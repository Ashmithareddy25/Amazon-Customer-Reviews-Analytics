B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's funny reading what 'naysayers' write on this,because it's written based on trivial purposes,..or for some malicious negative intent.  I have purchased 3 Madonna albums in my life. Ray of Light, American Life and this new one.  I have of course heard many of her other albums and her early dance singles are embedded in my brain of my childhood and adolescent experience.  But as an adult (that's over 30), I find this album to be her BEST EVER!  It is simply retro-simply obscure-simply unapologetic.   <br />the words are SUPPOSED to be simple..there is no need to search for deep lyrical content..it is SUPPOSED to be a fun, non threatening..sometimes silly, get up off your butt and dance album.  <br /> The songs are all mixed..giving it a non-stop party vibe.  Many styles of dance music are interpreted, 70's , 80's, 90's now and beyond.  It takes a good 3 or 4 listens for these songs to JUMP out at you and once again stay in your head forever. <br />  It crosses influences of Kraftwerk, DOnna Summer, Tom Tom Club, and even her own hits like a prayer and papa don't preach. <br /> <br />BUT NOTHING IS SAMPLED except the ABBA on HUNG UP (Hung Up is acyually my least favorite of the whole album)...the rest of the styles are cleverly crafted and produced in a swirl of circling sped rhythms, and many of the songs stand on their own. <br /> <br />DJ's will be going crazy on this album for the rest of the year...and it is perfect for a workout.  or cleaning around the house. <br /> <br />anyone who doesnt bop theior heads or tap their foot during this album seriously has a problem. <br /> <br />This is a great addition to my cd collection,..and it might even compell me to pick up some of her older material. <br /> <br />By the way,..I thought Ray of Light was phenomenal...I think Confessions on a dancefloor is even better. <br /> <br />I don't need to judge Madonna's choices, political opinions, what she does with her children, who she kisses, or what her age is. <br /> <br/>This has proven to me that age doesn;t matter. <br />When you are making good music and a fun, dance record. All that stuff doesn;t matter.  Madonna in my book, has been a true artist who has challenged the masses, questioned and explored, divided and united people...and that is what a true artist is.  Luckily for us,..she has put herself out there for over 20 years...and is still going strong.  She has never succumbed to falling off the planet,..or ever taking a break.  She keeps going...and I think that threatens people. <br /> <br />This album is pure fun!  and a great way to escape!
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Not new about it. This kind of singer do the same thing over and over. Madonna when you will learn? Can you create something new done by yourself? Stop copying and immitating others. This CD is really a piece of TRASH. Digustting!
0525948023|4.0|I was a HUGE fan of THE POWER OF NOW so Tolle's follow-up came as somewhat of a disappointment.  It is definitely worthwhile and a wonderful inspiration for tapping into the spiritual self.  However, on a purely personal note -- it didn't speak to me as strongly as NOW.  Also the entire premise of \\"Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\\" I found more than a bit misleading since this book primarily entails discovering the consciousness/being below all the SELF and MY labels.  It's a hybrid of Zen/Power of Now.  A beneficial read, some great ideas and food for thought, and yet somehow lacking.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Please don't collaborate with DJs!  Confessions disappointes, it is one long drum track with the same tempo that you can only enjoy if you are in a club and on drugs.  William Orbit took Madonna in the right direction, but everyone since has misled her.  A DJ is NOT a composer, and this music is no better than the click tracks Rap (hip hop) and R&B singers use.  No musical quality.  Just one sampled sound looped after another to the same basic beat and tempo.  I am severely disappointed.
B000A2WF3S|5.0|Let it never be said that Gidon Kremer's interpretations are in any way similar to... well, anyone. This is truly a fresh, and let me stress alternative take on these works- I would not recommend these to anyone not first initiated to Bach solo violin. If I were to recommend a place to start with these pieces, it would be Arthur Grumiaux, Henryk Szeryng, Nathan Milstein, or Hilary Hahn, as they present more (for lack of a better term) \\"mainstream\\" versions without Kremer's tendency towards more esoteric (yet totally effective) interpretations.    However, to those of you out there who are already familiar with the works, I say have at it: Kremer's reading is heartfelt, idiomatic, and very staccato yet never mechanical. He is certainly a student of performance, individuality, and taste. It is also quite worth it to hear the cleanliness of these discs: the sound and recording quality, as in all ECM recordings, is absolutely stellar.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The long wait is finally over and Madonna has done it once more. <br />Confessions on a Dancefloor is a non-stop mix of twelve tracks that review different styles of dance music, all of them reworked for a fresh sound. <br /> <br />Lyrically this is not Madonna's best work, but when you do dance music, the lyrics have to adapt to a certain beat or they don't work at all. <br /> <br />Hung Up is the first single and it's an upbeat, just dance and enjoy yourself kind of song. It samples ABBA's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight) in a very clever way. <br /> <br />Get Together is the first love song, very good for a slow dance, just follow Madonna and \\"Get Together\\" with a significant other. <br /> <br />Sorry (confirmed 2nd single) is a very catchy song, this one may not like you the first time but it definitely grows on oneself, you'll be repeating the chorus in no time. <br /> <br />Future Lovers which is reminiscent of Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\" and an obvious homage. It has a very fresh sound, if you know  Donna's sound then this song will feel very familiar. <br /> <br />I Love New York, ok, dance music isn't compatible with good lyrics but this one just can't be justified. It's silly, and very  weak. \\"I don't like cities, but I Love New York\\"/\\"Other cities, make me feel like a dork\\"--What the???. <br /> <br />This five songs are a different chapter on the album, probably referencing Madonna's first kind of silly (but good) songs and then we slowly get stronger lyrics like her present career offers. <br /> <br />Let It Will Be starts with a violin which reminds of \\"Papa don't Preach\\" or \\"Die Another Day\\", it's very good in the lyrics but the sound doesn't really feel like something new. <br /> <br />Forbidden Love, my personal favorite track is the second love song and has Madonna telling a tale of two lovers \\"Once upon a time, there was a boy and there was a girl\\"/\\"Hearts that intertwined, they lived in a different kind of world\\". It's the slowest song on the album but it's simply addictive with it's chorus saying \\"Forbidden Love\\"/\\"Are we supposed to be together?\\". <br /> <br />Jump (the 3rd single) is one of the best songs on the album, very upbeat, but you have to listen this one for yourself, after hearing it, you'll find yourself jumping all over the place. <br /> <br />How High brings back the preachy Madonna, but what a good prayer she has made!!!. Whether you like the lyrics or not (it talks about fame) \\"How high are the stakes?\\"/\\"How much fortune can you make?\\"/\\"Should I carry on?\\"/\\"Will it matter when I'm gone?\\", I assure you that this one will make you dance all over the place too. It probably has the more electronic sound of all the album. <br /> <br />Isaac can only be enjoyed if you're open to accept the sounds from cultures of South-eastern Europe or Asia that may make-it or breake-it. Although not very danceable, it's good on it's own. It's very tied to Madonna's study of Kabbalah. <br /> <br />Push has an R&B sound and a very good one at that, if you like R&B you'll simply fall in love with this song. It has a very good mood. <br /> <br />Like It Or Not really doesn't fit the theme of this album, it's Madonna's critic to the media, it's strong lyrically but it sounds nothing like dance music. Good track nonetheless.
B0000630YA|5.0|I remember the first time I heard this album, hearing Vincent Prices intro to \\"The Black Widow\\" \\"..and here's my prize, the Black Widow. Isn't she lovely and so deadly.\\"-just a segment from the intro. I loved this album from the very first time I heard it. I remembering wondering, \\"why is that guy in a tux, welcoming us to his nightmare?\\"  <br /> <br />Every song was just a perfect fit for this album. Moody, artistic, scary, sad, and violent, the songs covered a lot of bases.  <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this album.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Ok, the Emancipation of Mimi was one of the best Mariah Carey albums ever, but rereleasing this so soon? and with more of the same old songs? WHAT a RIPOFF!!!
B00000JPH6|2.0|I loved this movie as a child. I remember being tense, scared, thrilled and enjoying this movie at the same time. So did my girlfriend, so I bougth it to see this once-cherished movie. <br /> <br />The one good thing I will say about it is, the puppetry work from Jim Henson was really incredible. The movie, sad to say wasn't. <br /> <br />The plot was interesting, but weak. The dialogue was non-existant in most of the movie, very little amount of words. It was disturbing, and creepy. There was little substance in the characters, and they were all one-dimensional. <br /> <br />I give it one extra star for the puppetry work of Henson. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.
B000BJS4OY|1.0|I probably would have purchased this album, as it's an all-time classic, but unfortunately it's put out by Sony/BMG. This cd could be infected with Sony's spyware/virus rootkit application. Even if it's not, I refuse to give them my business. I don't trust them not to try to  infect my computer in the future.<br /><br />In fact, I'll never buy another Sony/BMG product ever again.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill Vol 1. Good, fast paced, and violent (a little too much) movie. The fight scenes in the movie were the best I've ever seen.  <br /> <br />The movie plot itself, was very basic. A revenge plot, with Uma Thurman setting out to kill all the people who brutally beat her, shot her, and put her in a coma (where she ends up getting pimped out and raped while unconcious). This movie was only the first part of the story.  <br /> <br />Very good movie. Strongly recommended for the fight scenes.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|AH, WHEN HE WAS TRULY 'THE BOSS'<br /><br />Am viewing/listening to the dvd '75 Hammersmith Odeon LONDON show, and it's electrifying.  Really. I don't usually write reviews before digesting , but I'm jumping in early and am completely sold.<br /><br />The audio quality is fantastic and is from a 24 track recording of the show.  The picture is a bit rough, shot in that horrible 70's film stock.  But the performance itself is phenomenal.<br /><br />A must buy for all who appreciate when Bruce's writing and performing revolved solely around his belief in rock and roll redemption.  'Born to Run' was a total musical escape from a grinding mid-seventies lower class reality. And it was huge for him as well as us.<br /><br />I came in during the 'Darkness' allbum and missed this tour so I've never seen live footage from this period.  The 'Darkness' tour and album was like a revelation to me at the time. I was just coming out of my adolescent 'Kiss' and 'Boston' phase and I was a depressed and isolated queer kid.  'Darkness' hit me in the gut the way no other album ever had or has ever had since. I soon bought 'Born to Run' and Bruce became my hero.<br /><br />Great anecdote about a meeting with him:  During the 'River' tour I saw Bruce at the Capitol Center in DC with a group of guys who were all Bruce freaks as well.  We decided to try to meet him after one show and went to the stage door and waited until around 5 in the morning. Other band members walked out, a few apparently very impressed with themselves (Max Weinberg you know who you are)then out he came in a Ford Bronco with a driver. When it was my turn to approach him I had nothing for him to sign except the sweaty folded stub for the show, but he took it and made a joke about it to put me at my ease. And he became a bit of a god for me, for awhile.<br /><br />So, before the 'Darkness' set in for Bruce, the depression years of 'The River' and the desolated 'Nebraska' the MEGA \\"BornInTheUSA' (which so got on my nerves with how misunderstood the title song was--does anyone else remember crowds at the shows pumping fists and waving flags like they were at a Nazi rally or something.  I even threw away the autograph I had on the ticket stub I was so irritated with it all.) Before all that there was 'Born to Run' and a great musician had a great fantasy we all wanted to be part of.<br /><br />All this from a guy who needed rock and roll like others need oxygen. Raised and apparently emotionally abused by an alcoholic father, he found salvation in a guitar. And so did we, for awhile.  I Love you Bruce.got on my nerves with how misunderstood the title song was--does anyone else remember crowds at the shows pumping fists and waving flags like they were at a Nazi rally or something.

B0009XT8YW|5.0|These two sing great together. Barbara kills me with her incredible voice. I can't wait to hear the new one coming out. You can easily get lost in this CD.
0380973464|5.0|This was the first book I've read by this author. Very impressed. Depth of characters, interlaced plots over two time periods, insightful techno. <br /> <br />As a software engineer, and student of maths, I really enjoyed reading about cryptography and fellow coders (wierd huh!) <br /> <br />Really recommend it (even if your not a geek you will still enjoy it) !
B000002ADT|5.0|How can you not love this? Miles Davis's mastery is so smooth. It is this CD that made me fall in love with Jazz. Not many can match it.
B000B8QF14|5.0|This is a great live show to watch, Green day are amazing live and i have been lucky to see them in March and lucky this came out b4 they return to Melbourne in dec which i already have my ticket for! <br />I loved how they mixed in the doco after each song, made it different then any other live DVD i own! By far the best band live, along with Disturbed! <br />There is only ONE small problem with it tho.... i have been a long time Green Day fan so i have seen and heard many of their songs live, since this is an \\"American idiot\\" tour i would have loved for this concert to have been the complete album of American idiot then followed up by their classics... Green Day have 8 cds ( if you include the best of which as 2 new tracks on it) so there is too many to choose from to satisfy every hardcore Green Day fan like me, ( like 2000 Light years away, welcome to paradise, waiting , poprocks and coke, and so on...)but im sure everyone would have been pumped for it to have the entire set of Idiot's cd since it is Green Day's crown jewel... yes everyone it IS better then Kerplunk and Dookie... well JUST better then Kerplunk :) funny thing is this was the same set list for the show i saw in March this year, didnt make it any less special tho, brought back great memories if anything :) <br />oh another small thing too,,, why did they cut \\"knowledge\\" outta the DVD, if it was the same as my concert i saw they would have got 3 ppl up on stage to play their instruments which was really good to see the band interact with their fans! <br />So this is a must for any Green Day fan, even the new teenie boppers who might not know songs like \\"Longview\\" and Basket case\\" :) <br />And Borgy, i know your a fellow Aussie mate but you sure you aint got no English in you? you cried a fair bit there mate, if your smart you would notice the doco parts (which made the DVD AWESOME!) are at the END of a song... yes thats right... so on DVD you can skip them and it will take none of your precious energy away and you can be happy coz you can make it like it is complete song after song, did you even think of that or was it too much effort..? So don't have a spaz about something that isn't a problem !! <br />Whoops lost my train of thought :)  <br />if your like me and love Green Day... you will LOVE this! A great cd/dvd for any Green Day fan!! i know i wont be getting sick of it anytime soon :) will be great for the lead up to the concert which is a month away! :D <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I went to a release party last night for this album and there wasn't a still body in the room. You can't help but jam to it. This album rocks! Madonna has a hit another home run with this one. She might be 47 but her finger is well and truly on the urban pulse. I'm still a fan 20 years later....
B0007GAERG|1.0|Definitely the worst Album of the Year. Not a single track stands out. Bland boring same old Mariah songs. Her music died since Music Box. Don't waste your money on this. Better off to give your money to charity.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|\\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is arguably the most talked about album of 2005. It features the decade's #1 smash hit, \\"We Belong Together\\" which ruled the Hot 100 for a staggering 14 weeks and broke all sorts of records. Another huge hit, \\"Shake It Off\\" was the #1 played song in America for a few weeks and one of this year's most popular songs. \\"It's Like That\\", the catchy first single off the album is also here of-course. But it's really the new tracks that are supposed to be reviewed here. Well, let me tell you, I would have paid a lot more even just for these 4 songs. They are absolutely brilliant. The best one being \\"So Lonely\\"; Mariah decided to name it \\"One & Only\\" part 2 but I think it's so much better than that song. The beat is hot and Mariah's bridge just makes the song all the more worthy. \\"Make It Last\\" is another winner - Mariah sings in a powerful, full voice and creates a track which is easily one of the best on the whole album. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is the current single in the US, making big leaps towards the top 10 as I write this review. I don't find it derivative of \\"We Belong Together\\" at all. It's a great track. The last song on the album is the remix to \\"We Belong Together\\". While I'm not a big fan of remixes, this one just takes the original to the next level. It's a celebration of Mariah's voice and great music. It also received some nice airplay during the song's reign on the charts. There is also a DVD featuring the 4 videos released from MIMI (excluding \\"Don't Forget\\"). They are hot as you probably know by now. The #1 selling album of 2005 is a must have in your collection.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna at her best. This is a must-have for all Madonna fans as well as all who love to dance. There is not one bad track. Listened to it pumped out and it takes you to a different world, definitely a feel good world. Your feet will not stop. Catchy hooks and choruses will be ringing in my mind and ears for a very long time.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is phenomenal.  Way better than \\"Music\\" and \\"American Life.\\"  Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|To my humble opinion \\"Band of Brothers\\" is one of the best miniseries and definately the best war movie ever. I remember here in Russia some time ago the release of the series on video was streched for five weeks - every two episodes were coming out every Thursday. And I can't recall of some other film I was waiting more anxiously for. \\"Band of Brothers\\" graphically demonstrates what it means when a budget is spent wisely.<br />There are no first-rate stars in the film (I think Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, David Schwimmer and Neal McDonough are not considered as ones with all my respect) but acting impresses a lot. You have not a glimpse of a doubt all that's happening on screen is true. The story-line is very intense like it should be in a war film and at the same time very thoughtful. It's not just an action movie, it's a real drama based on real events. And it's amazing to watch the main characters during all ten episodes as they mature physically and mentally.<br />The edition itself it brilliant, it contains a lot of useful information about the history of Easy company. Besides there's a Ron Livingston's video diary of the days in boot camp all the actors had to pass before the shooting in the miniseries.<br />This custom case DVD costs a lot but it is sure worth purchasing - maybe like no other edition available.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Charmed, it's the most excelent comedy, drama and everything that I saw in my life, I love it !!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|What ear candy, this! If you loved \\"Ray of Light\\" (as did I), you will really dig this cd. No song-by-song analysis- just know this is a fun disc with great hooks and overall it conveys the playful and funky spirit for which Madonna is known.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I'm 25yrs old and I feel 13yrs old again! WHOOHOO! Madonna somehow is able to mystically bend time and age. This album is amazing! It's truely as if Madonna can never not tap into her inner teen spirit. The song's beats are nonstop! The energy is booty shaking fun. No poltical views (American Life didn't win Kerry the election, good try Madge! but America hated your album)This album isn't self indulgent, it's just pure fun clubbing energy! I love How High it's such an classic Madonna song. And you can't help but fall in love with I Love New York! Anyway Madonna has always paved the path for worthy Pop music and this album just once again redirects us to how good and intresting Pop music can be. I hope all who buy it LOVE IT! because MADONNA RULES!
068987474X|5.0|i thought the book was great and I loved how Greg has a response for every scenario he was given.  I recomend this book to every teenage girl whose either in a relationship or not in a relationship.  Greg translates what guys really say and what they mean, and it's great.  My girlfriend read this book and she started doubting her relationship..great book.
0307276902|5.0|My partner Martin and I read this book--we adore Oprah!  We found it moving and completely captivating.  Highly recommended!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Once you made it past the ups and downs, it's all the same again. 5 extra tracks that feel BADLY refurbished.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Just an imitator who happens to have a good voice but no talent. Natural qualities don't make the artist.
0930289528|5.0|About two or three years ago, I read just about every single dystopian novel I could get my hands on; call it a bizarre phase brought on by adolescence, but for some reason, V for Vendetta escaped my attention until quite recently, perhaps because it was a graphic novel.  I stumbled across some sort of cheesy promotion for the movie quite by accident, took one look at the synopsis, and decided it was worth a sampling of the source material.  I read about fifteen pages before deciding that I had to have a copy of my own. <br /> <br />That was probably the best book buy I've made this year.  V for Vendetta has a sort of edgy, gritty, hyper-reality that few novels in any genre possess.  The juxtaposition of the ordinary with the ugly and the unnerving is brilliant and wonderfully jarring.  What perhaps surprised me the most was the subtlety and depth in V for Vendetta.  Most books about dystopian futures can be distilled into \\"Government system/philosophy/belief X is bad and will crush humanity.\\"  V for Vendetta presents two equally misunderstood and maligned ideologies, anarchy and fascism; there is no one fighting for \\"justice\\" or \\"truth\\" or all of those trite terms we've been bombarded with since grade school.  We are left with questions about V, Susan, and whether violence is truly justified.  V in particular forces us to ponder questions we probably never dreamed of: very few people question justice as a noble ideal, yet V leaves an explosive Valentine and a disturbing speech at the feet of Madam Justice.   <br /> <br />I strongly recommend V for Vendetta, but with this caveat: it is unwise for those who cannot or will not attempt to understand the implications of actions in the book to read it.  It's not by any means necessary to understand the plot; for the most part, the surface story is fairly straightforward, even if the white, mid-level bureaucratic men are a little hard to keep track of.  But it's not the story of V for Vendetta that counts.  It's the message, the idea, that gives V his true power.  Neither is it necessary to recognize all the allusions to previous literature and philosophy, but again, the more you know, the more V for Vendetta will offer. <br />
B0000DD7LB|1.0|all i have to say this is a piece of crap  kids might enjoy this from 6 to 13 years old but thats it ...funny record
B000B8QEZG|5.0|With the release of this album, madonna has finally reached a place of creativity unseen in any of her previous works. Whilst Ray Of Light was a masterful album, and signalled the modern era madonna, everything about this album just feels right. The production is flawless, the lyrics range between the introspective to the down-right campy, and the beats are out of this world. this album comes 'premixed', meaning you can simnply pop it in at any party, and forget about skipping any tracks. <br /> <br />Hung Up 10/10:  <br />What can I say, this is one brilliant song, and a wonderful way to kick off the album. The ABBA sample is a bonus to the infectious lyrics and pounding beat. <br /> <br />Get Together 10/10: <br />Absolute perfection. You will honestly believe you have been transported into an Eighties Discoteque, with platforms and all. The chorus to this song is pure pop perfection, and madonna's Vocals are a throwback to here early days. <br /> <br />Sorry 10/10: <br />Rounding out the strongest opening trilogy of any madonna album ever-made, is Sorry, a song so infectious and pefect, you won't believe your ears. This song hails the return of the sexy madonna, who isn't gonna take any crap from an ex-lover. The lyrics are second to the pulsating beat, immaculately produced by Stuart Price. <br /> <br />Future Lovers 9/10: <br />Future Disco would be the best way to describe the sound of this track. A sexy Spoken introduction, ala erotica, brings the song into a viciously grinding beat, which will have you in the 'zone' in no time. <br /> <br />I Love New York 10/10: <br />Attention critics, stop criticising the lyrics to this song. They are intetionally simple and camp, and if you can't pick that up, then you shouldn't be listening to a Madonna album in the fist place. Driving melody and beat, will have you hooked instantly. <br /> <br />Let It Will Be 9/10:  <br />Spiritual and Wiser Madonna kicks in at this point, but don't worry, the beat and production morethan makes up for it. Lyrically, I think this is one of the stronger tracks on the record, and fans will appreciate it. <br /> <br />Forbidden Love 10/10: <br />This song is suprisingly haunting, yet sexy, and is definately one of the album's highlights. The trance-like beat, coupled with sexy and sensual lyrics, make this a must listen. Far superior to the 1994 Forbidden Love. <br /> <br />Jump 10/10: <br />High energy retro jam, that will have you on your feet and jumping in no time. This is slated for release as a single, and will definately do well. <br /> <br />How High 11/10:  <br />My favourite song on the album. The lyrics are heart-felt, as madonna confesses her egotistic past desires. The chrous is to die for, with a bass line that will have your house shaking. Pure perfection , and possible the best madonna song of all time. The entire album is worth purchasing just for this track. <br /> <br />Isaac 8/10: <br />This is Madonna's tribute to kabballah, and like it or not, the infectious melody will have you hooked. Pure genius <br /> <br />Push 9/10: <br />This is the sexiest Madonna song in a while. Lyrically, she is thanking a certain someone for 'pushing' her to be a better person. An infectious, but simple, beat drives the song. <br /> <br />Like It Or Not 10\10: <br />This is a great way to end an amazing album, and has a breathier air to it, as if the party is ending, and you are the last one left. Excellent track! <br /> <br />So basically, if you only purchase one album this year, let it be this one.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I CAN'T BEALIVE AFTER ALL THIS YEARS OF MAKIN MUSIC MADONNA CAME UP WITH THIS AWSOME CD IT MAKES ME LAUGH CAUSE PPL THINK THAT BRITNEY IS SOMETHING BUT SHE SHOULD JUST BOW THE QUEEN OF THE DANCE MADONNA IS THE BEST DANCE FEMALE ARTIST OF ALL TIMES AND WITH THIS CD THERE SHOULUNT BE A SINGLE DOUBT <br />
B00097DX3U|3.0|Overall, the songs are actually melodic for hard rockers, despite Chris Cornell's gritty voice and some of the awful, noisy guitar solos, a trademark left over from Rage Against the Machine.  I can't stand some of the loud, discordant and random solos that are peppered throughout about half the songs on this album.  The solos sound sort of like an Eddie Van Halen solo, except more random, noisier and suckier; I can't stand them, and that was the tiebreaker between 3 and 4 stars, causing me to give this album three stars.  Still, I do recommend the album.   <br /> <br />The fact that I think this album is more than \\"just okay\\" speaks well for Audioslave, since it's hard for me to listen to this sort of music anymore - at least to get to give a new hard rock album half a chance.  I still think that \\"Be Yourself\\" and \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" are the best songs musically, and I have not heard them too much on the radio because I rarely listen to the sorts of radio stations that play those songs.  I have not listened closely to the songs' lyrics yet though.  Other people here seem to think that the lyrics are actually quite good, so keep that in mind when listening to the album. <br /> <br />I've never listened to the Audioslave's first album (and probably never heard any songs from it) and I don't usually listen to this type of music.  Well, I did back in the 90s in the heyday of Brendan O'Brien-produced hard rock acts like Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam and of course Soundgarden, but nowadays I find myself listening to singer-songwriters and rock/pop groups more often.  I have Toad the Wet Sprocket, Weezer, Killers, Nelly Furtado, Kathleen Edwards, Jack Johnson, Bonnie Raitt, Modest Mouse, and Green Day CDs at work now.  I guess I've mellowed out, even though I'm only 27. <br />
0553801503|5.0|Five long, long years ago, a nineteen year old (going on twenty) college student finished \\"A Storm of Swords\\", with the tremendous revelation of the transformation of Catelyn Stark, the demise of Tywin Lannister, the fall of Lysa Arryn, with a changed, war ravaged Westeros- and with the prospect of a two years wait for \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", where all these plotlines, and more, would be continued.    Time passed.  The Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process has failed and rose and collapsed again.  The Twin Towers have fallen, as has the regime of Sadam Hussein.  George W. Bush is still the American President, properly elected this time.  The college student is now in another country, with a new job and new complications.  I've known love bitter and true, met new people and seen new places, had new experiences.  I've fronted a rock band and stopped, almost entirely, reading Fantasy fiction.  I've AGED.    As for George R. R. Martin, too, things have changed.  The Dragons will still dance, but not in this book.  Now the Crows are feasting, and the planned gap between the events of books 3 and 4 in A Song of Ice and Fire is gone- along with Martin's assurances that there will be six books and six only.    So, across this gap - a new world, a different reader, an altogether different book then the one expected - what does the 25 year old me say about the continuation of the saga I fell in love with in my teens?  Does it still hold out?  What it the verdict?    Well, it's utterly, absolutely, no holds barrel brilliant.    Oh, there are faults.  There always has been.  This series is imperfect, and from a technical point of view, this volume is the weakest in the series, so far.  Critics are right to complain about the pace, about the absence of our favorite characters, of Brienne running into all of the characters from \\"A Storm of Swords\\".  The structure is weaker as well - do we really need three new point of view characters each for the events of Dorn and the Iron Islands?Davos had been all the eyes we ever needed for Stannis's Court - why do we need so many onlookers on the Dornish Marshes?    But this is not the point and never has been.  Martin's books are about his world, his dream, his characters and history and drama.  Its about the creeping magic and the gathering storm, it's about the bloody aftermath as well as the glorious battles, and the way in which the great revolutions leave a terrible after taste.  The War of the Five Kings is over.  This is the aftermath - it's messy, it's terrible - and, like the rest of A Song of Ice and Fire, it's true to real life (with Dragons).    Unlike the previous books, a Feast for Crows is more a character study then an action thriller.  Meet Tywin Lannister's sister, Genna, and her observation that Tyrion, and Jaime, is Tywin's son.  See Jaime's Lannister's hurt from the betrayal of his sister.  Meet Sansa Stark's struggles to survive, and Samwell's Tarly struggles for honor.  Encounter the Master Aemon Targaryen, in exile from his last home on the wall.  This is their story.  This is the Song of Ice and Fire.     So the twenty-five years old me closed the last pages of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" with all the reverence that my nineteen years old self opened \\"A Game of Thrones\\".  I hope that I won't have to wait another five years to read the first lines of \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", but as long as the Song is true, the signs that time leave on both the Singer and the Audience will not prevent me from asking for an encore.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is by far my favorite presentation of Shania's incredible music--she's live, she's alive, and she keeps that audience of 50,000 people on their feet and loving her for over two hours. <br /> <br />I'm a recent fan of Shania's (must have been asleep) and have several of her CDs and DVDs.  This is by far my favorite, because of the incredible connectedness between her and her audience, fueled by her complete command of her material, her near-unbelievable stage presence, and the obvious love that she and the audience keep blowing back and forth. <br /> <br />Her CDs are wonderful (especially The Best of Shania Twain) and the other videos I have are fine--her costumes are actually sexier on The Platinum Collection--but if I had to choose only one disk, this would be the winner.
0783231032|3.0|While not as horrible as many critics would lead you to believe, Steven Spielberg's 1941 is somewhat of a bomb, considering the wunderkid's past record.  1941 is way too long and while there are some wonderful comic bits, there are far more that fizzle than explode.  The story which focuses on the paranoia in California after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor has too many subplots that aren't all that interesting:  the dancing kids for example or Tim Matheson and Nancy Allen's airplane love scenes; much of what John Belushi does seems forced and added for comic relief that isn't all that funny.  Lots of fun performances though:  Robert Stack as General Stilwell enjoying the movie DUMBO; Slim Pickens' self parodying role as the Christmas tree man; the opening sequence in which the girl who opened Spielberg's JAWS repeats the scene with a submarine standing in for the great white; Lorraine Gary's terror in losing her home and her hatred of guns.  There's lots of spectacular explosions and demolitions and lots of noise; it's a rather noisy movie.  1941 is one of those movies Spielberg probably enjoyed making; too bad the audience could only enjoy the parts instead of the whole.
B000000HSU|3.0|Bad brains did not invent hardcore,that is a Politically-correct inspired myth.hardcore began in California with bands like The germs,FEAR,Black Flag and others who started to play punk in a harder and faster style then the ramones or sex pistols.The first band to really take it up a notch and play in that jaw-dropping ultrafast style was a band called the Middle class,whose first single 'out of vogue'came out in 1978,more then two years before 'pay to cum'.as an old school punk I can assure you this Bad brains- created- hardcore crap didnt begin till the early 90s,and is more then likely influenced by the color of their skin then anything else.anyway I against I is far better then rock for light,so get that CD instead.<br /><br />Bnadso
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I had high expectations about this movie.  It's a psychological thriller where the Jigsaw Killer essentially forces his victim's to die or kill the other person in the room with them.   <br /> <br />This movie was a huge disappointment.  It was not smart, not well acted, not a good plot.  I just didn't find it plausable, especially the ending. I guess you'll have to judge for yourselves, but two feet down for me. The rest of this review contains spoilers. <br /> <br />*SPOLIER ALERT* <br /> <br />Here are some of my problems <br /> <br />1. The guy lying on the floor the whole time and they didn't know he was alive.  Plus he has tape player in one hand, gun in the other, and electruction button where? Sorry not buying it. <br /> <br />2. You don't know if Dr. Gordon lives or dies. <br /> <br />3.  The guy kills Adam for losing the game.  I didn't know he was playing a game.  What was it?  I thought Dr. Gordon was playing the game. <br /> <br />4.  The orderly who is \\"innocent\\" and kidnaps the wife and kid decides to hold a stethoscope to their hearts to hear their fear but he's not even the bad guy.  Stupid. <br /> <br />5.  The bad guy is terminal and in the hospital but he is perfectly fine when it comes to building the face-ripper-aparter and barb-wire maze. <br /> <br />6.  The whole thing about Adam taking pictures of Gordon and that's how they wound up together. Retarded. <br /> <br />7. Danny Glover and his parter have the bad guy.  Danny Glover is pointing a shotgun at him, the partner is trying to stop the head-drilling machine.  The partner shoots the drills.  Somehow this distracts Danny Glover and the bad guy gets away.  What the f***?  That's so stupid.  Then the bad guy gets shot in the back with a shotgun then gets up and runs away.  Brother. <br /> <br />8. Finally, I just couldn't buy into the fact that Gordon would saw his foot off.  Even at one's most irrational point you have to know it'll take like half an hour to saw through the bone and then you'll bleed to death, and then you don't know where they are so you won't get to them for who knows how long.  Plus, wouldn't you pass out before you could saw your foot all the way off.  Anyway <br /> <br />P.S.  I have to credit some of these points to earlier reviews, they're not all mine.
0553801503|3.0|A Feast for Crows (AFfC) picks up right where the action left off in A Storm of Swords. Perhaps I should say storyline rather than action - AFfC is severely lacking in action and intrigue. For those of you that enjoy world-building and meeting new characters in a now familiar fantasy world, you will be well served. Also, if you enjoy the minutiae of details about noble houses, and the everyday gore of a war-torn medieval land you have plenty to feast upon.  Otherwise.... <br /> <br />Characters <br />If you are hoping to read more about the characters that you got hooked on at the beginning of the series, be careful. Of the 8 original Game of Thrones POV characters (Arya, Bran, Catelyn, Danaerys, Eddard, Jon, Sansa and Tyrion), 2 are given voice in this volume for a grand total of 6 chapters. For some of us, that hurts. The few Samwell and Arya chapters will not disappoint, and Jaime has his moments.  <br /> <br />Pacing and Plot <br />Although similar in size to A Game of Thrones (AGoT), this volume is much slower in pace, which can be highlighted by the big difference in the number of chapters - 46 for AFfC vs. a whopping 73 for AGoT. Less chapters means a slower gait, and the sometimes breathless pace of the first three volumes is all but gone, as the events that are covered here focus on what happens as the war (at least temporarily) dies down. <br /> <br />Development <br />There are 9 new POV characters in this volume, many of whom get little screen time and less action. This makes for much less of a payoff in terms of character development, as new characters step in and out of the story before the reader can form a connection with their perspective. As for the 3 characters which carry the bulk of the book, none of them has the charisma of a Jon or Tyrion and none of them undergo any significant character shifts, either. The Martin hallmark of a bad guy turning good or a good guy turning bad is sorely missed. <br /> <br />Outlook <br />Martin is clearly tryingto expand the scope of his series, and a book about recovering from war is both realistic and clearly meant to establish a new order for the conflicts that will undoubtedly arise in future volumes. Despite my criticisms, I doubt that this is a novel which most Martin fans will want to skip. Read it. Absorb. And let's hope that Martin realizes that an endless cast of POVs from around the world does not have the same dramatic effect as following the trials and tribulations of just a few characters.
B000006YYW|5.0|I did not expect this cd tho be all that great. The Bee Gees are the greatest ever in history but after i heard Cucumber Castle, i thought they could never be all that great without being whole. In and Out Of Love is a great song. I think it should be a single, but oh well. Juliet and Another... are pretty good singles, and in the One For All concert, Juliet sounds 20 times better when sung by the group. The other songs that I like on this cd are Kathy's Gone and I Believe In Miracles. I still need to get his other 3 solo albums, before Magnet, which is a horrible cd. But overall, a must have solol album for BeeGees fans.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|There are only a few bands in the world someone could listen to, and immediately know the song belonged to them. Daft Punk is one of them.  <br /> <br />The band continues with their signature robot inspired vocals and ultramodern computer programming, but what is strikingly different here is that the tracks on here are more repetitive as compared to ones on Homework and Discovery - and it is exactly this quality that makes this album strangely so much more profound than the earlier two releases.  <br /> <br />All 10 tracks on Human After All portray a multitude of different emotions, which the French duo obviously want us to experience through repetition of sounds for 4 minutes or so that each track lasts for.  <br /> <br />Not as mainstream or accessible as the previous two releases, but a stunner nevertheless.
B000BGH22W|4.0|This soundtrack was definitely different from the first three and although I really enjoyed them I thought that it was nice to change things up a bit. As for the last three tracks I agree with the other reviewers that they are a bit of a shock, but if you go back to the book and read over the chapter about the Yule Ball you will discover that the Weird Sisters are the group performing at the ball and it makes perfect sense that they were included in the soundtrack. Overall, I think that this soundtrack is a great addition to anyone's Harry Potter collection and reminds everyone that this book is where everything begins to change.
B00097A5I6|4.0|The lads from Manchester continue with their strong form to release their sixth studio album Don't Believe The Truth.  <br /> <br />What is immediately noticeable with this album is how much the band has matured musically. Oasis have probably realized they've proven themselves countless times and that they no longer have anything left to prove to the listener. What this results in is a more complete sound: a band that has thrown all caution to the wind to record an album that is more sincere and straight from the heart.  <br /> <br />That is why there is no point in comparing The Truth with (What's The Story) Morning Glory? or Be Here Now, because the focus of the music has completely changed. But of course, what still remains is the attitude, which frankly, Oasis couldn't get rid of even if they consciously tried to.  <br /> <br />Listen without prejudice and you will love this record.
0553801503|3.0|I love the first three books. However, this one really seems to just meander around with not much happening.  I found myself daydreaming as I was reading throughout most of the book.  There are some good parts, but I wish I would have got this one from the library.  <br /> <br />I am not a big fan of abridged audio books, but I thinki that would be the best way to get this installment.  I really hope that Martin does a better job with Dance of Dragons otherwise I am finished with his books.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|Juan Diego Florez gives a fantastic performance in this opera. \\"Cessa di Piu\\" really brings the house down. This is a Must Have item.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|What a marvelous album.  This shows the versatility and understanding of a maturing woman combined with the exuberance of a dance diva...which she is.  Welcome back Madonna!  Great job...I will dancing all winter!
B0007P3582|4.0|this album gets so much hate, and all because of a bunch of fickle fans who now think of Rapper The Game as Jesus. to be honest the sophmore album is not good enough to match the platinumx8 smash hit get rich or die tryin'. still the album is quite good.      1. Intro n/a    2. In My Hood 4/5 beat is so damn dope    3. This Is 50 3/5 this song is really hardcore     4. I'm Supposed To Die Tonight 5/5 aka Many Man II    5. Piggy Bank 5/5 WEAK DISS but its such a great beat, and funny too. the video is hilarious.     6. Gatman And Robin 2/5 ehh Gatman and Robin??? kinda corny, plus i thought Dre was Gatman    7. Candy Shop 3/5 not my type of song but it's a hit and scott storch does a great job.    8. Outta Control 3/5 dre proves why he's one of the best producers    9. Get In My Car 4/5 this is my type of song, i played this song all summer in the whip    10. Ski Mask Way 5/5 The best song here. beat is amazing.    11. A Baltimore Love Thing 2/5 bad concept song..    12. Ryder Music 2/5 this song is so boring    13. Disco Inferno 4/5 ok this really felt like In Da Club pt.2 when it droped.    14. Just A Lil Bit 3/5 good song scott storch does another great job.    15. Gunz Come Out 3/5 AKA Heat II    16. My Toy Soldier 3/5 this track is dope yayo really did impress considering his CD is A class garbage.     17. Position Of Power 5/5 really laid back beat, 50's flow is untouchable.     18. Build You Up 3/5 Scott Storch does it yet AGAIN but 50 and does it yet again too, with another girl song!    19. God Gave Me Style 4/5 good song, real deep but again too short...    20. So Amazing 0/5ok this just sounds like Ja rule's and Ashanti's song w/o all the screaming    21. I Don't Need 'Em 4/5 wow way to rip off ghostface....but its     22. Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix) 5/5 better than the original. Lloyd banks kills this song. he IS the best in G-Unit, tony yayo does well, young buck does his thang too.    I rate this 3.5 (Generous some would say)    1. Ski Mask Way  2. Position Of Power  3. Get In My Car  4. I'm Supposed To Die Tonight  5. Piggy Bank
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I'm a 28 year old Madonna fan, her music has always been in the background of my life. It took \\"Ray of light\\" to make me realize just how much of a fanatic I am.  <br /> <br />When I first heard \\"Hung up\\" I got chills, I loved it! <br /> <br />I have to say after listening to this album that it is one of my favorites already! I love the album, I like every song, and I don't feel the need to skip over any of the songs. <br /> <br />A few of my favorites already:  <br /> <br />Hung up <br />Sorry <br />Forbidden Love <br />Push <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This CD is unbelievalbe!  Madonna fans WILL NOT be disappointed!  Dance fans will not be disappointed.  If you love dance music, then you'll truly enjoy this CD.  The music sounds really, REALLY good!!   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, her lyrics seem to play as the background for the music and her voice on a majority of the songs.  SHE IS SAYING SOMETHING (religous undertones?), listen closely even when the music distracts you.  :o)  <br /> <br />I agree with others, this is an instant classic!  Buy it and DANCE!!  This CD will keep you on your feet!!
B000A59PMO|4.0|This is a good show. Unfortunately it does not garner much in the ratings department since it is on UPN and up against Lost on Wednesday nights. It's a little bit Buffy (a butt-kicking heroine), a little O.C. (it's set in a fictional wealthy town in southern California), and a little Twin Peaks (the show centers on the murder of Veronica's best friend, Lily Kane). Kristin Bell shines as Veronica. Some of the stand alone episodes could have been stronger, but Veronica's determination to find Lily's murderer keeps the series going. As one reviewer said, the last four to five episodes are really good. Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy, has lavished quite a lot of praise on the show. The first season was a great start. Coincidentally, Alyson Hannigan guest starred on the show in the first season, and Charisma Carpenter has become a series regular in the second.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|How many stars do we have still this good after 20 years? I love this CD, simply because it is Madonna...Hang up is a good opening act. But my favorite is Sorry.. Let it will be is damn good too. Isaac reminded me some RAy of Light tunes. I love the pictures in the CD cover...She is still beautiful. She has a lot those 20 yeard old starlets need to learn...Again, love this CD. It is fun and refreshing...For God's sake, She is MADONNA. one and only Madonna....that should be enough
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After wowing audiences with her politically charged \\"American Life\\" CD, Madonna releases \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor,\\" which is easily the hottest and most anticipated album of the year!  This album is COOKIN' with lots of beats and rhythms; it's very dancey.  The song \\"Hung Up\\" has an ABBA sample that is out of this world!  Madonna is back in the saddle where she belongs, and I predict that this record will sell though the roof. You NEED to get this and you need to get this now!
B0000009S3|5.0|This is the genius of Frank Zappa. He was the jazz-rock pioneer who hated jazz but nevertheless altered the course of the music's history with this extraordinary album. No doubt this is Frank Zappa's first major guitar blowout (Willie The Pimp) plus a heap of fantastic instrumental stuff (Son Of Mr. Green Genes). So \\"turn on\\" and enjoy it. Too much!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!!!  I can't believe that after more than 20 years, Madonna can come up with the best work of her career.  There are no fillers on this album.  The only problem is deciding which track is my favorite.  It seems to change at every listen.  BRAVO MADONNA.  You really delivered this time.
0375701427|5.0|Philip Roth, certainly among the half-dozen very best novelists writing in America during the second half of the Twentieth Century, will be among the very few still read a hundred years from now. And it wouldn't surprise me if AMERICAN PASTORAL is at the top of his reading list. It's his masterpiece.<br /><br />Swede Levor, legendary Newark High School athlete, inheritor of his father's glove factory, husband of former Miss New Jersey, seems to have it all. But then his daughter commits an act of political terrorism, a bombing, that leaves people dead. Swede's world is shattered, and he tries to figure out where and why the train has derailed.<br /><br />It's in this inner searching that Roth proves his mastery as a writer. Told in the words of a first-person omnipotent narrator, Swede's life story unfolds. The tone of the book is perfect: steady, informative, never hysterical - though the bitterness and incomprehension of Swede's daughter's (her name is, ironically, Merry) act is fully brought out. Roth's command of language and his deep understanding of his characters are magnificently displayed. We are drawn into the story effortlessly and the challenge to understand Swede's life and his daughter's motivation is made so compelling that it becomes difficult to put the book down. Without a doubt, this is Roth's best novel (PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT  and THE PROFESSOR OF DESIRE are his next best books, but even they lack the power and authority shown here). A marvelous achievement.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am a HUGE Madonna fan, so I'll try to be as unbiased as possible. I have followed her career since she started and I always look forward to what she offers next!  Madonna has always had a remarkable instinct of knowing exactly what the music world needs, exactly when it needs it!  She has rescued us from the clutches of the very tiresome rap and hip-hop.  If you don't get up and dance ... or at least WANT to.... you MUST be dead! The music is ingeniously layered with non-stop DANCE beats. Though the CD is not as fun as I thought it would be, it's still F'ing FANTASTIC !!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna has done it again with her new album Confessions on a Dance Floor. This is a non-stop album that goes back to her dancing roots. The lyrics are deep and meaningful while the melody is very catchy. Each song has its unique and powerful points. <br /> <br />Hung Up is the opening song, it samples ABBA's Gimme Gimme Gimme. It features simple lyrics that collaborates with the music and can make the listener think about the concept of time. It's an above average track, but not the best. So if you liked Hung Up, you'll be amazed. <br /> <br />Get Together is pretty standard compared to the rest of the album, very dancy. <br /> <br />Sorry is COADF's upcoming second single. The song definitly deserves the part. The opening part where Madonna sings 'I've heard it all before' several times is simply amazing. <br /> <br />Future Lovers has some inspiring lyrics, sound-wise it is pretty regular in this album. <br /> <br />I Love New York sings about her love for New York, obviously. Madonna's vocals in this song are very powerful. <br /> <br />Let It Will Be has some simply stunning lyrics, and is without a doubt the most dancy song on the album. <br /> <br />Forbidden Love is a very memorable song that deals with Madonna's usual theme of love. It is catchy, but can leave your subconcious kind of sad because of the occasional deep and coarse vocals. <br /> <br />Jump is again pretty standard. But can make you think about how precious time is. <br /> <br />How High is a song that offers some sound effects from the old Paradise song. It is very different, and isn't that what Madonna is good at? Being different? <br /> <br />Issac is very defined and unique. It has a man telling a traditional tale learned in Kabbalah when Madonna is not singing. Every beat in this song is executed clear and fresh. It is innovative and a standout track. <br /> <br />Push is a song about how someone is pushing Madonna to reach higher and 'Go the extra mile'. Madonna expresses gratitude as well as complains about this someone. It is faster than the rest of the album, a standout track. <br /> <br />The last song is Like It Or Not. Madonna starts by saying 'You call me a sinner or you can call me a saint. Celebrate me for who I am.' And that's how she wants you to feel, whether you like the album or not at the end, just appreciate it for what it is. She also says 'You can love me or leave me.' Frankly I don't think she cares if someone doesn't like the album. <br /> <br />Do not listen to those negative reviews, they all wish Madonna died years ago, but Madonna once said herself 'People think they will wake up one day and I'll be gone. But I'm never going away.' That should be good enough for everyone. <br /> <br />Lastly, buy this album. You will be pleasantly surprised.
140004281X|5.0|Alice Munro's stories are less about plot and more about mood --like no other author, she is able to evoke feelings with a single sentence -- to convey a character's despair, loneliness, sense of isolation and brief happiness with only a word or two. I can never quite grasp how she does it.<br /><br />These stories, which take place throughout Canada, are about people escaping, or trying to escape, their narrow lives. Three stories are entertwined with the same characters, and we get almost a novella that is impossible to put down. In each case, Munro manages to pull us in to the minds of her characters, even when, as is often the case, we have nothing whatsoever in common with them--and even though they are not always likeable.<br /><br />I won't detail the stories here because they need discovery. Simply open the book and fall into the pages and be thrilled by Munro's always brilliant writing.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Freedom of Mimi or not, this album is gross. True Mariah is a good singer and true we should all love 'Mimi' and true we've all heard the positive response for this album. But it's not as good as you think. Every track on this album sounded the same. The same whirly loose R&B beats, the same pitch, the same theme, the same mood, the same feel. If you love R&B/Mariah to the fact you listen to it/her 24/7, by all means buy this horribly repetitive and unworthy album. Otherwise stay away and hope that next time, Mariah doesn't produce all her songs in one day.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|COADF is a full dance disc, it is totally oriented to the dance floor, so that's why maybe some people may feel strange at the beginning, listening to the CD in your car or home doesn't really fit, I would recommend to take it with you while you go jogging or at least go walking so you are in motion.  Then you can feel the beat pumping.  The album has its ups and downs, the first 4 songs (Hung up, Get together, Sorry and Future lovers) are very catchy and you will be dancing and singing to them very soon, all very good.  It falls down with I love New York, the song lacks the power of the previous 4.  The next song, Let it will be, doesn't really pick up the pace until Forbidden love takes the beat with the same feeling of the beginning of the album.  Isaac and Push  are good songs, nothing extraordinary, I really prefer Jump and How high songs over these, especially Jump where Madonna's voice is clearly over the sounds making it more recognizable.  Like it or not closes the session of a good dancing album.  I honestly think the album is pretty good, those who don't like it may have been expecting music to listen at the office, which is not the case.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|But this is not a impressive album, it's just more electronic dance club music that will make many Madonna's fans very happy...Hung Up is ok, the only commercial song on this album, Get Together, Future Lovers, I Love New York, Like It Or Not sounds like those songs from Erotica, Bedtime Stories and Ray Of Light....Sorry is an enjoyable song but it's nothing to say WOW...Let It Will Be, i like this songs, it's very 80's, Forbidden Love the slowest track on this album...nothing special about it, Jump and How High are boring, Isaac is really good to dance to, Push...boring too. <br /> <br />So this album wasn't what Warner and Madonna told people that was going to be...(\\"back to her roots\\" \\"totally dance album\\" \\"confessions on a dance floor\\"...), what a good way to promote something like this, don't expect this songs to be heard on the radio or becoming hits...
B00005QY5Y|5.0|it's just not right to mix such great songs with such bad songs, but it's also just not right to give any less than 5 stars.  this album is split right down the middle--the first 8 songs are great, the last 8 aren't.  maybe the idea is that you can't really appreciate songs this good unless you put em next to mediocre to bad songs.  best song on here is \\"somehow, someday\\" which completely blows me away.  then there's \\"when the stars go blue\\", \\"new york, new york\\", \\"answering bell\\", \\"firecracker\\".  these are the best songs.  but \\"la cienega just smiled\\" fits perfectly where it is, and hardly needs a noticably different chorus than the verses--i guess when you have verses that beautiful, why change the feeling of the song?  \\"rescue blues\\", very good.  \\"nobody girl\\", weaker than the first 7, but this song is solid and you might not know how good it is until you hear the rest of the album. <br /> <br />\\"sylvia plath\\", painful.  thank god for skip button.  now you might be thinking that \\"enemy fire\\" sounds kinda good.  but that's only because you just heard \\"sylvia plath\\".  i admit, though, that \\"enemy fire\\" is ok.  \\"gonna make you love me\\" is the best of the last 8 songs and i would even say it might be better than ok.  next 3 songs, painful.  \\"tina toledo's street walkin blues\\" is actually not so bad.  \\"goodnight, hollywood blvd\\" has pretty good verses, but the chorus is painfully bad <br /> <br />overall, 5 stars
B000001F7R|4.0|Review no. 63. Had totally forgot all about this album, which was unleashed in 1980, as 'On Through The Night' was the band's first effort. Remember seeing them that summer as support for Ted Nugent and the Scorpions, and to this very day, I occasionally still hear people mentioning the event. Also remember that radio stations all over the U.S. were wearing out \\"Rock Brigade\\" and \\"Wasted\\". This is SO different than what the band is doing today. Other notable cuts here are the somewhat psych \\"Satellite\\" and the CD's two more pop like tracks \\"Hello America\\" and \\"Rocks Off\\". I've always considered Def Leppard to be good British heavy rock. Only thing I would recommend is that if you decide to purchase a copy of this title, do keep in mind that after like a dozen or less plays, it REALLY grows old. Nice to pull out from time to time for a spin.
B0007O38F8|5.0|50 cent released (arguably) the greatest hip-hop album of all time back in 2003 with Get Rich Or Die Trying. Beleive it or now, The Massacare is an instant classic. If you dont have this album, You are not a true MTV supporter and not a music fan. This is a classic album.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is one of my favorite albums of 2005. It's fun, catchy, and it's Madonna. Fom the moment I heard \\"Hung Up,\\" I was hooked.  <br /> <br />1. Hung Up 5/5 <br />2. Get Together 5/5 <br />3. Sorry 5/5 <br />4. Future Lovers 4/5 <br />5. I Love New York 4/5 <br />6. Let It Will Be 5/5 <br />7. Forbidden Love 4/5 <br />8. Jump 5/5 <br />9. How High 4/5 <br />10. Isacc 5/5 <br />11. Push 5/5 <br />12. Like It Or Not 5/5
B000BJS4OY|5.0|In my opinion, Born to Run is the greatest album ever made. It's been my personal favorite album ever since I bought it about 5 years ago. So buy this album and all of Springsteen's other albums.
B000003CMB|5.0|Rate is a wrong word when it comes to the best live rock album ever
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I don't want to write a long review so I'll just say it is great electro pop music.  Buy it and have a dance party...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna and her production team have put out what is clearly the album of her career. Outdoing \\"Music\\", \\"Like a Prayer\\" or any of her stronger work from the 1990s and 1980s, \\"Confessions..\\" is a brilliant nonstop homage to the history of dance music, with electro-synth heavy tracks reminsicent of Donna Summer, Kraftwerk, Irene Cara, New Order and early Madonna herself. With the absence of any filler whatsoever, \\"Confesions..\\" is a finely crafted dance-pop gem, and a fantastic transition from the more serious mood of \\"American Life.\\" With no weak tracks to speak of, \\"Hung Up\\" is definitely not an album stand out. That honor belongs to \\"Sorry\\", \\"Jump\\" and \\"Isaac.\\" With haunting background chanting, \\"Isaac\\" has a sound unlike any other track heard in recent years. \\"Forbidden Love\\" is another instant classic, with a crisp melody and ear shattering beat. But the song that makes this album worth buying on its very own, is \\"Let it Will Be\\". Thumping, pulsating, sorrowful and addictive all at the same time, this is pure unadultered Madonna. Just when you think this woman cannot get any better, she puts out an album with songs more fierce than anything out there today.
B000BI0WOA|4.0|For an overview of Mark Knopfler's career, this is great to have, or people who haven't listened to him since the days of Dire Straits that he's continued to put out music. A bulk of the collection is Dire Straits with a new song with Emmylou Harris at the end that's nice.  <br /> <br />I like this one better than the \\"Sultans of Swing\\" collection because I like \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" a lot.   <br /> <br />I'd advise anyone to pick up all of Dire Straits' studio CDs including \\"Alchemy\\" (which would make for a great CD/DVD combo), the BBC sessions, and \\"On the Night\\" which cover the various phases of their career.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Dark glamor and a beauty as clear and as fragile as a rose appear in the music of King Crimson's \\"The Power To Believe\\".  I feel as I listen to this work as if King Crimson has long since survived the fall of a thousand ages  and moved into a future age so remote it bares little resemblance to our own.  There is a sense of doom and psychological complexity so apparent in much of King Crimson's greatest music since long, long ago they led us into the Court of the Crimson King.  At moments I feel as if I woke in a city tens of thousands of years hence and I listen to the sounds of the city from a hotel room on a street whose name I cannot remember.  Past all bearings and all reckonings there is still a power to believe.    Why is it that King Crimson can combine age with such great vitality?  So many other rock acts long since have outlived their usefulness.  They become mere ghosts of what they once were while their legends beckon with a power that no longer exists to make music as equally great in the present.  Not so with the Crimson King.  They are the not-quite-icey survivors of rock music taking it into dimensions of feeling that shock and unsettle, creating a beauty that provokes unease.    It's a great pity that the corporate rock world celebrates guitarists like Hendrix or the Edge of U2 ( great guitarists, to be sure) in a delirium of rock orthodoxy while Robert Fripp is largely ignored.  Fripp cannot be controlled or classified.  He began doing things with the guitar at an early age that can only be called uncanny.  And now, thousands of years into a remote future he still does things with a guitar that can only be called uncanny.  There is a sound coming out of his guitar that fills the whole album with a sense that we might learn to live in a time of real legends walking this earth once again.
B000641ZA4|5.0|The videos start off from 1992's \\"We Can't Dance\\" CD back to \\"A Trick of the Tail\\", then 3 from the post Phil \\"Calling All Stations\\" (which are pretty good) to the reunion \\"Carpet Crawlers 1999\\". For those that had the 2 videos on VHS, this expands on it in a big way.   <br /> <br />Hearing the songs in surround (choice of Dolby or DTS) is a treat, at times some of the instruments come out, other times an ambient echo. Each video's title allows you to press it to see the single design and director info.  <br /> <br />The video quality is great overall. It sounds great, but in the case of \\"Land of Confusion\\", some of the audio that went along with it is missing. The \\"Trick of the Tail\\" to \\"Duke\\" promos are before MTV, and it shows why Genesis and Phil were played on MTV so much... it's because they were ahead of the game.   <br /> <br />Things I would have liked to have seen:  <br />-Commentaries by Phil, Anthony and Mike, at least on some of the videos.  <br />-\\"Making ofs\\" and outtakes and bloopers of the videos that may exist.  <br />-The 1 hour concert film they did in 1976-77 for theaters.  <br />-The biggest hole in the video collection has to be the Peter Gabriel material, which is scarce but out there: there is some footage of \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\", but there was a concert film from 1973 that has \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", \\"I Know What I Like\\" and the epic \\"Supper's Ready\\", as well as a BBC concert from the Nursery Cryme era.  <br /> <br />However, good news is that Phil Collins (who played drums with a Genesis tribute band called \\"The Musical Box\\" and played on the song with the same name), Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett have mentioned being in talks about a reunion and live archive tapes are being remastered.
B0002G2B2M|3.0|What a brainteaser! This movie was crafted very carefully, so don't be suprised if you spend the rest of the evening trying to figure it out! And when you do, it will certainly impact you.<br /><br />There are a number of things I really don't like about this movie, but I think it does bring out some very pertinent issues and raises a number of important questions. Some of them include: To what extent can the mind be tampered with? What role does manipulation play in relationships? How does easy access to technology change human relationships? Is there a difference between the \\"mind\\" and the physical \\"brain\\"? Is there any sort of consciousness that trancends the physical aspects of the brain? Are we comfortable enough with mind-altering technology to entrust the manipulation of our brain to a particular company or organization? Is there a distinction between reality and fantasy, existence and non-existence, and if so--how can we know it?<br /><br />In some ways this film is horror. Why? Because our society, technologically and ethically speaking is not on a much different level. We (society in general) lack a sufficient moral and ethical basis that would give us form (limitations) that would prevent the If-We-Can-Do-It-We-Will-Do attitude that is often prevelant in technological development. Freedom without form is an invitation to disaster. The question of whether X or Y or Z is harmful or immoral becomes a moot point when society has determined that something is in its reach and finds no sufficient basis in its worldview for moral absolutes. This film is a stark portrayal of this.<br /><br />One thing of note about this movie is that this is an atypical role for Jim Carey. He seems to fit into the role, though!
0684833395|3.0|Throughout most of the book Catch-22, I was left dazed and confused as to what was going on in the stroy. In fact, I have no idea what the real storyline is, but I can say this, having read the book; the author attempts to define the Catch-22 numerous times by telling stories of each of the characters lives, and how they try to achieve something, but they never seem to be able to get there, for one reason or another. Joseph Heller therefore proves the Catch-22 exists. but beyond this main point, I do not recognize any form of story developing. The whole story seemed to be going around in circles, and, if it wasnt for the humorous parts within the book every now and then, I may have put it down in utter confusion as to what was going on in the book. Without the humor, the book did not tie itself together, so, for the little that I did get from the book, I owe it to the humor.
B00005S6K8|4.0|Since I was comparing, it wasn't as good as it might be. The thing is Julia Ormond is totally not Audrey Hepburn and not even trying to be (good thing!). She did a good job. Harrison Ford I really disliked as Linnus, though I never totally liked Bogart's Linnus in the first place. Ford's Linnus was pretty good, but he just looked wrong! Ugh, I hated his glasses! This David wasn't as good as William Holden, who I thought was much smoother, but in the end I liked this David in his own right; he grew a bit, gained some character. I didn't like how he fell in love with Elizabeth Tyson (as in \\"this is it, Linnus\\"-pretty real type of falling in love), instead of liking her and Linnus totally arranging the marriage. Because it made it way worse for David to go for Sabrina and fall in love with her so quickly; it makes him REALLY shallow (of course, he is shallow, but this brings it too far). Really liked how Sabrina's change is SOOO radical. I didn't recognize her at ALL! WOW. Audrey's transformation wasn't THAT big (although how would you make her ugly?).
B000B8QEZG|5.0|First let me say this is much, much better release than her previous album. When got home i put into my X-box and began my first listen beyond the already immensly popular single \\"Hung Up\\". I was intrigued by what I heard, i couldnt finish a single song, i was too anxious to get to the next song. Then i plugged the entire album into my i-pod and have been playing it ever since over and over. It has a very Late Disco, early 80s music, (which is hard to notice at first, but it really does) But in each song one can also detect a futuristic feel to it, (a Future Disco of sorts) Mark my words: This will be the album to recon with in 2006!   by faves are    Sorry (my 3rd favorite)  Jump (my 2nd Favorite)  Isaac(my 1st favorite)    All in all, its a good Club/Dance Album.
B000BO0LLS|4.0|So we all know Mariah is back, and this CD is more enjoyable the second time around!! <br /> <br />\\"Don't Forget About Us\\" falls just short of \\"We Belong Together\\" but nonetheless, it's a hit. <br /> <br />\\"So Lonely\\". This song has been my favorite song since \\"The Day After\\" came out, and she makes it hot for the ladies on here, putting another one of her verses and cutting a Twista verse. I like it more then the original as of now, because it's new material, but although it's a great song, when i listen to it a couple more times, the one on Twista's CD will be more enjoyable for me. <br /> <br />\\"Makin It Last All Night (What It Do)\\" Cut the Jermaine Dupri. He ruined \\"It's Like That\\" and this sounds the same. She should do more with Twista, he delivers better beats. Although MILAN (WID) has a good beat, the song just doesn't do it for me. <br /> <br />\\"We Belong Together Remix\\". Good song, but how old is it? They should of gotten Da Brat and whoever else was in Don't Forget About Us remix together faster, and put that on here. That way it would have been all new material. <br /> <br />The Videos <br />This is great. You get Mariah's biggest hit to date \\"We Belong Together\\" video to keep, which is great. ALSO you will finally be able to put It's Like That and We Belong Together (which are supposed to have a part 1, part 2 effect) and see if it goes. \\"Shake It Off\\" was a good video, but I don't like the song. \\"Get Your Number\\". If for anything, buy this album for this. The limited edition will run out shortly, and no one will have this video, besides us that purchased it. It won't be anywhere else, will be worth money sometime. <br /> <br />Definetly purchase this, not Confessions On A Dance Floor. I was looking forward to that release, but after listening to it, it wasn't that great.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ok, I am not a big madonna fan but this album hooked me up because its electronic-progressive-house beats and sounds. The lyrics arent that deep but this isnt Gandhi, its a dance album. You will enjoy this cd a lot if you learn to feel the vibes on it and let your body & mind do the rest. Awesome engineer production, power beats and fun is what you get here. Try it if you like real music and you are open to something different, but dont bother if you are looking for trashy pop or R&B. This is madonna people, thats why this is different. Favorite tracks? Hang up, Sorry, Forbidden Love & Isacc. Just Wow. Enjoy!
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Anything new Madonna does manages to get a lot of attention, so when it was announced that she was returning to her roots in dance music it seemed that she couldn't go wrong this time. <br /> <br />The results are at best mixed, as usual there are some good things in her new record, and also some filler too. Here is my track by track review; <br /> <br />1 Hung Up -- Great lead off single that really kicks ass. This should be a #1 record!!  So far in the U.S. it seems to have peaked at #20, but as we know Billboard does not really take into account how well the single sells commercially - only airplay and they just ain't playin it. <br /> <br />2) Get Together -- Sounds like 1983 again.... not bad at all, just not to be taken seriously. <br /> <br />3) Sorry -- One of the best tracks on the album, decent lyrics and a nice hook. Radio ready.... <br /> <br />4) Future Lovers -- This could be the big hit!!  Reminds me of \\"Sky fits Heaven\\" and \\"Impressive Instant\\", but better and more satisfying. For radio though it could be tightened up a lot (more \\"I feel Love\\" Moroder music and less Madonna spoken lyrics.) When the song gets going it's  great, but it slows down when Madonna does her voice overs. <br /> <br />5) I love New York -- Junk. Should not have even been considered. <br /> <br />6) Let it will be -- Decent track and a heck of a lot better than track# 5. Could easily be remixed yet (and maybe sped up a bit) again for club play <br /> <br />7) Forbidden Love -- Nice beat, but still only a B-side. Could be reworked even more for club play. <br /> <br />8) Jump -- Kind of an electronica cousin to \\"Holiday\\" or \\"Where's the Party\\". Fun lightweight dance tune. <br /> <br />9) How High -- The most introspective song on the album, and a good one too. Madonna talks about herself and her celebrity to a very catchy beat, this will be a hugh hit in the clubs. Hopefully radio will pick up on this one. <br /> <br />10) Isaac -- Madonna \\"Kaballah style\\".... More filler, nothing for Rabbi's to get upset about.  <br /> <br />11) Push -- Very annoyning, repetitive chorus. one step above track# 5. <br /> <br />12) Like it or not -- song is set to a slower beat expaining who Madonna is and telling you that if you like her or not she's never going to stop.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'm sorry im not going to give Madonna's New album bad reviews because i have been a madonna fan ever sence the first album when i was young and i have to say this album is so hot i love the new style. My favorite songs are Hung Up, Get Together and Sorry. I love the whole album too. Madonna Keep up the good work.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Constantine is not a bad movie at all.When I saw the trailer for it i knew I had to see it.I had very high expectations for it.I just rented it last week and was not dissapointed but in a way I was.I thought it was going to be a little better than it turned out but it still isn't a bad movie.Don't pay alot of money for it but it is worth seeing.I give it 3 stars
0525948023|5.0|This is a book about getting to know me (you) in depth. I never knew how to do it before. It's all in here. If that is your quest this is the book for you. Regarding the critics, it's so easy to recognize in their comments, their pain bodies looking for food to strengthen their egos. If you are ready, look beyond the words in the book, look where they are pointing to, and you'll find what you are truly hungry for. If you are not ready, just put it aside. Don't bother with it. No drama. It's simple.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Since MTV leaked Madonna's upcoming \\"Confessions on a Dance floor\\" album, I was unable to stop listening to it! It is simply amazing and the best album to come from Madonna since 1998's \\"Ray of Light\\"! One thing is sure, die hard Madonna fans will undoubtedly be seduced by \\"Confessions\\", however having said that, other fans might want to be warned that none of the other tracks possess the same intensity and energy as \\"Hung Up\\" does. Though all are very upbeat, with a few mellow songs here and there, all have a very different individuality that goes beyond anything that Madonna has ever done before....indeed the whole album sounds very futuristic and ahead of its time....which is perhaps why it comes off as such a masterpiece. Pay particular attention to \\"Get Together\\", \\"Let it Will be\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"How High\\", \\"Push\\", \\"Like it or Not\\" and \\"Sorry\\" (the rumored 2nd single) as these are the most danceable and uplifting tracks...The most creative production on the whole album, in my opinion, is embodied by the song \\"Isaac\\", it is very reminiscent of \\"Frozen\\" (1998)....very spiritual and filled with beautiful, ambient energy.....(one of the many high points of \\"Confessions\\"!) The two tracks that I initially struggled with, but have since grown accustomed to are \\"Future Lovers\\" and \\"I Love New York\\"....for some reason they both came off sounding emotionless and kind of empty; they definitely deserve careful listening....after a bunch of listenings they do manage to make a satisfactory impression; anyhow the album would not feel complete without them....Based on all this, personally my favorites include \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Isaac\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Get Together\\" and of course \\"Hung Up\\".....give this album a try....you will not be disappointed!!!! ......  <br />P.S. I don't think any of the people who gave this album a brief and weak review really took the time to listen to it.... they probably despise Madonna because of her 20+ year music success... and the fact that she is still an excellent performer and artist.... ignore all the short reviews bashing Madonna.... this truly is an amazing album..... YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!
B0002O0CM0|2.0|Well after being a huge Doors fan for over 20 years, I finally got these 2 albums with this convenient \\"double album extravaganza\\".    <br /> <br />Well history speaks for itself.  After these two jewels, The Doors were rightfully and permanently closed.  To be fair, the albums weren't awful, they just weren't Doors albums.  The classic cheesy organ Doors sound is gone as is Jim's baritone voice.  In there place is an attempt to replicate every major musical sound from the early `70s.  The boys CAN play, but they come across more as a very talented cover band. <br /> <br />If I were to use these CD's to judge The Doors, I would quickly come to these conclusions: <br /> <br /> 1 - Jim Morrison wrote ALL the music (lyrics and instrumental!) <br /> 2 - Jim Morrison was keeper of `The Doors sound' <br /> 3 - Jim Morrison designed all of the cover art <br /> 4 - Jim Morrison dressed the band <br />  <br /> Now, I realize Jim was The Lizard King and could do most anything, but I really doubt he performed all of these tasks.  It's pretty obvious The Doors wanted a fresh start.  The track \\"Wandering Musician\\" basically says that, but too bad it sounds like a 80's Heavy Metal ballad.  Also interesting how Densmore sits off by himself on the cover of Other Voices.  Does he know of the up-and-coming legal problems with his bandmates ?  Or did he just leave a spot for Jim ?  Maybe they kept hoping he would show up and take his spot ?  Lord knows I wish he would have and performed his 4 duties mentioned above.   <br /> <br />If you really want a `new' post Morrison Doors song, check out `Under Waterfall' on 'Stoned Immaculate' -it at least sort of sounds like a Doors song. <br /> <br />Which brings up - Doors of the 21st Century/Riders on the Storm....  Why aren't they singing any of these great songs ?  Why aren't they building on this new sound ?  Its no wonder these albums don't even make the discography section on The Doors website.  Manzarek still complains about the OliverStone movie (and I can see why), but Ray should be thankful to Stone that these two turkeys weren't mentioned in the film ! <br /> <br />Not only had The Doors lose their singer, they had lost their way ! <br />
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton's extraordinary book THE BIOLOGY OF BELIEF is destined to revolutionize the way we think about the effects our  thoughts have on our bodies at the cellular level. Lipton writes with enthusiasm, warmth and passion about the role of the environment in regulating gene activity, with the authority of having had decades of published scientific papers which pre-date the official start of the brand new scientific field of epigenetics.<br /><br />Not only do our thoughts directly influence our health and well-being, but we are probably unable to heal or succeed without them. Lipton states, \\"The placebo effect should be the subject of major, funded research efforts. If medical researchers could figure out how to leverage the placebo effect, they would hand doctors an efficient, energy-based, side effect-free tool to treat disease.\\"<br /><br />THE BIOLOGY OF BELIEF really shines when describing the relevance of cutting-edge scientific findings to our daily lives. Lipton writes with such sparkling, down-to-Earth words that it's a real pleasure to take them fully and deeply to heart. And when we do, we can feel glad that the world will no longer be the same.
B00005JODA|4.0|\\"The constant gardener\\" is an extremely good movie that could have been exceptional but somehow doesn't reach that point. All the same, I think it is the kind of film you will appreciate, specially if you enjoy a good thriller, great actors, and the opportunity to watch the beautiful African scenery.<br /><br />The plot is based on a novel by John Le Carre, who said that \\"The constant gardener\\" is an excellent adaptation of his book of the same name, even though it is quite different from it. In my opinion, the director, Fernando Meirelles, should be recognized for doing an excellent job in what ended up being an outstanding (and thouroughly non-linear) film. Even though I didn't like this movie as much as I loved Meirelles' previous film, \\"City of God\\", it easy to see that he retains his gift for surprising the spectator, and treating him with scenes of astonishing beauty.<br /><br />The plot is, in general, the same of the book. Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), the main character, is an extremely polite English diplomat working in the British Embassy in Kenya. He who has only two passions in his life: gardening  and his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz). Tessa isn't overly conventional, and can be downright rude when she is defending one of her many causes, while Justin is taking care of his garden. Despite their differences, they complement each other. Justin, oblivious to the reality that surrounds him in Kenya, grounds himself in Tessa, and can't imagine his life without her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when some hired guns kill Tessa, Justin will have to learn if he will be able to live in a world without Tessa. His more immediate concern, however, is why was she killed. Justin's life is thrown into turmoil, and danger abounds, as he learns that Tessa was investigating the shady dealings of an important pharmaceutical company working in Kenya. But what did she discovered? Justin won't stop until he learns just that, finishing what his wife started.<br /><br />On the whole, I think I can recommend this movie as high-quality entertainment, fast-paced enough to engage even those who don't like \\"slow\\" films.  Heartily recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcatmovie as high-quality entertainment, fast-paced enough to engage even those who don't like \\"slow\\" films.  Heartily recommended!    Belen Alcat
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This is definately one of Madonna's most original studio albums. She's dabbled a little in each genre, including R&B, pure pop, techno, trance, and now on \\"Confessions\\" she takes on disco. Yeah, it seems odd at first, but then you're easily able to slip into this \\"future disco\\" genre that she's hyped for the past few months while working on this album.<br /><br />She said this is all dance, no ballads. Perhaps that's true, but I still felt like she slipped in a very trendy, likeable ballad or two. One of the most appealing and interesting things about this album is that all the tracks are mixed together. They're still seperated by track numbers but the music itself blends together so that there's never a pause or still moment while you're listening to the CD. Each track is also mixed to sound like it's been remixed. Instead of having one or two dull tracks that will turn into a hot remix later on, we have a CD full of tracks that have already been given a club-ready mixing.<br /><br />For those disapointed by \\"American Life,\\" I think you'll find that this is more appealing. It's fast paced, no techno-folk tracks. Mirwais, her producer for \\"Music\\" and \\"American Life,\\" only works with her on one track. Stuart Price (aka Thin White Duke) works with her on most of the others, but there are two contributions by Bloodshy and Avant, known for their work with Britney Spears' \\"Toxic\\" and \\"My Prerogative.\\"<br /><br />The songs are as a whole, great. A lot of them sample or borrow from other artists, such as the Jacksons, the Police, and Donna Summer. She even samples herself, making this not only a pop CD but sort of a showcase of the best in music during the past few decades. What makes this CD stand out as well is that if you listen closely, the tracks tell a story. It's what she attempted to do on \\"American Life,\\" but this time, there's a more dance spin on the music and she backs off on being so personal.<br /><br />The must hear tracks are the Abba sampled \\"Hung Up,\\" the mind-boggling \\"Sorry,\\" the follow up to her old 80s song \\"Keep it Together\\" titled \\"Jump,\\" the sassy \\"How High\\" and then the best track on the album, in my opinion, \\"Push\\" which is about love and what makes a great relationship. The other tracks are good, but sort of take away from the strength of the album in some way. \\"Future Lovers\\" is weak on lyrics, \\"Isaac\\" sounds like a lost remixed Kaballah track from \\"Ray of Light\\", and the other tracks may have a great beat but they lack thoughtful, stand-out lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" is definately up there on the level of \\"Music\\" and perhaps \\"Ray of Light\\" in that there's nothing like it out there today. It takes on the subject of love like \\"Erotica,\\" it talks about relationships like \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" and it criticizes and challenges fame and fortune like \\"American Life.\\" What it does best though is that it takes you on a journey through music. If you like rap, disco, R&B or even mindless pop, this will satisfy your thirst. Each song may not be something to remember, but this CD as a whole is Madonna returning to her '80s roots and just encourages you to dance with a little push and inspiration from some great to decent music.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|GREAT ALBUM...whats all the mariah carey fans doing here,,,i think they see the threat and the facts!!!!  how sad they are,,,desperate to validate their icon by trashing another ,i guess that sums up their fan base,,,anyways,,,this cd is GREAT --MADONNA proves once again why she is the QUEEN OF POP not just in the USA but the world over...one listen and at one point or another each and every track will be one of your favorites ALL HAIL QUEEN MADONNA!!!  mariah WHO?????
B000BO0LLS|4.0|If you get the re-release, get more bang for your buck buying this version. Yeah, even with the other you'll get the bonus tracks of \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"Making it Last\\", \\"So Lonely (One and Only pt. 2), and the remix to \\"We Belong Together.\\" Yet, with this version, you also get a bonus DVD with the music videos for \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Shake it Off\\", and the European single \\"Get Your Number\\".<br /><br />We've all, at this point, read the reviews of Mariah's \\"E of M\\" so I'll sum it up as being a great departure from her previous releases. There's something in the tracks that everyone in some way can relate to and connect with, which is why I think the CD has done so well. As for the new tracks, \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is a great song, \\"Making it Last\\" is okay, sort of like a continuation (in theme) of \\"Get Your Number\\" and it features Jermaine Dupri. \\"So Lonely\\" is good, but the version on Twista's CD is much better and still gives Mariah equal spotlight time. The \\"We Belong Together\\" remix is okay, but it's nothing close to the level of how good some of her past remixes have been.<br /><br />A great CD still, wonderful art work with the booklet, decent packaging. This would be a great christmas gift or something to complete your Mariah collection. You won't be disapointed, but get this version that comes with the DVD. It's only a few dollars more than the version without and it's definately worth your money and listening time.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|Sure....a-ha had some sound issues at Live 8, but I think they should have been included on this DVD.  They are still loved by all of their fans worldwide. That was a great disappointment to me.  With that said,I think this DVD is a great \\"stamp\\" for the world to see and to show what great \\"power\\" music has on everyone....every generation. Let music bring the world together in fighting poverty across the globe.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Isaac <br />Push and Hung Up are good..The rest, especially I Love N.Y are very bad songs..very similar sounding and not original at all!!
B00025ETIW|5.0|When I first heard these guys, it was \\"The Ghost of You\\" and I was watching FUSE, so I was watching the music video. I seriously almost cried, and I'm a guy. The video is set during World War II and shows the American Army Rangers headed for Point du Hoc (I'm a World War II buff) with the band on the Higgins Boat. The song goes so perfectly with the video its almost worthy of an Oscar. After I saw it, I went and listened to a bunch of their other songs and I fell in love with them. You NEED to listen to My Chemical Romance, especially \\"The Ghost of You\\", it is an amazing song and My Chemical Romance is an amazing band. Gerard Way is a powerful vocalist and he puts so much heart into what he sings its like he's pouring his soul out to you. GET THIS ALBUM!!!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|If you want REAL Music, go buy Jennifer Lopez's album right here at Amazon.com
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Think you have heard the best of Mariah with The Emancipation Of Mimi? Think again!  This re-release has four brand new tracks.  The first one is the incredible ballad \\"Dont Forget About Us\\".  She goes back to the basics in this song.  It sounds like something she would've released back in the early 90's.  Very soulful and an incredible beat.  \\"Makin' It Last All Night\\" is a club hit.  It sorta reminds me of a mix of It's Like That and \\"He Wasnt Man Enough\\" by Toni Braxton.  Its Hot!  My favorite is \\"So Lonely\\" (One and Only Part 2).  This is my song! It is sooooooo HOTT!!  I love it.  I would buy the entire album for this song alone if I had to.  I hope this is the next single.  I love the rap she does at the beginning.  And the remix to \\"We Belong Together\\" is good too.  I have heard it on the radio a while back though.  If you havent been EMANCIPATED yet, now is the time.  Expect BIG things at the Grammys from this album.  The music videos are all HOT too.  Especially \\"GEt Your Number\\".
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Being that I am a long time Madonna fan, I wasn't impressed at all.  Maybe it's because I am not a big techno fan, but to me all the songs sounded the same, just differnt words.  Her 80's and early 90's music was so much better!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|First of all,dont let the lamb jerks that wrote all the inaccurate reviews of this cd fool you!  \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" is the Madonna cd we've been waiting for! 12 new dance anthems that will have you on the floor feeling great!  <br />Gone is the political drama of \\"American Life\\" this new cd offers non stop fun! Remember the days of \\"dress you up\\" \\"angel\\" and \\"open your heart\\"? Its all here folks but in 1978 meets 2005 form! Lead off jam \\"hung up\\" along with  \\"get together\\" \\"sorry\\" and \\"jump\\" are the standouts! pure dance bliss! \\"i love new york\\" is pure techno magic! \\"how high\\" \\"push\\" and \\"let it will be\\" is a little deeper dance,but you will be singing along to these within minutes! Madonna tells us at the end \\"like it or not\\" to take her for what she is...groundbreaking,brazen,talented,and yes a bit silly! \\"C.O.A.D.\\" is madonna at her best! if you liked \\"Ray of Light\\" you will be blown away by this gem! WELL DONE MADONNA! A+
B000B8QEZG|5.0|HUNG UP: 7/10  <br />Well well, it's quite repetitive.. actually I think it's quite different from the rest of the album, I still like it cause it's catchy, but it wasn't the best choice for a single. I like the instrumental bridge though..  <br /> <br />GET TOGETHER: 9/10  <br />It cries 'SINGLE!' It's amazing... that beat.. out of this world.. very futuristic as Price said.. This is what I call XXIst century music! It's catchy but without losing that touch of ecstasy, extraterrestrial trance..  <br /> <br />SORRY: 7.5/10  <br />First of all, I don't think it's a good choice for a single.. the song is catchy but not the kind of club-classic people are expecting from madge.. I does even sound like a britney song..  Too standard.. and repetitive..  <br /> <br />FUTURE LOVERS: 8.5/10  <br />Way to go Mirwais!! This song sounds like a ROL leftout... which I absolutely adore!! It's a pity the intro is so long.... but I really like the development of the melody.. Not too futuristic cause it's a 'been there seen that' song. But what the hell, that was what we wanted didn't we?  <br />(but forget it as a single)  <br /> <br />I LOVE NEW YORK: 5/10  <br />  euk.. I hope this is not released as a single cause the album will sink.. Apart from the song being so  , her voice ain't better.. Well, don't have much to say about this one.. just 'you can skip it'  <br /> <br />LET IT WILL BE: 8/10  <br />This is a good one. When the beat starts you can't help shouting \\"funkytown!' Remember Shrek? I really like the retro feeling mixed with the new sound.-. what was being preached.. One regret I have about this one is that I would have told her to sing it on a higher key.. well, actually the same applies to most of the songs..  <br /> <br />FORBIDDEN LOVE: 8/10  <br />Good melody, though I don't like her voice sounding so robotic. It also has an 80s/70s feeling, which fits extremely well with the strings in the background. I really like the 'once upon a time there was a boy' part  <br/> <br />JUMP: 7.5/10  <br />Sh**, again the key is too low.. but the song is quite good.. very kylie minogue.. also quite reminiscent of her 80s dance anthems...  <br /> <br />HOW HIGH: 7/10  <br />Scarily, the beginning is too britney-like. Luckily the song belts out really swiftily.. but there's always that britney sound.. Probably a filler, but not a bad one.  <br /> <br />ISAAC: 8/10  <br />Ok, the controversial one. Yeah man, it's weird-sounding. I don't know if i'm liking that buda thing (or whatever it is) going on. Probably without that guy singing the song would be more credible, something like a the succesor to 'frozen' (you can't avoid noticing the analogy). But I have to admit I enjoy listening to it  <br /> <br />PUSH: 3/10  <br />What is this? totally out of place.. It has nothing to do with the rest of the album.. it sounds like a gwen stefani plagiarism... well, that if you don't count the lyrics copy-pasted from sting's 'every breath you take'. lol, I think I made it clear. i don't like this one. Oh and one last wish: please don't make this one a single..  <br /> <br />LIKE IT OR NOT: 10/10  <br />It's the jewel of COADF.. wow.. the best of them all.. love the guitar, love the beat, the orchestra, the melody, it's infectious, slow yet danceable, catchy yet dark... Probably it sounds like a song from the 'MUSIC' album, the quality up there with don't tell me..  <br />
B00005JO1S|4.0|Danny (Jonah Bobo), seven years old, and Walter (Josh Hutcherson), ten, are left in the care of their older sister, Lisa (Kirsten Stewart). Dad (Tim Robbins) asks her to keep an eye on them as he runs to the office to pick up something for an upcoming meeting.  Being the teenager she is, she promptly goes back to sleep. Walter wants to watch baseball on TV, avoiding his younger brother. When Danny proves to be too much of a pest, Walter chases him throughout the house. He finds Danny hiding in the old dumb waiter and lowers him into the basement. Danny finds his way to the stairs and notices an old board game hiding between the wooden steps. \\"Zathura, a Space Adventure for Two Players\\". Danny excitedly shows the game to Walter who ignores him. Danny opens the box and turns the key on the board, causing a button to pop out. He presses the button. His spaceship is moved mechanically across the board. A card pops out. It reads \\"Meteor Shower. Take Evasive Action.\\" Danny can't read the card and shows Walter. Walter looks at the card and explains what it means just as meteors begin to destroy the living room. They soon realize that their house is floating in outer space. The only way home? To complete the game.<br /><br />\\"Zathura\\", directed by Jon Favreau (\\"Elf\\", \\"Made\\", \\"Swingers\\"), is based on a Chris Van Allsburg book, the same children's book author behind \\"Jumanji\\" and \\"The Polar Express\\".<br /><br />A well-crafted film suitable for the whole family, \\"Zathura\\" is a delight.<br /><br />The story is involving and interesting and effectively brings us into the lives of these children. As Danny and Walter run around the house, getting on each others nerves, they seem entirely realistic; two young boys, stuck inside, bored, on a Saturday afternoon. What else would they do except annoy each other, get into mischief and make various attempts to play together? As soon as they find the game, the story really kicks into gear. They realize that they have to play the game through to the end, to get their house back to its small lot in Pasadena and for everything to return to normal. As they play the game, they realize that they have to work together to overcome the challenges of Zathura.<br /><br />\\"Jumanji\\" had a similar premise, but \\"Zathura\\" is a very different film. The first film seemed overflowing with characters and animals. \\"Zathura\\" takes a different approach, telling the story of the two brothers and a couple of visitors who help out through the course of the story. Because of this, \\"Zathura\\" seems more manageable, more intimate. The first film had Robin Williams' antics, but this new film seems better, more enjoyable, more like a real adventure.<br /><br />Each card popping out of the machine signals the beginning of a new part of the adventure, a new challenge. Some of these put the two boys in dangerous situations that only strengthen the bond between them, others provide some comic relief. An early card reads \\"Player enters cryogenic sleep chamber. For next five turns.\\" Lisa (Stewart), still not realizing that the house is floating through space walks into her bathroom, concerned that she will be late for her date, and instantly freezes solid. The two boys don't know what to do, except to keep her safe until that action has expired. Another card reads \\"Rescue Abandoned Astronaut\\". At that very moment, an astronaut (Dax Shepard, TV's \\"Punked\\") flies by the front door. After they rescue him, he proves particularly useful during the remaining challenges.<br /><br />When you were a kid, you most likely played games or with toys, imagining they were real and you were actually interacting with them. \\"Zathura\\" brilliantly captures this feeling, taking it to a new level. Two little boys who were playing a real board game would probably interact in the same way. If one of the players started imagining something a little scary, the other would either encourage him to keep going, to become stronger, or help him through the challenge.The two brothers do this throughout. As various parts of the house are demolished by a robot, heat seeking aliens, and meteors, they scramble to keep the board game, their ticket home, intact.<br /><br />Director Jon Favreau does a great job at the helm. From the beautiful house, a million plus dollar Arts and Crafts home that dad (Robbins) says he is fixing up, to the look and feel of the board game, Favreau has a definite and unique style. Much like in \\"Elf\\", Favreau likes everything to seem a little retro. In \\"Zathura\\", the board game graphics and design appear to have been plucked out of the Fifties. A robot, looking more like something from \\"Forbidden Planet\\" than \\"Star Wars Episode III\\", makes an appearance. It actually looks like some of the special effects were created the old fashioned way, with models and miniature, rather than excessive CGI, lending the film a charm many parents should appreciate.<br /><br />Favreau also does a nice job with the actors. The two brothers are great. Funny and entirely believable, they could live in any house on your street. Kirsten Stewart is also very funny as Lisa, the typical teenage girl. And Dax Stewart does a nice job as the slightly charismatic astronaut.<br /><br />\\"Zathura\\" is that rare live action film good for the entire family. Kids will love it and adults will enjoy watching it. A couple of the scenes are probably too scary for some of the youngest children. Children Danny's age, under 7, will probably find the film too scary. But everyone else should have a great time playing \\"Zathura\\".challenge. The two brothers do this throughout.

B000002B2T|5.0|<br />This is an excellent album which is well worth hearing for any rock/alternative music fan and particularly for Alice In Chains/Layne Staley fans. This is essentially Layne Staley's solo album, accompanied by some fairly famous grunge rock friends. These sort of supergroup albums more often than not are a disappointment but this one is a notable exception. <br /> <br />Some obvious influences can be heard in this album, the excellent opening track 'Wake Up', which somehow reminds me of Deep Purple's 'child in time' , whilst 'Lifeless Dead' has a sabbath-influenced riff thrown.  <br />This record has a sound that is very much its own, quite laid back despite its heavier moments. Layne Staley makes it his record though, since his vocals are superb throughout and there seems a real chemistry between the members of this band. <br /> <br />Interesting to note that I also ordered 'temple of the dog' the PaerlJam/Sounndgarden-based tribute to Andrew Wood of MotherLoveBone. This is a well reviewed CD but so far I've not got into it anything like as much as I have this album, 'Above' <br />I shall give it time, it seems 'temple of the dog isn't as immediate, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend 'Above'. <br />Pity this turned out to be Mad Season's only album together. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is her best album since Erotica. Others say Ray of Light (which was great), but that's up for discussion. Every song is either very good or excellent. The only song I don't feel is How High. <br /> <br />Madonna has alway been a club favorite. Has more number one club hits than any other artist, so it was only logical to make an album for the clubs. These songs also have the potential to have great remixes unlike American Life. U.S. radio is not embracing her new album. Hung Up preaked at #20, but else where in the world it has topped the charts. All the other songs don't fit well to the Top 40 format, which is fine because radio stinks.  <br /> <br />I believe those disappointed by American Life will embrace Confessions on a Dance Floor and forgive the last album. <br /> <br />Top Tracks: <br /> Hung Up <br /> Sorry <br /> Future Lovers (Think Donna Summer's I FEEL LOVE) <br /> I Love NY <br /> Love it will Be <br /> Isaac <br /> Like it or Not  <br /> <br />It's between 4 1/2 stars and 5.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is by far the best album of the year.  It is so amazing!  There is not a track on here that I skip!  The tracks I think stand out the most are \\"Like it or Not,\\" \\"Issac,\\" \\"Push,\\" \\"How High,\\" \\"I Love New York\\" and \\"Sorry!\\"  I think anyone who likes up beat music will love this album more than anything they have bought this year!  Madonna you are awesome!  Keep making great music!
B00005RY7X|5.0|this is not just a \\"party cd\\" <br /> <br />yeah, it mentions parties in a few of the songs, but you once you understand the Andrew W.K. persona, you understand that it just doesn't apply to parties, it applies to life <br /> <br />this cd has certainly changed the way i look at things <br /> <br />positive music with an upbeat metallish-punkish-synthish-pianoish overbeat <br /> <br />i can't explain the joy of owning this cd <br /> <br />i myself have three copies of it, purchasing each one more exciting than the last <br /> <br />life is the party!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After give this album a few listens, I am totally addicted to all the music. There are no gaps on this album (each track connects with each other), and definitely ALL-DANCE tracks! The first single \\"Hung up\\" already hits #01 in many countries. Although this album contains 70\\"s & 80\\"s melody, I think this album is one of her best.  <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Forbidden Love\\" - is different than the other songs, it has a Daft-Punk-ish feel inside of it. I love the uniqueness of her voice on this song, and the arrangement of the tunes. \\"Sorry\\" is catchier than the first single, and it's already penned to be the second single. \\"How High\\" - it sounds a bit computerized, but really, it rocks... I also love \\"I Love New York\\" - definitely a New York anthem, it's a dancable club tunes that won't be forgotten. I also love some other songs such as \\"Future Lovers\\", \\"Push\\" (reminds me of \\"Why is it so hard? from her \\"Erotica\\" album) - sounds so electronic, looks like she's been inspired by GOldfrapp on this song. And also not forget to mention the song \\"Isaac\\" - I love that song a lot, it has a middle-eastern feel inside of it, and the voice of the guy totally rocks, and sexy. Great combination of middle-eastern tunes, very upbeat and of course, I think it's a reminicent of her Ray Of Light era. <br /> <br />Overall buy this album, you won't regret it. Although \\"American Life\\" only sold for about 5 million copies and considered to be her weakest album, I think that album has shown a good way of sharing artisticity. I love the way she gave important messages towards her song. But if you're looking to have a DANCABLE CD, you won't regret having this - This album is definitely worth-it for a club anthem. I'm ready to dance whenever I listen to this album. Love this =D
B0000TLA9G|2.0|How can You assume career of band like GN'R in 14 songs? Well, for Me it's impossible. That's why I bash this compilation. Don't buy it even if You're a new fan. What You got here is the band BIGGEST (but not exactly the very best) hits, and a few interesting covers. But c'mon, Gunners have A LOT of great stuff!    If You want to hear GN'R, get the albums - all of their studio work is awesome.     Some things here just can't be spared - only 3 songs from AFD?? Oh, man. no. This album is one of the best of all time - those 3 songs do not represent it well. At least \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"Nighttrain\\", one of my favourite songs ever by GN'R, \\"Rocket Queen\\"... where are they?    You also get only one song from the underrated GN'R Lies - Patience. While it is awesome song, I would also pick up classic acoustic version of \\"You're Crazy\\" and wild \\"Reckless Life\\" as a touch of Gunners roots.     Songs from Illusions are ok - but where is Estranged? Another masterpiece, one of my beloved songs by GN'R?     At the end, 5 of 14 songs are covers - and why? Do we really need \\"Ain't It Fun\\" or \\"Live And Let Die\\" here? They are great songs, but would it not be better to replace those ones with original GN'R tunes, like mentioned above \\"You're Crazy\\" or \\"Estranged\\"?    Don't waste Your money on this - buy any of their studio albums and play it loud - Guns & Roses rock! This compilation sucks!
B0000TLA9G|1.0|November rain is a nive ballad, but I just am not into today,s muxic other than contempory christian.  If you want really good music and vocals the Beatles are the best. GodBless
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After just one listen to  Madonna's Confessions.. I WAS BLOWN AWAY !! Not a single average song can be found on this album !! it's simply UP with her best work to-date.<br /><br />From \\"Hung Up\\" to \\"Sorry\\" passing through \\"Let It Will Be\\" and \\"Jump\\" and ending it with \\"Like It Or Not\\", This album is definately a Masterpiece by all means<br /><br />it's a mixture btween her Dance tunes with the boldiness and deepness of Works ala \\"Ray Of Light\\"<br /><br />P.S: As most of you can notice, most bad reviews are submitted by Mariah Carey's fans.. That should explain the \\"1\\" Star ratings.. They must've mistaken this page with Mimi's album page, which should've get their ratings..
B000000XB9|4.0|I simply do not know personaly about the individuals of the Band but they have alot of good quality songs that simply puts todays music to shame, because today,s music other than Contempory Christian music is just terrible and alot of times just plain old noise. GodBless
B00005AQE8|5.0|If you are a true fan of hip hop, you cannot dispute that this is if not the greatest, then certainly one of the greatest albums ever made. Every track is layed out with a dope beat and lyrical flow which cannot be compared. Unfortunately the albums produced since 2pac's death have lost credit and meaning due to their production. It is hard to believe that a 2pac album could be hard to listen too, with eminem's input to loyal to the game he made it possible. To include people like 50 cent and other g-unit goons is insulting to true 2pac fans, 2pac himself im sure would be turning in his grave. <br /> <br />You could easily play all 27 songs on this cd without skiping a single track. A must have cd for hip hop lovers <br /> <br />standout tracks: <br /> <br />all about u <br />how do u want it <br />2 of amerikaz most wanted <br />holla at me <br />heaven aint hard 2 find
B00000ILGL|5.0|This album is absolutely incredible! It not only paves the way for Moroder's fame as a composer of anthems, it's also more trance-like than most of the stuff that passes for trance these days! You gotta get this!
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Madonna's career died w/ Ray of Light..She should definitely RETIRE her brittle bones! and go live in the English Country-Side..
B000B8QEZG|5.0|So, I'm really enjoying this album.  It's not without its flaws; however, it gets 5 stars because it's something that doesn't otherwise exist in the pop music marketplace.  There are no other good dance-pop albums out, let alone good dance tracks on ths radio, which means this album really stands out from the rest for being a unique listen.  Further, kudos to Madonna for making an all-dance album (something that she should have done long ago and should consider doing more frequently, in my opinion.)  I've been listening to it on repeat and I think it's great.  A much better listen than American Life and Music... maybe better than Ray of Light, if only because it's a much more fun listen.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I cannot think of a better album by a female Artisit this year!!The songs are terriffic..Bravo MC..Move over Madonna, your time is long done, Mariah is the New Queen of Pop/R&B
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" is not just another 'dance' record.  Madonna definately puts a twist on everything, however this time she leaves out any political points of view.  This album really does bring Madonna full circle, and makes me question, \\"what's next?\\"
B000B8QEZG|5.0|We all know Madonna.<br /><br />We are used to her sudden change of styles along with her ability to be ahead of times and always be the first to do something sooner or later every other pop star will be doing.<br /><br />And another great thing about her is that she is always doing something she never did... and even if she has already done something... somehow it does not look like like the same.<br /><br />Also, one of her best assets is the way she does not take herself too seriously... being able to laugh (and sometimes destroy) of the pop royalty status she enjoys.<br /><br />CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR is a great album for two reasons...<br /><br />FIRST because the songs are great examples of well produced dance tracks. \\"Hung Up\\" is a simply great. Catchy, melodic, contagiating everyone who listens to it. It also contains (as everybody knows) a sample of ABBA's Gimme Gimme Gimme in what seems to be one of the best examples of a good use of the sampling. Again, Madonna is doing something everybody does... but not quite like her.<br /><br />The tracks that follow just continue the mood: dance, have a good time, forget about serious issues or themes... just feel the music and go with the flow.<br /><br />And actually, all the tracks have a nice positive vibe to them.<br /><br />I loved \\"Get together\\", \\"I Love New York\\", \\"Sorry\\" and... \\"Like it or Not\\" is a the best track (and the best way to close the whole thing.<br /><br />SECOND, because the influences here are too many to name... from disco to techno to electronic to cool electronic... Madonna sums up beautifully what dance music has been for the last 25 years.<br /><br />In a way, Madonna is more mature and she knows there is nothing left to be prooved. She just set for a dance album, surrounded herself with the best talent around (as she always does) and from then on, you can be sure we have the best pop album we can get.<br /><br />As the Amazon editorial review said, this tastes like a guilty pleasure... but pleasures are Madonna's speciality.<br /><br />And here she delivers them in spades! This is a major point in a career full of major points.guilty pleasure... but pleasures are Madonna's speciality.  <br /> <br />And here she delivers them in spades! This is a major point in a career full of major points. <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|This isn't music, this is a product. It tries to sell itself with cheap commercial tactics/lyrics, and it isn't worth a minute of your time. 50 cent is an insult to the word \\"musician\\", \\"artist\\" or anything or the sort. I don't even got to have good taste to hate this. <br />
B000BBOUU4|5.0|First of all, to those who look at this as being \\"scary\\" or too \\"Michael Jackson\\" or too \\"unlike the original\\": be more open-minded!!! I have also seen the Gene Wilder/Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory, and the thing is, you can't compare the two! They were made at different times with different actors and different tools and technology. Secondly, Mr. Dahl was against the storyline for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory, which was why the movie was titled as such. I watched both, and then bought the book, which I am more than halfway reading through. According to the book, Tim Burton has stuck more to Dahl's story than the director of what everyone else is calling \\"the original.\\" Third, I also half-expected, with Burton directing the movie to have a darkness and unique imagination to it, as well. The fact that Wonka has stayed inside his factory for 15 years explains the pale skin, and the original illustrations from the book explain the hair. The only thing they could have done with Depp is have him grow a chin goatee, which the book describes Wonka as having. Wonka is not known for his affection of kids, especially bratty ones like in the movie, except of course Charlie. Michael Jackson has nothing to do with it!!! I did find some parts dull, but for the most part view this movie as entertaining and enjoyable. I'm sure if they did a remake of the Wizard of Oz, everyone would go berserk and hack it all to bits, as well, no matter how good it is! Read the book, watch both movies, have an open mind, and enjoy the story.
0375805613|5.0|I read this book to my nephew when he was 3, and he loved it.<br /><br />I had to read this book over and over to him.  He memorized the book and started reading it to me.<br /><br />This book is very cute and adorable and a great read for a child at any age.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Well I have been buying every season of Friends as it came out. I even have the favorite only DVD's and the final episode on DVD. So I was a little disappointed when I found out they were doing a box set with what I think is a really cool box. I thought of getting it anyway and trying to sell my old ones, but I figured I would lose money that way.  <br />So when I went to the store today and bought season ten, imagine my happiness when I found a coupon inside to buy just the box for $20(with s/h) <br />So I just thought I would share that with anyone else who may have wanted the box. Seems like a great deal to me!
B0008F113W|4.0|First i have to admit i'm not a big \\"techno\\" fan, but this album is very good!  I got the 25th aniversary edition with the bonus disc \\"remanufacture\\" that may be a little much for me.  As far as DEMANUFACTURE goes i am really impressed!  I may have to look into some more FF albums...
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Dance music this is NOT..It is a big Mess..The songs I like are Isaac and Hung Up..although I prefer ABBA 's GIMME,GIMME,GIMME...what a shame...she was good in the 80's
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I've wanted Madonna to release a new album for years and I'm so happy that it's finally here!!  \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is sort of like a follow-up to 1987's \\"You Can Dance\\".  One full hour of non-stop dance music from beginning to end.  The album starts off with \\"Hung Up\\", the fabulous first single which samples \\"Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie\\" by ABBA.  She also samples The Jacksons' bassline from \\"Can You Feel It\\" in \\"Sorry\\".  And we even have a very Donna Summer-esque feeling from \\"Future Lovers\\".  It's even got three other great songs: \\"Push\\" (a love song for her husband Guy Ritchie), \\"Like It or Not\\", and (my personal favorite) \\"I Love New York\\".  It's a non-stop, contagious, updated disco album by the one-and-only Madonna!!  Buy it, c'mon!!  Time goes by so slowly for those who wait, no time to hesitate!!!
B0002S94OS|5.0|You people know nothing of metal so go back and listen to your Ashlee Simpsons and Good Charlottes of the world because this music would scare you S--tless because you taste maybe consist of Mtv friendly material that you need to buy kids bops because the original \\"artists\\" scare you. This band and all their albums are true metal material, great twin guitarrists, killer bass, heart pounding drumming and angry charismatic vocals. All songs have a meaning from religion to the war in Iraq and they make no apologies either, even though they are in a high rate label. Best tracks here to look for are Laid to rest and Now you got something to die for but this is no filler album in any way. If you are a fan of groups like Slayer, Pantera and Metallica pick this up or even if you want to get into metal but dont know where to start pick this up and put this into your collection. P.S to a reviewer that said this mainstream rock tell me, does mtv play them and do you see clearchannel play them non stop in the radio? Answer is no because they are too afraid to touch this. And to the guy above who like Ashlee Simpson, I like classical music too, some of my fondest memories involved hearing my grandfather play violin and guitar which later taught me to play, but how can you come to defend Ashlee,1. she livesunder her sisters shadow and only shoved down our throats because her dad manages her, Jessics and her boyfriend,2. She can't sing,period(SNL) And so maybe metal singer don't have beuatiful voices, it is the anger that is the focul point to metal, and for good vocalists try Iron Maiden System Of a Down Metallica Tool Dream Theater and Alice in Chains for true metal singers that can show off Ashlee Simpson.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I am veryhappy Mariah released this new version..I waited to buy this album and now I am happy that I Did Wait..Great C.D
B000B8QEZG|5.0|So tell me why exactly this is such a waste of money when it has been the top selling CD on Amazon... and that was 12 days b4 the disc actually dropped? <br />Tell me why anyone would want to spend money on an album that was released once... was successful... and then released again in an attempt to take MORE money from their L.A.M.B.s... i mean fans? What for a few more songs that soung like the rest of the album? Shake it off! <br />-The laws of capitalism are, the proprietor of goods can set any price that he or she sees fit and shall not be at the mercy of any MORAL or ETHICAL issues. <br /> <br />\\"Confessions\\" is SO what the music industry needed right now. Fun, guilty pleasure music that speaks to the soul as well as to the body! Thank you Madonna for this! Thank you for saving us from dour gloomy rock ballads and sappy wanna be soul! <br />\\"How high are the stakes... how much fortune can we make?\\" <br />I dunno but i know that i am encouraging everyone to go out, purchase this work of art, and squash that crazy butterfly before she calls Eminem again!
B000B8QEZG|2.0|There is One good song on this c.d and that is Hung Up..and maybe Sorry is alright, but this sounds very dated, like really bad 80's cheese..save your mony folks... <br />Reccommended Instead of this washed-up trash: <br />carrie Underwood-One Heart <br />Kate Bush-Aerial <br />mariah Carey--Ultra Platinum Edition of Mimi
0740748475|5.0|Love Calvin, love Hobbes. I recommend this edition. It has everything. <br /> <br />The only issue, it is very heavy. Also, because of the price, I'm a little scare to tear it everytime I open one of the books.These are not for sure bathroom reading :O)
B000B8QEZG|2.0|This C.D is Horrible! she should be executed for shamelessly using An ABBA sample as heavily as she does..shame Madonna..You really dont have anymore tricks up yopur sleeve anymore do you???Hung Up is the only standout track..
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I dont expect profound music from Madonna and she's made some truly great dance tunes in the last 2 decades.  What's strange about this CD is how this \\"dance album\\" almost completely misses the mark as a dance album.   <br /> <br />Hung Up is catchy enough but the other tracks go downhill fast.  The thing is -- all of these tracks could have been better with a different production of them.  What we get is too treble-heavy electronic beats and an almost complete lack of lyrical \\"hooks\\" to draw you into the songs. <br /> <br />Really misses the mark. <br />
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Unless you REALLY like (you must be crazy if you do) such lyric GEMS (yeah, right) like \\"Them chickens <br />is ash and I'm lotion Baby come and get it\\" <br /> <br />Don't buy it not even if it's the last thing you do on your life. But J'Lo instead.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Well there was a Mariah Carey tour...i dont think somebody heard of it...dream people mariah cannot even shake her huge bally...is she really a whole model for children after what she did on TRL!!! She was not able to sold out one single night in Milan was her last tour a success?? While Madonna sold out hers in less than hours... <br />Madonna's new album is one of her best work up to date, takes you to another level, instead of making you cry because we belong together...ewwwwww <br />Madonna RULES!!!!!!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|What is up with this?  What a rip off!
B0006J28KU|5.0|I love how DeNiro gets caught reading a book called \\"Stress Fractures in Titanium\\" by that (she) which ultimately breaks him.<br /><br />We might say he's reading a biography of himself.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|There seem to be a lot of false reviews going on, don't listen to the negative people.  It is obvious they have never heard the album.  Madonna seems to bring out the jeliously in a lot of people.  Yes she is better than every artist out there but thats no reason to get all bitter.  Just go with the flow.  Anyway, this album is a stand out in dance music history.  Each track is single worthy and amazing.  GET TOGETHER recalls early Madonna, with it's happy go lucky beat and lyrics this track is sure to you move and sing along. The album is not all fast pace beats, one track PUSH does take us down to about 120bpm to more of an R&B beat, and the hook on this one is off the wall.  Just trust me go out and get this album, you will not regret it!  A++ <br />If you only own one Madonna album this is the one to own!
B0000027RL|4.0|First off, I would like to mention that the disgusting psychopath who pointed out that everyone who listens to Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Rage Against The Machine is Satanic and Anti-Christ is NOT Mormon. In one of his other reviews he even mis-wrote the actual name of the church, which is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days, and said that Mormons are not Christians, which they are.  What kind of sick, twisted person goes around trying to purposely degrade other people's religions, I don't know, but please don't confuse actual Mormons with Mr. Richardson. <br />Anyway, on to the album. I'm a new fan of Pearl Jam, and this is the only album of theirs I've listened to so far.  Over all, I really liked it.  I'd give the songs \\"Black\\" and \\"Garden\\" five stars, definitely. \\"Jeremy,\\" \\"Evenflow,\\" and \\"Release\\" were also excellent. <br />Thanks.  <br />
B000BJS4OY|5.0|On of the greatest rock albums of all time newly remasterd.  Plus the documentary on the making of this historic album and the clincher previously unreleased live at Hammersmith Odeon which is truly amazing.  The cd sounds better than ever and the live dvd shows Bruce at his best. A must have for all Boss fans!!<br /><br />Everybody has a problem with one record company or another.  It's a simple thing afraid there might be virus attached to something put out by Sony then don't play it in your computer.  Home stereos and dvd players hooked to televisions still exist.<br /><br />Went to read review of Van Zant's \\"Get Right With The Man\\" and all they had people bashing Sony and no reviews.  So notice I have written a review of \\"Born to Run\\" (see above).
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Wow, i got to hear a early release of this album and boy she still has it folks.All the songs are very upbeat and !!!!you will be dancing !!!.I had liked her older music better until now .I think this album is her best yet...!!!now can we have her video collection for these please!!!???
B000024D4R|5.0|This has got to be one of their most underrated album ever.
B000BGH22W|1.0|Note to Patrick Doyle, when taking on a soundtrack in a monster blockbuster film, and that is number 4 in a series, you might want to go with the flow of soundtracks past.  I had high hopes for this album.  While I am a true diehard John Williams fan, I truly enjoyed Doyle's Much Ado About Nothing and The Secret Garden.  So I thought, hmm, he just might be able to pull it off, maybe create a nice complementing score that would reflect on the themes of soundtracks past while including his own inspiration.  Was I wrong.  While Doyle does have a few, (notice the few) nice additions to the Potter music saga, such as Foreign Visitors Arrive, much of this score is atonal and jarring to the ear.  Thudding beats that sound like war cries, and sloppy editing confuses the overall score.  While it may work in the film, I don't know, I haven't seen it yet, it does not sit well with my ears that have grown used to William's brilliant score.  And I won't even get into the rock tracks at the end.  I am a true fan of the books, the movies, and the music.  I'll just pretend that this one doesn't exist.
B0000085N4|4.0|Sonic Temple came out after the raw & rockin Electric and it was more polished (overproduced?). Electric has a few of my fav Cult songs but I think Sonic Temple is better overall. The singles/videos from the album were Fire Woman, Edie (ballad), and Sweet Soul Sister, all good songs worthy of my i-pod. Other songs I dig are Sun King, American Horse , New York City, Automatic Blues, and Soldier Blue. There are a few songs I tend to fast forward over but most of the album is strong. The Cult seemed to change their sound with each album they put out in the 80s but I think they are all worth owning. I would rank Sonic Temple second just behind the psychedelic rock of Love.
B00007LTIA|2.0|Sorry I know that some people are really into this album but I just didn't get it. While Tangerine Dream abandoned the concept of rock and just had fun making weird synth sounds, Yes and ELP not only wanted to retain the status of rock musicians, they promoted of the idea of the \\"concept album\\" a dreadful idea that almost killed rock.  Tales from Topographic Ocean is too meandering to pass as rock but yet annoying enough that it can't quietly filed under ambient. If you see this in your parent's lp collection, don't ask. You don't want to know.
B0007OCG56|1.0|This movie has many flaws and sets a poor example for women. <br /> <br />1.  Much overlooked in the most thoughtful and sweet person in the movie in Tea Leoni's character, despite her enlarged-for-TV foibles (and no girlfriends to air them with.  Very curious Hollywood oversight: a rich American woman living in Malibu with no friends...even false ones??). Yet she strives to be good in her own ways.  a. She hires a maid with no experience who doesn't even speak English, and then pays her handsomely (lest we forget her beauty was obvious and would have tempted the husband).  b. she takes the maid's daughter out for a girl's day and treats her to the chagrin of the maid  c. She helps the maid's daughter get a scholarship and tries to assimilate her into their family circle. <br /> <br />2.  Adam Sandler's character never empathised with his wife's neurotic condition and just brushed her off, unless sex was involved.  Then during the act, he quips a turn off comment: \\"You don't even need me (to orgasm) do you?\\" hurting her feelings.  Of course he has lustful eyes for the help since their 1st meeting.  Bum. <br /> <br />3.  Worst of all, Paz Vega (Flor).  What an ungrateful, slutty, needy character!  She coyly makes Tea Leoni out to be the bad seed and is a lousy housekeeper (anybody notice the patio was always a mess while she was busy learning her English tapes?)  She sexually teases Adam Sandler, always lingering a little too long for comfort with her pretentiously shy behaviour (yeah why'd she pull him away to a quiet part of the beach at night to talk?)   To top it off she didn't want her daughter to succeed, but rather to live out a slum existence with her so she wouldn't die of lonliness.  She makes her give up her scholarship for no good reason, not wanting better for her kid.  Saddest part of all was the daughter giving up so soon.  She miraculously cheered up on the way home in the bus.  What a lousy, feel bad comedy!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|of JOHNB's review above, what the heck is that about.  save your crap for a product you actually bought and for that which you can serve a legitimate opinion.<br /><br />If you are a true fan, you want this in your collection.  Video from 1975 is amazing and the remastered disc is worth the money.
B000AGTPUA|2.0|Well, in the first place this is scary.  Scary in a Leni Refenhstal level (ok, probably I mispelled her last name).  Christmas is not universal, and Santa Claus (called many names in many countries) is less so.  This movie says that if you don't believe in a fat old man in a Coca-Cola suit that has a big factory with many many workers slaved in the North Pole you're out.  This kind of novo-fascism is not new for Robert Zemeckis: all of you remember that ode to stupidity and conformity that was \\"Ggggump... Forrest Gump\\" (I couldn't resist it, sorry).<br />Since I was a child my parents told me that there is not such thing as Santa, and so I learned to judge my presents as a proof of the hard work (giving the proper economic conditions) that my parents did during the year (or at least that month).<br />So, the movie.<br />The animation is incredible (for 2004) but the faults in the characters' eyes and mouths make all the effort almost worthless.  Some rollercoaster moments must be great when seeying them in IMAX-3D (I suposse), but for most of us is a second-hand experience, when yout hink this would be great in such screen or another.  When the best sequence in all the film involves a train ticket blown by the wind (a motive by now in Zemeckis filmography) but none of the human characters is in it, you have a problem.  Still, a must for CGI fans.<br />Btw, the score by Alan Silverstri sounds like a half-baked version of the sublime score Danny Elfman composed for \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" (now that's a Christmas story!).
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I loved the first single on this album \\"Hung Up\\" which propelled me to buy the CD but I love every song on here.  The songs all blend together and I really liked that, you can feel like you're at a dance club while driving in your car.  Even though the songs continue along at a similar pace, it is calming and energizing at the same time.  I love this CD
B00080ZG10|3.0|Every genius has a price to be paid.  When the Greek mythological hero Achilles was born, he had a choice: He either could live a short glorious life or a long uneventful life.  Achilles chose the short glorious life.  In much the same way Howard Hughes made this bargain with his life it seems.  In order to accomplish the tremendous things he did with his life, the gods dictated that he had to be afflicted with out of control paranoia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Scorsese wisely chronicles the `glory' years of Hughes in \\"The Aviator\\" from the 20's to the 40's.  However, the crippled, broken and sick man that Hughes changed into is foreshadowed by some incredible acting by DiCaprio.  How Hughes was able to accomplish all that he did despite his mental handicap only underscores his genius.  20th Century America produced geniuses in abundance from Henry Ford to Bill Gates, but Howard Hughes could be called a Renaissance Man/Industrialist.  His interests ranged not only from aviation to movies, but also to engineering and politics.  Hughes left his stamp on everything in 1900's America from the rise of the movie industry to Watergate.  To demonstrate the relentlessness of Hughes' life, Scorsese's film speeds by at a breathless pace.  The pace of the movie is further quickened by period music and Howard Shore's incredible score.  Hughes genius is evident throughout the movie, but he also had an amazing amount of clairvoyance in the way he predicted and invested in the emerging trends of the future.  America still continues to be the global leader in movie production and is still a leader in new aviation technology.  Scorsese's Hughes does not endear himself to anyone, and the only person that seems to really care about him is Hepburn, played with uncanny precision by Blanchett.  The other person that cares about him is his operations manager, Noah Dietrich, played by John C. O'Reilly.  Dietrich acts like a surrogate father for Hughes as Howard descends into madness and paranoia.  The rest of the people around him thought of him as merely a `meal ticket.'  There have been several attempts to make a movie about Hughes, but Scorsese's attempt is the only one to make it off the ground.  For an industrialist/engineer like Hughes it is interesting that Hollywood has given him, on the whole, a positive portrayal.  This despite the fact that he was a major contributor to the Republican party.  In fact, the one time political persuasion is brought up, during the film, during the golf scene, Hughes is not even allowed to answer the question about what party he belongs to.  Another aspect of the movie is the new DiCaprio.  Early on, DiCaprio's Hughes tells Dietrich to inform the Tool Co. shareholders to call him Mr. Hughes from now on.  In much the same way, DiCaprio has certainly grown up since his more juvenile roles in \\"Titanic\\" and \\"The Beach.\\"  Some have complained that Leo was poorly cast in this movie as Hughes and DiCaprio look nothing alike.  While this may be true, I believe that DiCaprio's youthful appearance serves to emphasize what Hughes was like during the `glory' years, in contrast to the sick, twisted man he became later on in life.s and paranoia.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|The new songs included in the (originally fabulous) \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" should be considered as old songs, not new. Mariah Carey brings once again more of the same which bores pretty fast, if you buy it, it will be for a very short term usage then you'll be wanting to get rid of it as soon as possible.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Life isn't easy, it isn't fair and we all have to suffer through it. However, we should count our blessings, one of these blessings is Madonna and this album. If the purpose of this album is to make you smile, happy and dance then by GOD it does its job well, very well. <br /> <br />Confessions is an INCREDIBLE album, track by track the album is one of the best things in pop music today and it EXHUDES an energy that just sucks you in. Hung Up, the HIT first single is the tip of the iceberg, as you listen to the album, tracks like Get Together, Sorry and Future Lovers will make you dance to the thumping beats non-stop and Madonna's sexy voice carries you from song to song. Stand out tracks are Jump, Let It Will Be and the DIVINE Isaac which makes you want to get on your knees and prance! (prance = pray and dance) Future Lovers is incredibly danceable, it really defies gravity. <br /> <br />Forbidden Love is a beautiful up-tempo ballad, that slows the pace of the album half way through but still doesn't damage the feel of the album. How High is another stand out track on the album, Madonna takes something personal and makes it universal (thanks to awesome beats). <br /> <br />The album comes to an end with Like It Or Not, and it does so brilliantly. How ironic is it to finish a dance album up with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br />I Love New York's quirky lyrics take a little getting used to, the song is OK at first but it may grow on you, it certainly is growing on me. Push is an excellent track but it can get repetitive. Those two things would be my only gripe with the album. <br /> <br />I'll leave you with this. If you are a Madonna fan, this album will be one of her best if not her best album to date for you. It rivals Ray of Light in terms of quality IMO. If you like POP music, this is better than 99% of the trash being released today. If you like dance music, then bring on the glow sticks and warm up your feet, this album is MADE. FOR. YOU!!! The clubs will never sound as good as they will in the next year. Thank You Madonna for bringing joy into our life, because this is exactly what the album is, a BUNDLE OF JOY wrapped just you (and your feet).
B000BO0LLS|1.0|By relaunching for the 3rd time the same album with new songs that are EXACTLY (and I mean it literally) like the old ones <br />And the lyrics? \\"them chickens i'm sausage\\" or something like that... <br />What the he** was she thinking?
B00005AKQE|4.0|While shopping online, I came across this CD and wondered, \\"What's the difference between this one and the regular 'Human Clay' CD?\\"  Well, a good bit.<br />For example, the clarity on this CD is a lot better than the original and there is one surprise: a bonus track called \\"Young Grow Old\\", an absolutely awesome offering from Creed.<br />However, there isn't much else original about the CD- and that's fine.  The original \\"Human Clay\\" CD is here, with its showcase offerings like \\"With Arms Wide Open\\", \\"Higher\\", and \\"What If\\", and nothing is missing that made \\"Human Clay\\" great.  Still, there's just something missing that prevents me from giving it the full 5 stars.  Also, the second CD contains acoustic versions of \\"What's This Life For\\" and \\"With Arms Wide Open\\", plus three other songs.<br />Overall rating: classic Creed, with a brand new single- what more can you ask for?  4.5 stars
B0000683DH|5.0|Some 20-plus years after Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was released, I had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen very recently with a packed house in New York City.  I will not bore you with my \\"review\\" of the film itself (you have 300-plus other people here to do that for you!) but I will add that this is one of the best theater experiences I've ever had period.  The movie is just thrilling to see with an audience.  You forget how some of the lines are extremely funny or extremely cheesy, and how timeless a joy it is to watch the Original Star Trek crew do their thing.  SPOILER ALERT (if you really have been living in a cave)- Spock's death scene literally silenced the house.  No one dared to make a peep.  When Spock says to Jim Kirk \\"I have been and always shall be... your friend.\\" I heard people weeping behind me.  SPOILER END- Some may roll your eyes at reading this, but the point is, the movie has as much emotional impact now as it did years ago, and even to an audience who have seen it countless times.  The movie cooks... it moves at a breakneck speed and by the time you get to the end you want to get on for another ride.  This movie is fun all the way. <br /> <br />Bravo, Star Trek!  Thank you for all your great voyages, and even some of the lesser ones too.  Star Trek II is simply the best of all.

B000B5XOY8|4.0|Perhaps it isn't fair to compare 1989's \\"Batman\\" to the recent relaunch \\"Batman Begins\\" because these two movies serve separate goals.  When \\"Batman\\" came out in the late 80's, you were coming off the recent birth of the blockbuster, from the \\"Indiana Jones\\" series and \\"Star Wars.\\"  \\"Batman Begins\\" is a stricter adherent to the tone of recent comic book incarnations, and therefore is preferable in terms of its seriousness and character depth.  What this \\"Batman\\" serves first and foremost is the sense of adventure and the thrill you get seeing the Dark Knight whup on Joker for a couple of hours.<br /><br />You've probably seen the movie, so let's get to the DVD specs.  The commentary track by Tim Burton was something I was looking forward to most when buying this new 2-disc version.  Burton's commentary is almost annoying- he fails to articulate himself clearly and when he does get going, he usually doesn't make any interesting comments.  It would have been helpful to have the writer, Sam Hamm or even the actors jump in with Burton, but Burton is alone on this one and he sounds as if he needs his meds adjusted.<br /><br />The DVD featurettes are much better.  There is a very well-produced documentary on the History of Batman.  The documentary is a bit more pro-Bob Kane than I would have preferred (in that recent history has shown Bob Kane to be more a hands-off creator of Batman and his supporting cast, using the work of others under his direction and taking the credit for their efforts) but since Mr. Kane recently passed away, it is only tasteful that they revere him as the essential catalyst to Batman.<br /><br />The picture and sound is very impressive.  You will obviously notice the effects work at the time is not up to current standards, but on some level it fits the charm of a 1980's Batman (as Burton properly points out in a rare lucid moment on the commentary track).<br /><br />This is a worthy DVD set to add to your collection, far better than the previous bare-bones DVD that has haunted the marketplace for far too long.  Finally, we have a DVD worthy of \\"Batman.\\"the previous bare-bones DVD that has haunted the marketplace for far too long.  Finally, we have a DVD worthy of \\"Batman.\\"

B0002858YS|5.0|Great album. Great music. Great lyrics. Absolutely loving it. <br /> <br />Hot Fuss has the tonal qualities and instrumental layers mnemonic of The Cure with those classic, repetitive, guitar and bass lines that are so reminiscent of U2. Despite these retro sounding attributes, it has a sound of it's own with harmonies that are so well blended it's hard to pick out the different voices.  <br /> <br />Front man Brandon Flowers has a voice like bitter-sweet chocolate.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I have not purchased this trilogy on DVD and I will not.  Mr. Lucas either has forgotten, or does not respect the people that flocked to the theatres and made him the zillionaire he is today.  I do not begrudge the special editions to anyone who loves them and wishes to purchase them, but I will never, ever understand why Mr. Lucas refuses to release these movies as they were originally shown.  I'd be willing to bet that Stephen Spielberg would never disrespect the fans of his movies this way.  Of course he wouldn't, that's why I have all three original Indiana Jones movies in my DVD collection.      This review is being edited because Mr. Lucas did release the true originals for DVD and I am now a proud possessor of all three.  My other thoughts remain the same which is why I will not purchase the movies in Blu-Ray.  I'm a little sorry about that too.  Perhaps one of these days the originals will be on Blu-Ray for us purists.  One can hope.
0440224764|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the intricacies and twists in Patrick Lanigan's master plot to rip off his crooked law firm of enough money to be set for life. As someone who had gotten tired of Grisham's plot technique of using a super-powerful all-knowing company or firm who could track our hero to the ends of the earth and ruin in his life, this was a refreshing change.  Quite the opposite was true-those seeking Lanigan were perilously close to running out of money for the effort.  Also, the painstaking methods for tracking Lanigan's whereabouts were spelled out entirely for the reader, silencing even the most doubtful reader.  In many of Grisham's other books, he shirks on the plot-building duties and just tosses out a super-sleuth team that can find anyone anywhere with no explanation.<br /><br />I enjoyed the non-linear storytelling style:  the book opened with Lanigan being found by his pursuers, and then the backstory of how and why he stole the money, and how he hid from his pursuers, is filled in.  For most of the book, Lanigan looks like a \\"bad guy\\" himself, in fact.  It was a nice change-up on the way the plot was laid out.<br /><br />Many have complained about the end of the book.  I enjoyed the journey enough to trust Grisham with the end.  I'll leave all readers to make up their own mind about Lanigan's fate.
0060005696|4.0|I remember reading about ten or twelve years ago of Russian immigrants to America who were overwhelmed by the choices in the average supermarket. Accustomed to a choice of cereal or no cereal, they became paralyzed when confronted with flakes, puffs, pops, sugared or not, oat, wheat, corn, rice, hot or cold, and on and on. Now, according to Barry Schwartz, we are all overwhelmed by too many choices.<br /><br />No one is immune, he says. Even if someone doesn't care about clothes or restaurants, he might care very much about TV channels or books. And these are just the relatively unimportant kinds of choices. Which cookie or pair of jeans we choose doesn't really matter very much. Which health care plan or which university we choose matters quite a lot. How do different people deal with making decisions?<br /><br />Schwartz analyzes from every angle how people make choices. He divides people into two groups, Maximizers and Satisficers, to describe how some people try to make the best possible choice out of an increasing number of options, while others just settle for the first choice that meets their standards. (I think he should have held out for a better choice of word than \\"satisficer.\\")<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that Schwartz dismissed the voluntary simplicity movement so quickly. They have covered this ground and found practical ways of dealing with an overabundance of choice. Instead of exploring their findings, Schwartz picked up a copy of Real Simple magazine, and found it was all about advertising. If he had picked up a copy of The Overspent American by Juliet Schor or Your Money or Your Life by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin instead, he might have found some genuine discussion of simple living rather than Madison Avenue's exploitation of it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first part of The Paradox of Choice, about how we choose, but the second half, about regret and depression, seemed to drag. Fortunately, I was able to choose to skim the slow bits and move right to the more interesting conclusion, about how to become more satisfied (or \\"satisficed\\") through better decision-making.w bits and move right to the more interesting conclusion, about how to become more satisfied (or \\"satisficed\\") through better decision-making.  <br />
1568461828|5.0|A very dear friend of mine gave me a copy of Roberto Innocenti's lavishly illustrated take on Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" A holiday classic in its own right (check out the wonderful 1938 cinematic adaptation starring Reginald Owen, newly released on DVD for the first time), Innocenti's incredibly detailed watercolours bring Dickens' London to life: we peer through windows to see mothers caring for sick children, see delights piled up in shop windows, and small details that give depth to the story (the Dutch-tiled fireplace in Scrooge's home, the Cratchit threadbare hovel). The paper stock is very good quality, as is the ink. A worthwhile investment for children old enough to appreciate this timeless tale, sure to become a treasured symbol of Christmas.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|When I first heard this album I was blown away. Next to Ray of Light, this is one of her best efforts to date. Finally Madonna is back to her roots, making music that isn't trying too hard to make an overly done political message or statement. It is what it is: fun, light, self-reflective, and entertaining. However, I still felt that there were some flaws to this album. First of all, the positives.<br /><br />I like how the album begins and ends, each track keeps on going without stopping, which gives a nice disco-club experience. But the only flaw in that is that it seems to have the same repetitive rhythm, and doesn't bring much of a punch after one song to another. And even though Madonna said that there are no ballads on this album, I still felt that the only song that was upbeat and energetic was Hung Up (which is my LEAST favorite song, after awhile it becomes quite annoying). The other songs seem to be much more mellow and more in depth, like Sorry and Isaac. Now the negatives.<br /><br />I couldn't help but feel a sense of laziness on Madonna's part throughout this whole album. I understand that this is a dance album, and that they aren't meant to be the most profound and deep, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be brainless! I respect Madonna for embracing her youthful spirit, regardless of the fact that she's growing to her late 40's, but sometimes I couldn't help but feel that she was trying way too hard to act like she's a 22-year old. She uses cheesy lyrics in some songs such as I Love New York (\\"other places make me feel like a dork?\\" um...ok...), and cliches like \\"sticks and stones will break by bones\\" (c'mon...). And I noticed that Madonna put a few samples of her own songs in the mix, which I thought was lazy as well. Even though this is a dance album, I honestly can't imagine any of these songs being played in a club. Madonna made it seem as if this was going to be her best dance album since her early years, but I didn't feel the groove, the vibe, or the energy. Sure, songs like Isaac had a little bit of inspiration, but nothing that brought me to my feet.<br /><br />But all in all, i think the shining star of the album is Isaac. When you listen to the song maybe you will see why. All in all, i would give this album an A for effort and creativity, but C for its overall rating. As I said before, I think Madonna tried too hard to be different. First of all, she doesn't need to prove anything at this point, and I still can't understand why she seems to constantly feel she has to prove something. And sometimes I wish Madonna would be more laid back with the promotion and hype and give us the same mature, profound album like Ray of Light, which was her best and non-forced album to date.the energy.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|All you have to do is look at my review of American Life, Madonna's last cd, to know that I was on the verge of not being a fan anymore. But just one listen to this album was all it took to change my mind! <br /> <br />This cd starts with the smash single \\"Hung Up.\\" Despite what some reviewers state, this single went to number one on iTunes in America this week. It also topped the charts in at least 19 other countries. So I would dare say this single is an international smash hit. It uses a tiny sample from Abba, but the song is much better than the song it samples! <br /> <br />Madonna is the only female artist to continually top the charts around the world for decades. Just when it looks like she is finished, she always reinvents herself to jump start her career. This cd is no exception. It's like she took disco from the late 70s and gave it new life. My favorite songs on the cd are Jump, Forbidden Love, Sorry, and Get Together. There is not a single dud on this cd! It is amazing that an artist like Madonna can come up with such a fresh sound after spending over twenty years in the entertainment industry. <br /> <br />This is the best dance album of the year and probably this century!
0312995423|3.0|Like Da vinci Code, a clever book but not a pretty one. <br />The writing is crisp, the plot moves along briskly and the ending is quite seismic. However, there are too many coincidences to be credible and the characterisation is very weak. One feels no empathy for the players and its difficult to really get involved in events.A fun read nevertheless.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|A number of critics and music reviewers have been talking about this cd as a retreat, or an attempt to only please Madonna's \\"core\\" audience - though that's one of the largest core audiences the world has ever seen. When I listen to this, that's not what I hear. This is such an energetic, pumping album - a huge, welcome relief after the misstep of American Life. (I tried to like that album, I really did, but it just didn't have good enough songs.) So, the ever-shifting Madonna changed gears. Frankly, I'm glad not to have a bunch of political songs, or songs about her mother. Madonna was at her introspective best on Ray of Light. She's not a kid anymore, but she's still meant for the dancefloors.<br /><br />This is a slick, exciting, extremely entertaining album. No, it's not like what I view as her masterpieces (Like a Prayer, Vogue, Ray of Light, Music) - but her masterpieces weren't like each other either.<br /><br />This is a move in the right direction, and I'll be excited to hear what she does next. But for right now, I'm happy to have what we have here.
0812975219|3.0|Fooled by Randomness is an examination of human behavior through the prism of Wall Street and world capital markets. Mr. Taleb makes an assault on modern financial economics, as he rationalizes his work and world as an option trader.  It is an interesting and sincere book; often inspired, provocative and ambitious.  Yet, by the final chapter, confusion remains about the state of the financial world and our knowledge of it.  Readers are left no better off for facing the realities of financial markets. Ultimately, Mr. Taleb's thinking becomes diffuse, forcing him as a matter of logic to adopt a stoic resignation from what he portrays as a relatively hopeless picture of human existence.<br /><br />Since Mr. Taleb's claims about the nature of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis are erroneous, his assessment of the surrounding world is needlessly skeptical and unduly harmful to knowledge of human behavior and market institutions.  He vacillates between a rational assessment of the practical world of high finance and his own emotional reactions to the daily vicissitudes of life inside it. He makes many thoughtful observations about the limits of human rationality and the role of chance in our lives. But, he also succumbs to half truths unwittingly concocted from sketchy application of relevant literary, philosophical and scientific subjects.<br /><br />There are several valuable insights in this book, such as the retelling of Hume's \\"black swan\\" fallacy, the \\"Monte Carlo fallacy\\", the \\"signal versus noise\\" theorem and the \\"survivorship\\" bias.  But, as useful as these insights are, their probity is negated by the weak accounts of works such as that of Skinner and Tyversky and Kahneman. Mr. Taleb does not explore these subjects in a complete or methodical way.  His superficial explorations leave the impression that these works are contradictory to, rather than additive to, our maintenance of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.<br /><br />Seen in an impartial light, the Efficient Markets Hypothesis is not an abuse of science as Mr. Taleb contends.  Through study after study, we observe repeatedly that the relative degree of efficiency in capital markets is high, conditional on the interactions of our existing (and admittedly vulnerable) worldwide institutions.<br /><br />There is no question that from time to time these institutions fail in a catastrophic way.  But, that does not mean that our provisional understanding of these same institutions is entirely incorrect.  It simply means we still have more to learn. And, since it is Mr. Taleb's business to bet against the stability of global institutions, he could have provided a more interesting tale of the battle of titans that occurs in the aggregation worldwide capital.  He could have been clearer about how he is playing a long-term game focused on systematic risks. He could have told us more of the great rewards and punishments that ride on the small margins of uncertainty and error at the center of his story.is not an abuse of science as Mr. Taleb contends.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's CD will be a warm welcome home to you if you liked her roots: that disco and pop type of music that made her famous to begin with. The music on all the songs here is very well done and arranged by Madonna herself and her team; and the lyrics are cool, too! In the song entitled \\"I Love New York,\\" Madonna rhymes \\"New York\\" with dork.\\" That sassiness ain't bad, ain't bad at all.<br /><br />Yes, the songs are put together as if a DJ had mixed them on the dance floor. Each song seems to flow into the next. I especially liked the songs \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Isaac,\\" with its acoustic guitar and lyrics in Hebrew! Very different and creative for sure! Some will say that the flow of the songs makes them blur together so that none of them stand out in particular; but I for one really liked the album and it fits together as an album somewhat better than her other album, \\"American Life,\\" ever did.<br /><br />Madonna also deserves a good deal of credit for co-writing and co-producing every song on this CD. She was ably helped out Stuart Price, better known professionally as Les Rhythmes Digitales! This is also a CD allowing her to express herself rather personally since Madonna always loved to dance. Her love of dance is also accentuated by the themes of empowerment and independence. For example, Madonna sings the line \\"I can take care of myself,\\" in her song entitled \\"Sorry,\\" and she echoes this sentiment again in the song called \\"Jump\\" with the confidently self-sufficient words \\"I can make it alone.\\" Powerful stuff!<br /><br />In short, Madonna succeeds rather well in creating for us all an album in which she goes back to her roots while yet making references to her present and future by means of her Hebraic chanting and her references to independence. She uses the scene of her dancing on a dance floor as a backdrop that allows her to express her true feelings while dancing. She's not a kid anymore; but she STILL knows how to party hard and she can stay up late moving the crowd on that dance floor anytime she pleases. A highly recommended CD for Madonna fans (naturally), and fans of this type of rock and pop!g the crowd on that dance floor anytime she pleases.

B0009UC7HA|4.0|I watched this over the weekend on my wife's recommendation -- something that I usually avoid because she has an unnerving penchant for chick-flicks.  Strangely enough, this one was pure adventure and action from beginning to end (which is more my taste in movies) and we both enjoyed it.<br /><br />I've only seen a handful of Matthew McConaughy movies over the years, but this may well be my favorite -- just because the Dirk Pitt character is just so darned cool.  He's a true man's man -- ex Navy Seal, treasure hunter, and semi-credible action hero, complete with dashing good looks, a keen wit and a full head of wavy dark hair that is the envy of bald guys like me.  In short, he's the consummate studly guy.<br /><br />Pitt is cool, but he has some good support from guys like Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), Admiral Sandecker (well acted by William H. Macy), and the predictably babish Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz).  The story is fast-moving, the stakes high (saving the world, as is usual in movies like this), and the plot is only modestly cliche.  In short, as long as you don't intend to take this too seriously or seek a profound commentary on the meaning of life, the universe and everything, you're liable to have a lot of good clean fun with this movie.  Enjoy it.  I did.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Everyone please stand for the Queen. CONFESSIONS ON A DANCEFLOOR is a truimphant return to form for Madonna. This 12-track set is brilliant, gorgeous, retro yet somehow light years ahead of anything her depressing peers could ever conjured up. From the infectious opening of HUNG UP that flows into my favorite GET TOGETHER, those two songs set the tone for this disc. Every song sounds like it could be released as single. Other favorites include SORRY, LET IT WILL BE, the sweet FORBIDDEN LOVE, the powerhouse jam JUMP and unexpected closer LIKE IT OR NOT. Basically CONFESSIONS ON A DANCEFLOOR is one 2005's best, a gem in today's disgusting musical landscape. Grammy Awards will be defintely awarded for this breathtaking dance odyssey. All hail to the Queen!!!!
B000006NXP|5.0|Kleiber's interpretation of Brahms' final symphony is the sine qua non of any classical music collection.  Brahms is part Bach part Beethoven but mostly himself. That said, his symphonies are some of the most significant accomplishments in the classical repertoire because he combined the better achievements of his two predecessors.  This Fourth is not his best, (the Third is) but Kleiber casts a spell that cannot be ignored.  Therefore, consider this one of the musical gems that you must have if only for the first movement alone.  This disc (and Tchaikovsky's Fourth by Bernstein) have been replaced more times than any others in my collection.  And every time, I only buy the Kleiber version.  Kleiber sustains the demands of Brahms from alpha to omega as few other conductors can, especially the rondo-fugue and theme-and-variations which are demanding without relent.  In toto, the Fourth lacks the organicity (intentionally so) of its predecessor pair.  That said, the first movement is the most beautiful twelve minutes of sound you will ever hear.  I could swear it were the name of God.  And you will too.

B000BGH22W|5.0|I'm frankly quite surprised at the high level of negative comments this score is receiving.  Sure, I miss John Williams, but Patrick Doyle has more than stepped up to the plate here.  This music is some of the most intense, beautiful, and massive stuff Doyle has written, and rather than merely mimicking William's themes, he creates new (yet stylistically similar) material, though he allows William's main theme to show up here and there, providing a sense of continuity.  <br /> <br />It's remarkable how varied this score is, yet how coherent it feels.  It goes from romantic (Harry in Winter) to fun (Neville's Waltz) to intensely dark (Voldemort), and never seems jarring or out-of-place.  Listen to a cue like \\"The Golden Egg\\", the orchestra's sheer power is as intense as anything this year.  The album is an astonishly good entry into the series, equalling the best of William's work, and surpassing the hack job that was \\"Chamber of Secrets\\".  The songs at the end are my only complaint, they feel completely inappropriate and out-of-place, especially \\"Do the Hippogriff\\" (which has a disturbing title, IMO).  That aside, Doyle's contribution is nothing short of fabulous, and I highly recommend the score not only to Potter fans, but to fans of film scores in general.

0553801503|5.0|Many people are criticizing this book for following \\"minor characters.\\"  This is entirely untrue.  The characters it follows are Cersei, Jaime, some Sansa, some Arya, Brienne (searching for Sansa), some Samwell, as well as following the Greyjoy drama surrounding their throne.  Exactly which of these is a \\"minor character\\"? <br /> <br />While none of these characters are probably your favorites, it is entirely wrong to call this book \\"bad\\" or of lesser quality than the others in the series.  Martin's writing is still excellent, and the plot advances and is interesting from page 1.  There is no wheel-spinning, no chaff.  Martin's story is one of hundreds of threads, and its intricacy demands that *all* of a story be told.  The only way that this book can be slammed is if you are willing to call the happenings at King's Landing unimportant and unnecessary.   <br /> <br />Which brings me to my next point.  As Martin himself says, this book is about King's Landing and everything surrounding it.  The next installment will deal with all your favorites...Jon on the wall, Dany across the sea, Davos, Bran, Tyrion...and all of that will take place at the same time as all the events in *this* book.   <br /> <br />So before you down this book, imagine how entertaining the next one will be.  Look at this as an excellent appetizer and be patient, for once.  At least with Martin you know that you will be getting the best possible writing.

B000BGH22W|3.0|I must admit that when I first heard the score for this movie, I was disappointed. It simply just didn't \\"capture the magic\\" like the three previous scores by John Williams. I am not attempting to say that Patrick Doyle doesn't have talent, his musical creativity for this movie was good. But it's just that, good.  <br /> <br />I think that while watching the movie, the music will lend its compliments, but I do not see myself humming the tunes in my head. In the end, it simply falls short of John Williams utter magical ability with music. But then again, who can truly match that?

When the album was released, it debuted at #1 on the U.K. and U.S. charts, with 350,607 sold in the U.S., and 217,610 in the U.K. which is Madonna's biggest opening sales for any of her albums in the U.K. \\"Hung Up,\\" the first single from the album, debuted at #20 on the Hot 100 in America, but evetually climbed to #7. This gives Madonna her biggest hit since \\"Don't Tell Me\\" hit #4 in 2000. \\"Hung Up\\" has already achieved Platinum sales in the U.K. (over 500,000 copies sold), and the album has went 4x Platinum in the same place, with 1,200,000 shipments sold to date and over 1,100,000 sales. \\"Hung Up\\" has also achieved 700,000 downloads in the U.S. The second single, \\"Sorry\\", proved to be less successful, peaking at #58 in the U.S., but still stalling at #1 in the U.K. \\"Get Together\\", the third single, is already burning up airplay charts Worldwide, but only charted at #7 in the U.K. and #6 on the Bubbling Under The Hot 100 chart in the U.S. There, the album has sold 1,522,061 copies to date, and has went Platinum. Confessions On A Dance Floor went #1 in 41 countries, and has sold 8 million copies worldwide so far.     1. \\"Hung Up\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Get Together\\" (10/10)  3. \\"Sorry\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Future Lovers\\" (10/10)  5. \\"I Love New York\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Let It Will Be\\" (10/10)  7. \\"Forbidden Love\\" (10/10)  8. \\"Jump\\" (10/10)  9. \\"How High\\" (10/10)  10. \\"Isaac\\" (10/10)  11. \\"Push\\" (10/10)  12. \\"Like It Or Not\\" (10/10)    \\"Confessions,\\" dare I say, is Madonna's best studio set to date (better than \\"Bedtime Stories\\" by a bit). \\"Hung Up\\" is a great dance song, and definately gets your body moving. \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Sorry\\" are two of the albums best tracks, the latter being the second single, and the former being my favourite. \\"Future Lovers\\"and \\"I Love New York\\" are the next two tracks, the former being a better song. Some of the lyrics on NY are so bad, but you have to forgive Madonna!! \\"Let It Will Be\\" is brilliant, whereas \\"Forbidden Love\\" will be remembered for the same name on her \\"Bedtime Stories\\" (1994) album. This is a different song, and it's ten times better. \\"Jump\\" is rumoured to be the third and great single, and \\"How High\\" expresses Madonna's robotic/vocoder voice more. \\"Isaac\\" is fantastic. This seriously NEEDS TO BE HEARD! Madonna goes back to her Kallabah routes! \\"Push\\" and \\"Like It Or Not\\" end the album nicely. \\"Like It Or Not\\" is another in-your-face song, which I love about Madonna.

B000BEZPQE|5.0|this cd is a live cd of all there stuff. and if your a sliknot fan aka maggot then you will love this cd. it has energy and much more. my fav slipknot songs live are wait and bleed,duality, spit it out.
B000050FEN|5.0|Se7en is one of, if not the, best movies I have seen. Brad Pitt and Morgan freeman are awsome in it. <br /> <br />The movie follows two detectives who are chasing down a serial killer who is killing according to the 7 deadly sins. I guess that would be a short summary of it. However there is so much more to this movie that you must see.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I love this cd. Im so glad for Mariah to have a great comeback and re release with some more hit tracks is great!
B000002LRX|5.0|I don't mean that sacractically, this album is the most important record any band did during the entire decade.  Nirvana?  Sure, they were good at what they did, but were they original? Nope.  Pearl Jam?  Pleeeeease..  If you look at all the bands who were big around the same time Angel Dust came out (I'm talking about Soundgarden, Metallica, Guns n' Roses, etc...), they were all so much more successful than FNM because they played it SAFE.  There's nothing safe about Angel Dust, they played against type, they rocked harder, they confused and made the listener THINK, they did everything they could possibly do to make this the brilliant, unpredictable masterpiece it is.  It sounds like nothing they'd done before, and it was truly their peak. Lesser talents like Korn and Deftones took the Faith No More sound and watered it down to become the (already dead) nu metal scene in the following years, but no one can touch the original. And look at the one-time competition today.. Chris Cornell is singing Hallmark card greetings in the after-school-special pop band Audioslave, Metallica have become a disgusting parody of what they once were, Korn's run itself into the ground, the guys from GnR are making pathetic \\"rock star\\" pop with that hack Weiland, and so on..  Compare this to Mike Patton, who, aside from having 3 or 4 bands on tap at all times since FNM's demise, he's still making music no one's ever heard before, his voice and lyrics are as incredible as ever, and he's not lost one ounce of his integrity. But back to the point, Angel Dust is a MUST for any true rock fan who appreciates a band with balls and a vision.
B0002S947K|5.0|This is by far the most moving CD I have ever purchased. I owe it all to amazon.com for enlightening me to this amazing singer. I had purchased Amos Lee's CD and happened to see Ray LaMontagne's name in the list of other titles purchased. Wow....I have been waiting for a very long time for a CD of this caliber. With his raspy, soulful voice and his songs of heartache he tugs at my heart strings like no other has even come close to. I knew I had to have it when tears came to my eyes just listening to the samples. I can't listen to \\"Burn\\" or \\"Hannah\\" without choking back waves of emotional tears. \\"Trouble\\" and \\"How Come\\" are full of soul as well. I love it. Hands down the best music I have ever listened to. Thank you, Ray, for this refreshing change of pace in today's melodic coma....

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madge, Esther.....Madonna whatever her name is she is back.  Man she has done it again.  Talk about reinvention.  I especially love track 3 (SORRY).  This woman has been around from I was a kid and this proves that she has longevity.  She won't be on VH1's \\"Where Are They Now\\" or \\"One Hit Wonders\\" any time soon. For a woman almost 50 years old she has still got it in the music business (not to mention that her body is still da bomb)  I wasn't impressed too much with Ray Of Light or American Life but this is the Madonna I know that gives us the dance beats.  I hope she keeps her style of music.
B000BGH22W|5.0|This soundtrack has some really fantastic songs!<br /><br />Voldemort is fantastic!<br />The Golden Egg is Brilliant!<br />Harry in Winter is Marvelous!<br /><br />Such a great soundtrack!!!
B000BJS4OY|4.0|Those who buy this set hoping to obtain a remastered diamond, will find something similar to what they know.  The engineers have added some definition to the pieces, skimmed some strident noise off the top and cleaned up the bass. But over all, it's the same album.  An undistinguished remastering job.<br /><br />The making-of CD is fascinating and feature-length. It's probably worth the price of admission alone.<br />outer The package design is imaginative but odd. Sure, the box is sturdy, but shouldn't this event have merit some modified jewel cases instead of cardboard envelopes?  Couldn't the booklet have actually included some essays instead of some of the endless rock-archival photos that tell us very little?  Couldn't the producers have added some outtakes to the album disk, which runs under half its potential length?<br /><br />The original BTR album is an icon, and this aniversary album deserved a more arresting remastering job.
0783226845|5.0|when i first heard this film i thought it was gonna be a chick flick but after the 1st 10mins i was drawn into this film my eyes never left the screen. i love how this film has more then one plot. you have to love the speech at the end that pacino gives at the school on behave of charlie. there alone pacino nailed that oscar
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The album is absolutely fabulous!!! Especially the songs like \\"Hung Up\\", \\"I Love New York\\" and the best of the best - \\"Let It Will Be\\", which is just simply mindblowing!!! Not to mention the perfect mixing of the album, which makes the song start in the previous tracks ending and without gaps feels like it's a one big composition that u just can't get out of...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|One star? I don't think so. Five stars? Completely deserving of it. Are you interested in buying this cd, is that why you're reading these reviews? If so, please do yourself a favour and don't bother reading the one star reviews. They honestly haven't listened to the cd. This cd represents Madonna at her best and it is her best offering to us in YEARS. I have yet to dislike a cd of hers. I even liked the \\"dreadful\\" American Life cd. It's not that I am incapable of disliking anything from her (there are certainly songs of hers that I dislike), it's just that as a whole her cds always work very well. This cd is no different. There are no less than eight stellar tracks here. Hung up, Sorry, I Love New York, Jump, How High, Isaac, Push and Like it or Not are melodic pieces of pop brilliance. The other four tracks are good, they're just not as good (IMO). There is no filler here either which is rare today. Time magazine, Billboard, MTV, NME, Rolling Stone, People magazine and US Weekly all gave this cd an excellent or good review (how can they all be wrong?).If you are a fan of Madonna (either a little or a lot) or a fan of pop/dance music you can not go wrong with the purchase of this cd. This I swear to you. Beware the haters out there who have nothing better to do than to tear down talented artists. Peace.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|alright alright.. emancipation was great.. we all know that:) but damn.. the extra four songs are to die for!!! \\"dont forget about us\\" shows that her skills are as present as day one.. along with \\"what it look like\\".. he voice aint going anywhere kids!!! the remixes to \\"we belong together\\" and \\"so lonely\\" are kinda old and played out.. but still good nonetheless.. expect big wins for mariah at the Grammy's next year...!!!
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|There's an adage in the music business that you can always tell that an artist's career is over when they put out a Christmas album. Not so with Jethro Tull. This CD is alternately cheerful, moving, and thought provoking (if there's a more poignant Christmas song than \\"First Snow on Brooklyn\\" I want to hear it). <br />So forget all those pop and rock stars that put out CDs full of stale, overdone Christmas songs, forget the saccharine tear jerkers like \\"Christmas Shoes\\" and \\"Dear Mr. Jesus.\\" Get this CD and you'll be listening to it long after the holiday is over.
B000002JS6|5.0|AC/DC must be really really good; they can afford to opt out of iTunes. So, the old fogeys heard AC/DC live. Actually, they were after my concert years. Not too many real rock and roll bands after the late 60's. Actually, not too many before that either. Anyway, if you didn't know it: this is real rock and roll. Led Zep have some good tunes, but, like another reviewer has noted, too much \\"artistry\\". This is what rock is supposed to sound like. Spare me the \\"lemon juice running down my leg.\\" I'll go for \\"walls were shakin', the earth was quakin',\\" every time. Nice to hear that that's what a songwriter thinks too.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Bland! Bland! Bland! I used to love Mariah Carey (her first three cds were gold!!), however, she has just kind of slumped herself in between Beyonce and Ashanti. Nothing new here, nothing bold or daring or different. Just the same old tired and bland r&b. She's still got the voice, unfortunately it's just not enough nowadays. She's much more exciting when she's having a nervous breakdown.
B00006LHYC|5.0|This album is simply amazing! <br />The Italian Superstar has done it again, and in a new language to boot! She is in her element here and shows great vocals with very entertaining pop songs. I love this album it is very good! <br />I admit that she does sound a bit different, She does sing better in her mother tounge, Italian, but she sounds amazing here regardless!
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna has always been a major figure in not just the music industry, but pop culture as well.  As she got older, she tended to get crazier and crazier, until just recent times where she has decided to become more conservative.  That conservative nature shows on CONFESSIONS ON THE DANCE FLOOR for the simple fact that rather than going completely radical (Like the rap on the heavily criticized AMERICAN LIFE album (2003)), Madonna goes back to her roots in dance music with an album that places emphasis on the dance floor.  The biggest plus about this release is that it comes at a time where a resurgence of 1980s music for the most part is seen as great.  New wave bands have been captivating airwaves in 2005 (The Killer, The Bravery) while 80s dance-pop has seen a big resurgence (a la Gwen Stefani, Kelly Osbourne, even a less effective Ashlee Simpson on I Am Me).  CONFESSIONS, based on the resurgence of 1980s, Madonna's hey day, should have no problem going platinum, especially based upon the buzz of CONFESSIONS.<br /><br />The biggest plus of dance-pop always tends to be the production.  80s Pop was incredibly elaborate with experiments with drum programming to crazy, unfurling, driving synths.  CONFESSIONS ON THE DANCEFLOOR keeps those aspects alive as the production on the album is top notch.  Where Madonna herself doesn't make up for vocals (she has a thinner voice than some), the production fills the void.  To Madonna's credit, her vocals may be thin, but they are well performed and well produce and thin vocals are a characteristic of dance-pop music in general.  CONFESSIONS ON THE DANCEFLOOR successfully keeps the focus on dance with not true variations of that pattern on the album.  That in itself makes CONFESSIONS ON THE DANCEFLOOR a successful album.<br /><br />CONFESSIONS of course, is not without it flaws.  At times, the production tends to be a bit too sharp as well as too cluttered.  Sometimes the synths, which always sound good and fresh as well as reminiscent of the 1980s, tend to overpower Madonna's vocals (slightly on \\"Get Together\\").  When production is stripped down more (such as on \\"Let It Will Be\\"), Madonna's vocals come out of the texture better.  Where songwriting is concerned with dance-pop music, It is hard to make truly interesting songs that have some sense of depth.  As with most dance-pop albums, there are true winners here (\\"Hung Up\\", \\"Let It Will Be\\", \\"I Love New York\\", \\"Push\\", \\"Sorry\\", etc...), and there are those that are more filler material (\\"Forbidden Love\\" and \\"Like It Or Not\\").  For the most part, all of the tracks are listenable and they server their ultimate purpose of keeping the spirit of the 1980s alive.<br /><br />Personally, I think that this is a very unique album and it should fit very well in 2005, even if it is more of a comeback album, rather than true innovation on Madonna's part.  Good album.  4 stars Madonna.as reminiscent of the 1980s, tend to overpower Madonna's vocals (slightly on \\"Get Together\\").

B000002JPA|5.0|I've listened to all kinds of music, and Images & Words stands doubtlessly as arguably the best album I've ever heard.<br /><br />I've already written a review for this, but my tastes have chanegd, so I must update on it.<br /><br />While \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" is my personal favortie Dream Theater album, this is their all-around best album. This is also the first album I've ever heard by them.<br /><br />**Pull Me Under - The first song I've heard by Dream Theater (I saw the video for it on Headbanger's Ball). This used to be my favorite song here. I still love it. It has a memorable opening riff (which I can play on guitar), and goes into the metal song it is. I guess it has \\"that\\" ending because it's about death and death can be sudden. Anyways, this is their biggest hit song, and many fans seem to love. Still played to this day. Awesome guitar solo, as well.<br /><br />**Another Day - This song took a while for me to like. I, at first, thought it was too cheesy, and 80's. After repeated listens, and knowing what the song is about, I now love this song. Since it's about John Petrucci Sr.'s struggle with cancer, I realized the vocals couldn't be more appropriate. Beautiful song.<br /><br />**Take The Time - Another nice metal song. It starts with a keyboard intro. It then goes into what sounds like a military march drum pattern, then goes into a nice, heavy riff. This is followed by a neat keyboard solo. The opening lyrics get stuck in my head... \\"Just let me catch my breath...I've heard the promises, I've seen the mistakes, I've had my fair share of tough breaks, I need a new voice, new law, new life, take the time to reevaluate, it's time to pick up the pieces go back to suare one, I think it's time for a chaaaaaange!\\" Also, this is the only song that all the band members wrote lyrics for.<br /><br />**Surrounded - Eh. I'm not that big into this song that much. But it's still a great song! I love the keyboard intro. Catchy lyrics... \\"Dark to light, light to dark, dark to light, light to dark\\". I've read this song is about an AIDS victim (forgot the name right now). Not my favorite song here, but still great.<br /><br />**Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper - Holy s**t. Those two words popped into my mind when I first heard this song. My favorite song on the album, and a top five greatest Dream Theater song for sure! Ah, where to begin... It starts out with a keyboard/guitar intro, then a drum pattern, and then it explodes into the best song on the album! The music and lyrics are powerful. After that, I breaks into the best instrumental bridge ever written. Has an amazing guitar/keyboard solo. Then it breaks into a - YES - BASS SOLO! It has great tapping! Then comes another guitar/keyboard solo. Then it breaks back into what the song was. The lyrics are amazing. \\"There must be the third and last dance, this one will last forever, Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles, she's taken you to her home\\". Amazing, simply brilliant. Also, as everyone else knows, this is the prequel to their concept album \\"SFAM\\", which has plenty of references to this song. Okay, I've said enough about this song. Time to move on to the next...<br /><br />**Under A Glass Moon - The heaviest song on the album. It has a keyboard intro, then goes into a drum pattern, and then a heavy guitar riff. This used to be my favorite, as well. But I still love this song! The guitar solo at the end alone is worth the album!<br /><br />**Wait For Sleep - Eh, my least favorite song on the album, It's just James LaBrie singing over Kevin Moore's piano playing. I just consider it the intro into the next song...<br /><br />**Learning To Live - Tied with Metropolis for best song on the album. At 11:30, this is the longest song on the album. It starts with a keyboard intro, a drum beat, a great, catchy guitar riff, and just into a great song. The rest of the band goes into feedback, while John Myung does a bass line with James singing \\"There was no time for pain, no energy for anger\\". This is simply amazing. I've read that this song is about the AIDS virus. Also, keep in mind this album came out in 1992, when AIDS still scared the hell out of people. This song is simply brilliant. The instrumental bridge is amazing. The guitar solo at the end is the best solo on the album, IMHO! The outro is amazing (the part with LaBrie singing \\"Woah, oh oh oh\\" or something like that). It seems so long, but the song flies on the hell by! A brilliant album closer, like \\"Space-Dye Vest,\\" \\"Trial Of Tears,\\" \\"Finally Free,\\" \\"Losing Time/Grand Finale,\\" \\"In The Name Of God,\\" and \\"Octavarium\\".<br /><br />**=Must-listen songs.

015603008X|4.0|There are those who have attempted the topic before, to show the good or ill about artificially increasing a man's intelligence, and they have all fallen by the wayside, forgotten entries in the arena of literature, all because they forgot one factor: love. <br />In Flowers for Algernon, Keyes shows us a man who is jolted out of his comfortable world of stupidity and finds his friends who were not as good as he thought they were, that all he thought was nothing more than a veiled illusion. And he copes, as everyone must, he copes and finds love and comes to term with himself. <br /> <br />Just in time for him to realize that his intelligence is only temporary. In the most heart wrenching scenes of the novel, the reader must witness his intelligence fading rapidly, each journal entry a little less exact, the spelling a tiny bit worse, until the book comes full circle and he is back where he started from, only having a wisdom that he cannot understand, or comprehend. Touching, moving, Flowers for Algernon is all that and more, it is an epic of emotion, an opera of getting what you want most and then realizing that you might have been better off. <br /> <br />
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This is an excellent anniversary package of one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  Well done all the way around.  I'm not one that cares which record company puts it out.  If your worried about the copyright virus stuff don't play it in your computer.  For the reviewer that is touting Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, and Ashlee Simpson(you've got to be kidding, right?!) as geniuses, lay off the crack.  All of the people named (about the only one I'll give credit to is Madonna) are absolute crap.  Hey buddy, musical genius usually implies someone who writes their own songs and can play a musical instrument.  We've moved on, give me a break.  I think his explanation can pretty much tell you what to do with his review.  This is great collection, and a fine addition to any musical collection.  Usher and Ashlee Simpson, give me a break.  Popular music today sucks, has no soul, and is for the most ignorant of people.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you enjoyed \\"Firefly\\" the series, you'll love this movie.  It successfully picks up most of the plot strings where the series finale dropped them.  The actors fall effortlessly back into their roles.  Nathan Fillion deserves special praise.  If anything, he's made Mal even more the perfect tragic hero than he was in the series.  If you are invested in these characters, you won't be disappointed.  Surprised, yes...but not disappointed.
B000002NHN|4.0|I haven't listened to Loreena McKennitt in some time and it was pleasure revisiting her music.  It is best described as having an exotic, romantic celtic sound.  One reviewer said it is relaxing but not boring and I would agree.  This music will lift your sprit and is wonderful to listen to in the evening or at work to ease those daily stresses.  Bravo!
044022165X|5.0|Its simply the best book I have ever read.  I have read this book countless times, and everytime Im so sad when it ends.  It feels like I just lost my best friend! Mr Grisham, you really touched me here!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is truly the return of fun loving, nonstop dancing Madonna.  Just look at her recent performances on the EMAs and Star Academy and you can tell she's having the time of her life and more importantly proud of her work.  And she should be!  From the total campiness of Hung Up to the psychedelic beats of Future Lovers to the total 80s electro clash of Let It Will be all the songs on this album make you want to get up and dance all night.  She's done it again!  And it's good to be back in this place.  She's burning up!  Go Madonna!
B000BISBDY|1.0|Let's be clear: any time you assemble a collection of Johnny Cash's material, you've got something good. \\"The Legend of Johnny Cash,\\" however, is nothing special. First, there's no way to capture the glory of his career in one disc. His career spanned decades. Second, there are already some very good collections: \\"The Legend\\" a four-disc set that at least offers unreleased material, and \\"The Essential,\\" a two-disc set. The \\"God, Love, Murder, Life\\" collection includes music from all points in his career. <br /> <br />As there are tons of ways to collect cashes music, the publishers of Cash's catalog need to offer fans something fresh: more unreleased tracks and alternate versions, or at least a more comprehensive collection. While \\"The Legend of Johnny Cash\\" (not to be confused with the also recently released \\"The Legend\\") does span his entire career, from Sun to American Recordings, it does so at the expense of most of his career--only 8 songs cover the decades-long period between the Sun years and American Recordings. <br /> <br />I can't think of any reason why a fan of Cash would buy this collection. If you're new to Cash, it might make a good starting point, but the other collections in this review are better starting points.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After having released some very personal albums, Madonna has returned to the kind of music that first shoot her to fame in the beginning/mid 80's. COADF is an album filled with funny, catchy and outstanding pop songs. Everybody knows the first single and Abba sampling hit \\"Hung up\\", but COADF is so much more than that one song, from start to end it's an album that'll make you sing along, dance around your living room, and improove your mood a 100%.... More power to the queen of pop, this album should be sure to give her at least 4 or 5 more top 10 hits...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! Non-stop pure pop, jump out of your seat dance music. Destined to become a classic
B000BO0LLS|3.0|I've already reviewed \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" which was one of Mariah's most assured albums to me since \\"Butterfly\\" or the misunderstood gem \\"Glitter\\".  That said, I find it a bit annoying that she re-issued it for a paltry four songs, which I know are going to be filler at best. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is similar to ballads from her \\"Butterfly\\" era...but at the same time I wish she could've included the new single originally one the first pressing of the album.<br /><br />Also, with the release of that single, it sort of shows that (as usual) while Mariah is as mainstream as it gets, you wish she'd engage herself with more...ENGAGING music I guess.<br /><br />The DVD is the real gem featuring all four videos (\\"Get Your Number\\" a U.K. single release only) from this record, all of which were excellent, & show that she has become a video artist since (once again...) her \\"Butterfly\\" days in 1997.<br /><br />There was a \\"special edition\\" with a slipcase & foldout poster when the album was released back in April, that could've easily been replaced with this. Then again the videos wouldn't have been included.<br /><br />Good for hardcore fans like myself, casual folks just go for the original version.<br /><br />One a side note, Mariah fans trashing Madonna records...geez. GROW UP.
0553801503|2.0|In the first three novels in this series GRRM showed himself a master of the genre, blending character development and skillful use of language with thrilling and suspenseful plot pacing to produce page-turners that I was simply unable to put down.  In contrast, AFFC just does not manage to hook the reader.    There are too many pages spent on side characters, side scenes, subplots, that ultimately contribute little or nothing to my enjoyment.  Brienne, Dorne, Cersei should all have been condensed or moved \\"off stage\\" into other characters' chapters.  Brienne spent too much time wandering around, and her character is just not interesting enough to warrant chapters of her own.  Dorne is too scattered among different characters to form attachment to any one of them.  Cersei is moderately entertaining as she self-destructs, but she didn't warrant 10 chapters.  Part of what made Cersei an effective villain was her ambiguity; you never knew what wacky nonsense she was up to; with her secrets revealed, the evil allure is gone.    At this stage in the series, I feel GRM should be focusing on main characters.  There are certainly enough loose ends left over from the last book, that he shouldn't be opening multiple new plot threads peripheral to the story.  GRRM's strongest characters were absent from this book, and I've read his explanation for that, but ultimately, all this time spent sidetracked in AFFC detracts from the best part of the series, which lies in Jon, Dany, and Tyrion and the conflict between Ice and Fire.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have had this album since about October 26th.  And it probably hasn't left my CD player since I got it.  \\"I Love New York\\", \\"Hung Up\\", & \\"Jump\\" are among the strongest tracks.  Lady M doesn't quit.  22 Years of Chart History.  Hung Up as her 51st top 40 hit.  Need I say more.  The album will easily debut at #1 on Billboard's 200 Albums and if it doesn't then the whole thing is a scam.  Hung Up has been #1 on the dance chart.  And it is well deserved.  If anyone had any doubts about Madonna's credentials as Queen of Pop.  Or the best female artist in our time, then they are blind.  I don't care how many weeks Mariah has been at #1.  Madonna paved they way for her and the rest of them.  Sure Aretha & Cher were around before her, but they didn't push the women's movement ahead like Madonna.  And Mariah had to fake a nervous breakdown to get people to feel sorry for her, and put her singles in the bargain bin at your local record store to get back on top.  Tragic.  Some people work hard for everything, even after small setbacks like the sales of American Life.  But it was a great album as are all of Madonna's albums.  I hope all the piracy ends in regards to this record.  Any penny you spend on this lady she has worked her ass off and deserves it.  And everyone needs to get themselves a treat for the senses.  This album kicks it into gear.
B000002WPI|5.0|Wow , Thats all i can say when it comes too the Debut of the Wu-Tang Clan in \\"36 Chambers\\" This LP was just Amazing , no exageration , Every single member of this crew can Rap like no other , each member have there own unique style which makes the Wu-Tang Clan so great.

And too this day the best Hip hop rap crew Album off All-Time.<br /><br />Top 5 Trax<br /><br />EVERY SINGLE TRACK ON THIS ALBUM (NO JOKE!)<br /><br />:RIP O.D.B.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After an admirable step forward, which worked in some instances with 2003's \\"American Life\\", Madonna returns, with an eye to the future of pop, & a wink back to her earlier roots.<br /><br />I would describe this album as containing the earlier spirit of Madonna's first pop album \\"Madonna\\", with the sonic sophistication of latter records such as \\"Ray of Light\\". After Mirwais' cold electro-clash arrangements for two records, Madonna brings in Stuart Price who gives the overall record a much denser, surrounding, almost warm (in the vein of William Orbit's production for \\"Ray of Light\\") feel. Anders Bagge, Peer Astrom, Mirwais Ahmadzai, Bloodshy & Avant also lend a helping hand.<br /><br />The tracks are segued which give it a \\"non-stop\\" feel, but each spin reveals gems that definitely rise to surface after repeated listening.<br /><br />The lead single \\"Hung Up\\" a brilliant urgent slice of pop, which samples Abba's \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! A Man After Midnight!\\", for it's melodic hook which plants itself within your mind on the first listen. I found it great that Madonna chose such a lesser-known Abba single to sample, something that only hardcore pop/disco/dance fans would know. Had she used \\"Dancing Queen\\" or \\"Mamma Mia\\", it wouldn't have worked.<br /><br />Other highlights include one Mirwais produced number \\"Future Lovers\\", which finds him giving homage to Giorgo Moroder's & Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\" from Donna's 1977 album \\"I Remember Yesterday\\". Madonna's relaxed, sensual spoken delivery about love over shimmering melodies, we see that this ranks as one of Mirwais' finest productions for Madonna. \\"Push\\", \\"Get Together\\", & \\"Jump\\" recall Madonna's journey through pop since 1983 with dizzying effects.<br /><br />\\"Isaac\\" one of my personal favorites, is named after the male vocalist who chants on the track. In the vein of \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" from \\"Ray of Light\\" Madonna merges the spiritual treks of life with dance again, the results? One word: AWESOME.<br /><br />The record's lyrics work from tongue-in-cheek, \\"I Love New York\\", to her more introspective aspects. These aspects find Madonna still asking whether fame is the key to happiness on tracks such as \\"How High\\" & \\"Let It Will Be\\" the latter succeeding the previously mentioned track. \\"Let It Will Be\\" features a surging string section, that work with Madonna's somber words to deliver an all around tight package.<br /><br />Madonna has once again proven that she is the undisputed Queen of Pop, a title not given lightly. She continues to push the boundaries of mainstream pop & challenges her fans, & most importantly herself. I believe that only Kylie Minogue has come close to Madonna's masterful grasp on the style of pop.<br /><br />\\"Some have called it religion...\\" Madonna spoke of love on \\"Future Lovers\\", so true could be said about Madonna's music.<br /><br />Amen!ove New York\\", to her more introspective aspects.

B000A3DFZE|2.0|The Good<br /><br />There's no shortage of musical styles on Clapton's latest. \\"So Tired\\" is a bouncy, acoustic pop number that has some great slide guitar embellishments. \\"Say What You Will\\" has a reggae influence to it, a la \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\". \\"I'm Going Left\\" left has a percussion heavy gospel tinge. \\"Lost and Found\\" is a pure blues number, right down to the `woe is me' vocals. Clapton has been known more for his ballads as of late then his guitar playing so the inclusion of \\"One Day\\" is a no-brainer. The organ tones compliment the twangy guitar tones and soulful vocals. The album's title track is a mid-tempo blues/country ditty that closes out the disc.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />There's a fine line between blues rock & pop rock, and it seems Clapton has officially crossed over. The music is decent, but rudimentary. We all know Clapton is capable of writing killer riffs and hooks, but on Coming Home he chooses more chord playing and soloing instead.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />I just don't think that Clapton's into writing great riffs and hooks anymore. He seems to be interested in pop-rock compositions that focus more on lyrical content, commercial sound, and guest pop stars. Imagine a full album of songs that sound like \\"Change the World\\", \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", and \\"Tears in Heaven\\". That's Back Home. With his recent reunion gigs with Cream, I think fans would rather hear a full album of songs that sound like \\"Cocaine\\", \\"Layla\\", or even \\"Riding with King\\".
B000BC8TBE|5.0|I come from Shanghai, which she is China's best foreign selling female all the time. I love this x-mas album

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Don't bother reading most of the negative reviews on Amazon for this album...they're all written by the same few people, who are members of the pathetic \\"TeamLamb\\", an organization whose website was \\"dedicated to bringing Madonna down\\" as well as artists such as The Beatles, Barbra Streisand, and Joni Mitchell.  Their website was recently shut-down due to \\"legal issues\\" (i.e. slander) and complaints (i.e., the animation of Madonna being thrown off of, then trampled by, a horse).  Notice how most of these negative reviews basically say the exact same thing, are only two sentences long, and are all posted by members with names like \\"G.G\\" or \\"C.C.\\" or \\"B.B.\\"...they're just trying to get as many \\"one stars\\" out there as possible.    The fact of the matter is that this is a terriffic album, dance or otherwise.  It's fun, catchy, and extermely listenable.  The songs themselves are very rich and have many layers to discover; Madonna and Stuart Price did an excellent job with the production on this CD.  The sound is incredibly fresh and new - very un-like most of the pop / dance music currently on the radio, yet it has just the right hint of \\"now\\" for the mass audience...it is definitely a \\"progressive\\" album that will influence pop & dance music for the next few years.  A must-have for Madonna fans, fans of dance music, or simply anyone who likes really, really good pop music.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|The Good<br /><br />The great thing about a Neil Young record is that you never know what you're going to get. He's done everything from hard rock to rockabilly. Prairie Wind is a mellow, country flavored release. Acoustic finger-picking and layered vocal melodies will draw you into the opening track \\"The Painter\\". \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth\\" slows the pace down to a crawl. Young's patented falsetto rings out from time to time throughout the verses. \\"Far From Home\\" employs a brass section and harmonica to accent its bluesy sound. Young lays down some great guitar slides and bends.<br /><br />\\"It's a Dream\\" is a sad ballad whose tone is enhanced by a soft string arrangement and piano playing. \\"Prairie Wind\\" trots along like a cowboy on his mighty stead. \\"He Was the King\\" is a clever tribute to Elvis Presley. Either Young did his research or he knew the man personally. It's set to a catchy rhythm and has a gospel meets rock warmth to it. The final track \\"When God Made Me\\" is the centerpiece of the entire album. If this one doesn't get you thinking or crying, then you must be dead. Young emits such emotion and intelligence with this one.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Nothing notable.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />I would have liked to have heard a rocker or two, but overall the album is of high Neil Young quality. I've never really thought that Neil Young was a great singer, but he always delivers well-written and thought-provoking lyrics. Prairie Wind will trigger lots of emotions within you; as I'm sure it did for Neil.
0451526384|4.0|All of Jane Austen's heroines are unique in different ways; Emma Woodhouse was rich and had no pressing need to marry; Fanny Price was shy and introverted; Lizzie Bennett was witty and self-mocking; and Elinor Dashwood had to share the spot-light with her younger sister Marianne. Anne Elliot's defining attribute is that she is considerably older than her literary fellows; for at the grand old age of twenty-seven is nearly past her prime (in the eyes of her contemporaries) and entering perpetual spinsterhood. In a time when a woman was defined by her society almost solely on her success in marriage, things are not looking so good for Anne.<br /><br />This is especially bitter for Anne considering she was once in love with the handsome but poor Frederick Wentworth, but persuaded to break relations between them on the advice of her deceased mother's dearest friend Lady Russell, who disapproved the match. Regretting such an action in the years that followed, Anne has almost reconciled herself to a life of maidenhood, surrounded by self-absorbed relatives.<br /><br />However, fate is about to give her a second chance. Set (and written) as the Napoleonic Wars were ending, Anne learns that Captain Wentworth - now a wealthy and respectful officer - is about to re-enter her acquaintance. After her father is forced to rent out their estate in order to pay off debts, Anne travels to Uppercross Cottage to stay with her sister Mary Musgrove, unsettled with the thought that one of the tenants left behind is the sister of Captain Wentworth. Settling in with the Musgroves and the beautiful Henrietta and Louisa (Mary's sister-in-laws), it is only a matter of time before Mr Musgrove returns with Captain Wentworth in tow.<br /><br />Anne is understandably nervous given their unhappy parting, but forces herself to remain calm and polite in his presence - and to her sorrow he behaves the same toward her, focusing his attention on the Musgrove girls. To stir things up a bit, Anne also meets her estranged cousin Mr Elliot, who is immensely attentive and charming toward her and almost certainly intends to make her his wife.<br /><br />Anne herself is neither pretty nor witty; rather she's patient, kind-hearted, sensible and part of a family that doesn't deserve her. It's not that her father and sisters are unkind, but one can feel Anne's discontent and loneliness in being part of a family that places importance only on riches and rank without any conception that their minds are weak and uninformed. As the only sensible person in a world of self-absorption, Anne trudges through her duties unnoticed and uncomplaining. But she's not perfect, for every reader knows that she's made a mistake in giving up the love of her life (though she comes to a surprising conclusion concerning it in the last chapter, placing her duty to society and family above the demands of her own heart), and as Frederick and Anne dance around each other, hopelessly trapped by the silence that conformity demands, the modern reader will share their frustration in their inability to speak their minds, especially in a world where there are no such restrictions.<br /><br />But of course, this is an Austen book and you don't have to be physic to know that a happy resolution is on its way - but the way in which it is settled is perhaps Austen's most touching union between two characters, made even more poignant by the fact that that it's taken them two tries to find one another. One feels especially happy for Anne, who truly deserves some joy in her life - her reaction to the warmth of the Musgroves' familial life is heartrending when you realise her surprise and appreciation for it is caused by the lack of such warmth in her own family.<br /><br />\\"Persuasion\\" is the shortest of all Austen's novels, as well as the last one she wrote before her death, which should appeal to those who are a bit stretched for time. It's not her best, most beloved or most famous novel, as many of the character simply aren't as vivid or involving as some of her other novels, but it contains the same themes of social commentary, verbal wit and wry insights into the human condition that Austen is famous for. A sweet, slim novel about loyal, love and second chances.of the character simply aren't as vivid or involving as some of her other novels, but it contains the same themes of social commentary, verbal wit and wry insights into the human condition that Austen is famous for.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is just great. All of the songs are gonna make you dance.<br /><br />Hung Up - One of the best tracks in the album. 8/10<br /><br />Get Together - My favorite.

I love the lyrics! 9/10<br /><br />Isaac - WOW! 10/10<br /><br />Push - The closest the album gets do R&B. 9/10<br /><br />Like It Or Not - Normal song. 7/10<br /><br />Overall I give this album a 9. It's VERY good, worth buying and it's Madonna's best album to date.
B0006Z2LH4|5.0|The story continues with more people stuck in a Cube-like prison, but is that all? No. We actually learn that there are workers watching the prisoners in the Cube. Until one of the workers realize that there is an innocent woman stuck in the Cube. Will he stay on the evil side or will he join the good side with the prisoners? Cube was one of the most intelligent thrillers ever made, with interesting characters, awesome gore and well crafted suspense. I gave that a 10. Cube 2 was nothing. It takes a good premise (eight strangers stuck in a hypercube) but adds this alternate universe crap, with unoriginal traps, annoying characters, insulting ending and badly done CGI. In fact, too much badly done CGI. I gave that a 3 because that are some good points. The rooms are nice and the music score is not bad, but that doesn't save the movie from becoming total trash. Cube Zero is different. It wants you to ignore Cube 2 and shows you what made the original worked; suspense, good characters, well done effects and awesome gore. There are new traps this time; Acid, wires, a flesh-eating virus, sonic weapon, freezing ice and of course, a room that vaporizes the victim. Now then, the characters are very interesting. For once, you can care for the characters now. You can even feel sad for the victims that are about to die. The main character, Eric Wynn, is awesome. Of course, he's not one of the participants, but rather one of the people who watches the Cube. He has no choice, but to rescue one of the participants of the Cube. Now I heard the character Jax was supposed to be a comedy relief. To me, he was more of a psychopath than a comedy relief, but he did had some funny moments. The direction from first-timer Ernie Barbarash (who wrote and produced Cube 2) got the tone just right. He went back to what worked in the first one and add the old, dark rusty rooms (Hey, I thought the rooms in Cube 2 was alright, but did they think that it would beat the rooms in the original?). Another thing is that instead of CGI gore, the make-up for gore effects is back. I'm glad he went back to the make-up basics instead of crappy CGI. His story was cool as well. As you can see, Ernie is the writer here. No one else, but him. I love the way he explained the Cube mythology. He should make more movies in the future because this film proved that he is a good filmmaker. Overall, I had a great time watching this. It was a fantastic effort to the Cube mythology and I hope to see more in the future. But also, I can't wait til they explain about the building of the Cube. <br /> <br />Acting: 9/10: Zachary Bennett (Eric) does a great job as the main character with a nice touch of realism. Stephanie Moore (Rains) did a fine job here. She may not be the next Leaven, but she's still awesome to me. David Hubband (Dodd) was another winner, with his good character and a fine performance. <br /> <br />Gore Factor: 10/10: WHOAH!!! This was gorier than 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'The Devil's Rejects' put together. Another f#cking winner. <br /> <br />T&A: 0/10: None, but it didn't need any. <br /> <br />Direction: 10/10: Ernie Barbarash did a great job here with a fascinating storyline, well-crafted suspense, a few good scares and adding lots of awesome gore. I love it. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: Fans of the first Cube, this is the movie you've been waiting for. The movie that explains it all. It may be more questions than answers, but this is what Cube is about; Mystery solving, how the Cube works. Now I know this comment may not be useful, but this is how the movie was supposed to be; a well crafted experience of the first Cube, an extremely intelligent movie instead of CGI filled crap. But you'll probably find is not useful because, obviously, you like Cube 2 more than the first and this movie. Now on to the end comment of the movie. A well done prequel that succeeds the first and ignoring the second. Bring on Cube: Trespassed.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|Come on, this album was released three times.<br /><br />Buy Confessions on a Dance Floor by Madonna instead.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ever since her debut album in `83 -- which I originally bought because it was produced by Reggie Lucas (I had no idea who the singer was) -- I've watched Madonna's career go through more ups and downs than interest rates.  After 1998's RAY OF LIGHT (IMHO her best album), I was beginning to wonder if she had any more ups left in her, despite a few good post-Y2K cuts here and there.   <br /> <br />With CONFESSIONS, UP she goes!  Although ROL is still #1 on my list, CONFESSIONS looks like it's going to solidly settle into the #2 spot.  In a move quite unique for a mainstream artist, Madonna has allowed her latest set of tracks to be compiled into a non-stop mix ... as a FIRST step in presenting this music to the public, rather than a later one.  Any of the few lapses in the lyrics that others have mentioned are minor and overshadowed by the contemporary electronica/dance sounds that at times recall disco's golden age (an ABBA sample, Donna Summer/Giorgio Moroder influences), but not to the point where the album sounds like a throwback to the past.  Any such classic elements are boomeranged via the fresh production back to 2005.   <br /> <br />Also important to CONFESSIONS' success is that Madonna's attractive vocals don't get lost in a sea of beats and electronics.  If you've liked the sound of her voice in the past, you'll be happy with it here, too.  Even if the music is dance-oriented, there is plenty of room for Madonna's vocals to take center stage.  I would expect that most -- not all, obviously -- fans of previous Madonna CDs from any point in her career will find a lot to like here.
B00005R1N3|5.0|\\"Black Christmas\\" is probably the best film among the slasher genre that I have ever seen. I'm absolutely amazed that this film is not more widely known. \\"Black Christmas\\" is permeated throughout with one of the eeriest, creepiest atmospheres ever seen in any film before as well as one of the most disturbing twists at the ending. This movie makes Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" look like a film made for children. Definitely worth watching for any fan of horror films, I  rate this one up with better known classics such as \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\" A truly frightening film.

B000BJS4OY|5.0|If you like Bruce then you already have this, know what it means and understand. If you're thinking about getting this then don't think twice it's alright. If you are not interested then how comes you've read this much already!? The album easily stands the test of time. It is quite simply the essence of what rock'n'roll music is all about. The passion, innocence and power of the songs still have an enormous effect on me 30 years later. I had tears in my eyes by the end of Thunder Road and was walking on air at the end of Jungleland. In 1975 rock music had lost it's spark and passion. It was treading water. What most people don't understand is that this album woke the whole industry and record buying public up. The hype that followed was incredible but not Springsteen's doing. The fact that 30 years later he is still such a major important artist says everything about his character and talent. The Hammersmith show? I WAS THERE! It changed my life. I had never understood how powerful music could be. I was 21. Had seen the Beatles at the same venue! But this was unbelievable stuff. Nobody in those days moved around the stage like he did, orchestrated a band like he did and wrote the songs he was writing. The interaction between band members was fantastic and noone else had it. To be able to see the show 30 years later means so much. I ask any fan of rock music to buy this set. If you're not sure what to expect then great. You will be amazed. I haven't even had time to watch the Wings For Wheels doc. That's for tonight. This is what it is all about. 5 stars is nowhere near enough!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is beyond all expectations!!  Easily her best album since Ray of Light, Madonna takes her 20 years of evolution and projects it 20 years into the future.  Every single track is so heavily layered with samples and beats it will make your head spin!  It's hard to pick a fave, but I'm sticking with \\"Sorry\\" at the moment.  This CD is a must have!!
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|Walt Disney's \\"SKY HIGH\\" starring Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston is an excellent movie for the entire family to watch and rewatch with your kids, not only for the great storyline, slapstick comedy, requisite pretty girls and usual teen angst, but more importantly, for the film's message that true friends will never let you down, they are there when you least expect it, through \\"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\\" and will always lift you up whenever you need encouragement. I know this because it has been such a major factor in my own life (long story...and I don't think anyone would care to read it, so I'll keep silent on the details).<br /><br />Watch for a cameo by Lynda Carter (best-known for starring in the 1970's TV show \\"Wonder Woman\\"; fans of the show and those who've heard of it will recognize her immediately) as the school principal. Newcomer Michael Angarano, Danielle Panabaker, the lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead and the rest of the cast, which includes Dave Foley (voice of Flick in Disney/Pixar's smash hit \\"A Bug's Life\\") and Cloris Leachman (\\"Young Frankenstein\\") turn in impressive performances. Rated PG for mild action violence.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Where to begin?<br /><br />the album stands in its own right as the pure experience of music it was and it is now still. Really, it's hard to believe this is the same guy wearing bandanas and looking all pumped up ten years later.<br /><br />The documentary is interesting; no real surprises, other than learning most of the songs were composed on piano.<br /><br />Then the Hammersmith concert! This is incredible live experience and a testament to the singer's ability to change phrasing, to communicate the love for the music always sounding fresh: such passion for the music is not commony found I suppose: even Bruce himself falls short now in comparison.<br /><br />(songs: Thunder Road; Spirit in the night; I'ts hard to be a saint in the city; Kitty's back; Backstreets, etc...)
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle (1971.), Pink Floyd's sixth studio album<br /><br />Pink Floyd, over their long and varied career, have proven themselves to be classic/progressive rock legends. In the latter half of the 1960's, when Pink Floyd first appeared on the music scene, they amazed listeners with their unique and off-the-wall style of psychadelic rock. Following a number of successful albums, including their great debut in 'The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn', the band began to look for new styles. This was first seen with their 1970 album 'Atom Heart Mother' but more so with this album 'Meddle'. When people think of the classic sound that Pink Floyd had, they think of the music the band put out in the 1970's. 'Meddle' is regarded by many as the first album that explored this progressive style. So how good does this album measure up to be?<br /><br />'Meddle for me, is the album where the band really began to find their niche. This is the start of where the band's music really comes together - not to say that their earlier efforts aren't good - the early psychedelic albums are great but you sense that the band hadn't quite found their assured sound. 'Meddle' therefore, is the transitional album for the band and sadly because of this, the work often gets ignored in the wake of the mammoth follow up albums, 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and 'Wish You Were Here'. Given that these are perhaps the band's two best albums, it is not surprising that this album does fall in their shadows but it doesn't change the fact that this is still an awesome effort. What shouldn't be dismissed is that this album features 'Echoes; I'll mention more about it later but this IS the band's epic song and is one of their best. At half the album's length it is worth the CD's price alone. Similarly, there are classic sounding Pink Floyd tracks such as 'One Of These Days' which stand up there with great songs on their other classic albums. You can sense when listening to the album that the band are much more assured in what they are doing. The song writing is much more cohesive than on previous albums. Also the song structures make more sense than on the earlier stuff; although that's not to say the songs are simpler - Pink Floyd never follow simple song formats. Instrumentally, the band are on top form. Dave Gilmour jams out some great guitar sections and Roger Waters' bass line is assured. Rick Wright adds in plenty of keyboard effects and some clever experimental fills. Nick Mason's drumming, albeit laid back gives the ideal beat and feel to the music. The musical focus on the album was, at the time of the album's release, their best and was the ideal platform for later work.<br /><br />The layout of the album follows an unusual format, given that the second half of the work is just the one song. Side 1 of the original LP though, is a collection of 5 songs, some great, others a bit experimental and artful. The first of these is one of the band's classic efforts 'One Of These Days'. The opening whirling, windy effect is magnificent and paves the way for a gentle rolling riff from Gilmours guitar. The track gathers momentum with some clever surprise moments, perhaps the best one being when Mason, whose voice was distorted by effects murmurs 'One Of These Days I'm Going To Cut You Into Little Pieces', before an energetic surge in the music. Following this great opener is the more easy going 'Pillow Of Winds'. This song is much more acoustic with plenty of winding sections held together by some great vocals form Gilmour. 'Fearless' is next. A tranquil guitar riff again calls this one home and the 'You'll Never Walk Alone' overdub at the end of the track is an interesting addition. Next, for a more lighter and chilled out song, we have 'San Tropez'. This song is pretty funny to listen to, with an almost jazzy feel to it. Then, to round off side one we have 'Seamus'. This two minute song, written about Steve Marriott's dog is a bit weird, but still a humorous listen. A bit blues styled, the track incorporated plenty of dog barks and howls throughout.<br /><br />Then we come to the second half of the album. At 23 minutes, 'Echoes' is probably one of the longest album songs ever made. Only Pink Floyd could create a masterpiece at this length. It never gets boring or lets up an inch; this for me is perhaps the band's greatest ever song and perhaps my personal favourite epic of all time. This is the classic Floyd sound exhibition. Echoing, nautical sounds open the album with a suspicious feel and slowly the music begins to gather texture and style. Some of the lyrics are the band's best during this song, each time followed by a classic descending guitar line from Gilmour. The middle part of the song is especially great; a long section of wailing guitar exchanges with clever keyboard fills gets suddenly fazed out and then there is a tense section of more echoes. You almost feel the music wanting to burst out at you; there is so much pent up energy in tis section. Then suddenly, the music gives and there is a dreamy guitar section followed by an atmospheric verse and then a controlled but hair-raising finish with ascending wails. This track is awesome; my words can't do it justice!<br /><br />Overall, 'Meddle' was the birth of the most successful part of the band's career. Although not quite 5 star material overall, due to a few weak areas on the first half of the album, the all-time epic 'Echoes' is a winner for this album. This album is indeed the building block and more than deserving predecessor to 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and deserves plenty of praise. Any fan wanting more of the 'classic' Floyd sound of the 1970's should definitely invest in this great album.<br /><br />MY RATING: 8.5/10plenty of dog barks and howls throughout.

B00006RCSR|5.0|Andy Tennant's retelling of the classic Cinderella story by the Brothers Grimm (no pun intended on the movie of the same name) is a classic period film. Drew Barrymore (\\"E.T.\\") is still impressive and beautiful as Danielle, a young girl in 17th century France who inadvertently catches the attention of the crown prince (Dougray Scott) while slaving away for her evil stepmother (Academy Award winner Angelica Huston). An awesome score by George Fenton (who would reunite with Andy Tennant to score \\"Anna And The King,\\" a non-musical version of the classic Rodgers&Hammerstein musical \\"The King And I,\\" with Tennant again behind the director's chair). This is one of my all-time favorite period movies. I fell in love with Ms. Barrymore when I saw the promotional advertising for this movie; I was 8 years old at the time...and I fell in love all over again at 19.  Rated PG for some thematic elements and mild language.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is among Madonna's finest recordings. Lush stringe interwoven with tribal and pounding drum beats.... <br /> <br />I don't understand how anyone could *not* love this album.  <br /> <br />Bravo Madonna. ***** stars!
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon (1973.), Pink Floyd's eighth studio album<br /><br />There has never been and never will be a band quite like Pink Floyd. Over their extensive career, the prog. rock quartet of Dave Gilmour (guitar), Roger Waters (bass), Rick Wright (keyboards) and Nick Mason (drums) have made a legendary contribution to rock music (I've also not forgotten original frontman Syd Barratt in that list). The band tried out more than their fair share of new ideas and in many ways paved the way in pushing the boundaries of music. All of the band's albums are quite popular, but none more so than 'Dark Side Of The Moon' which is heralded as the Floyd's greatest work and one of the greatest albums of all time. This album has shifted more units than any other rock album ever made (sales are over 40 millions units I think!). So is this album really deserving of its great popularity and also, why is it just that bit special?<br /><br />For me, there is no question, this is Pink Floyd's ultra-definitive album and also their finest album - other hardcore Floyd fans may disagree and choose 'Wish You Were Here' or 'The Wall' by preference but I think that this tops them both. Pink Floyd, up to this point had amazingly demonstrated their great potential, none more so than in their great 1971 release, 'Meddle'. With that album, you could sense that the band were on the brink of producing a true masterpiece and here you have it, the ultimate masterpiece from the band in 'Dark Side Of The Moon'. Everything comes together on this album; the songs run cohesively and perfectly from one to the next and the songwriting is literally awesome. It should come as no surprise that all of the band members had songwriting inputs on the album (rather than the sole Waters dominance that would come in later albums) and this further demonstrates why this album is so good. It often amazes me that there are people around today who are more than willing to bash this album. I constantly hear comments such as 'It sounds dated' or 'This music makes me fall asleep'. These people (probably listeners to senseless nu metal, emo crap or anything else thats abysmal in music in recent times) never fail to amaze me; I don't know what stuff they must be on to make them so diluded! At my last check, this album was made over 30 years ago ... YES 30 YEARS. People are quick to diss the techniques that Pink Floyd used on this album to make various effects but at the time it was completely new and revolutionary - they didn't have the latest digital recording studio to help them out! That aside, the various styles the band use on the album for me still sound fantastic and fresh. Gilmour's guitar work is first rate, as are his vocals. Waters' bass play is beautifully resonant throughout and the keyboard work by Wright is fantastic. With that all aside, it is the lyrical concept that really makes this album so good. Pink Floyd take you through an amazing conceptual journey on this album, and one that you never tire of. The all too realisitic themes of loss of time, war, madness and death are in this album. The band tackle a whole load of themes in this 40 minute album; you can't not be emotionally moved by it. This is why the album has appealed to so many over time; the album's concept driven, experimental but ultimately polished and structured style is what makes it shine so much. The album has so many sides to it and you notice something new with every listen. Who also could miss the cover; the prism effect front is simple but an amazing eye-catcher.<br /><br />The journey of the 'Dark Side Of The Moon' begins with opener 'Speak To Me/Breathe'. The opening part of the song opens up with a showcase of the effects to come; mad voices, a woman screaming, cash tills and everything else all cleverly mix together (note all the voices you hear on the album were workers at the recording studio who had their reponses recorded when they were asked about madness). This then runs into the start of the proper music, firstly with the classic guitar and bass line for the album followed by a couple of verses of harsh and brutal lyrics. 'On The Run', is a clever track with a racing electronic sound which was created by speeding a note sequence on a tape loop - there's plenty more effects added in on this track. Then we come to the album's first epic in 'Time'. A surpise entrance of ringing bells kick starts this one. Gilmour's crunching guitar chords alongside some echoing drumming give this song an atmospheric build up. This then becomes a lyrically amazing song, with themes on time slipping away and growing old. Gilmour's guitar solo is brilliant; as is the 'Breathe' (reprise) song exit. Following this great track is the closing song for side one with 'Great Gig In The Sky'. Rick Wright's gentle piano chords are superbly contrasted by the passionate, emotional and evocative wails by singer Clair Torry, who the band hired for the song. The song is like nothing I've heard before.<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with the album's most famous song. Who could fail to recognise the unique cash-machine sounds at the start of the song. Rhythmically, this song is weird as it is written in 7/4 time, as opposed to the 4/4 standard. However, this time signature paves the way for the songs classic bass line. The lyrics, based around corporate wealth, greed and acquisition are classic, as is the middle section with plenty of roaring guitars. 'Us And Them' follows; perhaps the album's most heartfelt song. Based on the theme of outrage at the continuation of the Vietnam war, this song is powerful. The keyboard work is imaginitive and the saxophone solo is brilliant. 'Any Colour You Like' is next. This one is experimental where Gilmour tries his hand at some quirky guitar play over some great keyboard dubs. The madness theme of 'Brain Damage' is next up which looks at the mental damage caused to war casualties. This is another foreboding song with a brutal and realistic edge. Finally, to close this epic album is 'Eclipse'. A short, punchy finish with plenty of contrasting lyrics building to a climax. The heartbeat at the end cleverly trails the album to a finish, in the style just like it began.<br /><br />'Dark Side Of The Moon' is an epic musical journey through the tragedies of life. Pink Floyd were at their absolute peak with this album and the work is never short of inspired moments. This album is perfect; everything comes together both musically and lyrically. Plenty of people have this album but still, if you don't then this is a MUST buy. This album is not just the place to begin a Pink Floyd collection, it is the place to begin a good music collection in general. Trust me, and all the other high rated reviews for this album, this album is well worth the money you will pay for it and the time you will spend listening to it! (excuse the puns!)<br /><br />EXTRA NOTE: 'Dark Side Of The Moon' was issued in an SACD format some time ago. If you have the technology for SACD formats then this is the version you may want to get. I personally don't know what the quality is like with that version and I've heard a mixture of positive and negative feedback alike about it.<br /><br />MY RATING: 10/10; a classic that rises above the restfirstly with the classic guitar and bass line for the album followed by a couple of verses of harsh and brutal lyrics.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|The songs from their last album had no titles, the record before that was promoted with a video featuring dancing Down's Syndrome sufferers and this release was forebodingly titled Final Album on early promotional copies sent to media. Iceland's Sigur Ros could never be accused of following an orderly routine, but were Takk to actually signal their imminent demise then what a breathtaking way in which to bow out. Takk once again finds the Arctic-dwelling post-rock outfit wrapping up their conjectural muse within a special package - this time taking on a bookish form even more elaborate than Radiohead's similar Amnesiac project. Featuring elaborate line drawings, embossed leaves and delicate stencils, Sigur Ros's arty sleeve design is a fine fit for their provocative, inspiring and exhilarating music.  <br />While Jonsi Birgisson's lyrics remain as intangible and confounding as the Australian public's love of Rove McManus, the delicate and graceful sounds of Takk are at their best when absorbed as a whole. Listening to a single Sigur Ros album tune is akin to only watching 10 minutes of Citizen Kane - it's a grand masterpiece there to be worshipped in its entirety, not in brief flashes.  <br />The repeated phrases and cyclical effects of () are present yet less obvious this time around, instead replaced by horns on Saeglopur, upbeat moments on Anduari and more commercial possibilities than previous outings. When the final note of closer Heysatan rings out, there remains an air of expectation that something will follow. Although a postscript never arrives, Takk hopefully only closes the latest Sigur Ros chapter rather than marking the conclusion of the Icelandic post-rockers' whole book.
B00005JG6Q|3.0|I'll keep this short and sweet I have only found 2 film whose 'Special Edition' or 'Director's cut' was actually better than ther original Aliens and Terminator 2- other than that they have each diminished the original.  I feel this new translation of Akira falls in step with the masses.  While the original version of Akira is one of my all time favourite movies this new signature series leaves much to be desired.  The new transaltion deviates wildly from the original I have on Laserdisc  and in my opinion weakens the story quite a bit.  the voice actors don't seem to have the same energy as the original.  Now I don't speak Japanese but eve the subtitled transaltions is slightly different. I'm not thrilled withit but Like star wars if you want it on DVD it is the only game in town
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I became a huge Madonna fan back in the nineties with the release of Ray of Light. Her albums following it were mediocre at best and I was, sad to say, losing faith in her after her stint with Britney; however, she has truly come back to form with Confessions. Upon my first listen I was taken back. The album is unbelievable. The basslines are thumping, brilliant acoustics, well written, thought provoking lyrics, and out of this world beats. My ratings of the songs:  <br /> <br />Hung Up: 5/5. Understandably the first single off the album. Hung up is sort of an introduction to the melody of the rest of the album. A great song for dance lovers. <br /> <br />Get Together: 5/5. Kylie-ish type song. Reminds me a lot of In YOur Eyes off Fever. But great upbeat song that will lift your spirits.  <br /> <br />Sorry: 5/5. Starts off sorta slow but then really catches up with the speed of the rest of the album. Great self proclamation song.  <br /> <br />Future Lovers: 5/5. Reminds me a lot of the Justify My Love era. Great song altogether, hopefully she will make a edge of your seat video to go with the single that will be banned from MTV.  <br /> <br />I Love New York: 4/5. Okay song, more filler. Sounds like she was just trying something different on this track. <br /> <br />Let It Will Be: 5/5. One of my 3 favorite tracks on the album. Great song!!! <br /> <br />Forbidden Love: 5/5. Nothing like the Bedtime Stories Forbidden Love. A little bit slower than the rest of the album, but by the time it arrives it's well needed.  <br /> <br />Jump: 5/5. Another of my 3 favorite tracks. Real upbeat, just all around a great track with a hella good baseline & tempot. Jump is an off the wall song that takes you by surprise, the song is a ride within itself.  <br /> <br />How High: 5/5. The third of my favorite tracks on the album. Examines the worth of it all. Another thought provoking track that shows her versatility with both lyrics and beats.  <br /> <br />Isaac: 5/5. Shanti/Ashtangi like song. Her salute to Kabbalah. Really interesting song though with some deep lyrics. But even ignoring the lyrics and all else, if you just pay attention to only the beat, the song is still amazing.  <br /> <br />Push: 3/5. My least favorite song on the album. There's just too much going on on the track. It will probably grow on me. The beat is just a bit much even after a few listens. <br /> <br />Like It Or Not: 5/5. Another song about triumph. A great way to end the album.  <br /> <br />Overall, Madonna truly out did herself on this album. With the release of her last two albums she definitely had something to prove on Confessions and she without a doubt proves her point: Even aside Kylie, she can still release an amazing album that reiterates her standins as a Queen of Pop. If you've liked any of Madonna's albums ever, this one is definitely one to collect. Grammy time will definitely be hers.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Madonna appears damn confident that Confessions On A Dance Floor is the hottest dance album she's created in her three decades of recording. The accompanying press release for the record finds the 47-year-old brashly remarking \\"I want people to jump out of their seats!\\", yet the only time listeners will abide will be when they're getting up and turning off the stereo upon realisation that Confessions On A Dance Floor is one of Madonna's weakest releases ever.   <br />She's racked up 200 million albums, almost 50 Top 40 singles and 20 MTV Awards, so why does Madonna's Confessions On A Dance Floor fail to engage listeners to the level of her earlier successes? It seems that by calculatedly creating a dance album where each track segues into the next, the variety exuded by her finest albums Like A Prayer, Ray of Light and Music has been dismissed in favour of releasing an album that soon becomes stale and samey. <br />The ABBA-pilfering hook, sublime vocal layers and Visage bassline of Hung Up were an awesome introduction to Confessions On A Dancefloor, proving to be Madonna's hottest lead-off single for an album since Frozen pre-empted Ray Of Light in 1998. Unfortunately, apart from the multilingual throb of Sorry, the slinky groove of Push and the Giorgio Moroder electro undulations of Future Lovers, the album is a disappointing shadow of Miss Ciccone's greatest moments. <br />How High reuses her string arrangements from Die Another Day and combines them with an intro that sounds eerily like Lipps Inc's Funky Town, while Get Together could worryingly pass as a limp remix of The Spice Girls' 2 Become 1. Worst of all is I Love New York, where Madonna's lyrical use of the word dork ensures it usurps her use of the line `feeling super-duper' in her American Life rap while simultaneously delivering another ingratiating US city song. <br />Madonna remains a music icon rightly deified for her pop nous, marketing skills and progressive attitude, but her latest album fails tore-establish her position after American Life saw her stumble. Sorry Madonna, but your latest music won't make the people come together.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I personally enjoyed the American Life Album, although the title track was weak there were some great songs, Hollywood, Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails...so to read every review about how horribly that album did and how different this one is had me a little worried, I could give a care how well it does commercially and how many it sells etc as long as I like it.  And boy do I ever...I cant get past track 3 at the moment , very infectious indeed,  it'll be a single for sure.  One line in I love New York makes me cringe but other than that, its f'in brilliant.  BUY THIS CD.
0553212540|3.0|The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.<br /><br />The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.<br /><br />I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna is back with a new CD, and it's one big dance mix.  Taking a cue from deejays around the world, she provides one continuous set which has no pausing for a breath.  This is going to kill in the clubs, be a great companion on the iPod at the gym, and will be permanently stuck in several Mini-Cooper CD players in the part of town where all the florists and hair dressers live.  If you like the single \\"Hung Up\\" then CONFESSIONS ON A DANCEFLOOR will satisfy you.  The album moves through a bunch of chirpy dance tunes that pay homage to the greats of the genre - Kraftwerk, Donna Summer, ABBA, and New Order.<br /><br />You have to take it for what it is - a dance record.  It's not a deep meditation on motherhood like RAY OF LIGHT, it's not an anti-war and spiritual sermon like AMERICAN LIFE, and it's not the shock treatment of EROTICA.  It's simply a groove that lasts an hour.  The lyrics aren't very confessional, they're not meant to be.  This record only has one aim - to get you dancing.  In that it succeeds.<br /><br />Esther can still get in the groove, and she's got nothing to prove.

B00005JO17|2.0|CHICKEN LITTLE rehashes WAR OF THE WORLDS and INDEPENDENCE DAY giving it a slight twist using barn animals instead of humans.  Nothing new here. WARNER BROTHERS should sue DISNEY for character infringment too. Doesn't the title character \\"Chicken Little\\" look uncannily like EGGHEAD JR., one of the supporting characters from Warner Bros/Looney Toons FOGHORN LEGHORN cartoon series?

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have been super excited about this album for MONTHS, and it's FINALLY HERE! Madonna certainly did not disappoint her fans. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is strictly a dance album: there are no angry ballads here (unlike \\"American Life,\\" which was a good album but slightly disappointed fans who were expecting something entirely different). Every single song on this CD is FABULOUS! There's \\"Hung Up,\\" which has been rocking the airwaves for weeks, but there's also the modish \\"Get Together,\\" the throbbing \\"Future Lovers,\\" and \\"Like It or Not,\\" a sultry vamp in which Madge puts all her critics in their place (again). \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a mix of techno, dance, soul, rave, funk, and even a little disco, and it WORKS! Madonna can make ANYTHING work...that's why she's the Queen of Music! This album is a lot of fun and shows how Madonna's music has evolved and matured over time, but proves that she can still get in touch with the teenage diva she used to be. I think the new CD builds on everything Madonna did in \\"Music\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" and takes her talents to an even higher level. Rock on! (...)
B000AM6MKU|5.0|This movie was excellent in the theater.  The scene where the train goes over the mountain and makes you feel like you are in the movie was great!  This is a great family movie in light of the kind of garbage they are coming out with lately.  To those who have seen this movie and did not like it, they must have skipped child hood and gone straight to grumpy old geezer.  I highly recomend this movie to anyone.
B0007OCG56|5.0|This film was poorly advertised when it hit the theatres last year, which is probably why I didn't see it when it came out. All of the promotions made it look like just another Adam Sandler comedy, which is fine and dandy, but I usually don't shell out the money to see Adam Sandler's movies in the theatre. However, \\"Spanglish\\" is so completely different from anything Sandler has ever done before. It's a comedy and a drama that will make you laugh and cry, and I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Sandler actually has more of a supporting role in \\"Spanglish.\\" The story revolves around a woman and her daughter who emigrate to the United States from Mexico. Flor (Paz Vega)  speaks no English but is determined to build a good life for her daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce). She accepts a housekeeping job at the home of a dysfunctional couple (Sandler and Tea Leoni, who gives an excellent performance as Sandler's crazy, selfish wife). Flor must contend with her new employer's hostility toward her own family and her unwanted influence on Christina. \\"Spanglish\\" is a heartwarming movie about love, family, and responsibility. It was a thousand times better than I expected it to be, and I suggest that everyone watch it! (The only thing I didn't like about the film is that the movie is so open-ended. What happens with John and Deb?! Inquiring minds want to know!)
B000001G5H|5.0|I'd imagine that anyone serious about the solo piano repertoires owns several recordings of these Etudes and probably has given Mr. Pollini's at least a spin. If you're new to this, Pollini has a substantial reputation as a pianist and many of his other recordings have garnered praise. Judging from the hubbub here with these reviews you'll quickly learn that there are two teams battling around this composer, and they tend to represent emotion versus intellect. This is a tough issue with Chopin as the composer himself gave indications he wanted to be considered a \\"classical\\" (that's \\"intellectual\\" but even that's questionable) composer. Some of this music, played \\"classically\\" may have struck his contemporaries as romantic nontheless. It's all discussions about angels dancing on heads of pins. <br /> <br />Some think Pollini's approach is too intellectual, meaning he downplays the schmaltz...perhaps, I'm never sure. OK, these are not the dreamiest performances maybe--I wouldn't use them for a hot-tub seduction--but they're really spectacular anyway; his technique is incredible. The first Etude that one reviewer here hated took my breathe away with its precision and dramatic sweep. The rest of the disc is great. I think anyone new to this music would be very happy with this disc. <br /> <br />What's bugging me these days about what we're doing here, and why I think I'll bag out of doing it anymore, is that, well, on one hand we've got Pollini, a world-renowned pianist who is known for his interpretive thoughfulness and Frederic Chopin who seems to be widely regarded as a composer of top notch music. Then there's me--a complete nobody with a PC and an internet connection--and some guy from East Butthead, and some other guy from Nowheresville, all pontificating on a great pianist and a great composer like we're some sort of world-class experts, which none of us really can be because this isn't a science. It's mostly opinion and history has shown that even \\"expert\\" opinion is often badly skewed. Just ruminate on all the advanced degree holders in Germany who thought Hitler was a whiz-bang. <br /> <br />This music is supposed to be entertaining, it should be fun, it should enrich our lives. It's not tasteless low-fat ice cream, or soy milk, or daily exercise. The whole classical music shtick has been weighted down by over-opinionated students and grumpy over-opinionated middle-aged men who seem to think that there's only one way to do something--reminds me of a pig-headed uncle I once had, the sort of guy who used only one--the correct--pattern to mow the lawn. Sometimes I think we should just watch for mediocrity (and even that's a matter of opinion) or plain old incompetence. My view is that it's just best to share what we think is special; share our enthusiasm for a piece, a performance, and ditch the portentious mudslinging. Sadly, most of these recordings we crank about probably won't even be in print in ten years.  <br /> <br />Maybe,hopefully, some future generation will rediscover all this great music, see it fresh, and bring the sense of awe and wonder back to it that it deserves.
0393327655|4.0|Passing in Review<br /><br />\\"The End of Faith:  Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason\\" by Sam Harris<br /><br />Review by M. Vince Turner<br /><br />November 2005<br /><br />Author Sam Harris takes a no-holds-barred assault on religion in his book The End of Faith.<br /><br />Harris' assault is, however, is not vindictive.  Like a finely sighted assault weapon, Harris picks his targets carefully and hits a bull's eye with each salvo against organized religion and the le-gions that come together to form organized religion.  Christians, Jews and Muslims do not es-cape his sights.  Harris takes on this subject with righteous aplomb, ripping away the veil of sanctimonious cover that has shielded each religious sect so affectively for too long.<br /><br />As an ordained minister, I found much of The End of Faith right on target.  Harris elaborates myriad aspects of organized religion that have come to make too much religion the enemy of God rather than being the advocate of God among groups that lay strong claim to \\"their\\" God.<br /><br />At times Harris applies near-surgical skill, pulling away the cancerous flesh that clothes so much of religion today and he shows how religious praxis has created too much harm in this world and how religion continues to do so.  The End of Faith is not a book that will be well-received by the self-righteous Christians, so many of whom assert \\"their\\" God is the only God and that their \\"God\\" accepts only certain people or certain groups within this cosmos we call Earth.<br /><br />That is not to suggest I agree with every thing Harris writes, but I admit to agreeing or concur-ring with a larger portion of this book.  Harris stresses the importance and significance of spiri-tuality and mysticism, which in Christian faith is where the heart of Jesus of Nazareth fully re-sides.  Harris challenges the notion that the Christian God is better than the Muslim God, or the Jewish God trumps the others or is trumped by the others.  The sacredness of God is dimin-ished by the ways Holy Scripture is misinterpreted in order to meet and support political objec-tives and ends.  Which among us truly holds possession of the \\"right\\" God?<br /><br />Harris points without timidity at how the God of Muslims is violent and how Muslims put that violent God into action.  Yet, Christians are called to face that same ferocity of God as practiced in modern day America.  They are then challenged to ask themselves if this is really the way \\"their/our\\" God wants us to act.  No one's God gets off Scot-free in The End of Faith.<br /><br />The End of Faith will get little support from those Christian groups today who see America as God's chosen nation, God's new empire.  The End of Faith will raise the ire and hackles of those who believe they have all the right answers, unwilling to be open to other points of view.<br /><br />The sad tale of the Sadducees and the Pharisees of Jesus' time is resurrected, and we see those sects alive and well in today's world creating the same arrogance, intolerance, nationalism and destruction they created two millennia ago.  The End of Faith offers objective criticism of relig-ion and details how much of religion has offered less benevolence and benignity to the world while offering up more vengeance, vindictiveness and destruction all \\"in the name of God\\".<br /><br />For those interested in seeing religion painted with an unvarnished eye, I strongly recommend The End of Faith.  It will challenge many of today's believers, but that is after what Jesus of Nazareth was attempting in His own time.  Those Christians who recall that the first Christians were referred to as \\"The People of the Way\\" will learn from The End of Faith how we have fallen away from that \\"way\\".  Those bold enough to read The End of Faith should come away feeling enlightened, although that \\"enlightenment\\" may prove troubling.f God is dimin-ished by the ways Holy Scripture is misinterpreted in order to meet and support political objec-tives and ends.

0553801503|3.0|Well, Ross Blackman has pretty well expressed my thoughts on this, and so have others, but I'll pile on anyway. <br /> <br />First of all:  Maybe it's just the fact that I had put this series aside for so long, and am coming to it with fresh eyes, but Martin's writing style and characterization really isn't all that good.  His writing style is very effective at dragging you in and making you want to continue, largely I suspect due to his habit of strong opening sentences, ending chapters on cliffhangers, and throwing in surprise twists, but these tricks do not a deep piece of literature make.  (For example, I got very tired of sentences like \\"The dead men sat up.\\"  That might have been a strong and shocking opener the first dozen or so times he used it, but after that, it kinda loses its effect.)   <br /> <br />Second, Martin has (at least for me) a real difficulty at conveying emotional tone in his writing.  I seem to recall that he worked in television for a while, and if so, maybe that's why--as a TV writer, he wouldn't have to convey emotional tone, because the actors would do it for him.  He introduces scenes, situations and characters that *should* be deep and have emotional resonance, and yet somehow he can't realize it.  I'm not sure whether he even understands the potential depth of the situations he creates, let alone has the ability to convey it.  This inability (for me) to convey emotional tone, coupled with the melodramatic levels of violence and misfortune that happen to his characters, sort of leads to the feeling that he doesn't really care about his characters--and if the author doesn't even care, then why should I? <br /> <br />Third:  Speaking of levels of violence, how about that Biter, huh?  Martin here continues a trend I noticed about as far back as the first book, which is almost a fetishization of images of death, gore, violence, suffering and decay.  There are times when high levels of violence and gothic imagery can be used appropriately--for example, to induce certain psychological effects in characters, or to make philosophical or emotional points (see for example Stephen R. Donaldson's writing--he very often uses dark and grim themes to excellent allegorical and symbolic effect), but in order for that to be the case, there has to be something you're trying to say with it.  In Martin's case, there isn't, at least not that I can see; it's nothing more than sensationalism and cheap melodrama.  In which case, someone really needs to tell him to use this stuff *sparingly*--splash too many buckets of blood around, and it loses its effect. <br /> <br />Fourth:  Editing, editing, editing!  A lot of what is in here really did not need to be here, IMO.  Others have made this point too, but it's a good one that should be restated.  Case in point: the ironmen's assault on the north.  This is something that could have been described in a few sentences; we didn't really need to be shown it.  Double-ditto for the Dornish scheming.  There was actually a heck of a lot of repetition and circular plotting here, as well.  A  lot of the \\"new\\" characters he introduces didn't need to be here, and seemed quite similar to each other as well--following a pattern of \\"New Character X, who has Y traumas/issues in his background that cause him to take plot-furthering action Z.\\" (Psst!  Hint for aspiring writers:  When creating new characters, a cheap 'n' easy way to create the illusion of \\"depth\\" is to implant a trauma in their background.  Double points if it has to do with love, and triple points if it's a dead love interest!)   <br /> <br />Four-a:  Just to add to the Cersei pile, I really did not need that many chapters of watching Cersei follow exactly the path I had predicted she would follow all the way from the single chapter he had included at the end of Storm of Swords.  At least if he had made her a competent ruler who rules well and then, on the last page of the book, had her suddenly drop dead from a heart attack,it would have been more interesting; my level of surprise at watching what he wrote for her here was exactly zero.  Wow.  Character X behaves exactly the way I thought s/he would.  What a surprise.  And yes, her prophecy did come across as tacked-on.  If it was something he had dreamed up for her from the get-go, then he should have done a better job of foreshadowing it in the other books.  (Btw:  I'll bet a million bars of gold-pressed latinum it's Jaime who ends up killing her rather than Tyrion--Cersei's a minute older than Jaime, so he also qualifies as her \\"little\\" brother, and it's exactly the sort of non-shocking \\"shocker\\" twist that I would expect.) <br /> <br />Five: Repetition is not your friend!  How many groups of nobles are there out there scheming against each other?  And all the scheming is exactly the same.  Wow, X group of nobles wants marriage/revenge/the throne, etc. so they will take Y action to achieve Z goal!  Maybe that's why he introduced Brienne as a POV character--to get away from all the politics for a bit.  Nevertheless, the political manuevering is something that he should look into cutting way back on from now on.  And if it wasn't political manuevering it was religious manuevering, what with Balon running around drowning men, and R'hllor, and the the High Septon, and so on.  Again, too many plot threads, and all of them far too similar.  I also agree completely that Martin is starting to get *way* too into the heraldry and genealogical relationships of his world, to the point that it's starting to cut into his narrative.  I'm having terrifying flashes of Jordan and clothing details, a la Crossroads of Twilight. <br /> <br />Now are there things Martin does well?  Absolutely, of course. His writing style, as I mentioned previously, is very effective at drawing you in and making you want to continue.  His description and scene-setting is excellent, as always, and he *also* does a very good job of differentiating his various locations from one another (for example, Dorne felt like a convincingly different place than King's Landing, which feels convincingly different from the Riverlands, which feels convincingly different from the Iron Islands, and so on.)  And of course, there are those who would argue that \\"this is a transitional book.  Martin is laying the groundwork for some stuff that's really going to pay off down the line.  Just have faith.\\"  The problem with that argument is that I've been down that road before with Robert Jordan, who's been stuck on \\"transitional\\" for something like seven books now, and even as the books decline in quality, the pay-off just never seems to come.  (And the decline started very close to the same place too, btw, and shared some of the same features, including an over-emphasis on scheming and politics at the expense of plot and proliferation of unnecessary sub-plots that served no purpose other than to drag out the story.) What with Martin's series expanding from three books originally, to six, then to seven (and I've heard whispered rumors that it's actually going to be eight), combined with the proliferation of plotless plots, of characters we didn't need to see, of emphasis on heraldry and lineage, I'm having horrible feelings that I've seen this pattern before.  Martin's certainly not as bad as Jordan *yet,* but the emphasis is on the \\"yet.\\"  I hope Dance with Dragons gets things moving again.
0767812166|4.0|Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen are great together in this adventure of an extra terrestrial that comes to visit our planet. Unfortunately, his spaceship was shot down and made a crash landing in Wisconsin. After assuming the body of a dead house painter, he convinced the man's widow to drive him to Arizona to rendezvous with a rescue ship. Along the way, he learned more about our culture and what it's like to be human. The grieving widow learned to live and love once more, and most importantly, to care for someone else again. One of the best lines in the movie is when Starman (Jeff Bridges) revealed his overall opinion of humans. \\"You are at your very best when things are worst.\\" Director John Carpenter certainly added a winning movie to his list of many credits. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ray of Light was undoubtedly Madonna's greatest album.  It featured her most profound lyrics, her vocals strengthened, it had a real atmosphere to it and some of the coolest experimental sounds to come from a pop icon.  Since that album, being her most experimental, it seems like she's struggled to push her way back into the mainstream.  Music was a good album because Mirwais suits her new style very well and the effects and euro-disco synths complimented it and made the album sound almost like an entirely new style of dance/trip-hop altogether.  American Life was far too similar to Music, only it was a hollow album.  Where Music had its strong points with powerful euro-disco tracks and a real sense of late-night adventure - American Life was lacking anything to give the music any depth.  Basically it sounds like the offcuts of Music, recycled and re-molded into a lacklustre left-wing political effort.  Thankfully Madonna's now chosen to ditch the entire thing and head in yet another direction.  It's nothing new for Madonna to make a dance album considering her roots - but she has never done it quite like this.  Instead of sugary pop, she has a more aggressive presence here.  The lyrics are still somewhat simple but that comes with the dance territory - plus, with that in mind, they're a lot more meaningful than most other commercial dance tracks.  The music is absolutely amazing, very funky.  At times melancholy, exotic then back to 70s disco reinvention.  This beats both Music and American Life.
B00003CXC7|5.0|If you are a Hitchcock fan then you cant go wrong with this one, at true classic.Jimmy Stewart's innocence mixed with the absolute beauty of Grace brings hope to the sinister and dark shadows cast by Raymond. The coupling of Stewart and Grace can only give us the optimistic hope that good will overcome evil -- again and again. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|If you are a Madonna fan then you will love this album. Even if you are not a Madonna fan but love layered and beautiful sonically driven dance music, then you will also love it.    The whole album flows brilliantly from track to track.  There are numerous highlights with my absolute favorites being \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Get Together\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Jump\\", and \\"Isaac\\".  I am so pleased with this album, her best one since Ray Of Light.  Thanks Madonna for this fabulous guilty pleasure.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|<br />Batman Begins tells the story of how Bruce Wayne ended up becoming the Dark Knight. We see his training, and learn what inspires him to fight for justice. Christian Bale is perfect casting, and is the best Batman to ever grace the screen. Michael Caine is a brilliant Alfred with a great sense of humor, Morgan Freeman is brilliant in his supporting role, Katie Holmes is great as Bruce's love interest, and Cillian Murphy is effectively creepy as the Scarecrow. Batman fans, THIS is what you have been waiting to see. While I enjoyed the first two Batman movies of the original series, I felt that they were both lacking something. This Batman brings everything you wanted to see to the screen, and I will be first in line for the sequel.  <br />
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Born To Run is the album that took Bruce Springsteen from a struggling recording artist who was almost dropped by his label to simultaneous covers of Time & Newsweek. All the hype surrounding the album is justified as it is a brilliant collection of songs. From the opening harmonica on \\"Thunder Road\\" to the closing of the mini-opera \\"Jungleland\\", Bruce tells us about Wendy, Terry, Mary, The Magic Rat & Barefoot girl and we hear their stories. Most of the songs deal with escaping one's dull and dreary life for something better. The means of escape are the highways and backstreets. \\"Born To Run\\" is an all time classic and I get chills up my spine every time I hear the opening riffs. \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" tells of the origins of the E Street Band. \\"Meeting Across The River\\" is underrated and when Bruce played it on his recent tour, it got huge applauses. The production has a big sound to it. On some songs it sounds like a hundred instruments are playing. Bruce wanted a Phil Spector Wall of Sound feel and the album achieves that goal. Jon Landau, his future manager, said after seeing Bruce in concert in 1974 that \\"he just saw the future of rock 'n' roll\\". Born To Run helped fulfill that prophecy.  Finally, Sony offers a remastered version of the album which one of first to be released on cd in the late 80's.  The sound quality is superb and the big sound of the album comes through beautifully.  It would have been enough to just have a remastered cd, but this set ups the ante with two DVDs.  The first is a full concert from the Hammersmith Odeon in London and it shows a skinny, bearded Boss showing off why his live shows from that era are legendary.  The second DVD is a documentary detailing the making of the album and it contains all the key players including Ernest \\"Boom\\" Carter who drummed on the title track as well as an integral part of the early E Street Band, keyboardist David Sancious.  On top of all that, you get a great booklet that contains unreleased photos.  It would be great if Sony takes this approach with other albums in Mr. Springsteen's catalog as this treatment is long overdue for an artist of his stature.os.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm only halfway through the season, but I have to say that it's already quite clear how incredible this series is: tightly woven narrative, fabulous characters, and classic Joss Whedon humor.  Not to mention some neat symbolism.  (Did anyone else watch this and think Paradise Lost?)  I can only hope that Serenity will be the beginning of many Firefly-based movies...

If you get easily destracted as I do this is definately your read!!!

He proves that anything is possible.

B000A3DFZE|5.0|I'm dismayed by the reviews that complain that \\"Back Home\\" isn't a rock record, that it doesn't have enough \\"riffs\\" and especially by the criticism that Clapton doesn't have anything to say.  He has plenty to say.  Sadly, some of his fans aren't really interested in what he has to say, they only want \\"riffs\\".  Sure, Clapton is a guitar player.  You might only know him as a rock guitar player or a blues guitar player and maybe that's all some want to hear.  If so, then they're missing out on hearing a musician, not a collection of guitar riffs, a musician who wants to share his feelings with his audience.  Sad that that audience only wants to hear anger, sadness and grief.   <br /> <br />I gave \\"Back Home\\" 5 stars not only because the playing and the singing are stand outs, the production is effective and the songs are fresh but because I think Clapton made exactly the record he wanted to make.  He calls it a \\"feel good\\" album.  And, it is!   <br /> <br />Clapton is an amazinginly versatile performer.  Instead of criticising him for not playing only rock or only blues, he should be praised for being able to play many different genres with ease.  So pop music tinged with blues, reggae and gospel influences isn't everyone's bag but on \\"Back Home\\" Clapton does all of these and does so beautifully. <br /> <br />The style of the music may not be to everyone's taste, but the music on \\"Back Home\\" is as heartfelt and sincere as anything Clapton has every done.  He gets kudos from me for having the courage to make a record about home, family, love and contentment and doing it with superior musicianship and great style. <br />
B000BMSU68|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is such a classic 80's movie and i also have to say that it was Matthew Broadrick best performance ever in a movie!!!!!! When Ferris Bueller decides to ditch school so he can avoid his principal which is out to get him for his absences!!!! In the movie there are two classic scenes  the first one is when the teacher is calling out everyone names to make sure they are there and he keep saying Bueller Bueller and the other one is when they take the hot convertible and they try to run the miles backwards and then the brake goes out and it goes right out a window and hits a tree then hits the ground!!!!!!! Great cast and awesome fun movie!!!!!! If you love movies from the 80's then you should buy this movie its worth every cent and you will be laughing until it hurts!!!!!
B0009VRHLK|3.0|...but I found this oddly hypnotic.  This is not a movie you should watch if you have recently lost a loved one through death, divorce or breakup because if you weren't suicidal before, you will be afterward.  It is basically a stream-of-consciousness type of film that centers on lonliness and remorse after the tragic loss of a loved one.  Anyone who has gone through a devastating loss or breakup will get this movie.  The rest will be puzzled and bored. I had the advantage of knowing a little about the story line beforehand, which helped me appreciate the film more than most reviewers here.  What I liked most about the movie was the lack of \\"Hollywood dialogue\\"....this just looks completely improvised (and perhaps it is), and therefore has a gritty, realistic, truthful feel to it.  Buffalo '66 was darkly hilarious.  This is darkly real (and one of the saddest films I have seen in a long time).

0553801503|5.0|Great feasts, especially the vast ones of high fantasy, are an affair of multiple senses and motives where the convoluted journey through myriad courses can leave the literary diner not merely full, but profoundly changed. And no more so than in A FEAST FOR CROWS, George R. R. Martin's fourth and latest in his ever-expanding saga, A Song of Ice and Fire.    If you count a tantalizing preview of the upcoming A DANCE WITH DRAGONS --- which picks up the massive FEAST's abruptly truncated threads --- and the very necessary appendices listing principal movers and shakers among the families vying for control of his fictional Westeros, you're in for an 800-page ride through the amazing geography of Martin's imagination.    Now I have to admit early on that I didn't really have time this month to delve into a book this size, and opened it thinking (naively) that I could jump out and resume \\"normal\\" life whenever I wanted. I can already hear the rueful laughter of hardcore Ice and Fire fans. Yes folks, you're right; the strange convoluted beauty and visceral energy of Westeros imposes its own \\"normal\\" on anyone who steps through the thin places of our universe into its realm. After only a few hours in that world, I too could see the map of Westeros every time I closed my eyes and could place more and more features onto it without flipping back and forth to the inside covers!    Strangely enough, that amazing power of Martin's prose to weave the reader into its unfolding fabric doesn't include waves and waves of overt magic and mystery, nor even (in this epic segment, at least) the advent or return of magical great beasts. For sure, there's talk of dragons and sorcery, and you do get the odd simmering potion wafted about here and there, but compared to the vibrant presence of characterization, superb dialogue and plot-building, these more conventional aspects of high fantasy are often just supporting elements.    That may sound rather heretical, but once you've traveled a fewpages into the varied quests, flights, machinations and yearnings of Martin's distinctive characters, they quickly develop memorable texture and substance of their own. Martin achieves this in part through his consummate skill in wielding the point-of-view approach, so that the reader --- more fly on the castle wall than omniscient --- becomes wholly invested in their individual fates and futures. Some previous characters in the Westeros saga (the high profile Jon Snow being one to note) never step onto the stage except in conversation, while others who bided their time in the wings through earlier cataclysms (like the fully drawn Brienne of Tarth) emerge to fill the instrumental spaces left by the dead and disappeared.    It almost goes without saying that the Westeros of Martin's dizzily fertile imagination is no more destined for peace, calm and predictability than the Middle East of our \\"real\\" world from which it seems to take some palpable overtones. And not surprisingly, A FEAST FOR CROWS (what more symbol-laden bird is there?) captures moments of awe and transcendence that do more to whet the saga-lover's appetite than to satisfy it. But the company on the journey is another matter. Whether you love them, hate them, puzzle over them, or even grieve over them, the fighting, striving and conspiring families of Westeros and beyond are built on the flesh and bones of deeply felt human nature. The same folks who will bug you to death on the Main Street bus will thoroughly entrance you as they rule over the knights, ladies, connivers and serfs of Martin's remarkable Seven Kingdoms.    Start wherever you will (but preferably at the beginning with A GAME OF THRONES) and you can count on being taken a very willing prisoner by this highest of high fantasy achievements. Look for at least a trio, maybe even a quartet, of new adventures continuing in the illustrious line of A FEAST FOR CROWS.

B0000062GK|5.0|Joe Satriani is one of the greatest guitarists in the world, period. In fact, many would claim he is THE greatest guitarist in the world. Really? Is it possible to make such a claim? This album will take you a step closer to understanding why. <br /> <br />A New Yorker who took up guitar at age 16, Satriani has had a career spanning two decades. Over that time he has established himself as not only a technical whizz, but a versatile musician and composer. Whether it be blues, rock, classical or pop, Satch has done it. But he doesn't just thrash the cliches. His strongest point is his ever-developing individual style. Highly melodic, lyrical and harmonically diverse, his efforts, perhaps most famously on the album Surfing With the Alien, became the basis of rock guitar for the next decade. <br /> <br />But then, in 1998, came what was perhaps Satriani's coming of age. The instrumental rock album Crystal Planet was to display the result of that refinement in style &#8211; an album which not only takes you on a multifarious musical journey, but also reiks of stylistic charm. <br /> <br />Built upon a minimalistic rock base, Satriani uses elements of  modern, alterna and power-ballad rock, techno and pop to create an intensely attractive genre blend. The exact style itself is difficult to describe, combining clean distorted and overdriven guitars in an ambient reverb. One of the most palatable albums I have ever listened to, despite plunging through contrasting landscapes and aural scenery, it remains highly listenable and stylistically consistent. For me, it's Satriani's take on  commercial rock genres of the late 90s and 2000s. <br /> <br />Satriani's lead guitar is the heart and soul of this album. For the majority of the tracks, it is simply Satch, bass and drums. And yet he produces his most convincing performance yet. Why? Quite simply, it is his size. Extremely strong, cantabile melody lines are supported with hypnotic harmony and absorbing tonality &#8211; nevertoo challenging to the ear, but yet remaining connotative &#8211; build a universe of imagery surrounded by abundant atmosphere. Although there are times where two or three other guitars and the occasional keyboard nick in to hold the groove, it's never any more than simple riffs or supporting comp lines. Satriani's main guitar holds up this entire album. <br /> <br />But let's not discount the quality of the supporting musicians. Stu Hamm delivers a shining performance, with his winding bass lines not only laying a solid foundation but often playing lines which appear to consolidate a rhythm guitar. Jeff Campitelli keeps up with the wide range of feels well, in his usual creative but no-nonsense manner, while Eric Caudieux adds some sensory polish through clever synth and effect touches. <br /> <br />Despite expressing a myriad of moods, from a very upbeat opening track (Up in the Sky), past the driving groove of Raspberry Jam Delta V, to the final reflective lullaby which concludes the album, never does it become self-indulgent. There's always a new feel, a new chord progression or some new harmonies around the corner, but it remains simple and succinct enough to avoid being over the top. Satriani displays his usual mind-boggling technique, but certainly not to the point of showing off, at any stage. He simply uses his wide-reaching repetoire to broaden his expression in a controlled fashion, unafraid to refrain if necessary. <br /> <br />This album approaches on what I would term 'true pop'. Perhaps testiment to the grazioso vocalist sound Satriani manages to achieve, combined with decent pop writing, this is an album which is full of memorable melodies and catchy riffs. And yet it never becomes annoying. No matter what time of the day, what mood you might be in, it's listenable and enjoyable. What everyone wants in an album. <br /> <br />Interested in further Satriani listening? Surfing With the Alien, The Extremist and Strange Beautiful Music are his strongestall-round releases, while Engines of Creation, Satriani's techno project, is a good example of his versatility.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna's Ray of Light is a great album from one of the best female singers out there!!!!!! After having a baby girl when this album came out Madonna changed her lifestyle and this cd really shows it!!!!!!!! I liked that this one was a spiritual side of her and all the songs are great to listen too over and over again!!!!!! I also liked that she wrote a song for her baby girl!!!!!!! If you love the Material Girl then go out and get this cd its worth every penny,but then again Madonna is worth every penny!!!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|First I have to say, I liked American Life...sure Madonna was clumsy with the lyrics and the rap thing I truly don't understand but she took some chances on the album...some were good, some not so good.  I was looking forward to Confessions for quite awhile and I've been listening to it now for about 3 weeks and I have to say that this is her best since Ray of Light.  I do have to agree though that lyrically Madonna's skills seem to have gotten weaker since Ray of Light, but once you hear Sorry, Future Lovers, Let It Will Be, Forbidden Love, Jump and Like It Or Not, you will NOT be able to get it out of your head.  This album is total ear candy.  Pure and simple. Not to mention she's 47 years old and she completely puts today's young pop tarts to shame.  Madonna is and will always be an icon in pop music.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has a amazing voice and needless to say i think she is a lot better then Britney that is my opinion!!!! When i heard this cd each song is great and some of it is very energic and some of it really moves me!!!!!! I think that each song is a five star and the same for the album itself!!!!!! Christina really does take us to some of her past which i think its awesome that she can write songs about her past and Rolling Stone Magazine had a issue saying that this is a must have cd for any music collection and i would have to agree you will love this cd from a talented young singer!!!!!!
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Madonna seriously needs to just stop making music.  This isn't a very likeable album.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|An absolutely incredible achievement. A tour de force within the genre.  No need to say more.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ok, I was all pumped and ready to hear a pumpin club cd that it was originally hyped up to be, however, while the songs are dance-themed, no real peak-hour cuts. what makes this music stand out to me though, is the beauty of the music, they way the rhythms flow into each other and the way she works her lyrics around the music, it all fits perfectly. These are ALL songs that get stuck in your head and will not get out! This album is right up there with Ray of Light musically. Very electronic, it's gorgeous, it's fun, it's a must have. Usually a Madonna album contains anywhere from 2 to 4 songs that I like and listen to the most, this particular album, I love them ALL, thats a rarity for me.
B000093BDX|3.0|It's hard to say anything bad about an album that contains such classic songs as, \\"California Girls,\\" \\"Don't Worry Baby,\\" and just about all of the early tracks on this disc.  However, I will.  This is yet another attempt to release a \\"Best Of\\" Beach Boys album that downgrades them into a \\"summer fun\\" band that never did anything deeper.  While containing many great tunes, I fear that many casual fans may buy this album and think that it's all of the Beach Boys catalogue they'll ever need.  Here are the reasons why that's a bad idea: <br /> <br />A.  This album contains three songs from the Pet Sounds album: \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" \\"God Only Knows,\\" and \\"Sloop John B.\\"  Pet Sounds is an absolutely essential album to own, especially if you want to get into the Beach Boys (Rolling Stone also recently named it the second best album of all time).  Don't settle for just owning the three most popular songs. <br /> <br />B.  While the mammoth follow-up to Pet Sounds, \\"Smile,\\" was scrapped and never released as a Beach Boys album (Brian Wilson finally finished it and released it himself last year), why didn't they use any of the fantastic songs from those sessions?  \\"Cabinessence,\\" the un-truncated \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" and especially that album's crowning acheivement, \\"Surf's Up,\\" are all missing in action.  These innovative, brilliantly written songs truly represent the best the Beach Boys ever got (especially with the latter song).  While not a \\"Smile\\" cut, the omission of their best 70s song, \\"'Til I Die\\" (one of Brian's personal favorites), is also confounding. <br /> <br />C.  The album contains far too many cuts from the Boys' \\"past-their-prime-nostalgia-act\\" period (i.e., anything past about 1975) when Mike Love was desperately clinging to popularity by writing surfy songs as if it was decades earlier.  This is apparent on tracks such as the cringeworthy cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" \\"Getcha Back,\\" and the horrendous, 1988 mistake, \\"Kokomo\\" (is it really even a Beach Boys song without Brian Wilson's involvement?) <br /> <br />If you need a collection of early Beach Boys hits and you can't get your hands on a copy of the wonderfully mastered, now out-of-print \\"Endless Summer,\\" buy this disc.  You won't be disappointed with those lovely, early songs.  If you really want do dig deeper into *why* the Beach Boys are regarded as one of history's finest bands, be sure to get a copy of \\"Pet Sounds\\" and download some of those key \\"Smile\\" tracks.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Where do you go from when you have pretty much done it all? You return to your roots, and take samples of your old music and make it anew.  Madonna's new album is by no means groundbreaking, but it still gives her an edge.  After her last album, \\"American Life\\", people have been waiting for the old Madonna to return. I feel as though many fans of Madonna's music will be happy with this one.  Her lead off track \\"Hung Up\\" is catchy, but I find that it doesn't compare to the rest of the tracks on the album.  Don't base your opinion on this album by that one song.  If you are able to listen to it prior to purchasing it, you will find that she has another hit on her hands.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|If you were hoping to get something new or fresh, then this isn't the right album. Go buy Jennifer Lopez's last album, at least she's inventive.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|All I can say is WOW! I am impressed with Madonna's Confessions. From the first song \\"Hung up\\" to the last song \\"Like it or Not\\",  Confessions is a danceable, fun, well written cd. I have to say, American Life was ok, it was a different side of Madonna and I did like it for showing that, but Confessions is such a breath of fresh air and is shows that Madonna is the queen of the club!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This music is incredible and is a return to the Madonna we all fell in love with in the first place.  Hit play and you have an hour of non stop fun!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|when this album debut at #1 in April, it gave Mariah her biggest selling first week ever, and gave her the biggest song of 2005, We Belong Together. (any singles by j.lo or madonna that lasted half that much at number 1?? yeah shutup) and the #2 hit Shake It Off, and the top 20 hit It's Like That. this version of the album is even better than the original, the dvd has 4 videos, and the cd has 4 new tracks, including Don't Forget About Us, which is already at #20 on the Hot 100. so, i recommend you buy it, if you like the original you will love this one even more.
B000B8QF14|4.0|Having seen these guys live 4 times over the past ten years, twice on the American Idiot tour, I was excited for this live album. Granted, the AI tour was very rehearsed and every show was pretty much the same, but it was still a great tour. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this isn't the full set of the show that was recorded. Six...yes SIX songs were cut out. Brain Stew without Jaded just feels incomplete. We are the Champions was one of the bright spots of the tour, yet they left it out. And to top it off, the Green Day staple of calling fans on stage to play Knowledge...you guessed it, left out! In addition, although some of the interviews and behind the scenes footage was nice, it interrupted the flow of the concert. <br /> <br />Green Day are one of the top live arena bands out there, but this album unfortunately doesn't do them justice. If you want to experience GD live, go to a show. You'll remember it for the rest of your life. If you've been to one, this album will be a huge let down.
B000001EYW|5.0|Im 19 years old and straght, but I love beegees music. I can't stand disco,how unfortunate that they were even involved. <br />  I began liking the beegees as a child,there 60's music. Seeing that I was a fan,my older brother bought still waters for me in the summer of '97. An this is my take on each song. <br />  ALONE- the first time I heared it I was disapointed,why? Barry used that aweful falsetto voice. <br />  I SURRENDER- now this is a good song worthy of bgs,it is very up beat almost like hip hop. <br />  I Could Not Love You More- this is an excelent ballet. But its not too slow its very lively and keeps you tapping the foot. <br />  STILL WATERS- a great song, however when Barry sings you hear more air than voice. <br />  WITH MY EYES CLOSED- very contempary, hands down the best up beat song on the album. <br />  IRRESISTIBLE FORCE,SMOKE & MIRRORS- I can review both songs on the same line.Both have good parts but one giant flaw,what? ROBIN GIBB hearing this guy sing is just painful, he sounds like he has his finger down his throat,aweful! <br />  CLOSER THAN CLOSE- as always Maurice has at least 1 terrific song,and this is no diff.  <br />   I WILL, OBSESSIONS, MIRACLES HAPPEN- all are to perfection, the perfect love song in I WILL,OBSESSIONS is different I suppose you have to take your own meaning from it,nevertheless it is very relaxing, MIRACLES HAPPEN is very up lifting,if you don't have cold chills when you first hear it somthing is wrong. <br />   AS anything there is some bad,but the good is certinly more abundant. So if you like music you really should buy this one.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|It's hard to write a review for this movie from the point of view of someone who hasn't played Final Fantasy VII for the original Playstation.  No other game has made as much of an impact on me since that fateful day in 1997 when I picked it up. <br /> <br />This movie will definitely mean more to fans than non-fans.  Much like how people will recommend reading a book over the movie based on the book (unless you absolutely hate reading) it will be hard to understand more of the subtle tones in the movie.  Like what the story with the Turks is or why Cloud continues to think of Aeris and Zack even if the movie tries to include some of the more significant parts of the backstory.  I would recommend playing the game and then watching the movie (though PS1 graphics haven't carried over well in the new age of the XBOX 360 and other next gen systems).  Understanding that this probably won't exactly be the easiest thing for casual watchers to do, I'll write more for the non-fans since all FFVII diehards will have no problem watching this movie. <br /> <br />I'll end by saying that this is not a 5 star movie unless you have a complete grasp on the story.  The plot is relatively thin and unsatisfying (and possibly confusing) for anyone who hasn't caught up on the events 2 years prior to the time of this movie.  If you've seen Final Fantasy:  The Spirits Within, then you may not be too excited to see this movie.  FF: AC is much better at captivating the audience (even with the plot weakness).  It's bigger on action and oozes a sense of style that cannot be captured with live action.  Imagine the Matrix times 10.  Sure, some of the action is a bit over the top, but it brings more of a sense of awe that people can do CG like that than it does the sense of disbelief and disdain for that kind of action. <br /> <br />In the end, I'd have to say that this movie is recommended for anyone who likes video games and/or action movies.  If you're expecting something deeper and philisophical and artsy (in the traditional sense), then you're better off passing on this and watching something else. <br />
B0007PAMR4|4.0|The extended cut isn't a big deal.  All the footage used was cutting room floor junk unfit for a theatrical print (damaged, unfinished, poorly acted, unable to be match cut, etc), which is why Lynch took his name off that one.  Technically Lynch never had the editing rights to begin with (something he'd never overlook again).  Lynch sold out.  He admitted it.  Some of the footage has never been seen since, like the scenes concerning bulb agriculture or the Arakeen palace garden...both done faithfully to the book.  The Extended TV Edition's novelty unfortunately wears off very quickly.  I've also heard the DTS mix that's been in foreign markets for a long time is nothing to write home about.  However, this will be the first time any anamorphic version of Dune has been made available in America.  Ironic that I just finally got a video card that lets me take letterbox DVD's and make them look almost exactly like anamorphic DVD's on my widescreen TV.  Funny.<br /><br />Addition:  If the above didn't sting enough, Lynch was also signed to do two sequels.  In response to the next review, no \\"remastering\\" would have been done on the original late assembly cut, since this was not the digital age of film.  But since the original negatives for all the footage still existed, yes the quality would have been better for that version on theatrical prints...with all the sound mixed and efx shots finished.  That might be what you mean.  The original negatives for that version apparently didn't survive.  Same thing happened with Lynch's original cut of Blue Velvet, though that's not such a big deal since he still cut the theatrical version as well.  All the additional footage is from the cutting room floor scraps.  Some of them may be the same shots, but they are alternate takes of the work print material from storage.<br /><br />Also, I should clarify what I meant regarding \\"selling out\\".  This was both in monies, as well as a promise (more of an emotional compensation) to allow the director full authority over Blue Velvet's cut, minus the length requirement.  Unfortunately on Dune it was too late.  As he's said, this compromised the final result.  There is almost ZERO chance David Lynch is involved on this DVD.  It's taken the poor guy years even to admit to the facts surrounding it.  For a long time he'd just say they took it from him and ruined it.  David Lynch's Dune doesn't exist.  Raffaella De Laurentiis' version is what we've got.  I'll admit the ambiguity and confusing quality of it may have been what appealed to me early on, but you can't help but want the intended cut.  I just don't want anyone to get suckered in to thinking this DVD is going to be as special as Universal is promoting it to be.  I feel 99% certain this is just the foreign version, with the daughter introducing some deleted scenes, some stills of the production, an old Lynch making-of piece, the lousy extended TV version, and the newest anamorphic transfer of the conformed negative (or maybe a new interpositive they printed from the one in storage).  So from my perspective, the anamorphic theatrical version is good news, none of the rest is.  All the bonuses will probably just get me depressed about what we've been deprived.<br /><br />More: People at Universal are in fact spreading rumors about this DVD to hype it up in time for release, possibly to increase pre-orders from vendors.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's the whole purpose behind the delay.  David Lynch has said on his website's forum he has nothing to do with this DVD.<br /><br />Oh, and I also agree the cover art up there is dorky.<br /><br />02/14/2006:<br /><br />Cover art turns out not to be so bad, though I do prefer the other versions.  Universal and Deluxe did not do any de-dusting or de-scratching in the digital domain, likely because they only had a hidef transfer to work with, rather than a 2 to 4k version that you would really need.  The sound is a tad compressed, dialog sibilants don't like to be too loud, and there is some distortion from the final mastering being too loud on the audio end.  Picture-wise, aside from the dust, scratches, and not the greatest resolution, it is quite good.  The dynamic range of the anamorphic theatrical side is excellent, with subtle color gradations.  The only defects present in my copy from Best Buy were some very minor chapter change sound quantization glitches as it switches over, which happened more frequently than most films due to the sheer abundance of chapter and scene markers...at least one per scene.<br /><br />This film is clearly a work of stylistic \\"art\\"...whether you dig the style or not.  In my opinion, this is fine art through and through.  In an era where I can never get over the office-chair fakery of CGI, Dune's look continues to impress me.  No other film ever made will look like this again.  The photography, the set design, the casting, the sound design & music (practically the same thing in a Lynch film), the costumes, the stunningly realistic make-up...the composition in color, design, geometry, and attention to detail in each shot is something unique.  Lynch is first a painter, and it shows here perhaps more than on any other film...and probably more his personal style.  How many years has he been painting Bob the demon on his roof using toxic \\"texturing\\" materials?  Dune is further into the mind of Lynch than we'll ever get in terms of aesthetics, which is maybe why its box office failure was so tormenting for him.  There have been many great films throughout the years that flopped, though.  And Dune, based on one of the most complicated novels ever written, went up against The Terminator and 2010 that year.  A great year for science fiction, you have to admit, but likely the primary factor at work.  Terminator was quite a new experience for moviegoers with an action/chase sci-fi take, and 2010 was a far more accessible and less \\"arty\\" film than 2001.  Audiences were being spoiled with easily accessible, easily understood sci-fi in 1984.  It's no wonder Dune was such a hard sell.  If they'd simply held off another year on the release it might have made double.<br /><br />Besides the lack of certain scenes early on such as the Mapes & the knife or the palace garden scene, the primary influence of Raffaella seems to be after about the 1hr 37min mark.  It is beyond this point where the film seems heavily abridged compared to the earliest cut that Dino would have viewed.  Prior to this point the narrative flows quite nicely, even with the aforementioned omissions.  There is a great deal simply missing in the last 30% that he obviously shot but the producer felt could be left out to more quickly reach the climax.  I'm not saying everything belongs in the film.  Many of the deleted shots/scenes simply feel too bookish and explanative...too overt of an attempt to inform us rather than develop character and story.  The extended version's acting is generally overdone, while the theatrical release is appropriate and rousing.  I'm quite fond of Lynch's direction here and the choice in takes used in terms of acting honesty.  But the final scene lacks the impact it clearly would have had with more development of Paul and his mother amongst the Fremen, the battles, and, of course, Paul and Chauni's love...growing.  You can't just say that.  You've got to show it through scenes of substance.  A montage of battle and sex doesn't cut it, and it leads right into the abrupt taking of the Water of Life.  The montage should have been separate scenes.  I don't have a problem with the revised Water of Life concept.  It simply needed more of the Jihad and terrible purpose dreams.  With that, the earlier scene cursing his mother, more scenes of romance and battle, Thufir's death, and the announcement of marrying Irulan, I think the film would have been improved.  I think Thufir's death is a quality scene.  Add the garden scene, the doctor taking the bag to the thopter near burningpalm trees, and do a CG scene of the desert blooming then quickly dying, and I think the film would pretty much be complete.  Still no proper sword/shield fighting, but...<br /><br />As far as the weirding modules, if you've read my \\"So You Want To Read Dune For The First Time\\" guide, or my book and letterboxed movie reviews, then you know what my grasp of the Dune universe is. Case in point: the calendar in Dune is recorded since the creation of the Spacing Guild.  The events in the book take place more than 24,000 years from now.  The initial colonizations occured with sub-light generational starships millenia before...essentially a pre-history.  Remember, they had to discover Arrakus through conventional means long before the spice could ever be used for folding space.  Thus the Fremen really are no less natives than Native Americans.  In spite of how different it is from the book, watching this film again after all these years I must admit Lynch's interpretation is inspired.  I don't mean that in the sense of that's how I'd do it...I wouldn't.  Mine would be uncompromising.  But the concept of the modules and how it integrates so well with the precepts of Dune is obviously inspired...from on high, from Lynch's unconsciousness, from someone else's, or maybe 'cause a little birdie told him.  Who knows...  But you don't just contrive an idea like that off the top of your head for the hell of it because you're lazy or feel like screwing up a masterpiece.  It loses the nuance of what the weirding way meant in Herbert's book, but succeeds with a more blatant, and I think ultimately successful take for this film.  In a sense, the modules are a physicality of human thought and potential, exemplified by Paul's weirding-derived telekinesis at the end.  Whether I would have done it or not doesn't change the fact that there's evidence of an inspired idea in it.  Then you must consider how the film ended up a little butchered before reaching theaters.  I think this will be the best version we will ever get.  One can hope enough people will buy it to convince Universal to do a 4k transfer of the conformed negative and attempt an ultimate edition, free of dust, scratches, or slightly compressed audio.  I'm quite satisfied with this release, though.nder Dune was such a hard sell.  If they'd simply held off another year on the release it might have made double.    Besides the lack of certain scenes early on such as the Mapes & the knife or the palace garden scene, the primary influence of Raffaella seems to be after about the 1hr 37min mark.

Add the garden scene, the doctor taking the bag to the thopter near burning palm trees, and do a CG scene of the desert blooming then quickly dying, and I think the film would pretty much be complete.  Still no proper sword/shield fighting, but...    As far as the weirding modules, if you've read my \\"So You Want To Read Dune For The First Time\\" guide, or my book and letterboxed movie reviews, then you know what my grasp of the Dune universe is. Case in point: the calendar in Dune is recorded since the creation of the Spacing Guild.  The events in the book take place more than 24,000 years from now.  The initial colonizations occured with sub-light generational starships millenia before...essentially a pre-history.  Remember, they had to discover Arrakus through conventional means long before the spice could ever be used for folding space.  Thus the Fremen really are no less natives than Native Americans.  In spite of how different it is from the book, watching this film again after all these years I must admit Lynch's interpretation is inspired.  I don't mean that in the sense of that's how I'd do it...I wouldn't.  Mine would be uncompromising.  But the concept of the modules and how it integrates so well with the precepts of Dune is obviously inspired...from on high, from Lynch's unconsciousness, from someone else's, or maybe 'cause a little birdie told him.  Who knows...  But you don't just contrive an idea like that off the top of your head for the hell of it because you're lazy or feel like screwing up a masterpiece.  It loses the nuance of what the weirding way meant in Herbert's book, but succeeds with a more blatant, and I think ultimately successful take for this film.  In a sense, the modules are a physicality of human thought and potential, exemplified by Paul's weirding-derived telekinesis at the end.  Whether I would have done it or not doesn't change the fact that there's evidence of an inspired idea in it.  Then you must consider how the film ended up a little butchered before reaching theaters.  I think this will be the best version we will ever get.  One can hope enough people will buyit to convince Universal to do a 4k transfer of the conformed negative and attempt an ultimate edition, free of dust, scratches, or slightly compressed audio.  I'm quite satisfied with this release, though.
B00001OH7N|3.0|It is completely incorrect to say that Bowie started progressive rock.  I haven't even heard this album yet, but I saw someone state that this was the album that led to others by King Crimson and Yes.  That statement couldn't be more wrong.  Crimson had already become famous and sere appearing in America before this album was even in conception. <br />That is all.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|First off, Mariah and Madonna do two different types of music.  It is stupid to compare them.  Why can't we buy both cd's?  They are both great in their own particular genre.  My favorite song it probably Isaac.  Everyone else thought it was weird, but it gets stuck in your head.  This album is much better than American Life.  I think the album flows well together.  I can see all these songs being played in the club if not for the beats alone.  I'm a member of Team L.A.M.B. but I can support other artist as well.  When you back yourself into a corner, your mind will never expand.
B000BGH22W|2.0|I'm a true die hard Harry Potter and John Williams fan and I looked forward to the new soundtrack with great expectation. I was dissapointed when I heard that John Williams would no longer be doing the scores, but if he approved of the new guy, then it was ok by me. I waited for the store to open and was the first to arrive and buy the new soundtrack.  I opened the CD immediatly and popped it in my player.  The first few songs were pretty cool.  I enjoyed the Quidditch World Cup the best.  But as it went on I became terribly dissapointed.  The songs were becoming redundant.  And where is the main Harry Potter theme?! The one that make Harry Potter so magical! I don't even want to know what is up with the last three songs.  I litterally yelled WTF and a few choice words when they came on.  Rock in Harry Potter?! It's a magical world where everything should feel old and mysterious.  What is with this?  There better be a viable excuse for those.  I plan on finding one when I see the movie on the 18th.  Harry Potter fans, beware.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah is back again with the rerelease of The Emancipation of Mimi, the best selling album of 2005. The re-release includes her latest hit, Don't Forget About Us, which is already an AIRPLAY hit already, unlike some unoriginal, repetitive songs that get huge downloads because of the obsessed fan base. Anyway, the album also includes So Lonely, which i think could be a hit if released someday. You all know WBT REmix by now as it was played a lot during this year. <br />So dont miss the album of 2005, which already sold 4 million copies in US, some artists COULD ONLY DREAM OF these days. Yeah, time goes by so slowly.
B00006879E|3.0|ok, befor every maroon5 fan that reads this piles \\"not help full\\" votes on this review, bear in mind that I did buy this CD because \\"harder to breath\\" is fantastic.<br />perhaps you wonder why three stars, well I'll tell you; it has one good song.<br />\\"Harder to Breathe\\" great song, the first time I heard it on the radio I hade to have the CD, it has a wonderfull punch to it.<br />\\"this love\\" yah, it's OK... the first trillion times you hear it, then for some reson it get's less listenable.<br />\\"Shiver\\" OK in small doses.<br />\\"She Will Be Loved\\" slow and whiny voise not realy wining me over here.<br />\\"sunday morning\\" what the...devil is this? it, somehow sounds like a christmas carol actuly.<br />to sum up; if you allready like mroon5 you probly allready have this CD, and don't actuly need to read this review.<br />if you don't have the CD, and want to know if you should have it; here is somthing to consider: if you like, say... usher, r&b, pop, and John Mayer: buy this CD! right now! you'll LOVE it.<br />if you like, rock, liz phair, Eric Clapton, or even jack johnson; run. run away (ok it's not that bad, but I an tring to make a point).
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Please give me a break. Little girls maybe can love this CD. This CD is not for adults or people understand about music. If you buy this crap you will be sorry. Damn I was hoping for something better!!!!!
0805062971|5.0|This book really moves you!! The movie is wonderful but the book connects you with other worlds, other unreal/real dimensions of the human being. Jacques Lacan said that one's self, the subject,  is determined by the \\"Other\\", that unconscious reality that troubles differentiating what is a dream and what is real. That \\"Other\\" is everywhere, and mainly determined by that symbolic dimension, particularized by every human being.  One's reality is always under the sight of others, and in the \\"Fight Club\\", Tyler Durden's world is created when he asleep; however, sometimes one cannot differentiate if when one is dreaming, and when reality is an extension of dreams. This book really explores the unconscious mind and takes us to explore the most hidden fears and unveiled ghosts that haunt ourselves.
B000B8QF00|4.0|These days, there are actually few times when greatest hits packages can really make or break an artist perfectionally. Unfortunately, most of the time, it isn't the actual case. For our friends from Canada like Bryan Adams, he hasn't always had had that problem, and Celine Dion has definitely had had that with a lackluster hits package. As for our other great Alanis Morissette, she hasn't scored a package yet, that has reflected her ups and downs as a great during the Warner Brothers era. Well, that has all just recently changed into one compilation that has surely learned.<br /><br />Alanis Morissette's 2005 greatest hits package The Collection, does a very good job at reflecting on Alanis and her surprising career. The collection does actually carry out very well, even for the fact that almost little to nothing is actually overshadowed on this package. The album does include her big hits like Ironic from the 1996 Grammy-winning Album Of The Year Jagged Little Pill, You Oughta Know, the somber Thank You, Hands Clean, and the down to Earth track Everything. The collection also focuses on her time with movies like the highly-acclaimed Uninvited from the Nicholas Cage 1998 flick City Of Angels, and Still from Dogma. The album also includes a new track to the mix. Her cover of Seal's breakthrough track Crazy. The song is arguably with a little more of a dance bit, but for Alanis, she does pull it off quite nicely.<br /><br />Yet, Alanis is one of the very few acts to still show her music very well as a performer these past few years. As for The Collection it is a must buy for anybody who doesn't own a Alanis Morissette record, or for a die hard fan. Isn't that Ironic!<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Enjoyment: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|Just as the new film of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stands in stark contrast to all previous adaptations, so does its score break away from the mold of all previous Austen-adaptation scores. Oh, yes, there's the familiar trilling piano we've grown to expect, but this score is more along the lines of a Merchant-Ivory film; aching, moody, and transcendent.<br /><br />Written by Dario Marianelli and performed by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, the brief score only clocks in at forty-two minutes and twenty-two seconds, but that is plenty of time for some great music. From haunting violin work (\\"A Postcard from Henry Purcell\\") to the beautiful theme for Lizzy herself (\\"Liz on Top of the World\\"), the music is rich and varied. \\"Arrival at Netherfield\\" has a jittery sense of excitement, and all the tracks composed for the dances in the film (\\"Meryton Townhall\\" and \\"Another Dance\\") are lively and joyous, as is \\"Can't Slow Down\\".  \\"Your Hands Are Cold\\" is the true standout, however; sweeping, beautiful, and, like the scene it was written for, unforgettable.<br /><br />The only element I think lacking is a stronger main theme for Darcy himself, which would have been nice. Really, other than that, I can find no fault with Marianelli's work. If you are a fan of the new film (or a writer looking for background music), this is a must-have.<br /><br />GRADE: B+
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I must say i did enjoy this cd. However, Madonna can do soo much better. The lyrics have no meaning and seem to have been written by a 10th grader. The music is great and a welcome change from other popular artists. The tempo is the same throughout, though, so I think I will become easily bored with this cd.
0553801503|2.0|Feast for Crows is sadly becoming increasingly typical in the genre fiction I read.  It is driven by plot twists that grow increasingly convoluted until you begin to realize that the author truly has no idea how to resolve all the tangles and knots. <br /> <br />I have never seen a book so full of editorialized excuses.  On Mr. Martin's web site, in a note/aftermath at the end of Feast, even in the acknowledgements.  He *knows* this is a subpar effort and only just stops shy of apologizing for it. <br /> <br />It is quite the post-modern experience to be reading a fantasy novel and thinking through it all, \\"The author can't manage this.\\"  I honestly don't believe the man is capable of finishing the series, and, at least to my mind, thereby joins the august company of Robert Jordan's Freudian nightmare - The Wheel of Time. <br /> <br />Martin points optimistically towards the release of the next book in 2006.  Already in these reviews we see that date slipping to 2007.  Or will it in fact be another 3-5 years?  Given the delayed release of Feast, and the disappointment attendant to that release, you'd have to be quite the optimist... the kind of person who would be quickly humiliated and dishonored in Martin's universe. <br /> <br />To be specific - the characterization is as spot on as it has always been.  Martin has had this gift from the beginning of the series and there's no point denying it to him now.  Some complain about the pacing, but personally I don't object to spending time with the characters. <br /> <br />The plotting and overall structure of the book, though, is pretty inexcusable.  I don't want to spoil (and won't) but Martin claims to have split one book into two in order to follow the full story arcs of half the characters, instead of half the story arc for all the characters.  But in Feast, I don't see where he completed the story arc for *any* characters short of the ones who die... and there really aren't that many of them in comparison to previous books. <br /> <br />He leaves us with serial cliffhangers more suitable to soap opera than to quality fiction, and the knowledge that the characters' problems cannot possibly resolved in the next book (because we know in advance that they won't be in it).  So we will get more teasers 2 books from now.  Given Martin's recent output, that could well take a decade. <br /> <br />I'm terribly disappointed in Feast for Crows.  It's a great place in the series to take a stand and say - no more.  Maybe I'll pick up the remaining books when he's finished the whole series.  I really don't believe he ever will.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|I have always liked Avenged Sevenfold mainly because they were always extremely experimental with their music and you really couldn't classify them in a genre. However, with A7X's latest release \\"City Of Evil\\" most of the experimentation disappears. This album basically sounds more like a punky album than anything, partially because their lead singer M. Shadows underwent throat surgery before the recording of this album. I really don't feel like A7X is A7X without Shadows's growling, which is somthing this album lacks dearly. It also came to my attention that this album is much more focused on gutairs than anything else on this album. Usually that is a good thing, however in A7X's case it's not a great thing. I think they are trying to make up for the vocals being so....modern day punk-ish. In essence there are some good spots on this album but it just won't do next time around, A7X best go back to their roots.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|What a year Mimi has had! This New Re-Packaged C.D is Brilliant on so many levels..Hooray Mariah..Dont forget about Us is a great song
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I'm a big Madonna fan, but am not afraid to say that everything she touches does NOT turn to gold.  I didn't like the Erotica Album at all.  I did like the guitar music on American Life, but could have done without the title song.  I'm also a DJ, so I have a ton of Madonna remixes and am consistently amazed at how often she is requested.  Not just by gay fans either, she's requested by everyone when I spin.  I like the new cd.  I like it a lot.  In my opinion, Hung Up is one of the weakest tracks on the cd.  As is I Love New York.  I find myself drawn to different songs at different times.  My favorite has to be Future Lovers.  Its just dripping with Giorgio Moroder.  It's amazing.  I have a great pair of headphones, so I've been able to hear every last piece of production.  Let It Will Be is great.  I think if you stripped it of its beat and added an orchestra, it could have been a song in Evita.  I like the cd.  I refuse to over analyze it.  Its fun, its beyond catchy, and I'm sure it will generate some chart toppers for her.  I have a very diverse group of friends, a few of whom are not big Madonna's fans and they like it as much as we do.  I think it's quite remarkable that after 20 some odd years in the business, she's still putting out great music.  It also amazes me how everytime she disappears for a little while, they say she's \\"over.\\"  Still after 20 years, they act like she's a flash in the pan.  Get used to it people, she's not going anywhere.  And also note that unlike Mariah & Whitney, Madonna has been drug free and break down free.  She's obviously doing something right.  So, shut up and dance already!<br /><br />Peace.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Madonna shoulda Stayed away from the spotlight..After such great records in 2005, Her Confessions is seriously lacking the Originality it needs to stand out..The songs ALL sound the same and the Music is recycled and feels very plastic..
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions On A Dance Floor is Madonna returning to top form.  This album is a non-stop tour de force, and makes you want to dance, from beginning, to end.  Even though Madonna makes \\"Confessions\\" on the album, it's always fun!   There are so many tracks that stand out on this album, it is amazing:  \\"Hung Up\\" (the lead single), \\"Get Together\\" (this one is the BEST), \\"Sorry\\" (a dance floor stomper, and the rumoured second single), \\"Let It Will Be\\" (an AWESOME crafted song), \\"Forbidden Love\\" (this song is pure EXCELLENCE), \\"Jump\\" (AWESOME!), and \\"Push\\" (very cool song, very funky.)  This is really a great album, and any of these fools giving it a one star, just because they do not like her, should get a life.  Madonna is BACK, and better than EVER!
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|This is why I wonder where or why wonderboys lost there marbles sometime someplace. This CD recollects some of the most emo-intelligent music ever, and I mean EVER recorded.  <br /> <br />Do I hear you say self-indulgence? Yes, perhaps, but only for world music's sake. God only knows why we need this emotional \\"we're all only human (babies, kids, grownups) but we stand up for it\\" approach in the lyrics of Steve \\"H\\" just to try to reach one another without restraints,complexes, prejudices etc. God only knows? What if I do? Would the world become a better place? That's up to you, folks!  <br /> <br />Imho this is the only way to get to the heart of things nowadays. These lyrics tell me Steve H. is a real soul brother with the likes of Peter Gabriel, Jon Anderson, Roger Hodgson, Bono, Jim Kerr, Roland Orzabal, Mark Hollis, Richard Ashcroft, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Seal, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell, John Lennon, Bob Marley, Lauryn Hill etc. Ouch, this wasn't meant to be just a namedropping but only my reflection on some of the rare ones who found the right way from soul to soul through popular music.  <br /> <br />I own the Campaign edition thx to my deeply loved cousin and soul mate and this CD has quickly found its way alongside with the stablemates of my all time favourites.  <br /> <br />Many of these are prog. I admit, and I'm mostly proud of it. Listening to any, and I mean ANY kind of music or sound wave generated on this blue marble ball by any creature at all, I certainly do not let interfere the overblown opinion of those who judge a book by its cover.  <br /> <br />JUST LISTEN TO THE MUSIC!!! WATCH THAT SOUND !!! <br /> <br />Marillion's Marbles is only Prog music? Answer the question after these:  <br /> <br />- The Massive Attack intro to \\"The Invisible Man\\". Gasp. <br />- All Of the Marble Interludes are LoFi enough to appear on any Portishead or Hooverphonic album etc.  <br />- Genie is up to date Simple Minds, only better.   <br />- Fantastic Place is another one of their fantastic Crowded House or Talk Talk impersonifications, uncomparable and pure as only they or Marillion with Steve H. can be. Holy!   <br />- The Only Unforgivable Thing should have been sung by Richard Ashcroft of the late \\"The Verve\\" including organ intro etc. Brilliant track!  <br />- Ocean Cloud: if anything compares to Pink Floyd standard, this one does the trick!  <br />- The Damage: intro comes in Maroon 5 avant la lettre. Challenge any new poprock band in intensity, melody, tension and musicianship. Yours to take!  <br />- Don't hurt yourself: folkpop/rock on quite another level than the Corrs (no comment).  <br />- You're Gone: Simple Minds 2005 revisited, only far better...  <br />- Angelina: I just loved the close \\"Steve H.\\" harmonies \\"Lonely man's best friend\\"  la Crowded House on the preview excerpts on the Marillion website. But the guitar work of Steve Rothery on this track makes up for everything!  <br />- Drilling Holes: XTC meets Beatles ecstasy indeed! (the pop group, not the drug, you cokeheads!)  <br />-Neverland: a dream to end it all?  <br /> <br />Wake up, lads, to one of the greatest albums in rock history, and only in it's own sake!  <br /> <br />There's one for everyone...  <br /> <br />depeters  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000002N3J|4.0|This was marketed as Madonna's Greatest Ballad Hits when it was released, but could have gone under the title of Immaculate Collection Part 2 since it covered many hits not found on the Part 1.   <br /> <br />This interesting compilation focusses on all the ballads including at that time, the new songs \\"I want You\\" and the delicious \\"You'll See\\".  This compilation is special because its' the only Madonna album to feature \\"This Used to be My Playground\\".  There are a few dull moments on the compilation including the title song \\"something to remember\\" (from Dick Tracey) and \\"Take A Bow\\" (from Bedtime Stories) but these minor complaints should not put you off adding what many of us consider Part 2 of the Immaculate Collection.   <br /> <br />Madonna remains one of the most important recording artists of the last thirty years. Simply because she has shown many different styles.
0307276902|1.0|I don't doubt the general story is true, but most of it is BS.  I know.  I am an attorney and an alcoholic and have been through rehab.   <br />Its everything a memoir should not be.  Mainly, falsely self-deprecating.  He's such a frigging bad a$$.  He doesn't need a Higher Power to get sober.  He fights everyone and always comes out on top.  5'8, 150# rich boy beating everyone's a$$ and staring everyone down.   <br />My darkest secret is that I beat the hell out of a priest who came on to me.  I'm not sure if he's alive.  Really?  It happened in London, and it isn't verifiable because it was never reported because the priest wouldn't report it for fear of others coming forward.  So, you beat a priest to death in his church office just behind the alter and no one found out about it?  No one heard it?  No one, other than the priest, reported it?  Really?  Is that your story?  How perfect!  That explains your distaste for religion, and its so topical.  I almost want to cheer your revenge for all the priest-molested boys of America and abroad. <br />I was in rehab for four months and in jail for 3 1/2.  I never once introduced myself to anyone and had them tell me to *uck off.  Yet, it happens to him and he does it to others every other day in rehab.  Who talks like that?  Who calls you a mother*ucker?  You'd think he was on death row in San Quentin not a posh rehab on the lake.   <br />Its just macho BS.  He portrays himself as Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson.  He's doesn't say much, but when he does speak everyone listens.  He's hard on the outside, but he has a heart of gold.  It reminds me of so many movies where our hero who is in prison or just from really didn't do it or did it for a good reason.  He killed a guy who was trying to rape a girl or he murdered someone in self defense or it was revenge on someone who killed his wife.  Save it for the *ucking movies.  If I want to see hear that BS, I'll rent a Van Damme movie.   <br />And Leonard . . . how precious.  A gangster with a heart of gold.  That's a new and realistic idea.  He's so mysterious and tough and respected.  That's the spirit of recovery.  Let's idolize the professional criminal.  And how touching, Leonard wants James to be his son.  Why does Leonard love James so much?  Because James is tough and stubborn and has a heart of gold, just like he does.   <br />How disingenuous and blatantly overstated are his legal problems?  He's wanted in three states, all for serious felonies.  (Of course all his crimes are either comical drunk tales where no one is seriously hurt or just plain ole' justified)  Oh no!  What's going to happen?  Imagine that.  Who would have thought?  Two states reduced the charges to misdemeanors and sentenced him to time-served in rehab.  And the tough-on-crime state sentences him to four months in jail and reduces all charges to *ucking misdemeanors.  He committed an assault on a peace officer (while druk driving, no less) and gets a misdemeanor.  Definitely one of the crimes that DA's and judges go easy on.  OK.  But, excuse my sarcasm.  There is a perfectly logical explanation.  A Las Vegas gangster and a federal (not state) judge who he is in rehab with pulled some strings.  Are you *ucking kidding me!  Yeah, federal judges have alot of pull in state courts they don't sit in.  State court judges are so chummy with federal court judges.  And gangsters, in the late 90's no less, can just call in a favor to a judge or DA.  It's so *ucking ridiculous.   <br />But the best part is the moral of the story.  What do we take away from this woeful endearing and hopeful story?  First and foremost, AA is a bunch of BS.  Nancy had it right, just say \\"no\\".  Everyone in the story who believed in AA dies a tragic death, but our protagonist, tough guy James, goes on to live a sober life.  In the conclusion, he walks into a bar (which his brother takes him to straight from rehab with little questioning despite the fact that James is too cool to explain anything to him) and faces down a tall glass of bourbon.  Fury v. James.  Good v. Evil.  Oh yes!  Just say no James, you stud.   <br />No, the best part is when he goes into the scary crack house.  Smacks the john across the face as the john was just about to hit him with a bottle, grabs his love, Lilly, and carries her out to the awaiting van where the two staffers from the rehab await.  These two staffers from a giant expensive beauracratic rehab risk their jobs and take a patient to a crack house to save another patient who has left on her own volition.   I've seen more realistic Three's Company episodes.   <br />I can't believe this book is in the Oprah Book list.  Tragic.  Can't people separate the outrageous true from the outrageous false.  It's not hard.  You take reality and compare it with the story.  If the story defies reality at a much higher rate than reality is usually defied, its probably not true.   <br />Lastly, get a grammar book, James.  Your not Bukowski.  I was more impressed with Augustine Burrough's book, Dry.  Even Wrecking Crew was better.  And, Permanent Midnight was ten times better.  Try Chuck Rosenthal's, Never Let Me Go.  That is a real memoir.      <br /> <br />
0385510454|3.0|As a reward for having one of my book signings at a first class book store in Durham N.C., I got to pick this book as a free gift from the store. I really wanted to read a Grisham thriller. But this is not one.            The slow plot was not a realistic senario that I could believe---Having worked in the Federal Government, I never felt that this story could really happen. Moreover, I agree with the many other people in their Amazon reviews who have mentioned that the author put too much Italian food and travel guide material as filler for this thriller.          However the obvious key mistakes of how Washington works made me write this review. For example, the main person who solves the hero Joel Backman's \\"life or death\\" problem is, according to Grisham, \\"Major Wes Roland... the Head guy\\" of the Defense Intelligence Agency(DIA)----Grisham goes on to tell the reader that Roland has run the DIA for \\"ten, maybe twelve years\\". This is clearly wrong and the author...or his editors should have checked with someone in Washington. DIA, a major Dept of Defense agency, is almost always commanded by a three star General or a Vice Admiral (NEVER a MAJOR). Not to belabor the point, but any career military officer will tell you that a major would NEVER run any world-wide intelligence organization with over 7000 employees (in my view, that number is a sensitive fact unfortunately too easily available on the internet). In addition, any Washington insider knows that DIA directors' tours of command rarely exceed three years.          With major mistakes flawing the too-quick ending and the unrealistic plot, I was one disappointed reader.         In the future, if the climax and answer to your book plot is in Washington, please come to DC, Mr. G, spend a few days talking to some smart people who know how this place really works.           Mr G, I like what I know about you and how you write with a good plot behind you. However this plot is sub-Grisham, so you earn only three stars this time from me (a notorious easy grader!).
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have been listening to this album for the better part of a week now. It is simply fantastic! <br /> <br />Yes.... I have been a Madonna fan since the early 80's - but, I too have had my share of dissapointements - mainly American Life and Bedtime Stories. But THIS ALBUM is one of the best, if not the best Madonna has ever done. As for \\"listenability\\" from beginning to end, for me it is only comparable to Ray of Light. <br /> <br />Madonna is back to the basic \\"grove\\" with this one. I challenge anyone (who is objective anyway) to sit a spell with this and keep from moving!  <br /> <br />My personal favorite tracks are Hung Up, Jump, How High and Let it Will Be. <br /> <br />In today's overly \\"hip-hop\\" environment, this is a sinfully sweet confection that I will be enjoying for quite some time to come. <br />  <br />
B000BGH22W|2.0|This score regrettably fails to deliver.  It has some good (and on occasion impressive) moments; Patrick Doyle's score will most likely work better with the film.  Unfortunately, as a standalone listen, it never reaches the complexity and emotions provided by John Williams' compositions.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am so amazed at how Madonna can still make music after twenty years in the biz. This album is just AMAZING!!! There are no bad songs on this album!!!I even like the \\"dorky\\" lyrics of I Love New York. the songs rocks out. Forbidden Love is amazing. The album is just all around AMAZING!!! <br /> <br />I think even non-Madonna fasn will enjoy it!!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day Concert <br />September 11th is considered a day of remembrance for the tragedy that occurred in New York City.  Many people mourn over loved ones lost in the accident, while others celebrate their memory.  Green Day played an incredible concert dedicated to everyone involved in the disaster.  A feeling of hope spread through the crowd as Green Day performed their songs.  The entire concert was a rollercoaster of emotion; however, it left everyone anticipating what would come next. <br /> Jimmy Eat World opened the concert with upbeat, well known songs.  The crowd was still filing in during Jimmy Eat World's entire set.  Everyone knew that Green Day would soon be on stage.  Green Day is a California based band that has been together for sixteen years.  The lead singer is Billie Joe Armstrong, the bass player is Mike Dirnt, and Tr Cool plays the drums.  By the time Green Day was about to begin the Palace of Auburn Hills was packed with energetic fans.  The concert was sold-out, and 16,000 people were waiting for the arrival of the band.  The atmosphere was teeming with expectation, and then a pink, beer drinking bunny came on stage.  It was hilarious because the bunny really got the crowd into a laid back spirit.  Then out of nowhere the \\"YMCA\\" song came over the speakers, and everyone began dancing along with the bunny.  The pink bunny entertained the crowd and was a pleasant surprise, leaving the audience with no clue as to what would come next.  Many concerts that are too predictable can be boring or tiresome, however, quite the opposite was true with the Green Day concert.  When Green Day came on stage, the crowd was already extremely pumped up, and it seemed as if the band could tell.  Before any songs were even played, Billie Joe got the entire building to do the wave. The wave resulted in every person in the building on their feet screaming for music.  They opened with songs from their new album, including, \\"American Idiot,\\" \\"St. Jimmy,\\" \\"Holiday,\\"and \\"Jesus of Suburbia.\\"  The new album is called American Idiot, and the album won a Grammy for Best Rock Album of 2005.  When Green Day played the first note of \\"American Idiot,\\" the speakers began to vibrate.  There were speakers everywhere, from the floor to the ceiling blaring music.  The sound quality of the band's instruments and the singing of the lyrics was also spectacular.  Many times when a concert is enclosed in a building, it is very hard to hear the words over the bands instruments, but every word of Green Day's songs was heard loud and clear, throughout the entire building.  It seemed as if every person knew all the words to each song and gladly sang along with the band.  American Idiot is an album with a theme behind the lyrics, and the concert took on that theme as well.  During the Green Day concert, Billie Joe made many comments about his dislike for George W. Bush.  He went on to explain that he did not want to force his beliefs on the audience, but he wanted everyone to find something they believed in and fight for it.  Billie Joe's remarks never seemed to offend the crowd; in fact the opposite was true.  When the audience was told to fight for what they believed in, there was a surge of excitement as everyone yelled in agreement.   <br /> As the concert progressed, the fans grew louder and louder, their enthusiasm growing with each song.  Green Day has eight smash albums and they included songs from a variety of them including, \\"Longview,\\" \\"Hitichin A Ride,\\" \\"2000 Light Years Away,\\" and \\"Brain Stew.\\"  In between each song Billie Joe would scream to the crowd to make sure they were still with him, and of course every face was eagerly watching every move the band made.  Not only was the band interesting to watch, but the special effects were enormous.  Green Day included things in their concert that were very original and electrifying.  During the high points in their songs fire works would shoot from the top of their stage, or during the finalnote of a song flames would erupt behind the band.  The music was energizing, and the special effects were stimulating.  After they had played a number of their smash hits, the band decided to bring people on stage that could play instruments.  A guitarist, a drummer, and a bass player were picked from the crowd and quickly taught the song.  Then the crowd watched as a new band was put together in a matter of seconds.  It was a refreshing twist to see that Green Day was comfortable enough to let members of the audience on stage for that once in a life time opportunity.  Those three people were beaming when the song was over.   <br /> All of the songs played at the concert were very exciting but none could compare to the last song.  Green Day acknowledged that it was September 11th, and gave a special tribute to all those who had suffered in New York City.  Billie Joe asked everyone to hold up their lighters or cell phone and sing along to \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends.\\"  Hearing the moving lyrics and looking at the hundreds of lights was extremely emotional.  At this point in the concert it was not about the band anymore, it had become more than that.  Everyone was at the Palace in honor of the heroes, and in memory of those who died just four short years ago. Green Day exited the stage to a thunderous roar from the audience, but of course there was an encore.  The encore consisted of popular songs like \\"Maria,\\" \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" and \\"Time of your Life (Good Riddance),\\" but also included was the song \\"We are the Champions.\\"  Everyone knows that song and if someone didn't, the words were illuminated on a giant screen.  It was a unique way to keep the crowd involved after an amazing two hour show.   <br /> Green Day does not consist of one singer, or one guitar player, they are a talented group of men who put a band together sixteen years ago.  Sixteen years is an eternity to some people, and during that time most people lose friends while picking up newones.  This concert revealed the bond these men share because their music is heart felt, and they work amazingly well together.  If there is ever an opportunity to attend a Green Day concert then go because this concert proved that Green Day knows how to entertain and rock a crowd. <br /> <br />

B000AYEIZY|2.0|This comes across as a MONEY thing...a big stinky business deal. No NEW album, just play the old tunes for the \\"old\\" fans. Yuck! Some of the songs are of course classic, but the performances sound a little tired at times. The sound quality is solid but too clinical sounding for its own good. Like an earlier reviewer wrote: Pick up the early live albums, volume 1 and 2 instead. Now maybe I would have felt different if this was to promote a NEW studio album, but it's all just, nostalgia.<br /><br />My other favorite \\"classic rock\\" band Deep Purple, do have a NEW album, \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" and it truly kicks arse! New material selling close to a million copies already, \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" is one of the finest albums of '05. Bravo DP!<br /><br />What will sadden me is that the media will promote this recycled rubbish from Cream, but completely ignore the innovative and NEW Deep Purple album. Go figure. Talk about the state of the \\"ART!\\"
B000B8QEZG|3.0|If I could I would give this Album 3 and a half stars, but for Amazon's Review I guess it is only best to put 3. <br /> <br />Confessions on a Dance Floor is one of those \\"MUST HAVE\\" albums, for Trance and Madonna Fans. The Album starts off fast paced with the first single \\"Hung up\\".  It's a great pace to start off with, but once you go to the second track, thats where this album lacks luster. <br /> <br />The pace, all of a sudden slows down even though it keeps its dance roots.  The best way to get rid of the sudden change is to listen to the album on shuffle.  Trust me, you will like the album when it's on Shuffle. <br /> <br />If you put aside the Kabbalist chanting at the end of one track and just accept the tracks as is, you can enjoy why Madonna is Madonna.  Best thing about this album it doesn't have a ballad.  No one needs to hear about Esters Tantrums about World peace and hunger. <br /> <br />Bottom Line-3 and a half stars, put the album on shuffle and just \\"let it will be\\".
B00001U0E1|5.0|I did not expect to review this movie, although I knew from the first viewing that I liked it, very much.  The rub is that I know now that I have always loved it, as it insistently has grown continuously with each viewing.  Let me tell you why:<br /><br />· Joseph Fiennes for his boyish vulnerability<br /><br />· Gwyneth Paltrow for her wide-eyed wonder and passion for life<br /><br />· Judith Dench for her Imperial savior faire<br /><br />These above are the exceptional performances<br /><br />· Rupert Everett for his sage demeanor and a certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\"<br /><br />· Ben Afflect for charming impetuousness<br /><br />· Colin Firth for reprehensible chivalry<br /><br />· Geoffrey Rush for his daring love of theatre<br /><br />These are the very, very good supporting roles.<br /><br />This love story is so heartbreaking in such an appealing manner that you are thankful in the end that you experienced such beauty of sadness and may feel as if you can now die having at least loved deeply once.  Of course, this can only apply to those who have loved something (someone) as with one's soul AND to have been loved in return only to realize that eternal concepts such as family, duty, and fate matter more.<br /><br />To quote Viola De Lesseps and William, \\"But it will end well for love.  In Heaven, Perhaps.\\"<br /><br />To quote Viola, \\"I am afeared . . . being in night, all this is but a dream.  Too flattering sweet . . . to be substantial.\\" And also, \\"This is not life, Will.  It is a stolen season.\\"<br /><br />By the spirit of these lines, the tragic play Romeo and Juliet is analogous as subplot within the main story depicting the love of William and Viola.<br /><br />Even though love is lost, it is pleasant to watch the two stories pas de deux in a frenzied fashion with the skill of Nureyev and Fonteyn  justifying Best Picture and Best Actress Oscars (and 5 others).  Sometimes, I wonder who forgot Joseph.  But, maybe I'm just fond of him (See Merchant of Venice).<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you ever were caught up in a \\"stolen season,\\" you will never forget this movie.<br /><br />Not to be missed for the art and language of William Shakespeare for all seasons.ss, if you ever were caught up in a \\"stolen season,\\" you will never forget this movie. <br /> <br />Not to be missed for the art and language of William Shakespeare for all seasons. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is the best i've been listening to it 24/7! Isaak and sorry are the best tracks this is a cd well worth being in your cd collection!

B000B8QEZG|3.0|Alright.  This album, from \\"GO!\\", was always geared towards the dancefloor.  The place she has always done well was the gay market who loves hearing her voice strapped to some thumping beats while at the height of their drug usage.  That's fine.  This album...is dumb.  She capitalizes on a current dance trend (filtered disco tracks from ages ago) while overlaying them with some of the dumbest lyrics ever. <br /> <br />Of course, this doesn't matter because in dance, brains = boring.  Trust me.  A lot of people had trouble with American Life which was, in my opinion, a stellar offering.  This is hard to stomach, as it seems she really dropped the ball on making an intelligent album.  I have noticed, though, she seems to vascillate between a socially poignant album and a commercial album.  I'm hoping her next one is socially poignant. <br /> <br />Some of the lyrics that truly bother me from this album: <br />\\"Life is a paradox and it doesn't make much sense.\\" <br />\\"I don't like cities, But I like new york <br />Other places make me feel like a dork\\" <br />What?  Honestly. <br /> <br />This album is decent for dance fans.  It doesn't offer anything new artistically, lyrically, or musically, but it will do damn well on the dance floor.  Where apparently people confess now.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I had the oppurtunity to listen to Madonna's dance fest..Confessions on a dance floor last night, compliments of Amazon & VH1's free stream and couldn't wait to pick it up today. <br /> <br />\\"Hung up,\\" the album\\"s 1st single, gets the party going and leads us into the cosmic climb of \\"GET TOGETHER.\\"  <br /> <br />From \\"SORRY\\" to \\"JUMP\\" to \\"LET IT WILL BE\\" and right into \\"PUSH,\\" Madonna is back with a disc that will keep the crowds thumping. <br /> <br />Is it a Holiday?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of this series. I ordered the DVD set on a lark. I have always like Science Fiction and have looked for film/video adaptations. I have usually been disappointed but I keep trying. Finding a gem like this one makes the effort worth while. <br /> <br />The basic premise is of the crew of a tramp freighter who make their way by carrying freights, the occasional smuggling job and a few other less than legal operation. These are invariably conducted against people who deserve to have been on the losing side. The captain and first mate are old war buddies. They were both on the losing side of a civil war. The mate is married to the ships pilot. The ship's engineer is a sweet, somewhat nave and technically competent young lady. A tough, mercenary type rounds out the regular crew.  <br /> <br />In the first episode, they take on a series of passengers. One of them is a \\"shepherd\\", which is a sort of itinerant Christian priest. He has a mysterious past we never really learn about. A brother and sister also come on board. The brother is a highly skilled surgeon and the sister is a genius who had secret experiments run on her by government agents. They are on the run from the same government agents. The other \\"permanent\\" passenger is a courtesan. She leases one of the ship's shuttles as her place of business. While the crew is doing their thing, she does hers. <br /> <br />Much of this series seems like a cowboy picture, right down to the horses, saloons and brothels. In a strange way, it works well in the context of the series. It is well done. I am very sorry that the series was cancelled because it is very good. <br /> <br />Synopses of the episodes appear below: <br /> <br /> <br />Serenity - the crew of the Serenity agrees to pick up a less than legal cargo but gets stiffed on their fee when they try to deliver it. Unless they can find somewhere to sell it, they won't have the cash for parts, fuel, salary or anything else. So they try to less it on someborder areas. To help pay the way, they take on some passengers also. One of the passengers turns out to be smuggling a fugitive and another is a federal agent sent to bring in everyone. I get the impression that the government types are not very nice. When you throw in a courtesan, some cannibals and a preacher, things get interesting. <br /> <br />The Train Job - This one seems more like a western but doesn't suffer from that. The crew is hired to rob a train on a frontier planet. The goods they are hired to purloin belong to the Federation government so no one really minds or things it is \\"wrong\\". They also enjoy doing the job right under the noses of Federation troops. The crew doesn't really know what they are stealing. It is only when the train gets to it destination that they learn that they have stolen desperately needed medical supplies. The leads the crew to try to return the goods without getting caught by the feds or the crime boss they were doing job for. This is to be done while the crew is still be pursued by the secret government agency from whom one of the passengers escaped. It's a good and exciting episode. <br /> <br />Bushwhacked - While doing nothing in particular, the crew of the Serenity encounter a derelict floating in space. When they go aboard, they find that the crew has been slaughtered by the Reevers (cannibal lunatics) mentioned in the first episode. They left one survivor and a valuable cargo. The crew attempts to help the survivor and salvage the cargo but their efforts are interrupted by a Federation ship. The captain of that ship assumes that it is the crew of the Serenity who committed the atrocities. The crew have to protect themselves, establish their innocence and hide the fugitives who have become passengers. <br /> <br />Shindig - The crew returns to the planet Persephone, where the series started. They are looking for business opportunities as usual and a possibility pops up. The captain sees an opportunity for a smugglingrun and goes to make contact at a fancy party hosted by the local gentry. To keep this episode interesting, Innarra, the staff courtesan has a date with a local bigwig. He and the captain have a bit of a tiff and wind up in a duel...with swords. There is not a lot of call for swords on spaceships.  <br /> <br />Safe - In seems that nothing can go right. The crew of the Serenity make planetfall with the consignment of cattle they picked up in the last episode and are about to collect their payment. Then things go wrong as they inevitably must. The local law shows up to arrest the cattle buyers just as the money is changing hands and the crew get involved in the shootout. They help out the law but the parson gets himself shot...very seriously shot. The only two missing from the scene are the two fugitives who have wandered off. The captain thinks they might get in the way of the deal making but now the doctor's services are needed. Unfortunately, he and his sister have gotten themselves kidnapped by some religious types who live in the hills. They are glad to have the doctor but they think the sister is a witch and must burn. Saving the preacher and rescuing the siblings proves to be a sticky situation. <br /> <br />Our Mrs. Reynolds - Somehow, we don't really know how, the crew of the Serenity find themselves helping a rural community defend themselves from bandits. After the big celebration, the crew get back on board take of and find that they have an extra passenger. It seems that, according to the local customs, the captain has gotten himself married. That is news to everyone. The young girl is seemingly nave but she is not what she seems. Someone wants the Serenity for scrap.  <br /> <br />Jaynestown - Jayne Cobb is perhaps the least likeable member of the Serenity crew. He is selfish, not too bright and always ready to fight. He has a long history of leaving planets behind while being on the run. In this episode, the crew sets down to pick up an illicit cargoand Jayne is worried because he knows he left the place on the run. He adopts a disguise. Much to everyone's surprise, everyone learns that Jayne Cobb has become a folk hero to the people on the planet complete with a statue in the public square. All of this came about because of a misunderstanding. He never intended to help those people; he did it by accident but he is still a hero. Heroes have people who don't like them and on this planet that include the local magistrate. <br /> <br />Out of Gas - Most series wait until at least the second season before having a retrospective episode. This one takes place halfway through the first season but it has a difference. Instead of recycling footage from old episodes this one has all new footage. The situation involves a serious mechanical failure while the ship is in transit. Life support is failing and the captain sends his crew off in the two shuttles while he stays aboard to try and fix things. While this is going on, we are treated to flashback showing how the crew came to be assembled. <br /> <br />Ariel - When the mysterious female passenger with mental problems starts getting worse, her brother the doctor comes up with a seemingly simple scheme to serve everyone's needs. The crew is to help the doc smuggle sis into a hospital for some tests and the doc agrees to help them steal some high dollar drugs to sell on the fringe planets. These are not recreational pharmaceuticals but vital medicines in short supply. The plan seems to work smoothly until treachery becomes apparent. <br /> <br />War Stories - In the second episode, the crew is hired to pull a train heist. They pull it off but, when all is said and done, they find that they don't want to keep the goods. The natives need the stolen medications more than the crew needs the money. This is all good and noble and such but it hacks of the crime boss who put them up to it. The crew returned the money but the boss wants revenge. In this episode, he manages to capture the captain and the pilot. It is up to the rest of the crew to get them out.  <br /> <br />Trash - A few episodes back, the captain got himself accidentally married. The blushing bride turned out to be a con woman and they only barely got away with their lives and their ship. This time, at a Smuggler rendezvous, the captain runs into an old war buddy who happens to have gotten himself married to the same piece of trash. When the story comes out, the wife gets stranded. Captain Mal is about to strand her as well but she manages to talk him into one of her schemes. Naturally, the \\"lady\\" has an angle of her own. Make that lots of angles...and curves...and treachery. The crew has a few ideas of their own but nothing is going to go as planned. <br /> <br />The Message - When the crew stops at a station for a mail call, they get a surprise. A corpse has been mailed to the captain and Zo. The corpse turns out to be an old war buddy. His last request is that the Serenity take him home for burial. Things are not as they seem, however. The corpse is not dead. Instead, he is smuggling body parts and there are other who want the parts, without the rest of the body. As everyone turns on everyone else over conflicting loyalties, the situation gets tense.  <br /> <br />Heart of Gold - When Inarra, the courtesan, gets a distress call, she talks the crew of Serenity into helping an old friend of hers who is the madam of a bordello on a backwater planet. A local powerbroker with a barren wife want to sire an heir on one of the house girls. He manages to plant his crop and intends to claim it by force. The crew intend to prevent that. And a good time is had by most. <br /> <br />Objects in Space - River, the female fugitive, continues to get more and more erratic. This troubles the crew who fear not only for themselves but for her as well. Things are not helped in that there is a very large reward for her capture. This tends to promote suspicion with many of the people with whichthey deal. In this episode, a bounty hunter manages to sneak aboard and waylay the crew one by one. River, though, is not without her own methods. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The Queen of Pop returns to the disco inferno<br /><br />Back in 1983, when Madonna first burst on the scene, she resurrected dance music which had suffered a decline following its height of popularity in the 70s. The master of reinvention, Madonna has since went on to explore other styles and has displayed deeper meanings in her music. She still knows the value of her roots, however,  and \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" throws aside the spirituality, the Kabalistic karma, etc. for an unabashed dance album. This cd is pure fun, one to crank up and drive by and to put it on at a party and let it play. There are no silent pauses between songs - every song fuses into the next effortlessly.<br /><br />Madonna actually digs deeper into the disco era with many of the songs reminiscent of music from the 70s, before she hit the scene. \\"Hung Up,\\" the first single, samples Abba's \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme\\" and you can catch homage's to the S.O.S. Band in \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Future Lovers\\" certainly has a Donna Summer \\"I Feel Love\\" type of beat. But make no mistake, these are no copycat songs. The only direct sampling here is from Abba - everything else is a unique blend of  throbbing multi-layered tempos and psychedelic overtures.  Every track is \\"catchy\\" but stand-outs include the hypnotic \\"Forbidden Love,\\" \\"Sorry\\" (rumored to be the second single release) and I don't see how anyone could sit still for \\"Jump.\\"
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Yes , I am one of the people who heard all the tracks but who didn't buy this when it first came out because it is a new trend to re-release a CD months after the first. Usher, 50 Cent anyone?? Duh. So I got this version today. Love it like the original. But the Don't forget about us track triggered the purchase. WOW! A little advice for people out there who bought the first one earlier this year, if you are an absolutely hardcore fan of a certain artist, buy the CD when it's released. To everone else always wait for the longer version (at the same price might i add) because labels always try to milk out the rest of the audiences who didn't purchased the CD the first time. See now?? Good.  <br /> <br />Re-Release = Not So Good Stuff; <br />Mariah = Good Stuff; <br />Emacipation of Mimi = Phenominal Stuff; <br /> <br />P.S. If you haven't noticed they do this in response to music piracy. So what lesson have we learned. Burn the first version. If you like it. Buy the second that way everyone's happy <br />

B00005R1N3|1.0|This movie, which I purchased because of rave reviews, has to be one the worst movies of all time, next to Pet Cemetery II. A lot of things unexplained, slow, stupid..... Don't waste your time.
0307276902|2.0|This is the first time I have read three quarters of a book and then flipped to the end, hoping that I would see the main character's attitude change - hoping that he would see some light other than the small, self-centered, self-entitled, arrogant pinlight he claims was all he needed to whip the monster into submission.  Kudos for conquering the addictions.  There's no getting around that - this was a monumental accomplishment, as is every day that he stays clean.  The description of his journey out of the snake pit was eye-opening and probably the only depiction we'll ever need - as we surely won't forget this experience for a long time to come.  I had a mixed reaction because it was amazing to me that, after all of the pain and introspection - and psychiatric digging - James was so stubbornly adamant that he was all he needed to meet this challenge.  James has no need, nor wants a higher power in his existence.  One wonders how he explains his own existence.  Why was it so important to him to belittle the efforts of those who believe in a higher power, and who ask for help through the 12 steps and the AA program?  Something is still wrong with James.  He's lacking one of those million little pieces that completes a decent human being - humility.  Sorry - I'm a bit surprised that Oprah has saluted a person who spits in God's eye - and earns millions flaunting his \\"success\\".  Financial success, certainly.  But doesn't it bother anybody else that James is now on the road telling others how they can do what he did?  Spit in the eye of higher powers and laugh in the faces of authority - do it your own way...good grief!  I guess the message here is that winning at all costs is the goal - how you played the game no longer applies.  Sorry, James - I haven't got time for more of the same in \\"Leonard\\".
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I must say that madonna made a good dance album. Along with stuart price of course! This is madonna at her best! I was afraid the record was gonna come off as predictable and corny as dance music can be at times but she impressed me and this proves that she has something to offer even if it's just dance music. <br /> <br />On the Rolling Stone magazine review it was mentioned that there are no stand out tracks on this album that would be classic dance anthems such as songs in the past like holiday, everybody, and even music. Well thank goodness for that because even without those dance anthems the album still works! And Rolling Stone said the same.  <br />Highlights are: Sorry, Isaac, Push, and let it will be.
0385338082|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Not deep, but quick paced and really funny at times.  I almost put it down about half way through, but was glad I kept reading.
B000021YQV|3.0|I have to admit to being a reverse SOAD fan. I purchased the \\"Mezmerize\\" CD first. I liked what I heard, so I purchase \\"Toxicity.\\"  I see now were SOAD realized what songs worked with \\"Toxicity\\" and produced more songs along that line with \\"Mezmerize.\\" I usually scoff at any new metal bands these days because of the lack of originality, style and staying power. I have always been a RATM supporter, so their split hurt. As a side note, I am still waiting for Zach to due a solo CD. But I do follow Audioslave (Tom Morello works his magic but is still under-utilized!) SO it takes a lot for me to purchase any CD these days.<br /><br />\\"Toxicity\\" was release in 2001 with a mix of hardcore metal songs (Deer Dance, Jet Pilot, X) and those that were experimental (Bounce, Atwa, Psycho) with quirky Middle Eastern vocals. The combination of vocal changes and guitar chord timing is what makes this CD work. \\"Chop Suey\\" and \\"Aerials\\" are examples of songs that were popular. So do what staying power bands do. Build on your success and \\"Mezmerize\\" was born. The most popular song is \\"Toxicity\\" because it is more mainstream and acceptable for radio play.<br /><br />Here is a pet peeve of mine: Does this sound familiar? A lead vocalist is singing in one monotone vocal from the diaphragm \\"Arrrrh Barrrrrrr Rahhhhh HELL Arrrrrh Barrrrrrh,\\" then a single guitar riff chord solo....END. This is a typical metal song from A LOT of so called great metal bands. But to me that is un-original and uninteresting. There might be a market for that somewhere or nowhere.<br /><br />SOAD is not afraid of experimentation. That is a good thing. Their music evolves and is not stagnant. I can't wait for their new release \\"Hypnotize.\\"
B000AL730O|3.0|I think if this was a 5-song extended play disc, I could give it four or five stars. Especially if it was priced at $6 or so. (Actually, as of this writing, a used copy can be purchased for not much more than that.)  <br /> <br />This is a return to form for McCartney, who remains a solid live performer. His albums? Following the excellent Tug of War, it was downhill.  <br /> <br />Honestly, there are two songs I'd rate as equal to his Beatles-era material. Namely, How Kind of You and Anyway.  <br /> <br />How Kind of You is slow and hypnotic, and if Coldplay had recorded a cover of this song, I doubt I would ever suspect they didn't write it, unless I'd heard Paul's original first.  <br /> <br />Anyway is marred by a tacked-on bunch of studio garbage that runs on for three minutes at the end. But apart from that, it is a fitting beautiful orchestral crescendo-building sign-off.  <br /> <br />Fine Line is clever and bouncy and catchy.  <br /> <br />Riding to Vanity Fair is uncharacteristically dark for Paul, but solid material nevertheless. In his Rolling Stone interview McCartney said that when he tries to do angry or emotionally dark music, he usually gets it all wrong. But this time he got it right.  <br /> <br />This Never Happened Before is the sort of shmaltz that Paul gets so much grief about, but shmaltz doesn't get any better than this.  <br /> <br />Producer Nigel Godrich really did make a difference, I think, wrenching the best he could from McCartney. Unfortunately, the juices just aren't flowing like they were in the 1970s, so the other tunes are listenable but not exceptional.  <br /> <br />It's great to hear Paul at the top of his game again, but it's hit and miss. This one will never rank up there with Ram and Band on the Run.
0380789019|5.0|The BEST of Gaiman in novel forum would have to be his beautifully written modern-to-high fantasy novel, Neverwhere. This tale features memorable characters, dark humor, an amazing storyline and a very unsuspecting main character that lives out his days as an ordinary Londoner who is brought into a world he never could have imagined!<br /><br />Truly a remarkable book which will leave you both with smiles and with frowns, Neverwhere delivers as one of Gaiman's best fictional pieces to date! As always you can expect to find lots of thought, creativity, and research put into each and every facet of his novel.<br /><br />If you've never read Gaiman before (and are into moderate-to-high fantasy themed novels set in a modern world), then treat yourself to this delightful story!
B000B8QF14|3.0|I thought this was an excellent DVD/CD set. I just think it could have been A LOT better. <br /> <br />Packaging: 4/5 <br />I would have preferred the set to come in a typical DVD sized case as opposed to a double CD album case. Personal preference, but I think it would look better on my DVD shelf like that. The packaging is nice though. I really like the clear sleeve encasing the cardboard album packaging. The interior packaging? We'll just say it fits with the title. <br /> <br />CD: 5/5 <br />The live album is exactly what one would expect from a live recording. I really don't have much to say except that of everything in this set, it was the only thing I didn't have a complaint about. <br /> <br />DVD: 3/5 <br />I'll start off with the bonus features - a photo gallery. Had some very lovely photos set to the instrumentals for Boulevard of Broken Dreams. All in all, rather boring. You couldn't navigate and it spent what felt like ages on each image. <br /> <br />The DVD itself. The editing was excellent. There were some real creative touches with camera angles that looked like they were lifted from an old television, overhead shots, every angle you could imagine in a widescreen format. Probably the smallest of my problems with the DVD was that the documentary was interlaced between each track so you'd get a song then some behind the scenes and interview footage. The documentary was excellent. It just should have been a bonus feature and not part of the concert. The way it is was rather jarring. <br /> <br />The show was excellent. Just not the best one to showcase the tour, to immortalise on DVD. At least not as the only release. There's many reasons for this, and I will go into all of them. First off, it was filmed at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes. For those unfamiliar with the locale, it is in England. I think it is a great locale for filming - plenty of space for the cameras, thus giving the ability to film a large crowd and have wide, sweeping shots of the stage and audience. The National Bowl has a capacity of around 100,000 spectators. The crowd Green Day performed for the day this was filmed? 65,000. Leaving a lot of open space that was visible and stood out in the wide, sweeping shots of the stage and audience. <br /> <br />Continuing with filming location, by choosing somewhere outside America, you're creating a COMPLETELY different emotional atmosphere for the show. American Idiot is a very highly charged album which reflects the post 9/11 political environment here in the United States. Not that Brits don't understand, because the US is obviously not the only place to have been affected by 9/11 or other terrorist attacks, it just isn't the same. Choosing to put out this UK performance rather than a US performance made the DVD more reminiscent of seeing them in 2002 on the Pop Disaster Tour rather than in 2005 on the American Idiot Tour. <br /> <br />I've listened to the live recording from Leeds from 2004. Excellent recording. Excellent show. I enjoyed it. I saw the AOL Live Webcast of ther show back in September or October. Excellent show, and I could feel the political tension in it. I couldn't quite feel it in this DVD. I saw them live this tour on September 11th. Four years after the attacks. I think of all the shows to be filmed for DVD, to really capture the essence of the American Idiot Tour, it should have been that show. Not because I was there, but because of how charged the atmosphere was. I don't think I need to explain any further on that reasoning. <br /> <br />I also believe that an indoor arena show woul have been better than an outdoor show. A lot of the lighting effects early on in the show were lot to the fact that it was still light outside. The audience wasn't as tightly packed. While I love that there was a crowd of 65,000 - it wasn't a sold out show. While an arena show might only have fit 18,000-22,000 it would have been a tightly packed 18,000-22,000. The show's lighting and pyrotechnics would not have been lost to the daylight. <br /> <br />But for everything that I thought could have been better, I still found the DVD an excellent purchase and enjoyable diversion.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I can't believe I wasted my time watching another one of these \\"epic style\\" movies... after Troy I should have known they were milking it for all it was worth. Actually truth be told I'm a big fan of epic style movies, but unfortunately as of late they've been getting less and less creative and more and more boring. This movie was perhaps the worst epic-style movie I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Beside from the acting performances being lower than 1 star (sorry Jake G, I love you and your sister but you were horrible in this movie), the special effects (what a movie like this should be mainly about) were terrible! I remember hearing people scream out in the movie, \\"Oh those wolves look real!\\" I almost died laughing... sure the scene stopped my heart for a second, but the special effects were REALLY bad... I found it suprising only because it was so sudden.<br /><br />Beside from the special effects the music and storyline were terrible (did this film have music? Actually I don't remember, I guess it was nothing too memorable). The storyline was awful beyond belief.<br /><br />Just an all around bad movie. No offense to those of you who did like it, but I've noticed it is a growing trend for non sci-fi fans to latch onto movies like this for cheap thrills. If this is the type of person you are and the type of films you like, perhaps you'd like to check this title out... it sure is action packed. Since this site is for buying movies though and not renting them, I'm going to have to give this what it deserves... 1 star.
B00080ZG10|3.0|The master of the small movie apparently wants to be the master of the epic film. Unfortunately this is a tall order for anyone, especially for someone who hasn't made a particularly good film (small or epic) since 1990. But at least this time he is trying for a masterpiece and not just pissing away his time with garbage. There will be inevitable comparisons with \\"Citizen Kane\\" (in fact at one point in the film a reference is even made to W.R. Hearst) but anyone who does so should get a reality check. A more appropriate side-by-side comparison would be Tim Burton's \\"Ed Wood\\", and this is a comparison that \\"Aviator\\" loses.    Which is not to say that \\"Aviator\\" is a bad movie, although certainly it is bad history and in need of major trimming. It is generally entertaining fared much better at the box office than expected.     There are a number of flying scenes and two are very good, the night landing on a golf course and the take-off of the Spruce Goose. There are also two that are very weak. The worst is the setting of a new speed record which has a serious continuity error, the plane on the runway was clearly not the plane in the error (bad pun intended). This was so obvious (one had a partial canopy and one had a full canopy) and they cut back and forth so much that I wondered if I was hallucinating the disparity-hard to believe that it was not handled better. The other was the crash of the spy plane in a Hollywood neighborhood. The cartoonish shots of various homeowners watching their houses being destroyed from the inside would fit a Cohn Brothers comedy but are totally out of place in this film.    The film has one great performance, Cate Blanchette channels the vocal patterns and mannerisms of Katherine Hepburn, her scenes are the highlights of the film and fortunately she has a lot of scenes. It took a lot of courage for Scorsese to not just structure the film around someone as familiar as Hepburn but to have her character played in a manner where she was recognizable to her fans.    Alan Alda does great as a slimy senator. Adam Baldwin is slick as the strangely likable Pan Am President. Josie Moran, Kelli Garner and the other Kate (Beckinsale) are dazzling decoration, and Ian Holm provides comic relief. Apparently Scorsese felt he needed this high caliber ensemble to compensate for miscasting the lead.    And miscast he is; from DiCaprio's first line you know that this will be a painful experience; although perhaps not quite as horrible as you would expect from his prior work. Since Scorsese's break with De Niro after Cape Fear, both director and actor have suffered. You have to believe that the replacement DiCaprio takes direction well and that Scorsese is gambling that he can hit a home run with a weak actor and not have to share the credit for his triumph. But his strategy does not work as their screen version of Hughes utterly fails to capture any of the personal magnetism of their subject. I left the theatre thinking how well Titanic Leo executed the role, for his attempt was clearly earnest; but that almost any real actor could have brought nuances to the part well beyond the scope of DiCaprio's abilities-even under Scorsese's direction. The weakness of his portrayal is not as obvious when he is the only one in a scene but it takes on varying degrees of glaring when he is paired with one of the better members of the supporting cast.    I kept coming back to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ed Wood and wishing it was he who was playing Hughes. In real life Wood was a strange guy but almost one-dimensional when compared to Hughes. But if your only exposure to them was these movie biographies you would think that Wood was far more intriguing.     Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
0345404475|5.0|Philip K. Dick's masterpiece, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" is a wonderful read for sci-fi fans, and a curious read for those who are inclined to read philosophical themed-novels. In comparing the novel to the movie Blade Runner by Ridley Scott for a lengthily college assignment I was given, I was immediately swept away in PKD's dark world.<br /><br />Hundreds of quality reviews have been submitted by other reviewers but I have to say that this book is probably one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read. Always ahead of his time, Philip K. Dick paints a strange tale set in a dark world for us. In comparison with the movie (just incase you saw the movie and that's what's attracting you to the book), the book is much more detailed as far as philosophical and political elements go.<br /><br />With everyone having the strange ability to influence their own emotions at the touch of a button (literally an emotion emitter), issues of free will and individual/societal values comes into play. Religious implications and undertones are present throughout the novel as well (in fact in that regard there is a major plot device which offers religion some degree of input in this apocalyptic world - Mercerism).<br /><br />I don't want to give a detailed report of the book only because I think you (the reader) should go out and experience the pleasure of unlocking this gem for your self. The imagery is beautiful as well - a relatively short book as far as most modern say sci-fi books are concerned (and for the most part simply written), this book is bound to appeal to readers of all ages.<br /><br />Truly amazing stuff!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Why waste precious money on this \\"refurbished\\" album when the original is WAY better?
6302732778|5.0|[VHS Release Review]<br /><br />Slow movie but beautifully done (the lighting is absolutely amazing), the film noir-scif-fi classic Blade Runner is an awesome tale from a philosophical stand point as well as an action-drama movie point of view. While the movie can be slow at times, one must take into consideration the year it was made and the book which preceded it.<br /><br />Blade Runner is of course based on (quite loosely) Philip K. Dick's masterpiece, \\"Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" and while in no way does the movie compare to the book, at least in aesthetics (painted by words that is rather than fancy lighting), the story is largely the same if not a bit twisted in it's overall \\"message.\\" Regardless while the movie isn't entirely faithful to the book, it sure presents the moviegoer with some excellent visuals, cool story, and all around excellent balance of fun and serious subject matter.<br /><br />Blade Runner can be extremely slow at times and while Ridley Scott was trying - at the time the film was made - to dazzle the audience with special effects, such effects might come off as overly pretentious. At least the slow gaps in the story sure as hell do, but with a classic, things like this are often overlooked and so to does my review overlook them.<br /><br />Again, great movie - decent enough acting and all around great experience!<br /><br />[DVD Version]<br /><br />The touch ups and scene additions are beautiful - as for what the numbers of other complaints are, I have no clue - I saw the Director's cut on television and so perhaps they omitted sections of that. Either way I saw little wrong with it... perhaps it is or isn't worth the buy, but certainly the VHS is (I'd try to rent the DVD yourself to see what all the fuss is about).<br /><br />Recently I was able to tape record the Director's Cut that was shown on television... no problems that I could see there, perhaps buying the DVD is different though.<br /><br />Either way, a great piece of work!a great piece of work!

1563890119|5.0|An amazing start to one of the greatest high-fantasy series every written. The series itself is full of ripe mythology and creativity (as well as beautiful art), but I digress seeing as how this is mainly about the first installment. Nevertheless, Preludes and Nocturnes stands as one most memorable pieces to date - featuring a cold, efficient Morpheus.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is such a welcome, delicious delight from my #1 (somewhat guilty) pleasure, Madonna.  While I have consistently liked almost all her music, the last few efforts were very hit-or-miss for me.  There were some great songs there (\\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Hollywood\\" come to mind along with a few others), but there were also some serious bombs (in my opinion).  That said, it should be noted that I am a HUGE Madonna fan, owning all of her albums and nearly all of her extended mix single.  She never fails to capture my attention, and this effort is no exception. <br /> <br />This album completely brings me back around, in every sense.  I love the throw-back to the disco era, but love that it is completely translated in today's current \\"disco\\" sound - electronica, my absolute favorite type of music.  Not a single balad, or otherwise downtempo song - pure dance from beginning to end.  I have listed to the entire album this morning while working and feel completely elated.  Madonna's strengths really come through on this one - her mastery of get up, feel good music as well as her unflappable sense of what is \\"next\\".   <br /> <br />If you are even a casual Madonna fan, this is for you.  Easily my favorite Madonna album to date.
0380789035|4.0|Unconventional as most of Gaiman's work, though it might not appeal to everyone! This modern day fantasy tale tells the story of a man named Shadow who was recently let out of jail - he goes through a hell of a lot of badness as soon as he's released and... well, after years of waiting to be released... he essentially has absolutely nothing left to live for.<br /><br />The story is basically about Shadow's life after he leaves prison. The tale, however, is not as simple as that (if that was simple given the fact that Shadow still needs to fill in the rest of his life with something), Shadow comes across unlikely characters along the way. Without giving too much away, expect the strange!<br /><br />Various cultures' mythologies play some role in American Gods; Shadow literally becomes a shadow of this world and enters a new world where epic-level events are occurring. Thankfully this isn't a fantasy novel in the traditional sense; Gaiman does well to keep Shadow's character in tact. He isn't \\"all for\\" the \\"fantasy\\" aspects of the story as they come to pass, in fact Shadow just lets it all flow over him... afraid to embrace the strange realities he's being forced to confront.<br /><br />A story about adapting and adjusting to life's turns (well, in a very extreme way in this case), American Gods is a fun read for anyone who has an interest in the main story and a secondary interest in either sci-fi or fantasy works (this book is not a high fantasy novel as traditional high fantasy works are concerned).<br /><br />Gaiman's masterpiece is so because not only has he transcended his own high-fantasy only writing style (he has written more serious works in the past but they are few compared to his ultra-fantasy writings), but he also provides us with an entertaining ride which is strangely believable!<br /><br />I really wish there was a way to give this book a 4.5... the only major turn off I could think of was that the ending was kind of dragged out. I'm not a big fan of Gaiman endings (with the exception of The Sandman series), but this ending just might come across as silly and poorly executed to some readers.<br /><br />Again though, all and all this was a 5 out of 5 book and worth the buy!!!big fan of Gaiman endings (with the exception of The Sandman series), but this ending just might come across as silly and poorly executed to some readers. <br /> <br />Again though, all and all this was a 5 out of 5 book and worth the buy!!!
B00000253N|5.0|There was once a time when I looked down on Bob Dylan's music and riduculed him as a talentless musician.  One album single-handedly swayed my opinion and forced me to realize his remarkable brilliance.  That album is Blood on the Tracks.  It is quite possibly the most perfect album I have ever heard, and if there has ever been a better album lyrically made, I haven't heard it.  The personal turmoil that Dylan was going through when he made BotT has been well documented, but it still fails to prepare the listener for the absolutely heart-wrenching personal struggle that he lays bare over the course of ten tracks.  Every song demands to be heard again and again, and I myself couldn't resist those demands.  The musical arrangements are often minimal and simplistic, but his pain and his genius ring as loud as any heavy metal out there.  Bob Dylan had gems before BotT and he's had some since, but for me this is his finest hour.  I couldn't imagine my music collection without it, and frankly I don't want to.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I was a little skeptical of buying this CD, after all, I wasn't too impressed with American Life.  Not because that wasn't a good CD but because it simply contained too many serious issues which I wasn't happy getting from the reigning queen of POP.  Pop is supposed to be fun, electrifying, exciting music.. boy, does this new album delivers all those! <br /> <br />If you've liked Madonna's music prior to American Life, I suggest you give this CD a go, you will not be disappointed! <br /> <br />
B000000W5P|5.0|By 1978, the Stones were so immersed in drugs and internal turmoil that they had every excuse to make a lousy record.  Instead, they made Some Girls.  How they managed to pull it off I'll never know, but it's one of their very best.  In addition to hammering out their trademark, gritty sound, the boys take their shots at the rising arenas of punk and disco with memorable results.  Miss You and Beast of Burden are the tracks that everyone knows from SG, but the inspired filler in between is golden.  Check out the country twang of Far Away Eyes, the out-of-control wall of noise that is Respectable and Lies, and the immaculate cover of the Temptation's Just My Imagination and you'll be smiling for days.  They've had some high points since then, but in many ways Some Girls marked the zenith of the Stones' long career. After this, they were never as fun or relevant again.
B000002H6C|5.0|First of all, if an album is this great, then perhaps the production was perfect.  In a way, I think the fact that the bass was so low adds to the uniqueness of this album.  It is a very serious, mechanical, militaristic, angry album and I wouldn't want it any other way. <br /> <br />Ok, now that I got that out, \\"And Justice for All\\" stands with \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride The Lightening\\" as not only my favorite Metallica albums but also some of my favorite albums of all time.  \\"And Justice For All\\" is brilliant.  It feels that every note played was deliberate, each word that James sings is so powerful, sincere, unforgiving.  I still get chills when the lyrics come in during the title track.  THIS IS WHAT MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT!   <br /> <br />I absolutely love \\"Eye of the Beholder\\".  That song has so much meaning to me and I love how the song fades in at the beginning.  The changes are perfect.  \\"Dyers Eve\\" is a classic much on the same lines as \\"Damage Inc.\\" off off Master of Puppets.  As is \\"Blackened\\" much like \\"Battery\\". <br /> <br />For all the misteps Metallica took after this album (even though there are some good songs on The Black Album), they are still one of my favorite bands, if not my favorite, of all time.  And I don't listen to a lot of metal bands out there.  Metallica was the best band during the 80s and there haven't been many bands since that have reached their level (other than maybe Tool, Radiohead and Queens of the Stone Age) since.   <br /> <br />I guess, if asked that age-old question of which albums I would take with me if I were to be stranded on a deserted island, \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"And Justice For All\\" and \\"Ride The Lightening\\" would surely be at the top.  They're amongst the albums that come closest to being albums I could not live without. <br /> <br />
B000AMJDHY|2.0|~*Note: I actually give this 2 1/2 stars*~    I know i'm going to catch alot of heat for this, but i don't think these guys are anywhere near as good as FOB, The academy (is...) or even the audition ~*fellow chi-town peers*~.     The problem (?)    It seems like P! tried to cram too many different musical influences into this 11 song disc. Traces of techno, r&b and even ska can be heard in between the standard guitar and bass.     (Why is that a problem, sir?)    Well, for one, i'm not big on ska, techno or r&b. Call me crazy, but i'd prefer plain old pop-rock any day of the week.     (Why else?)    Hmm, the music could be catchier? Don't get we wrong, some of the hooks on ~*fever*~ are downright intoxicating, but even after numerous listens, I was hard pressed to find more than 3 songs i really, REALLY liked.     (Why else, else?)     Er, the vocalist sounds too much like stump from FOB? Yeah, that's it, they're pretty similar. I usually don't ~*dislike*~ a band based on their vocalist, but something bothers me about the almost TOO similar sound P! carries to FOB vocally.    (?)    Yeah, okay, so maybe those aren't the best lines to argue against the purchase of ~*fever*~, but atleast I'm being honest. Most people will just *give* anything under the sun 5 stars based only on it's popularity. I, however, prefer to listen for myself instead of making assumptions.    (To Assume *makes an* ASS *out of* U (and) ME)    So at the end of the day, all i can do is give you my opinion. If you're looking for something equiped with lots of experimentation and a sound not being done by a million other bands, get ~*a fever you can't sweat out*~. If you'd rather be safe than sorry, check out TheAUDITION's *Controversy <3's Company*.    (theAUDTION owns by the way)    I'd be the first to admit that P! is very unique, more so than 80% of whats out there, but really, is that *the only thing* that makes music worth listening to (?)

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Her last album \\"American Life\\" was a dismal failure by Madonna's stratospheric sales standards. It posted the lowest sales of any Madonna album - only 657,000 copies to date. The album was an odd mix of techno and acoustic music with serious attempts at political commentary and spirituality. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a return to a genre that she is both familiar with and successful in - the dance song. It works! This is Madonna firing with both barrels of her leather bustier!    There are still a few references to her Kabala based spirituality, but they are buried so far down in the grooves that they are barely noticeable. What is noticeable is the catchy beat that permeates this record like the bubbles of a fine Champaign - light, crisp, and effervescent.     The first single \\"Hung Up\\" could have been as big a hit in 1982 as it should be today. Madonna's singing has improved much from her early days and she has not lost her ability to express an almost atmospheric sense of joy with her voice. The rest of the album is just as catchy and listenable.    Can Madonna save the world with her songs? Maybe not, but there is nothing like a good beat to get your body moving and shake off the problems of the day, and that is a \\"dance step\\" in the right direction.
B000B8QF00|5.0|I am a huge Alanis fan from Turkey and I ordered the limited edition so I will receive \\"the collection\\" on december. But as I know all of her songs I can write a goosd review. First I like to start with the cover. It is very well designed. There is a lack of new stuff (mercy and crazy are not enough. there should be at least 2 previously unreleased songs). And I think track listing is not well organised. The songs chosen from \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" are okay but choices from the other albums are just not good enough to be in ther collection. I would choos \\"a man\\" \\"fear of bliss\\" \\"excuses\\" and \\"no pressure over cappucino\\" instead of \\"simple together\\", \\"so unsexy\\" and \\"sister blister\\". I would give 5 stars to everything that Alanis made but I think buying the limited edition would be a better choice since you get a DVD and a 16-page-booklet.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It took my daughter 1 year to get me to watch this. I wrote three reviews and trashed them all. It's hard to summarize what is so good about this movie.     This movie is unique. Forget the plot; it is a character study of very small town America. The humour is in the ridiculous traits and behavior of some of these desparate people. It's somewhere between Green Acres and Fargo with the charm and low budget, non-Hollywood appeal of Home Alone and the Gods Must be Crazy.     Don't take it too seriously. This movie is extremely funny; you won't be able to get these characters out of your mind for a long time. In fact the thing that stuck me the most was 'where did they get these actors'. Napoleon, Kip, Rico and Lafawndah are brilliant in their roles. Like 'George McFly' in Back to the Future they are just hilarious to listen to and look at. The deadpan deliveries, the words they use, will have you laughing for days.

It's beautiful, epic, and infectious. Once it's in your head it stays there. <br /> <br />3. \\"Sorry\\" - The chorus alone grabs you and pulls you into this track. <br /> <br />8. \\"Jump\\" - Feels like dancing under falling stars of light. She asks if \\"your ready to jump\\", yes we are. <br /> <br />10. \\"Isaac\\" - A beautiful return to the \\"Ray of Light\\" sessions. Forget he media back story about this track. It's pure melodramatic music. <br /> <br />11. \\"Push\\" - I don't what is is about this track that makes me like it so much. Is it the lyrics? How about the beat and background music? Whatever it is I can't help it. <br /> <br />Thanks Madonna for making my winter a whole lot warmer. Your music continues to take me places very few artist's can.
0525457585|3.0|This book is alot longer than the beloved movie version, but fantastic nonetheless. <br /> <br />I was disappointed when my faovrite scenes weren't in the book: <br /> <br />\\"Atreyu, why are you so sad?\\" <br /> <br />(sobbing) \\"I've failed you, Empress!\\" <br /> <br />(she smiles) \\"No . . . you haven't.\\" <br /> <br />Yeah, I'm a nerd and I love the end of the movie. But let's not toss aside the book. It's wonderful because not only does all the cool stuff in the movie happen, but once sebastian has saved Fantasia, he gets to have his own written adventures in the imagined world. <br /> <br />I can't remember, but I believe there was a battle with a witch and her giants, an archy contest, and much more, before Sebastian finally learns what he came to Fantasia to learn and is sent home to his father -- who awakens from the grief of lossing his wife and remembers his son. <br /> <br />If you love fantasy and adventure, check this book out, even if you don't buy it right away.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Being a fan of dance records, I was disappointed in this record.  And no, I'm not one of those Team L.A.M.B. trolls that want to give one star to an album because I like Mariah Carey and I hate Madonna.  (For the record, I like both artists and I like the majority of their catalogs.  I am saddened that people want to give one star because they just hate an artist and five stars to brag about how wonderful their artist is instead of focusing on a review, but it happens here at Amazon.com all the time.)  I've  listened to Confessions on a Dance Floor three times, and I just can't get into it.  I like Stuart Price's work as Les Rythmes Digitales and with Zoot Woman, but I was underwhelmed with his  production on this album.  I appreciate the fact that Price thought of the idea of mixing the songs together to make a continuous dance album, but his production tends to make Madonna's vocals sound weaker than they already are.  Also I find Price's work less soulful and less reflective of disco than some other artists that have put out mock-disco albums such as Luke Vibert (as Kerrier District) and the recently-released Love Songs of the Hanging Gardens by Kelley Polar (which I feel no one will get because, well, Vibert and Polar aren't Madonna).  None of the songs stay in my head except for \\"Hung Up\\" because of its ABBA sample, \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Issac.\\"  As a long time dance music and Madonna fan, I think this is an okay album, but it pales in comparison to other mock-disco albums and Madonna's own Ray of Light.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's official: Madonna's fans have received the continuous-mix ear candy they have demanded as a ransom for continued devotion, even if Confessions On A Dance Floor turns out to be anything but superficial. She's sneaky like that. There is a lot going on under that sequin-covered disco cap. I already wrote this on my TypePad blog \\"boy culture,\\" but why bother surfing the Net when you can find out right here: Overall CD Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> <br />TRACK BY TRACK <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\" <br />The album opens with the ticking of a clock, gutsy for a 47-year-old in a field where her rivals are in their teens and twenties. Though she claims that \\"time goes by so slowly,\\" the exact opposite impression is conveyed, a sense that if you don't seize the moment, it will pass you by. This feeling is helped along by the legendary call to action that is ABBA's bassline from \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight),\\" sampled here to the point of saturation. In the original, it was \\"half past twelve,\\" while in \\"Hung Up\\" it's \\"a quarter to two\\"-maybe time really does go slowly, since in the 26 years from the original's invention to \\"Hung Up\\"'s addictive reinvention, only an hour and 15 minutes have elapsed! The song is an irresistible pop perfect storm with a stop-start quality that manipulates you as easily as the tide toying with driftwood. It's musical crack, and if there is anything to complain about, it's that it's so exactly what the doctor ordered that it's not as surprising as previous lead singles from \\"Like A Virgin\\" to \\"Like A Prayer\\" to \\"Music.\\" At one point in \\"Hung Up,\\" Madonna sings with conviction, \\"I don't know what to do.\\" It's a lie. She knows. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Get Together\\" <br />I've never heard a more perfect club song than this euphoric piece, which drips with a sexuality so open it's innocent and begins with a ringing bell that could either be a neat outro providing closure to \\"Hung Up\\"'s 60 Minutes intro or a school bell indicating class is in session/let recess begin. Recalling Stardust's \\"Music Sounds Better With You\\" (itself known to have had a passionate affair with Madonna's seminal hit \\"Holiday\\"), \\"Get Together\\" exudes optimism, boiling down club-hopping to love-seeking. The song is a fantastic example of Madonna's songwriting abilities-here, she writes simply but with feeling: \\"Can we get together?/I really wanna be with you/c'mon check it out with me/I hope you feel the same way, too.\\" This chorus perfectly communicates what we all seek in the darkness of a club-and in life. What else is there? 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Sorry\\" <br />Rumored to be the set's second single, \\"Sorry\\" is, ironically, another unapologetic vacation for the mind and draft notice for the feet. Opening with Madonna murmuring \\"I'm sorry\\" (or close to it) in several different languages, the song zips along aerobically, as if it were a long-lost Flashdance soundtrack cut. I hear this as a vastly improved take on her admittedly pleasing Erotica tracks \\"Thief of Hearts\\" and \\"Words.\\" Madonna has held out a long time without a classic woman-scorned kiss-off song (\\"You'll See\\" came close). If she was waiting for a worthy cut, her patience pays off with an absolutely grade-A entry in the genre. Pet Shop Boys could have written this for Madonna-it's that good. If this isn't a hit, Billboard is no longer worthy of existing and a flamer fatwa should be called on all radio programmers. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Future Lovers\\" <br />A dark-horse candidate for my favorite track on Confessions is this fabulous-in both the gay and non-gay ways-concoction, which finally perfects the psychedelic grandiosity Madonna has occasionally toyed with, notably on \\"Up Down Suite,\\" \\"Bedtime Story,\\" parts of Ray of Light and the enjoyable but somewhat stunted \\"Impressive Instant.\\" While \\"Hung Up\\" arguably fails to wrestle control of its muscular ABBA sample, \\"Future Lovers\\" washes over a soundalike bassline from Giorgio Moroder's \\"I Feel Love,\\" managing to rekindle the excitement generated by Donna Summer's vocal with a completely different, revelatory narrative. Here, Madonna speak-sings, \\"I'm gonna tell you about love\\" (a dozen years after `teaching us how to' you know what on \\"Erotica\\") like a sexy HAL-let's agree to call this song's feminine narrator SAL. When Madonna sings \\"in the evidence of its brilliance\\" with the shrill, almost tinny urgency first heard on \\"Mother and Father,\\" the effect is very different-it's not gut-level intimacy, it's the opposite, a proclamation of the connectedness of the cosmos. Like an astral tour guide (or a drug dealer), Madonna flirtatiously asks, \\"Would you like to try?\\" Who wouldn't? Andy Warhol said, \\"In the future, everybody will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\\" Instead, perhaps in the future everybody will be lovers for 15 minutes. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"I Love New York\\" <br />The nearly perfect ride through the first four tracks is interrupted by this detour. Early pro reviews raved about this tribute to the city that never sleeps (hey, if Madonna can use clichs, so can I) while early fan reaction has been more mixed, running from ranking it a ways down the list of fave songs on the CD to being embarrassed for Madonna over this clunky American Life illegitimate child. <br />The deftly spare lyrical quality that shines on other songs is supplanted here by a clumsy, juvenile approach that gives birth to you'll-never-live-this-one-down lines like, \\"I don't like cities, but I like New York/other places make me feel like a dork.\\" Dork is a fine enough word, but I think most people who are in love with and in awe of New York would agree that spending a little time here is what makes you feel like a dork, and you feel pretty darn jaded elsewhere. The song is saved from becoming the next \\"I'm So Stupid\\" with a killer chorus, an exhilarating demand to \\"get off my street,\\" Cure-ish guitars and a '60s instrumental wash that evokes images of a beautiful stranger dancing the pony. Is it enough to win youover? Love it or hate it, mad, sad or glad, \\"I Love New York\\" definitely stops traffic-and that's no good when the rest of your CD is a runaway train. I don't despise this song, but I still kinda wish it would F off. Though while we're talking about lyrics, why is no one complaining about \\"my humps, my humps, my humps?\\" 6.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Let It Will Be\\" <br />This is an odd duck [say it with faux British accent], and not only for the completely unnecessary and (unless I'm missing it) meaningless extra word in the title. Am I insane to be reminded of Iam Siam's \\"She Went Pop?\\" It has an arresting opening that mimics \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" or even\\"Dear Jessie\\" and a vocal with a palpable sense of narrative urgency. \\"Now I can tell you/about success, about fame,\\" Madonna growls, as if relieved to have the good times of the previous tracks behind her as a synthesized cowbell clangs somewhere in the mix. \\"The place that I belong/it won't last long/the lights they will turn down\\" she predicts like a disco Nostradamus. But though she could easily launch into a sermon, she instead preaches to the choir with a prettied up take on a theme stars visit far too often in their work-the dangers of fame, the insubstantial nature of having it all. If this message were broadened to include the kind of success mere mortals are more likely to be inflicted with, maybe. But she's saved by the music and has never sounded more righteous than when she spits, \\"Just watch me burn!\\" Our own little Ciccone of Arc, aflame at the stake of criticism. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Forbidden Love\\" <br />This charming electro Romeo & Juliet gives me fever-it could be the promise of \\"Future Lovers\\" realized, yet also continues Madonna's more old-fashioned appreciation for a boy and girl in love started in \\"La Isla Bonita.\\" We enter on an odd horn sound that's both playful and desolate, making it easy to envision a video staged on Mars with kisses bestowed from inside spacesuits. It builds to an aural crescendo that lovingly capitulates Moroder's Metropolis work with Queen. Three minutes in, the beat sounds like \\"Vogue,\\" fitting for a song that could reasonably be read as an ode to star-crossed gay lovers or, with more effort, chalked up to the gay-marriage debate-either way, it's hard to resist the urge to chant \\"menergy\\" as you play it. One Madonna song it sounds nothing like is Madonna's own 1994 tune \\"Forbidden Love\\"-I don't count this as self-reflexivity because I'd bet money she simply forgot she was recycling a title. Shimmery and adorable. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Jump\\" <br />This kinetic construction is single-worthy for being catchy and universal and yet fresh. Longtime fans will be shocked to hear the raspy spoken-word introduction, which sounds like a throwback to \\"poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permission of another.\\" This time around, Madonna's saying, \\"There's only so much you can learn in one place/the more that I wait, the more time that I waste,\\" re-emphasizing an Alice In Wonderland \\"I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date\\" theme begun in \\"Hung Up.\\" Further in, the song becomes a semi-remake of \\"Keep It Together\\" with its high praise for family and paraphrasing of Sister Sledge's \\"We Are Family.\\" Engaging songwriting like \\"life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree/it sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see\\" is brought to life with the most direct vocal on the album. Madonna's pride for her handiwork leaps through. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"How High\\" <br />A natural progression from a song called \\"Jump,\\" \\"How High\\" is infinitely more pensive. Madonna again returns to questioning fame and fortune, wondering \\"how high?/outer space!/how much fortune can you make?\\" Of achieving her goal of \\"wanting to be talked about,\\" Madonna bitterly admits, \\"I did it/was it all worth it?/and how did I earn it?/nobody's perfect/I guess I deserve it.\\" But while this could be read as Madonna giving herself permission to enjoy her lofty status, it sounds more to me like a very unconvinced \\"I guess I deserve it.\\" Lyrically smart and musically interesting, the song nevertheless fails to live up to its brilliant bookends and isn't half the song that Music's \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" is. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Isaac\\" <br />\\"Those naughty rabbis\\" took exception when they heard rumors Madonna had named this poorly titled song after Isaac Luria, a 16th Century mystic, and the media decided that the flap somehow meant the song was \\"controversial.\\" This gorgeous masterpiece of a song hasn't got a chance to rise above its silly pre-publicity and be accepted on its own, which is a shame because it's a lush Middle Eastern-flavored gem that's the spawn of \\"Frozen\\" and Sting's \\"Desert Rose\\" with the moaning from \\"Secret\\" thrown in for good measure. Going into the third decade of her career, Madonna is still unafraid to seem pretentious, and that's good because otherwise we might never have had this whirling-dervish slice of musical nirvana. Anyone who hates this is probably hating it out of the mistaken belief that liking it would mean being fooled by Kabbalah. Had this song been named something else and failed to attract the attention of a few self-appointed keepers of Judaism (who leaked it to them so far in advance of whoever leaked it to me?), this could have been a brilliant single. Seriously! 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Push\\" <br />Madonna has announced that this is a love song to her special Guy. It reminds me of Like a Prayer's Prince-ly \\"Love Song\\" and its challenging \\"Act of Contrition,\\" complete with backward-sounding music and a consistent feeling of struggle. There is a slave-galley rhythm and both the delivery and content of the lyrics communicate effort. Words fall across one another in a jumble like hikers taking a tumble. (Now I'm writing Madonna's next album.) Progress is made, which is good since the song definitely feels like climbing a mountain in 3:45. Quoting The Police's \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and perhapssome Tom Tom Club, the song is certainly not as inaccessible as a mountain aerie. Some hear this as a good single for the American market. I'm still trying to convince myself it's a good album track. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Like It Or Not\\" <br />It's brand new and yet I feel this song is already underrated. Sure, Madonna has dished out cheek before-mission statements you can dance to like \\"Human Nature\\" have been a large part of her work. But the genius of this song is that while knowing it's coming from Madonna gives it a kick, it is not specific to Madonna's singular experience. It's a wonderful anthem for those who live their lives with no regard for the small minds around them, and for those who wish to God they could. A flash of \\"Die Another Day\\" at the beginning winds down into an almost exact regurgitation of the opening of \\"Frozen\\" (again with the \\"Frozen!\\") before completely about-facing into a giddy declaration of independence set to a clapping percussive beat-if you can close your eyes and picture Madonna snapping her fingers to this and dancing like a Shark or a Jet, you might agree with me when I say I can only believe this song was inspired by her abortive work on the shrugged-off Texas Guinan movie musical Hello, Suckers! The song already role-calls femmes fatales Cleopatra and Mata Hari (Evita is there in spirit), so Tex would fit right in. Regrettably, a lazy lyric like \\"sticks and stones will break my bones\\" detracts from a juicy one like \\"I'll be the garden/you'll be the snake/all of my fruit is yours to take/better the devil that you know/your love for me will grow.\\" Madonna's vocal is reminiscent of \\"He's A Man,\\" especially on that line, and the galloping bassline is a '70s Amii Stewart lark-you better knock, knock, knock on wood, Madonna, that our love for you will grow. But so far, so good. 9/10
B000B8QEZG|3.0|This album is OK. This is her 1st album that didn't instantly grab me. Yes, the production is excellent, but who really cares about that if the songs aren't enjoyable. The 1st 3 songs are hands down the best, then after that it just a blended stew of lameness. And what is with the song \\"Push\\". Am I the only one that thinks of Mariah Carey or J.LO when I hear it? And \\"Jump\\", eww, not a good song, it sounds so weak. It's almost a joke. I love Ray Of Light (everyone seems to compare it to that album), which if Ray Of Light was a person, it should be very offended. Oh, and I thought American Life was great, diffently a fav. I don't know what else to say. I've come to the conclusion that, maybe I'm just not gay enough for this CD.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the year - and not only in dance music. The music is mesmerizing, Madonna sounds amazing, the production is beyong words: each track is very melodic and sounds retro but at the same time has an edge and futuristic vibe. Madonna doesn't compare with any other pop artist in the world. She a category herself. And she doesn't need the chart sucess to prove herself anymore - although early indications show that she will be on top of the charts all over the world with this record. Personal favorites: Get Together, Sorry, Isaac, I Love New York.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|this album is amazing. I wasnt expecting it to be this good after her last album. it doesnt just make me want to dance...it makes me want to dance for my life, for personal freedom, for the good of the world. I am so inspired. Jump, get Together and forbidden Love are my faves.
0060825219|4.0|Like many other reviewers that preceeded me, I am a longtime admirer of Coelho's books. From the time he wrote \\"The Alchemist\\" to \\"Eleven Minutes\\", his writing seemed to only get better. After I learned about the publication of \\"The Zahir\\" earlier in 2005, I made it a must to read it.<br /><br />I was dissapointed for most of the book. By the time I reached two thirds of it, I had spotted the pearls of wisdom that Coelho has gotten us used to. But the book failed to retain my interest. In Amazon-speak, at that point it was not more than a three-star book. But I must acknowledge that the latter third of the book made me pick it up with more excitement about what was left. Without going too much into the story (which you probably know by now), it was at this point that his storytelling abilities really started to shine, like in the best of his works, getting to the peak of his potential toward the last few pages.<br /><br />If you are no die hard fan of his work (or any author's work, for the matter), I doubt you will be willing to wait \\"so long\\" before you loose your interest in it. Therefore, I can only give it four stars. For Coelho's best works, go to \\"Veronika Decides to Die\\", \\"The Devil and Miss Prym\\", \\"Eleven Minutes\\" or \\"The Pilgrimage\\".
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This really is a hilarious movie.  Some people seem to think that there was no effort or thought put into this movie, but those people really do not see the genius in this movie.  Just like the most recent episodes of South Park, Team America takes a stance on political issues not for or against any side, but simply bashing everyone involved.  Also, to the great reviewer LMP784 \\"LMP\\", it is quite funny that you describe this movie with the phrase \\"no intelligence at all\\".  Apparently alot of people think that about you also.  \\"The only funny thing was the President of China's song - where every 'L' is pronounced 'R'.\\"  Kim Jong Il is the dictator of North Korea.  He has nothing to do with China.  Perhaps you need to get in check with your own \\"intelligence\\" before giving a good movie a bad review.  Do not listen to people like him, this movie is like nothing you've ever seen and you will laugh.  However, if you don't like South Park, then you probably won't like this either.
B000B8QF00|4.0|The track list looks very good, covering almost all of Alanis' hits.  The glaring omission is 'Unsent'.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Here it comes again. I got suckered into buying the new Depeche Mode from reading reviews of their new \\"Playing the Angel\\" and actually believing that they maaaaybe made a CD as good as \\"Violater.\\"  Bottom line is there are two good songs on that CD...the singles obviously.  And now I get suckered into buying the new Madonna.  Thankfully not a ballad in sight, but some snoozers nonetheless.  Actually I'm trying to pretend I'm listening to Kylie Minogue because the Disco Dolly ripoff has come full circle.  First Madonna exploded out in the 80s, then Minogue started serving up some sugar sweet dance pop much in the same vain, Madonna branches off and fakes a british accent, does Evita (yach!) and you know that song with Baby Face and pretty much doesn't do anything dancey and worthwhile post Vogue until \\"Ray of Light\\" in all its electro schlock glory.  While Madonna is doing this Minogue is still cranking out fun and intelligent dance music.  Only Erasure has stayed as true to dance pop as Minogue and...sorry all you Madonna fanatics, she rips off both of them here.  hard.  \\"Hung Up\\" is good, but gimme, gimme, gimme a break it should be good! It's sampling ABBA!  There are like 2 or 3 other tracks that are worthwhile weapons in your boys/girls night out and they can be downloaded (via Itunes if you feel guilty).  Don't buy this entire album. And don't believe the hype.  Just because someone has put out some very good music in the past doesn't make them infallible. Case in point rhyming \\"I love New York\\" with \\"other cities make me feel like a dork.\\"  Look I know she's not Shakespeare but hell \\"Ray of Light\\" was a bit more headsy, not much granted.  Scratch this album and grab the new Goldfrapp.  Madonna don't do electro like Allison.
B00005JKCH|5.0|<br /> <br />Well... If there was ever a Superhero Movie.... well, then I guess we have found it. Spider-Man since the late 80s has been a Highly anticipated Comic-book hero to hit the screen, and in the 80s with the release of the Highly rated \\"Batman\\" film Directed by Tim Burton (See Batman Review)  <br /> <br />Stan Lee Quote: \\"Me and Bob(Kane) often teased each other about who's comic-book action heroes would reach the silver-screen first, him being Lucky he beat me to it\\" <br /> <br />I must say, as my honest Opinion Seeing the film myself in the Cinema/Theatre 3 times I have never lost any interest in the Brightly colorful, and unique Super-hero based film <br /> <br />Tobey Maguire quote: \\"It's Not even just a Super-hero movie it's a story about two people in love too\\". <br /> <br />This just goes to show that Spider-Man not only provides a Action film but also a love story. A must for the family DVD collection, Spidey hits home through any occasion or event most definitley one for the holidays. <br /> <br />Overall View: 10/10
B000B8QEZG|1.0|This Album is horribley dissapointing..You can find these beats, which are mostly sampled from superior artists, ANYWHERE in ANY dance song..Un-Original and Madonna's voice has seen better days..Hung Up is okay and Isaac is alright..the rest sound the same and literally blend together..
B000B8QEZG|5.0|If you are going to trash someone, at least be tactful. Your pattern of nicknames and comments is just wayyy obvious, and for once - at least have some guts to use your real names. When Madonna trashes someone, she does it with pride and dignity.    Obviously she is now a real threat as the biggest album/comeback of the year,  but you know what, why don't we just sit back and let their music speak for themselves - in a fair and civilised manner. Your dirty tricks are just wayyyy low, that even mariah herself would not want to have anything to do with you. I am infact a Mariah's admirer as she is a great singer, sad that she has some really crook fans.    BTW, I'm totally blown away by her madgesty's new album I'm still quite speechless about it atm lol. Each song has it's brief and simple statement - that is never preachy - something that makes American life an uncomfortable listening to some.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|What a great YEAR it is has been for Mariah and the Awards and Accolades are just beginning for her..She is the New Queen..and Shows all thge other fakes how its done.....Me and Mariah Belong Together....
0812550706|1.0|I would give this book 2 stars but today I am not in the mood to be nice to it. To start this book fails to represent the science fiction genre as it's character development is weak/ nonexistent and it's plot is drivel at best. Ender is a 6 year old genius who is monitored and then selected by the military to go into their space training program to fight an alien race known as buggers. The training ends up just being some stupid and useless laser tag game. In which you end up reading about for half of the book. Ender's unstoppable strategies are nothing amazing and it is like Card wants everyone else to look like complete idiots. Ender's \\"genius\\" could be seen as something as simple as not lining up all of your troops like in old times. Through out the story there are so many holes but it seems Card's only excuse is... \\"genius\\". Ender for instance is like a god in that no one esle can compare to his no experience required knowledge. I guess this book is aimed at the young self perceived genius. The biggest part of  fiction in this book is how his two siblings split the world opinion in half and end up taking over the world by what they post on internet....LAUGHABLE Also his big bad last \\"test\\" is a joke as he just uses some huge chain reaction with a weapon that can destroy planets....When he is told what those little lights on the screen are  I can hear that awful, cheesy \\"noooooooo\\" off of the latest star wars movie.
B000002I2I|5.0|Most divers album of the Doors. This album sometimes sounds to me like a compilation of leftovers from other albums together with a few new songs. Pretty good leftovers. Waiting For The Sun (not only because it's titel but also because of the way the song is recorded), Blue Sunday and The Spy fit in perfectly with the material of the album Waiting For The Sun. Indian Summer sounds like The End from the first album. You Make Me Real would've done it good on Strange Days. Ship Of Fools and Land Ho! are also songs that remind us of the first three albums. Roadhouse Blues fits in with the live material. Peace Frog, Queen Of The Highway and Maggie McGill are the newer studiosongs the Doors started making since the period of The Soft Parade. <br />We hear a good band, playing good short popsongs. But it's more back to the basics than that creating a whole new sound like they did on The Soft Parade and like they were going to do on LA Woman. <br />That The Spy isn't a leftover may be proven by the version of Queen Of The Highway on the Essential Rarities cd. There you can hear a jazzy version that's very similar to The Spy. But that a lot of songs are difficult to track down to there exact period of making is obvious. Just listen to the early verions from 1965 of Hello, I Love You (from the third album Waiting For The Sun) and Moonlight Drive (from the second album Strange Days) and hear what I mean. Both songs are made before even the first Doors-album came out.  <br />What am I trying to say here? Just that the songs of the first three albums haven't been made in the order of succesion of the albums. I find the chronological order of songs by some other bands to find out. <br />I'm not saying that it's strange that a band has a lot of stuff before the world gets to know them. Maybe it would be a good idea for new bands to work on their repertoire and get some more live-experience before they get an exclusive record deal. It's just that Morrison Hotel has some songs thatmake me think that maybe the Doors dicided to use some old stuff in the difficult period of their existance after the release of the underestimated Soft Parade. If I'm talking nonsense let me know, if I'm right I'd like to know it too. <br /> <br />Something about the songs: <br />Roadhouse Blues needs no introduction. The state Morrison was in gets very clear in the words `I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer'. Great song to use live and another Doors-bluessong. (Every album's got some blues on it, even the Soft Parade.)  <br />Waiting For The Sun is one of the best songs of the Doors. The song starts to `talk' of very normal human behaviour put into poetic words that make the sun a reminder of the garden of Eden.  <br />`At first flash of Eden, we race down to the sea' <br />and <br />`Can you feel it, now the spring has come <br />that it's time to live in the scattered sun' <br />Maybe this is a poetic beachsong? Well, by the way it is sung we already knew beauty can't last for long: <br />`...waiting for you to tell me what went wrong' <br />And in conclusion:  <br />`This is the strangest life I've ever known' <br />Are we waiting for a sun that will never come up?  <br /> <br />Peace Frog starts with the great funky riff of Krieger. But don't get to happie here. Morrison's still alive (no time for jokes yet like on Other Voices). He sings: <br />`blood in the streets, it's up to my ancles'. Not a pretty scene. Very famous are the words `Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding...' etc. There in this song too. <br /> <br />Great other songs (among the rest) are: The Spy (the easy listening Doorsjazz with the nice metafore of the spy in the house of love), Queen Of The Highway (wich is played very good, the band is tight, and the lyrics are interesting enough when you think about it:  `No one could save her, save the blind tiger, He was a monster, black dressed in leather, She was a princess, Queen of the highway, hope it can continue a little whilelonger') and Maggie McGill (also played very good, Morrison calls himself a bluesman, and sets the tone for the last album of the 4 Doors). <br />
B0009I7NNA|1.0|these guys suck.  The guitarist is way overrated and so is every one else in the band.  The guy has a winny voice is is really annoying.  I dont know how they got so popular but that bat country song is so gay and so is the music video.  People are getting confused that this is punk rock well its not.  BUrn it down is an ok sond but the voice is still really anoying.  I suggest for punkers to get Rancid 2000 album and sex pistols dead kennedys rammones and epecialy the clash instead of this overrated screemo band.

0140544518|5.0|The True Story of the Three Little Pigs allows readers to think about the classic tale from a different perspective- the wolf's. The wolf explains how the whole story started with his search to find a cup of sugar for his grandmother's birthday cake. After having terrible sneezing attacks, the wolf accidently blows the first two pigs' houses down. After the third house, the wolf makes a big scene and gets put into jail. The papers leave out all of the nice information about the wolf and elaborate on the crimes he committed.  <br /> <br />I love this book because it shows how the media can twist stories around to make them more exciting for the readers. It shows both children and adults how not everything they see or hear about in the news is true. I think this message is especially important in the media-driven society that we live in today. I enjoy this book and recommend it to others.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Leave it to the Material Girl to resurrect the glory days of disco.  As a huge fan of `70s music, this collection of a dozen dance songs brings back many happy memories, and though disco may not be here to stay, this updated tribute will have you doing the hustle and bus stop for quite a while.<br /><br />Disco has been popping up here and there, one of the more recent attempts being \\"Murder on the Dancefloor\\" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, but Madonna gives it a new and freshly minted sound.<br /><br />First single \\"Hung Up\\" is one of the most likeable songs in recent history, with its authentic Abba sample and driving beat.  The other outstanding track is the \\"Popcorn\\"-based \\"Jump\\".<br /><br />Other good tracks are \\"Get Together\\", the beginning bars sounding vaguely like Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\"; \\"Sorry\\" and \\"How High\\", which are dance floor magnets, and \\"Like It or Not\\" with its slightly slower tempo.<br /><br />\\"I Love New York\\" is not a great track lyrically, despite the obvious sentiment, but I guess you could call it a \\"confession\\".<br /><br />\\"I don't like cities<br /><br />But I like New York<br /><br />Other places make me feel like a dork<br /><br />Los Angels is for people who sleep<br /><br />Paris and London, baby you can't keep\\"<br /><br />A clever mix of disco-fied R&B, Pop, Euro and trance beats, \\"Confessions\\" is one of her better albums (though certainly not the best) and a must buy for any Madonna fan or party animal of the `70s and `80s.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 15, 2005
0553801503|3.0|The breathlessly awaited fourth installment in Martin's brilliant saga has finally been published here in the U.S.  Many of his faithful readers, including yours truly, have been waiting literally for years to sink their mental teeth into this feast.  When my own copy -- pre-ordered nearly a year ago --came in the mail, I tore into it with more excitement than any book I have read in years.  Of course, with these kind of expectations, some degree of letdown was almost certain.  However, high hopes aside, it cannot be reasonably argued that this novel was up to the standards set by the previous three. <br /> <br />  Some on this site and others may argue that this is a \\"set-up\\" novel, whatever that means -- as if a professional author should truly need over 700 pages to set up a plot that has been ongoing now for three books.  Besides, most hear this logic and are unfortunately reminded of another fantasy author who notoriously lost his way at approximately this same point in his saga, and was defended almost religiously by his fan-base in the same manner.  Others, in a more reasonable argument, point to the slower pace of this installment as compared to the previous three and explain it as a natural progression of events in a post-war world.  Indeed, it seems understandable that the Seven Kingdoms would take a deep breath and regroup after what has been years of nearly non-stop bloodshed and brutality. <br /> <br />  However, these points aside, this reader feels that the most problematic aspect of Martin's newest work is its nearly overwhelming sense of pointlessness.  By this I don't mean that there is no plot.  Essentially, the plot is the same it has been since the first book.  Nor that there is no significant progression of the plot.  After all, several characters go on personal quests, moving throughout Westeros and its neighboring kingdoms and meeting various hardships and attempting to overcome them.  There is even action of a sort, though it is in a muchmore muted and personal fashion than we have previously seen. <br /> <br />  No, the pointlessness I speak of is one that is much more troubling.  It is the same philosophy that permeates most of our American cinema, our music, and practically all of our modern literature: nihilism.  The sense that, overall, nothing really much matters.  Whether you attempt to do good, or evil, or whether you are simply \\"out for yourself\\" in a sort of ethical looting orgy, it is all ultimately futile.  It is something of a cliche to state that \\"no good deed goes unpunished\\", but that is usually meant at least partially tongue in cheek.  In Martin's universe, it is not black humour, but seemingly cosmic law. <br /> <br />  To an extent this is a refreshing change of pace from the usual black and white, us vs. them mentality found in a great deal of fantasy novels.  It is tedious and familiar to instantly ascertain the hero, the villain, and who will eventually triumph within the first twenty pages.  On the other hand, and here Martin most notably is at fault, it is similarly tedious to know that almost as soon as a given character attempts an act of selflessness, or deals with someone honorably, or simply abstains from kicking someone while they are down, they will eventually be repaid with failure. <br /> <br />  And what spectacular, sadistic failures!  Martin is not content to simply allow his noble characters to fail at their goals.  They are humiliated, tortured, stripped of their honor and dignity, horribly mutilated, and finally killed off in particularly brutal fashions.  Without any spoilers, suffice it to say that Martin outdoes himself in this novel with a character actually being eaten WHILE STILL ALIVE.  Outstanding.  What an excellent way to repay the reader who has invested hours of their life following a character through several books. <br /> <br />  One is finally forced to ask the question: why should Martin expect us to invest any emotions into these characters atall?  For that matter, why does the author?  Why write about someone over the course of their lives, describing their trials and tribulations, their hopes and dreams, depicting them fighting overwhelming odds and hardships with honor and courage, only to kill them off in as ignoble and senseless a fashion as can be imagined?  I fail to see what possible purpose this serves, other than to feed the fires of an already incredibly fatalistic public mind. <br /> <br />  In the end, this is Martin's masterpiece and it is completely up to him as to how he dispenses it.  However, I for one am saddened that one of the last bastions of American culture fighting against a nearly overwhelming sense of nihilism -- the fantasy genre -- has seemingly fallen at last.  Perhaps Martin was not the one who stabbed it in the heart, but here he at least twists the blade.  Do we even care enough to mourn?
B000BI0WOA|5.0|There have been a number of Dire Straits \\"best of\\" compilations, including the decent \\"Sultans of Swing\\" 1998 compilation, but this is the first time that the entire career of Mark Knopfler, both in Dire Straits and as a solo artist, is reviewed. I must admit upfront that I am not a great fan of his solo work.<br /><br />\\"Private Investigations: The Very Best of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler\\" (2 CDs; 139 min.) brings 14 Dire Straits songs, 7 Knopfler solo songs, and 1 new Knopfler-Emmylou Harris duet \\"All the Roadrunning\\". The big thing is that the Dire Straits songs are presented in original album-length format. Yes, the full 14+ min. of \\"Telegraph Road, the full 8+ min. of \\"Tunnel of Love\\", etc.Also, no live versions of certain songs are found here (unlike on the \\"Sultans of Swing\\" compilation). Really only 2 (semi)classics are missing: \\"Twisting by the Pool\\" and \\"Heavy Fuel\\" (the latter in any event only a second rate carbon copy of \\"Money for Nothing\\"). The 7 Knopfler songs are outstanding. If you don't have the \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Cal\\" mostly instrumental soundtracks, do yourself a favor and buy them. You'll find one song of each on here. \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\", \\"What It Is\\" and \\"Boom, Like That\\" are equal to his Dire Stratis-standards. The duet with Emmylou Harris is nice, but not essential.<br /><br />If you distill the very best of Mark Knopfler's 25+ year career down to 140 minutes, it really is amazing how good it all sounds. As it should be, the emphasis is on the Dire Straits hits, but when you pick and choose in his solo output, there are some beautiful tracks there as well. This compilation was released without much fanfare, but I highly recommend it!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Forget politics, forget spirituality, forget the critics - MADONNA just wants to dance and drag us all with her on the dance floor.  With Confessions on a Dance Floor, Madonna takes Electronic Dance to the next level.  Hung Up is pure fun and energy, you can never go wrong with Abba.  The song order of the album really plays like a DJ's nightly playlist.  Standouts include Get Together, Sorry (2nd single release), Forbidden Love (groovalicious beats and exotic vocals).  Best Track: Jump (co-written by brother-in-law, Joe Henry who wrote the catchy Don't Tell Me from the Music album) - more great vocals, perfect build-up and if this song doesn't get to you then you should get your ears checked, Madonna at her best.  The remixes will be out of this world.
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|It is rare for rock artists to record a whole album of Christmas music although they like to record singles or tracks for compilation projects, especially where a worthy cause is involved such as the Special Olympics (A very special Christmas series). Thus, I was surprised to find a Christmas album by Jethro Tull, especially as I thought that they had long since faded into obscurity. In fact, although the seventies were their decade of fame, they have continued performing and recording through the intervening years. I am not especially familiar with Jethro Tull's other music (although this album has aroused my curiosity so I will remedy that situation some day) so I'll review this purely on its merits as a Christmas album.<br /><br />The group's leader, Ian Anderson, has a pleasant if unexceptional baritone voice who plays flute, acoustic guitar, mandolin, piccolo and percussion as well as writing songs for the group. Clearly a man of many talents, it is his flute-playing that is the dominant feature of this album. When this album was recorded, the other members of Jethro Tull were Martin Barre (electric and acoustic guitars), Doane Perry (drums and percussion), Andrew Giddings (keyboards, accordion and keyboards bass) and Jonathan Noyce (bass guitar). Guest musicians were James Duncan (drums and percussion), Dave Pegg (bass guitar and mandolin) and the Sturcz string quartet.<br /><br />Some of the tracks are instrumentals while others feature vocals. As the flute is ideally suited to Christmas music, the results are very enjoyable. There are a few familiar tunes here but they are very distinctive. Quite apart from the sound of the flute, the arrangements are sometimes different from the standard.<br /><br />This album works well as background music when it comes across as a very upbeat album, but if you make the effort to listen to the lyrics, you'll find that they are not always upbeat as there a hint of cynicism. If you enjoy the sound of the flute and you're looking for a Christmas album unlike any other, this is for you.re looking for a Christmas album unlike any other, this is for you.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|What the Reviewers said: <br /> <br />This CD, when originally released, received 4 star ratings from Blender and Vibe magazine. (Other reviewers gave generally favorable reviews).  The re-release contains all of the orginal 14 tracks plus 4 new songs, including Don't Forget About Us.   <br /> <br />What I say: <br /> <br />From people I have talked to, everyone has 5 or 6 favorite songs and they are rarely the same.  This just proves that there is a song for everyone on this CD.  Whether you like Adult contemporary, R&B, or pop, you are guaranteed to find songs you love.  In the End, you are bound to enjoy 3/4 of the record (if not the whole CD). <br /> <br />How has the general public responded? <br /> <br />-3.7 million copies sold in the US (6 million worldwide) <br />-Won awards at the World Music Awards, Teen Choice Awards, 4 awards at the Vibe Awards, and a couple at the Lady Soul Train Awards
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After 2003's horrid \\"American Life\\", Madonna returns to the disco with this CD. It is shockingly good. The genius of the CD is that it takes classic dance sounds from the past (Donna Summer/Giorgio Moroder, Depeche Mode/New Order, Air/Daft Punk, Abba, and even Madonna herself)and updates them. They are reminscient of classic dance songs, but, each has their own, current identity. The CD is best enjoyed as a whole instead of a collection of individual songs: each song segues into the next and there is a remarkable cohesivenes to the project. Somehow it manages to be both upbeat and danceable as well as downtempo and ambient so it can reflect your mood whether you want to dance or to chill the night away. The lyrics are the weakest part, but, when the melody and song execution are this good I can look past dumb and/or cliched words. If you like Ray of Light, or late 70's/early 80's sounds then you will love this album. Hopefully this CD will be commercially successful and signal a turn away from American radio's dependency on tuneless hip hop and the crap that poses as r & b these days. My faves are:  \\"hung up\\", \\"sorry\\", \\"jump\\" and \\"future lovers\\" Highly Recommended!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|For all the self-proclaimed Mariah Carey's fans, chill out and stay away from this new CD by Madonna cause you are just totally incapable of even beginning to understand good dance music. Though I don't dislike Mariah Carey, her music is nothing campared to the brilliance of Madonna. Even comparing them seems so banal! Madonna is an icon and has never been afraid of experimenting with her music because she strives for excellence. Mariah Carey, however, is only good for screeching and making mundane radio-friendly 'americanised hip hop' music which has absolutely no relevance and gravity outside of the United States. I must, however, say that all Mariah is well capable of is showing off her legs and assets to grab a nice spot on the charts no thanks to her racy music videos. But Madge will never degrade herself to such limits, she has better taste no matter what u hate-mongers say.  <br /> <br />As about her new album 'COAD', its absolutely mesmerising. The stand-out tracks are 'Hung Up', 'Get Together', 'Sorry' and 'Jump'. 'Isaac' is probably my favorite track from the album because not only does it sound very different, i love the male background vocals. All in all, a great album worth every penny. Welcome back, Madonna!! <br /> <br />P.S: All those Mariah fans out there who make a life out of trashing Madonna or other better artists, GET A LIFE! please!!
B000BGH22W|5.0|Has anyone complaining about rock in Harry Potter actually read the book?  The Weird Sisters are featured in the book and they play rock, so they captured that in the movie as well.  Not saying you have to like the songs, but the reaction that they don't belong is stupid. <br /> <br />As for the Patrick Doyle score, it is very good, although it sounds like he made a mixture of John Williams' Harry Potter and Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br />John Williams was better, but this is still very good.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|\\"I do yoga and pilates and the room is full of hotties\\" - This little \\"rap\\" was enough to turn the world against Madonna's American Life album and it really isn't a bad album.  Not one of her best but certainly not the disaster most will make it seem.  I think Madonna fans, apparently the only people that bought the album, would agree.  So along comes Confessions On A Dance Floor.  This is a great album featuring a determined Madonna.  Not as \\"new\\" as Ray of Light was upon it's release, it is nonetheless a Madonna we haven't heard for some time.  She seems to have given the more experimental music a break (though Isaac, like Shanti Ashantagi from Ray of Light, has been receiving mixed reviews).  Which to the long time fans is a sort of shame.  Back are the melodies and beats that made her the superstar that she is.  The most refreshing thing about this great disc is that it's the fun Madonna that we've all missed so much.  All of the tracks, some stronger than others, are classic Madonna.  It's familiar and new at the same time.  While some critics and reviews are hailing this as the return of Madonna, the true fans knew she never left.
0553801503|5.0|I was surprised by the number of disappointing reviews for this book.  I think the main problem is that many of the most sympathetic characters are missing (except for Arya and Samwell), but this is still a great book, and it looks like there will be some really exciting developments for these characters in the future. <br /> <br />The plot has definitely slowed down, with the exception of Queen Cersei's character.  She is one of the main characters in this novel-it would be disappointing to have such an unsympathetic character dominate the book if she weren't so vigorously working toward her own downfall.  Watching her destroy herself keeps it interesting.  She creates all kinds of interesting messes that will have to be sorted out in book 6.  Her reinstatement of an  order that sounds a lot like the holy inquisition will probably become a major plotline in future.     <br /> <br />One of the most exciting developments is that it looks like Dorne is going to come in as a major player.  Prince Doran Martel has been doing some long-term plotting for the Targaryens, and maybe this explains who Varys has been working for all this time? <br /> <br />Finally, there is a bit of Arya in this book, which greatly improved it for me.  She doesn't do much, but her parts are still really interesting. <br /> <br />The plot has slowed a bit, but the quality of the writing is so good, that it didn't bother me.  I think it was worth the wait.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|Tim Burton should stay away from remakes!   This is right up there with his disasterous remake of Planet of the Apes.   Both inane and pointless.  The differences between the original movie and the book do not warrant this remake.  Johnny Depp is just creepy (and I usually like his work), and the Oompa Loompa was just plain wrong!  Plus, the attempts to modernize the songs fall flat.  Even the young actor playing Charlie, who was wonderful in Finding Neverland, is dull in this film as he whispers his way through.  Do yourself a favor, rent the original, as I doubt this one will even be remembered in 10 years.
B000002A6Q|5.0|Not that I think that many people will give much attention to the one star reviewer (attention that he/she so desperately craves) - but a couple facts need to be stated. First off, this is supposed to be a forum to review music, not the politics of the artist, isn't it? Second, BTR is a bona fide classic (like you don't already know?) and would remain so even if Bruce *HAD* committed a heinous crime/act, other than disagreeing with a Republican.
B000AV2G3I|3.0|There's not too many ways to repackage John Lennon's solo work.  With only 8 albums and a handful of stand-alone singles, it's not a hefty investment to buy his whole solo output.  Unlike Paul's work of the same period, John's solo albums are unified in both substance and style.  Each one is a singular statement that shouldn't be broken up into singles and radio favorites.  Almost all of his solo albums have been remastered now and have far greater value to his legacy than a \\"hits\\" or \\"best of\\" package (historically speaking he didn't have many \\"hits\\" in his lifetime; and a \\"best of\\" collection is wholly subjective.)  I'm still waiting for the remastered \\"Walls and Bridges\\" album to complete my collection (which I found out is being released November 22!)
0895260131|5.0|WOW all i have to say is WOW. If anyone is compelled by the synopsis of this book, then i fear that naural selection has not been successful, and that darwin's theory's have been proven wrong. For those who have no understanding of what i mean, it's this, natural selection dictates that the fittest and smartest survive, those who have given this book a positive review fit into the do not represent the above stated theory. In laymens terms you aren't the sharpest tools in the sheds.  <br /> <br />Next thing to say is this, CONTEXT, has anybody ever heard of context. One cannot simply extract verses or terms without understanding the contexts. \\"Islam is evil because this verse said it was.\\" Wow that's like aying 2+2 IS 5. You cannot exclude the context from a quotation. Otherwise this entire amazon website would be filled with out of context verses from the bible and torah.

B000094HMU|5.0|Deutsche Grammophne produces first-class opera and classical music on recording and DVD and this 1988 performance of Turandot from the Met is visually the best. It stars Eva Marton in the title role, Placido Domingo as Prince Calaf, Leona Mitchell as Liu and Paul Plishka as the Tartar King. It is thanks to Italian film director Franco Zefferelli that this Turandot has gained special notoriety. The afterparty was rumored to have been a grand affair in itself, and the press photos were in the cover of Opera News. Guests at the party included Elizabeth Taylor who attended the premiere. This is exactly the type of grand opera that fits Zefferelli's taste for the grandiose, lush color, scenic backdrops, huge crowd scenes and lavish design. The costumes are particularly striking. Eva Marton looks and sings the part with virtuosic aplomb, though she does not convey too much characterization when compared to such celebrated Turandots as Eva Turner, Ghena Dimitrova and most notably Birgit Nilsson. Still, Turandot is wonderful as the man-hating, icy Princess of Peking. Placido Domingo was born to play Calaf, for he acts the part with aplomb. He sings wonderfully, with a voice that perfectly captures heroism and Puccini's vision of this determined prince. Domingo was criticized for taking on such a difficult part (in truth it is Puccini's most difficult tenor part) but it is a performance that is yet to be surpassed. His \\"Nessun Dorma\\" is far more moving and emotinally direct than the showy, meaningless manner that Pavarotti sang it. Domingo is the real reason I bought this DVD. It's sad that he was paired with weaker singers. If Eva Marton does not potray a dramatically moving Turandot (who goes from goddess to mortal woman in love in the course of only a few hours) Leona Mitchell fails visibly as the slave girl Liu. Leona has the right voice, sweetened but full-lyric, but she is a large woman who cannot possibly understand what it is like to be a frail, lovesick slave who isdriven to suicide. I prefer smaller Lius (like those of Renata Scotto and Cecilia Gazdia). This is a dream of a Turandot however and looks stunning. We are whisked away to another time and place. It is a mythic China, a Shangri-La where a princesss under a dark spell is saved by a Prince. Enjoy!
B000BB1MHS|1.0|My children were scared out of their wits by Johnny Depp in this movie.  They had seen \\"Willy Wonka\\" from 1971 and enjoyed it thoroughly so I took them to see this and I so regretted it.  Their nightmares began soon enough.  They could see Charlie (Depp) chasing them threatning to dip them in chocolate!  This is definitely NOT a movie I would recommend young children to see.  As an adult, I was extremely disappointed.  Hollywood fails again in its attempt to top a classic.
0440178002|5.0|James Clavell's 70's novel Shogun is a long but enjoyable read. Set in the most defining moment of Japanese history- the time of its European conquest/exploration- it tells the story of Captain Blackthrone, who transforms himself from a bigoted Brit to a man who fully appreciates a foreign culture. The book is full of intrigue, adventure and romance. The historical details were well-researched and full of shocking authenticity. During this period of conflict between the Japanese and Americans/Europeans, many atrocities were committed on both sides. The characters are plentiful -Lord Toranaga,  Lady Ochiba, Father Alvito, Lady Toda, Lord Ishido, Lady Sazuko, Lord Yabu, Lord Kiyama, Council of Regents, Lord General, Jan Roper, Kasigi Yabu, Toda Mariko, Lord Jesus, Lord Zataki, Lord Hiro-matsu, Lord Sudara, Father Sebastio, Lord God, and Lady Kiri. The principal characters develop and change throughout the novel. They are characters whom we care about, particularly Blackthorne, Lady Kiri, Father Alvito, Lord Yabu and Lord Kiyama in my personal opinion. The descriptions of kimonos, teahouses, samurai weaponry, ships, temples and castles are all very vivid. This is probably the greatest historical novel about ancient Japan ever made. It is first of all a work of fiction so don't expect 100 percent historical accuracy. But for aspiring writers of historical fiction, this is a fine study specimen. Clavell has a strong talent for this type of fiction as his other historic works attest. The detail, the precision, the imagery, it is Clavell's most famous work. It is his magnum opus. It must have takne years for him to write this and even if he had written nothing else, this novel would have secured his success. In the earl 80's it was made into an equally impressive film.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Are you a long-time Madonna fan or someone who's curious and wants to be initiated? Read on... <br /> <br />I became a big Madonna fan when she released her Ray of Light album in 1998, considered her comeback album. Then in 2003, she released her anti-war album American Life. The CD wasn't bad - nor her best - but she got majorly trashed and as a result went through the biggest critical backlash of her career. <br /> <br />But Madonna is known to work harder when she's down and here, with Confessions on a Dancefloor, she releases her BEST album in years. <br /> <br />It's dance - her roots - but with an intelligent message. The songs segue into each other.  <br /> <br />You probably her Hung Up, the ABBA-sampling WHOPPER of a song. I dare you to put this CD on and not dance and not listen to it non-stop. <br /> <br />It is perfect to listen to start your morning routine, to work out with in the gym, to blast in your car, to blast when you get home, or to blast at work to help you focus and get in the creative and energetic mood. <br /> <br />Madonna has done it. She's produced her best album EVER. I am so happy to be a Madonna fan and it was totally worth the awful backlash period she went through.  <br /> <br />For those who want to know what the fuss about Madonna is - buy this album. Be warned though: You will NEVER LOOK BACK.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Like it or not, you can not deny this album as being a really really great dance album, through and through.  I haven't heard Madonna having so much fun since Ray Of Light.  Music and American Life were great in there own right, but, were too experimental.  This is a glorious return to what Madonna knows best... how to make us dance, how to make us feel excited and happy.  Every song on this album is utterly infectious and will have you humming along, if not singing along to every word!  Even the 'dorky' track \\"I Love New York\\".  I really didn't like this song at first, but even it has grown on me.  That aside, the rest of the album is top notch.  I give every track on the album a 10/10, and it's very rare that I do that.  I'm really happy to know that there are still some artist out there making great music.
B00013RC8O|4.0|\\"Vanishing Point\\" is definitely a byproduct of it's time.  Made in the wake of the success of \\"Easy Rider\\" it plays like a counter-culture episode of \\"The Dukes of Hazzard\\".  The film is colorfully entertaining and the car chases are cool enough but what does it all mean?  Why does Kowalski(Barry Newman) have to transport the Dodge Challenger from Denver to Frisco at risk to life and limb not the least ticking off the law enforcement who get in his way?  Could it be because of the physical and psychic scars he's carrying?  Is the public that starved for heroics that they choose an outlaw like Kowalski?  Oh, well, it's 1971(practically the sixties).  Enjoy the ride.
0553801503|4.0|Martin has finally come out with his much awaited installment five years after the last. Perhaps this is why the book didn't live up to my expectations so much, because I was craving Martin too much. <br /> <br />This his fourth book is a decent and much needed addition to his Song of Ice and Fire series. This book is mostly in a holding pattern, moving sideways and furthering the development of the series. At first this was disappointing as nothing was happening, and nothing really major did happen until around page 430. After that the book improved as some inroads were made into what the characters were thinking, what motivated them. <br /> <br />His writing is excellent, so no fault there. What is especially good about Martin is that he knows how to write a story and keep its mystery alive, leaving you wondering what will happen next. In the past it was through Bran being pushed out the window, Jaime losing his hand, Robb being betrayed, Tyrion killing his father, Catelyn Stark dying and becoming reborn. It is those elements of shock that attract readers to Martin, and he certainly has some elements of shock within this book. <br /> <br />Although I am a little disappointed in how slow _A Feast for Crows_ (and really, the crows didn't feast much) advances the plot, I am very pleased at how the book ended and what happened in between. There are some chapters that don't add much to the book itself (such as Brienne and Arya's chapters), but do much to the sloryline of the series as a whole.  Martin was still able to captivate me through and through, which is a great achievement despite the slow read. Give this one a go, but don't expect much. Instead, prepare to be immersed in the world of court intrigue as the story is strengthened and the foundation is being laid for the future of A Song of Ice and Fire. <br />
B000BGH22W|1.0|I had the chance of hearing the soundtrack a couple of days before its release, I must say when the \\"Rock\\" came on I nearly died laughing. In my mind I could see John Williams shaking his head and pointing at Doyle. The original Williams scores were great and did a lot for the film, these are utter retarded nonsense. But you know, I wan't to know why John isn't doing the films score??? I mean it can;t be money! The CD has like 10 people listed, their paycheck couldn't have been smaller than williams. Oh Well, all good empires die, I guess Harry is going down, and music was the first scapegoat.HA HA HA HA!
B000BYY0RY|5.0|Kylie shed the cool (almost distant) image she took on during her Body Language period just in time for her long awaited Greatest Hits tour; aptly named \\"Showgirl.\\"  Almost every major hit from the past 20 years show up in either full song or medley form.  The tracklist is as follows: <br /> <br />'Better The Devil You Know' <br />'In Your Eyes' <br />'Giving You Up' <br />'On A Night Like This' <br />'Shocked/What Do I Have To Do/Spinning Around' <br />'In Denial' <br />'Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi' <br />'Confide In Me' <br />'Red Blooded Woman / Where The Wild Roses Grow' <br />'Slow' <br />'Please Stay' <br />'Over The Rainbow' <br />'Come Into My World' <br />'Chocolate' <br />'I Believe In You' <br />'Dreams' <br />'Hand On Your Heart' <br />'The Locomotion'  <br />'I Should Be So Lucky' <br />'Your Disco Needs You' <br />'Put Yourself In My Place' <br />'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' <br />'Especially For You' <br />'Love at First Sight' <br /> <br />And get this, she sings the whole thing LIVE.  No prerecorded vocals here!  A certain Queen of pop could learn a thing or two from Kylie when it comes to singing live. <br /> <br />The highlight of the evening has to be the updated Follies version of Hand On Your Heart.  It's just perfection!  The way Kylie and her dancers move is so prissy and girly, it's great!  Another highlight has to be Put Yourself In My Place.  The backing track for the original song has been mixed with the Star Wars and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind theme songs, adding to the illusion that Kylie is some alien queen seducing mankind with her music. <br /> <br />So, if you want an extravaganza of song, dance (yes, she dances now.  And rather well, too!), and amazing theatrics, this is the DVD for you. <br /> <br />Well done Kylie! A+ <br /> <br />P.S. Kylie is currently undergoing chemotherepy after finding out she has breast cancer last year.  This ulimately led to the postponement of the tour.
0140177396|5.0|When asked I tell people OF MICE AND MEN is my favorite book.<br /><br />My youngest son had to read it for ninth grade English class and was exclaiming over it. I have read it numerous times but not for many years. I bought a copy and read it again. It is always good. The dark themes remind me that the misfits of the world have a place but too often it is a place with tragic consequences that effect us all and always will.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is quite possibly the best album to ever grace this universe with its presence and originality.  No other album has been able to withstand the test of time with the amount of popularity as does The Wall.  The Wall has become a household product of those appreciative of great music and the enduring spirit of humanity. With political overtones unmatched by even \\"U2\\" It will continue to remain popular until the ideas of oppression of the human race exist on this diminishing planet.  Since this planetary race is doomed to excrement I vow to always listen to the Soundtrack, THE WALL!  May the hopeful prove me wrong!    2005
0446691437|5.0|This book just made me laugh in recognition. No hand holding here, just plain truth and a good swift kick. An excellent read!<br /><br />When doing the laundry feels more urgent than working, you know you're dealing with resistance. We've all been there and you'll see yourself repeatedly in this book of entertaining and insightful essays.<br /><br />You will be inspired to take your work seriously, move beyond your resistance, and become prolifically creative.<br /><br />On my \\"buy it, get it from the library or skip it\\" scale, this is a definite buy.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|AC/DC, the greatest rock and roll band in the world debuted in the States in 1976. This record is actually a little bit of their first two Australian releases HIGH VOLTAGE(1) and TNT. Though it is possible to get the imported versions of both (which include a lot of tracks unavailable in this country) this package is still a VERY AWESOME album.<br /><br />THis is back to the very basics AC/DC. Those of you only familiar with BACK IN BLACK should pick up this album to experience what AC/DC was originally about.... A couple dirty school boys, a few sadistic musicians, and a drunken diddler pervert type lead vocalist known as BON. Together they created free spirited rock thunder that shattered the rules around the world. THIS ALBUM IS VERY INTENSE, one of the must owns for sure! The only two songs that are close to sub-par are ROCK AND ROLL SINGER and SHES GOT BALLS...., those ones rock the least HARD.... that means they still rule! LONG WAY TO THE TOP is an instant classic. I don't now how you can't be movin' when this piece kicks in, LIVE WIRE is another intense bit; killer lyrics too (something that MAY lack in later years- there ARE many clever lines on this whole disc!) LITTLE LOVER is one of the funniest, dirtiest tunes they ever did, sans THE JACK, a nice bluesy bit that you can interpret anyway you like (its really about the clapp, but I like the idea of a lady playing cards..)<br /><br />TNT is a HUGE song. EARLY punk type track that RIPS,,this song is legendary....  CAN I SIT NEXT TO YOU is another hard paced rocker.<br /><br />This whole album is the stuff that Rock and Roll is made of. This is for care free destruction, and self deprication. If you need a lesson in hard edged, free spirited RAWKIN you better get yourself signed up for these classes NOW!
B000000WA4|5.0|Most bad reviews the Pumpkins get is a direct attack on Billy Corgan.I think is funny how people think they \\"know\\" some guy from a rock band just because they heard his music and read his interviews.\\"Look at Eddie Veder...wonderful person,I can tell\\" \\"Now,Billy Corgan is a pretencious prick\\". Grow up ladies.These are not the backsreet boys... <br /> <br />I love every single track on this album.It's a masterpiece that could only come out of a pretencious prick head.Want Ordinary? Go listen to your old boring grunge album...or maybe go buy the new Puddle of Mud album.
0684824906|5.0|Having written my thesis on Abraham Lincoln's philosophies, I found this book to be an extraordinary breath of fresh air.  Ms. Goodwin is an excellent author who certainly put forth a scholarly effort!
B0000027EP|5.0|This is one of my altime favorite CDs!  At first, it seems that Motorhead goes 1000mph throughout the whole cd, but then, you get to the eery, nightmare that is \\"NIGHTMARE/THE DREAMTIME\\" and \\"LOVE ME FOREVER\\".  These two songs break away from the 1000mph speed limit.  Songs on here, like \\"NO VOICES IN THE SKY\\" and \\"MAKE MY DAY\\", just stay in your head...but believe me...it's a good thing!  And finally, \\"1916\\" comes along and completely breaks away from the genre, but the song itself is still cool. <br /> <br />I was somewhat amazed by the lyrics throughout the cd. <br />They may not make sense sometimes, well most of the time, but hey, they fit the mood perfectly. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this for speed-freaks.
0316666343|5.0|I was told that this book was great by a friend but somehow didn't think such a book would be so, I assumed it was a freakish book made for girls.  However, I read it and loved it.  I loved the way the author described heaven.  I always had a certain thought of the way heaven would be and in this book it seems like the author read my mind and wrote exactly what i was thinking. Although, it's a sad book it gives a sort of comfort to know that our loved ones as they pass are in a truly better place. I think this book is great for either male or female readers.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Let's be honest. DM is like pizza - it's even good cold and its hard to find a bad piece. This is a good album, plain and simple. No deep analysis required and much better than most of the garbage that plays on MTV or the radio or XMRADIO or anything that mimics the mundane top 40 garbage that sounds as if it was written in 3 minutes. (Ok, MTV doesn't play videos anymore). <br />Anyway, I enjoy listening to this to and from work. It has a great beat and you can dance to it.  <br />Enough with the silliness. Enjoy the lack of silence and just buy it. DM fans will not be disappointed. <br />  <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|MADONNA is back with her new album Confessions on a Dance Floor and it is an amazing album and one of her best!<br /><br />HUNG UP - This is the first single off of the new album and is a huge hit in the clubs. The song has a sample from ABBA's song Gimme Gimme Gimme (which I have never heard) and has MADONNA singing about someone she is hung up on. The song has a very great groove and it's definitely the most commercial song on the album. With the chorus line \\"Every little thing that you say or do I'm HUNG UP, I'm hung up on you.\\" and lines like \\"Ring , ring, ring goes the telephone, the lights are on but there's no one home\\" the song gets stuck in your mind and you find yourself singing these catchy lines. No Madonna song has as catchy lines since \\"INTO THE GROOVE\\" which had Madonna sing \\"At night I lock the doors and no one else can see\\". Very strong single that will keep the dance club crowd on there feet.<br /><br />GET TOGETHER - This is a great up- beat song (inspired by Stardust - Music Sounds Better With You) with a very laid back trance like feel to it. The song has Madonna singing to a person she really likes asking \\"Do you believe in love at first sight?\\" Even if it's an illusion she states she don't care. \\"Can we get Together? I really, I really want to be with you. Come on check it out with me, I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too.\\" Put some head-phones on and close your eyes and the Great retro dance beat along with the trance feel take you to another world.<br /><br />SORRY - This is rumored to be one of the new singles from the album. Madonna sings \\"I don't want to hear, I don't want to know please don't say your SORRY.\\" to someone she is probably never going to forgive. The songs chorus sounds similar to the bass line from The Jackson's' 1981 hit Can You Feel. Sure to be another huge club and commercial hit.<br /><br />FUTURE LOVERS - This is one of my favorite songs on the album. This song also has a retro vibe to it with another trance like feel. This song has a lot of stuff going on musically and it is inspired by Giorgio Moroder/I feel Love by Donna Summer. The song has some spoken vocals for the first minute and a half, then it breaks out in to this awesome dance song. She sings \\"In the evidence of it's brilliance\\" talking about love. This song is going to be HUGE in the clubs.<br /><br />I LOVE NEW YORK - Great dance song that has MADONNA telling us how much she loves NEW YORK and hinting towards George Bush and his home state. Singing, \\"If you don't like my attitude then you can just f off. Just go to Texas, isn't that where they golf.\\" Very awesome dance song with a very punk rock feel to it. This is also rumored to be a single off of the new album.<br /><br />LET IT WILL BE - this is a song that has a raw feel to it with a funky house groove and a retro 80's feel to it. This song sounds similar to the string opening (played on a synth) from her own song PAPA DON'T PREACH. This song has MADONNA singing lines like \\"Now I can tell you about success, about fame, about the rise and the fall, of all the stars in the sky, Don't it make you smile? Let it will Be. Just let it be. Won't you let it be?\\"<br /><br />FORBIDDEN LOVE - This is one of the slowest dance songs on the album and one of the most beautiful. The song has computer generated, and vocoder style vocals and has another 80's feel to it. The song is the closest thing to a ballad on the album. MADONNA sings \\"Once upon a time there was a boy and there was a girl. Hearts that intertwined they lived in a different kind of world. Forbidden Love are we supposed to be together? Forbidden Love we seal are destiny forever.\\"<br /><br />JUMP - This is one of my other favorite tracks on this album. This song has a great beat and classic MADONNA vocals. This is one song that will make the club crowd JUMP and remind anyone of classic MADONNA. Madonna sings \\" We learned our lesson from the start my sisters and me. The only thing you can depend on is yourfamily. Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree. It sways, and it swings and it bends until it makes you see. Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump. Don't ever look back oh baby. Yes I'm ready to jump. Just take my hand, get ready to... are you ready?\\" This would be a great single and in some countries is expected to be released as a single.<br /><br />HOW HIGH - This song has a great beat to it and is another song that has computer generated, and vocoder style vocals. This is a song that has lyrics (similar to \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love) about Madonna analyzing and evaluating her fame and success. She sings \\"How HIGH are the stakes? How much fortune can you make? Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone?\\" Another great song!<br /><br />ISAAC - This is another beautiful song on the album. Despite the early controversy this song has spawned, this is s song that has a very beautiful Jewish chant with strings and guitars that envelope you and take you on an emotional journey. This has some of the most beautiful lyrics MADONNA has ever wrote. She sings \\"Wrestle with your darkness. Angels call your name. Can you hear what they are saying? Will You ever be the same?\\" People may not like this song because of the spiritual vibe, the Jewish chant, and because it is different, since some people don't like things that are different. I love this song!<br /><br />PUSH ME - This is a great inspirational song that she probably wrote for her husband Guy. Very Uplifting beat that some people say samples a slowed down section from her own hit \\"LIKE A PRAYER.\\" Madonna sings \\"You PUSH ME to go the extra mile. You push me when it's difficult to smile. You push me a better version of myself. You push me only you and no one else. You push me see the other pont of view. You push me when there's nothing else to do. You push me when I think I know it all. You push me when I stumble and I fall.\\" This is a great song that reminds us all how much our lovers/partners love us and push us to be better.<br /><br />LIKE IT OR NOT - This is another great song influenced by her own cover of her hit FEVER. This is for all those people who for what ever reason don't like MADONNA and always put her down. She once again analyzes herself and says, like it or not this is who I am. She sings: \\"You can call me a sinner, you can call me a saint. This is who I am, You can like it or not, You can love me or leave me, But I'm never going to stop.\\" Awesome song and some great advice from a strong women who just keeps going on her journey no matter what people think of her. Cleverly this last song closes this beautiful future-disco album with an acoustic guitar.<br /><br />I have to say it's very sad to see some of these reviewers post reviews about how much they hate Madonna or like other artists better. The reviews they write have nothing to do with Madonna's new album and yet they give her 1 star all because they don't like her. After reading the reviews I can tell most of them have not even heard the album because the reviews they wrote are so far from what the songs are about. I guess MADONNA is still a huge threat to them and they have to post such hateful things about someone they don't like all because she is MADONNA. In a MADONNA like fashion I will not get bitter toward them, I will forgive them and ask that God Blesses each and every one of them.<br /><br />And should any of you good people out there be the target like MADONNA and find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness, ignorance, smallness or insecurities; Remember, things could be worse. You could be one of them!<br /><br />MADONNA once again leads while the rest will follow. This is the best MADONNA album since RAY of Light!family. Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree. It sways, and it swings and it bends until it makes you see. Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump. Don't ever look back oh baby.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album kinda sounds like what would happen if The Pixies and Talking Heads took a huge crap. But what a beautiful, hypnotic piece of crap it is!!! Each song captivates you in a a magical way, transporting you to a catchy, spooky universe where music is organically born. Do Purchase.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|This cd is a splendid collection of some of their greatest songs.  I would have included Don't Ask Me Why, but why quibble? The new songs are good- especially I've Got a Life- which includes an enthralling, strong vocal from Annie.  The singles sound great- all remastered with love & care.  Buy this collection- you won't be sorry.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Nobody can go wrong with ABBA, as we all know HUNG UP, the melody that is catching and hooking us on Madonna's opening song is actually is ABBA's song!  <br /> <br />I listened to the whole album and I would give it 2 1/2 out of 5 stars!  <br /> <br />Non-stop dance music, all tracks are mixed in togeher. I am not a fan of Madonna's earlier work. I like her now....better.  <br /> <br />1. Hung Up = ABBA good!~ Listen to \\"Gimme Gimme (A man after midnigh)t\\" you will LOVE IT  <br /> <br />2. Get Together - I love the way this song starts, with a bunch of alarm clocks going off! DANCE HOT!  <br /> <br />3. Sorry - Stuck on my mind ...although..\\"I've heard it all before...I;ve heard it all before...\\"  <br /> <br />4. Future Lovers - classic Madonna, sounds like Erotica track!  <br /> <br />5. I Love New York --nice song but not very nice towards people in other cities...and countries...F...Off.. she says to those who does not like her attitude:) ok...I got it! It not a political statement, right?  Ok, I thought so...Texas... Bush... <br /> <br />6. Let It Will Be ...ok music, but more of a filler...song.../ or as Madonna would say - her confession on her dance floor!  <br /> <br />7. Forbidden Love - I like this one a lot...a married Madonna missing her past relationships??? Just one kiss...once upon a time there was a boy and a girl....just one touch...oh man!  <br />Are we're supposed to be together?! I think it could be a very great CLUB track!  <br /> <br />8. Jump - OK...Are you ready to jump? Nothing special...  <br /> <br />9. How High - this track is ok for its \\"robotic\\" Madonna voice...how high are the stakes...another small confession she is making...reminds me of a bunch of robots marching!  <br /> <br />10. Isaac - no comments....all I can say this song does not belong to the album!  <br /> <br />11. Push - My other favourite! We all need somebody to push us! Although I would never think that Madonna needs somebody to push her, she is very self sufficient and strong willed person, but I guess, her hubby , like nobody can PUSH HER! PUSH ME BABY!  <br /> <br />12. Like It Or Not - I think she could find a better ending for a confession , not to mention we are on a dance floor, right? But, hey! This is MAdoNna StyLe....Like it or not...she always has something to say.  <br /> <br />I think her best work was \\"Ray of Light\\"....period.  <br />
B0002SROT0|4.0|The fact that this album was released a year or so after Smith's death makes each song on From A Basement On The Hill all the more intensely poignant. To be brutally frank, the tracks on this album have far greater effect than any of his previously released ones because he proved that he wasn't overreacting or overdramatising his heartache or existential woes - they were real. If anyone else had written the line, \\"I can't prepare for death anymore than I already have\\" (King's Crossing) you'd just label it as angst. That it's so openly confessed in this album makes it one of the most confronting lines ever written. But this album is not consistently what you'd expect from a man on the verge of suicide. It also features some of his most uplifting work like Pretty (Ugly Before). Sometimes the emotional intensity of From A Basement On The Hill is a lot to take, but it is a beautiful album with Smith's delicacy and rawness displayed to full effect.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I can't put this record down!  I LOVE IT, I have listened to it about a hundred times already.  I have been a fan since her first album and I have appreciated all of her music, there isn't an album that I don't like.  Like all creative artists, Madonna is creative, and changes.  If she didn't....we would all be bored!  Thank you Madonna!!! for entertaining us and giving us the gift of great music to move are bodies and our minds too!
B000BB1MI2|5.0|It's just different enough from the original movie, you can really enjoy it. I loved the first movie and was almost afraid to get it, but my Grand-daughter whose 4 just had to see it. She's now seen it about 10 times since I bought the movie, wants to see it everyday soon as her mom drops her off, and I've enjoyed seeing it almost as often. My grandson is only 2 and he loves it as well. At first they were kind of nervous about the dolls burning but then they saw them going to the doll hospital and it was ok. We have a doll hospital here, for dolls that have been colored on or had bad hair cuts. lol Plus, of course I let them know as you have to let children know these things are  pretend, just a movie. People can do anything they want with their imagination. I personally thought it was great, when at the end of the doll burning you see Depp standing there clapping like a madman and the look everyone gave him, priceless. Then of course the look my grandchildren gave me seeing me laughing so hard. I laughed till I cried. Just don't watch it expecting an exact replica of the original and you'll be fine. It was a great movie I'm sure our whole family will enjoy for years to come if they don't wear it out watching it everyday first ;-) <br /> <br />Favorite line from the movie: The best kind of prize is a Surprize....talk about demented and you have to see the face he makes when he says that makes me laugh just typing it. lol I don't think I have laughed this hard at a movie or as often in years!
B000AL730O|5.0|Once again Sir Paul McCartney brings us his best.  You could never go wrong with a McCartney \\"album\\" and the same is true with this one.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is the Madonna album I've always wanted Madonna to make. Don't get me wrong, I love all her albums. She is the queen of pop. She has made some of the best music of the last 20 years. So hear me out when I say - this is something really special. Her best album? It's very possible. <br /> <br />Each track is single worthy. Each track makes you want to dance and sing (get up and do your thing). All of it runs together like a DJ set and the beats are futuristic while still referencing the past when dance music was at its peak. The highlights for me are Get Together, Sorry, Isaac, Push, Jump, and Future Lovers. But I love them all. Congratulations Madonna. You have returned with glorious form.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|It doesnt really matter what people say about Madonna, she does what wants to anyway. Or did in the 1980s. Madonna stopped being an innovator in 1994 when she chased trends to craft the RnB heavy \\"bedtime Stories\\" with trendy producers BabyFace and Dallas Austin. The same has happened again as the \\"american Life\\" album tanked and has Madonna looking to remain commercially viable with a new \\"dance\\" album. Is it any good? Yes, it is.<br /><br />  Fans of Madonna's 1980's music probably havent followed trends in clubland and may not take to the layered synthesized club sounds and sometimes not so melodic tracks. Much has been made over the sometimes inane lyrics (most notably rhyming \\"new york\\" and \\"Dork\\") but the point isnt to be lyrically deep-its about the beats.<br /><br />  The album samples and borrows heavily from other artists works. This is most apparent on first single \\"hung up\\" which samples ABBA's \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (a man after midnight)\\" an uptempo dance track. Other sounds are worked in also. Pet Shop Boys' \\"West End Girls\\" keyboard can be heard on the fun and europop sounding \\"Jump\\". The baseline to Jackson 5's \\"Can you feel it\\" (already overused on other dance records) crops up on \\"Sorry\\". And Madonna is fair enough to borrow from her own back catalogue using bits of her own melodies. The song \\"Push\\" has some scattering triangle sounds and beats while using the melody from \\"like a prayer\\".<br /><br />Standout tracks for me are \\"Jump\\", \\"Sorry\\", \\"like it or not\\", the eastern sounding \\"Isaac\\" and \\"let it will be\\".<br /><br />The sleeve art is amazing with its vibrant blues, indigos and pinks. Its hard to believe Madonna is in her late 40s. The booklet has great shots and the package really works to sell the music.<br /><br />The album may sound like a total hack job when reviewed but if you listen to it its a really strong album and far more accessible than the meandering introspection that was \\"american life\\" The songs presented here are bouncy and upbeat. If you get caught up on the lyrics or the samples you're gonna miss the point and the fun.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is back !!! After the so so inspired Americal Life, she's back doing what she knows how to do : DANCE, GROOVEY, ENJOYABLE MUSIC. <br />This album is full of little gems and will appeal to everybody. From the catchy Hung UP, to the spacey and grovey Get Together, Jump and Let It Will Be are also a highlight !!
B000BGR0OM|3.0|The British duo of Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox crafted some of the most intelligent pop songs of the 1980's. While experimenting with different musical styles throughout their career it is Annie's recognisable vocals and image that helped shape the duo's idnetity.<br /><br />The latest collection \\"Ultimate Collection\\" is new version of their greatest hits originally released in 1991 (with various tracklistings). For the casual fan this an amazing cd. All the major US and UK hits are included such as their international hit \\"Sweet Dreams (are made of this)\\", UK #1 \\"there must be angel (playing with my heart) as well as two new tracks \\"i've got a life\\" and \\"just another love affair\\".<br /><br />Fans of the act will no doubt notice that the duo completely ignored their 1989 album \\"We two are one two\\" as well as the soundtrack to the film \\"1984\\" which spawned the minor hit \\"Sexcrime\\". Personally I was disappointed that they also chose not to include \\"i love to listen to (beethoven)\\" a single (and minor hit) from  their album \\"Savage\\".<br /><br />The booklet is amazing and much better than the foldout that was inlcuded in previous hits packages.<br /><br />Overall a decent collection but I wouldnt call it an \\"ultimate\\" collection due to its failure to cover all their albums. Casual fans will find it to be a Fantastic package- given that its the Eurythmics we're talking about who could argue?
B000003N7K|2.0|John Coltrane is overwhelmed by the dated, drippy ballads on this album. In the 60's, every jazz musician had to do a ballad album just the same as everyone did a bossanova album. The music audience who had either given up jazz for rock or could not deal with jazz that was more cerebral were putting pressure on declining jazz sales. John Coltrane watered down his sound for a few ballad albums and then went right back to his real \\"sheets of sound\\" force of nature.  Even \\"My Favorite Things\\" was transformed into a transcental experience.  This album though clearly sounds forced. If you dislike Coltrane because you don't find him accessible, you might enjoy this album. However, you are missing out on the real deal.
B00005JO17|3.0|Chicken Little takes a chance and decides to warn the fair citiens of Oakey Oaks that a piece of the sky has fallen. When the townsfolk mistake an acorn for the supposed missing piece of sky, he is completely humiliated. Even his dad is embarassed and ashamed of him. A year later another piece of the sky falls down, but this time we witness it and see that it has alien tendencies. Chicken Little, who has temporarily redeemed himself (I won't say how, it would ruin the story for you!), is now too afraid to say anything this time, lest he lose his father's, friends and town's respect once again. His band of misfit friends encourage him to speak up, and his does so, with consequences.<br /><br />Parents take note: This is a cute little movie with a very powerful message. I enjoyed it very much, although there were moments when I was rolling my eyes with boredom during the truly  ridiculous scenes. However, Chicken Little won my heart -- it really is a cute movie with a very powerful underlying message at the end (the scene with Chicken Little and his dad in the movie theatre at the end is so touching!!). Don't wait for the DVD -- go out with your kids, and an open mind, and enjoy this movie!<br /><br />Cris Cunningham for Amazon.com
0553801503|3.0|No great artist is capable of producing awe-inspiring works on a consistent basis and George RR Martin is no exception. While many will agree that A Feast for Crows is not the action packed, edge of your seat, nail biting work many were expecting, these are not reasons to capitulate and throw in the towel.      Whether you think A Feast for Crows is downright awful, just average or a worthy successor to books 1,2 and 3, I think we all can say with a fairly high degree of confidence that regardless of your views on Feast, the series in total, is still some of the best fantasy written.    For many a Feast is a departure from the first 3 books of the series in a number of ways including a deceleration in action and an absence of well-liked POV characters.  However, the writing remains pristine Martin and we all know that at some future point the story will clearly accelerate again as we are reintroduced to many POV characters that are absent in Feast.    That being said, could Feast have been constructed in a way that would have better enabled it to be the successor to Storm that many of us were expecting? Probably.  Should this in anyway, cause anyone who has heretofore invested time and money in books 1,2 and 3, or new comers to the Series not to read Feast and subsequent books or start the series altogether? ABSOLUTELY NOT.  Martin has told us he thinks the series should be wrapped up in about 7 or 8 books and based upon where we are in the story this can be accomplished assuming he makes no Jordanian side treks.    In the end, if the next few books return to the pace we are accustomed to, with the POV characters we miss (this is more a publishing mistake than any fault of Martin's) then dealing with Feast (for those who found it wanting) will still have been a price worth paying.    In sum, while Feast is probably not the strongest of the 4 books in the series, this is in no way a justification for not starting or continuing the series as Mr. Martin certainly has earned enough of our respect and writing capital that we should give him a bit of slack and let him finish the incredible world he has created for us.
0679409874|5.0|Still a great book.  Has lasted not because of its silly plot turns in romance, but because of its one-dimensional characatures of English society in her time, with the perfect heroine, Elinor, at its core.  Everyone else falls into a niche, is a type, but as the satire is at times very pointed, the story is forgiven.  What is not so obvious, because Austen was probably not aware of it, is the utter dependence of all these peoples' lives on the servants who support them.  These people do nothing.  They walk, eat, dress, visit, read, play games and music, and do needlework or write letters.  That's it, with an occasional shopping trip thrown in.  It is this underlying life, the life of the servants, that is never mentioned.  Only one, Thomas, has any lines at all.  It beats me how they filled their days.  They simply lived to amuse themselves.
B00097DXZS|5.0|[...]    Anyway, on to the review of the CD: On first listen I was a little dissappointed, considering that the CD is about 20 minutes shorter than Santana's other collaborative offerings, but on repeated listens I find it to be awesome!    The first 2 tracks, \\"Hermes\\" and \\"El Fuego\\" are classic Santana at its finest, and a great way to kick off the album.    I can't get enough of lead single \\"I'm Feeling You\\" featuring Michelle Branch and her new band The Wreckers and find it to be slightly better even than \\"Game of Love\\" from Shaman.  As lead reviewer said with Shaman, \\"Game of Love\\" was the pop song of 2002, with no help from Carlos himself.  Well, the same could be said for \\"I'm Feeling You\\" in 2005 except that Pop seems to have its head stuck so far up its a$$ that it fails to recognize it, as it's having trouble breaking #40 on most pop charts.  It does seem to be doing well on VH1 and Adult Contemporary Radio, though.    Moving along, \\"My Man\\" is a great infusion of soul from Mary J. Blige, and a little rap from Big Boi (his 2 raps, underlied by Santana solos, are really the only time true rap appears on the whole CD).  The song reaches an amazing conclusion as Mary J. combines her best ad-libs with Santana's searing licks.  Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler appears on the next track, \\"Just Feel Better,\\" and the result is what \\"Don't Wanna Miss A Thing\\" or \\"Fly Away From Here\\" might be like if they contained Santana solos.  This one took a little while to grow on me, but just like the slower Aerosmith songs, it soon became one of my faves.  Still, it's one of the weaker songs on the CD.  Will.i.am channels the spirit of funk bands like Earth Wind and Fire and P-Funk for the next number \\"I Am Somebody.\\"  The result is a very pepped-up, funky number with plenty of hooks, and 4 Santana solos just serve to spice it up even more!   Next, the guests finally get an intermission for the more classic track \\"Con Santana.\\"  Several reviewers are saying he's big-headed fornaming a song about himself, and that might be the case, but it's nothing new.  He has a few album titles which feature his name and the instrumental \\"Santana Jam\\" to his credit even before the 1999 comeback.  The song?  If you like classic Santana you will like it.    Moving on, we come to the longest song on the CD: the Anthony Hamilton collabo \\"Twisted,\\" which is most like Shaman's \\"Sideways\\" by Citizen Cope, in that it's the folkiest song on the CD.  But this song has a little more Santana and a little less guest than \\"Sideways.\\"  It's good, but about as weak as \\"Just Feel Better,\\" but like it grows on you.  \\"Trinity,\\" the next song, is not at all what I expected, since it contains renowned Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett and Pedal Steel virtuoso Robert Randolph.  I expected that Santana's trademark solos would be surrounded by a combination of thrashing riffs and gentle twang, making for a very unique number.  However, in reality the licks played by the three sound very much the same!  In the end, the song is a great instrumental and serves well as a bridge to the next song.  Caribbean sensation Sean Paul and British soul princess Joss Stone may seem mismatched in the next track, \\"Cry Baby Cry,\\" but with Santana's solos the whole thing works very well together.  Next is \\"Brown Skinned Girl\\" from American Idol finalist Bo Bice.  Every time I listen to this song, I think it has the greatest potential to be this album's \\"Smooth,\\" as the chorus has a similar feeling to that song or Rob Thomas's solo effort \\"Lonely No More.\\"  A great track with plenty of Santana soloing.  Pentultimately is the album's true gem, \\"I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love\\" the match made in Heaven with Los Lonely Boys.  This song is incredible and seems to remind me of \\"Why Don't You and I\\" from Shaman, but it is truthfully unique and near perfect!  The album ends as it begins with classic Santana and the song \\"Da Tu Amor.\\"  This is a great track that even gets jazzy toward the end.  \\"Oye Como Va\\" 2005, anyone?  Finally, this album may not have the impact of Supernatural, but it deserves to have more impact than Shaman.  Pick it up for yourself, but be careful, as there might still be a few bad copies with the rootkit out there.  Viva Santana!

B00009UW0N|5.0|What more can be said about this micro-budgetmasterpiece shot in South Pasadena that scared the crap out of millions of people? The first image most people see in their mind when you say 'Halloween' is this film! John Carpenter's 3rd major film made him and girlfriend at that time, Debra Hill, 'overnight' sensations in the<br /><br />'business'. Outstanding on all levels cinematically, his music also<br /><br />was composed with perfection.We have all been waiting for the director's commentary and its finally here! Unrelenting suspense and horror which many,many directors have never been able to copy-Even though they tried! Bags and bags of rotten cinematic candy in the forms of 'Prom Night', 'Graduation Day', and 'Hell Night' cashed in on the crazed killer idea. Alot of other flushable 'Halloween' sequels followed, too. None have come close to the original. They never will. The current trend of 'PG-13' horror films is only beginning. We will never see another great 'R' rated horror film again.Unfortunately, the slimy 'industry' pinheads who drive their Range Rovers and Mercedes SUV's on the 101 freeway at rediculous speeds only to tailgate you and honk, don't care about<br /><br />the integrity of films anymore. They only see dollar signs and their trophy wives' greedy smiles. Horror films are a write-off.<br /><br />Carpenter's 'Halloween' will live on as the true original and the Holy Grail of his career, as well. Donald Pleasance-R.I.P.

0767827716|3.0|Absolutely one of Stephen King's finest stories is brought to the screen in 1983 by none other than the master horror director, John Carpenter ('Halloween'/'The Fog'). As a kid, I had finished reading the book (twice!) and was the biggest Carpenter fan, as well. The casting for this film is dead-on with Kieth Gordon (whatever became of him?) as Arnie and John Stockwell('Top Gun'was his last film?') as Dennis.Let's not forget Alexandra Paul, one of the hottest actresses of the 80's-Wow!<br /><br /> Filmed out here in the Santa Clarita Valley ( CA ) It was tough to imagine it doubling as Libertyville,PA. The Carpenter<br /><br />magic is all here, he also composed the music for the film, but there are several key elements that are missing from the book. So many things were just missing, or altered, that ultimately, the film fails to truly tell the full story of the evil 1958 Plymouth Fury.I blame that on the amateur screenwriter, Bill Phillips. Overall, a very entertaining film. Carpenter should be proud of it, but as a King fan for 22 years, I am hard to please.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Like somebody said before, this is a album for people who dont really like Madonna. All the die-hard Madonna fans who complain about the songs all sounding the same are not use to listening to techno,drum & bass,industrial,trance,etc. On first listen, this is what a good electronic dance album should sound like(one long continuous song)& after repeated listens the songs start to show themselves. If you hate Madonna but like electronic music & can listen to this album without thinking about her celebrity life you might really enjoy this.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This is probably the best re-release I've ever seen put together for a standard studio album that's a current release. It's very impressive. You get 18 great songs plus 4 videos. All of the new songs sound fantastic. This is really a rare opportunity because most recording artists don't release their videos on DVD with their album. Even if you already have the regular version, I would definitely get this one also. And if you don't have the first, then this is the one to get. I really think that Mariah made the album better with the additional songs and videos. It's a noteworthy effort. I'll definitely be playing this version from now on. And this isn't some kind of gimmick where they had the songs and just waited until later. So you're not getting leftovers that didn't make it the first time. These are new. That's why I think this is special circumstance where the second version is actually an improvement upon the first. And that was a difficult task since the original is very good. But they succeeded.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I bought this CD without looking carefully enough at the packaging - it contains copyright \\"protection\\" that prevents you from being able to rip the tracks to your computer or load them onto an mp3 player. You can only listen to it on your computer if you let it install its special software on your system. If I buy a CD I think I should be able to listen to it on my own computer without letting Sony/BMG litter my system with their crappy software. Since you can already buy the album from the iTunes store, I don't really see why they don't want you to be able to listen to it on your mp3 player. Are they expecting me to purchase the album twice? Screw that! I already bought the CD, I should be able to listen to it however I want.

B000BGH22W|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this CD when I *first* heard it, but overall I like it now that I've heard it more.  It has a \\"classical orchestra\\" feel to it, which is very nice, but a little disappointing since I missed the eccentric feel that I was used to hearing for the first three movies (which seemed to capture the magic a bit more).  Because of that, I didn't expect this music to go well with the movie, but as I watched the movie, it seemed to fit very well.    I instantly loved the \\"Rita Skeeter\\" song.  I really enjoy the way it captures the sneaky, mischievousness of her character!  I also thought that \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" portrayed the two quidditch teams very nicely.    It took me a little bit to really like most of the other songs, but after having listened to them more, and after having seen the movie, they've grown on me.    About the last three songs...  I would have liked them better if they were on the CD in the opposite order.  The screaming at the beginning of \\"Do the Hippogriff\\" was startling (I wish someone had warned me to turn the volume down) and seemed out of place.  In addition, I expected the Weird Sisters to be... sisters... rather than men.  (But they did a marvelous job of working these songs into the movie.)  The lyrics of \\"Do the Hippogriff\\", were quite funny at times, though.    Back when I read the book, I was paranoid throughout the entire thing for Harry's sake.  But I was greatly heartened when I heard this CD, because it sounds very lighthearted at times and helps me to momentarily forget the seriousness of Harry's situation and just enjoy things for a while.  This lightheartedness is perhaps my favorite aspect of this CD (and the movie), when compared to the book.  :)
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah Carey has proven that after 15+ years of being in the industry, she still has what it takes to dominate the universe. After releasing a string of Top Hits including Def Jams biggest ever single, We Belong Together and Its Like That, back Mariah bounces. It's easy to see why Mariah is the biggest selling female artist of all time, with tracks like 'Get Your Number', Shake It Off' and the ever impressive 'We Belong Together'. Shortly after the release of 'Shake It Off', Mariah is back in the studio producing yet again and this time its the Platinum Edition of Mimi. Containing 4 new tracks including the 'We Belong Together Remix' and another big hit 'Dont Forget About Us' while Twista lends another hand on So Lonely (Part 2 of One and Only). With the addition of the new tracks you cant help but think this is the icing on the cake for what was already a superb musical masterpeice. If you already own the album there is even more to entice, this edition comes with an included DVD featuring full length video clips of the singles released from the album plus an interview and a link to the video of 'Don't Forget About Us'. This is one package you can't refuse. The Emancipation Of Mimi is 2005's biggest record, and with Mariah scooping 4 vibe awards (Artist of the Year, Best Album, best R&B song We Belong Together and best voice) things are looking good for Mariah. And so they should! (!You did good girl!) And to put one thing straight for all the people wondering if they should buy this: Its 5 dollars more then the Platinum Edition and for that 5 dollars you get 4 new tracks, and 5 videos!!! I mean how can that not be good value!!! If you are a fan of Mariahs music and want to add a worthwhile album to your collection buy this album, you will not be disappointed! Also you get all new pictures inside the album booklet. This isn't a sloppy release its a release for all Mariah fans, if you don't like it 1. Dont buy it 2. Dont waste space on amazon writing stupid reviews!!!     Forget all the hating reviews from all the Madonna Fans, they should be enjoying their artists success instead of hating over another artists' amazing success!    And Why dont y'all check out Mary J. Blidge's New Album \\"The Breakthrough\\" Its hot!

0316666343|3.0|The Lovely Bones is the tale of a family, the Salmons, torn asunder after the brutal murder of their eldest daughter, Suzie, in 1973. In a peculiar, yet intriguing twist, it is Suzie herself who narrates the story from that which she has termed the \\"Inbetween\\": The first stage of heaven from which she now watches as the aftermath of her death unfolds. The Inbetween is a subjective experience for each soul and can be anything to the dead that the dead desire -- save for life itself.<br /><br />Back on Earth, the sudden and violent nature of the Salmons' loss, as well as the fact that Suzie's murderer has not been apprehended, shakes the family -- and the small, close-knit Pennsylvanian community -- to its core. Suzie's father Jack, a loving and kind-hearted man, is so utterly deflated by his pain that all he can do is obsess over the suspected identity of Suzie's killer, eventually doing so at the expense of his wife and surviving children; wife Abigail, Suzie's mom, is borne into her own hell after her daughter's death, one in which she believes that she is being punished for never having wanted children to begin with; sister Lyndsey, younger than Suzie by only a year, grows stoic and strong while trying to pick up the remnants of a life that now includes a dead sister and two distant and preoccupied parents; and four-year-old Buckley struggles to understand just why his once-happy family is falling apart. Also touched by this grizzly event are Ray Singh, the boy who gave Suzie her first and only kiss, and Ruth Conners, the brilliant outcast with a special ability to feel the dead.<br /><br />For much of the book, we follow these characters, and a few more, as their lives weave in and out of each other's, struggling not only with their grief, but with the way in which that grief is effectively changing the landscape of their world forever. It is poignant, disturbing, at times dreadfully sad and at others, full of whimsy. There is no denying that this book is sentimental bordering on maudlin, but, for the most part, that's OK.<br /><br />Unfortunately, by the last quarter of The Lovely Bones, Ms. Sebold seems to have decided that she's thrown too many balls into the air: Many of the plot threads come to an abrupt dead-end, which leaves one asking why they had been introduced at all. In addition, the tone of the novel changes and becomes an exercise in the fantastic, appearing too much like amateurish self-indulgence on the part of the author. One scene, in particular, as alluded to by another reviewer, is so out of left field and over-the-top for this partuclar story, that it takes the reader out of the moment -- and it's very, very hard to get back in.<br /><br />In the end, Sebold takes too many easy ways out with her characters, giving them -- and the reader -- so much less than they deserve. We are left with no real answers, no satisfactory climax, no sense of loose ends being tied. This is a story with so much potential, one that could've been done justice by the right storyteller. Too bad that Sebold wasn't that.<br /><br />An interesting, yet highly flawed novel that is worth a rent from the library more than a purchase.timental bordering on maudlin, but, for the most part, that's OK. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, by the last quarter of The Lovely Bones, Ms. Sebold seems to have decided that she's thrown too many balls into the air: Many of the plot threads come to an abrupt dead-end, which leaves one asking why they had been introduced at all.

B00007G1ZC|2.0|What a disappointment. I am being very honest. Based on reviews herein, I thought this was going to be a visual masterpiece filled with stunning imagery and a poetic journey for the mind. Sadly that is not what this film is. There are far more, dare I say greater Japanese films that will fill your heart and mind. I agree with an earlier reviewer (scroll down), I think that many people have latched onto the idea and popular notion that \\"this is great film making\\" because an academy may have chosen to honor an aging film maker some 15 years ago. This typically happens with \\"foreign\\" films being reviewed by Westerners for whom appeal lies in that which they think represents the culture or community or creative prowess of the foreigner.<br /><br />I am writing this review from Japan where I live and I can assure you there are several astounding works out there that superbly capture the essence of Japan whilst both visually and emotionally challenging the viewer. The \\"moral lessons\\" contained within the vignettes of Dreams (honor your elders, respect nature, value tradition, be a good person) are so trite and transparent, and forced upon the viewer in each of the short segments that to me it felt more like an assembly line of Japanese Aesop's Fables. In short, I am not convinced that this film has withstood the test of time (okay well 15 years at least) to captivate and intrigue and challenge the viewer. If you are truly looking for something palatable from Japan which will make you think about life, values and human relations, I recommend Kikujiro or Spirited Away for that matter. Those are both places to start if you are new to Japanese film and would like to be inspired by truly excellent contemporary story telling the Japanese way.<br /><br />By the way, the fact that Spielberg and Lucas helped produce and that Scorcese appears in this film is pretty much a red flag that it is probably not great Japanese film making at its best.

1400032717|4.0|This book was amazing. I never would have read a book like this but I didn't know what to read next since I finished all the Harry Potter books. My teacher was telling us about this book and what it was about. I thought it sounded good because it was written from a different perspective. This book was very different. This book was told in first person from a 15 year old boy named Christopher who was autistic. I thought that it was cool when he wrote a new chapter he would label them with prime numbers because he liked prime numbers. My favorite part was when he went into his father's room to find his book. When he found his book he also found letters from his mother who died two years ago, but the letters were written recently. Also I liked the part where he went to find his mother all by himself. That was very impressive. This book is very inspiring because Christopher is showing us to push our limits. Christopher hates large crowds and hates it when people touch him or new places, but he kept going on despite these factors. This was an awesome book.
B000003JAY|3.0|Released in 1987 when Billy Idol reached #1 with a live version of Tommy James and the Shondells' \\"Mony Mony,\\" Vital Idol became at that time, the closest thing to a best of until the much-needed Greatest Hits compilation.  Thing is, it was a bunch of remixes and in the case of \\"White Wedding,\\" the concatenation of a Part II, namely more guitarwork, space age synths, and an additional verse  to make it an eight minute plus number.  And face it-key numbers like \\"Rebel Yell\\" and \\"Eyes Without A Face\\" were missing, which given this collection, may be a relief, because they avoided being tampered with.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the version of \\"Mony Mony\\" here isn't the live version that made it to the top.  Rather, it's the Downtown Mix.  And as if to capitalize on the success of that live version, \\"Hot In The City\\" was reissued, where it placed at #48, worse than its original #23 peak in 1982.  The Exterminator Mix of this song isn't too bad.<br /><br />Not much has changed with the Uptown Mix of the punk-disco of Idol's classic, \\"Dancing With Myself\\" though an extended bass, the clapping drum track, and reprises of instrumental bridge and last verse make it close to six minutes.<br /><br />As for \\"Flesh For Fantasy,\\" from the repeated snarling guitar and tweaked stretching of Idol going \\"flesh,\\" I recognize the version used in the video for the same song, although there are a lot more added sounds and segments in this Below The Belt Mix, which clocking in at 7:04 makes it the second longest song.<br /><br />\\"Superstars Return to Splendor with Rock and Roll Inferno\\" barks Idol before the harder guitar riffs set against the familiar drum machines opens the Mother of Mercy Mix of \\"To Be A Lover.\\" This mix doesn't tweak the original too much, so I don't mind it as much. The presence of some seductive female vocals in some instrumental parts give it an extra something.<br /><br />Some poppy techno synths give \\"Catch My Fall\\" the Remix Fix an interesting treatment.  The thudding opening basso-type synths ironically sound like the same synths that open Tiffany's \\"I Think We're Alone Now,\\" the other artist who went to #1 covering a Tommy James song.  Gee, maybe he could've done his own version as a joke...<br /><br />With only eight songs, and its being eclipsed by the official domestic greatest hits, the bottom line on Vital Idol now can be summed up as, \\"Yeah, it's not bad, but why?\\".

B000B8QF14|4.0|Bullet In A Bible is, like all live album releases by major labels, a greatest hits cd with screams and chants thrown in here and there. Not that that's always a bad thing mind you, but that's really what it boils down to. <br />First of all, the cd. Judged on its own merit, a great live album through and through. Green Day knows how to get a crowd going and this cd doesn't shy away from that. However, you need to know that the track list on Amazon.com is not the final cd list. There are a total of six songs missing, which is too bad because the songs that are missing from the final release are all really cool songs. Although there is a limited amount of space on a cd (about 80 min.), the songs could have been put back on the dvd, which they are not. But what the final cut of the cd is, is a great sounding live show, making me wish I was there when it happened.  <br />As for the dvd, this dvd was released with a great amount of hype surrounding it. It marks one of the biggest shows Green Day has ever played, on the most successful tour of their career. Once again, with six songs being cut from the final release, the show feels somewhat sort and missing something.  <br />The fourteen songs that did make the cut however, (the bulk of them being from American Idiot) strung together with interview snippits and docu-back-stage passish clips, comprise what is the best live dvd I have ever seen. The sheer size of the venue and the whopping 65,000+ crowd is truly breathtaking at times. <br />The songs are played hard and with alot of passion.  <br />One thing I liked to see was that Green Day play all their old songs with the same amount of fire and intensity as their new ones. Nothing is worse than watching a band play their songs looking like they're sick of playing them. You won't find that here. <br />Basically, whether you're a new or newly-renewed fan of Green Day thanks to American Idiot, or someone who prefers their old stuff better (like me), Bullet In A Bible is well worth the fifteen or twenty bucks for the package. Let's just hope they decide to release a 'Director's Cut' or something down the road and throw the six songs they cut back in the mix. I'm sure with those songs this would have been a five star review easy.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|the album has failed to capture what it's been publicised for, it's not at all that dancy, the music is sampled from all over the place, and i can honastly say that the only good song on it is Isaac, even though i am against her bringing her beliefs into her work, so all in all, if u didn't buy the album yet, don't, it ain't worth it, the queen of dance and pop has finally lost her rythm.. i wish i can give this album a lower rating, but amazon's lowest rating is only 1 star, and even that madonna doesn't deserve
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This DVD set is becoming the most watched DVD in my collection.  The video is a compilation from a 3 day \\"guitar festival\\" organized for Eric Clapton to support his Crossroads Drug and Alcohol rehab center in Aruba.<br /><br />I must say that if you enjoy guitar music, you HAVE to have this DVD in your collection.  That's not to say you'll like ALL of the performances.  This is a mixed bag of music, from Blues and Rock 'n Roll to Country and Bluegrass to Jazz and even an Indian/Hindu number.  Every artist here is technically excellent for the style of music they play.<br /><br />Low points for me were:  the Indian piece; Steve Vai who is technically a good player, but I don't care for his style or his attitude; and John Mclaughlin.  McLaughlin is a great guitarist, but, again, his style really isn't my taste.<br /><br />High Points:  Most of the rest of the video.  Clapton is top notch, as always.  BB King, Buddy Guy and the rest of the \\"old blues\\" artists were quite good and interesting to see in this setting.  I enjoyed seeing John Mayer play to a crowd that is a bit older than his typical fan base.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed seeing players that are much less known...some even new to me.  It's good to see guys like David Hidalgo and Eric Johnson get more exposure.  I wish the video had a few more songs by these guys.  Dan Tyminski was quite good, although he seems a little out of place here.  (he's the guy who played and sang \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" on the movie \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" that George Clooney lip-synched to.)<br /><br />I'm not a country music fan, but I even enjoy seeing Vince Gill here.<br /><br />Joe Walsh is always entertaining.  He has two solo numbers as well as a \\"cameo\\" backing up James Taylor while Taylor does his \\"Joe Walsh imitation\\".<br /><br />From those who were at the concert, it seems that some of the best music at the festival didn't make it to the DVD.  That's unfortunate.  It's too bad they don't release a larger or second volume set.<br /><br />The casual viewer or music fan may not enjoy this set as much as I do.  Keep in mind that there are many styles here, and the purpose of the DVD is not necessarily to only present the best of the festival, but rather to provide a sampling of what the festival had to offer.  As a guitarist, I'm fascinated watching players who are GOOD even when I don't always enjoy their style of playing.  If you are a guitarist or interested in learning to play guitar, you simply MUST own this DVD.a larger or second volume set. <br /> <br />The casual viewer or music fan may not enjoy this set as much as I do.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is by far one of Madonna's best! Its impossible to not sing along and even dance! totally back to her roots, no preaching or ballads. Non stop dance songs! Stuart price is a musical genious and him and Madonna are a match made in musical heaven!!! <br />invite round some friends and open a bottle of wine and press play! You will love it!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Easily her best record in a long time or ever.  Every track is a keeper.  Brilliantly produced,sung.  It's like a dream. <br />
B000BGH22W|5.0|Four months ago, I heard that the production would replace John Williams by Patrick Doyle! I was afraid of this idea. But three weeks ago when I litsend the new soundtrack at [...] I was surprised. I think that Patrick Doyle has captured the spirit that John Williams gave to the Harry Potter movie series! I like all the tracks, but especially I like very much the new main theme \\"The story Continues\\"! I am waiting the movie to come out in cinemas in my country at 24/11/05. Well done Patrick Doyle, you have done an excellent job!:D
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna indicated this album had no messages, but fun, fun, fun.  I agree and disagree.  This album is VERY fun.  However, there ARE messages in this album; they're just presented in a fun, dancy/pop way.  Ray of Light WAS my favorite Madonna album... that is until now.  For anyone who enjoys Madonna's music, this album is a must have.
B000002KLP|5.0|Man, what can I say about this album but CLASSIC!!    Prince was 22 when he dropped this one and forever served notice to the world that he was a different   kind of kat and that the whole scape of the pop world as   we had known it at that time was going in HIS direction!   Never one to conform or confine himself to any one   particular musical genre, he delves into new wave & punk   (Dirty Mind, When You Were Mine), then grooves us with the nasty but infectious \\"Do It All Night\\"...  Then he goes into the album's only slow jam, the lamenting  \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\", which is a classic to true Prince fans who go all the way back with him!   Then Side 2 opens with the punk-funky \\"Uptown\\",   which truly captures the vibe of the times of pre-aids, experimental, ambisexual, free-lovin'   late 70's / early 80's america!--  Which is the world that I came of age in!   (I was 16 when this album came out and it   seemed that Prince was reading my mind!)   Then at the end of \\"Uptown\\" there's a cool   synthesizer effect that swooshes us right into   the classic gut-bucket synth funk of \\"Head\\",   which is self- explanatory!   Then, at the end of that, the same synth swoosh   takes us into Prince's tabu tale of incest as a streetkid   of 16 who lives (albeit antagonistically!)  with a half sister of 32 who is determined to teach   him her warped view of the facts of life or else   \\"Put him on the street again!\\"--  A punked-out, rockin', fast-moving piece   that caused quite a stir back then!  Then the synth swoosh takes us to one of my   all-time fave Prince \\"Party Til' You Pass Out!\\" jams....  \\"Party Up\\"!!  This song sends this classic album out with a bang!    The \\"Dirty Mind Tour\\" of late '80 and early '81 was   quite a spectacle to behold! Prince broke all the   taboos of sexuality, fashion, staging and just brought   a whole new energy to the game that just caught   you on fire!  He was the opening act (at that time!)   for then \\"supposedly\\" notorious Rick James (RIP),whose \\"Fire It Up\\" tour was all the rage!   But to those of us who were lucky enough to see it,   it soon became apparent that Prince's flame   made poor Rick's look like a bic lighter!  After about 3 months of what was supposed to be   a 6 month tour as Rick's opening act,   tired of being upstaged, Rick James fired Prince from   the  tour and harbored a bitter resentment of him which   lasted up until about a year before his death in 2004   when he had to finally acknowledge that Prince Rogers Nelson was indeed a true genius and a force of nature!    If you don't have this album in your collection,   you're short-changed 4-real!
B000BJS4OY|4.0|This is the album that put Bruce on the rock and roll map--and deservedly so. In its newly remastered version, it's a sonic wonder. And the 1975 concert DVD sounds superb, too!<br /><br />Great package, albeit with a few minor drawbacks. The concert footage, with a set list similar to the historic ten Bottom Line shows in NYC, is a bit on the dark side.  No one had the forethought about future formats to properly light it. And the booklet included is not very special with some unspectacular photos and an essay taken from a book that's been around for a while.<br /><br />Aside from that the music is still as fresh as it was 30 years and proves why Springsteen grew to be the rock and roll icon he is today and among the top echelon of rock's greatest artists..
B0000033OT|5.0|Every time I hear Donny Hathaway, I am so moved   with both great joy and awe of his god-given gifts   as well as sadness over how his career bascially went   under the radar while he was alive and of course,   how his life ended so tragically!   I often think about how pleasantly surprised he would   have been to see his work have such an influence on a   whole generation of younger talents who were but embryos   when he was doing his thing all those years ago!   I also imagine him being pleased by his daughter   Layla and her success!   This was his best and most cohesive studio album   and it has some great gems on it..my faves are:   \\"Je Vouz Aime Vouz (That Means I Love You)\\", \\"Misty\\",   \\"Sugar Lee\\" and \\"Thank You Master For My Soul\\"   all which kill me in their own unique ways!  Of course, I prefer the live versions of \\"The Ghetto\\"   and \\"Young, Gifted & Black\\" to the ones on here.  Donny was one of the few artists who could create   something live that was better than what he did   in the studio!  Donny Hathaway is the invisible every man of   R&B / Jazz / Soul with a strong gospel-inflection,  and his influence, both vocal and instrumental-wise is eternal!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is a great little movie. Not The Best Movie Ever Made, as some would say, but a fun experience. If you enjoy humor out of left-field, tight action, good acting, and a pretty cast, then you will enjoy this movie. I give it five stars for all the fun I had. It's a real romp, though it does get nice and dark towards the end. <br /> <br />Ignore the zealots from both sides; the \\"Whedon is God\\" fans, and the \\"Serenity SUXS!\\" folks. Both sides have agendas. View the movie and judge yourself. I think most people will enjoy it.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|While I like the song \\"Hung Up\\", I have to say I listened to this album a bunch of times and I have to say: overall, the album is mediocre at best. If you think about it, this album is from the same artist that gave us classic pop music. Madonna's \\"Like A Prayer\\" album had one hit after another. Even if I put \\"Bedtime Stories\\" side to side with this album, \\"Confessions...\\" doesn't share well. Everybody complains about \\"American Life\\" (that one sucked too!) but at least you had a song like \\"Die Another Day\\" on it. I think the problem with Madonna is that she is trying too hard. The beats are not hip enough (Hip Hop has the best beats around: Kanye West, 50 Cent, etc.) The songs are not fun. I feel like they're trying to teach me something with a dance beat in the back. The album feels tired and uninspired. Sorry, I've been a Madonna fan since forever, but I'm getting tired of her trying to make a quick buck at my expense. Give something with quality (the quality I'm expecting from somebody like Madonna) and then we'll see.
0792844882|3.0|This film was really bashed when it came out and Liz Berkley was lambasted for it.  But I really enjoyed it. It's not a great movie but I enjoyed the energy and sleazeness portrayed by the actors and dancers.  Gina Girshon is always good at playing nasty.  It's a little sleazy slice of LasVegas.
B00000JLWW|3.0|\\"Titanic\\" is one of those movies that I dig up from the bottom of my VHS collection once or twice a year and always enjoy watching it. However, my enjoyment is always disturbed by some annoyingly unrealistic details towards the end of the movie:<br /><br />- Rose never seems to get cold although she is wearing nothing but a flimsy gauze evening gown. And you never see people's breath until the very end, when Rose is floating in the water on a piece of debris. Come on, we're in the middle of the Atlantic in the middle of the night. Isn't it cold outside?<br /><br />- The Rose-saves-Jack-from-the-Master-at-Arms'-room scene:<br />I'm sorry, but nobody could be so totally unaffected by ice-cold saltwater, especially a spoiled, indoor type of high-society girl like Rose - adrenaline rush or not. And all this after Jack's vivid description of the effects of ice cold water in the beginning of the movie.<br />I find the whole scene unnecessary, anyway. People are trying to escape from the sinking ship, they're running for their lives, fighting to get on the lifeboats - isn't that enough drama? Why do we need an act of female heroism here? It's your typical American action movie scene: somebody must rescue somebody else in a limited amount of time and, of course, succeeds. How predictable! Did anyone really think the director would kill Jack or Rose - or both - at his point? Bah!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|THE reedidition of The emancipation of mimi is a big event but Madonna's Fan are CRAZY and RIDICULOUS : They wanna do a PUB for the new album of the old woman : \\" Confessions on a dance floor\\".The reedition is wonderful with \\"its like that\\" , \\" we belong together\\" \\"shake it off\\" and \\"DON'T FORGET ABOUT US\\" !!! <br />Why do Madonna's fans do that ? Are they JEALOUS ? Maybe they have noting to do ! lol ! Mariah carey is The voice and Madonna's fans can do anything , Mariah is THE BEST ! BUY THIS ALBUM !!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I know there are already too many reviews for this disc. <br />It's absolutely incredible and awesome. <br />It really makes you want to stand up and dance. <br /> <br />I does suffer a bit in the second half, but only people who are not hardcore fans will notice. <br /> <br />SORRY is one of the BEST songs Madonna has made.  Kudos !
B000B8QF00|4.0|I want to know what happened to Unsexy too..  unless it's hiden and I have yet to find it.  I do really like the cd, but I was really really sad to not find unsexy.  Mine isn't on the cover either =o(
B000A3DFZE|1.0|If you wanted something like \\"Unplugged\\", for goodness sake don't buy this album.  It's just not wonderful.  I think that I will give it away - if I can find anyone who wants it!
B00004Y6NX|1.0|you enjoy long walks on the beach. Boring music with out any heart. Oh my god does this kinda music suck. This so boring how do u people sleep at night.... Probally pretty well if u listin to this crap.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna does it again...  <br />She gets better with the years. <br />Can't wait for the tour next summer... <br />A+
B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC is so unblievably talented all other bands can only walk in their shadow and hope to someday be half as great.  This CD has some of the most hardcore songs you'll ever hear. AC/DC kicks the crap out of whiny boring thumb suckers like greenday.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's latest album, COADF, is dance music at its very best! I'm SO excited and happy that Madonna basically made a full album with Stuart Price as producer.  I've always LOVED his music and remixes of her songs (like \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Nobody Knows Me\\").  He has a knack for coming up with some very cool retro grooves.   <br /> <br />That's the great thing about this album - that it's so dance-heavy.  I read Madonna say something about how she sometimes enjoys the remixes of her songs more than the originals and that idea fueled this new album.  And I can't agree with her more!  It'll be exciting to see if the upcoming remixes of songs like \\"Sorry,\\" and \\"Jump\\" can take these already perfect tunes and make them even better for the dancefloor.   <br /> <br />Oh, and upon first listen, the song \\"I Love New York\\" really stuck out for me. It has some kind of ridiculous lyrics .. however, Madonna delivers them in such a Punk Princess Queen of the Dancefloor way that I absolutely LOVE!!! <br /> <br />Also, the last song on the album, \\"Like it or Not\\" is classic Madonna at her very best. They lyrics are great and the sound is very different from the other songs on the album. It's basically a big, \\"like me or get the f*ck over it\\" song.  Great way to end an amazing album!
B000B8QF14|4.0|I once read somewhere in a Rolling Stone, 'round about Dookie, where someone recommended that I see Green Day before they sell out. I am quite astonished to say that after seeing this band live for the first time on this tour that the only thing they are selling out are the tickets.<br /><br />Here is a band which have reached an epoch in popular culture where a statement, an album and now a tour have redefined the essence of 70's punk rock for a new generation.<br /><br />I would like to recommend that you see this band live on this tour, second I would recommend that you add this tour cd/dvd to your collection.<br /><br />I would have given this a 5 star rating, but I don't believe in perfection.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's American Life album is SO much better than what you might have heard. Unfortunately, due to hot political times and her pulling the video for the lead-off single, American Life, this album was not recieved well.  Radio all but ignored it.  If Madonna released this album today, I guarantee it'd be a bigger hit.   <br /> <br />I, personally, love the song, American Life.  I think it's very different and the music is great.  However, I can see how it could turn some ppl off, especially with the rap (btw, I think the rap is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek ... i mean, at least she was being real and not rapping about things she doesn't know about).  Also, the ORIGINAL video to this song just makes the song WAY better.  It's one of Madonna's best videos and it's a shame that it hasn't been seen by the mainstream. <br /> <br />Highlights off this album are: <br /> <br />Nobody Knows Me - This song is just killer.  The remixes are awesome. <br /> <br />Easy Ride - great great great track!!!  One of my all-time favorite Madonna tunes!  It's so...haunting in a way. And the orchestral music blended in with the electro stuff is amazing. <br /> <br />Mother and Father - you have to see/hear Madonna perform this song live to truly appreciate it. It wasn't one of my favorites until I saw her perform it during her Re-Invention tour. <br /> <br />I'm So Stupid - A lot of people didn't like this song, thinking it was too self-absorbed.  I love it, especially the effects on her voice. <br /> <br />Love Profusion - Should have been a Madonna classic .. damned radio!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I didn't expect too much on this album because the first single (Hung up) doesn't sounds too creative to me. Turns out that Hung up is just an intro to this album. The mixing is cool. The music are tightly coupled, so there is no reason not to get the whole album. I like this album much more than the last one.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|Written, directed, and produced by Gallo, `The Brown Bunny' not surprisingly stars Gallo himself. When a film is made this way, people would naturally think that the film is all about Gallo and his life. In brilliantly original `Buffalo 66' it worked. In `The Brown Bunny' it fails because of the now notorious love scene, which is not only pointless but shows Gallo's ego-tripping film-making. <br /> <br />Gallo plays Bud Clay, a professional bike racer who is heading for California. In the rather lengthy opening scene, we see him riding a bike on the race course, making a circle again and again, suggesting the hero's never-ending search for something. <br /> <br />For Bud, 'something' is Daisy his love. But we are not allowed to know anything about his and Daisy's past until the last 20 minutes. Instead, during the road movie style narrative, Bud keeps on driving, going to the west, occasionally meeting girls whose names are all those of flowers. <br /> <br />And finally, the oral love scene with Daisy played by Chlo Sevigny. If you can find any meaning in this embarraing scene, (I mean, not in `love' but in 'oral'), please let me know. Explicit sex scenes (which I do not particularly dislike) often blur the other merits of the film, and this is exactly the case here. As you know, Gallo decided to cut the film by about 30 minutes after the debacle at Cannes Film Festival, but the sex scene remained in the film. What made Gallo include that part? Or what made Sevigny accept the role in the first place? <br /> <br />For all its self-indulgence, I like certain part of the film. The film beautifully captures the bleak atmosphere of the roadside in America, and though you may not agree with me, I don't find Gallo's acting so awful. But that may be because I now come to think that Gallo is always playing himself, a coolest guy with sad eyes who knows he would never be in the mainstream, and if you like Gallo (like my cousin), you would not hate him whatever he does. <br /> <br />Still, even avid fans of Gallo should admit that his recent films are not as good as pre-`Buffalo' era including amusing `Palookaville.' Why `The Code'? Why `Freeway II'? and why wretched Italian `The Undesirables'? And most of all, why this?
B000B8QEZG|5.0|After having read lots of rumors and news of what the album was gonna be like,and having heard it and read more reviews and all,I have come to the conclusion that this album is easily and very easily one of the best albums that she's released in her extensively varied career.I guess the people who have posted negative reviews about this album it's because they expect too much of a dance album,that it has to be deep or something and Madonna didn't make this album for that purpose.She recorded it,in her own words,for wanting to get people jump off their seats and dance.This album is for letting your hair down and shake your body,and Madonna succeeds to the hilt with that goal,and it definitely is a return to her roots.There are many moments in this album where she goes back to 1983 and it's the most amazing sensation ever. <br />If you feel like dancing and you don't wanna hear any more political deep stuff and you want to escape from reality,buy this album.Or if you just love Madonna and are a fan,buy this.You won't regret it at all.It's worth every penny. <br />And if you don't like it,go buy Mariah's awful efforts.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I've never written a review of a CD here before, and I'm not writing one now. I have not listened to this CD and, therefore, am not qualified to review it. I intend to buy it, and I expect to be keeping it in my CD player a lot of the time.<br /><br />I would just like to state the following...<br /><br />I'm not asking you to either like or dislike this CD. I happen to be a Springsteen fan, but that doesn't mean that you have to be. All I'm asking is that you at least listen to the CD one time before reviewing it, and that you review the CD, not the political leanings of the artist. Any legitimate complaints about the music, or about any potential Sony spyware issues, are welcome. I enjoy reading reviews both from readers that like and dislike a particular CD or artist. Your thoughtful opinions are always interesting. But please don't review a CD that you have never heard. I have never written a review of a Madonna CD or an Usher CD or a Michael Jackson CD because I don't enjoy that music and I have nothing constructive to add to a discussion about those artists. I doubt very much that anyone would really care whether I agree with their political opinions, and since I don't listen to their music, I can't comment intelligently on that.<br /><br />I do not think it is too much to ask that you at least listen to a CD, and that you review the CD without reference to the artist politics. Have the self-respect and dignity to know that most of use just don't care what you think about the politics. We DO care what you think about the music, but only if you have listened to it.<br /><br />Finally, I rated this with 5 stars only because I couldn't post this without a rating. I would have preferred not to issue a rating yet. However, since I had to give it a rating, I have rated it with my anticipated rating.
B000002UJQ|5.0|In a time when things seem cheap and nothing seems as brillaint or delicate as what the masters of composition have done, this proves that recent generations have something to offer the world besides cheap manufactured pop tunes. <br />This is such a dynamic album. There are so many emotions and messages displayed and there is a song for every mood. <br />The production on this album is in a word, gorgeous. I have this album on heavy rotation, and trite as it may be, think it totally rocks.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I confess I'ts ok.  But its not all that great.  I was really hoping for more.  Many of the songs sound alike.  I think shes lost it for the most part, and needs to hang it up.  But nonetheless I'm glad to file another on my cd rack (this one will not be in my cd changer)
0553801503|5.0|I'm going to make this short and sweet. Despite cutting half the characters out, most of which are my favourite characters (Tyrion, Jon, Daenerys), A Feast For Crows still holds up very well. It drips with just as much political intrigue as the previous installments. The only problem I have with the novel is that it feels like the entire book is a set up for A Dance With Dragons (the next book), and ends only with cliffhangers. However, there are definitely some big twists and plot advancement. <br /> <br />AFFC has made me froth at the mouth for the next book, which I hope will be coming out next year!

B0009IW88A|3.0|..they left out some of the best parts from the movie!!!  Where's the ending score?  The music at the ending credits was the best of all.  What happened to the music during the scene on the train and the death of Ducard?  Had I known this to be the case I would not have purchased it?  For the the music itself I give 5 stars, but I have to subtract two stars for the CD and the missing music.  I can only hope that there is a future \\"extended\\" edition in the works.
1878424319|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this book, but when I opened it I couldnt put it down. The beginning wasnt very good but as his theories develop they draw you in. This is the type of book you read over and over. It was a quick read, a very small book with easy to read information. I read it in one sitting. Read this book, it will change your life.
B000000W5N|4.0|What is it about the lot of us who review? Despite hundreds of reviews saying what we're going to inevitable repeat, we go ahead and review anyway. Are we that anxious to get our thoughts out there for someone to read? Does it make us feel closer to the band, the fans, the music? Who the hell knows. It just strikes me as funny even as I forge ahead with my review...<br />Self-examinations aside, this album rocks. So many great songs with many various styles from Memphis r'n'b to country, to straight ahead riff and roll. The ability to comfortably venture into different genres and emerge successfully with their own distinctive imprint is one of the many reasons I'm such a big fan of this band. There isn't a bad song on the recording, in fact there are some definitive Stones songs in the line-up. If a casual or nascent music fan wanted a Stones cd to try out, this is the one I'd recommend, in large part because it is a shorter and tighter cd than it's cousin Exile. If you don't like this album, you don't like the Rolling Stones.
0805076476|5.0|As I received my Lord of the Flies paper back a feeling of excitement swelled inside me, and it was because of my grade.  It was because I knew Fight Club was the next book on our 9th Grade Honors Literature reading curriculum.  I had anticipated reading and discussing this book since the moment I bought it from the school bookstore.  Of course, I had seen the movie, but even those who hadn't still had the same feeling of enthusiasm just by looking at the title.  But before we could begin reading this book we received terrible news.  The school administration had decided to withdraw Fight Club from the curriculum.  The thrill was taken from right beneath the noses of every freshman in the school.  But we reacted, petitions, letters, and inquisitions flooded the Dean's office.  But despite our efforts we never got to read this book as a class.  But of course the was just the motivation a teenager needs to read a book.  \\"Why would they ban this book?  Sex, drugs, violence?  Sweeeet\\".  Every kid in the school most likely picked up the book and buried their nose in it.   <br />      Fight Club.  The title in itself is intimidating.  The movie was a masterpiece, but I never realized there was a book behind it, I never realized there was a single mastermind behind this work.  Immediately as you begin the book you are confused, but you keep reading.  Palahniuk style of writing in fight club is very dramatic and very abstract.  Bits and pieces are presented to you, but you still cannot piece together a plot or story yet.  You read on hoping to find some answers, and before you know it the book is glued to your fingers.  It is hard to describe the emotion in Fight Club to someone who hasn't read it.  Fight Club is full of deceptions and hidden meanings, only to be explained later on.  This book does not let you down at any one point, you keep reading until your eyes grow sore.  Despite the title's barbaric nature Fight Club is not a book filled with rage and violence.<br /> The plot itself is also partially mysterious.  It leaves us craving more and more after each page.  As an unnamed narrator travels across the country he runs into a smooth witty soap salesman named Tyler Durden.  Tyler and our narrator go their separate ways.  The main character searching for friends and listeners, attends various cancer support groups.  A different one every night, a hundred people who think he is one of them.  He is a faker, a lonely man looking for companionship.  But when the narrator loses all that he has, he calls Tyler to see if he can stay the night.  Tyler reveals to him an entirely new outlook on life.  A day turns into a week, a week into a month.  Then one night Tyler tells our character to hit him.  He is baffled, but nevertheless hits Tyler.  Tyler hits him back and they fight.  This is the birth of Fight Club.   <br /> I can't reveal more of the plot without spoiling the mysteries.  Fight Club was a great movie and the book is even better.  Don't think that because you've seen the movie you do not need to read the book because you are entirely wrong.  Fight Club is a classic that has instilled a new viewpoint into my life.  It was one of the greatest books I have ever had the pleasure to read.  The school banned this book because it was supposedly inappropriate, and they have made a mistake.  Fight Club will leave a lasting impression on me for a very long time.  I will not easily forget the reasoning of Tyler Durden, the goals of Project Mayhem, or the viewpoint on life I received when reading this book.  So drop down your idealistic defenses and pick up Fight Club.  I guarantee you, that once you put the book down all you'll be able to say is \\"whoa\\". <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Okay, I admit...  I've been a Madonna fan since I was 8 years old and certain albums will always be remembered more than others. Confessions On A Dance Floor is one of those albums.  <br /> <br />This is pure fun. Twelve non-stop tracks blended into one magic album. There really isn't a song to skip this time around. Madonna definitely put together something special. After the seriousness associated with American Life, COAD is the perfect follow up.  <br /> <br />The album starts out with \\"Hung Up\\" which is the first single. It's light, fun and everything you want from Madonna. Great beats and a retro-disco feel. This same feeling makes it's way through the entire album and slows down a bit at the end, just as any night club would do. Stand out tracks for me: Get Together, Future Lovers, Sorry, and Isaac. I'm not saying the other songs aren't good, just these are my personal favorites. Taken as a whole, this very well looks to be the best album by anybody this year.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Having just watched the series on DVD the timing of this movie was perfect for me.  Loved the film and hope there are more or a revival of the series ala Family Guy on Fox.  It was really dumb of them to pull the plug so soon.
B000AY74OG|5.0|MADAGASCAR is a delightful animated film from the makers of SHREK.  Although the leading roles are entertaining and effective, the movie is stolen by the quartet of penguins and the gallery of lemurs.  These guys are what really makes the movie so enjoyable.  The animation is brilliant, and there is some clever in jokes parodying CHARIOTS OF FIRE, PLANET OF THE APES and other movies.  There are some delightful tunes as well.  The main voices are supplied by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith and David Schwimmer, but its those hilarious penguins and lemurs that make the most lasting impression.  The four penguins are like undercover covert operators and the lemurs are just whacky and whimsical.  Little Mort (voiced by Andy Richter) is as Gloria the hippo says, \\"Cute enough to dunk in my coffee.\\"  The movie has a slow start in the zoo setting but once the guys get to Madagascar, its a real hoot.  Children should enjoy the movie; its innuendos and off color humor will more than likely fly fight over their heads, but adults will enjoy this gem as much as the kiddies..I did!!  A marvelous extra is the short film PENGUINS CHRISTMAS CAPER which is a real gas too!
B00005JOGU|5.0|... did I even think about the fact that I was watching a movie actor.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman WAS Truman Capote -- he absolutely nailed the part, he was perfect.  If this performance does not garner a Best Actor Oscar, then the award is meaningless. <br /> <br />And, the storyline nailed Capote perfectly too.  His ruthless tenacity in pursuing the \\"In Cold Blood\\" Kansas murder story was stunning, chilling, sickening, dazzling.  He came across as a writer who would trample his own mother to obtain details for his compositions, crossing every ethical boundary you can name and gleefully making himself a part of the story.  Too, it was obvious he loved celebrity -- and in the end, loved being in the spotlight more than he loved writing.   <br /> <br />This is a great movie... which certainly is not to say you will ever want to see it again, after it has slammed into you once.  But unforgettably stunning it is, that sole time.  Enjoy.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|A much better album than \\"American Life\\" although I felt it wasn't as dancefloor friendly as has been hyped - it's a bit plodding in places. \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Push\\" are great though. \\"Push\\" is old school Madonna, brilliantly sung with great lyrics. \\"Forbidden love\\" is another fave.  <br /> <br />As a Madonna fan since 1983 I have followed her throughout the years, only stumbling when \\"AL\\" came out in 2003. I found both the politics (which really isn't her thing) and the \\"poor me, I wish people understood me\\" ranting a bit too hard to swallow, particularly coming from a multi-millionaire with no real everyday problems. <br /> <br />Whats really missing from this album is one or two more disco house/trance type stomping dancefloor fillers other than \\"Hung up\\". I did think it would be a bit faster - if this was played at a proper club, it would have to be speeded up a bit. Still, it's a much appreciated return to form. Let's hope Madge sticks with this type of thing, it does suit her so well. <br /> <br />Regards.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Yeah... I love singing and dancing while I'm driving too... well, not. But, I do agree that this is a high quality dance album with a good blend of solid lyrics and glittery electronica. Ray of Light indicated this direction and Music built up on it. American Life tried to veer off of the flawless path and it got panned for it... but Confessions returns to the promise of past albums and delivers on sheer fun and style alone but it also helps that the substance is pretty solid as well. \\"Hung Up\\", her lead off single, gets this party started and it doesn't really let up after that. There are a couple mid-tempo tunes but they do nothing to slow the quotent of fun down. The only thing that I don't particulary like about this album is that all the songs flow into the next as if this is a continuously mixed DJ album. Still, it is hard to deny the charm and skill put into this creative offering from one of the music industries leading and argualbly... best chamelions. This Confession is quite a treat.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This one of Madonna's best cd's. Sorry is my favorite song on the album and trust me it's hard to pick one out when they are all so excellent. This dance only cd is a must have for everyone that loves listening to music. I love it!!!
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie was really good. I am not familiar with the comic book this is based on, but I will need to acquiant myself with it, due to this movie. <br /> <br />Sin City had a really good, original and exciting storyline, the direction was good, the acting was fine, and the casting was really good. Perfect. Did I mention Rosario Dawson is/was hot? Sin City is a dark film, hawking back to the days of Film Noir. All the characters were on the wrong side of the tracks, just some more so then others. The movie was also very violent, but that is to be expected I guess.  <br /> <br />I would have to say that I haven't been this impressed with a movies originallity and style, since Pulp Fiction. By the way, one thing to mention. This movie reminds me a little of a book I just read, called \\"Blue Goblins\\", which dealt with an apocalytic future, sex, drugs, violence, and gangs; it was a good book if you like this type of material. <br /> <br />So, to close you have a good,exciting, original styled dark-themed movie; with an excellant cast (with a hot Rosaio Dawson), good direction, and good story. I would strongly recommend this movie!
140003180X|5.0|The remarkable thing about the 'No.1 Ladies Detective Agency' series is that the incredible standard of the books haven't diminished as the series went on. 'The Kalahari Typing School for Men', the fourth book in the series, is as good as the first in the series, and is one of my personal favourites.<br /><br />In this installment of the goings-on in Mma Ramotswe's life in Botswana, the leading lady sets herself the mission of finding her assistant detective, Mma Makutsi, a husband; the agency gets its first taste of competition in the form of a chauvinistic detective who's worked in America; Mma Makutsi sets up a typing school for men and the agency gets a case involving a man who want closure on his troubled past. As always, this latest novel is a successful blend of the personal lives of the main characters, including the heroine, Mma Makutsi, the two apprentices and Mma Ramotswe's long-time fiance Mr J.L.B Matekoni.<br /><br />As always, McCall Smith includes both the detailed descriptions of the incredibly country that is the stage for the story, and gives us a ticket into Mma Ramotswe's mind. In this book, the trend of the series to slowly expand to show the other characters more continues, with Mma Makutsi getting a chance to shine in the spotlight as she sets up her own business. The younger apprentice meanwhile moves away from his promiscuous lifestyle to a more pious one.<br /><br />But, in spite of a slight and temporary spotlight shift to some of the supporting roles, Mma Ramotswe remains queen bee of her small corner of Botswana. The staple of these books remains: Mma Ramotswe's sense of decency and old-school morals which she refuses to bend, and her philosophical outlooks and opinions on everything ensure that this series just keeps going from strength to strength.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie was very well done. The storyline was familiar to anyone who knows a bit about the X-Men comic book, although it didn't faithfully follow any storyline from the comics. It was still familiar. The casting, as in the last X-Men movie was good, Hugh Jackman is a great Wolverine, and Alan Cummings stole the scenes he was in as Nightcrawler. The special effects were very good in this movie, and the directing was also good. <br /> <br />If your in the mood for a light, fun, fast-paced movie; that is part fantasy-part adventure. Then this movie is for you!
B0006L16N8|5.0|After about 18 months in the making, Coldplay released their 3rd album, X&Y.  When I first listened to this album it was the first time I listened to Coldplay.  My spine was frozen after listening to all the tracks.  I was so shocked and new that Coldplay was going to be my favorite band for a long time.  The lyrics are very deep to all songs including Coldplay's American inspired song, \\"Speed of Sound\\", showing how our culture justs moves so fast and how we are just rushing to get things done.  \\"Twisted Logic\\" really makes you think how people and our world will be in the future.  \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" is the catchiest song on the planet and if I could give it a million stars, I would.<br /><br />After going multi-platinum with their 2nd album, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", Coldplay and lead man Chris Martin are sure to go bigger and most certainly win a lot more Grammy's than last time around.<br /><br />Also, \\"Fix You\\" is another track that will have you be singing along and have a jolly good time.  ALL, and I mean ALL tracks can be listened to several times through and I haven't got bored of a song since listening to them since the beginning of July.  The first track, \\"Square One\\", is sure to get you hooked to listening to the other 11 tracks plus the bonus track, \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\", making 13 tracks in all.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying this album and as always, HAPPY LISTENING!!!<br /><br />  -A very big Coldplay fan
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I can't wait to get this.  Just curious...does it have the Sony XCP spyware everyone is up-in-arms about?
B000B7BRMM|1.0|I'm a big Krall fan AND a sucker for X-mas albums, so for me to not like this one is saying something. First the rhythms and arrangements are all just so wrong: forced, inappropriate, not good. Second, no holiday spirit, this feels like an album recorded in the dog days of August. Lastly, this sounds more like Diana doing her impression of Rex Harrison. Hon- try sustaining a note or two here or there, listening to you speak your way through old chestnuts is as dull as dirt. When I pay, I want a singer to SING, call me crazy! Don't waste your time with this one or you'll have a blue christmas, that's certain!
0812550706|5.0|I've read this book oh, 4 times now over several years. With each read, I become completely engrossed and aware of new details and ideas. When anyone asks for a good book I immediately lend them Ender's Game, and every time, they come back with a smile that says, \\"I am Ender.\\"
B000BHHVPO|5.0|the sound its great, the picture quality too!!! and the list of artists are incredible
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|In the five years since 'And Then You'll Beg' the tech metal scene has bloomed to the point of near absurdity with the birth and rise of all things core (see 4/5 of the Willowtip roster). During this time, the once great Crytopsy was nowhere to be found, receiving not close to enough credit for kick starting the tech revolution (Cryptopsy should always be mentioned in the same breath as The Dillinger Escape Plan). With their early albums already being dubbed underground classics and Mike DiSalvo's vocal work (not quite as good, but far more digestible than Lord Worm) they could have become \\"the\\" band. But all of that aside, 'Once Was Not' sees the band perfectly fusing the brutality of 'None So Vile' with the over-the-top tech performances of 'Whisper Supremecy\\", that, along with the return of the god-like Lord Worm, creating what is definitely the tech album of the millennium. There is diversity abound on here, with sounds ranging from straight ahead death metal  (see the raging first 30 seconds of \\"Carrionshine\\") to freeform jazz (see the beyond cool intro to \\"Keeping the Cadaver Dogs Busy\\") to doomy goth (see the November's Doomesqu \\"Pestilence That Walketh in Darkness (Psalm 91: 5-8)\\"), all done convincingly. If you have ever listened to Cryptopsy you know what to expect from the quality of this record; expert musical chops (along with my vote for best percussive performance of the decade) and fantastic vocal / lyrical work (Lord Worm is back and at the top of his game. The aspect of the record which impresses most is the riff after riff after riff of pure ingenuity, some of the most technical and catchiest (?) guitar work I've heard in quite a long time (seriously, \\"Frantic Pace of Dying\\" contains the best riffs of the year). As made clear from the moment this album hits your speakers Once Was Not' is not only a death metal triumph, but also may be the best Crytopsy record yet. Definitely a contender for album of the year.<br /><br />9.5 / 10
B00008YJH5|5.0|I mean, this album is incredible.  I fell in love with it the first time I heard it and it gets better with each listen.  But if you don't own Doolittle, buy that first.  It's the greatest album of all-time.
B00005JL2O|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT!! THE JOKES WERE HILARIOUS, THE CHARACTERS WERE TERRIFIC, AND IT WAS JUST AN ALL OUT EXCELLENT FILM. IT HAS BECOME MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME. <br /> <br />MIKE MYERS(FAT BASTARD, DR. EVIL, GOLDMEMBER, AUSTIN POWERS), PLAYED EACH ROLE QUITE WELL. MYERS DISPLAYS HIS TALENT IN ACTING THROUGH EACH CHARACTER VERY WELL. THE OTHER ACTORS SUCH AS, MICHAEL CAINE(NIGEL POWERS), BEYONCE KNOWLES(FOXY CLEOPATRA), AND VERNE TROYER (MINI-ME), CREATIVELY SUPPORTED MYERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE. <br /> <br />THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN DR. EVIL AND MINI-ME(VERNE TROYER) IS A LAUGH RIOT. THE FILM INTRODUCES NEGLECTFUL DADDY ISSUES, FOR EXAMPLE, AUSTIN'S DADDY (MICHAEL CAINE) ALWAYS INGNORED AUSTIN AND SCOTT EVIL(SETH GREEN) STILL TRYING TO IMPRESS DR.EVIL. <br /> <br />THIS FILM HAS A LOT OF GREAT FUNNY SCENES. FOXY CLEOPATRA, DR. EVIL AND MINI-ME RAPPING, FAT BASTARD SUMO WRESTLING, THE SUBTITLES JOKES, THE FOOK MIE AND FOOK YUO TWINS, AND THE SURPRISE ENDING, TO NAME A FEW. <br /> <br />TO BE HONEST \\"GOLDMEMBER\\" WAS A LOT FUNNIER THAN \\"INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY\\", THE FIRST AUSTIN POWERS MOVIE, BUT EQUALLY AS FUNNY AS \\" THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME\\", THE SECOND AUSTIN POWERS MOVIE. THE JOKES IN \\"INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY\\" HINTED TOWARDS THE GROSS HUMOR, \\"THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME\\" HINTS A LITTLE MORE TOWARDS THE JOKES, BUT \\"GOLDMEMBER\\" TAKES THE JOKES TO THE EXTREME. <br /> <br />I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET SEEN IT. IT IS A GREAT MOVIE TO LAUGH AT WHEN IT IS ONE OF THOSE DAYS.
0385510454|1.0|OK..... I give up.  I have read every Grisham book and maybe its me but his books are just not that good anymore. <br />This last one \\"The Broker\\" was so bad (and I'm not that fuzzy)was beyond believe.  It started out bad and I just kept hoping that it would get better so I stuck with it.  When I finally got to the end I became fully convinced that this may be my last Grisham book to read.  I just can't keep punishing myself thinking that Grisham's writings will improve. <br />(Sorry John.....)
B000B8QF00|4.0|There are some who may still think of \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" as her \\"Greatest Hits\\", and while it is an amazing album, there has been so much good music since. I find this to be a great sampling of her hits, as well as the best of her lesser known songs. Obviously we get the goods from \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", and those five should be here no doubt. However this also includes the great tracks \\"Thank You\\", \\"Hands Clean\\", \\"Simple Together\\", and the recent hit \\"Everything\\". Plus we get the haunting \\"Uninvited\\" from the \\"City Of Angels\\" soundtrack, and songs from the films \\"Dogma\\" and \\"De-Lovely\\". Toss on a cover of \\"Crazy\\" and that makes this an excellent disc. In a perfect world this might also have \\"All I Really Want\\" and \\"Right Thru You\\", but despite that it's still quite \\"The Collection\\".
B000AMWIVM|5.0|for the people who gave one star for this movie: <br />stop wining like a dog, what is wrong with u people? <br />this was a great movie and deserves every star.so if u like pshycologic horror movies ,defenetly buy it!
0807126063|2.0|To be sure, we all have different tastes and opinions.  For all the rave reviews I read prior to picking up this book, I feel like I'm missing something.  As the title to this review suggests, I'm reminded of those 3D prints that became so popular during the 90s.  I never saw the object back then and I don't see the humor and brilliance of this book now. <br /> <br />Take this with a grain of salt as I threw in the towel after 100 pages.  I just couldn't convince myself to press on in hopes that somehow Toole was weeding out the unenthusiastic readers through the first 5 chapters with hilarity to ensue for the remainder of the book.   <br /> <br />While Ignatius Reilly is a humorous and wholly original character, I found the book to be more bizarre and absurd than funny.  In my opinion, a comedy should make you laugh out loud which this did not. <br /> <br />Clearly a great many people love this book and find it hilarious.  I'll count myself in the minority and pick up some Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiassen the next time I want to laugh while reading.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"American Life\\" was Madonna's worst selling album because it was too bogged down in its slow-ish folktronica. Madonna had--for the most part--abandoned her dance roots for a more personal collection of songs. Also, the timing was bad due to the impending Iraq War for which she pulled the title track's political video.  <br /> <br />\\"Confessions\\" returns Madge to her sweet spot on the dance floor. The record flows from beginning to end with charged up beats and catchy choruses. After my 4th listen, the songs are stuck in my head, especially the 3rd track, \\"Sorry.\\"  <br /> <br />Usually, Madonna's records have a few clunkers on them which always keep my expectations limited: quirky experiments that fall short of other tracks. This is not the case here. All the songs seem to have a stable, consistent quality about them in some ways like on \\"Ray of Light.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, Madonna's new record is excellent and fun. Everything seems to have come together for this collaboration with Stuart Price. The major media also seems to dig her new grooves, giving her mostly positive reviews. If you like upbeat, catchy dance music, go out and get this album now!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's new CD is both retro sounding and futuristic at the same time. Disco meets electronica! She says she was giving a nudge and a wink to the Bee Gees and Giorgio Moroder, the latter clearly evident on the track 'Future lovers' which is very similar in feel to the Donna Summer smash 'I feel love' (though uncredited on the CD).<br /><br />Opening track and lead off single 'Hung up' is a deliriously catchy dance track sampling the piano riff off ABBA's 'Gimme gimme gimme (a man after midnight)'. It features muffled and warped sounding bassline and beats in some places. Presently a huge hit in the UK (#1 and I've been hearing it a lot everywhere I go in London & Nottingham the past few weeks), the album should follow suit next Monday.<br /><br />'Sorry', slated to be the follow up single is a poppy/dance affair, which features an uncredited riff from the Jackson's hit 'Can you feel it'. It starts off with Madonna muttering 'I'm sorry' in French, Spanish, Italian, and a few other languages against an eerie, hymnal backdrop, before exploding into the catchy upbeat tune it is.<br /><br />The midtempo plodding haunting eurodisco tune 'Forbidden love' (with breathy vocals, this is the closest thing to a ballad on the CD) sounds like something Kylie would do, of course we all know Kylie learned quite a few tricks from her 'Madgesty' (LOL!!).<br /><br />'I love New York' was one of 5 songs she performed November 15 at London's Koko club. With lyrics like \\"I don't like cities/But I like New York/Other places make me feel like a dork/Los Angeles is for people who sleep/Paris and London, baby you can keep\\", she was heckled initially when the song was introduced, till she explained that the song is not really about the city, but the NY state of mind, she learned how to survive in NY she said, and she loves London or she wouldn't live there. This earned her wild applause and she then launched into the jerky dance track with cold as glass delivery.<br /><br />Standouts to me are the retro/urban techno feel of 'Get together' (very funky dance song), 'Jump' (which should get clubbers to do just that), 'How high' (with lyrics about the pitfalls of stardom), 'Isaac' with religious sounding lyrics featuring some Hebrew chanting a-la Ofra Haza, set to a dizzying synth back drop, and 'Push' which features what sounds like deep African percussion played on a synthesizer, and lyrics about someone pushing her to be better. Guy maybe?? Hmm. Brilliant!!<br /><br />Closing track 'Like it or not' features dizzying synths and acoustic guitar, and lyrics telling us 'This is who I am/like it or not'.<br /><br />The whole CD has a very European sound to it, with all 12 tracks segueing seamlessly into each other. The songs are upbeat and catchy, and some feature deeper lyrics than you'd expect. Unlike a lot of people, I loved 'American life' and despite feeling this was a retreat caused by the stinging criticism that CD received, I love this too, and hopefully, this will attain the commercial success that the former couldn't.together' (very funky dance song), 'Jump' (which should get clubbers to do just that), 'How high' (with lyrics about the pitfalls of stardom), 'Isaac' with religious sounding lyrics featuring some Hebrew chanting a-la Ofra Haza, set to a dizzying synth back drop, and 'Push' which features what sounds like deep African percussion played on a synthesizer, and lyrics about someone pushing her to be better.

B000B8QEZG|3.0|This album sounds like the last three Kylie Minogue discs without any infectious singles.  It's good to clean the house to but, doesn't make me want to dance.
B000088E6D|5.0|I heard this cd playing in the background in a store last year and snapped it up.  Since that time, it has rarely left my cd player.  Mr. Buble refreshes many standards, and adds some polish and enthusiasm to the newer songs he covers(George Michael's \\"Kissing a Fool\\" and Queen's \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\"). All in all, it is an outstanding effort.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Though there are awful reviews on this page about Madonna being pop queen and that she's better from Mimi. I think while you're criticizin' Mariah you should be supportin' Madonna's single instead of tryin' to diss Mariah. That never worked before. <br />Now, this is the re-released of multi-platiniun Mariah Carey late album that came out on 2005 and keep strong on Billboard Hot 200 Top 20. The album has already 6 chart singles: It's Like That, We Belong Together, Get Your Number, Mine Again, Shake It Off and Gospel's Fly Like A Bird. Though only 3 were official singles and promted in US, the album is amazing through all the comments in this review pages. <br /> <br />She re-released as 50 Cents and The Killers did to her album to sell more records while they can...not many artist have the change to sell like these artist.  <br /> <br />This album has 4 new tracks, the single Don't Forget About Us which is an amazing and made to Top 20 on Billboard Hot 100. r&b HOOK UP on Makin' It Last All Night and Mariah beats off Twista on So Lonely on a new versions includin' Mariah's new verse. Then comes the remix of We Belong Together. Apart of 4 videos includin' and the special link to get into High Quality Don't Forget About Us video.  <br /> <br />I recommend of this to those who are really fan. If you don't like to buy this you should download Don't Forget About Us when is already out.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I absolutely love these three new tracks and the remix of We Belong Together.  So Lonely w/ Twista... Making It Last All Night, w/ JD... and Don't Forget About Us, w/ JD are GREAT.  The beats on So Lonely and Making it Last all Night are absolutely banging!!!  I LOVE THESE NEW TRACKS!!!  The remixed track of We Belong Together, is also an amazing remix and I am glad it is now available on the re-release.<br /><br />I don't know why people are saying that this is the 3rd time Mariah is re-releasing this album.  The Emancipation of Mimi has ONLY been out for 29 weeks.  It has been in the TOP FIVE for 22 weeks of those 29 weeks and it is evident that it only started slipping when word of the re-release got out.<br /><br />During The Emancipation of Mimi's 22 week span in the top five, it shot back to NUMBER ONE in its 8th week.  Mimi has gone on to sell 4 million copies, which already made Mariah TONS of money, so she is by far NOT money hungry.  Mariah re-released three new tracks and a remix unavailable on the first album release.  KEEP IN MIND the guidelines for a re-release are only FOUR new tracks.<br /><br />So HATERS hate on...go somewhere else with your negativity!  This album is amazing and I am so fortunate that Mariah added four new tracks, that I like better than any of the original tracks on MIMI!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Than to run your mouth, remove all doubt, *and* be locked up in a seedy back-alley dungeon, imprisoned for no reason, with no explanation, by an implacable, mysterious, shadowy foe, entirely bent on your destruction and insanity.<br /><br />Such is the fate of our hero Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi, in the role of a lifetime): a buffoon, a drunken Korean businessman loaded up on too much booze and a night of excess, busted by the police, booked into jail, urinating in a corner of the police station, barely bailed to freedom by his old friend Joo-hwan---and who, seconds later, on a busy Seoul thoroughfare, outside a phone booth, minutes away from his wife and infant daughter---disappears.<br /><br />Without a trace.<br /><br />Without a trace to his family and friends, perhaps---but certainly not to his tormentors. For Oh Dae-Su awakes in confinement, in what appears to be a seedy flat in a seedier tenement, confined, imprisoned, given no answers, provided food and water, and gassed each night for the Cleaners to make---ahem---'adjustments'.<br /><br />It's enough to drive a sober man stark-raving mad, don't you think?<br /><br />It's even worse that Dae-su, entombed as he is in the guts of the City, cut off from any explanation---why is he here? when can he get out? who has done this? My God, jailer, won't you talk to me?---panicked, hopeless, desolate---is nonetheless in contact with the outside world: through television.<br /><br />Call it his book of days. He sees the days stretch into months, the months stretch into years. He hears the news report of the atrocious, brutal murder of his wife, her throat slashed at the hands of a shadowy brute, his infant daughter whisked away into the protective clutches of anonymous Officialdom.<br /><br />A happy man, one instant: a Prisoner, the next.<br /><br />Years pass, and then the greatest trick of all: Dae-Su is released. Sprung. Baptized atop an office tower, sprung from the womb of an oversized suitcase, left to find his own way, bereft of family, life, place: suspected as the murderer of his wife, years ago. A Man without a face, without a name, without a country. With one thing, and one thing only: Revenge.<br /><br />Oh, and a cell phone, and a wallet full of money, passed to him by a nameless beggar who claims to know nothing: hungry, tired, dispirited, Dae-Su tears through a pack of thugs---all that karate +-practice in his lounge-lizard-prison having paid off handsomely, evidently---checks into a juke-jive, bites the head off a squirming, hapless octopus, and meets a sweet young thing---Mi-Do---who is instantly horrified, and compelled.<br /><br />And then the real fun begins.<br /><br />Now: it would be unfair to say much more about \\"Oldboy\\". It is a stark, searing little testament to the power of guerilla filmmaking, a laurel wrapped about the head of its creator, Chun-Wook Park, who has managed to graft high style with a weird kind of cinematic poetry, an elegiac cinematographic high style, married to a sere, haunting, neo-classical soundtrack (with snippets of Vivaldi): all of it builds up to a crescendo that is nothing short of catharsis. It's an exhausting film: it makes demands.<br /><br />The cinematography is its own character here, as is the direction: there is a kind of wild elegance, in the rain-swept streets of Seoul, of the spare interiors, of the weary, craggy, hell-beaten topography of its hero's face, seamed with bewilderment and agony. The battle sequences---there are a number---are kinetic, yes, but for all the high style, feel real: you can feel the skin buckling, the bruises forming up purple-yellow, the sullen exhaustion of the combatants.<br /><br />And beyond and above it all is the central question: what is Vengeance? Who is the Avenger, and what is avenged? The acting---from Choi to Hye-Jeon Kang (Mi-Do), and all the supports---is supple, and completely compelling, adding to the grandeur of this shivery little tale of grue and moral kurare: ultimately the big reveal is more devastating for its precision---its preciseness, its measured planning---than anything you might have expected.<br /><br />Brace yourself.<br /><br />JSGf grue and moral kurare: ultimately the big reveal is more devastating for its precision---its preciseness, its measured planning---than anything you might have expected.  <br /> <br />Brace yourself. <br /> <br />JSG
B000002J2B|5.0|Their first album without Peter Gabriel. His is certainly missed but this album is one of their best. Well written and musically as good as anything they had done to that point. I am a huge Steve Hackett fan and he really stands out on this one. \\"A Fifth Of Firth\\" is a nice showcase for him. As far as a story goes \\"One For The Vine\\" is very clever as it tells of a person who goes from running from a tyrant to becoming the very tyrant he was running from. Love it!
B00004U2GH|4.0|Like FOLSOM before it, AT SAN QUENTIN captures Cash and his band playing live before about 1,000 rowdy and emotional inmates, feeding off their energy to create another memorable performance. There is a bit of a staged feeling to this one that I didn't find in AT FOLSOM PRISON; the song selection focusing on prison life and gospel music, with a double shot of the song \\"San Quentin\\" that made the prisoners happy but felt a bit forced to me. But there are many highlights here as Cash's energy continues to build from his take on Shel Silerstein's \\"A Boy Named Sue,\\" that became a novelty hit for Cash, to the wild \\"The Old Account was Settled Long Ago\\" where everyone gets into the act and closing with a hard driving medley of hits that ends the concert at full tilt. While it lacks the immediacy of AT FOLSOM PRISON, AT SAN QUENTIN serves as a valuable companion piece and a reminder of the power this man had over an audience.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I, too, bought the DVD set on a lark. I noticed that it was one of the top-rated Sci-Fi DVD sets and I had never heard of it. I was looking for some new material and purchasing the set was not a mistake.  After a couple of episodes I was hooked. The characters are unique, the scripts are awsome. <br /> <br />I saw Serenity (the FireFly movie)the day it came out. I've already pre-ordered the DVD. I hope there is a sequel in the making!  It is really ashame the series didn't last, but I had never heard any advertising about it during the time it was on. (I'm not a Buffy or Angel fan and didn't know who Joss Wheadon was before FireFly).
0446577383|5.0|I read this book from the first line until the last in one day.  I was enamored.  I have read all of his books and find he is clearly one of the most amazing and talented authors out there today.  The plot is riveting.  You feel for the characters (good and bad), and hang in there until the end to a brilliant conclusion.  My only regret was that this book had to end at all.  Very highly recommended.
B00004I9VE|5.0|This is a great SACD. I now own this recording on vinyl,CD and now SACD. I compared this SACD to the original CD recording, and I was blown away!! Don't get me wrong, the CD sounds great, but the SACD takes the music to another level. You'll hear things in the music that you'd never heard before. The whole cd just comes to life in this format. I really wish that this technology becomes more widely embraced by the public. It really will change the way we listen to music. The highs are so clear. The music just sounds so much warmer! Not as antiseptic as regular CD's. Just give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I purchased this CD yesterday and it's excellent. I bought the original one back in April, but I've been anticipating this re-release for awhile. The 4 new tracks \\"Don't Forget About Us,\\" \\"Makin' It Last All Night,\\" \\"So Lonely\\", and \\"We Belong Together (Remix),\\" are all excellent. They sound great on the CD. And the DVD is awesome. No cheap presentation, only the best for Mariah. The videos look terrific. You can either view them continuously or individually. The DVD menus look really nice also. This is a superb package all around.  <br /> <br />This CD plays like a greatest hits album. Amazing!!! :-)
B000B8QF14|3.0|I felt so much energy when the concert started, but the in between interviews just did not allowed me to enjoy the concert. <br />Audio sound is good , and the band is tight in this concert.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Anyone who listens to this and doesn't give it 5 stars isn't a Madonna fan--never has been and never will be.    This CD is incredible and it's EXACTLY what most of us have wanted for years.    Madonna's remixed singles have always been better than her radio edits, so this record skips all that radio edit stuff and goes straight to the remixes!    It's the best ever--watch it grow on the skeptics.
B0000057C5|4.0|This really is a nice piece of work, good music, 'funny' lyrics, but unfortunately we seem to have the same problem as with Mutter, all the songs are lookalikes. Listen to them, It really gets bored after 5 or 6 songs, I prefer metal from the eighties like Iron Maiden and Dio, because they have better guitar solo's and more variation in the songs. But enough negativity, when you listen it in steps, you'll love it, the best songs are Sehnsucht, Tier, Du Hast and Spiel Mit Mir. The worst is Bestrafe Mich. And the rest is also good.<br />Keep On Rocking!
B000AQBA1W|5.0|The Corrs is one of the few bands on the pop music side that I love. This is why it pains me so much that my first review for The Corrs for Amazon was rated 2 stars for their Borrowed Heaven album. My parting words in that review was \\"But I really hope and pray the next album would be in the league of their former albums.\\"  This new album is for me is an answer from heaven. This new album Home exceeded beyond my expectations. This is a great album and for me this even better than some of their old albums. Now this album was made by the Corrs for their \\"true fans\\" who know their roots.  The album is made up of songs that are based on their IRISH traditions.  This album is so rooted in their tradition that two songs Buachaill On Eirne\\" and \\"Brid Og Ni Mhaille\\" are sang in gaelic (I live this so much). My favorite tracks of this album are Old Hag and Haste to a Wedding (this instrumental piece that is often played in their live shows). The violin, tin whistle, and bohran solos in this album is well weaved to the album. I think this album is not for everybody as this is not a commercial album. I hope and pray this album becomes a commercial success so that Artist like the Corrs would not compromise their creativity for money in the future. This album is truly a Corrs  masterpiece.
B000002UB3|5.0|My favorite album of all time and one of only a few albums that can still geve me the chills even after listening to it so many times.  The first side is spectacular, but the second side has all its songs so perfectly interwined that it knocks even the first side out of the water.  None of the songs on the second side are all that amazing when listening to them individually, but when they are listened to in context... mmm mmm mmm pure magic!  Come Together, Something, Here Comes the Sun, I Want You (She's So Heavy)...  any modern day band would kill to have just ONE of these songs on their new album, but the Beatles stuck all four of them on one album.  A Work of Art.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is the Batman film fans have been waiting for, Chris Nolan and David Goyer have truely brought Batman back from the dead with this cinematic masterpiece. Exploring the true origins of Bruce Wayne and his journey in becoming the Legendary icon known as The Batman. Solid casting has played a huge part of this film from the brilliant casting of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, no one has embraced the character quite like this before. Michael Caine is great as Alfred, along with Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordan and Morgan Freeman as Lucuis Fox. Liam Neeson brillant as always and Cillian Murphy makes a truelly creepy and psychotic villian as Scarecrow. The film goes into great detail to explain why Bruce Wayne would dress up like a Bat and also how he ends up with his infamous gadets. The new Batmobile or Tumbler as it's also know as makes all previous Batmobiles look like toys compared to this thing, the chase scence is breathtaking. The film's only weak point is Katie Holmes and her unconvincing performance as an assistant D.A and love interest Rachel(the role should be recast with someone who can act). Fans and general moviegoers should throughly enjoy this movie. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Not like anyone cares what these critics like or don't like (they hate it when the public don't go with what they decree good or bad), but Coldplay has done it again, proving they're at the top of their game with their third album \\"X&Y.\\"<br /><br />While the finer points of the CD can be found elsewhere on this page, one thing is obvious and that Coldplay's critics show their immaturity time and again with their criticisms of the band simply because they're not another in a long line of record company creations that raps over a drum machine or ditzy blondes billed as singers and who are anything but.<br /><br />Coldplay can (horrors!) read and write music and compose lyrics that aren't calling women every derogatory name out there.  And, to further complicate things, Chris Martin and Company actually act their ages.  Unlike the plethora of overrated garage bands shoved down our throats every hour by corporate American radio, they're not grown men in their 20's or 30's still getting their teeth knocked out in barroom brawls and have a different mother for every kid they have.  They also don't make a career out of blatantly, and unapologetically, ripping off legendary bands' music.<br /><br />Too many people today have absolutely no standards when it comes to music.  They try to convince themselves they're above the corporate hype of the crop of overrated and overexposed \\"singers\\" and groups - who are nothing more than record company creations and American Idol rejects.  When an original band such as Coldplay comes along, they find everything under the sun wrong with them.  \\"Twisted Logic,\\" indeed.<br /><br />When you think of the underwhelming alternatives (alleged actresses doubling for singers), singers who don't write their material nor can sing, Coldplay is quite refreshing.
B0007GAEGC|3.0|Truth be known my original intent upon purchasing \\" Celtic Woman \\" was as a gift for my wife. Although I'm half Irish I have found that the closest thing that can be found in my ever-expanding compact disc collection when it comes to Celtic music is Van Morrison. I enjoy some of the genre but overall my taste tends to run fairly old-fashioned. My wife, on the other hand, immediately embraced it and I have had the (mis)fortune to hear this cd often. That being the case my review, though some may view as harsh, is warranted seeing how I've certainly 'earned' the right by my, what can only be considered, intimate knowledge of \\" Celtic Woman. \\"     First off obviously the five attractive women who grace the cover of this offering are talented. Now, I'm not talking immensely so and I suspect that some of them may have been chosen for this project partly on their looks. Nevertheless, they do seem to hold their own and granted while not much is asked of them here they do admirably well. Kind of like Il Divo for the New Age set! Anyway, for me at least, the disc while possessing a certain atmospheric quality about it does tend to meander and I found myself after the first four selections wondering if they might'n pick up the pace just a little as I was beginning to drift off myself. Most of the tracks to be found here are generally very moody, light as a feather and tend to drift ever so slightly. There really isn't a whole lot here when it comes to anything slightly resembling a pulse and God knows the last thing this world might need is yet another version of \\" Danny Boy. \\" Celtic Woman tends to stay on the straight and narrow when it comes to song selection and no doubt many of the tracks here you have undoubtedly heard on may previous cd's. Whether it be Clannad's \\" Harry's Game \\" yet another rendition of \\" Ave Maria \\" ( which was sorely lacking any emotion )  or even Josh Grobans \\" You Raise Me Up \\" ( complete schlock, this one! ) most of these selections have been performed by many artists and while this group of five do them justice they, sadly, offer little else. \\"Nella Fantasia \\" being a case in point. I have, to date, 6 versions of this chestnut and the rendition to be found here is probably the weakest of the bunch. And whats with the Kenny G. styled solo in the middle?  Anyway, sadly the only time the group shows any real muscle is near the end of the disc with fiddle player Mairead playing up a fire on \\" The Butterfly \\" but it quickly resorts back to its original 'Celtic tunes ala Smooth Jazz' stylings. I will state that \\" Someday \\" the Disney track from \\" Hunchback of Notre Dame \\" was very pretty and inviting but that simply wasn't enough to save this cd from becoming somewhat uninspiring and not as adventurous as I had hoped.    Heres where I get slammed. First, I do understand that a disc such as this is probably geared toward those of us who have a casual interest in Celtic music but know, and perhaps even understand, very little of the genre. I suspect that this was released as a sort of 'Celtic light ' for those who tend to view this as somewhat exotic and are eager to bath in the Celtic experience but don't wish to jump in the deep end of the music pool. Obviously word of mouth about this project came from a special airing on PBS and while that cetainly isn't a 'bad thing' it does tend to lend one to believe that this was an offering that was put togther with the cheese and wine set in mind. The song listing just seems far too calculated and safe for me to think anything else. I've no doubt this disc is hugely popular with suburban/soccer mom's everywhere and while that is damning \\"Celtic Woman\\" with faint praise I guess theres no harm in the overall project. Granted there is an ordor of a certain overly-marketed, opportunistic aroma that permeates this cd but I guess it beats listening to Rap music. My issue originates from the fact that there is little here that is even remotely emotionally charged and nothing that had me reaching for my stereo's repeat switch. For a style of music that is known for being soul-inspiring, for being emotionally fullfilling and for making us want to roll back the rug and dance with abandon this disc is way off the mark. Its performed admirably but comes across as far too precious and calculated. Nice but it has all the qualities of holding a rather lukewarm Guinness light in your hand.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I think this album is great, full of fun dance oriented songs.  I've been fan for over 20 years its good to have our old friend Madonna back
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This is just awesome... Finally, we have one of the historic, electrifying, pulse pounding live shows on an officially released DVD! The CD sounds great as well. As a lifelong Springsteen fan, this is an absolute dream come true... Just a side note- I agree that Darkness should be next... That album would sound fantastic if it was cleaned up like this... If by chance anyone from Sony is reading this, I offer the following- if you clean 'em up, I'll buy 'em all.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|What can i say? <br /> <br />Love it from start to finish.....seamless.....and pumping. <br /> <br />This is MADONNA showing everyone how it's done. <br /> <br />
B000024D4R|5.0|I am your basic Rock and Roll music fan. I mostly like classic 70's rock, but lean towards progressive, symphonic/art rock such as Floyd, Yes, Rush, etc.  \\"The Wall\\" came out during my High School years and was firmly cemented in my brain from the many hours of play-time it recieved in my car stereo. As I bought earlier works by Floyd (everybody's got Dark Side) I discovered \\"Animals\\".  What a gem!  I really like it. To me it rates right up there with their best.  Highly recomended to other \\"prog-rock\\" fans.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|ok, i have a couple things to say... first of all, this album is VERY enjoyable. and as a long time madonna fan, this is the first time i've enjoyed one of her albums from begining to end. without skipping any songs. \\"hung up\\" is awesome, as everyone already knows. but \\"sorry\\" blew me away. that is going to be a BIG single. <br /> <br />i always thought madonna wasnt given enough credit for her songwriting. her lyrics have been under appreciated for a long time. but now that she has an album with songs that are not that deep lyrically, everyone's on her ass about her lyrics not being strong enough. well, at least thats what ive read here in some of these reviews. people are just being hypocrites. <br /> <br />although we've all enjoyed her remixes in the past, we have all wanted another madonna dance album. like her first album was a dance album for those times-1983, this album is a dance album for today-2005. <br /> <br />i think it's a safe bet to say that if any other artist (not as well known)released an album like this, it would get lost in the shuffle. and thats mostly because here in america dance music is not mainstream. but of course this is madonna and everyone will hear this cd. and thats very good, because now maybe people will appreciate dance music more. <br /> <br />since ray of light i've loved madonna more than ever. including american life. i loved that album. this woman is a genious. thanx madonna for sticking around. <br /> <br />the entire album is excellent, theres no need to break it down. just buy it. you'll love it.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|John Williams, Hans Zimmer, James Horner, and now.....John Debney. Yes, with his extremely out-of-the blue score for The Passion of the Christ, Debney has risen to legendary status in movie music history. Not only was his score the best music of 2004 and only lost to Finding Neverland's because the Oscars didn't want to stir up controversy at their awards, but The Passion of the Christ's music is some of the most powerful and emotional music ever created. From beginning to end, there is never one dull spot on this soundtrack. Even Williams (movie music's greatest composers) has some boring songs on many of his soundtracks. But John Debney keeps the listener enthralled with a wide variety of instruments and a commanding, dramatic choir. Each song is different from the other, instantly destroying the chances of the regular monotony found in most every soundtrack. Below I have created the list of songs and each one's ratings.   1) The Olive Garden: B An excellent introduction to this film. Very mysterious. But, as I said, it's only the introduction     2) Bearing the Cross: A Drums and ethnic music fill this song and when the chorus comes in this song becomes indescribable in terms of emotions.     3) Jesus is Arrested: B Another dramatic song...chorus again uplifts it into greatness     4) Peter Denies Jesus: A Judging by this song's title, it obviously should be very dramatic. Debney delivers just that.     5)The Stoning: B+ An interesting combination of chorus and women soloist. Many emotions are stirred.     6)Song of Complaint: B- Possibly the worst song on the soundtrack but in no way is that saying anything bad about it. This song needs to be in this soundtrack for a \\"cool down\\" from the drama. Wind instruments used.     7) Simon is Dismissed: B+ I call this song the \\"Song of the Devil\\" because of its use in the film and it sounds exactly like a swarm of annoying insects never leaving the listener alone.     8) Flagellation/ Dark Choir/ Disciples: B+ One of themost emotional songs of the soundtrack. The title tells it all.     9) Mary Goes to Jesus: A This song starts of peaceful and then soars with the help of violins and chorus.     10)Peaceful But Primitive: A- Very good song leading up to best song on soundtrack     11) Crucifixion: A+ Best movie music song of the year. Powerful.     12) Raising the Cross: A Dramatic follow up to Crucifixion...Chorus does not disappoint once again.     13)It is Done: B- I changed my mind since this also could go into the category of worst song on soundtrack. But again it's greatly needed to \\"cool down\\" listener and their emotions.     14) Jesus is Carried Down: A If the listener has seen this film they know that Jesus being carried down from the cross isn't the only thing going on in this scene. One listen and it's an easy guess. No, not a stampede.+     15)Resurrection: A+ Only loses out to Crucifixion for best song of the year because of its lackluster finale. But still, the chorus and drums used in this song can inspire the listener. This song gets the award of Most Likely to Make the Listener Cry.
0553801503|3.0|It's doubtful that any sort of review will stop someone who has read the first three books from reading this long-awaited and justly anticipated instalment. Nevertheless, I'd like to voice an opinion which falls between the extremes which seem to be the most prevalent sort of reponses to this book.<br /><br />Mr Martin is a great fantasy writer, and I don't think that has changed. However, A Feast For Crows is not up to the standard of this first three in the series. What I suspect HAS changed is the commercial pressure that has been placed on Mr Martin, combined with (I hate to say it) a growing over-indulgence which has been allowed him. When George Martin defends the delays, longer-than-expected lengths, and the seemingly extraneous side-stories, he is fond of referring to Tolkien by saying that \\"the story writes itself\\" (or something like that). I don't doubt that Martin experiences this \\"divine inspiration\\" like many other great artists, but this time around he seems to have been unable (or more likely, unwilling) to step away from that feeling to undergo the painful process of editing. When the pressure to make a release led to a cutting in half of the anticipated book, thus allowing two books of about 700 pages rather than one of about, say, 1000, it seems that Martin took it as a cue to go easy on the editing. The splitting of the book is itself substantially detrimental, but Martins lack of self-criticism is the real reason why this book is somewhat disappointing. Not everything created by the divine inspiration of great artists is great art.<br /><br />People who are claiming that there is no plot development, either within the book or for the series, are of course exaggerating. There are certain interesting revelations and developments that will no doubt play a role in the eventual (and I say that optimistically) resolution of the series. Take for (spoiler-free) example the potential rise of the Church of the 7 gods as a major political player, the implied motivations of the masters in Oldtown, the (loss of) direction that Berric Dondarions outlaws have taken, the grand plans of the new king of the Iron Islands etc. However, these sort of developments are only seen accidentally through the characters, who have become the real focus of this book.<br /><br />This is where Martin seems to have gone astray. The chapters of the three characters who by far dominate this book in terms of length (Cersei, Jaime, and Brienne) are all in turn overly-dominated by a personal theme. Cersei has become paranoid to the point of insanity, particularly with regards to a prophesy she was given as a girl (which, by the way, felt like a new idea of Martins specifically for this book, but doesn't seem to fit entirely comfortably with Cersei's character from the previous books). Jaime is torn between love/trust and hate/mistrust of his sister. Brienne struggles with doubt about her worth in playing the role of a knight as opposed to an ordinary, though ugly, high-born maiden. The problem is that not only are the bigger events of the \\"game of thrones\\" made subordinate to these longwinded inner struggles and dialogues, but that they tend not to go anywhere. Admittedly Cersei's paranoia has important ramifications in her final 2 chapters, but is it really necessary to spend her first 8 chapters or so just to give the sense of her paranoia? I feel it could have been done in 3 or 4 chapters, and thereby made more engaging rather than tiresome. The same applies at least as much for Jaime and Brienne.<br /><br />Speaking of Brienne, I think that Martin has blatently sacrificed the flow of the story within and between books in favour of setting up a \\"cliffhanger\\" ending. In the previous books, anticipation for the following book has been achieved by a partial resolution of the characters (Jon Snowe becomes Lord Commander and refuses Stannis' offer, Tyrion kills Tywin and leaves Westeros, etc) and leaves you able to intelligently speculate about their future. Brienne's predicament at the end of her final chapter is a matter that would be resolved in a matter of seconds in real-time, but unfortunately Martin has opted to finish it like a lame soap opera full of cheap tricks to make me watch the next episode, or a typical horror movie setting itself up for a money-making sequel. I dare say she will survive, but I am still left feeling a little more cautious of Martins artistic credibility.<br /><br />When I say that those three characters dominate the length of the novel, I am not exaggerating. The rest of the POVS are a mixed bag. I thought that the ones covering Dorne and the Iron Islands contained some interesting developments, although they are yet to take on their full significance, which makes them less engaging. I felt Arya had potential to become one of the more interesting characters at the end of the previous novel, but so far (in her 3 chapters) has failed to deliver. Her primary role here seems to be to describe life in the city of Braavos. Sansa's chapters are somewhat interesting but still contain a lot of filler (especially her last one, which I barely skim read up to the last page, something I never felt inclined to do in any of the prevous books). The same goes for Samwell.<br /><br />Essentially, AFFC contains writing that is as good as any of the previous books, but it is hidden and scattered between too many words, which costs us readers more of our time and money. Martin just seems to do a little too much taking and not enough giving in this instalment, and if things continue like this in the next instalment, he will lose my interest. I'm sure he is aware of the dangers of prolonging a story to the point of tedium. Let's hope that feedback to this book will make him raise his editing game, and get this song back into a refined composition rather than a noodling free-jam.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I just downloaded my pre-order of Confessions on a Dance Floor from iTunes and after the first spin I have to say, \\"Oh My God. Madonna is back!\\"<br /><br />This is the sound that will recapture Madonna's older base and acquire new fans for this perennial diva. It's unbelievably catchy and original. Sonically, it's overly digitized 70's sound with some electronica thrown in for ethereal accent. Lyrically, it's as mature as Ray of Light and as seductive as Erotica with a hint of rebellion a la Like a Prayer. Production is perfect and Madonna sounds like she's at the top of her game (as always).<br /><br />Definitely recommended for Madonna fans (duh!) and dance music junkies out there. It's the catchiest album of 2005 hands down!
B000BO0LLS|4.0|Why are people saying there are four remixes on the CD? Have you even listened to the re-released? It has the original 14 tracks, plus ONE remix- \\"We Belong Together\\"! The others are \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"So Lonely\\" and \\"Makin It Last All Night.\\"  <br /> <br />I loved this CD the first time it came out, and I love this version even more because of the DVD. The interview is HILARIOUS and we get to see a side of Mariah we never did before. I stood in a line for a total of 16 hours in the past two days to meet her, and it was absolutely worth it. She was amazing, as is the re-release! Madonna fans, don't clutter the reviews up with your inaccurate rantings. If you have something to say about the music, then say it. Don't come in here to promote Madonna- do it on her own CD's review.
B0007GAERG|3.0|This CD is not as bad as some people suggest although it does fall short of a masterpiece... I give it three stars because I love all the songs on this album in which Mariah is collaborating with other artists, aside from that the rest of the CD falls absolutely flat.... Best songs: \\"It's like that\\", \\"Get Your Number\\" and \\"One and Only\\"....one exception is \\"We Belong Together\\"; she comes off pretty well on that one (without anyone's help) but that's it....hopefully next time she will come out with a more satisfactory album.....
B000B8QEZG|1.0|The whole album sounds like one only song, just like all the \\"New music\\" I like the \\"ABBA\\" song and wish i bought the single only, I got bored, isnt an album that i would play in my car till the end, sure will/is a hit on the dancefloor.
B0006FO8RA|2.0|Yes this CD includes some signature Britney songs: \\"baby one more time\\", \\"oops i did it again\\", \\"stronger\\", \\"i'm a slave 4 u\\", and \\"toxic\\".... but apart from that it is VERY premature.....Number one she has only been around for 5 years when this album was released....number two she is not a very original artist; she doesn't write much of her music, when she does it is rather juvenile and embarassing....number three she tries to portray herself as the Madonna of the new generation (let's face it, whatever you might think of Madonna, at least she is ambitious, intelligent and original)....by default she does not resemble Madonna in any of those regards..... number four she is missing some songs in this compilation which were actually much more original and mature then, let's say: \\"boys\\", \\"outrageous\\" or \\"do something\\" and those are \\"don't let me be the last to know\\", \\"born to make you happy\\" and \\"from the bottom of my broken heart\\". As you can see, although this album does work in presenting a collage of Britney's beginnings, it fails in presenting her as a very serious singer worthy of the rewards and respect that come with a greatest hits artist...... nice try but TOO EARLY!!!!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin, Gavin, Gavin. He is quite a talent. His songs are meaningful and the lyrics are quite creative. I don't think his lrics are lame, his lyrics are better than a lot of other singers!!! What appeals to me is that no other singer is like him, he's different and a fresh of breath air. \\"Chariot\\" is a type of album that you can listen over and over again and his songs are fun to sing to!!! :)
B000002H97|1.0|and to the world where mall-\\"metal\\" started being played at preppy high school parties. Yup my friends, this is the end for metallica, and where Megadeth gladly took over! This is the album that got preppy football players in their white college hats playing \\"metal\\" at their lame parties. This is also where you can tell that the only cool member reaming in this horrid, over-rated band is Jason. I would stay in it too just for the money like he did if i wasn't an original member. This also is the begining of pop rock producer bob cock rock. If you've managed to sit thru the lame ass year in the half of selloutica vidoes, you'll see lar$ making fun of their new cd on the part where he goes \\"arena rock\\". Yup, best to stay away from this kids, get something good like Megadeth, Immortal, Typhus, etc.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah fans, get the Ultra Platinum Edition and you won't be disappointed. THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI is one of the best albums of 2005. If you're a fan of her earlier work and you've hesitated buying this, now is the time to take a chance. You don't want to miss out on one of her best CD's.
0743527305|4.0|I have just finished reading this book, and feel the need to set the record straight on what Dr. Peck actually did and did not say.  F.D. Tardif, a previous reviewer here has stated,  <br /> <br />\\"As Peck says at the end of the book \\"If you have gotten this far, you probably don't need therapy\\". If one has the discipline and the intellectual openess for the latter challenging parts of the book, he is probably right.\\"   <br /> <br />I'm nearly positive the words this reviewer puts in quotation marks are NOT a direct quote, and in my humble opinion, greatly misrepresent Dr. Peck's ideas.  Peck's actual statement at the end of the book (pp. 312-313) is as follows: <br /> <br />\\"And I continue to believe that most of those who fail to benefit from work with a competent therapist do so because they lack the taste and will for the rigors of that work.  However I did neglect to specify that a small minority of people --perhaps five percent -- have psychiatric problems of a nature that does not respond to psychotherapy and that may even be made worse by the deep introspection involved.  Anyone who has succeeded in thouroughly reading and understanding this book is highly unlikely to belong to that five percent.\\"  <br /> <br />Rather than suggest that a successful reader of his book doesn't need therapy, as reviewer Tardif has attempted to paraphase, Peck conveys that a successful reader is highly UNlikely to belong to the five percent of people who DO NOT benefit from psychotherapy.  In fact, he seems to believe that his readers are the type of people who are strong enough to stomach the hard work that therapy requires.  If Peck truly believed that one's ability to complete and comprehend his book was a test of whether a person needs therapy, he wouldn't have put his suggestions on how to find a suitable therapist at the END of the book.  Peck's entire book is an advocate for continuous therapy or introspection throughout one's lifetime in order to continue the spiritual evolution of humankind.
B00005JO17|4.0|Animation was very good. <br />  <br />Characters were adorable. <br /> <br />Plot was a little simple, but still okay. Perfect for the little ones. It's 'Chicken Little' people, not 'War and Peace'! <br /> <br />I saw the movie in a theater full of little ones and they all loved it. <br /> <br />All in all, a fine first solo attempt at CG for Disney. <br /> <br />Ignore the cynical one and two star reviews. Those people were obviously looking for something more sophisticated. Why anyone would be looking for sophistication from a movie named 'Chicken Little' is beyond me, but common sense is in short supply these days. <br /> <br />
0060392886|5.0|This book is the sh*t!!!  It explains why this band ruled the eighties and part of the next decade and why it is still a band that is still admired and well respected by the public and by the name of ROCK AND F*CK#NG ROLL !!!!!!! <br />
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This re-release is the best!!!!! <br /> <br />The CD includes 3 all-new songs and 1 remix of the hit \\"We Belong Together\\" (with new vocals!) <br /> <br />The all-new songs are fabulous: <br />1. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" <br />it's a great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. \\"Makin' It Last All Night (What I Do)\\" <br />9/10 <br /> <br />3. \\"So Lonely (One & Only pt II)\\" <br />This is not a remix of \\"One & Only\\", it's even better than this one. 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />The DVD is incredible, because the clips of \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" are the best videos i've ever seen. Mariah looks beautiful and best than ever. <br /> <br />Videos: <br />1. It's Like That  <br />2. We Belong Together  <br />3. Shake It Off  <br />4. Get Your Number <br />Plus a link for the \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" video.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Enough people have talked about the history behind the movie and debated its genre that I'll be very brief: this is the best adventure film since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.   Wonderfully smart (and witty!) archetypal characters, a simple us-against-them story that evolves into something much larger, and expertly-scripted, unbearably tense action sequences smattered throughout.  Serenity is going to become one of those perfect lazy-Saturday toss-it-in-the-DVD-player and just relax kind of movies, perfect on the shelf alongside Raiders or Butch and Sundance.  A great, incredibly accessible entertainment.
B0000508U6|5.0|ugh. I just like this album so much. I dont care if anyone else does. I just need to go listen to it and try to drown out the stupidity that surrounds me. Listen to it and like it or dont Whatever.  <br />p.s. There is a possibility that there is a hidden track somewhere on the album. Maybe, like on the last track. But you didnt hear it from me.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've never been inclined to write a review of a CD before.  Until now.  Because X & Y is more than just music.  I tend to be obsessive compulsive and precise.  Mathematics and science are exquisite to me.  Perhaps that's why I like Coldplay's X & Y so much.  It is precise.  It is crisp.  No slurred words or poetic but meaningless phrases, the lyrics speak clearly.  No smeared notes or mushy percussion, the music is sharp and strong. <br /> <br />The first time I heard the songs, I wasn't sure what just  happened.  And then like a pebble dropped in a still pond, the ripples from the music spread outward and grew bigger and I wondered what just touched my soul.  There are a thousand notes. And a million musicians.  But when one crystal tuning fork sounds one crystal note, it resonates all the way to your bones.  That's what this CD did.  I was surprised.  I cried.  And the music fixed me.
0671781383|5.0|Of all the \\"maven\\"/talking heads\\" that appear on TV and radio,I have always considered the most spaced out to be the various categories of shrinks.The one exception who easily comes to mind is Victor Frankl(1905-1997) who founded 'logotherapy' which he distinguishes from psycoanalysis with,\\"Now in logotherapy the patient may remain sitting erect but he must hear things which sometimes are very disagreeable to hear(p.104).\\"And Frankl brings a strong moral basis to his 'therapy' largely based on lessons learned during the three years he was imprisoned in Aushwitz;in his forward,Frankl,who had a visa to leave his native Austria,decided to stay with his parents,influenced by a piece of marble his father managed to salvage from a  representation   of 'The Ten Commandments' from Vienna's largest synagogue which the Nazi's destroyed.The salvaged piece of marble was from The Commandment 'To Honor Your Mother and Father'(p.13). <br /> <br />But,with one sentence Frankl shatters all the nonsense coming from \\"mavens\\" and modern culture:\\"...From this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world,but only these two-the \\"race\\" of the decent man and the \\"race of the indecent man\\"(p.94). <br />
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Ok, I listened to this album on AOL, I have to say that this is pretty bad. I'm not someone who dislikes Madonna, in fact I own all her albums. This is a lazy attempt to cash in on the market -- since Kylie is ill, and Britney is on maternity leave. There is nothing original about this album just a blatant rip off from Kylie, artwork looks very similar to Impossible Princess. Future Lovers sounds like a lesser remake of Light Years. I hate the fact that Madonna is making it seem like this concept is so original 'All Dance', Kylie did it before with far more succesful results, do yourself a favor and pick up \\"Fever\\", at least that was enjoyable and not nearly as pretentious. I still love Madonna, just not liking this mediocre attempt.
1559408855|5.0|This movie represents one of the highest results of italian cinema.  The sex you see in Salo is a metaphorical representation of the sex  in the capitalist age: a mechanical act through which the mighty overwhelm people, a representation of the reduction of the body into an object through the capitalist exploitation of men. The Fascism is also a metaphor of all the powers. In fact you see in the movie 4 fascist libertines which represents the executive, judicial, religious and economic power. According to Pasolini the power is always anarchy, the power always tries to annihilate human personality, to homologate people. And if you see the modern world, in which people are not really integrated but merely assimilated by the global society, Pasolini was not so wrong. There are many other metaphoric concepts in this great movie, but i have no time to explain them all.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Epic...outstanding...grandiose... ambitious...visionary... theatrical... majestic... monumental...exciting...classical... timeless... fantastic... mythological... emotional...breathtaking... electrifying...exhilarant... eye-popping... far out... fine... flashy... hectic... compelling...impressive... intoxicating<br /><br />How does one describe the greatest rock album of all time?<br /><br />When Born to Run was being made Bruce Springsteen knew it was his shot at the title and he went for it with an indefatigable passion. The pressure was on. His backers at Columbia had moved on...the sales of \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\" and \\"the Wild the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle\\" had been less than impressive though both albums were critically well received. Bruce and his band mates new they were in danger of being dumped from the label if they didn't come up with a triumph.<br /><br />Springsteen had a sound in his head, a big sound and a big song in Born to Run but getting that song and sound to match what he was hearing in his mind was proving to be frustrating and taxing. With meticulous dedication and grueling sixteen hour days in the studio and overdub after overdub after overdub Springsteen and the E Street band were finally able to achieve the Spectorish \\"Wall of Sound\\" they had been searching for and a classic was...well.... born.<br /><br />In the process two band members were lost, Springsteen's then manager Mike Appel was at the beginning of the end of his business association with Bruce and John Landau, the man who was to write that he'd seen the future of rock and roll after seeing Bruce perform, came on board beginning a collaboration of like minds that has lasted to this day. Despite all the pratfalls, if asked if he'd do it all again I imagine Bruce would not hesitate because the end result took him to the top and enabled him to get everything he could have hoped for and more out of a musical career.<br /><br />I was a kid when I fell in love with the album. I heard Born to Run blasting through the radio and had to have it for my own. It was the first song (that wasn't a nursery rhyme) that I remember having any investment in. Thirty years later with this special commemorative edition I now have eight copies of it.<br /><br />First obviously was the original LP then I had to have it on cassette for the tape deck in my parent's car. The third version was the LP again when I just had to buy a copy when the family was on an extended Christmas vacation at my grandparents' house. Then CD's were invented and of course it was the first CD I brought. My CD player back then was a five CD disk changer and Born to Run had a permanent place in the number one slot. This proved to be problematic when I got a CD player in my car so along came version number six. Then I met my future wife and had to buy her a copy so she could learn to<br /><br /> some extent what she may be getting herself into, of course we live together now so it's `our' copy. Then there's this latest, greatest edition in remastered digital sound with the terrific extras.<br /><br />Obsessed?<br /><br />Maybe.........a little anyway.<br /><br />Born to run is more than just the collection of individual songs....it's more than the wall of sound...it's more than the beauty and poetry of the lyrics....it's more than the passion and promise that the album contains.....it's a sum of all it's parts.<br /><br />The themes of freedom, escape and redemption that are evident throughout are intrinsic to those that lay at the heart of rock and roll. The promise of that magic in the night, the question of is love real. Somehow less becomes more as the album was stripped back and condensed in comparison to what Springsteen had done before. His previous releases had been wordy and verbose, the byline for Greetings stating that Bruce was a performer who could put more into one song than most artists put into an entire album.  Here he was able to tell more story in less words and the words he used conveyed a cinematic imagery with characters that we can all imagine with lives and hearts and minds of their own. Lives and stories that for a brief moment we can invest in and feel as if they contain a little piece of ourselves.<br /><br />Thirty years on and the album still resonates as much now as it did back then and this latest edition is a fitting tribute. The packaging is terrific. Of course the iconic cover of Bruce slumped over Clarence's shoulder complete with impish grin, his Elvis badge and the famous Esquire telecaster slung alongside like an old West gunslinger. Inside the album itself is packaged like the original LP in a gatefold sleeve. The silver part of the disk is black and the picture side is made out like a record complete with grooves. Another CD cover containing the Born to Run single and the B side Meeting Across the River is set up to look like a record in it's sleeve.<br /><br />The picture booklet is a collection of photo's from the Born to Run era as taken by photographer Eric Meola who was responsible for the classic image that became the albums cover. Somewhat disappointingly the intro to this booklet is an exert from Bruce's book songs rather than something written originally for the release. For mine it would have been interesting to hear what Bruce feels about the album thirty years on and what it means to him today.<br /><br />The sleeve for the DVD of the E Street bands first concert abroad at London's Hammersmith Odeon is more satisfying as it is originally penned and in fact written the day before Bruce's birthday this past September. Bruce talks about how he felt about the hype and the marquee and the tearing down of the posters and the tension before the show. The DVD itself is the first official full release concert from the preceding century. Though the release proclaims this is never before seen footage there is quite a few bootleggers who would beg to disagree. Bruce acknowledges as much when he mentions that the\\" legendary performance marked only in memory, bits of bootleg tape and `I was there when' stories\\" For those that have the bootleg concert I would suggest that both versions are from the same source as it has the same grainy elements and camera angles. For those that have not seen it, this is not the buff Springsteen who muscled his way through the Born in the USA tour but a taut, skinny, hungry performer going for broke to win over a foreign audience with an impassioned delivery. It highlights why Springsteen and the E Street band garnered their reputations for being the premiere live performers in concert that they remain to this day.<br /><br />The third disk is a wonderful little documentary titled \\"Wings for wheels\\" which was one of the original titles for the song that came to be known as \\"Thunder Road\\". The disk contains archival footage from the making of the album and current footage from all the key players including ex band members Ernest \\"Boom\\" Carter and David Sancious as well as the production team. Highlights include some of the versions (both good and downright cringe worthy) that didn't make the final cut, modern acoustic versions of select songs with detailed explanations in the mode of the recent Storytellers DVD and the Somerville theatre benefit shows from 2003 and a small segment that has Bruce showing of the famed Esquire telecaster.<br /><br />The DVD concludes with a live three-song performance from 1973 including Spirit in the night, Wild Billy's Circus story and Thundercrack.<br /><br />All in all it's a great testament to the greatest album and while I'm aware that most everyone who will purchase this is probably as bad as myself when it come to all things Bruce I congratulate those who are about to be introduced to Mary, Wendy, Terry, Eddie, the Magic Rat, the barefoot girl, Scooter and the Big Man for the very first time.

B000803PKY|1.0|The music is great, but the DVD is nothing more than a collection of pictures (i.e., STILL IMAGES) from the concert tour. I should have read the fine print. Today, one just naturally expects concert footage. Put on the CD you've already got, surf the web for Jackson Browne web sites and spend the money on something else.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The diva has returned to the disco. The swirling, throbbing and altogether great \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is Madonna's nonstop ecstatic cabaret. The 12-song set takes some of its musical cues from the likes of Giorgio Moroder and Richard X, though it remains thoroughly and uniquely a work of Madonna, who never gets lost in the dizzying beats and dense production. The tunes focus on self-discovery (\\"How High\\"), enlightenment (\\"Future Lovers,\\" \\"Get Together\\"), empowerment (\\"Jump\\") and love (\\"Push\\"). There are also fluffier cuts: a rocking dance anthem in \\"I Love New York,\\" the ABBA-sampling lead single \\"Hung Up\\" and the springy \\"Sorry.\\" In the wake of 2003's dead-on-arrival \\"American Life,\\" \\"Confessions\\" is a welcome return to form for the Queen of Pop. -Keith Caulfield <br /> <br />
B000B8QF14|5.0|When I read the reviews for this before I had a chance to get out, I was very nervous that I would be dissapointed. However, I was very happy with it. I, like many others, was dissapointed that they cut songs out (especially She). I did not find the interviews annoying. I thought they were interesting, and did not lose the rush. As soon as the next song started I was right back into it. One thing I did find slightly annoying was the filming from behind Green Day and a lot and switching to black and white. That, to me, took the momentum away more than the interviews...because it felt like you were falling out of the concert. They were making it obvious that you were not there by switching to black and white. <br /> <br />The CD part is awesome. I love live versions of songs, because you get the feeling of how special the moment is. Billy lets the crowd sing a lot of parts and that sounds so awesome to me <br /> <br />All in all, it is great!

B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Tim Burton is one of those directors whose style is immediatly recognisable. From the Danny Elfman music score to the fairy tale-esque imagery and quirky characters that populate his films, Burton's films standout. Having said that, all the elements are here , a somewhat fantastical tall tale, great actors and beautiful scenes. And yet all these ingredients really didnt work for me. Instead this film became a Tim Burton by numbers film that sticks to every tired cliche he has. <br /> <br />The movie is about a young man who has listened to his father (played by Albert Finney) tell unbelievable tales all his life. At his wedding he finds he has reached his limit as his father steals the attention from he and his new bride to tell the story of the whopper fish he caught. What ensues is a series of flashbacks where a young father(played by Ewan McGregor) goes through a series of tales so impossible to believe that they border on the ridiculous. Towards the film's climax father and son come full circle and have an understanding of each other. <br /> <br />The cast here are okay. Albert Finney does a fine job as does Danny Devito. I love Ewan McGregor who is usually fantastic at changing his accent. In this film though it appears he has made the mistake of looking to \\"Gone with the wind\\" to try and mimick a Soutern accent- it didnt work. Still he is so likeable you cant  help but forgive him. <br /> <br />The film was an okay motion picture but felt like more style than substance and didnt really leave much of an impression. Overall a good journey but one not worth retaking.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is excelent, one of her best. The songs I like the most are: Hung up, Sorry,Forbidden Love, Isaac, Jump, and How High. Buy it and enjoy it, you won't be dissapointed.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|A Moderate Album for a Musical Icon cum Queen of Dance / Pop / Re-invention.    Considering the fact that her marketing team is comparing this album against \\"Ray Of Light\\" and \\"Like A Prayer\\"    Reasons:  1) The lyrics are not creative. A lack of substance (unlike lyrics from the aforementioned albums)  2) Certain rhythms and melody stylings are directly taken from other artistes such as Kylie's (Princess of Dance?) Light Years. Madonna taking from a Wannabe?  3) Poor flow of song organisation. Top 7 tracks electronic mixing styles different than the bottom ones. Inconsistent in terms of the \\"feel\\" derived from the styles (instrumentation and electronic production)  4) Starting from track 7, the music style is utilising Madonna's old style of mixing, which is disappointing, considering she is the Queen of Re-invention. Not to mention, the style utilised does not sound like something fresh and influential.  5) Most melody lines are generally downtempo.  6) The songs with heavily vocoded vocals are generally not mixed in a way that is interesting. Most of the time, it induces sleepiness.
B000B0WO0I|5.0|It's as simple as that: following the recording of acoustic versions of his STARS-album classics for the DVD Classic Albums, Mick Hucknall decided to record other Simply Red classics in an acoustic way to make a whole new album. And he was right to do so because it's truly a great album. His last album, HOME, was already a success and instead of making a new album with new songs, he decides to make a stop in his discography and takes a look at his past albums.<br /><br />The new versions of FAIRGROUND and FOR YOUR BABIES (already in the Classic albums Stars DVD) are really the best tracks here but it's quite relaxing to hear all this acoustic music in a musical environment where everything you hear is rap music or loud guitars.<br /><br />Mick Hucknall truly shows (although it wasn't necessary) his talent here and in a very beautiful and pure way.<br /><br />Maybe in America, Simply Red is not as popular as in Europe (where the group still reaches the top spot each time) but simply listen to the beauty of the melodies and the lyrics and you'll understand why Mick is still here more than 20 years after the Simply Red adventure began.
0780631684|5.0|I thought this movie did an excellent job for the type of movie that is is, a teen thriller. I also thought it can become very morbid as the movie progresses and the characters are continually dodging or getting checked out by Death. Anymore of the mouse-trap plays would have been overkill - so it was just about right. The screenplay is well thought out, as it tries to define Death in the terms that people have chosen to use for a subject we will never fully understand. <br /> <br />For an entertaining thriller, I give this one two thumbs up.
B000B5UL7G|4.0|First of all, the single TRIPPING is one of the best singles Robbie ever made. So we could expect a very good album, written with a new partner. Instead of that, we get a carbon-copy of his previous album, ESCAPOLOGY. It's really the same type of contemporary pop/rock music with the same old ballads he should avoid now.<br /><br />I hope someday he makes another SING WHEN YOU'RE WINNING type of album (his best so far - with more pop music than rock music)but for the moment Robbie has decided to stick with his rock and roll style.<br /><br />It seems a bit dated by moment (seems like it was recorded in the eighties)but overall this is a good album by the world's biggest pop music record-seller.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|i really don't know what's more hilarious, madonna thinking this collection of refried techno nytol with the dumb-as-a-rock lyrics is actually going to help her reinvent her sagging career for the umpteenth time, or her apparently-delusional diehard fans giving this cd 5 stars. lol or perhaps it is the fact that when record sales are down, the soon-to-be 48-year old woman with the midlife career crisis feels she has to try soooooo damn hard to appear to be still hip and relevant (lol) that she has to revert at this stage of her career to the same skanky eurotrash that originally gained her notoriety many blue moons ago, though yet, still the kind of eurotrash that even the likes of britney spears would never be caught dead singing. and to think that madonna's career was initially based on finding creative ways of shocking her fans. this latest effort is neither shocking nor creative, with many of the hooks lifted right out of some of yesteryear's better dance songs. i guess madonna's just plain run out of reinventions at this point. it was bound to happen sooner or later, though. i mean, when you've managed to build an entire career as an alleged 'singer-actress' like she has, without the slightest hint of talent in either department, getting older is only bound to reveal her incredible lack of talent even more, especially as a vocalist. her 'live' singing voice sounds so damn amateurish, it is actually embarrassing to listen to. honestly, when performing live, she ought to lip synch ONLY from now on. after all, i doubt even her most fanatical fans would still cling to the foolish notion that the woman can somehow carry a tune. she was best in her early years when her boundless energy could at least somewhat offset her nearly nonexistent singing ability. i have one bit of advice for those of you who may have been misled into thinking this cd actually offers anything even remotely pseudo-innovative: save your money and sample the songs on the web first. chances are,unless you're a diehard madonna fanatic, you're going to be sadly disappointed if you're looking for substance, quality, or creativity here. and even if techno-synth is your bag, i can think of 10 other acts who do it 100 times better than madonna and her handlers.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Unfortunately, the album is not as good as the first single which is a killer hit single by the way (N°1 in all Europe, contrary to the US).<br /><br />The first part consists of dull dance music always on the same rhythm. Only HUNG UP stands out. The better tracks are on the second part of the album with incredible songs like PUSH or ISAAC.<br /><br />So, for me, the dance concept only works for the six or seven first tracks then it's a normal album (thankfully).<br /><br />If you want to compare, it's a mix of the albums YOU CAN DANCE for the first tracks and LIKE A PRAYER for the last ones.<br /><br />Better start the album at track N°7 and skip the first songs except HUNG UP.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Most 1 stars for this album is actually from an organisation of Mariah Carey fan's calling themselves TeamLamb. It's an organisation (of 25-30 year olds acting like 5) whose mainly purpose is to trash other major artists out there and glorify Mariah as much as possible, their main target is offcourse Madonna.  Offcourse some 1 stars may be personally opinions but if you read their reviews their mostly short and doesn't really focus on the music and without any details, mostly it's clear they never even heard the album. They are just put out to trash and destroy, some even writing desperate things like \\"buy Mariah instead\\" etc.  I am not against Mariah and her latest album was really good but I still need to warn for those \\"fake\\" reviews since they are just to trash and doesn't make a fair judging on the album.    Back to the album...  It is really a grower. Some songs are good from the first listen but many need to grow on you. If you take the time to listen to this album you will truly start to like at least most of the songs. That is what also make this album so amazing, it's made for thinking AND for dancing. You first hear the beats and music but to connect you need to take your time with the music.  It's not an easy album, it is not like the other mainstream music out there. It's very brave of Madonna to put out such an album in a world dominated of almost only R&B and HipHop, and believe me I'm a hardcore R&B fan too but Madonna makes some freshness to the music industry and to mainstream music as she alwayd did and also with this album.   The standout tracks are \\"Hung Up\\", the eastern-flavor mystical \\"Isaac\\" which sort of has the same vibe as Frozen but in a dance-way and \\"Push\\" where Madonna takes the modern R&B sound and mix it with her own sound, \\"Push\\" is not R&B, It's Madonna sound mixed with R&B. After listen to the album sometime I have to say I don't dislike any of the songs. Some of them just takes more time to get into.   The album is really fresh and as I wrote it's a grower and you will not be dissappointed! The first time you will think: \\"it's nothing special\\"... but the curiousity will make you want to listen to it again and again and after a while you gonna be hooked, trust me. That's true music, music that doesn't jump directly on you but that you have to explore too, using your brains (and also in this case offcourse your feet).  A must buy for christmas gift and a must for the new years eve party or any other party.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna has done many things in her three-decade career: she's been an actress, a author, and of course a singer but her music has often developed far beyond where it initially began - the dance clubs of New York City at the end of the disco era. Now after sampling basically every other style, Madonna returns to with an album custom made not for the top 40 but for the dancefloor that spawned her and where she has returned time and again with remixes these many years but never a proper dance album. 'Confessions' delivers - it doesn't deliver so much in the 'confessions' department (the lyrics are standard Madonna's politics, Madonna talks about fame, etc) but she gets the dancefloor part right; the beat never dies in this hour-long festival.    The early hype for this album was that Madonna was going to 're-invent dance music for a new generation' - this sets the bar high, and this is not exactly accomplished, but what is taking the best of the past and a ear for the cutting edge and putting it together - and the result is slick, cool and precise. The set's first single \\"Hung Up\\" is really nothing to go by - all hiNRG and chaotic - the rest of the album takes it down a bit, this is after-midnight dance. This is 'Ray of Light' taken to another level, this music is best appreciated when not sober. It is aurally strong - it is not so much a wall of sound but like a fog that comes out of the speakers and envelops the listener. Madonna's voice is not in the lead like most of her records but far back in the mix - she if anyone knows that dance music is about the beat, and words are meant to be played, repeated and thrown - not necessarily emphasized.    The album is not short of hooks though - songs like 'Get Together', 'Sorry', 'Jump' - these have hooks like the classic Madonna records and the rest, such as 'Future Lovers', 'Forbidden Love' have faraway, haunting vocals where one or two lines are repeated, weaving in and out of the music. The album is designed to not havestops and starts but to flow from one song into the next and avoid silence, this is done well, but with mainly one producer at the helm (Stuart Price), Price's signature sound tends to become samey. Price, for all his musical gifts, is not a Mirwais or Pat Leonard who created distinctive beats for each song and 'Confessions' tends to blur into one, leaving, again, Price's wizardry to create distinction between songs.    'Confessions' is an album like no other Madonna album nor any pop album at the moment - on the artist's own terms, doing what that artist does best, once again, not designed for the play-it-safe top 40 but the wild world of the clubs. Madonna's stab at 'future disco' comes out splendidly well.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I've never owned a Madonna CD before this one... Singles only. This is a listen-through, well mastered, well considered CD with great flow from the first track to the last-- as intended.<br /><br />The CD would be great as an acoustic, but unlike Devil Days/Gorillaz, the lyrics do not detract from the beats and the flow.<br /><br />It has a great feel, enduces adrenaline and endorphins simultaneously. A driving baseline throughout, and intricate mixes of familiar and new sounds.  A great driving CD.<br /><br />Fits in my category of \\"Bests\\" including Moby's \\"Play\\" and Nine Inch Nails \\"The Fragile\\" Disc 2. An auditory adventure that is tightly woven, interesting, but doesn't pass the line into monotonous.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|If you liked the Emancipation of Mimi, then you will probably love this album even more. With this album comes four new tracks, along with a DVD of 4 of her videos (Its Like that, we belong together, shake it off, get your number). The reason Don't forget about us is not on this DVD was because of label issues with the label. <br /> <br />For some people who do not know, the video for get your number was relased in Europe. Get your number has hit #8 on the British pop charts, and continues to do well. <br /> <br />Dont Forget About Us: it sounds like a cheap version of We Belong Together in my opinion. Still, this song is very catchy and will still be liked. Although to me she seems to be trying to capture the sucess \\"Together\\" had. <br /> <br />Making it Last All Night: Another track with her and JD, this time JD raps. I do believe this is a catchy song, which if released to radio, will do well. It is very catchy and is a good song for this album. Still, it feels like another version of Get your Number <br /> <br />So Lonely (AKA One and Only Pt 2): The next single off of Mariah and Twista's album(s). This is another version of One and Only, where Mariah and Twista do a duo. I do believe the song on Twista's album is better than this song in my opinion. This will become a hit with no doubt, but it is questionable how people feel about this song. <br /> <br />We Belong Together: Still, the remix has never appealed to me as much as the original, which is still the best song of the year. Never-the-less, this remix is fair compared to her other remixes. The beat gets old after a while, and the raps do nothing big for this song. Her extra words are okay for this song. Still, this is a good dance song. <br /> <br />This album does deserve 5 stars in my opinion. It is currently the biggest album of 2005, beating 50 cent. Still, she could have released some concert footage for the DVD and put \\"Sprung\\", \\"Secret Love\\", and \\"Shake it off remix\\" on this album for more.
B000AP04OM|2.0|This review is for the latest 40th Anniversary 2DVD edition, released on 15 Nov. 2005. While there are some improvements on the new DVD transfer, the film still doesn't look as it was meant to bee seen. First of all, the definition is lacking and the color overall is very pale, subdued and faded looking as well as quite inconsistant especially in an interior scenes. This film was shot in a 70MM process called TODD-AO, a larger format than a standard 35MM, that yields a very high fidelity image and rich color on screen. None of those qualities are found on this new anniversary DVD edition. The good thing is, the film is presented in a proper widescreen aspect ratio. No pan-and-scan crap that cut off almost 2/3 of the image, especially in a long shots (there are lots in this film) like those found in early, old VHS video editions. So you can see the full widescreen composition of this beautifully shot film. The bad thing is, too many miss & match materials were used for this transfer. Why don't 20th Century Fox Home Video uses the best source material for this anniversary transfer, I wonder. It seems they want to go for a cheap video production to gain as much profit as possible. The new Oklahoma! 50th anniversary looks extremely bad. I won't buy classics DVDs from Fox again, unless I rent them first and judge it from there.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|When I heard Hung Up, I immediately fell in love with this album and contemplated getting it. I decided to use the First Listen on AOL to make up my mind on this album, and it did.  <br /> <br />The best song on this album has to be Hung Up by far. The song gives a past feel to it, but also pushes the genre in the future. I thought this track would top the top 10, but it has not done so far.  <br /> <br />As far as the other songs go, they could have been better. Some of the lyrics did not make sense, but most dance songs usually do.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks on this album include Get Together, Isaac, Let it Will Be, Hung Up, Jump, and Push.  <br /> <br />This album is recomended to true fans. For dance lovers, buy this album as well. For people who do not know if they will like this, I recomend looking at AOL or MTV.com for listening sessions.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Who is Shania Twain? .....for those of you whe were living under a rock during the mid to late 90's, she is the female who re-defined country music for the better good with a breath of fresh air, a unique style, exceptional songwriting, attitude, strong independent character and a versitile musical arrangement along with rock solid production. ...oh and she is one of the most successful artists in history, her \\"Come On Over\\" album is the biggest selling album EVER by a female artist and the 5th or so biggest selling album of all time. It is basically the female equivalent of Thriller!  <br />Shania writes all of her own songs and melodies on guitar and does a wonderful job singing them. But not only that, she earned her way to stardom by growing up extremely poor, having her birth father walk out on her at a young age, singing in bars at night from the age of 8, losing BOTH her parents in a car accident at 21 and having to cut her chances of having a musical career short to parent her younger sibelings while singing at a resort to pay the bills, so she has truly payed her dues.  <br /> <br />Now that Shania has finally released her Greatest Hits album, you can have all her greatest songs on 1 CD! Admittedly, I could list a whole other CD's worth of great Shania songs which were left off but this is still a mighty strong collection and gives you a good idea of who Shania is as an artist and a person and I would definitily recommend looking into her other albums also. <br /> <br />Forever and For Always: 10/10 - Lovely, breezy ballad, my favorite Shania song! Beautiful lyrics, excellent melody, and Shania shows off great vocal range without going over the top like certain other female artists.  <br /> <br />I'm Gonna Getcha Good: 9/10 - The more rock side of Shania! Very sassy, infectious lyrics and great beat...Shania will \\"Getcha Good\\" with this song!  <br /> <br />UP!: 9/10 - If this song doesn't Up! your mood then nothing will.  <br /> <br />Come On Over: 9/10 - Nice unique sound...great beat and an admirable display of Shania's great personality.  <br /> <br />Man! I Feel Like A Woman!: 10/10 - One of Shania's trademark songs. Shania just nails it with her attitude and charisma! Great lyrics, great guitar riffs, great guitar solo, great song!  <br /> <br />That Don't Impress Me Much: 10/10 - Another of Shania's trademark songs. Great song about what a woman wants in a guy. More then just good looks, cars and all that other fancy crap, it takes something deeper then that to impress Shania!  <br /> <br />From This Moment On: 10/10 - Ok, everything about this song is just pure excellence! THE ultimate love song. Epic ballad about true love, almost haunting at how beautiful it is....gorgeous vocals and killer guitar solo!  <br /> <br />Honey, I'm Home: 9/10 - The more country side of Shania. Great fiddles and interesting lyrics.  <br /> <br />You're Still The One: 10/10 - Another of Shania's trademark songs. Beautiful ballad about beating the odds and true love.  <br /> <br />Don't Be Stupid: 9/10 - Great song about trust. Killer beat and awesome fiddles.  <br /> <br />Love Gets Me Every Time: 8/10 - Nice song about unexpectedly falling in love. Another display of Shania's country side.  <br /> <br />No One Needs To Know: 9/10 - Great country song with catchy lyrics.  <br /> <br />You Win My Love: 8/10 - Good song with some nice riffs!  <br /> <br />I'm Outta Here: 9/10 - Excellent statement about being in a relationship for love otherwise \\"I'm Outta Here\\"!  <br /> <br />The Woman In Me: 10/10 - Really intimate ballad! Magical!  <br /> <br />Any Man Of Mine: 10/10 - Shania's breakthrough and arguably best country song, excellent attitude and lyrics!  <br /> <br />Whose Bed Have Your Boots: 9/10 - Great tongue in cheek country song about adultery.  <br /> <br />Party for Two (with Mark McGrath): 7/10 - Not bad, although I prefere the version with Billy Currington.  <br /> <br />Don't!: 9.5/10 - Haunting ballad about forgiveness.<br /> <br />Party for Two (with Billy Currington): 10/10 - Excellent beat and extremely catchey lyrics! Really fun!  <br /> <br />I Ain't No Quitter: 8/10 - One of those songs you'll probably either love or hate. Really country/swing sounding, a real grower.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I was expecting good things from this album.  Even though the current single \\"Hung Up\\" isnt anything groundbreaking, I thought I would give it a try.  I am embarassed to say I bought this CD.  There is nothing on here that sounds like a legendary singer.  Madonna, this might be the end of the road for you.  I am very disappointed in this album.
B0006284JQ|5.0|We all know who Britney Spears is. Britney has been one of the most successful female recording artists since that of Madonna & Cher. From 1999 to 2003, Britney had released four albums entitled: ...BABY ONE MORE TIME (1999), OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN (2000), BRITNEY (2001), & IN TH ZONE (2003). But in 2004, Britney released her fifth album entitled, GREATEST HITS: MY PREROGATIVE. This album is Britney's first greatest hits compilation that features fourteen of Britney's best songs, along with three new songs.  <br /> <br />MY PREROGATIVE  <br />New song. The first single from the album. Back in 1988, Bobby Brown had recorded this song and it was one Bobby's major hits. Now, I am more than fond of Bobby Brown's version. But when I heard Britney's version, I was more than impressed. So impressed, in fact I thought that Bobby Brown would be happy with this version.  <br /> <br />TOXIC  <br />From the album In The Zone (2003). This was the second single from the fourth album, and another one of Britney's #1 hit singles. This is one hell of a classic song. The sound is just unbelievably ingenious. Gotta love seeing Britney wearing that see-through rhinestone outfit in the song's music video.  <br /> <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U  <br />From the album Britney (2001). The third album was incredible, just like its first single. The song talks about how Britney feels like a slave to the music she is dancing to. I think that this song's music video was Britney's most sexual yet, where she is dancing with all guys, where she appears to sweating heavily. The dance moves are so risqu, Madonna would have been proud of it.  <br /> <br />OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN  <br />From the album Oops!...I Did It Again (2000). This was yet another #1 hit for Ms. Spears. The whole album was one of Britney's greatest works and it will always be one of my favorite albums. The music video to this song is nothing more than ingenious.  <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (Duet with Madonna)  <br />From the albumIn The Zone (2003). Madonna has been my biggest idol for the past nine years, and to have Madonna and Britney sing this incredible song together was the one of the best things I had ever heard. When the ladies were rehearsing for their opening number for the 2003 MTV VMAs, Britney had let Madonna hear this song, and that was when Britney had said to Madonna, \\"...You have to be on this song...\\". Madonna thought it a swell idea and recorded her vocals onto the song.  <br /> <br />STRONGER  <br />From the album Oops!...I Did It Again (2000). This is one of my favorite songs from the second album because of incredible sound in music. The video will always be one of Britney's greatest music videos of all time.  <br /> <br />EVERYTIME  <br />From the album In The Zone (2003). When I first heard this song, I fell in love with instantly and hoped that Britney would release it as a single. As it would turn out, Britney did release it as a single. The video was quite disturbing. It shows Britney with actor, Stephen Dorff, who came to act as Britney's boyfriend. The two are rushing through a crowd of papparzzi. As they reach Britney's place, Britney heads off into the bathroom and readies herself for a bath. As she sits in the bath, she slides underneath the water, performing an onscreen suicide, which disturbed many people around the world.  <br /> <br />...BABY ONE MORE TIME  <br />From the album ...Baby One More Time (1999). Britney's first single and first #1 hit. Everytime I hear this song, I always think of the time when this song and album were first released. It was the spring of 1999, I was coming towards the end of my eighth grade year and I remember when I got this album, I listened to it 24/7. This song and album takes me back to my eighth grade year.  <br /> <br />(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY (The Stop! Remix)  <br />From the original motion picture & soundtrack Drive Me Crazy (1999). Original version from the album ...Baby One More Time (1999). Now, you will find the original version of this song on Britney's first album. The song was released as a single, but for the video, Britney decided to use this remix, in order to provide the edgy dance moves.  <br /> <br />BOYS (The Co-ed Remix) (Duet with Pharrell Williams of N.E.R.D.)  <br />From the original motion picture soundtrack Austin Powers In Goldmember (2002). Original version from the album Britney (2001). For this song, Britney did the same thing as she did with (You Drive Me) Crazy. The original version of this song, which can be found on Britney's third album, was released as the single, but this remix was used for the video.  <br /> <br />SOMETIMES  <br />From the album ...Baby One More Time (1999). Britney's second single and one of her absolute best. The music video is one my favorites, because it takes place in Malibu, CA. I just thought that the location was perfect.  <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED (The Darkchild Remix Radio Edit)  <br />Original version from the album Britney (2001). Although, I love the song, this remix is not worth listening to.  <br /> <br />LUCKY  <br />From the album Oops!...I Did It Again (2000). This is a great song with a great story line about an actress named Lucky, who has everything, while being a big celebrity, but she is very unhappy.  <br /> <br />OUTRAGEOUS  <br />From the album In The Zone (2003). Great song, with a great sound.  <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN  <br />From the album Britney (2001). This is one of the best ballads Britney has every sang, for it talks about seeing her as an adult, instead of an overprotected child.  <br /> <br />I'VE JUST BEGUN (HAVING MY FUN)  <br />New song. Not bad.  <br /> <br />DO SOMETHIN'  <br />New song. The second single from the album. Great song.  <br /> <br />Buy this album and enjoy it. With this album, you get a bonus CD with four Britney remixes, and fifth remix, which turns out to be the \\"Chris Cox Megamix\\". The Chris Cox Megamix is actually a medley containing the songs: ...BABYONE MORE TIME/(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY (The Stop! Remix)/I'M A SLAVE 4 U/OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN/STRONGER/EVERYTIME/OVERPROTECTED/TOXIC.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Indeed it is.  Gene Wilder has his place, and you can respect him for that, but Johnny Depp IS Willie Wonka.  Even though he looks alot like Ed Wood... <br /> <br />This film is far better than the original.  It's a better vision of the source material.  The acting's better, the sets are better, the Wonka's better the Charlie's better---- <br /> <br />The Oompa Loompas however...are inferior.  Not a good take on the Oompas.  It's hilarious seeing their origin-story...but making one midget every single Oompa?  Naw.  Gimme my hordes of diverse and pleasantly shaded Oompas with Orville Redenbacher hair.   <br /> <br />The Oompa songs this time around are...interesting.  Maybe I'm a sucker for-- <br />\\"What do you get when you gobble down sweets?\\" <br /> <br />But the contemporary songs used in this film are actually good for a few chuckles. <br /> <br />The Wonka origin-story is a stroke of stylized genius, and I can only feel like Burton is giving us his apologies for \\"Planet of the Apes\\".   <br /> <br />Apology accepted you hairy freak.
B00004SCX6|5.0|1.) Oops! ...I Did It Again - 1st Single <br />Chart Stats: US - #9 / UK - #1 <br />Review: 'OIDIA' is a fun catchy 1st single. The music video gives it flavor also. Very good song.  <br /> <br />2.) Stronger - 3rd Single <br />Chart Stats: US - #11 / UK - #7 <br />Review: This is an independence song. More mature. The music video is amazing.  <br /> <br />3.) Don't Go Knockin' On My Door  <br />Review: Very catchy and a great pop song. <br /> <br />4.) (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction  <br />Review: Britney's 2nd cover. Much better than 'The Beat Goes On' (the cover on her first album). Has an urban flavor. <br /> <br />5.) Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - 4th Single <br />Chart Stats: US - N/A / UK - #12 <br />Review: A very good song. Shania Twain and her husband wrote it. Shania Twain is a great writer and this is a great song and was very under-rated. <br /> <br />6.) What U See (Is What U Get)  <br />Review: This is also a very well- written pop song. <br /> <br />7.) Lucky - 2nd Single <br />Chart Stats: US - #23 / UK: #5 <br />Review: This is a great song. Almost like a popstar anthem. Britney can probably relate to this song. <br /> <br />8.) One Kiss From You  <br />Review: This is a good ballad.  <br /> <br />9.) Where Are You Now  <br />Review: This is one of my all-time favorite Britney songs. I just love how she sings on it and it's so relaxing. <br /> <br />10.) Can't Make You love Me  <br />Review: This is an upbeat song and is different from some of the others. I like it. <br /> <br />11.) When Your Eyes Say It  <br />Review: This is a good pop song. I love how she sings on it. It's a beautiful ballad. <br /> <br />12.) Dear Diary  <br />Review: This is a good song but not Britney's best.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????????? DID THESE GUYS REALLY BREAK UP 27 YEARS AGO?????????? You can't tell it from this album!!!!!! In fact, they sound better than they did in the 60's, because they're no longer fighting, & they're enjoying being together as a cohesive unit. Jack Bruce quickly put to rest any fears I had about his voice being shot. IT'S NOT!!!!!!! It sounds as great as ever, particularly on \\"Sleepy Time Time\\" & \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\", which sound as if the vocal tracks are straight off of the original album! In fact, when you listen to them, there's NO DOUBT that what I've been saying for years is true: THIS IS THE DOGGIE THAT TAUGHT BLACK SABBATH ITS TRICK!!!! His eerily-heavy, creeping bass style hasn't missed a beat, either.Ginger baker's drumming is as awesome & solid as ever too, particularyly when he plays his solo on \\"Toad\\". It leves NO DOUBT that \\"the old man still has heat in his arms\\". His vocals on \\"Pressed Rat & Warthog\\" are awesome, too, sounding alot like Keith Moon's rendition of a creeky old pervert! Now, CLAPTON! WHAT CAN I SAY!!!! Anyone who thinks he sold out & forgot how to play, you've got another thing coming!!!!!!! He tears up the frets on several tracks, especially on \\"Stormy Monday\\", where he delivered the most awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping solo I have EVER heard him play, & that's saying ALOT!!!! After the song ended, Jack Bruce said the only thing there was TO say: \\"Ladies & Gentlemen. It's an honor to play with him. ERIC CLAPTON ON THE GUITAR!!!\\" Now, the only complaint I've heard was that they sold out on \\"Badge\\" & played it the way Clapton plays it solo. I didn't find it at all! There's no synthesizer in place of Bruce's bass, & no extention at the end. But lat's say they had; Originally, this was Clapton's song, not Cream's! Sadly, & ironically, after Jack Bruce's & Ginger Baker's fighting & attempts to one-up each other exploded on stage & turned \\"Crossroads\\" into the immortal classic that it is, they each went off SEPERATELY to record a song in a last ditch effort to save the band. George Harrison, Clapton's best friend, even played the solo on \\"Badge\\". By then, though, Mr. E had had it! Anyway, the point is, if he had wanted to be indulged, he deserved it! As glad as I (& every fan) am that Clapton did this, HE DIDN'T HAVE TO! HE'S A LIVING LEGEND! Now, every die-hard fan feels the same about Bruce & Baker, but to the casual fan, they're just 2 men that used to be in Cream. Now for the bottom line: If you're a fan, or even if you're not, GET THIS!!!! You've been brainwashed long enough. It's time to hear the true genious & musicianship which inspired the watered down \\"rock\\" that has taken over the radio. I promise that once you hear it, you'll be doing like me & praying that these \\"3 old men\\" make a go of it & stay together long term. if they didn't, it would be a crime, & we would ONCE AGAIN be left to dream of what could have been!!!!!!!
0066620996|1.0|Well, I always thought that Good to Great was too good to be true. The author and his team picked several firms that exploded in the late 1980s compared with some selected 'matched' firms that did not do well and tried to identify a set of criteria that they could identify to attribute cause to the effect (success). The problem is that with such retrospective analysis (this would be called a case-control study in clinical research) you can only identify differences and can never attribute cause and effect. These types of studies are inherently poorly resistant to biases inserted by the authors. Typically, they have a preconcieved notion of what they are looking for and then go find it in a self-fulfilling prophesy. This book is no different. The data is from public and published information like SEC reports, other published info, and interviews. The data is pretty subjective.  <br /> <br />I was wondering what happened to some of the \\"great\\" companies compared to the ones that were not great in the same industry (in clinical research, you would always pick two to four comparitor cases, rather than just one, to prevent bias, or to help prevent it). The reason to look was based on my glance at chart on page 2 where it was clear that the \\"great\\" companies were beginning to level off. Now we all know that there was a huge stock boom in the mid- to late- 1990s and that emotion and luck played as much a part in many success stories and were short lived. The book was published in 2001. What happened to those companies? <br /> <br />So here is what I found (the first company is the \\"great\\" one): <br /> <br />Walgreens traded at ~$40 in 2001 and about ~$46 now. Eckerd was purchased by J.C. Penny in 1999 while they were researching the book. Seems to be a crappy comparitor. <br /> <br />Abbott traded at ~$46 in 2001 and about ~$42 now. Pharmacia was purchased by Pfizer in 2000 while the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor. <br /> <br />Circuit City tradedat ~$9 in 2001 and about ~$18 now. Silo went bankrupt in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor. <br /> <br />Kimberly-Clark traded at ~$65 in 2001 and about ~$60 now. Kimberly-Clark bought Scott Paper in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor. <br /> <br />Gillette traded at ~$34 in 2001 and about ~$55 now. Pfizer purchased Warner-Lambert in 2000 as the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor. <br /> <br />Wells Fargo traded at ~$44 in 2001 and about ~$62 now. Bank of America traded at ~$20 in 2001 and about ~$45 now.  <br /> <br />Kroger traded at ~$24 in 2001 and about ~$19 now. A & P (Great A & P Tea) traded at ~$7 in 2001 and about ~$28 now. <br /> <br />Thus, it seems that the attribution of cause and effect to the differences they found was a completely flawed methodology and probably has more complex solutions and reasons. It also shows that the authors had tremendous selection bias and compared the \\"great\\" firms with primarily those firms know to be doomed. Not a fair comparison. The ones that didn't cease to exist seem to be doing as well to day as their \\"great\\" comparitors. <br /> <br />Additionally, most of the concepts are recycled. Not bad ideas, but recycled with different jargon attributed to older ideas. The idea that leaders and managers should focus on what the firm and they do best, what they are passionate about, and what they can achieve rather than what they want to achieve is a great idea, but not new and it sure didn't need to be called the hedgehog concept.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Born To Run, forever a masterpiece in rock music. Now sounding better than ever. Don't believe the negative reviews here. These people are angry or even bitter for the wrong reasons. Who cares if it's Sony, the bottom line is this is Bruce Springsteen and he is the greatest live performer in the history of music. Just watch the DVD. He also happens to be one of the greatest songwriters of all time. He still to this day puts all his heart and sould into his music. Save the negative reviews for those who deserve it. Leave this one a five star. Don't bring the rating down due to your mindless opinions.

B000BJS4OY|5.0|I first saw Bruce in 1977 in Chicago at I believe the Auditorium theater..my fist live concert and having seen Bruce close to 40 times the most memorable because I was so blown away. This whole CD collection is fantastic but for me the Hammersmith concert brings me back to a place I thought I could never go to, back to that first concert when every word he sang he meant and he had that deep throaty wonderful voice that I have never heard matched before. Listen to the piano only thunder road and sandy and you know what I mean. I love tenth avenue, saint in the city (great guitar duel with steve). If your a Bruce fan or not this is a must have and for my money probably the best live music CD I have ever seen (yes it's grainy but so what it's 1975 for gods sake), sonically it's killer 5.1 just superb. The Wings for wheels documentary is excellent with cool studio video etc.<br /><br />Buy it buy it buy it!
B00005OM4N|5.0|1.) I'm A Slave 4 U (The Neptunes) - : This track changed Britney, helped her cross over, and became an instant hit in the US & UK. This 1st single featuring the beats of the Neptunes & Sexy & Sultry lyrics.  <br /> <br />2.) Overprotected (Max Martin & Rami) - : This song expresses Britney being Overprotected and wanting to go just have some fun without having body guards and papparazzi everywhere.  <br /> <br />3.)Lonely (Rodney Jerkins) (Co-Written by Britney) - This is one of my favorite tracks. It has a great beat and good lyrics.  <br /> <br />4.) I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (Max Martin & Rami) (Co-Written by Dido) - : Proved to be more hitworthy in the UK than the U.S. but is still a good track. Britney changes to a woman through this song.  <br /> <br />5.) Boys (The Neptunes) - Another Neptunes track. Very hot. Sexual.  <br /> <br />6.) Anticipating (Brian Kierulf & Josh Schartz) (Co-Written by Britney) - It is fun and makes you wanna dance.  <br /> <br />7.) I love Rock & Roll (Rodney Jerkins) - : This version of ILR&R is very urban and new age.  <br /> <br />8.) Cinderella (Max Martin & Rami) (Co-Written by Britney) - This song is good. Max Martin & Rami are great writers and Britney also co-wrote it. It seems like this song is telling of a new stage in Britney's life.  <br /> <br />9.) Let Me Be (Rodney Jerkins) (Co-Written by Britney) - This track is very independent and Rodney Jerkins does a great job producing it.  <br /> <br />10.) Bombastic Love (Max Martin & Rami) - I love this song. The beat is haunting and cool.  <br /> <br />11.) That's Where You Take Me (Brian Kierulf & Josh Schartz) (Co-Written by Britney) - Not the best track but still a good one. I love her voice in this one.  <br /> <br />12.) What It's Like To Be Me (Wade J. Robson & Justin Timberlake) - This is probably one of the most different tracks on the album. Produced by choreographer: Wade & Ex: Justin. Justin puts his vocals in this. It's good.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|ANNIE is better today than when it came out.  Little Aileen Quinn seems like a real child, and whenever the camera is on her, there's always some real emotion in her face and in her voice.  Her singing voice isn't perfect, but it's real.<br /><br />Too bad the movie doesn't keep its focus on the children more.<br /><br />Carol Burnett is insane in the part of Miss Hannigan, sheer genius, and she staggers, coughs, sucks down booze like Lee Remick in DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.  Every time she sees a man she gets high, her endorphins flying around the room.  She's got to be the easiest girl in town, and she makes it all seem natural.  It's a brave performance, and I notice that when she reforms at the very end John Huston has her do so in miniature, at the bottom of the screen while quarreling with Rooster, almost as if to say, he doesn't believe it either.<br /><br />Most of the numbers are very well done, except perhaps for the bizarre \\"I Think I'm Going To Like It Here\\" sequence.  Sorry, I just don't believe for a minute all those servants cavorting snd dancing with the sheer joy of serving Oliver Warbucks.  It's a spectacle without any foothold in reality.  What are we supposed to think about the plutocratic rich?  My sympathies are with the bearded anarchist who throws the bomb over the balustrade, the assassination attempt thwarted by that darn Sandy.  The whole moral of the story is, as Ann Reinking suggests to Albert Finney, that his priorities aren't correct.  \\"Why do you love only money and power and capitalism?  They'll never love you back.\\"  The truth is, they do love back.  The movie could have shown that capitalism is, not too put too fine a point on it, evil; in fact, viewed at in one way, ANNIE is a spectacular, near Brechtian demonstration of the evil of money.<br /><br />Everyone's very good, excepting perhaps Ann Reinking, who plays the sweet, refined Grace Farrell, Warbucks' secretary.  Reinking is a fine dancer but not a movie star, no way.  Even on stage she seems ill-at-ease.  She was the 70s version of Ann Miller, and both of them hailed from the same Land of Wood.  She's got one number, \\"We Got Annie\\" in which she shows off the dancing Fosse taught her.  Everything else is just splinters.<br /><br />I remember how awful this movie was said to be back in the day, but give it a shot, there are some wonderful elements to it, and dream of the day when we can see it wide screen to appreciate the inventive choreography in the \\"Hard Knock Life\\" number, which looks so difficult and anarchic.  If this isn't John Huston's very best film it's in my top 3 or 4 by him.  Is that impossible to imagine?ven on stage she seems ill-at-ease.

0307276902|5.0|Have you ever read a book that was so vivid with imagery your stomach turned, your heart raced and your eyes actually had to leave the pages to get back to your own world and escape the reality of the words in front of you?  This book offers all of that and more.   <br /> <br />It is a story of addiction -- a deep harrowing addiction that almost cost James Frey his life.  You wonder how on earth does someone get to this point?  How do you end up on this spiral staircase of self destruction and then how the heck to you rise above it?   <br /> <br />This book was just what I needed for a little perspective and reminder that we all can overcome our worst habits and become better human beings...if we just hold on.  <br /> <br />It is a real story - with f words and hatred and impurity and selfishness and his version of hell.  But as they say, if you're going through hell, keep going...and James Frey does just that with you along for the ride.
0553801503|4.0|Having read most of the reviews, I think it's important to consider this novel's place in the series' milieu. The problem most people who didn't enjoy the book seem to bring up is that \\"not much happens.\\" This is an accurate assessment. Pound for pound, there is not as much going on in the foreground of this book as there has been in the previous novels.  <br /> <br />However, one has to remember what has passed to this point. Royalty and commoners have been killed by the thousands, and the resulting desolation across Westeros is the focus of this novel. The emptiness of the land is palpable. This is the long autumnal dusk before the impending snows. We must remember that this is a time of sorrow and of opportunism. No great battles should or even could be fought. This is an exhausted people, stuggling now against the real enemy - the comming winter. <br /> <br />This is not a novel that bends to the whim of the reader. It is instead one that spends some of the capital that the series has earned to this point, demanding that the reader pay careful attention to the little breadcrumbs that Martin lays along the way. Hints about the location of Tyrion, the plottings of the Dornish throne (including the identity of the betrayer), and the fate of the members of the Brotherhood provide delicious morsels for those willing to invest the time and patience into the book. And more, Martin (I expects) demands the attention of the readers to the rich tapestry of royalty, to their individual interests, and to their plans for the future. Without such understanding, the later activities will seem so much random action, rather than what they are - the inevitable result of careful and considered plotting by the cast of thousands.  <br /> <br />The novel is not a feast for lovers of high drama and fast paced action. Instead, it is a mournful sigh, taken after untold bloodshed with the knowledge that there is only more bloodshed to come. Its characters are unspeakably sad, nearly voidof hope, yet knowing they must rise if they are to survive the coming winter. <br /> <br />I will not say it is my favorite of the series. More than once I've remarked that it is, at times, more like reading an encyclopedia than a novel. It was not uncommon to cross-reference some name or description with something somewhere else in the book or even in one of the previous books. My advice to the reader - get used to it. There is so much going on in this book just out of the sight of the characters. The smart reader will realize when Martin is dropping hints that you should give further thought to what is really going on. Anyone can easily devour and enjoy the other books in this series. It will take especially studious readers to appreciate this novel to the same degree. In its place, it is an appropriately somber addition to the world of Westeros and will, I think, when viewed against the series as a whole, be seen for what it is, for what it must be - the dark quiet moment before the the storm.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have been a fan of Madonna's for over twenty years now and have stuck with her through thick and thin.    <br /> <br />While 2003's American Life was lambasted, I still enjoyed about 75% of the album,  but still.. she was in dire need of a new direction.  What critics adored about Ray Of Light, they found pretentious and boring in American Life.   So Madonna did something a lot of longtime fans have been secretly wishing from her but figuring would never happen... she's gone back to her roots. <br /> <br />I don't know how any fan of dance-pop can not worship this album.   I have friends who haven't liked her since Erotica that are in love with this album.  Granted, don't expect blockbuster status from this album, when the radio keeps shoving hip hop down your ears (it's great to hear a diva doing a dance album again, after the likes of J. Lo and Mariah have been overdoing the hip hop thing), this will likely only appeal to dance fans and Madonna-heads, but it's worth a check if you're one of either. <br /> <br />This is one of Madonna's most irresistable records and if you're one of those fans from the 80's and early 90's who lost interest in Madonna because \\"she became pretentious and boring\\",  you can rest easier because the pretention is gone and she is having more fun than she's had on any album since True Blue. <br /> <br />This album will never replace the masterpiece that is Like A Prayer, but it's still perhaps the easiest Madonna album to get into in over a decade.   She is back and she will always be the queen of pop! <br /> <br />PS, what's the point of even trashing this album and then saying \\"if you want REAL music, go buy the new live Cream cd\\",  there's nothing in common.  If you were going to make a point about buying the latest from Barbra Streisand or Shakira or Cyndi Lauper instead of this, it would make a little more sense, because Madonna fans are more likely to like those instead.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mariah, in her never-ending attempt to stay relevant, has re-released her insipid EMANCIPATION CD. Why? Don't ask me....I'm just as confused about it as most people. It was trite to begin with, and re-releasing it only shows her chronic desperation to sell more records to be deemd worthy of \\"pop star status\\". Word to Mariah - get over it. Your work will speak for itself, and given that most of your older work is forgotten, you don't have much to say. <br /> <br />Save your money and buy MADONNA's CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR - it is a far better CD release.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|1. Me Against the Music -Britney creates a new genre here which i heard is refered to as \\"edgy pop.\\" Whatever you call it though, its a sexy, club beat dance song that her and Madonna did a wonderful job of singing and co-writing together on.  <br /> <br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom -This song features the Ying Yang twins who spice up the song with some rap/hiphop. It's a fun, club song. Something different for her fans. Britney is forever reinventing herself.  <br /> <br />3. Showdown -Britney reinventing herself into a mature adult reflects even more on track 3. A sexy song, about teasing someone back and forth. Her vocals sound very lush and whispery.  <br /> <br />4. Breathe On Me -One of the best tunes on the cd. Something else you can definetly see yourself dancing to in clubs. Its about a relationship so hot, they dont even need to touch just breathe.  <br /> <br />5. Early Mornin' -A song about the morning after a fun night of partying. There is also some rap added here in the chorus making this an awesome dance song.  <br /> <br />6. Toxic -How can you not like this single? There is a rare violin thing going on in the song, with a catchy beat, about an toxic love you can't get enough of. One of Britney's best.  <br /> <br />7. Outrageous -A little laugh at the media here. Telling them \\"if you dont like it well then...La la la la\\" A great dance song that R-Kelly wrote for her with some funky dance beats in it.  <br /> <br />8. Touch of My Hand - a song about \\"self love,\\" shocking, but done tastefully which again, reflects Britney's maturity as a person. The ballad is also softer.  <br /> <br />9. The Hook Up -a song about simply feeling confident, and having a great time, \\"hooking up,\\" on the dance floor. The beat is sensational. A really good track here...  <br /> <br />10. Shadow -Britney now switches to a softer ballad. A metaphor of someone who never reveals their true self, only their shadow. Her vocals and songwriting here are simply outstanding. If itwas relased, it would have been a huge hit.  <br /> <br />11. Brave New Girl -a very poppy song i liked right away. A song about finding yourself, feeling confident and sexy, and knowing what you want in life.  <br /> <br />12. Everytime -A beautiful ballad where she really shows off her vocals, with a music box beat to it. It's such a sad song, but its also very beautiful. My favorite song on here.  <br /> <br />13. Me Against the Music Remix -a fantasitc remix! I almost like it better then the first. Rarely do remixes sound this good. I'm glad Britney decided to put this on here.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is Britney's best cd yet. She experiments with many different types of music on here: dance pop, hiphop/rap, and even some bits of techno, r&b, and country you can catch in here. She also trys out her vocals in many different forms, and her voice just becomes more and more talented. However, this is a much more mature cd, more for adults then little kids i would say. Britney has grown up so it is to be expected, but i highly reccommed picking up this cd today. Its a great dance, feel good cd, and really does get you in the zone, making you feel energetic, and good about yourself.
B000002LGQ|5.0|like a prayer is undoubtedly madonna's best album.  the album displays a maturity of her songwriting.  madonna sings about her personal life and her personal views, put to pop music mostly played by live instruments.  sometimes light, sometimes heavy, sometimes serious, sometimes fun, like a prayer is where madonna bared her soul, and we get to see more of this after this album.  this was a clear turning point in her career, where she pushed herself to the limit and gained respect for it.  <br /> <br />after 15 years, this album certainly deserves a remastered release, and hopefully an expanded version which would include the 7\\" versions of its singles - like a prayer, express yourself, cherish and keep it together, which was released in different versions from the album tracks.  some of these 7\\" versions aren't available on cd.  of course, there's also that track supernatural which appeared on the european single cherish.  since her first 3 albums had received the remastered treatment, this cd should receive that treatment.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna was never gone, but she is back stronger than before. She's here to show us that she's got it. The brilliant Hung Up to the spiritual Isaac make you wanna get up and dance.  I was at work yesterday and after listening to it I could not stop moving and trying to sing.   Its amazing that after 22 years, she can still show us who the real Queen on the dance floor is. Buy it, and I promise you, that you will not be dissapointed.    <br /> <br />Get ready to put on your dancing shoes:P
B000000W5N|5.0|The Rolling Stones had established themselves as a sorta successor to The Beatles when they hit it big in the mid to late 60's.  They were the most popular rock group, second only to The Beatles themselves.  They had a stream of hit records including, \\"Aftermath\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\", and \\"Beggar's Banquet\\".  As the 60's ended and the 70's began they both redefined their sound and resurrected old ideas for their next hit album, \\"Sticky Fingers\\". <br /> <br />The album covers alot: blues, country, folk, pop, Rock & Roll, and even some jazz-rock.  Mick Jagger's vocals ring out just as well as on any of their earlier albums.  Keith Richards turns out guitar riffs just as well as Hendrix or Page and Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts remain one of the more distinct rhythm sections at that time.  The album covers many topics including drugs, interracial sex, missed love ones, and world beauty. <br /> <br />The first thing you hear when you play the record is one of the most recognizable guitar riffs in rock history.  \\"Brown Sugar\\",  is a riff driven tale about slavery in the South and relationships with African American Women.  \\"Wild Horses\\", is the Stones at their best when it comes to country-rock.  A beautiful number about life on the road and missed love ones at home.  \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\",  is an ode to sex containing one of the Stones longest and almost jazz like jams.  The song, \\"Bitch\\", is a mean little ditty and one of the more destructive tunes the Stone's have done.  \\"I Got The Blues\\",  is the Stones at their best when it comes to blues rock and, \\"Sister Morphine is a frightening tale of a drug overdose.  The album ends with the string driven ballad, \\"Moonlight Mile\\", one of the most beautiful songs the Stones have done. <br /> <br />This is rock at its best so if you don't know the Rolling Stones' music this is a good place to start.  Get away from MTV and listen to some classic rock that doesn't have images of guys riding around in low riders and picking up prostitutes.  It may be a change but its worth the while.
0743243315|4.0|There is some kind of resentiment towards any kind of modern discourse, especially one considering gender roles, and multiculturalism, but somehow I stumbled upon this book (don't remember was it actually recommended to me or I just picked it of the shelf but it really isn't so much important).<br /><br />Monica Ali is considered to be one of the most promising authors of  \\"female\\" and \\"cultural\\" discourse writing in english language today. That kind of tagline, which imposes itself every time you hear or talk about Monica Ali, a priori clouds ones judgement, and somehow, you just cannot read book without that kind of narrow view.<br /><br />But, if you manage to find your way trough very popular modern custom of putting everything in the same bag, you'll find very challenging book, which challenges mostly by its deep sence for its characters, which live their own life full of misery and pain. Though somewhat black and white (especially her male characters) and much influenced by some kind of forced struggle towards human rights and intercultural empathy, Brick Lane is very fluentous book in a way of not having an aggressive discourse, thus not forcing its reader to challenge every sentence written there.<br /><br />Maybe somewhat naive in a last few chapters, where \\"western spirit\\" finally finds its way trough mists of tradition, this book gives its reader fair ammount of intelectual and moral puzzle which became very dominant in last few years.<br /><br />While its romanesque form may suffer for that, it is unfair to judge Monica Ali as an \\"unworthy writer\\" that slides with the tides of her time.<br /><br />This is the book, which will keep ocupied every reader out there,  a bit longer than just one reading.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|The production is bad, the sound quality is VERY-cheap, sometimes you can't hear what MC is pronouncing because of it. <br /> <br />Also, it's one giant ball of the same old song from 15 years ago, creativity isn't inside the minde on Boriah Scarey. <br /> <br />Buy J'Lo instead. True RnB and hip-hop
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to say that I have been a HUGE Madonna fan since 1989.  I love everything she has ever done.  After the Immaculate Collection, I didnt think there could be anything else better than that, but guess what?  I was wrong!  COAD is the best she's done, and if you give it a shot and try it out you'll agree.

B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm gonna start by saying that The Emancipation of Mimi is one of Mariah's best albums! From start to finish, and she sounds awesome. Say what you want people she's one of the best selling artists of all time! But I must address and ask why are people comparing her to Madonna, there talents are so different. True I love Mariah, but I have alot of respect for Madonna as an artist. I just don't understand, there sounds are nothing similar, and people saying one is better than the other is ridiculous!  <br />Madonna ruled the 80's <br />Mariah ruled the 90's
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought Chariot a year ago, only knowing two songs; I Don't Wanna Be and Follow Through. I didn't know what to expect from the album, but after only listening to it once, I was already falling in love with the album. 11 beautifully written songs, sung by a sexy, raspy and beautiful voice, it soon became my favourite album and I am still listening to it regularly.. The songs are all meaningful, soulful and you can really feel the emotion behind his lyrics. (Don't listen to people who call the lyrics lame!)  <br />It's very hard to pick a favourite song from the album as all the songs are beautiful. Overall, Gavin DeGRAW is a sensational singer/songwriter/musician and anyone thinking of buying the album, I recommend you to buy it because you won't regret it!!!!!! <br />
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I love it!! Her 4 new songs on this album aren't just some cheaply thrown together songs added to the end of the CD, I actually love all 4 of them!!! <br />The DVD is a nice little bonus, it's nice to have all her videos on one DVD.  <br />My daughter can't stop watching it!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|ITS SO AWESOME AND I LIKE THE BEAT, FAVORITE SONGS SO FAR ARE: HUNG UP, SORRY, I LOVE NEW YORK AND ISAAC. THIS LAST SONG IS SO AMAZING, SPIRITUAL AND MAKES ME DANCE. I WISS ALL THE SONG WOULD BE RELEASE AS SINGLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I will resume all the album in just one word (and it's what the music industry NEEDS right now). <br /> <br />Fresh
B000002URV|5.0|Everybody knows Enigma....even if they don't `know' it.  The music from Michael Cretu's little project has sold more than 30 million records (MCMXC a.D. alone sold 15 million worldwide and was in the Billboard Top 200 for 5 years!), and has been used everywhere from TV ads and programs to films; listening to this will provoke many \\"This sounds familiar...\\"-type reactions.  <br />This surprise hit just wasn't a success at selling albums: it's also successful at being bloody brilliant! After a rather eye-rolling introduction in which a woman informs us that \\"over the next hour, you will journey into a world of music, spirit and meditation\\", over some aloof synths, the album hits its stride with the absolutely cracking, multi-platinum single `Sadeness'. This song - with its homage to sexual deviant, Marquis de Sade - places a Latin male choir chanting over a killer beat and pan-pipes while a woman breathes heavily as the song reaches a climax after a spoken French verse. The expertise with which all these samples are mixed together is stunning and it creates the definite highlight of the album.  <br />The themes brought up by this song, of the duality and conflict of sexual freedom and religion, continue throughout the rest of the album, which is split into three sections, the first dealing mainly with the sexual side. The second section tones that down and Cretu manages to throw in a tribute to Maria Callas in the soothing `Callas Went Away' before the soft percussion of that song gives way to the stomping `Mea Culpa'. More samples come in with the arrival of `The Voice and the Snake'; a short, ritualistic piece that goes on about the apocalypse that would sound quite frightening with the lights switched off. <br />The last section of the album goes into themes of redemption. It starts very low-key with `Way to Eternity' before the beat from `Sadeness' returns in `Hallelujah', building up into the uplifting `Rivers of Belief'.  <br />This isn't an album that you'll like in your first listen. It isn't as immediate as Enigma's later records, but it is their tightest, most consistent work. If there is any weakness is that a lot of tracks would lose most of their impact if listen to individually instead of in context with the rest of the album. But I suppose that isn't really a negative, it just means that you'll have to listen to the album in order as the tracks all flow into each other seamlessly.  <br />On a finally note, make sure you get this `limited edition' with the `extra tracks' - they're really just remixes, but the remix for `Find Love' dramatically improves over the mediocre original. <br />
B0002OERI0|3.0|As a rule of thumb, I never buy albums which get played on the radio. What's the point in buying those CDs if they get played on the radio ALL THE TIME anyway? Plus, 99.99% of them are crap. However, this album falls in the remaining 0.01% category. Even though this album too was over-played on the radio, I actually liked them enough to buy it. <br /> <br />I don't wish to offend die-hard green day fans, but the band is not very talented-musically at least. However, what I really liked about the album was the lyrics. I've been sooo bombarded with songs with cheesy lyrics about sex, the description of various parts of the female anatomy and how the singer wants to see a woman move them around (I live in Chicago), that anything with mature, real-world lyrics qualifies as a good thing. The lyrics of the album are just that. I also agree with the perspective of the lyrics about the average American life. I am actually glad that there are others who think the way that I do. <br /> <br />To sum it up, compared to some classic rock songs and the works of a few legendary bands that still put out excellent albums (and never get played on the radio), this album does not offer much in terms of musicianship. However, the lyrics stand out on their own making this album worth your hard earned money.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I like Madonna for always trying something new, but I was very disappointed with this album, I wasn't too fond of \\"Hung Up\\" but I thought I'd take my chances, just didn't impress me much
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I find it very interesting after reading almost half of these reviews that people who do like this album write full reviews while the rest of the biggots who write bad ones write quick and untastefull, and not mention short and small reviews.  It seems that these people dont listen to real dance music and the first group that pops into their mind when they hear the words dance music or techno, is postal service.  Madonna has come out with a well worthy dance album, everyone seems to be saying that William Orbit is a better producer then Stuart Price. Hes not.  Stuart price ripped a new one in Mr. Brightside and brought the smash hit Avalon to the lime light.  If you think Orbit is a better producer then you probablly think that Oakenfold is still trance.  Hung up is an amazing song and eversong after is just as good.  All the songs ranging from progressive to electro house even some disco house in the mix. <br />Its to bad that America can't keep up with the rest of the world in realizing that dance music is alot more then oakenfold, prodigy, and postal service-which isnt even dance music.  Oh and by the way TECHNO is its own genre. The style that all of you are refering to is called electronic.  But I guess you wouldnt know that since the last thing you listened to was simple plan.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Alot of people have told me they really can't stand this movie, but I don't get angry at them at all, this movie is not for everybody, in fact, it's for a select few. There are those of us who are just sick to death of big Hollywood romantic comedies......In this we get Napoleon and Deb, two kids who really dig each other (I think) but never hold hands, kiss, or anything, now how much of a nice change is that? no stupid fighting. no boring love scene, no dumb family banter, just two kids tryin' to make it through high school. Then there are also those of us who are sick of the big Hollywood comedies that are never as funny as advertised or previewed. In Napoleon we get hilarious lines and situations you would least expect and takes 2-3 viewings before you can catch all the jokes.<br /><br />I have seen this over 20 times (we watch it at work all the time) and I still stop what I'm doing several times to watch some of my favorite scenes. How about the big dance number towards the end? If you like this movie you know every time that comes on, you're gonna be watching every second of it. Then there is the school dance where Napoleon gets ditched by the popular girl, but does get to dance with Deb and tells her he likes her sleeves, cuz there poofy.<br /><br />Napoleon's best friend is a winner as well, Pedro runs for class president and actually wins thanks to Napoleon, but his best scene is where he organizes a picnic and they bash a pinata shaped like his opponents head (the most popular girl in school. Summer)<br /><br />All these actores are no-namers, but most will soon be huge, I've heard rumors that they might make a sequel, which would be great fun, hopefully all the cast will be back.<br /><br />You just gotta love Brother Kip and Uncle Rico, Kip is in love with his chat room buddy and Rico is a get-rich-quick schemer who is stuck in the 80's, so much that he orders a time machine that Napoleon unfortunately finds out the hard way that it does not work.<br /><br />Watch this people, alot of reviewers have dogged it big-time, but it's really funny, very charming and characters you're just going to love.<br /><br />acting........4 stars, Young cast is brilliant<br />directing.....4.5 stars, So much out of so little.....<br />special effects....N/A, Except for maybe Rico's time machine..lol<br />comedy rating....4 stars, Many laughs, some very, very funny<br />quality.......4 stars, Looks great, feels even betterwers have dogged it big-time, but it's really funny, very charming and characters you're just going to love.    acting........4 stars, Young cast is brilliant  directing.....4.5 stars, So much out of so little.....  special effects....N/A, Except for maybe Rico's time machine..lol  comedy rating....4 stars, Many laughs, some very, very funny  quality.......4 stars, Looks great, feels even better
1573223026|4.0|More often than not a book about suicide would either take the subject head on and gouge you to death with its morbidity or, on the other hand, it would faintly deal with the subject in an indirect way, not digging in with enough real details about suicide to matter.  Hornby's book deals directly with the subject but doesn't let the characters problems fester into hopelessness or utter despair.  It is more like these \\"suicidal\\" characters remind us a bit of ourselves or people we know.  Of course, Hornby infuses the novel with the patented touches of pop culture that we fans expect from him.  Particularly funny is his portrayal of the American JJ, who seems to stand for the good (how Hornby views American culture) and the bad (how Europe views the US government and Americans abroad) about the USA.  The character of Martin has all the zingers as the TV personality gone bad and he is the foil for the book's scene-stealer Jess, a foul-mouthed young woman who speaks first and thinks later, if at all.  I agree that the fourth character of Maureen is pulled off wonderfully by Hornby.  She is a prim devout Catholic woman in her fifties with a disabled son.  This character seems to be nothing like any character Hornby has ever written about - she's old, unhip, knows nothing of culture or music.  However, he shares something in common with her; Hornby also has a disabled child.  Knowing that tidbit of information before reading made Maureen's presence in the book all the more illuminating.
B000002KKS|5.0|Dio has made Black Sabbath good. With Ozzy it wasn't so good. Ozzy is a bad singer. But Ronnie James Dio is the best singer of the world! So buy this album and enjoy it, ignore the bad review of 'Sponge Bob killer'! This album is the best album Black sabbath has ever done. They could not have done it without DIO!
0385491026|5.0|I picked up Cat's Eye because I was so consumed by the characterization in The Robber Bride.  Imagine a novel which could transport me beyond my strong emotions for the characters in The Robber Bride.  Our heroine, Elaine, was a drifter in early elementary school, until she become involved in a clique of girls lead by Cordelia.  The pain Cordelia inflicts on the young Elaine is insufferable (but Elaine desperately wanted her approval), and in many ways, it will remind most readers of at least portions of their school-years experiences.<br /><br />The story of Cat's Eye is told in the present tense, when Elaine is a successful artist, and the school-year times with Cordelia are told as flashbacks.  This helps the reader, because they know that Elaine survived the torment to make something of her life.  Personally, I adore Elaine as an icon, because she sees her works as pieces of art, not as the feminist icons that her fans want to define her by.  I wonder how much of Elaine's sentiment about being a reluctant feminist icon reflects Atwood's true feelings about how her literary works are interpreted.<br /><br />Overall, this is a brilliant literary masterpiece, especially for any woman who experienced elementary and junior high school at the hands of a clique of girls.  Highly recommended-this is powerful stuff.
B0006B29WA|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the single best album of 2004. And NOT because of their 2 hits- \\"Take Me Out\\" and \\"This Fire.\\"    The album is great because it's almost a re-invention of indie rock. Franz has such a unique indie sound that one can't help but be drawn in. After \\"Take Me Out\\" hit such high heights, I decided to check the album out... and to my initial surprise, I was absolutely blown away. I dare a true rock fan to listen to the album and find even ONE bad song.     Franz is also an interesting band because of their lyrics- one song can have entirely one dimensional (and rather repetitive) lyrics, while the next song will have true meaning. If you want songs with great lyrics definitely check out \\"The Dark of the Matinee\\" (my personal favorite song on the album) and \\"Come On Home.\\" Those songs have some true feeling.    The rhythms of EVERY song are just great. They really make you want to move and (for me) they just make you so happy. It really is a cheer-you-up kind of album.     While I am certainly not trying to present Franz as some kind of earth-shattering new sound/band/movement- I AM saying this is just a great listen. Their unique sound has given me new hope in indie rock (along with a great band named Kasabian- check them out, too) and I can tell they have some staying power (check out Franz's new album- You Could Have It So Much Better- it's also great, even though it sounds similar to this one).   So, if you've only heard their singles and hits, check out the whole album- it'll be a pleasant surprise. I know it was for me.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I am a Dance Fan and serious Lover of Groove Armada..Noow, this stuff is just plain Crap..Do Not waste your money..It sounds just like something made in a basement. Hung Up is a decent song, but like most are saying, I to am outraged at the Blatant stealing of the ABBA sample..Shame on you madonna..your throne has not only been abdicated, but you are an 80's foot note now.
B000002KDO|1.0|this is a bad album to be honest. I own 4 albums of 'Black Sabbath': Master of Reality, Heaven And Hell, Mob Rules and Dehumanizer. I like them all, except for Master of Reality. The singer called Ozzy is a bad singer and some songs of this album sound really stupid. Don't buy this album. Buy Heaven And Hell, Mob Rules and Dehumanizer from Black Sabbath. On those albums sings my favorite singer called Ronnie James Dio!
B00005JNQS|2.0|Robots wasn't as good as I thought it would. From the previews it looked pretty good. First off it is too short but for an animated kids film I guess I can understand. The film was cute but it wasn't all that funny. The voice talents are good especially Robin Williams but the overall film to me just wasn't all that good.
B000002GVO|5.0|The people who gave this album \\"OMG WORST ALBUM EVAR!!!11\\" type reviews are just trolls.  Ignore them.  The others do a little better and criticize the music style, which is at least a legit complaint.  To them I say that Hotel California is great not for the music in of itself, but for the lyrics and attitudes expressed in the music and the lyrics.  I would liken in to comparing Led Zeppelin to Pink Floyd; Zep tended to have the better tunes musically, but Floyd blew them away when it came to lyrics and albums on a whole.  To those too simple minded to understand that a song does not have to just 'sound good' to be great, I am sorry.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I can't believe I actually wasted my money on this, the 4 new tracks are horrible, you get a recycled remix of We Belong Together, 2 BAD new tracks and the newest single Don't Forget About Us which sounds like We Belong Together part 2, the song is tanking BIG TIME because of that fact.  Mariah is really trying to milk everything she can out of this album, I do love the orginal release and would give that release 4 stars but there is no reason to buy this version if you have the original.
B000002L7V|5.0|I love this album very much, I think this album is even better then 'The Last In Line'! Not as good as 'Holy DIver', but very good. My second favorite album from DIO!

B000B5UL7G|1.0|Where do I start with the phenomenon that is Robbie Williams?  First of all he was part of a five man cheesy pop group that few people care about anymore. Then he wasted a few years drinking. Following that he released tat after tat into the charts. Then, out the blue someone wrote him a song called Angels that captured the hearts of divorced women all over the UK. After that he was on the pop music gravy train for good, and couldn't be stopped!  No matter how many awful singles and albums he produced, the low self esteemed public lapped it up because \\"Robbie has attitude\\", or \\"He is sexy\\", etc. I disagree, he is an egotistical buffoon with delusions of talent. He can't sing, write or even converse in a legible manner. Listening to him talk in an interview is like listening to a child attempt to explain the mysteries of the universe. He is clueless!  Since his record company wasted millions on his contract they have had no choice but to pump out album, after album, after live show, after DVD, after charity appearance, and on it goes.  I am ashamed to be considered part of the music buying British public.  Have you ever heard a serious and respected recording artist say they like Robbie Williams' music?  No, of course not.  Ironically it seems he couldn't care less about the British public as he spends so much time mooching around the USA hoping to be recognised. He claims that he doesn't care about breaking the American music market. He might not, but his record company do!  Robbie is a tragic pop accident, he even takes himself seriously.  How any one person could be so deluded to think they have a talent for song is beyond me.  In fifty years time the true musical classics will still be played by people all over the globe, any dross from Robbie will be recycled into something more useful, like a sink plug.  This album is much the same as the rest of his output, a mash of confused lyrics and nonsense synthesised backing tracks.  Robbie Williams remains the most overrated performer on the planet. I would rather listen to David Hasselhoff for24 hours non stop than five minutes of this album.  Terrible from start to finish, especially so when Robbie tries to rap.errated performer on the planet. I would rather listen to David Hasselhoff for24 hours non stop than five minutes of this album.  Terrible from start to finish, especially so when Robbie tries to rap.
B00006CXXU|4.0|When Christina Aguilera marked her return with her first single, \\"Dirrty\\", I felt that she really came back swinging. Even with the video, it was noticed those days when she was just a \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" singing \\"What A Girl Wants\\" were over and she was at a totally new phase in her life and career. With her album \\"Stripped\\", this shows her going eclectic and the only thing that I can say about it is that she made the wise decision to go there. There is so much depth incorporated in many of the lyrics featured on this album that it can empower every man, woman, and child who are dealing with any of the situations she is singing about. In my opinion, some of the best songs on here are \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Loving Me For Me\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Make Over\\", \\"Dirrty\\"(of course), \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"I'm OK\\" and \\"Singing My Song\\". This album is worth a listen.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I got SOAD tickets and noticed that two bands: Hella, Hella and The Mars Volta were the opening acts.  I'd never heard of either so I browsed the internet and found The Mars Volta.  I tripped around their site, listened to a couple of the tracks and though there were some odd effects and bridges there was a quality in the nuances that made it very appealing.  When I arrived at the concert and saw them play I was blown away.  They were so $^~#!#% unbelievable live that I knew I was really hearing and watching my new favorite band for the first time and it was live and LOUD and I was loving it.  They ROCKED! SOAD was awesome too, but this band just blind sided my synapses.  I immediately ran out to get everything I could and began to wrap my head around De-Loused in the Comatorium.  The music is so completely unique and different than anything I've ever heard.  Unbelievably talented musicianship and songwriting make this album an undisputed new rock \\"Masterpiece\\" from my perspective.  This album contains a seemless blending of different musical genre, haunting, melodic hooks that keep drawing you back in for more, along with odd, yet appropriate sound effects that tie transitions together.  Absolutely remarkable quality.  The guitarist Omar is truly gifted, and Cedric's voice is explosive, even Flea appears on the album and has some very awesome and unforgettable bass riffs, especially on track 10 Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt.  Some of the standout tracks to me are track 9 Televators (haunting), Track 10, Track 7 Cicatriz ESP and the blend of 4 Tira Me a Las Aranas with 5 Drunkship of Lanterns but I love the whole album.  A truly talented group of musicians that hopefully will collaborate for years to come.  If you are starving for some quality and gifted talent this album is a MUST that will satisfy your appetite.  A MUST for any music aficionado.  5 out of 5 stars all the way.
B000BGH22W|5.0|And Again...This Score is Perfect!Ok there will always be a spacial place in my heart for William's Scores...but still this one is EXCELLENT!The only problem that i find is that we will never find out if Williams would have done a better job(i believe so).That is really sad.Bat as a pure Harry Potter FAN all i have to say to all others is,listen to the last two minutes of the 18 track(Voldemort) and just imagine Harry's parents ,Harry escaping from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...MY GOD!I get Goosbumps....(another sad thing is that we didn't hear the Phoenix theme at this part but anyway...)
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Great album.  Great energy!  One of her best dance albums ever.  Get Together, Sorry, and Jump are sure-fire Top 20 hits.  Isaac is amazing and haunting.  Let It Will Be and Forbidden Love are both tranquil and beautiful. <br /> <br />Her voice is raw and more powerful than ever.  Madonna truly is an artist that gets better with time.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|It's not artist-like to re-release an album and even less when EVERY SINGLE SONG depends on backing vocals from featured artists, this woman is only behind Ciara in the \\"feature another artist cheap thingy\\". <br /> <br />Definitely C H E A P, bad quality production, it sounds like it has been recorded under the sea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Unlike Jennifer Lopez's VERY good album.
0393317552|4.0|This history book was so good that it made my head hurt---and I was okay with that.  Before you buy it---and I strongly recommend that you do---be forewarned, however, that the type is small, the text is thick, to fully grasp the sentences may require re-reading them three times, and the book is a lengthy one.  This is not summer reading material and it is definitely not a vacation read.  This is truly a tome (and if you don't know what tome means, then do what your parents told you: look it up) and you best bring your 'A' game when you sit down to enjoy it.    Oh, by the way, a number of reviewers perceive a bias in this work.  In fact, one reviewer went so far as to put in the following in their Amazon review:    \\"Diamond plants these doubts [regarding the bias that Diamond is perceived to have causing the reviewer to have doubts about Diamond's objectivity] through his sometimes-careless prose. Consider the following statement, which he includes in the introduction to his chapter on the rise of food production:    'My fellow farmhands were, for the most part, tough whites whose normal speech featured strings of curses, and who spent their weekdays working so that they could devote their weekends to squandering their weeks' wages in the local saloon. Among the farmhands, though, was a member of the Blackfoot Indian tribe named Levi, who behaved very differently from the coarse miners - being polite, gentle, responsible, sober, and well spoken'    I thought for a moment that I'd wandered into the script for \\"Dances With Wolves.\\" Note that had this statement been turned on it's head (had he, for example, recounted an anecdote about \\"fire-water drinking Indian drunks\\" or \\"lazy black layabouts\\") my instincts, obviously, would immediately warn me that the author's biases might be influencing how he chooses to present the evidence. I myself am a Black American, I'm all too painfully aware that we've had to wade through some pretty grim stuff penned by authors clutchingat straws to support their racist white supremacist views of the world. In this case Diamond does the reverse by aiming his negative bias towards Caucasians, but if I'm truly interested in unbiased science then my skepticism should remain the same.\\"     Well, I, too, am an African-American and my in-depth response is that the reviewer has completely taken the initial quote from Diamond out of context, left out a subsequent critical reference to Levi from the same chapter, and drawn a conclusion from this quote that is patently incorrect (which indicates some type of bias on behalf of the reviewer, doesn't it?).  The Levi reference the reviewer does not mention is that later in the chapter Diamond says that Levi also disappointed Diamond by coming in early one Sunday morning as drunk and disheveled as the other whites Diamond describes.  And the whole reason Diamond brings all of this up is to set-up and share a quote from the drunk Levi which basically says \\"Dang you Caucasians and the ship that brought you from Switzerland to my ancestral land\\".  Then Diamond uses that as a launching off point to go on and ask a fundamental question: why was it that the Europeans came to the New World and why didn't New World natives explore Europe?  This is a key question for the whole book and an excellent one.  The rest of Guns, Germs, and Steel then goes on to explore in depth why was it this way, which, as you will read, has virtually nothing to do with race, ethnicity, genetics, or the like.    My off-hand response to this type of comment (i.e. reviewers in general trying to say there is a bias in this work) is (heavy sarcasm): \\"Gee, a book that has a point of view to it. Man, that never happens.\\"  Get over it people.  Every thing ever written reflects the perspective, either overtly shared or not, of the author.  For goodness sakes, we don't let that prevent us from reading the newspaper including the editorial pages or watching television shows so please don't let that stand in your way of reading this book.    So, in short, skip the PBS special, buy the book, do your full ocular muscle training first, then begin your read and be ready to be thoroughly intellectually challenged. Oooh, my grey matter still aches---but in a good way!
B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, \\"ever since I saw Batman Begins\\" and find his artistic vision to be incredible. <br /> <br />The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice. <br /> <br />However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this.
B00006LI26|5.0|This debut cd from, in my opinion, Gods of speed metal.  Their signer, which is now with gamma ray, delivers very hardcore sounding vocals.  Thier bassist is incredible and is backed up with some incredible guitar riffs and duets.  Make sure you get this cd with the extra track judas because the song is well worth it.  With great songs such as stralight, warrior, gorgar, and judas, this is a must have for your metal collection.  Don't be mistaken though, the other songs rock to.  You will fall in love with this cd istantly.  If you like iron maiden but you also like a little more edge to your music, look no further.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Let me say that I am mostly an Alternative listener. I am not by any means a fan of techno or dance. I, however, dig artists who stay true to themselves and that have shaped music into what it is today.  Because of that, pop artists like Michael Jackson and MADONNA will always have my attention.  I have to admit... when \\"Hung Up\\" came out, I wasn't blown away.  I did like it, but I wasn't crazy about it.  Then, I popped this record in and listened all the way through.  I was blown away.  The production is cool, Madonna's voice couldn't sound better, and each message that the songs offer (whether it be superficial fun or touching spiritual wise) are STRONG.  Key tracks are \\"Unforbidden Love,\\" \\"Jump,\\" \\"Isaac,\\" and \\"I Love New York.\\"  Even if you aren't a fan of Pop or Dance, check this out.  Let it be a guilty pleasure in your collection as it is in mine.  ;)
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Where do I start?  I bought this originally solely for \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" and never really planned on watching any others, except \\"Hotel California\\".  Well, by some amazing chance, my Dad loved it, and after watching it, I love it!!  I'm normally a fan of harder music, like Metallica and Megadeth, but these songs just amaze me.  I love the two new songs, \\"One Day At A Time\\" & \\"No More Cloudy Days\\".  I found out that I already knew many of these songs, but just never knew they were done by the Eagles.  My personal favorites are \\"New Kid In Town\\", both new songs, \\"Hole In the World\\", You Belong to the City\\", \\"Walk Away\\", One of These Nights\\" and \\"The Boys of Summer\\".  There really isn't a song I don't like, and I can watch both discs all the way through.  I love the inclusion of the solo work from Henley, Frey, and Walsh.  The packaging is also fantastic, and it is evident that the Eagles care about putting out a quality product.  If you like the Eagles, or just a casual fan like I was, you will absolutely love this...plus it's the only place you can (legally) get \\"One Day At A Time\\" & \\"No More Cloudy Days\\".
B000B8QEZG|1.0|If you don't need lyrics that matter, if you're not listening for original melodies, if you like a beat that toddlers can dance to, this album is for you.  Thank goodness I sampled the songs on AOL first and saved myself much grief.  All I can say is, \\"Madonna, what a mess!\\"
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's new album Confessions on a Dance Floor is full of fun, danceable songs!  I love Hung Up, but the rest of the album outdoes that single!  Everything all clicks here! I could play these songs for days!  The second song Get Together is the best song on the album to me.  But the surprises are everywhere, including Jump, Push, Forbidden Love, How High, Sorry, Future Lovers and others. Isaac's tribal feel is good. Future Lovers will have you in a trance the entire time--you will be just zoned into the sound of it--no other 2005-released song has done that like this one. I Love New York justifies her love for the city where she got her start in dance clubs there. She might get flack from the cities she puts down in the song, but she defends NYC to the fullest! There are shades of Donna Summer, ABBA, some '70s disco, and one of her first hits \\"Holiday\\" within these songs, but the album manages to stay in the present time of 2005.  Madonna sounds much better vocally too.  The album has a nice continuity, as if you're in a New York nightclub when one songs weaves into the next one from the DJ, without the fades you hear on other albums.  She has some positive themes in songs like How High and stands up for herself in the last song of Like it or Not. This has the chance to have many hits in the future and have future No. 1 dance chart hits too. Right now, I'm going back to hearing this CD, because it is so catchy, so infectious!  Madonna is back to what made her a star in the first place with her dance sounds! This will be heavily played in clubs as well as playing in CD car stereos on long road trips on interstates!  It just has the fast grooves for the long open roads too!!!!!!!
B00097DXZS|1.0|You'll be surprised when you put this CD in your computer.  It does warn you that it's about to install software on your computer, an attempt at copyright protection.  When I declined to have it install this, the computer spit out the CD.   <br /> <br />A recent article describes how the anti-piracy software opens your computer to hackers.  Check it out here:  [...] <br /> <br />The music's fine if you can listen to it without installing the software, though it's not Supernatural.  I've been a fan of Santana's for years and appreciated his message of harmony, but this anti-piracy riff seems more like an STD than love.
0553801503|1.0|Well if Brienne of Tarth isn't the most uninteresting character of all time, then it certainly must be Cersei.  Why?  Because she turns out to be an overemotional idiot who is about as interesting as my butthole.  Why did she turn into a complete moron?  Has she been smoking to much marijuana?  Oh and the chapters on Brienne were absolutely the most unneccessary pieces, dare I call them pieces, of writing ever written in the history of fantasy.  How can you write over a hundred pages just to introduce a freaking zombie?  What happened to your moral scruples as a writer to keep the reader interested?  Why are you trying to extend the freaking series?  Why did you kill all semblance of pacing in the book?  Oh and why does nothing really happen?  Why wasn't this book made 500 pages shorter after editting.  Wow I didn't realize how much anger I felt at this book.  But the first three were so good, and this one just pales in comparison, and it just bites a fat one in general. FREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKING disappointing. FILLERS STINK.  NEED TO STOP THE FILLERS. <br /> <br />GOD THE STORY IS SO RIDICULOUS, why the freaking shizzle would you put in any of Brienne's chapters?!?!? Oh and the whole Jaime becoming this interesting dude... if he's only become a main character so his chapters can lead up to a zombie and die, please just kill him quicker and get it over with. <br /> <br />All of Briennes chapters. <br />\\"I must find a fair haired maiden yada yada yada\\" <br />\\"Oh you mean the stark girl?\\" <br />RPT 10x <br />Then oh it's a zombie! AHHH <br /> <br />All of Jaime's chapters. <br />\\"Argh Cersei is a slut albiet a sexy one.  My one handed ness is so irksome, I am going to train my left hand whee!\\" <br /> <br />All of Aryas chapters <br />(The only ones I found SOMEWHAT interesting) <br />Ooh I'm not Arya I'm cat oohlala, I'm learning so much oohlala <br />ok so it wasn't that interesting. <br /> <br />All of Sansa's chapters. <br />\\"I am Alayne, I must learn about the gameof thrones Littlefinger is my daddy, someone give me a dildo\\"  Ok so maybe she doesn't say that exactly but she sure as hell needs the dildo.  <br /> <br />All of Samwell's chapters. <br />\\"I'm a fat pathetic loser wah wah wah sob sob sob, Please maester Aemon don't die Gilly, you're so sexy but I'm a celibate.\\" =(  <br /> <br />Arianne's chapters <br />last one is vaguely interesting. <br /> <br />Is it just me or did all of the characters suddenly become a bunch of stupid excuses to write something on repeat? GARGH. <br /> <br />You probably won't understand how repetetive the book feels untill you've read it, you'll be in the second half of the book thinking didn't I JUST read this? wth?  <br /> <br />I wish I could give it zero stars, i would have given it maybe 2 stars just because I liked the rest of the serioes, but the average score is too high, so here's to hoping this brings that down. <br />
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Madonna back in the day always had a couple tracks where you could bop your head to,but once She found something that worked ie \\"Vouge\\" She stayed in the same groove&Vibe for a decade plus.her 1992 Album \\"Erotica\\" was slightly better than Average on a whole,but it was the first time In her  Career Where she came across desperate for something to click.fast forward to now&she has continued to make tired Hack Albums&this one is Average at best.better than the last one which ain't saying much,but Madonna seems out of ideas&Freshness.vocally she is flat.Musically doing the same ole same that she has been doing for quite a while now.not a memorable Track on here at all.I use to dig Her stuff back in the day,but that seems so long ago.I give her dap for finding ways to hang on&keep Herself still as Mattering into this Era,but there comes a time when your Records start to stink&you might want to take up something else.Madonna is Played&unless she finds another Groove then it ain't even worth peeping out.alot of the modern Madonna just leaves me cold.
B000BGR0OM|3.0|I've always been a fan of Annie Lennox's voice, so as I got older I not only enjoyed her solo work, but the work she'd done with Dave Stewart (excellent producer!).  Seeing as how there has been a resurgence in 1980's music, the Eurythmics finally got onto the train, reissuing all eight of their studio albums from 1981 through 1999.  Along with that, they reissued their hits package.<br /><br />Originally there were two hits compilations: the U.S. version of 1991's \\"Greatest Hits\\" focusing exclusively on their U.S. singles & the U.K. version of that same set, which included the notable well-known hits, as well as the U.K. hits they racked up when their popularity declined in the late 1980's in the States.<br /><br />The new reissue succeeds on it's merit of offering a much more meatier (in theory) hits package. It is the first domestic States release to feature all of their well-known singles, as well as singles that were well known in the U.K..  Add in two brilliant new tracks (\\"I've Got A Life\\" & \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair\\") along with both singles from their last full-length album \\"Peace\\"; you've  got the complete singles collection for the Eurythmics. Right? Wrong.<br /><br />Like Kylie, the Eurythmics titled their hits set \\"ultimate\\", & it slights several singles. While their very first record \\"In the Garden\\" once again is unrepresented, \\"Sexcrime (Nineteen-Eighty-Four)\\" from the \\"1984\\" Motion Picture Soundtrack, \\"Beethoven (I Love To Listen To)\\" from \\"Savage\\" (which as an album had no hit U.S. singles really), & the singles \\"Angel\\", \\"King & Queen of America\\", & \\"Don't Aask Me Why\\" from \\"We Too Are One\\" are left off.<br /><br />I can't complain too much though, because I do have the original hits set, I just wish that when artists do hits sets that they live up to the title of that set.  With that said, this is clearly the best buy, unless you own all of their albums. Also, the booklet features the lyrics with excellent full-color & black & white photos of Dave & Annie!
B000063DIH|4.0|It's interesting, most people seem to think that Iron Maiden went into an artistic decline in the 90's, but no one seems to talk to much about why, other than that they don't like Blaze.  Still, before Blaze showed up this band had become pretty different from the classic Iron Maiden, even if they still were the same basic subgenre.  Here they started to move in the semi-epic, pseudo-prog metal direction that has defined their style ever since.  It's certainly not as far as they would go in later albums, but that's definitely the direction they're heading.  This album also has a bit more of a hard rock flavor to it, which is pretty weird.  Overall it's pretty good, but with probably only 1 legitimately great song, and too many tracks.  (If a metal album has over 10 tracks it almost certainly has too many.)<br /><br />'Fear of the Dark' is the legitimately great track, and it is indeed awesome.  A nice memorable, galloping epic well worthy of being named with all their other great epics.  'Be Quick Or Be Dead' is a solid speed metal number.  Not their best thing, but solid.  'From Here to Eternity', 'Chains of Misery' and 'Weekend Warrior' are all lighter, hard rock-ish rockers.  None of them is bad, particularly 'Weekend Warrior', which is very catchy, but they're all a bit cheesy and certainly not up to IM's standards.  The album has a weird stretch of semi-epics and ballads stretching from tracks 3 thru 6. (This is the part of the album which particularly displays their evolution)  'Afraid to Shoot Strangers' and 'Childhood's End' are the best of them, and are very good, if generally pretty low-key.  'Wasting Love' is the purest ballad, and it's pretty decent, if not remarkable.  An effective chorus.  'Fear is the Key' is the darkest one, rather reminiscent of what you'd hear on 'The X Factor'.  Not great, but sufficiently interesting, and different.  'The Fugitive' is one of your more classic Maiden songs, stylistically, except that it is really quite grating, with a very irritating chorus.  'The Apparition' is a little bland, not too aggravating but not of much particular interest.  'Judas Be My Guide' is a highpoint, the strongest track other than the title track.  A very nice epic chorus.<br /><br />Overall very little of what you'll hear on this album is bad, but it is almost uniformly a cut below classic Maiden.(And you pretty much never heard anything bad on the first 7 Maiden albums)  Still, it's worth owning.with a very irritating chorus.

B000005TRO|4.0|This is a great album! With Lauras most popular Italian songs translated into spanish versions! As usual she has an extremely beautiful and powerful voice and is a joy to listen to in whichever language she sings in! She does sing a lot better in italian though, but that is because that it is her mother tounge, this is still and AMAZING album and she sings beautifully on it!
0812548094|4.0|After reading the first book it wasn't long before I had to drive to the store to get the next one. It didn't let me down. This book is a bit on the long side, but that really is not a bad thing. I found myself at the end not wanting to pages to run out! I would highly recoomend this book. The reason I gave this book 4 stas instead of 5 is just because, for me, his writing on a 5 star level, I reserve 5 stars for the absolute best books in my option. This book won't be a waste of your time!
6304493681|5.0|When this film was released in theatres in the US, it was denounced by some critics for being \\"too philosophical.\\" It's amazing how often that term comes up around great works of art. Socrates, Jesus, Ayn Rand... so many people denounced for being \\"too philosophical.\\" Honestly.<br /><br />Anyways, I am relatively unfamiliar with most Japanese animation, but I am a great fan of cyberpunk films and this one fits the ticket well. In the future, when the information age has grown to the level of cities and structural definitions of separation between machine and human are breaking down, a feminine cyborg is hunting down a mysterious hacker called the Puppet Master who's history and purpose remains completely unknown.<br /><br />The animation here is really beautiful and contains magnificent imagery. One of the great things about going with animation as opposed to filming sets and the like is that every shadow, light, and body is completely controllable, even if it's just added in as an afterthought. Nothing in this film seems just \\"added in,\\" though, as everything from the city to the nudity is of symbolic import.<br /><br />It's also clear that this film is yet another of the many various works that culminated inspired the Wachowski brothers. A lot of the imagery of this film is very much reminiscent of The Matrix (or, to put it more accurately, The Matrix is very reminiscent of this film).<br /><br />It's not actually much on the action side of things (though it has it's moments), but it certainly is worth the watch, especially to see mostly the imagery and how the characters live and interact with it.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am very pleased with this album, and considering I have only physically bought 3 albums in the past year, I highly recommend this is one to get if you are a fan of dance music and definitely if you are a fan of Madonna.  I'm not sure what these previous reviewers who gave 1 star were expecting.  She's not going back to her \\"Holiday\\" days and she never said she was, why would she?  She's constantly changing with the times and music.  Sampling is only done on a few songs, and I don't hear people complaining about it when every other artist does it (people have even sampled Madonna's old songs, so it's about time she gets to do it!)  And if the sampling works, then why NOT?!  \\"Hung Up\\" is the best dance song of the year.  Other standout tracks include \\"Sorry\\", \\"Jump\\", and \\"Push\\".  I think I liked every song on this CD (which is a feat for me, because I'm very particular).  Madonna's last album (American Life) really dissapointed me, but this one just delivers the goods over and over again.  AND, she is 47, give the woman a friggin' break!  She looks damn good, and she doesn't even look plastic like some other older pop stars these days (that is NOT a poke at Cher, by the way, cause I love her too). She's always on top of her game, and who else in the business is cranking out top 10 albums and singles for 20 consecutive years?  Give Madonna some much deserved credit, people!  I don't care who reviews this album, it does NOT deserve 1 star.  But like Madonna says on \\"I love New York\\":  \\"If you don't like my attitude, then you can F off!\\"  I couldn't have said it better myself.  Maybe those who don't like this album can go to the mall and buy Ashlee Simpson's latest dribble or maybe go re-purchase Britney's last album.  If you want real music, buy this.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Some of the stuff is good but after a while it gets really annoying. My bro bought the cd and its driving me crazy! Like I said before some of it is good but its really something you listen to a couple times before its old. Its even worse though because they wouldnt quit playing everything on the cd on the radio.
B0007OCG56|5.0|Spanglish is a movie that is not for a one time view only.  The layers of messages are far too many for one sitting.  It's during the second or third time through, do you, the viewer, begin to see how painful it is to be Deb Clasky.  She seems to have it all, yet she has nothing.  Her wildness and seemingly ego-centric actions only point out how desparate she is to get out of her situation.  She sees no value in being a wife and mother.  John Clasky, played brilliantly by Adam Sandler, is a man lost in his own story of success and failure.  Flor and Cristina only walk into this mess of a family, by accident.  It is Flor's balance and strong sense of self that begins to have an effect on the loose cannons residing in the Clasky household, save Deb.  Bernie, the daughter, finds a true heart in Flor - like her own.  The grandmother finds an interest in helping out her grandkids, which in turn, helps her to stop boozing.  John finds the very thing that's been missing in his relationship with Deb.  He finds a woman who knows and loves a sensitive soul when she sees one.  Flor truly is John's soul to soul connection.  Deb, well, she needs to go be important again.  If I had to write a sequel, then John and Flor would be together with grandma and kids living as a warm, happy, and intelligent family.  Deb would be driving herself nuts running her own design firm, with the help of prozac and counseling. Take another look at this film before you decide that it falls short.  It has many, many lessons wrapped in the most unconventional package.
B000AA305M|5.0|Obviously, we weren't the only ones who were enchanted by the majestic sound of Rufus Wainwright's most recent works, `Want One' and `Want Two'.  David Gray must have also been enamored because he has employed those albums' producer, Marius de Vries, on `Life in Slow Motion'.   And the results are just as auspicious.  Gray's most fully realized album, to this point, was `White Ladder', distinguished by an innovative combination of singer/songwriter craft with spare but modern studio techniques. To an extent, Gray leaves that realm behind, herein resorting to a much grander, orchestral approach, courtesy, one surmises, of Monsieur de Vries' input.  Gray's thoughtful, introspective songs--earnest, for the most part with flickers of humor-benefit by the production and are more lush, more dramatic, more beautiful.  Occasionally the production tends to become a bit heavy-handed and flirts dangerously with pretentiousness (as does that sentence).  In fact, some of the most arresting moments on the cd are those with the sparest arrangements, those that simply serve to brace Gray's marvelous vocals.  We can think of only a handful of singers around these days who move us to the depths that Gray does.  Should he continue to gift us with songs as nicely rendered as these, he may well end up among our eternal favorites, along side the artist he most reminds us, Van Morrison.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I just bought the new soundtrack for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It has been a tradition for me to go out the day each one comes out and get it. I was sad to find out that John Williams is no longer the \\"music man\\" for the Harry Potter productions, but as I found out I am beginning to like Patrick Doyle's take on how the music should sound. I like the Celtic/Scottish feel of some of the tracks. However, my favorite track is the Hogwarts march because of the brass ensemble which performs it. I am always in awe of a brass ensemble that can sound that good. You may not like the change, because the original harry potter feel is gone. However, with change in the story line comes change in the music...
B000B8QF14|5.0|Yeah sure, so the setlist sucks. We all wanted \\"We are the Champions\\". Most of us wanted \\"Whatsername\\". I especially wanted \\"Letterbomb\\". But there again if I was picking the setlist, we'd have \\"Panic Song\\", \\"Densensitized\\", \\"C#(tion)\\", \\"Bab's Uvala Who?\\", \\"Road to Acceptance\\", \\"Android\\" and a bunch of other songs the majority of Green Day fans have probably never even heard of. Then there are other more, shall we say, obnoxious things. Pyrotechnics went out with spandex, didn't they? The choreography and Mike Dirnt's exaggerated moves sometimes look like they'd be better placed in a Bollywood musical. And then, of course, there's the mood-shattering inter-song featurettes and the dizzying array of ever-changing camera angles. I'm sure I'll have more gripes later too. In totality, though, \\"Bullet in a Bible\\" (bless that title, hands down one of rock's best ever) is an unmitigated triumph for Green Day fans everywhere. Just a couple of years earlier, this is a band even those of us diehards were telling ourselves to forget about. A lukewarm album, a meandering trajectory, nothing we could really get our hopes up about. Yet Green Day, that archetypal little band that could, rose to become the undisputed biggest band in the world. As I write this, they indeed are the champions. Bigger than U2. And \\"Bullet in a Bible\\" captures that very sweet moment when Billie Joe, Mike, and Tr are at the very cusp of realizing just what a monster they've given birth to, how important they all now are. It's clearly an ecstatic moment for them, and for those of us too who have followed this band throughout its journey over the undulating, unpredictable seascape of stardom. What is especially sweet about it is Green Day conquered the world only by embracing all that had built them up. \\"American Idiot\\" is, at its core, a quintessential punk album anchored in themes familiar enough to everyone who know enough about what punk is to not ever dare to define it. Those themes, borne out well in staples of the genre like Screeching Weasel's \\"Anthem for a New Tommorow\\", NOFX' \\"The Decline\\", and the gorgeous writings of Aaron Cometbus (see \\"The Cometbus Omnibus\\"), are illuminated brilliantly, put to amazing music reflecting the very best of punk rock, and woven together with a commitment to coherency that comes only with the true care you almost never see anymore. \\"American Idiot\\" was punk taking over the mainstream and transforming it, and not - as not has so rampantly been the case over recent years - the mainstream taking over punk and destroying it. That's a brilliant, beautiful thing. For there are kids everywhere who need punk. Not the music per se, but the self-reliance and the empowerment that it provides. With \\"American Idiot\\", Green Day brought not hope, but satisfaction with reality to millions of kids across the mindless sprawl of suburbia. \\"Bullet in a Bible\\" celebrates that in all of the glory it deserves. So the setlist is tepid, the choreography painfully contrived, and everything from the band uniforms to the fireworks is strikingly anachronistic. This ain't U2's \\"Zoo TV\\" either - for innovation in your entertainment, look elsewhere. For the revolution is not on the jumbotron, it's in the hearts and minds of the 130,000 people seeing this show and, particularly, in the 3 band members on stage. For me at least, that's a joy to watch.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|Not one, apparently, to cash in on her success, Madeleine Peyroux waited 8 years between the release of her very well-received debut, `Dreamland' and this one.  Clearly, she didn't use the time to make any stylistic changes.  `Careless Love' is cut from much the same cloth as `Dreamland' and that's just fine and dandy with us.  Peyroux might be best described as a jazz singer, but, much like her slightly older contemporary, Cassandra Wilson, Peyroux just finds good songs by good writers and does them her way-in this case with the skillful assistance of producer Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell, Shawn Colvin) and some terrific players.  The songs on `Careless Love' include those written by Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen (with a touch of Leonard Bernstein), Hank Williams and W.C. Handy.  The album draws you in with the \\"Cool\\" riff that begins the first and best track, Cohen's `Dance Me to the End of Love' (re: \\"Cool\\" riff: The song \\"Cool\\", from our favorite musical of all time, `West Side Story' is sung by the character \\"Ice\\" and \\"The Jets\\" after the fatal stabbing of, ironically, \\"Riff\\"). Following that, there is some jazz, some blues, some gospel, some folk, some country, some French chanson.  Most of all, some singer.  Peyroux is some singer.  There is not a review that we have ever read about her that doesn't compare her voice to Billie Holiday's and ours won't be the first.  Her smoky vocals and languid phrasing are utterly beguiling.  It is hard to believe that, even now, she is only about 30 years old.  If Ms. Peyroux wants to continue to put out just one album per decade, so be it.  As long as each is as good as these first two, the wait will be worth it.
0399241515|5.0|Anthony Horowitz has definitely created a masterpiece here. This book is simply the best. If you're into action, read this. Alex Rider, a reluctant MI6 teenage spy, is now chasing his parents' history. Alex Rider has many surprises with Scorpio, the organisation mentioned to him by Yassen just before his death. An action packed book which even has one final twist in the last few pages. I just couldn't put it down. BRILLIANT!!!!!!!
B0006B2A2E|5.0|This movie is nothing short of amazing.  I've watched it about 4 times now to completely understand all that's going on throughout it and each time I get more emotional and tear up almost to the point of sobbing.  (I'm sure that will come with number 5).  This is not to say that you'll be completely out to lunch the first time you watch it.  You'll feel a little lost, but by the end you'll know what's happened.     One thing that's easy to do is get wrapped up in the whole computers erasing memories aspect.  Don't get fooled by this red herring for too long.  This movie is just a very dramatic, surreal portrayal of what we do with any failed relationship.  We   reminisce and obsess about the bad times, then do the same with the good times.  All the while doing our best to shove the memories deep into our subconscious so we can move on only to wake up and do it all over again.  But hopefully with some new found wisdom that will make the dream never ending the next time.    This is one of THE central themes to life and this movie lays it in your lap in the most original way.  Charlie Kaufmann is an absolute genius!!!
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Sufjan (pronounced Suf-yan) Stevens may be the most ambitious artist in pop music today.  He has, reportedly, announced plans to record an album for each state in the Union.  This is Number 2 (`Michigan' preceded it).  We haven't heard `Michigan' but, if it is anywhere near as complex and intricate a work as `Illinois', Stevens may not be emerging from his studio again this century. (Actually, we admit that we know that he has emerged and is one of the hottest tickets on tour).  `Illinois', the album, is nothing if not ambitious.  Steven's lyrics address issues historical, biographical, psychological, educational and/or personal in nature.  Some could pertain only to Illinois, some just happen to be set there. Many lyrics must have involved extensive research.  And we've seen Masters theses substantially shorter than the composite titles of the songs on `Illinois'.  (In his whimsical style, Stevens reserves his longest titles-one of which is more than 40 words-for his shortest tracks, the filler, if you will.)  Steven's lyrics are generally compelling, witty and devoid of clich.  Ironically, we once rhetorically asked the question in a review of a Randy Newman cd elsewhere on this site, \\"Is there another popular songwriter capable of crawling into the skin of a child murderer with such chilling empathy?\\"  It just so happens that there is an answer and it is, \\"Yes. Stevens does on the incisive `John Wayne Gacy, Jr.'\\" The music on `Illinois' is equally impressive and complex, composed of orchestral arrangements, vocal choirs, and elements of styles from classical to folk.  Alluding to the most recent works that we've recommended on this site, we'd describe this as a cross between Brian Wilson's `Smile' and The Polyphonic Spree.  Not everything here is as pleasurable as it is formidable.  As is evident, editing is not one of Steven's strengths and some of this material is grandiose, pretentious and, at times, exasperatingly boring.  Nonetheless, the uniqueness of thiscd is well worth your curiosity.  We are looking forward to hearing (not to mention surviving long enough to hear) the forthcoming tributes to the other 48 states.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Don't be fooled by reviews saying this album is a true dance record and that it is the best album Madonna has ever made, it's not the truth! Sadly Madonna just can't seem to leave the electronica style of music behind and it's become exhausting and predictable. While Confessions is a step towards dance it never really gets into the genre completly. The beats are however infectious (hence the 3 star rating) but lyrically and vocally the album falls flat. One of Madonna's greatest gifts is that she always has been able to write some of the most catchy pop tunes of our time (Holiday, Like a Prayer, Lucky Star etc..) but here the songs are totally forgettable. I've listened to the album at least 4 times and other than Hung Up I can't remember any other song. They don't \\"stick\\". This album will soon find itself out of my cd player and will be laid to rest with the other cds I shouldn't have bought collecting dust.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I am truly disgusted.  Are some consumers being punished for running out and getting this cd when it was first released?  Here we are, two singles later, with an 'expanded' version of this project.  I know what the marketing team thought: \\"We'll get the people who already have it to buy it again, to get the additional tracks...and we'll finally hook the ones who have thinking about buying it, but haven't yet...\\".  I can't speak for everyone, but I'm sick of this 'double-dipping' that's become so common in the industry.  I and won't be suckered into it...I'll just get a copy - yes, a COPY, from a friend.  Ugh.

CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR did that to me. this album has brilliance all over it.  the lyrics maynot be the best but madonnas team of producers help to make CONFESSIONS a well rounded LP... <br /> <br />the first single 'hung up' is amazing and very different than all the pops songs out right now.  the ABBA sample is just timeless.  i can listen to this song all friggin night in any dance club.   <br /> <br />\\"sorry\\" is another banger on this album.  i love the guiter riffs and the synthisizers going off. her voice is sooo haunting on this particular track. should be one of her singles off this album. <br /> <br />my favourite tracks: <br />'like it or not' take that you haters <br />'forbidden love' <br />'isaac' <br />'i love new york' <br />'get together' <br /> <br />this whole album is a great party LP. she really went eurodance with is LP. its just amazing how she can reinvent herself and become a hit all over again. her last effort AMERICAN LIFE has nothing on this LP.   <br /> <br />5 out of 5 stars <br />
B000B0QOJA|5.0|Less a review perhaps and more of a reminisence, _John Coltrane: One Up, One Down; Live at the Half Note_ (Impulse--B0002380-02--released in 2005) drew me back to days gone by in New York the Spring of 1965.  My brother Mike and I were in the City for about a week in April-May, on a mission to pick up a Volkswagen shipped from France to the Brooklyn Army Terminal by our dad who had been reassigned a new job with the US Army.  We rode the 'George Washington' train from Lexington, Kentucky to New York's Penn Station via Washington, DC. and would drive the VW back to our new home in the Bluegrass.  While in New York we took every advantage of the opportunity to listen to jazz in the clubs.  One night we walked way over to the west side from our friend's digs on E. 6th St at 2nd Ave. to listen to the John Coltrane Quartet at the Half Note Cafe, corner of Spring and Hudson. From start to finish, Mike and I were mesmerized by the music.  (I had first heard Coltrane with the Miles Davis quintet at the Olympia Theater in Paris in 1960.  And again leading his quartet at the Olympia in 1962 where, cigar in hand, he and McCoy and Jimmy (though not on the recording) autographed my copy of his _My Favorite Things_.)  The evening at the Half Note was just another gig for the Quartet evidently. No recording session was happening and the audience was sparse even in this modestly-sized club.  The intensity of the music did bring a few to their feet and I remember one or two guys standing on their chairs.  Later in the evening (probably 1 or 2 in the morning actually) following a break, I remember seeing a young trumpeter up on the bandstand trying to get a sound out of his instrument while Jones, Tyner, and Garrison drove the pulse. My feeling at the time was that Elvin was not pleased at what must have been an impromptu appearance of this struggling apprentice trumpet player. And within moments, Coltrane the master re-appeared and took charge. I've always wondered if anyone else present that night experienced the sense of mastery exuded by these musicians and the frustration of an apprentice.  Intensity is the only word that comes to mind. When the gig was over, lights up, and 'Trane was sitting on the bottom step of the bandstand which was chest level above the floor, talking to Elvin, my brother and I just stood there just waiting not wanting to leave.  I have imagined Coltrane's conversation with his Mephistophelian drummer to have included something like the following remarks:  Elvin asking, \\"John, why do you let these inexperienced musicians sit in?\\" and Coltrane answering softly, \\"Elvin, where else but on the bandstand can an apprentice learn to play?\\"  Mike and I left the Half Note and stood on the sidewalk wet with rain. Across the street was a glaring TEXACO sign.  Coltrane was right behind us, instrument cases in each hand, and Mike and I watched him walk up Hudson Street into the dark until he disappeared from sight.  I am pleased to have this recording now as a reminder of me how precious is the experience of hearing these musicians `live' - masters and apprentice.
1400032717|5.0|Other reviewers have covered the basics of this book:  that it is a murder mystery told from the point of view of the autistic boy trying to discover who killed his neighbor's dog.  In the process, we get to know and like this boy, learn how he processes the world around him, discover the joys and heartbreaks he experiences, and root for him as he overcomes his most paralyzing fears.  The inner dialogue of the main character really rang true for me, and his story was tender and funny and tragic and uplifting -- all the things you want in a really good read.  Sure, this book helps people understand autism.  But it's also just a really superb story, superbly written.  Can't recommend it highly enough.
0064410935|5.0|This is one of the book that all children should read. It is easy to read and is a very enjoyable story.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I don't care what anyone says: Madonna's last album tanked because it sucked, period. Had nothing to do with downloading and for the record, take a look at how many \\"used\\" versions are for sale of American Life. Quite a few. Same thing happened with \\"Bedtime Stories\\" which was just way too \\"out there\\" for her usual fans. Downloading didn't exist back then. Same with Erotica. With all three examples, she tried something new that didn't work and rethought her marketing-music strategy: What worked? Dance music and that's what she's known for and thank God she returned to it.<br /><br />The one consistency of Madge's music lately would be all the \\"We can save the world\\" themes that have been very prominent and repetitious throughout her last couple albums. On \\"Ray of Light\\" it was amazing to hear: A very fresh, honest and heartwarming confession from a seemingly money-grubbing diva who was humbled at the sight of a spirituality that actually touched her; She was awed and meant it. However, this \\"I don't deserve anything I've got\\" attitude has made her a lot of money because she keeps doing this in her albums since then. Madge, it's getting old and we can't pity you anymore.<br /><br />This time, she's wised up and for the most part put down the preachy acoustic guitar and vocoder (what a weird combo) and dusted off the old synthesizer that made her a superstar in the 80s. Smart move, Madge. When in doubt, go back to your roots. After all, that is what made her a star. (Now if she'd go back to her ROOTS of being a brunette... never mind, I digress.) She took a page out of Abba's book, seems like she threw a little William Orbit back in there and said that she wanted to go back out on the dance floor. But confessions? What, she has NEW confessions? Aside from the ones we heard on the last three albums?<br /><br />Not really. Most of them we've all heard before and it does get a bit old. She doesn't bombard us with \\"downer\\" lyrics like she did in American Life, or \\"stupid\\" lyrics (i.e., \\"I am so stupid\\" -- probably the most annoying song in the world.) The first half of the album kind of focuses on being a scorned lover, the second half gets \\"deep\\" with Kabala messages. But they're general enough morals that for the most part we can apply them to life without thinking she's like Tom Cruise channeling one of his alien gods at us.<br /><br />So here's my take on her album, music-wise and lyrical translation wise for you fanatics out there:<br /><br />Starts out very Abba, ends very trance-like and groovy. Coolest part would be all the songs mix into each other in order to create one large song. The entire album plays like one big song and you have to hear it as one whole piece to really get into it. Essentially, this is how you should listen to it.<br /><br />Hung Up: We've heard this a good handful of times, now. Personally I think this is the *weakest* song of all of them, mostly because it's an Abba sampling that is the core of the song. Still, it is catchy but limited, in my opinion.<br /><br />Get Together: Total throwback to Maddie's very first album. It completely reminds me of \\"Everybody\\" only more refined and not so raw as the original. She's eased up on the vocoder, thank God. Lyrics include: \\"Can we get together/I hope you feel the same way, too.\\" But, she's gotta throw in the phrases at the end in either French or Spanish in order to make the song seem very deep. When it's pop - you really can't do that. Pop is never serious and that's what makes it pop.<br /><br />Sorry: Ah, another \\"humbled\\" song. This time, however, it's Madge dissing a former lover. Seems really strange that this is coming from her considering she's happily married. Usually, she pulls from her current experiences so either married life is kinda bad lately or she's still pulling from Cher's \\"Believe\\" era that swept the world (I got the impression that the fact Cher's single really WAS world-wide famous, it really cheezed Madge's ego. God knows she hung onto that stupid vocoder for ages.) The song is definitely dance and slightly catchy. Her lyric-writing is getting better despite the fact it's still pop. It's got a few minor keys in it and a nice bass beat.<br /><br />Future Lovers: \\"I'm going to tell you about love/Would you like to try?\\" it starts out. This tune has an interestingly catchy techno-eastern feeling to it. She also hit some serious high notes in harmony that sounds nice. \\"There's no love/like future love.\\" Why is there a concentration on future lovers? Hmmmm... Fun tune that is going to be overlooked like Impressive Instant was on Music.<br /><br />I Love New York: \\"I don't like cities/but I like New York/Other places/Make me feel like a dork.\\" Jeeze, this is as cringeworthy as her rapping on her last album -- just embarrassing lyrics. She obviously wrote the lyrics for this one because they're pretty bad. You can always tell when Madge writes her own lyrics cause they're incredibly sophomoric. \\"Just go to Texas/Isn't that where they golf?\\" An obvious attempt at looking at sections of the country (she disses the ones she doesn't like and praises New York) and trying to be deep about it. Comes across very shallow and stereotypical, unfortunately. Weird techno song that I just can't see picking up, even in New York. Ends with sounds of New York in the background.<br /><br />Let it Will Be: *Insert preachy song here* \\"I'm gonna tell you about being a star.\\" We have Madge saying not to worry about being a star and just \\"let it be.\\" Well, that's all great and fine but if it's so bad, why are you, Madonna, doing it yourself? Other than that, the music is great, the dance is fun. Lots of minor key, and again a nice bass thumping in the background. Strings in the background as well which sound great. This has a theater-Abba-esque feel to it - well, hey wasn't that what she was going for?<br /><br />Forbidden Love; \\"How are we supposed to be together?\\" Darn it! Just when I thought she got rid of the vocoder for good, she slips it back in! Thank God it's in the background and doesn't dominate the main vocals. This is another \\"strange\\" song that talks about a lover who is forbidden. Life imitating art? Dunno. Unfortunately, although it has a \\"Love Profusion\\" feel to it, it definitely is a throw away tune. Slower, still heavy beat but repetitious lyrics and just plain \\"okay.\\"<br /><br />Jump: \\"Get ready to jump/don't ever look back/I'm ready to jump/Just take my hand\\" Really interesting song for Madge and interestingly enough it almost seems as if she's finally realized her mortality. \\"There's only so much that you can learn in one place/The more time that you wait, the more time that you waste.\\" Her lyrics are a little bit deeper and it stands out. Not too bad on the lyrics, here. Very nice pop tune with a flowy gossamer feel to it for the dance floor.<br /><br />How High: Beginning feels like a throw back to Mirwais, (man, I hate that guy) unfortunately - and there's that obnoxious vocoder again. And AGAIN, she talks about how \\"nobody's perfect\\" and that she \\"doesn't deserve her fortune\\" or \\"how much fortune can a person make?\\"... blah, blah, blah... Madge seems obsessed with the fact that she doesn't deserve the success that she's received and overuses lyrics from albums before. It's a very tired, nothing song. One thing that Madonna seems to forget is that she used to write lyrics that EVERYONE could relate to - writing about being a multi-millionaire and hating it is not making a hit out of her work, no matter how catchy the tune and even this tune isn't that catchy. Still she ends with: \\"Will it matter when I'm gone?\\" Interesting - maybe Madonna thinks she's not as interesting as she markets herself to be.<br /><br />Issac: Okay, this is the Kabala song that the rabbis have been ticked about. Starts out with some Hebrew, that's obvious. The singer is male and is repeating a variety of phrases we just... don't know what they mean, so unless you know Hebrew you're outof luck. This tune has a little \\"Fiddler\\" feel to it. Reminds me a bit of Shanti/Ashtangi -- only Jewish. Not bad, throw away tune for sure but definitely \\"artsy.\\" Madge tends to throw in art tunes, like Shanti/Ashtangi, or like Act of Contrition. Unfortunately, it seems to go over your head as to its real meaning. \\"Wrestle with your darkness/angels call your name.\\" Why? Can this relate to anyone or is it strictly for those studying Kabala?<br /><br />Push: \\"You push me/when I stumble, when I fall\\" Really interesting tongue-in-cheek song. She's thanking someone for \\"pushing her\\" even when she doesn't want to be but you get the feeling she does resent it... maybe just a bit. \\"Every mood I'm in/I owe it all to you.\\" The music is much slower, again, heavy beat but only die-hard Madonna fans would really dig this tune. It is possible that this is also about Guy? Music-wise, complete throw away song.<br /><br />Like it or Not: Ending with formal string instruments and a rising orchestra. Throw back beginning to \\"Mer Girl\\" \\"Sticks and stones may break your bones/but I'll never break.\\" She turns around and says: \\"Like me or not, this is who I am,\\" Alright so we have a bit of differences here: She regrets her decisions of the past but turns around at the end and says: \\"Well, deal with me.\\" In my opinion, Madge is still struggling with her spiritual identity. We've got references to the devil in this one as well. I have a feeling this will be another \\"anthem\\" of hers because she seems to identify with it so much. For instance, she always makes a point of playing \\"Human Nature.\\" We have the same song again, but not quite so catchy.<br /><br />How do I feel about the whole thing? It's got its good points, it's got some fun beats but nothing really infectuous like some of her other music from ages ago. The one thing I really miss was Maddie's pushing her art over her marketing. I \\"confess\\" that I miss when Madonna made an effort to hide the fact that her priority was always profit. Now, because she markets the hell out of her products (Hello Moto!) I really don't feel that she cares about her fans as much as her bank account and in the end, part of me stopped caring about her, too.<br /><br />All in all, we have a HUGE step up from \\"American Life, a much smaller step up from \\"Music\\", but still two steps behind \\"Ray of Light\\" which I still loved most because I think it was a work of art, like \\"Like a Prayer\\" was. In the end, I'll probably download the few songs I like off iTunes rather than buy the whole album. Regular fans: Not bad, if you like the techno/disco feel, go for it, especially at the lower price. Madonna fanatics: Well, you guys always love what she puts out so why bother saying you'll love it?  Tell you what -- if there are Madonna fanatics that agree with me out there -- say \\"No\\" this review did not help... just to be different. :)vocals.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I like \\"Hung Up\\", but it doesn't blow me away. The rest of the album does. If you heard \\"Hung Up\\" on the radio and didn't like it, don't let it steer you away from this record! Madonna is back, with a CD you can put in and not have to skip tracks on.
B00005J6T1|5.0|I used to own this album on vinyl, and it remains one of Madonna's standout albums.  This is how we were all introduced to her. I recently picked up the digitally remasterd CD, and listening to it reminded me what a classic it is.  From the opening track \\"Lucky Star\\", it was great to hear these classics again ... and more importantly in their original form.  Buying this album is the only way to get \\"Holiday\\", \\"Borderline\\" and \\"lucky Star\\" as we all first heard them. The compilation \\"Immaculate Collection\\" swapped them for remixes.  Also included on this album is \\"Burning Up\\" which was an early hit for Madonna but ommitted from the Immaculate Collection.  Other standout gems on the album include \\"Think of Me\\" and \\"everybody\\". <br /> <br />Overall, a must own Madonna album.
B00005JO1G|3.0|The first Gulf War in Iraq has been an occasional subject matter of films, but not until Jarhead has a bona fide story emerged which captures the experience and heartache as told by director Sam Mendes.  Although Mendes has never been able to match the heights of American Beauty, he does an effective job of making the audience a participant in the rigors of desert warfare.   <br /> <br />Raw recruits are thrust into rough, basic training (at times with tragic results) as they are prepared for duty in Iraq. Among them are Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Troy (Peter Sarsgaard).  Drill Sgt. Siek (Jamie Foxx) whips the young men into soldiers as they are deployed in the Persian Gulf with the imminent threat of war.  This is a rough life with constant humiliation and hazing.  Then comes Operation Desert Shield with the endless training, waiting, monotony, and more time away from family and home where wives and girlfriends lose touch or stray.  Such is the hapless life of the grunt.  A hostile terrain such as dirty oil fields adds to the isolation and need for rebellious acts to mitigate frustration.  Swofford and Troy are groomed to be snipers, and when their opportunity comes in Operation Desert Storm, they are more than ready until they are dealt an unexpected turn of events.   <br /> <br />The recurring phrase or motif in the film is \\"Welcome to the suck.\\" That about sums up what these men are put through.  Adapted by William Broyles Jr. from Swofford's own real life experiences, it is an uncompromising recreation of `the suck'.  Mendes is content to show you what it was like but never dwells on any one scene longer than needed to get his point across. <br /> <br />Told essentially from his point of view, the film opens and closes with a telling monologue by Swofford that sums up his experience.  He and Troy form the nucleus of the film's conscience and soul. Swofford made the mistake of signing up while Troy is the ironic soldier who wants to fight a war but is thwarted by bureaucracy.  The film does ring true in its depiction of the preparation for warfare with the heavy toll it takes on the soldiers and their personal lives. Periodically, an onscreen tag will appear to list the number of days the surging numbers of troops were in Iraq (5000 troops increases to 575,000 troops in 175 days), which helps put the events in perspective.  This film demythologizes war and instead presents war as a difficult and often life changing experience resulting not from actual combat, but from the tedium and loneliness.   <br /> <br />It is important to note that although Swofford shows a dislike for this man's army, he continues to do as he is told.  This apolitical film does not really take a stance on the war.   We really don't get enough background on Swofford or Troy to understand what makes these men tick.  Rather, we are left with what they experience and how they respond on a superficial level.  Troy comes across as inconsistent and his motivations are questionable.  While the evolution of their relationship doesn't always make sense, the film still packs an emotional punch. About two-thirds through, the film's momentum begins to lose some steam and direction.  There is also a sad event toward the end that is never fully explained.   <br /> <br />Gyllenhaal (Proof, Donnie Darko) is showing good maturity as an actor, and Sarsgaard (Kinsey) is effective as his closest buddy.  Jamie Foxx (Ray) registers quite convincingly as the leader of this bunch.  Dennis Haysbert and Chris Cooper have short but effective moments as commanding officers with axes to grind. <br /> <br />Although movies have been set in the Iraqi conflict like Three Kings, this film deals directly with the soldiers who must do the dirty work.  In some ways this film shares a pedigree with an ensemble piece like Battleground. There are allusions to the Vietnam War particularly at the end involving a Vietnam veteran and also in clips from Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter. The early drills recall some of the most harrowing moments from Full Metal Jacket with the verbal insults and discipline.  In fact, some of the vicious lines are hysterically funny.  It's certainly a far cry from An Officer and Gentlemen.  Like the soldiers at the beginning of Born on the Fourth of July, they go in wide eyed, full of optimism, and ready for action.  Instead, what they find is something that beats their spirits down.  In a way, the structure of vignettes and random incidents is similar to The Big Red One without the periodic voiceover.  Pop songs of the era are matched perfectly to scenes.   Technical aspects are good including the camera work and editing.  There are some memorable images including an eerie scene where the patrol comes upon a charred caravan of vehicles with burned, Iraqi people. <br /> <br />Jarhead is not a perfect film, but it is well acted and pulls no punches on what it must have been like in Iraq. Those looking for an action packed war film will be severely disappointed and let down.  Except for some character inconsistencies, it is a realistic study in the psychological toll that military life takes on a human being. <br /> <br />
B00006399Z|5.0|I first bought this album in a thrift shop in 1973. The sound quality is not great, but this was the strongest line-up of Traffic. It was recorded in London in July 1971, and has the four original band members: Winwood, Mason, Wood and Capaldi; plus Jim Gordon, Rick Grech and Reebop.<br /><br />I saw Traffic play live in '74 and they were disappointing, borderline awful; they seemed tired and bored. On this set they play with considerable energy and the band is tight.<br /><br />Winwood is in excellent form, however the presence of Dave Mason seems to make a difference. In my view Traffic was better with Mason in the band. His guitar playing is excellent and he provides an interesting contrast to Winwood's organ. Jim Gordon demonstrates what a great drummer he was. Capaldi and Reebop provide perussion, and Wood some embellishments here and there.<br /><br />Mason brought with him two very good songs from his recent solo album Alone Together. Also included are Medicated Goo, 40,000 Headmen, Dear Mr Fantasy and Gimme Some Lovin'. Island must have more songs from this concert in the vault, it would be good to hear them.
B000BJS4OY|4.0|Reviewer N.S.R. is right on the money. The remastered CD is a not as good as I thought it would be. The DVD is AWESOME!!!!!<br /><br />It is well worth the $23.99 I paid today at Target, hell I would of paid $100 for the DVD. But instead of including the making of the CD, why not add the Odeon concert on CD to the package. I think MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE WANTED THAT!!!!!!  Is it me? You would think somebody at the record company would have thought of that..........
B000002J03|5.0|This is Zep's 2nd album and a classic listen! <br />This album is one of those albums that created thousand of Led Zeppelin fans. For me, it is a defining moment in Rock history. It is Zeppelin at their best and defines hard, inventive, rock and roll. <br /> <br />With simply magical tracks like \\"Whole Lotta Love', \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\", to fantastic blues-based ripping guitar tracks like \\"Heartbreaker\\", it is an album that never grows old. Many musicians have come and gone, but Led Zeppelin will always be a favorite of the rock/hard-rock music lover. <br /> <br />Jimmy Page's guitar work is fantastic, Robert Plant's voice and lyrics inspiring. Backed by a fantastic rythym section comprised of John Paul Jones and John Bonham. <br /> <br />The result is one of the best, most influential rock albums of all time by one of the best power groups of the 70's. <br /> <br />Young teens need to listen to this album to realize what great rock is. It should be a requirement for anyone who needs to understand what REAL ROCK should sound like. <br /> <br />There will never be another Led Zeppelin and certainly will never be another album like this!
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Like many others I was quite disappointed in the contrived \\"American Life\\" - Madonna's last full-length album which dripped mediocrity and lacked originality, leaving me fearful that the Queen of pop had lost her spark. But luckily 'Confessions on a Dancefloor' lay all prior worries to rest because here she returns to her earlier days, creating irresistibly catchy melodies with soaring synth lines and pulsating dance beats from savory start to satisfying finish (no ballads required). The songs even blend into one another like a club-mix would so the party just keeps going! There's some lush instrumentation thrown in as well, adding emotion to the synthesized rhythms. And I was pleasantly surprised to hear Middle Eastern singing in the beginning of \\"Isaac\\" which bleeds into one of my very favorite tracks, \\"Push\\".<br /><br />Some of the lyrics are a bit corny, like on \\"I Love New York\\" ('I don't like cities but I like New York / Other places make me feel like a dork') but 'Confessions on a Dancefloor' contain some incredibly passionate dance infections - most notably the high-energy \\"Let It Will Be\\" and \\"Jump\\" - all else is excused, making this Madonna's best album since the immaculate 'Ray Of Light'.<br /><br />This may not be flawless but it's a fun, sophisticated dance-pop offering I recommend full-heartedly to new and old fans alike!
B000002JSP|2.0|I've been a true-blue Zep fan since their debut album and have loved every album Led Zeppelin ever put out, including their departures from their signature hard rock sound, ie. (Led Zeppelin III)    The year was 1979. The music of the time was changing with synthesizer-oriented bands like The Cars, Toto, The Police, plus Punk-Rock was making the scene in a big way.    It was a bad time for the power-groups of the 70's, like The Who, Aerosmith, and sadly Led Zeppelin.   I think a lot of the tried and true rockers like Led Zeppelin were going through an identity crisis of trying to \\"fit in\\" with the new, [and in my unrelenting opinion], INFERIOR brand of \\"Rock\\" that was making the radio in those days.   Sadly it affected the power-band's music and Zeppelin was no exception.    I remember waiting with baited breath for Zep's new album. Their last release, \\"Presence\\" with tracks like \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", showed that killer rock was indeed not dead.     Then came \\"In Through The Out Door\\".     I remember being nonplussed, not believing my ears, and as each track played, hoping the next would be better than the previous.     It didn't happen. This wasn't a shift in mood like all the previous Zep albums I had heard. I had always repected and revered Led Zeppelin in their wide diversity of style and mood. Led Zep I, Led Zep III, Physical Graffiti, etc.  That was one of the things that had made me love this band, and other super-talented artists like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, etc.    This was wholly different. As if a new band had replaced Zep, or someone outside the band was writing the songs! It was uninspired, synth-laden, the guitar was a shadow of what I had come to expect from Page, The vocal listless and subdued.    It broke my heart. I felt like Zep was dead. And indeed, the band would soon die, literally, in the wake of drummer John Bonham's death soon afterwards.    DOn't get me wrong. I am not putting Led Zeppelin down. They could do \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" and I'd still listen to it....but...clearly Led Zeppelin seemed lost in the New Wave era of the time.     The songs were uninspired, repititious, synth-laden with minimal guitar efforts and minimal vocal efforts. I was totally depressed about this album. In my humble opinion, Zep had lost it.    They had lost the fire, the excitement, the mystery and the leadership that made them the superstars they were. This album was only a shadow of the former Zeppelin.     This album wasn't a redirection in mood, it was a departure from the Led Zeppelin we'd all grown to revere.     This is why rockers of the time began to seek new bands like Van Halen, The Scorpions, AC/DC, Judas Priest and Rush.    Our Heroes had fallen...    To me, it was the beginning of the end for Led Zeppelin...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is simply unbelievable!  Who would've thought that after a disappointing \\"American Life\\" that an artist could come rocking back through with possibly one of her best albums?  Well many Madonna fans are probably ecstatic over this release, and well justified.  Here's the breakdown: <br />01\\"Hung Up\\" <br />ABBA-sampled, everyone has heard: love it (9/10) <br />02\\"Get Together\\" <br />Love the beat to this song; a bit of trance, a club-friendly vibe splashed with a sampling of the SOS Band (10/10) <br />03\\"Sorry\\" <br />Starting with some very sexy linguistics of the phrase \\"sorry\\" in a multitude of languages, the song grows into a piece of electro-pop confection as quite possibly one of her best songs in years (10/10) <br />04\\"Future Lovers\\" <br />Playing off like an instructional how-to-techno guide for beginners, \\"Lovers\\" then delves head-first into another dimension with its pulsing beats and monotonous vocals (8/10) <br />05\\"I Love New York\\" <br />Rhyming \\"New York\\" with \\"dork\\"??  Lyrically challenged, though there is no denying the pulsating beats. Isn't this what fun dance music is all about? (7/10) <br />06\\"Let It Will Be\\" <br />This song reminds me a lot of \\"Die Another Day\\"; from the strings, to the vocal distortion...hey wait a minute, I see Mirwais on the songwriting credits!  Did I happen to mention \\"DAD\\" is one of my favorite dance songs of hers?  (9/10) <br />07\\"Forbidden Love\\" <br />Nothing like the title on \\"Bedtime Stories\\", the song is more trance than club.  I especially like the countdown into...(8/10) <br />08\\"Jump\\" <br />If you are familar with the \\"Frozen\\" remixes (specifically Stereo MCs) then you will instantly recognize the beat to this one. The song is catchy and radio-friendly (8/10) <br />09\\"How High\\" <br />With the lyrics getting more personal, the song sounds like it was ripped straight from her diary.  Deep and introspective, Stuart Price intertwines the lines using psychadelic voice sampling into the studdering beats.  This one sounds like it would've fit onto \\"Music\\" perfectly (8/10) <br />10\\"Isaac\\" <br />Lots of controversy on this one equals lots of promotion for what is being called the album's centerpiece.  With Arabic chants, Indian beats, reflective lyrics, melodic verses - the song is the \\"Ray Of Light\\" album wrapped into 6 minutes of genius.  Stuart Price deserves a Grammy for this one (12/10)   <br />11\\"Push\\" <br />The thumping bass has still to leave my head from the first time I heard this song.  Madonna fans can recognize similarities to \\"Keep It Together\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\" as well as the original \\"Justify My Love (The Beast Within Mix).  The song, a love song for Guy Ritchie, is touching and sincere and just a great feel-good song for anyone in love.  Best song on the album: (15/10)  <br />12\\"Like It Or Not\\" <br />Madonna at what she does best:  being Madonna.  Is she writing to the critics? fans? cynics? the world?  The beat absolutely rocks; I absolutely agree with the comparison to \\"Personal Jesus\\" from Depeche Mode.  And yeah, \\"Fever\\" anyone? (10/10) <br /> <br />I know I will catch flack for my 2 scores of over 10, but out of all the scores of 10/10, I feel those are the songs that stand out just above those others.  If you're a Madonna fan, you will love this.  If your not, but you enjoy listening to classic dance/disco of the 70s, give this a try.  At age 47, Madonna has not lost a beat and brings us headlong into the sound of future-disco.  All hail the queen!
B000002HMH|4.0|Aint my B****-- This is a cool song! 4/5 <br />2x4-- great! 4/5 <br />house that jack built-- keep it up! 5/6 <br />Until it Sleeps-- the best song here!!! 4/4 <br />king nothing-- AWESOME! 5/5 <br />Hero of the Day-- peesacrap 0/4 <br />Bleeding me-- cool, kinda long 6/8 <br />cure-- excellente 4/4 <br />poor twisted me-- what were they goin for here?? 1/4 <br />wasting my hate-- its pretty cool... 2/3 <br />Mama said-- ayayayay, no way! 0/5 <br />thorn within-- too long for such a small song. 3/5 <br />Ronnie-- it actually sounds coooel. 5/5 <br />the outlaw thorn-- whats with all these thorns??? 8/9 <br />so the full points would be 72... this gets 51. <br />51/72... not bad at all. reminds me of my grades in school or sumtin.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Originally I gave this item 4 stars (well technically, 4-3/4 but this system doesn't allow that).  Well, I totally dont agree with the re-release of an album with bonuses and such, but this is a great album and only got better with the additional tracks, namely \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" and \\"So Lonely\\".  But come on...when are we gonna release the great tracks on the album: \\"One and Only\\" and \\"Stay the Night\\"??  And in the future please stop the over-exhaustion of an album solely to turn a profit (tis the xmas season).
B00005JO1S|2.0|I had no idea that Chris Van Allsburg had written Zathura.  When I saw the trailer for Zathura and heard \\"from the world of Jumanji\\" being advertised, I figured it was just the movie studio trying to reap more money out of Chris Van Allsburg's Jumanji.  When I got to the theatre, I was plesantly suprised to see that it was actually based on a book that Chris Van Allsburg had written.   <br /> <br />The movie started out with overly done bickering brothers who seemed to be bickering for a bit too long by the time the game of Zathura was found in the basement.  In this beginning part of the movie, I was very suprised at two words that were written to come out of a 10 year old's mouth.  It was unexpected and unnecessary.   <br /> <br />The bickering brothers began playing Zathura and realized that they were in outer space after meteors destroy their living room after the first move of the game.  They go and open the door and see that they are floating through an asteroid belt somewhere in outer space, but yet they could breath perfectly, and there was normal earth gravity for the majority of the movie, unless you spit off of the porch, and then the spit would float away.  Each move of the board brought something new, whether it be a malfunctioning robot voiced by Frank Oz (voice of Yoda, Miss Piggy), picking up a stranded astronaught that has been drifting through space for the past 15 years after first playing Zathura, or being attacked by Zorgons.  Speaking of Zorgons, was it just me, or were Zorgons a tribute to a few different movies?  When searching the house, the Zorgons reminded me a whole lot of the raptors from the Jurassic Park movies.  Their ships looked like ships from classic sci-fi movies, but without really thinking about it, it dawned on me that they look a WHOLE lot like the Natalus from 20,000 leagues under the sea, and then in the Zorgon ship itself, there was the tribute to Citizen Kane.  It wasn't exactly Rosebud, but close enough.  I see I'm not the only amazon reviewer that spotted that, but I have a feeling that most people completely missed that.   <br /> <br />Overall, the movie didn't have an original enough story.  It was just Jumanji all over again, only this time in space and with a much smaller (and less famous) cast.  The language and intense scenes did seem way too much for a PG movie as well.  It could have easily been rated PG-13 in my opinion... <br /> <br />
B00007LTIB|5.0|Many people were turned off of Yes after the Double Album Monstrosity of Tales from Topographic Oceans. If Close to the Edge really was close to the edge of reason in Yes' music, Tales really went over the edge. It was HUGE in every way, and mostly fantastic. Well Relayer really shows Yes realizing that they did kind of go over the edge...or they were at \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" dare I say.     What really separates this album from other Yes albums of this magnitude (such as Close to the Edge and Tales) is the fact that is sooo Cohesive. Everything seems to have a unified effect, and it definitely has a unique Yes sound (which is already unique). The Album opens with the Side 1 occupying \\"The Gates of Delirium\\", an epic loosely based on Tolstoy's War and Peace. The lyrics definitely reflect the idea of an impending war followed by a massive instrumental battle (drums and keyboards dueling) and ending with Jon Anderson (Vocals) and Patrick Moraz's (Keyboards) duet of hope entitled \\"Soon\\". This is, in my opinion, Yes' best epic...slightly..EVER so slightly beating Close to the Edge (but maybe not, it really depends on what day it is, you know).     Following Gates, is Sound Chaser, a jazz-fusion-y-Rocker. This is really accented with the sheer power of the music; it's chaotic,   yet at the same time controlled. This is analogous with Steve Howe's savage guitar solo in the middle of the song (separating the two halves). Following Sound Chaser is To Be Over. This song may easily be skipped due to the fact that you are simply out of breath from the first two tracks. However, when you take the time to study this song, it is phenomenal. It is so delicate yet so powerful; it shows Yes' amazing subtleties and powerful songwriting.    This album is most easily comparable to Close to the Edge, due to the fact that it is very similar in structure. It's almost a yes cook book: 1 part Epic, 1 part Rocker, 1 part Softer song, and poof, you have a Yes Masterpiece. The best way to really look at Relayer compared to Close to the Edge is that it is just harder in every way. It is significantly more intense, and complex. Perfect example: Compare the A-capella parts out of Siberian Khatru to Sound Chaser. In Siberian Khatru, its a slow, Da...Da...Da Da Da....Da... DA....da da da...da da da..da .da dada...etc... In Sound Chaser it's an abrasive multi-layerd Da da da DA DA!! Da da da DA DA!!!. No space what-so-ever. Just all power. There is a microcosm for Close to the Edge compared to Relayer It isn't necessarily better than Close to the Edge, its just yes in a heavier light. It may be more appealing to the...say Dream Theater and Mars Volta fan, while Close to the Edge is more appealing to the OSI, Porcupine Tree crowd.     For the musicians out there, this is an impressive work. Chris Squier's Basslines are just as funky and powerful as ever. Steve Howe's guitar work is unbelieveable (noteably on Sound Chaser). Alan White's underrated playing is more developed, confident, and powerful than on Tales, and has a more fusion trend than Bill Bruford's (a jazz guy).    In any way you look at it, Relayer is one of Yes' most cohesive, structured, astonishing works, easily comparable to Close to the Edge and Tales from Topographic Oceans. Essential Yes.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I've always loved Madonna. She is one of the most( if not the most) inventive, creative and consistent artists of our time. \\"Hung Up\\" the lead single from \\"Confessions On a Dance Floor\\" is simply mesmerizing! <br /> <br /> The ABBA sample works really well with the overall theme of the song ,  the lyrics are catchy and almost anyone can relate to the subject matter. <br /> <br />One of the things I love about this album is that it makes you feel good when you hear it. There are no breaks, no boundaries,  just one amazing song segueing into the next.  <br /> <br />Some of the songs seem a little repetitive but that's only because this is a \\"dance\\" record. If you are looking for sappy, romantic dry ballads you will be very disappointed with album. <br /> <br />The album starts out lighthearted and fun, then progressively gets more personal, intense,  confessional (if you will). Madonna's writing prowess is probably her most under-rated quality. When you listen to songs like \\"Get Together\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", and \\"Issac\\" you can feel where she's coming from because the lyrics are so vivid, buoyant and true to life.  <br /> <br />It's as if the music takes over your body and you can't help but to shake your groove thang! <br /> <br />All in all, Confessions On A Dance floor exceeded my expectations. Madonna has redeemed herself from the disappointing \\"American Life' and has blessed us music lovers with timeless, classic dance music that will mover your body, mind and sprit for many years to come. Check it out!!! <br /> <br />Highlights: <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\" <br /> <br />\\"Get Together\\" <br /> <br />\\"Forbidden Love\\" <br /> <br />\\"Issac\\" <br />
B00004W50T|5.0|The Band was a bad ass bar band to begin with. Then they became a bad ass backing band for Bob Dylan. In 1967 they decided to become a bad ass recording band that went by the name of The Band. Music from the Big Pink was the first album that these guys ever recorded, and it is quite obvious that they deeply engaged themselves in the project.<br />Now, I will tell you that if you are looking for that bad ass bar band sound this is not your album. That would be the second album simply titled THE BAND. Here, these guys were looking to create a masterpiece for their debut. Well, create it they did.<br />love,lust,revenge,deception,murder.... vanerial disease, it's all covered in this albums circus(for lack of a better word) environment.<br />The album is very mellow, soft yet dark. Its really beautiful music, that is WAY more mature than anything else on the rock circuit in 1967. AND THESE WERE CRAZY GUYS MAKING THIS STUFF!<br />A few of these songs were co-written with Bob Dylan, there are a couple cover tunes, but as an album it is one tight unit. One solid body of work. THINKING MANS MUSIC!<br />My favorites are The Weight, Chest Fever and The Long Black Veil.<br /><br />If you are looking for some ecclectic sounds on a very thought provoking piece of work, suprisingly written and performed by wild animals, then this is your disc.
B0000027RL|5.0|The title to this review pretty much says it all.  This is one of the very best albums ever recorded.  There is not a single bad song on the record that started the careers of one of music's most enduring bands of the recent era.  Ten is a showcase of the musical tallents of Stone Gossard, Mike McCreedy, Jeff Ament, and the striking vocals of one of my all time favorite singers Eddie Vedder.  Oh yeah, they had a drummer too, but what was his name?  Who can remember, they've had three or four since.  But all in all, Ten can be listened to entirely, without skipping a single song, and in comparison to their other albums, is the best, and I <br />love them all.  Black may be one of the best songs ever written, and I mean ever.  Not to do injustice to any of the other tracks,but Black is just perfect in every way.  If you haven't heard this album, all I want to ask is where have you been?  And if that happens to be the case, go buy it.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I must say, I was not at all looking forward to hearing another TIRED Madonna cd!  BUT.......I was very surprised when I first played the cd.  I actually liked it!  There are a couple of songs in there that I may have to get used to.......but what a way to start.......Hung Up is a great start to a great cd.  I did not give her enough credit for still HAVING IT!  But she proves here that she does still know how to make us get up and go!
0679422714|1.0|[...] <br /> <br />Luding-qiao Iron Chain Bridge  <br />In Western Sichuan Province, Liu Wenhui, after a defeat in the hands of his nephew Liu Xiang, had retreated to the neighboring Xi-kang Province [now being parts of Sichuan & Tibet] with about 20,000 remnants out of his original force of 120,000 soldiers. Chiang Kai-shek had appointed Liu Wenhui the post of \\"director for Xi-kang pacification office\\". Liu Wenhui, though retaining the serial number of 24th Corps and inventing some extra division and multiple brigade numbers, still could not expand above 20,000 headcounts due to the economic limitations of the garrison region. In this area, Chiang Kai-shek had dispatched to Ya'an and Hanyuan some unit of Kang Ze's first contngent of special operation force [i.e., a guerilla fighting force that were deployed in Japanese-occupied territories after 1937]. Under pressure from both KMT Central and the communist threats, Liu Wenhui ordered that Xi-kang border commander Liu Yuanzhang deploy the brigades of Liu Yuantang, Liu Yuanzong, Xu Jianshang, Deng Xiuting and Liu Yuanxuan, about 12 falsified regiments, to the Jin-sha [golden sand] River, while having Yuan Guorui & Yang Xuerui brigades of 5th Division guard the Dadu [grand crossing] River. Yu Songlin's brigade was dispatched to the upperstream Dadu River. To secure a scapegoat, Liu Wenhui called upon a retired officer called Chen Guangzao for organizing a so-called 5th Division under his 24th Corps.  <br />  <br />On April 29th, Red Army Central Front defeated Liu Yuantang's brigade and crossed the Jin-sha [golden sand] River at Longjiedu & Jiaopingdu crossings. At Huili city, Liu Yuantang withdrew all surrounding forces for a defence. Three days later, Red Army descended upon Huili, but after seven days and seven nights, failed to sack the city. Chiang Kai-shek ordered an airdrop of a bonus of 10,000 yuan as a bonus to Liu Yuantang and conferred the title of brigadier-general onto Liu Yuantang. Having failed to sackthe city, Red Army then went north and defeated Xu Jianshang's brigade. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek ordered that Liu Yuantang command Liu Wenhui's 24th Corps for defending the north bank of Dadu River and Yang Sen command Liu Xiang's 20th Corps as well as part of 21st Corps to the relief of Liu Yuanzhang. On May 14th 1935, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Liu Wenhui with instructions as to defence of Dadu [Tadu] River and threat of court martial for any dereliction of duty.  <br />  <br />Meanwhile, on May 15th, Red Army split into two routes after passing Xichang, with Zuo Quan and Liu Yalou leading Red Army 1st Corps-conglomerate for the Dashubao crossing, and Liu Bocheng & Nie Rongzhen penetrating the Yi-zu minority domain for the Anshuchang crossing on the west ban of Dadu River. In the path of the two Red Army contingents would be Chen Guangzao and his newly-organizd 5th Division of 24th Corps. Chen Guangzao managed to recruit about 50 former soldiers and officers in total. Sitting in Ya'an, Division Chief Chen Guangzao dispatched deputy division chief Chen Nengfen and tactician Ye Jianming to Hanyuan for leading the Dadu defence. Chen Nengfen and Ye Jianming, after arriving at Hanyuan, found out that they had no soldiers or guns at Hanyuan. Li Quanshan, i.e., so-called 38th regiment chief of 4th brigade under the empty-shell 5th Division of 24th Corps was sent to Luding Iron Chain Bridge. Li Quanshan and his followers ran their way to the bridge by the evening of May 28th. Since locals refused to destroy the chains, Li Quanshan ordered that his barehand soldiers dismantle the wooden planks. Under rainy weather, Li Quanshan's soldiers soon stopped their work for smoking pipe. Luding Bridge, with thirteen chains, built in 1701 under Manchu reign, measures about 100 meters long and 2.8 meters wide.  <br />  <br />Overnight, Zuo Quan and Liu Yalou's contingent ran their way towards the iron chain bridge on the relatively flat path of the east bank, while Liu Bocheng& Nie Rongzhen's contingent marched slowly on the west bank towards the same target. At one time, Zuo Quan and Liu Yalou met with the relief army of Sichuan Provincial Army across the river and pretended to be of same camp by flashing the torch light. While Liu Bocheng & Nie Rongzhen chased up the Sichuan provincial relief army on the west bank, Zuo Quan and Liu Yalou's contingent, with machinegun overpowering the west end of the Luding Iron Bridge, organized a 22 member commando team at day break. With a loss of several soldiers, Yang Chengwu's assault team succeeded in overwpowering the badly-equipped Li Quanshan gang. Mao Tse-tung and the bulk of Red Army Central Front, probably numbering far less than 7000-9000 at this time, would cross the suspension bridge on May 30th. Thereafter, Red Army Central Front went towards Tianquan for their next target of the Long March, i.e., union with Zhang Guotao's Red Army Fourth Front of close to 100,000 soldiers.  <br />  <br />Li Zongren signed that it was the Heaven which had allowed Mao Tse-tung cross the river where Shi Dakai, i.e., King Yi-wang of Taiping Heavenly Kingdon, had been doomed. What Li ZOngren did not fully realize is that Red Army had already taken control of the Anshunchang Crossing in lowerstream Dadu River, thus averting Shi Dakai's fate of death with his son and followers at Anshunchang. The related myth of communist using humand shield being another fallacy, Jung Chang & Jon Halliday's wild claim that Chiang Kai-shek had let go the Reds with a cart of supplies and map was not worthy of refutation by this webmaster.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I bought the non-stop mix version of this release and haven't stopped listening to it since. I'm a huge trance/dance fan and enjoy the layers and high production values of \\"Confessions.\\" The music here NEVER gets boring and Madonna's lush voice complements the beats and hooks perfectly. \\"I love NY\\" and \\"Let It Will Be\\" are standouts - though there's not a song that falls below the \\"really good\\" level. Go, Madonna! You've done it again and again and again...
B000002MFN|5.0|Well, next to her debut album, at any rate.  Yes, this is EROTICA, the darkest, sexiest album of Madonna's long-lasted careear.  Filled with wonderful house/RnB beats and brought to life with sultry lyrics, EROTICA flows beautifully from start to finish.  True, there are a few fillers (\\"Thief of Hearts\\" and \\"In This Life\\"), but there is only one completely worthless track on this disc--the extra \\"Did You Do It?\\" which should have been replaced by the cool, savvy, and now rare \\"Goodbye to Innocence.\\"  Nevertheless, this stands as Madonna's least appreciated body of evidence...erm, body of work.  Let's go through each song, shall we? <br />1. \\"Erotica\\"  ~ I was a child when this song came out, but even then I knew it was \\"dirty\\" and therefore interesting.  Awesome beats that outshine the tawdry \\"Justify My Life\\" occur throughout this track, while Madonna breathes and whispers.  An altogether sexy, frigid song that is simply wonderful!  10/10 <br />2. \\"Fever\\"  ~ I actually prefer this version to the much-loved video cut.  The beats are sharp, and Madonna's voice is high-pitched yet still sexy--yes, I have to use that adjective many times to describe this CD.  The song is fluffy, oldie pop, but it's quite catchy.  8/10 <br />3. \\"Bye Bye Baby\\"  ~ Meh, not my favourite, but it's still rather cute in a cheesy early 90's way.  6/10 <br />4. \\"Deeper and Deeper\\"  ~ My all-time favorite Madonna dance track.  Yes, everything I love about Madonna is encapsulated on this one song:  catchy beats, hooky chorus/melody, veiled lyrics, etc.  Her voice has never sounded this deep, this powerful before.  One of her best songs--ever.  11/10 <br />5. \\"Where Life Begins\\"  ~ Another sexy track about a taboo subject.  I'll leave you to guess what it's about... 10/10 <br />6. \\"Bad Girl\\"  ~ This song should *never* have been released as a single, but it really is a decent semi-ballad.  The following song or \\"Why's It So Hard\\" should have been chosen instead, though.  7/10 <br />7. \\"Waiting\\"  ~Smooth hip-hop beats with rough lyrics sung and spoken only as Madonna can do.  Nice song.  8/10 <br />8.  \\"Thief of Hearts\\"  ~ Cheesy filler...only it *does* have a cool club beat.  4/10 <br />9. \\"Words\\"  ~ Slick, understated, and subdued, this unassuming track is one of the strongest on the album--lyrically and musically.  10/10 <br />10. \\"Rain\\"  ~ Ah, one of her immortal ballads.  A very worthy track, indeed.  I remember hearing this on the radio all the time back in '93ish.  10/10 <br />11. \\"Why's It So Hard\\"  ~ What a wonderful empowerment anthem/song!  With its catchy chorus, lovely beats, and simple message, this song *should* have been chosen as a follow-up single to \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper.\\"  Oh, well.  10/10 <br />12. \\"In This Life\\"  ~ Yes, this is a touching song about one of her close friends who had died of AIDS, yet it calls to a halt the energy set in motion by the previous track.  Yes, even though I enjoy listening to it occasionally, I feel it drags the album in a dull manner most of the time.  5/10 <br />13.  \\"Did You Do It?\\"  ~ I do *not* consider this to be part of the album proper.  I always skip it without fail.  0/10 <br />14.  \\"Secret Garden\\"  ~ EROTICA closes perfectly with this little jazzy number.  I love the lyrics and the cleansing effect this song has after listening to the rest of the album.  10/10 <br />Overall, this album, one of Madonna's longest, exhausts one after listening to it in its entirety (well, minus \\"Did You Do It?\\"), yet it's well worth the effort.  Madonna obviously put her heart and soul into making this splended set of songs, and *her* effort shows through each track.  I still believe Madonna reached her apex during the early 90's--no one was more glamorous, more of a star than she.  She really broke the barriers that had restrained sex in the media, yet she did so with class and taste unlike today's pop trash.  The music is brilliant, far superior and much more mature than what she had done previously.  I heartily recommend EROTICA to anyone interested in Madonna and good--yes, *good*--90's dance/pop music that's slightly off-kilter.  Enjoy!
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I loooove this disc.  I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I could've.
0307276902|5.0|This book was absolutely unforgettable. My brother suffers from a drug addiction and this really helped me see his struggle from the inside out.  I commend James Frey for his beautiful book, his personal heartaches and triumphs.  He must be an incredible person to know personally.  <br />I read \\"My Friend Leonard\\" right after \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" and I was so heartbroken for him when Lily died.  Read both of his books.  He doesn't glamorize drug addiction like alot of rock stars in their autobiographies, he tells it like it is with all the pain and hurt.   <br />All the best of luck to James and his family.  I am glad he found happiness.
0895260131|1.0|An uninformed book which preaches and encourages that hate it claims to chronicle. \\"Jihad,\\" in Islam is not a call for physical fighting but rather a fight against ones own base desires and the temptations of the world to do good and achieve what is entrusted to mankind. Islam clearly states that there is \\"no compulsion in religion.\\" As I clearly demonstrated in the great Islamic empires each religious fraction was allowed to be judged by its own people laws and standards and no one was forced to convert or act against their will. In fairness the disbelievers had to pay a special tax, but this was nothing compared with the torture people of different faiths endured in the Europe of that time. I feel a mix of anger and sadness reading the reviews of the people on this site. I would have liked to assume that the literate persons of the west would have a more educated understanding of the religion that dominates much of the world a vast array o geographies and nationalities. In Islam it is expressly forbidden for one to kill themselves or innocent civilians. Radical Islam is the result f proud and powerless uneducated and brutal souls seeking empowerment in a constantly diminished and antagonized position. A war against Islam is not winnable as it only further enforces and radicalizes the opposition. It should be the responsibility of those of us who know better to help and teach and to rest our temptation to define categorize patronize and define ourselves against an evil and hopeless enemy. We are all people we must try and remember to consider that it requires the same conviction feeling for all people to act, this is as true for \\"those people,\\" as it is for ourselves. If peace is our ultimate goal as a collective community stupid works like this only set us back and solidify our positions as enemies.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Although I initially expected a much stronger score for the new \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", and was a bit surprised by the softer side it seems to take, I do really like the score.  Having bought the soundtrack from Amazon UK over a month ago, and having seen two screenings of the new \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" film in the last two weeks, I can rightfully say that the music really flows well with the film, and never overpowers it. It circles, entwines, prods, calms and flows: always appropriate and always divine. <br /> <br />The beautiful tracks like \\"Meryton Townhall\\" or \\"Another Dance\\" where they dance a lively tune, or the aptly named \\"Militia Marches In\\" with a nice military feel...\\"The Secret Life of Daydreams\\" is beautiful: the wonderfully haunting \\"Your Hands Are Cold,\\" and \\"Mrs. Darcy\\" has a nice build and feel...for those of you who do English Country Dance/Regency Dance like me, you find yourself looking for the tune for \\"Mr. Beveridge's Maggot\\" (which is what Elizabeth & Darcy dance to in the 1995 version), instead you will find \\"A Postcard to Henry Purcell\\", which is haunting, mellow & beautiful in its own right.  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks, \\"Liz on Top of the World,\\" builds to a more strong tone, and has a gorgeous feel and \\"Your Hands Are Cold\\" is both strong and soft, loving and harsh, and is I feel, the best track in the film: the imagery in the film that goes along with it is beautiful, and complements each other well. All in all, a highly recommended score to go along with a highly recommended film! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|1.0|This is all I can confess... Not as brilliant as the previous ones... Mariah should go back to her roots (see Madonna, she had that clever instinct at least)... Mariah, wake up !
B000B8QEZG|5.0|For all those critics out there who bash on Madonna you need to quit being jealous and realize how brilliant this woman is!  I've been a fan since the 80's when I first heard \\"Borderline\\" and I love how Madonna is always pushing the envelope and \\"Re-inventing\\" herself.  This cd is by far one of the best I've heard from anyone in a long time!  \\"Hung Up\\" is a catchy tune with the sampling of ABBA's \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme\\" that's bound to get anyone up and dancing.  \\"I Love New York\\" is brilliant and an ode to the place she found her fame and herself.  I recommend this cd to anyone.  My friends who have never been a fan of her music are definitely fans after this cd!  Cheers!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna has never produced a better dance music... She's just goes beyond expectations. Brilliant, a must have for all the pop lovers !!!!!!!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to say, Madonna tore it up this time around. Her last album, \\"American Life\\" was complete garbage. She finally made an album with some substance. It's so good!!...and to those of you who disagree, please. IT'S NOT TECHNO!! get your genre's right. I can't stand techno...this is dance/pop at it's best, not techno trash! So know what your talking about before you get on here and write a review.
B000B8QF14|4.0|This CD/DVD is very amazing. I am one of the big Green Day fans, so I have a pretty good knowledge of their touring style and what songs they play. I have seen them twice in the American Idiot tour, but I noticed they cut out 5 songs from their setlist which really disappointed me. \\"Jaded\\", \\"Knowledge\\", \\"She\\", \\"Maria\\", and \\"We Are the Champions\\" are cut out. Also, I think that the interviews in between the songs really cet you carried away from watching the show. Another disappointing factor is too much special effects. I really wasn't really fond of that. On the bright side, this show was an amazing event. They really know how to put an awesome performance. There are a few funny parts in it during the performance and also during the interviews. Bonus material is a gallery of the band from the performance and in the background is an album version of \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" playing without Billie Joe singing.

B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie has to be the worst movie I have seen for a long time!  The plot was horrible, the entire setup was terrible.  I almost fell asleep in this.  Horrible!!  Seriously, there are people that like this?  Get a life!
B00005JNX0|3.0|My kids saw this movie like three times at the theater.  They swore up and down that it was hysterically funny.  Kewel...  I never got the chance to see it, so when the DVD came out yesterday I snatched it up, of course.  Well, my children and I watched it first thing when I got home from work and I gotta say... it was not hysterically funny.  In fact, it seemed really pushed and formulaic.  I like Ben Stiller most of the time and Chris Rock and David Scwimmer was perfet for the hypochodriac giraffe, but it seemed forced.  The penguins were funny...as were the lemurs.  It just felt middle-of-the-road for me.  I usually enjoy animated movies with my kids (we own every Disney DVD) and I did enjoy this one, just not that much.  Kind of a disappointment.  See for yourself.  Maybe I was just tired, but I doubt that.  I know funny and it did garner a few chuckles from me, but this is not knock-down-drag-out funny.  (See Monty Python's Holy Grail for that or Spinal Tap or The Emperor's New Groove for that matter....)  Overall...bland.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000006MS3|5.0|\\"The Dreaming\\" is what it is - a dream! It is also a musical explosion, a complete extroversion of Kate Bush after her first three albums. Nothing could have warned you against it, certainly not \\"Lionheart\\" og \\"The Kick Inside\\". <br /> <br />Kate is dreaming her life. Someone is trying to touch her for the first time. She dream that she is part of the gang (\\"There Goes A Tenner\\"), that she is the girlfriend of a spy or a lone aircraft warrior (\\"Night Of The Swallow\\"). She could be the lover / assistant of Houdini (\\"Houdini\\") or she dream that she is dying (\\"All The Love\\"). <br /> <br />But someone is tocuhing her, and she is frighten in a most delightfull way (\\"Get Out Of My House\\"). This is first, burning hot love, uncontrollable, explosive, scary. Nobody, nobody has sung like this before - she is screaming her hart out, and I swear, I was completely thrown up against the wall! <br /> <br />And she is ready, after all! \\"Leave It Open\\" says so - she is longing in an almost improper way. This is sex, ready to unfold for the man she wants / don't want. <br /> <br />Seen in retrospective, the record is a turning point for Kate Bush. There is now absolutely no return back to the innocense that was portrayed in for example \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\" from The Kick Inside. Kate has becomes a full-grown woman now - not a girl anymore - and the following albums continues this growth. <br /> <br />Can you do such an album today? <br />I don't think so!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|After the success of Fargo, the Coen brothers decided to make a movie centered around bowling....hmmmmm.  This might have been a distraction to those who would have necessarily watched anything that the Coen's put out.  I'll admit that I didn't take to The Big Lebowski in the theaters and didn't really think about watching it when it became a rental at Blockbuster all those years ago.  And then fate was on my side one day when I ran across the DVD in the cheapy rack at Wal-Mart.  Seemed mildly interesting.  I like Jeff Bridges and John Goodman and it was done by the guys who made Fargo which I enjoyed enormously.  Sooo...I went home and watched it.  Well, I gotta tell you, The Big Lebowski is on my Top-Ten list of all time favorites.  Unbelievably funny.  You will hurt yourself laughing.  Definitely have to watch it more than once to get all the subtle humor.  This movie rox on every level.  John Goodman is hysterical as the psycho-bowler Walter and Jeff Bridges is great as The Dude.  So sit back, pop open an oat soda, and enter the world of carpet-pissers, trophy wives, bums and bowlers.  Excellent film-making and in my opinion the Coen Bros. best effort.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Hey Sony music haters \\"get over it\\". This package is awsome, with some great never before seen photos and live video footage that will blow your mind. We want and want and want and we, I finally got. The Hamersmith Odeon show is out of this world, the E Street band is so young and you can see that they were going for broke. A great version of Kitty's Back and the E street shuffle. And!! And!!! we get three songs on dvd of Bruce in '73 doing a fantastic version of Thundercrack, a song that was never on any album until Tracks,some 30 years later. Bruce is just now starting to release some old stuff so let's all be cool and patient and I belive we will get on the unreleased stuff we have ever dreamed of. The Born to Run album sounds great and the packagae is well done. BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCE!!!!!!
B00008CLOA|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon (1973.), Pink Floyd's eighth studio album<br /><br />There has never been and never will be a band quite like Pink Floyd. Over their extensive career, the prog. rock quartet of Dave Gilmour (guitar), Roger Waters (bass), Rick Wright (keyboards) and Nick Mason (drums) have made a legendary contribution to rock music (I've also not forgotten original frontman Syd Barratt in that list). The band tried out more than their fair share of new ideas and in many ways paved the way in pushing the boundaries of music. All of the band's albums are quite popular, but none more so than 'Dark Side Of The Moon' which is heralded as the Floyd's greatest work and one of the greatest albums of all time. This album has shifted more units than any other rock album ever made (sales are over 40 millions units I think!). So is this album really deserving of its great popularity and also, why is it just that bit special?<br /><br />For me, there is no question, this is Pink Floyd's ultra-definitive album and also their finest album - other hardcore Floyd fans may disagree and choose 'Wish You Were Here' or 'The Wall' by preference but I think that this tops them both. Pink Floyd, up to this point had amazingly demonstrated their great potential, none more so than in their great 1971 release, 'Meddle'. With that album, you could sense that the band were on the brink of producing a true masterpiece and here you have it, the ultimate masterpiece from the band in 'Dark Side Of The Moon'. Everything comes together on this album; the songs run cohesively and perfectly from one to the next and the songwriting is literally awesome. It should come as no surprise that all of the band members had songwriting inputs on the album (rather than the sole Waters dominance that would come in later albums) and this further demonstrates why this album is so good. It often amazes me that there are people around today who are more than willing to bash this album. I constantly hear comments such as 'It sounds dated' or 'This music makes me fall asleep'. These people (probably listeners to senseless nu metal, emo crap or anything else thats abysmal in music in recent times) never fail to amaze me; I don't know what stuff they must be on to make them so diluded! At my last check, this album was made over 30 years ago ... YES 30 YEARS. People are quick to diss the techniques that Pink Floyd used on this album to make various effects but at the time it was completely new and revolutionary - they didn't have the latest digital recording studio to help them out! That aside, the various styles the band use on the album for me still sound fantastic and fresh. Gilmour's guitar work is first rate, as are his vocals. Waters' bass play is beautifully resonant throughout and the keyboard work by Wright is fantastic. With that all aside, it is the lyrical concept that really makes this album so good. Pink Floyd take you through an amazing conceptual journey on this album, and one that you never tire of. The all too realisitic themes of loss of time, war, madness and death are in this album. The band tackle a whole load of themes in this 40 minute album; you can't not be emotionally moved by it. This is why the album has appealed to so many over time; the album's concept driven, experimental but ultimately polished and structured style is what makes it shine so much. The album has so many sides to it and you notice something new with every listen. Who also could miss the cover; the prism effect front is simple but an amazing eye-catcher.<br /><br />The journey of the 'Dark Side Of The Moon' begins with opener 'Speak To Me/Breathe'. The opening part of the song opens up with a showcase of the effects to come; mad voices, a woman screaming, cash tills and everything else all cleverly mix together (note all the voices you hear on the album were workers at the recording studio who had their reponses recorded when they were asked about madness). This then runs into the start of the proper music, firstly with the classic guitar and bass line for the album followed by a couple of verses of harsh and brutal lyrics. 'On The Run', is a clever track with a racing electronic sound which was created by speeding a note sequence on a tape loop - there's plenty more effects added in on this track. Then we come to the album's first epic in 'Time'. A surpise entrance of ringing bells kick starts this one. Gilmour's crunching guitar chords alongside some echoing drumming give this song an atmospheric build up. This then becomes a lyrically amazing song, with themes on time slipping away and growing old. Gilmour's guitar solo is brilliant; as is the 'Breathe' (reprise) song exit. Following this great track is the closing song for side one with 'Great Gig In The Sky'. Rick Wright's gentle piano chords are superbly contrasted by the passionate, emotional and evocative wails by singer Clair Torry, who the band hired for the song. The song is like nothing I've heard before.<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with the album's most famous song. Who could fail to recognise the unique cash-machine sounds at the start of the song. Rhythmically, this song is weird as it is written in 7/4 time, as opposed to the 4/4 standard. However, this time signature paves the way for the songs classic bass line. The lyrics, based around corporate wealth, greed and acquisition are classic, as is the middle section with plenty of roaring guitars. 'Us And Them' follows; perhaps the album's most heartfelt song. Based on the theme of outrage at the continuation of the Vietnam war, this song is powerful. The keyboard work is imaginitive and the saxophone solo is brilliant. 'Any Colour You Like' is next. This one is experimental where Gilmour tries his hand at some quirky guitar play over some great keyboard dubs. The madness theme of 'Brain Damage' is next up which looks at the mental damage caused to war casualties. This is another foreboding song with a brutal and realistic edge. Finally, to close this epic album is 'Eclipse'. A short, punchy finish with plenty of contrasting lyrics building to a climax. The heartbeat at the end cleverly trails the album to a finish, in the style just like it began.<br /><br />'Dark Side Of The Moon' is an epic musical journey through the tragedies of life. Pink Floyd were at their absolute peak with this album and the work is never short of inspired moments. This album is perfect; everything comes together both musically and lyrically. Plenty of people have this album but still, if you don't then this is a MUST buy. This album is not just the place to begin a Pink Floyd collection, it is the place to begin a good music collection in general. Trust me, and all the other high rated reviews for this album, this album is well worth the money you will pay for it and the time you will spend listening to it! (excuse the puns!)<br /><br />EXTRA NOTE: 'Dark Side Of The Moon' was issued in an SACD format some time ago. If you have the technology for SACD formats then this is the version you may want to get. I personally don't know what the quality is like with that version and I've heard a mixture of positive and negative feedback alike about it.<br /><br />MY RATING: 10/10; a classic that rises above the restfirstly with the classic guitar and bass line for the album followed by a couple of verses of harsh and brutal lyrics.

1400032717|4.0|Once again, this book was referred to me by my fiancee.  Really enjoyed the first part of the book, how the author gets inside the mind of an autistic child- perceptive, concrete thinking, obsessive-compulsive, number-oriented.  I've never read anything like this before. <br />  For some reason, I abandoned this book 70 pages from the finish line.  I put it down for a little while, then just completely lost interest in it.  It was a good book, but there was nothing in it which compelled me to complete it.  One of the few books I didn't see through to the end. <br />  Bottom line:  I do recommend this book, if for no other reason than it really helps you to understand how the autistic child thinks/view the world.  A quick read.
B000001F7Y|4.0|The album's story is a great one of struggling musicians who put out their music and gets enough airplay in the U.S. to get them signed to a major-label deal.  The strengths of this album are the first and last tracks, which are classics of the AOR era.  The middle part is pretty good, but poor Geddy insists on making up for a perceived weakness in his voice by overuse of cheesy echo effects, which sadly date this perfomance to the arena rock era of the '70s.  Take that away and this could be something released tomorrow by some cutting-edge up-and-coming rock group.  You can plainly hear the influences, and at the same time hear the potential that resides within some of the songs, which hint of things to come.
0385720920|5.0|Saw the movie fight club, loved it, but didn't want to read the book now that I know the ending.  So I picked up this one instead. <br />  Chuck Palahniuk has such an in-your-face writing style, you can't help but be drawn into the story line.  You don't know whether to pity or hate the protagonist, but the story line is just so interesting you have to keep flipping the pages. <br />  As in Fight Club, there is a twist at the end of the tale...so good.  The main character is downright dirty, disgusting, and immoral on many levels.  So believable though, so unique. <br />  Bottom line:  If you're a fan of Fight Club, you will love this book.  If you're not a fan of Fight Club, you will most likely still love this book.  Read it.
B00005A46U|5.0|Wow! I had forgotten just how great this album really is. I put on the remastered cd last night with a good pair of headphones and was instantly transported back in time. Beautiful melodies smoothly but quite unexpectedly segue into hard-hitting (though highly structured) jams that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Dave Sinclair's keyboards absolutely rock while the rest of the band cooks right along with him. The addition of Jimmy Hastings' flute and sax adds so much colour and depth to the extended pieces--top notch playing all around! I really love the \\"Englishness\\" of the vocals and lyrics, with their typically understated humour and charm. What else can I say? Together with \\"In The Land of Grey and Pink\\" this is the best stuff Caravan ever did, though \\"For Girls Who Grow...\\" is pretty close in overall quality and intensity. It's worth mentioning that the sound quality of the remastered disc is quite good (Richard Sinclair's bass sounds wonderful and I have a whole new appreciation for Richard Coughlan's excellent drumming) and the liner notes are insightful and interesting. Sorry for gushing, but I'm still on a cloud after hearing this again for the first time in quite awhile. Hurry and get it and be sure to buy a copy for a good friend. They'll love you for it. Cheers!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Who knew that confessing could bring such a refreshing experience?  Madonna presents to us a dance/disco album that makes you wanna dust off the strobe light, crank up the volume, and put the disco ball in rotation honey.  Positive messages, energetic beats, & pure audio bliss is how i personally describe \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor.\\"  The fluid flow from one song to the next is a great transition.  I have seen some negativity going on about her newest musical creation, but please listen and judge for yourself.  In depth Madonna fans will love this cd.  This lady is in her mid 40's, is married, has 2 kids, and can still artistically churn out music like nobody's business.  As they say, don't hate the player, hate the game: and Madonna is the proverbial queen on the music industry chessboard.  Play on Madge!
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I don't know why some people gave bad comments about that series.  I understand people who already bought earlier series and spent more but overall it's a very good price deal for family collection.  I rate 10 stars for Friends.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Kudos to you again Madonna! I love this album.  I love how your taste changes with each album.  I have been with you from the very beginning and this album is by far going to be one of my favorites.  I love the continuous music. As I am running on the treadmill listening to the upbeat disco type beats,  I am finding I want to run harder and faster.  This music is uplifting.  \\"Sorry\\" is awesome. It was a great 'in your face' to all the past bad relationships that went wrong.  Thanks! You are a remarkable artist who has come so far.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I bought the 40th Anniversary Edition because I had heard that the picture was improved over previous versions (I also own the 5 Star Collectors Edition).  I have to say that this is true.  The new version has a much cleaner picture with less noise and more vivid color than the previous one.  The language choices features an \\"English 5.0 Surround\\" track (no .1 subwoofer track, I guess, although this film doesn't need a lot of bass).  The previous version I own has 4.1 surround.  Add to that many more special features, and I think the 40th Anniversary Edition is one that you will want to add to your collection even if you already own another version of it.  For me, the much improved picture makes it worth the extra cost.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I really enjoyed the CD. People who think that it will sound like her stuff from the 80's don't really know much about Madonna and the evolution of her music. I think that while it harkens back to her producing a completely dance-oriented CD, the music itself marries 70's disco with techo with really good results. Push Me, Sorry, Let it Will Be, and Jump are standouts.
B000AL730O|5.0|This album really marks a return to form for Sir Paul.  The sound of the album harks back to The Beatles \\"White album\\", while still managing to look forward.  \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"Too Much Rain\\" are the standouts for myself, although there really isn't a weak track to be found.  It's a much stronger and more enjoyable album than \\"Driving Rain\\" his previous effort.  McCartney has had some great classic albums...\\"McCartney\\", \\"Band on the Run\\", \\"Tug Of War\\", \\"Flaming Pie\\", Not to mention every album from The Beatles.  If you are a longtime McCartney fan this album is for you.  If you love the Beatles you need this album.  It ranks among the best McCartney can offer.  And what an offering it is...
B000BGH22W|5.0|It seems strange that some fans are so narrow minded that they cannot be open to a new composer. The soundtrack itself is marture and does not depend on a strong thematic through-line unlike the previous three films, which was for me always something necessary for the young audience. It should also be noted that themes had always been the strength from Williams, whose music bears similiarities to Wagner. Doyle instead chose to capture the mood of scenes and he does a splendid job.The overall tone of the soundtrack is dark, ominous and brooding. The book is dark, and so is the score. Doyle's music completely reflects the source material (unfortunately I have read in quite a few early reviews that it does not reflect the movie because Mike Newell butchered it, which is a shame). The score is original and new and should be given a chance by everyone.  I really hope that Mr. Doyle will score the next movies because things will only get darker with each passing book and the jolly score from Williams is rather out of place now. My only wish for the future would be a tiny bit of thematic development and no songs at the end. They distroy the mood completely and should be skipped.
0345409671|5.0|This was one of the most popular of the Vampire Chronicles, but I fear one of the most unappreciated books in the series, and perhaps one of her most unappreciated novels altogether (which by the way I don't understand). <br />This book takes the reader where they've never been before, and Anne Rice does it brilliantly. It's a rollercoaster of a ride, and the final destination leaves the reader (or at least it left me) wanting more, but at best, being fulfilled until the next book in the series. Definately worth reading over and over again.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Yes, the Queen of Pop has finally returned to her rightful throne. When I first heard this CD I thought,\\"Omigod! This is soooooo much better then 'American Life'!\\" 'Hung Up' starts off this delightful, beautiful, dance-til-you-drop masterpiece that every Madonna fan has been waiting for. The Abba beat brings back old times, as well as new dance beats we all enjoy. The rest of 'Confessions' is just as entertaining if not mesmerizing in its sound. 'Sorry', 'Push', and my personal fav,'Issac' are some of the songs you'll push repeat on many times. Like I said earlier, The Queen really has Returned to her Throne of Pop.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Another Great Album By A Master, A Master i will listen to until the end of time, Go Sufjan :))))) (5 Chins) <br /> <br />Cannot Wait Until Origon
B000B8IA2G|3.0|A store in Regina, Canada released the set early, last Thursday. When we got to Disk 5, we found that the contents were the same as Disk 1, namely, the first four episodes. Naturally, we contacted Sony (who now owns MGM). Their reply was twofold, first, they do not deal with \\"defective\\" disks, their policy is to return it to the store. Second, they stated there were no known issues with this title.  <br /> <br />The second part surely is true, the store released it early! Today, with the official release, I checked 5 other retailers, having them open the box and play Disk 5, telling them what I found. In every case, it was the same, Disk 5 has the same contents as disk 1 and is therefore missing the last 4 episodes.  <br /> <br />Over to you Sony.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The Dance is turned way up; the lame lyrics and \\"religion\\" are kept at a minimum. This album is targeted squarely at Madonna's core audience.... fabulous gentlemen. <br /> <br />If you are a Madonna fan, you will love it. If you're not a fan, then why are you reading this anyway?
B00063MBU8|4.0|I enjoyed their first effort a few years back and I enjoy this one too. <br /> <br />They've grown as a band, as people and in their music. Pierre's voice has a little more gravel in it here and there, there are some guitar solos and the topics of the lyrics are a little more varied. <br /> <br />Yes, they're still \\"clean-cut Canadian lads\\", but WTF is wrong with that? Why can't that be rock'n'roll? That to me is the same as people who state that \\"white folks can't have the blues\\". <br /> <br />These guys have good songwriting skills, boatloads of energy and are getting more proficient playing their instruments. <br /> <br />If a tune like \\"Shut up\\" doesn't get you going in the morning... I don't know what does? <br /> <br />Sorry everyone, but in an age where bands like Train, Keane and Coldplay are considered to be \\"rock music\\"... I reckon Simple Plan absolutely rocks! <br /> <br />And I don't care what you call it. Emo? Punk? Rock? Pop? <br /> <br />Let's just stick to rock. Their songs are catchy, got good guitars, pounding drums. Add to that some attitude and an in-your-face production and you've got a good rock album. <br /> <br />They haven't \\"arrived\\" yet, but I think by album no.4 they'll get it 100% right. <br /> <br />Kudos guys! Hope you stick around for years to come.
B000AL730O|5.0|Is there something McCartney is not good at? im touched, deligthted, happy, nostalgic, charmed, and experiencing all sort of positive feelings with \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" recorded between USA and England and not this time at Abbey Road but at Air studios in London, a collection of amazing songs are gathered here, Fine Line, English Tea, the touching No More Rain, some Beatle atmosphere can be breathe in times, another good one from McCartney!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />HM  <br />
6304119046|5.0|It's a dark vision but an honest one.  A shattered, volatile alcoholic, once almost an opera star and the ex-wife of a deceased magnate, says to a cynical reporter at dawn, \\"Come around and tell me the story of your life sometime.\\"  Moments like that touch a deep core of humanity, and that's why the film endures. <br />
B000AXSN5G|5.0|First the disclaimer:  I'm a Neil Young fan, ever since listening to he and Crazy Horse on an old stereo in my dorm room back in the early `70s--which puts Neil and me in about the same age bracket, I guess.  There are Neil lovers and Neil dislikers (haters seems too strong a word), and I'm a confirmed member of the former group.    A lot has been made that Prairie Wind is the third installment of a trilogy reaching back through Harvest Moon to Harvest.  I can't really contravene the conventional wisdom.  All are transitional at-one-of-life's-crossroads sorts of albums.  In Harvest, Neil was a young man looking at the direction life would take, sorting out alternatives, making choices, feeling that time was `awastin': \\"I wanna live, I wanna give...it's these expressions I never give that keep me searching for a heart of gold. And I'm getting old.\\"    Of course, he wasn't getting old at all. In Harvest Moon, though, he was beginning to show some mid-life age spots.  This is an album of the beginnings of life's cumulative losses-like Old King, a favorite dog, or going through the big divorce, or wistfully wondering what might have been.  But it's also an album of continuation: \\"there's a full moon risin', let's go dancin' in the light.\\"  Harvest Moon wasn't so much a sequel of Harvest as an evocative connection to it.    And now comes Prairie Wind.  Here is an artist who has come to be aware of his own mortality and to be bemused by it.  On one of the great cuts here, \\"This Old Guitar,\\" Young sings of his instrument waiting in its case for Young to play it, \\"or someone else, I suppose.\\" The guitar will outlive him-\\"Ain't mine to keep, just takin' care of it now.\\"  Like many of our best possessions, it will live on, one hopes, in the hands of others.  As in Harvest Moon, Young here muses about the roots of his past and the prospects for his future.  It's been written that Young recorded the album in a brief week before learning of a potentially fatal aneurism that wassuccessfully treated only after the album was completed.  But it sounds more like the work of a reflective man who has that sort of life-altering situation hanging over his head--not one unaware of it.    The last cut, \\"When God Made Me,\\" is a tribute to Young's own breadth of vision and belief in the universality of man and a commentary on the narrow-minded bigotry of our era-and most eras, I suppose.      The only thing I can find negative to say is that the Elvis song, \\"He was the King,\\" seems strangely out of place in this album.  That aside, here is an album that is among the best work Neil Young has ever done.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|And the album being at place 49 of sales (at the date that this review is written) is the evidence. <br /> <br />Also, it's a very cheap move to make a 4th re-release of the same old album with just crappy remixes that sound like the original themes.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|To all those \\"gangsta's\\" who think 50 cent is actually an artist, or even worth a 50 cent purchase, here's a little history lesson - Mr. Charles' was, and still is a GIANT among boys when it comes to music.  Perhaps when you grow some facial hair you will begin to understand this.<br /><br />The voice, the sound, the man.  Ray Charles will live on, while 50 cent and others will be remembered as mere insects splattered on the windshield of sound.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|I haven't liked Madonna's music since the 80's.  When I read reviews in magazines that this cd is suppose to be the return to her 80's dance roots, I bought it.  Mistake.  This sounds nothing like \\"Borderline\\", \\"Burnin' Up\\", \\"Holiday\\" days.  This is techno song after song.  It all sounds the same.  I hate it.
6305428042|5.0|In the 1600s, the Sanderson sisters bewitched people. The three aging women, lusty Sarah, portly Mary, and sinister leader Winifred, were particularly fond of performing a certain spell that would keep them alive and young forever, with repeat use of course. Unfortunately, that particular spell required a living child as the key ingredient! One fateful Halloween night, that unpleasant honor went to adorable little Emily Binx, sister of teenaged Thackery, who immediately ran to his sibling's aid when he heard she'd been lured by Sarah Sanderson to the witches' home in the woods. This was not a well thought out plan though, and the cost was not only the life of his sister Emily, but his own humanity as well. Emily's lifeforce was drained from her body by the three Sanderson witches, and big-brother Thackery Binx was transformed into an immortal black cat, cursed to live forever with the guilt of his failure to save his sister! Luckily for the rest of the children of Salem, the Sanderson sisters were captured that night and hung for their crimes, but not before their living book of spells revealed to them a curse to bring the three back from the dead on All Hallow's Eve when a virgin lights the black flame candle. <br /> <br />300 years later, teenager Max Dennison is a newcomer to Salem, struggling to adjust after growing up in a California lifestyle. It isn't going well for Max. Bullies are stealing his sneakers right off his feet, the girl of his dreams snubs him due to his lack of interest in Halloween, and his little sister, Dani, is ever the pest. Now, he must spend the evening escorting her door to door for trick or treating while their parents enjoy the town Halloween dance. Things are about to go from bad to worse for Max, however. Just when he believes things are looking up after he and Dani convince dream-girl Allison  to take them to the old Sanderson house, Max's efforts to impress the girl lead him to light the black-flame candle himself, bringing Sarah,Mary, and Winifred Sanderson back from the dead! From there on out, it's a non-stop, fun-filled chase as the witches pursue the children, determined to make sassy-mouthed Dani the subject of their next youth spell, which must be performed before dawn or else the witches will be gone forever! With the immortal, talking black cat Binx guiding them along, Max, Dani, and Allison work together to outrun, outwit, and outlast the evil trio and their magical arsenal, with the fate of all the children of Salem hanging in the balance!  <br /> <br />In \\"Hocus Pocus,\\" director Kenny Ortega, who also gave us the equally underrated and enjoyable cult-classic \\"Newsies,\\" brings us a perfect Halloween movie that's actually great fun any time of year! With a fantastic cast headed up by the legendary Bette Midler and \\"Eerie Indiana's\\" Omri Katz, awesome music (Hey, Disney, where's the soundtrack?!), a hilarious script that incorporates all the Halloween essentials, and brilliant special effects, \\"Hocus Pocus\\" easily ranks as one of my favorite films of all-time! Moments such as the bus ride, the encounter with the motorcycle cop, the visit to the Master's house, and, of course, the Sanderson sisters performing \\"I Put a Spell On You\\" at the town party just make this movie fun, fun, fun! The witches may be creepy at times and totally dangerous, but they have a Three Stooges vibe going throughout that keeps things from getting too scary. However, this film CAN be a bit much for younger kids. Yes, despite feeling generally like a typical Disney live-action flick from the `90s (a great time for Disney live-action), there are some surprising moments. The witches do off little Emily in the beginning of the film by stealing her \\"essence,\\" they do use some mild swearing and the virgin joke is unnecessarily hammered into the ground, and, yeah, some folks might find certain aspects scary, but only the very young I'd wager. Basically, this film was targeted at `tweens and teens, and, had they gone to see it, it would probably have been a hit. Unfortunately, it wasn't till repeat airings on the Disney Channel that most people discovered this gem of a holiday film. As for me, I saw it in theaters and am so glad I did! I wish we'd get more Halloween films like this one! This is how I like to see witches on Halloween! Cackling, riding brooms across the sky, and hunting trick or treaters! That's the concept of Halloween witches that scared me as a kid, and that's what I'd like to see more of in Halloween films today! The DVD is sadly bare-bones. Totally disappointing for such a spectacular cult classic! Still, it is without a doubt a must own for annual viewings at the very least!  <br /> <br />For more must watch Halloween viewing, check out \\"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,\\" \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" \\"Ichabod and Mr. Toad,\\" the original \\"The Worst Witch,\\" \\"Garfield Holiday Celebrations,\\" the Casper, Addams Family, and Harry Potter films, \\"Return to Oz,\\" \\"Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Pumpkin Who Couldn't Smile,\\" \\"The Night Dracula Saved the World,\\" \\"The Monster Squad,\\" \\"Ernest Scared Stupid,\\" \\"The Witches,\\" \\"Mad Monster Party,\\" \\"Spaced Invaders,\\"  \\"Love At First Bite,\\" \\"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,\\" and see my Halloween listmania lists for more! Also, for more great `90s Disney live-action films, check out the Mighty Ducks film series, \\"The Adventures of Huck Finn,\\" \\"Dick Tracy,\\" \\"Cool Runnings,\\" \\"Newsies,\\" \\"Tom and Huck,\\" the \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\" films, \\"101 Dalmatians,\\" \\"Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book,\\" \\"The Santa Clause,\\" \\"Tom and Huck,\\" \\"White Fang,\\" \\"Heavyweights,\\" \\"The Rocketeer,\\" \\"Three Musketeers,\\" \\"Iron Will,\\" and more! But don't forget about classic Disney live-action either, or their great `80's stuff, like my number one favorite film, \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit!\\" With great new stuff like \\"Herbie: Fully Loaded,\\" \\"Holes,\\"  \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" and the upcoming \\"Chronicles of Narnia,\\" it seems that Disney live-action is still going strong! <br />
B000B8QEZG|2.0|In the old days, Madonna hung out with drag queens, supermodels and eunichs, disco dancing and being really bitchy. And hugely interesting.<br /><br />These days, she hangs out with psuedo Rabbis and people that moan about fox hunting being made illegal while she thinks up ideas for her next children's book.<br /><br />Is it really a surprise then that her new record sounds so contrived and behind the times? She's just not in the mix with hip, creative people anymore. This album sounds like recycled Benjamin Diamond from 1999, with a splash of Scissor Sisters. There are not any immediately obvious hit songs, like the Madonna albums of old. There is plenty of Madonna speaking during songs with her perspectives on love and life. The whole time she babbles you're thinking, please SHUT UP! and you find yourself reaching for one of her old records. The single with the Abba sample is just pathetic, she should be above such gimmickry.<br /><br />The lyrics are laughable. There's an OK song about New York City, but the lyric is something to the effect of:<br /><br />\\"The only city I love is New York...Other cities just make me feel like a dork...\\"<br /><br />Think of all the poor poets throughout time who killed themselves in poverty, and the cosmic injustice that Madonna is allowed to write crap like this.<br /><br />It's really a shame that this record is not the return to form that everyone was hoping for. Unfortunately, it seems that Madonna needs to fall really far before she makes another great record.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is hands down the best album of the year. Pure and easy groove for a full hour with NO bad tracks! <br />This future disco sound wraps around you in a warm and shimmery groove - making you feel like you're right there on the dance floor.  <br />Truly great.
0553801503|5.0|\\"A feast for Crows\\" provides the same level of quality as the previous three volumes in the series.  That's all that really needs to be said.  Those who enjoyed the first three books ought to obtain a copy of this one was well, and enjoy it. <br /> <br />Stylistically, Martin stays very much in line with what he's already written.  There are a few chapters at the beginning, most notable featuring Brienne (who is now a point-of-view character) that fill up space without very mmuch happening.  However the events in King's Landing are still coming in fast and furious.  Despite the massive number of competing houses and brotherhoods, etc... already on the scene, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" sees a number of new players on the stage.  In King's Landing a new High Septon is chosen, as he's not too interested in having the Faith continue in a role subservient to the crown.  The Iron Bank of Braavos is starting to get itchy about its money.  And the very final chapter features a real doozy of a plot twist.  Martin does not shy away from introducing new characters.  Whole crowds appear in the Iron Islands, Dorne, the Vale and elsewhere, though as yet few of them are more than bit players. <br /> <br />In terms of character the same high standards seen earlier in the series are maintained.  Fans may particularly relish the role played by Cercei (also a point-of-view character), who becomes if anything more hatable once we get the view from inside her head.  In some sense Cercei's abject stupidity may be a turn off for some, but the general sweep of the King's Landing intrigues remains as overpowering as in the previous volumes.  Jaime continues to mature.  Samwell starts to come into his own, which is good as I was beginning to tire of him in the earlier chapters.  Arya and Sansa are little seen, but their chapters are very well-written. <br /> <br />Overall \\"Feast\\" is a lull in terms of the amount of pure action.  Unquestionably many chapters exist only to set up events later in theseries.  However it is perfectly readable as a novel in its own right, and the biggest conflict is, in fact, resolved at the end.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Well, ONE of the things about Madonna is that from DAY ONE, she hasn't cared much about what anyone thinks of her. Like a true artist she follows her own path and if it happens to please you, fine. Play along, dance, buy the music, whatever...    Which explains American Life. She was doing what SHE wanted to do; we were left to follow or to not follow. Clearly many did not follow. Which is OK since American Life is simply not that accessible. BUT if it were the debut album from some angst-ridden starlet, it would have been called GENUIS. So be it. But due to the awesome fame Madonna has created, every single move she makes is analyzed and weighed down so heavily, usually by the people that declare her irrelevant! LOL! And so American Life got swamped in over-analysis...    I've always said Madonna could write an entire album of number one hits if she only CHOSE to, her mastery of pop songwriting is that strong. Truth be told, she is THE MASTER of American pop song craft. Time will prove this out. Time is steadily proving this out...    And so here it is at last: Madonna's perfect pop album (her prior most-nearly-perfect pop album being her absolutely sublime debut.) 'Hung Up' is fun but really a publicity stunt, a throwaway, and is even pretty much segregated from the rest of the album. Confessions On A Dance Floor really seems to kick off with Track Two, the completely flawless 'Get Together' It feels like the perfect pop culmination of her career to date. Get ready, world, this track is going to be unstoppable, it is going to be MASSIVE. It is Madonna's new 'Holiday' and a trippy piece of pop perfection. Like the entire CD, really...    To give this album one-star ratings and call her washed-up, a has been, etc, is to refuse to see the obvious intellect behind all of her music. Her field is POP and within that field she is VERY, VERY SMART. What an ear. Truly. (Uh, how many perfect pop hooks did she fit into 'Beautiful Stranger'? About fourteen?)    And let's notforget that ENTIRE CAREERS are being made from slagging her off and from declaring her 'over'. Seriously. Families are being fed by 'journalists' regularly hurling stones up at Madonna on her pedestal. (She was declared 'over' in 2003 when, only a few years earlier, 'Music' had streaked to the top of the singles chart in only four weeks; I'd like to be 'over' like that...)    And I feel sorry for the other so-called divas of the day who work with the same producer on EVERY SINGLE ALBUM. Surely they will lay on their deathbeds and think 'Why didn't I take more chances?' To release the same CD over and over is so BORING and clearly not the mark of a true artist's mind. I welcome Madonna's tangents and chance-taking including, yes, the experimental American Life...    If you do not sense the curiosity and intelligence in this woman, if you cannot hear the curiosity and the intelligence in her music, you probably don't have much yourself. But in their hearts, I am certain the detractors sense the truth. Which is: There is MADONNA. And then there is ALL THE REST. She's in a class of her own and has been from day one...    And the best kept secret might be how truly expressive her voice is. In fact, she has one of the most definitive and unique voices in American pop music history. (Who cares about the technical proficiency of a Streisand? When's the last time you sped to get home to listen to 'Evergreen'?) As a club DJ for nearly 20 years, I can tell you that her voice has the power to completely change the energy of a room. That is TALENT. No one reading this review will accomplish such a thing in TWO lifetimes. Just try it. Train the listening public to have a VISCERAL and IMMEDIATE reaction to the SOUND of your VOICE. We'll wait...    This is THE album of the year 2005, an amazing crash course in musical history and a vision of the future of music. Hats off to Madonna and Stuart Price. I refuse to burn Confessions On A Dance Floor for anyone. Such a project, such joyful and beautiful creativity, should be supported by the lovers of art in this world...    Madonna, you are the one and only. What you have made of your life is truly remarkable and I wish your mother could have shared it with you... xoxox
B0000C8AVR|5.0|There was never anything like it when it came out and there never will be anything like it again.  I believe Dylan decided to try and pen a hit for the first time with \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" after seeing the success The Byrds were having with his songs.  This is a timeless collection of songs that Dylan put down with Al Kooper and Michael Bloomfield.  If you buy one CD by Bob Dylan, this is THE ONE CD you must own - period.  Actually, if you are only ever going to own one CD, this is the one CD to buy.  I'm not going into details or heaping more accolades on this work. Just click now, it's worth every cent and more!
0679745653|5.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's, a book by Truman Capote, is a short novel that is very well-written. The book consists of four short stories, and although the plot of the four stories have nothing in common with one another, they are tied together by a central theme. Capote also demonstrates superb use of symbolism throughout his book.<br /><br />The main idea of each short story revolves around the loss of someone or something loved. The first story, \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" is about two close friends, but after a series of dramatic events are forced to leave each other forever. \\"House of Flowers\\" tells of Ottilie, a girl who chooses to leave her rich, easy life and marries to a poor boy who works in the fields. In \\"A Diamond Guitar,\\" one friend betrays the other, leaving Mr. Schaeffer watching \\"the face of his friend, suspended above him...it was so distant, judging.\\" And finally, \\"A Christmas Memory,\\" is perhaps the saddest of all four stories. Here, two lifelong friends who have spent every Christmas together, eventually grow apart due to a sudden change in lifestyles. Capote says that loss is something all must endure, and the only way to deal with a loss is to grow from it.<br /><br />The author relies on symbolism to bring more life to his stories, and no doubt he uses this element well. For example, the Houngan in \\"House of Flowers\\" explains to Ottilie that if she catches a wild bee and it \\"does not sting, then [she] will know [she has] found love.\\" The bee represents Ottilie's heart, something wild and free. Yet if she allows herself to be tamed, then she will find true love. It is instances like this that make Capote's stories timeless.<br /><br />Capote engages the reader's attention in each story. His language is simple, and the reader never becomes bored with what he has to tell. But perhaps what brings his book together is the message he communicates: loss of love is unavoidable, and by overcoming it comes learning and knowledge that love will come again.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Bad already released Music, people, this is not RnB, MC is the sweet girl next door who now pretends to have street cred and makes cheap songs by featuring like 200 different artists and never standing by herself, it must be that after her mental breakdown she simply lost her voice and now resorts to lypsynching.
0679422714|1.0|There are 2 types of books about China that sell very well in the West. <br />The first type is to the business market, about the 1 billion consumers, about how to conduct business, about how to read the Chinese mind, about the rise of China etc etc. <br />The other one is to paint an extreme pessimist picture of China, and this entertains well to the intellectuals, whether liberal, conservative, neoconservatice etc etc.  The book THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA (published 5-6 years ago) is still in every newsstand (I kept wondering what time frame the author had in mind for the coming collapse: 2 years, 5 years, 1 decade, 1 century???).  The latest one is MAO: THE UNKNOWN STORY by June Chung, apparently to paint Mao as 1000% evil and the book is apparently another bestseller. <br />This book will be good reading for people who already have made up their mind about the evil Mao.  There is nothing to learn from this book; it just entertains those who already made up their mind by the western propaganda. <br />But if you really want to learn more about China, then steer clear of those 2 types of books. Go and read its history, its feudal pasts, its humiliation by foreign powers and how it shaped the Chinese mentality, how the country broke apart and governed by warloards, and how the people suffered, learn how Chian Kai Shiek persecute the communists and giving rise to Mao, learn why despite the disasters of Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution that Mao is still respected or despised.   <br />Mao is neither saint nor evil; he is just another politician trying to change China from its feudal past and raise up from the humiliation it suffered from the foreign powers. He made some positive accomplishments and some negative disasters.    <br />The author failed to give a balance picture, failed to explain the Chinese mindset but if she did that, then the book will not be a bestseller in the West.
B000AMPZGC|5.0|Danny Elfman and Tim Burton have done it again! This CD is excellent. Its creepy in parts and funny in others and it just works so well with the movie. Now, there are people out there who just wanted this to be The Nightmare Before Christmas part 2 and it isnt so they're mad and gave it bad reviews, but dont listen to them. This is a wonderful soundtrack and you really should buy it. You wont be sorry.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Remember when Mariah was getting slammed in the press for her lead off singles all being just remakes of each other? It started with Fantasy, which sampled another song, then Honey/Heartbreaker/Loverboy.  It seemed like no matter what, Mariah was just rehashing/reworking the same hooks to deliver the same music.  Well, this re-release is no different.  \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is just a combination of \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Shake It off.\\"  And then there are 2 parts of \\"So Lonely,\\" as if one part wasn't enough to make you rip your ears off.  Then there is a remix of \\"We Belong Together.\\"  Mariah is the worst when it comes to remixes and I don't even know how she can call this a remix when all she did was add some rappers to it.  If thats what she calls a remix, then half the cd is a remix album because she has rappers on every other song.  And please, the girl needs to go back to her \\"roots\\" and start singing by herself again, leave the rappers to JLO (who does it a lot better)  The only song i haven't heard is \\"makin it last all night\\" but with ZZZZZZZZZZZ worthy flops like Mine Again, Stay the night, circles, i wish you knew, joyride, fly like a bird, etc. is there really a need for it?  Unless you're having trouble sleeping, I say no!
B000BGH22W|5.0|I'm a huge John Williams fan and was disapointed and concerned when I heard that he wouldnt be scoring this movie. I had no plans on buying the soundtrack but AOL's music site is currently letting people hear the entire soundtrack for free so I figured since it wasnt going to cost me anything i'd give it a shot. I was pleasently suprised to find out that this is a very good soundtrack. I have now gone out and bought it on CD and cant wait to see the movie. So in short, just because John Williams didnt do it doesnt mean it cant be good. Give it a chance and listen to it more then once before you make your final call. P.S.-the \\"rock\\" tracks at the very end arent very good but thats the beauty of CD's, I can program my player to skip these and start it back from the begining.

This is an amazingly fun and energetic album......every song is unique, uplifting, and just makes you wanna get up and move....  Awesome music for getting ready for a night on the town....
B000BO0LLS|1.0|The producing is bad, the only difference with the original is a new cover. The supposedly new songs are in reality remixes of the old ones, I feel robbed.
B000002BYD|4.0|i was greatful to see PJ back in the day when they were huge.that particular got on the news because of security reasons,too many people.i loved their first album,Ten,which is a classic rock album,loved VS. and Vitalogy.but something happened along the way and i'm really not sure what it was,but i just stopped listening.than recently i picked this up and was over all pleased with it's production.it's not as good as the three albums i mentioned but is still worthwhile.here they continue their experimental ways and Vedder continues his Morrison-inspired lyrics.but i couldn't help thinking that it's Vedder who doesn't match the bands musical talents.a couple of songs i thought would have been better kept as instrumentals.but those songs aren't bad ,nor or any songs here.it's just that it's not perfect nor as memorable as previous outings.if you are a fan of PJ than you should like this.if not than you might like it for the song \\"Given to Fly.\\" overall still, a good production.
0743201140|5.0|Reading and following Marcus Buckingham's direction after reading the first 4 chapters brings new meaning to the phrase, \\"truth hurts\\". Once I completed the first 4 chapters, then took the Strength Finder test, I was amazed at the accuracy! Spouses should each read this. Students should read this. Employment recruiters and HR managers should read this. Unemployment counselors should read this. If the solution to life's fulfilment can be described thru a mathematical equation, then this is [easily] one of the varibles. I dare you to read this and take the test!

B000B8QEZG|4.0|WELL LET ME START OFF BY FIRST SAYING I ABSOLUTELY LOVED AMERICAN LIFE FROM START TO FINISH. IT IS MY ALL TIME FAV MADONNA DISC. IT WAS A VERTY SIMPLE YET DEEP, THINKING MANS ALBUM. NO OVER THE TOP PRODUCTION JUST GOOD LYRICS AND VOCALS. OK NOW COAD ITS A VERY GOOD CD HER BEST \\"DANCE\\" CD SINCE EROTICA WHICH IS MY 2ND FAV MADDY CD. I THINK SHE WANTED SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE LIGHT AND HAPPY THIS GO AROUND BECAUSE SHE DID THE SAME THING AFTER RAY OF LIGHT WITH MUSIC. SOME OF THESE BAD REVIEWS I REALLY HAVE TO WONDER ABOUT..DID THEY REALLY LISTEN TO THE CD? IT WASNT MEANT TO BE REALLY SERIOUS JUST FUN. SO WHAT IF SHE USED THE WORD \\"DORK\\" IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS PEOPLE. IT IS A VERY EUROPEAN SOUNDING CD AND THE SINGLES PROBABLY WONT GET A TON OF RADIO PLAY IN THE US BUT AS A WHOLE I THINK THE ALBUM WILL SELL TONS. PEOPLE KEEP TRYING TO COUNT HER OUT BUT IF U THINK ABOUT IT WHO IS STILL LEFT MAKING GOOD MUSIC ABND SELLING RECORDS FROM THE 80'S NO ONE. SHE IS THE ONLY ARTIST WHO HAS REALLY STOOD THE TEST OF TIME. MY FAV SINGLE ON COAD HAS GOT TO BE \\"GET TOGETHER\\" ITS VERY SMOOVE N SEXY, \\"HUNG UP\\" IS JUST TOO CATCHY FOR WORDS AND SO IS \\"SORRY\\". \\"ISAAC\\" IS VERY GOOD SO ARE PUSH AND JUMP.

0553801503|3.0|He kept his word that the story would be all the plot for half the characters and so try to accomplish something The bad news is that most of the characters that are the main characters are lacking in this (most of the surviving Starks, Tyrion, a few others) and some only get cameos(two of the other Starks.) Then to add a bit of confusion, two of the main characters have chapters under their secret names(the last two Starks.) <br />However, as far as characters we love to hate, the Cleganes and most especially Cersei, they, to not give any spoilers, have each have a bit of humility prescribed to them. The family that we all know and loathe, the Freys, does not have enough come-uppance come to it, in mine opinion, but the story is young yet. <br />The cold-blooded ruthlessness of Jaime, Cersei, Tywin and Joffrey seem to have originally set the Lannisters as subhuman racist supermen, but this is moderated by Tommen, Kevan Lannister(Tywin's brother) and surprisingly, (or perhaps not to those who remember A Storm of Swords) Jaime. The humility instilled in him by Vargo Hoat and his Companions has positively affected his character in mine opinion. <br />The only real drawback is that the brutality of the world is starting to become too much. Everyone seems to think with the sword on their belts, except those who are subtle enough to think with the dagger up their sleeves. Everyone is being raped except for those who are being gelded. At first I thought the title was inappropriate, because for the most part the Night's Watch has little to do with the story, but it is very appropriate considering that crows are, after all, carrion eaters. No matter what, the crows of Westeros are definitely entering a happy time, and the vultures, magpies, etc. <br />He did not want to only tell what he told, but hopefully now A Dance With Dragons will be completed much more quickly. I only hope it will have more overlap and both the main two plot lines I am interested in, Bran and Daenrys-and more Brienne. The Brienne/Jaime subplots are something that helped me through this entertainingly brutal world

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I am also very happy this is coming out on dvd with all of the extras. I was fortunate to have been on the front row of their Pulse concert in Raleigh. What is totally amazing to me is Astronomy Domine being left out of this dvd. Didnt they film all of their concerts? Wasnt a clip of Astronomy shown on the Mtv Documentary? Surely they have this in their own archives. They opened their shows with it on that tour with a brilliant light show to start off that concert. Then they had to change their show to play all of Dark Side and of all the songs to cut out of the show, they had to cut Astronomy Domine and begin with Shine On which also opened up Delicate Sound Of Thunder. Come on guys, you still have 2 months before it is released here in the U.S. Work on putting an additional 5 minutes on this dvd and give us a version of Astronomy Domine which will blow our minds to sweeten up all of the other extras that will be included. <br />Joey Hornick <br />
B0009ML238|3.0|This band plays well, but their sound is both dated and derivative.  If this album had come out in the early '90's, it would've sounded like a lesser Dream Theater, and that is in fact what it is.  Yes, there are catchy moments here, and virtuousic playing.  It's an enjoyable album to listen to for the most part, but it contributes very little to progressive metal as a genre.  Moreover, there are bad moments on this album, as well, e.g. the horrific keyboard orchestration on \\"The First Chapter.\\" Don't get me wrong, I love keyboards as much as anyone, but there are places keyboards should go, and places they shouldn't.  And unfortunately, Circus Maximus go to those no-no places a bit too often.  I had high hopes for this album, but have been disappointed overall.  If you own Images and Words, you really have no need for this album.
B00006EXCC|4.0|\\"Aftermath\\" started a brief departure for the Stones from blues-influenced pop songs and began a new period where their songwriting and arrangements would become better. In 1968, they returned to the blues, but they wouldn't lose the qualities they gained from this time. <br /> <br />I prefer the UK version to the condensed US version, mainly because minor classics like \\"Out of Time\\" and \\"What to Do\\" are on here. It also has some of their softest (and at the same time, their most sinister) songs like \\"Lady Jane,\\" \\"I Am Waiting,\\" and \\"Under My Thumb.\\" Unfortunately, we do get \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" instead of \\"Paint It, Black.\\" You can't get everything, I suppose!  <br /> <br />I love this album, but the main reason I give it four stars is the song \\"Goin' Home.\\" This could have been a pretty decent three-minute song, but the Stones decide to stretch it to over eleven. In this way, \\"Goin' Home\\" could be seen as the template for later songs like the Velvet Underground's \\"Sister Ray,\\" but it's still the wrong kind of song to do this with.  <br /> <br />I'm glad Abkco is finally starting to reissue the UK versions of their earliest albums. It's really important becuase this is the version the Stones and Andrew Oldham wanted the album to sound, it wasn't up to the management decisions of seven people in the US. Here's to hoping Abkco releases their debut album and \\"No. 2\\"!
B000AY74OQ|3.0|It seems many people had high hopes for this film, and left the theatre deeply dissappointed. I felt similarly, but the film wasn't terrible, it was just uninspired.<br /><br />Since parents will have to watch this film anyway, I would say to them that there IS some good material here. The penguins steal the show, and their antics take up a good bit of the film, breaking up the boring bits with the principle characters. The Lemurs, especially King Julian, are also pretty funny.<br /><br />The DVD comes with all of the extras that families have come to expect from Dreamworks on their animated DVDs. A number of games are available on the disc, but the best game is the one hidden behind the Penguin \\"Code\\" puzzle.<br /><br />The disc has secret clues which, when entered into a special screen, unlock the best game on the disc! This game is a sort of puzzle maze where kids can guide the Penguins around a giant ship until they get to the control room and take over. The code you need to play this game is pretty simple to guess at, even if you don't search every menu for the codes. There's even a hint button on the code screen.<br /><br />Go on, try it. You are going to have to sit through this film if you have children anyway. You might as well see if your children enjoy the extra content as much as mine did.

B0009HLDFU|1.0|As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows, and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses.<br /><br />This CD has the same copyright protection, called XCP. When installed, Sony hijacks your computer and installs custom software which:<br /><br />1) Hides itself entirely from Windows by installing as a rootkit<br /><br />2) Hides itself in such a manner that any files begining with $sys$ are also hidden. For example, if you install the XCP copy protection software on your machine, and rename \\"document.doc\\" to \\"$sys$document.doc\\" it then becomes invivisble to you forever.<br /><br />3) Installs its own custom CD-Rom drivers to hijack your system. It also sneakily names these drivers \\"Plug and Play Device Manager\\" to seem as if it's a part of Windows. Trying to delete these drivers manually will disable your CD-Rom drive entirely.<br /><br />4) Offers no uninstall option until you manually contact Sony<br /><br />As of my writing this review, Sony has \\"apologized\\" for this incident, and claims they will \\"re-evaluate\\" this copyright protection software on their CDs in the future.<br /><br />In the meantime, a virus is currently running wild, which names itself begining with $sys$ in an attempt to hide from the user and virus scanners.<br /><br />Several class action lawsuits are also pending against Sony right now.<br /><br />In summary, as you can tell from above, Sony's actions here are absolutely horrible. This is your music. You purchased it, and they should not have any right to dictate how you can use it, let alone install software which compromises your system security.<br /><br />This is one of the CDs with Sony's XCP copyright protection software on it, and as a result, you should not buy it to send a message to Sony that this will NOT be tolerated in the future.Ds with Sony's XCP copyright protection software on it, and as a result, you should not buy it to send a message to Sony that this will NOT be tolerated in the future.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah Carey, the best selling female artist of all time is back and bigger than ever!!! I purchased this album in April (The original release date) and now I bought this re-release and its so good. This album is one of Mariah's best work in years, the album is amazing from the start, love all songs and now with this re-release we can get the new smash hit \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" and some incredible extra tracks as well. This edition contains a DVD with videos and an incredible interview. If you are a fan of great music, amazing vocals and want the hottest album now, you should get The Emancipation of Mimi, its worth it. The best album of the year!!!.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Aside from the really bad hair \\"don't\\" that Madonut seems to be sporting these days (please lay off the curling iron Mo, I beg you) -- Madonna is at the top of her game, at least musically.  It goes to show how clever she is at tapping the right producer (Stuart Price) to keep her music current and fresh, even when it leans on the use of an ABBA sample from \\"Gimme Gimme.\\"  There's not a stinker in the bunch, and all the tracks are solid and stand on their own.  The CD is cohesive and flows well, and is a must have for Madonna fans who appreciate Madonna when she's just out to make good danceable tracks that carry no spiritual or political message, but just beg you to \\"get into the groove\\" and \\"dance with [your] baby.\\"
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Years after the deception \\"American Life\\" brought to REAL Madonna Fans, Madonna redeems herself with this new album.  All Dance, no slow music here.  From the splendid opening track to the album's closer, \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" is sure to put people to dance all over the world.  Lyric-wise, songs are quite good, with a few dumb lines here and there like, for example, \\"other cities make me feel like a dork\\" in the ode to NYC \\"I Love New York\\".<br /><br />\\"Hung up\\" is the best track so far, I like the ABBA sampling they do at the beginning of the song. Her ode to New York is nothing extraordinary but it sticks on you.  \\"Jump\\" is a good-feel song, to lift your mood anytime of the day, I usually listen to it in the mornings.  I found \\"Isaac\\" a very amusing song, with the eastern flavor thrown in.<br /><br />Madonna has put an album so good it makes you wonder how you'd ever settle for these so-called pop princesses.<br /><br />This is the music Madonna was meant to make, finally an album to achieve what Ray of Light did: a powerful comeback.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver(1966). The Beatles Eighth Album.<br /><br />HISTORY<br /><br />In 1966, The Beatles were on top of the world. The Beatles were coming fresh off the success of Yellow Submarine, a blockbuster animated movie that found The Beatles fighting the blue meanies with their music. When Revolver was released, it practically flew off the shelves. \\"Taxman\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" were some of The Beatles finest hits, and Revolver has become a fan favorite for The Beatles.<br /><br />MUSIC<br /><br />By 1966, The Beatles had grown out of doing cover songs and traditional pop tunes. The Beatles were now frequently experimenting with Indian and Psychadelic sounds, something that would be very central in the creation of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and The White Album. George Harrison played a major role in Revolver, creating \\"Taxman\\", \\"I Want To Tell You\\", and \\"Love You To\\", some of his finest songs along with \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord\\". Ringo Starr even helped make \\"Yellow Submarine\\", the classic trippy childhood whimsy. Lennon and McCartney had greatly developed since the days of \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", and it shows. \\"Doctor Roberts\\", \\"She Said She Said\\", and \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" were all hazy drug tunes, and \\"Tommorrow Never Knows\\" found John reading pages from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The Beatles had clearly developed as songwriters, but also as musicians.<br /><br />Taxman - George Harrison's sarcastic and scathing look at England's corrupt tax system, \\"Taxman\\" is a punchy, bouncing rocker just brimming with attitude. George turns up the amp and lets loose, and he really sings his heart out. Truly one of The Beatles' finest tracks, and a perfect way to start an album.<br /><br />Eleanor Rigby - A dark, depressing ballad, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" finds The Beatles discussing death and loneliness in a truly heartfelt way. Helped along by a weeping cello, Paul McCartney gives a brilliant and emotional vocal performance. Truly heartfelt.<br /><br />I'm Only Sleeping - The trippy, psychadelic \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is a drug influenced tune from The Beatles. A fantastic effort, The Beatles make the song sound tired and dreamy, and \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is a fine example of music imitating life.<br /><br />Love You To - George Harrison's influential Indian pop song, \\"Love You To\\" finds Harrison singing over a frantic sitar melody. Very psychadelic and experimental, nonetheless \\"Love You To\\" is another fine track.<br /><br />Here, There, and Everywhere - A dreamy pop ballad, \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" is a slow, smooth pop tune like \\"Michelle\\" or \\"Girl\\". Not quite as good as the rest of the album, but a fine song by itself.<br /><br />Yellow Submarine - Ringo Starr's trippy children's pop tune, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" remains a classic children's song even today. A fun blend of over-the-top sound effects and sing-along lyrics, it's still a great song today.<br /><br />She Said She Said - John Lennon's psychadelic rocker, \\"She Said She Said\\" is a hazy, funky Lennon classic. The Beatles show why they are the most important rock band, because they set the bar for everyone that followed. \\"She Said She Said\\" is an catchy yet serious rock song, and a great song.<br /><br />Good Day Sunshine - Paul McCartney's happy \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is a piano ballad sung about the sun. Fun and catchy, \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is a great light rocker.<br /><br />And Your Bird Can Sing - A classic and underrated Lennon masterpiece, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" is a maze of multi-tracked guitars, chugging bass, and John Lennon's upbeat singing. A nice uplifting tune from John Lennon, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" is an unfairly underrated and fabulous song by The Beatles.<br /><br />For No One - A despairing pop tune, \\"For No One\\" finds Paul McCartney trying to find pity for his sorrows in a track not unlike \\"In My Life\\". Paul McCartney is reknowned for his ability to write fantastic pop tunes, and here he creates yet another fantastic pop ballad.<br /><br />Doctor Robert- John Lennon's drug-influenced rocker, \\"Doctor Robert\\" is a trippy and fun look at John Lennon's notorious drug dealer. Very personal and revealing, \\"Doctor Robert\\" is still a fun and very cool song from The Beatles.<br /><br />I Want To Tell You - Harrison's psychadelic piano ballad, \\"I Want To Tell You\\" is a mix of out-of-key piano and guitars. It might sound bad, but trust me, it works like a charm. George Harrison crafts yet another excellent pop tune.<br /><br />Got To Get You Into My Life - A catchy tune, \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" has a somewhat funky soul arrangement. Paul McCartney sings with pure attitude, and the song is as hard rocking and soulful as anything The Beatles ever did.<br /><br />Tommorrow Never Knows - Revolver's strangest track, \\"Tommorrow Never Knows\\" is a blend of strange noises, droning drums, phased-out guitars, and John Lennon's drugged-out chanting. Very noisy and colorful, \\"Tommorrow Never Knows\\" is a great end to Revolver.<br /><br />OPINION<br /><br />Revolver, along with Rubber Soul, truly is the peak of The Beatles music. The colorful experimentation and songwriting showed how The Beatles had grown as musicians and lyricists, and Revolver showed them at their creative and musical apex. Each track on here is a Beatles' classic! I couldn't pick favorites, as I'd probably name every song. If you are interested in The Beatles, I wholeheartedly recommend Revolver or Rubber Soul to get your collection started. Truly a genre-defining album, and a classic no rock fan should be caught dead without.<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!stic pop tunes, and here he creates yet another fantastic pop ballad. <br /> <br />Doctor Robert- John Lennon's drug-influenced rocker, \\"Doctor Robert\\" is a trippy and fun look at John Lennon's notorious drug dealer.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's amazing to see the obviously few negative reviews here.  I guarantee they didn't even buy the album and are just bashing madonna for their own reasons.  If you were actually interested enough in Madonna to buy the album, do you really think you'd bash it the way the negative reviews are doing so?  Not a chance. <br /> <br />If you like Madonna and love the electronic/dance direction she's gone since 'Ray of Light', you will enjoy this album immensely.  It is of course different, as all her albums are, but that is the beauty of madonna.  This one has fused clubby dance styles with her signature pop.  The result is a beautifully catchy pop dance record.  It's really that simple.  I'm glad to see her bringing true dance type stuff into the US pop market.  The current US market is desperately in need of something different so this album is definitely a step in the right direction. <br /> <br />If you like madonna, there is now way you will not like this album.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna is back after 2 years with her new album Confessions Of A Broken Heart. I bought it today and, if you like to dance, you'll like this album. It's really techno with a lot of computer sounds. There's a couple of soungs I don't like but I definitly enjoy listening to it. It makes me wanna dance, and music like that makes you happy when your down so. Welcome back Madonna ! And to everybody, get your copy the fast you can ! It worth it !
B000BO0LLS|5.0|IF YOU NOTICE, MOST OF THE BAD REVIEWS ON THIS ALBUM IS FROM THE SAAAAAAAAAME PERSON! Check their other album reviews... there are NONE!!! and each and every single one of them references Jennifer Lopez (untalented and tasteless)! it surprises me how much time this person has to create multiple accounts just to bash mariah! i really, honestly don't get it.  mariah is amazing. sure i disagree with her new release but that doesn't make her less talented.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I've been a fan of Madonna's music from day one, largely in part because her music has always transcended just being entertainment. Until now. This is the first album that seemingly relies on a past-proven formula of success, rather than to blaze a new and interesting trail. As such, it is a good dance music album, however, one that could have been released by a number of good dance music artists. Can it be that Madonna has become just another face in the music crowd?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It really has everything for a excellent film.  A cast in which you care about everyone in the movie, the action, comedy, most important the story which are all spot on.<br /><br />I Wish the series would come back though, it would be very nice.<br /><br />But what the hell is with the cover? That is pure rubbish!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This this the ultimate Led Zeppelin DVD. All of Led Zeppelin's greatest songs and performences are on this DVD. If you are a zeppelin fan, buy this DVD. You will not be dissapointed with Jimmy Page's solos, Bonzos Moby Dick, and rare footage from backstage and interviews.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars to this CD is because I don't like all the songs on it ('I Love New York' being an example). However,'Hung Up','Sorry','Future Lovers',and   'Forbidden Love' are masterpieces. 'Future Lovers' has this haunting futuristic electronic beat that reminds me of Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer's disco classic,'I Feel Love'. Overall,  this is a very good CD and I don't regret buying it.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Sony has assured Backstreets Magazine that this CD and all Springsteen CDs are free of Sony's discredited XPC copy protection scheme (heck even the Bush administration's Dept of Homeland Security has condemned it -- they know a safe popular issue when they see one). So it's safe to play this CD on your computer. That said... if you like Springsteen, you're going to love this CD and the DVDs. If you hate Springsteen, there's nothing here to change your mind. And if you are neutral or just plain unfamiliar with his music, you are in for a real treat. Intelligent, tuneful, rockin' -- you can't ask for much more than that.
B00004Z459|2.0|I'm giving 2 stars instead of one because these guys are slightly more talented artists, musically, than Limp Bizkit. But it's the same musical hollowness, not much talent. Their purpose seems to be not to make music, as much as to make money off of teenagers with disposable income. And the bands aren't totally to blame; it's also the greedy record execs or whoever $ign$ them to the label, knowing full well they stand to make TONS of money. If you like these teen-leech bands I'd venture to guess you are very young (0-16 yrs) and are ignorant musically. I was once the same way. Bands like this leech off of this ignorance.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I run a digital arts studio and teach digital arts, and have tried more than a dozen different headphones in the $15 to $250 price range. Again and again, I go back to using the MDR-7506 for all applications from digital video shooting and editing to music recording and studio mastering. Most of the pros I know also use the MDR-7506 when they have a choice--and buy them for use at home too.<br /><br />What makes these the best? First and foremost, excellent reproduction from bass into the high end, with unrivalled \\"punch\\" and clarity. They are much louder at a given input volume than most headphones, which is important if your are recording in the field and need to hear the headphone monitoring above the ambient sound and the live sound around you. They are comfortable, instantly adjust to different head sizes without any fussing, sturdy and easily repairable, and stowe quickly and easily in the included soft drawstring bag.<br /><br />I do keep a couple of pairs of high-end ($300+) headphones to check as references when mastering music, but honestly I seldom find anything with them that isn't already clear with the 7506es.<br /><br />The only problem I can report is that, even though they invariably outlast other headphones in terms of wear-and-tear, they do get STOLEN more often by my students. Once you get used to the 7506, its hard to go back to using any other headphones that cost less that twice their price.<br /><br />I still dream of someday discovering a comparable headphone set for half or a quarter the price of the MDR7506. Every year, I buy a few $25 or $50 models just out of hope. So far, however, nothing out there qualifies as \\"acceptable\\" to me--including the many competing $99 headphone models from other companies and even from Sony.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't hesitate. You absolutely cannot go wrong with the MDR7506. This is the headphone of choice, the industry standard. The only reason they're so cheap is MARKET VOLUME--Sony sells a lot of these to audio and video pros!!e to audio and video pros!!
B000002GQG|5.0|This is my favorite album of any genre and time. I agree with the reviewer that said it's a spiritual experience. I also am careful about how much i listen to it! I can't express with words what exactly is so GODLY about this album. It must be experienced, all the way through. In my opinion THIS IS ONE OF MANKIND'S HIGHEST ACHIEVMENTS!
B0000025RI|5.0|in the history of music. If you are thinking of buying this album, you already heard it and the reviews tell everything you need to know about the music and the artist. All I have to say is this. If you are thinking of buying an album 20 years after it's release, with music that still speaks to your soul....Thriller, #1 album of all time....Enough said!
B000001Y42|1.0|The 'Poser-Band-with-the-least-musical-talent-to-sell-the most-records-to-musically-ignorant-Mtv-teenagers-award' goes to... *drum roll* *fart!* Limp Bizkit! <br /> <br />Now, I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but c'mon. Let me tell you, I listen to just about every genre of music out there, and recognizing the level of talent behind any music is easy; I may not like a song or a band, but can tell if the artist has any talent. I don't think Fred Durst can even call himself an artist. The only thing these guys are good at is putting forth an image.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|All of those Madonna naysayers will be clamping their mouths shut after they hear this disc - more than 50 minutes of disco-pop ecstasy.   <br /> <br />Fans couldn't have asked for much more out of this disc - and the general public is sure to agree once they hear the can't-get-them-out-of-your-head hooks. <br /> <br />Madge starts things off with the infectious-beyond-words lead single, Hung Up, which rides along on a riff lifted from ABBA's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\" and moves directly into 2 more dead-center hits: Get Together, a trancey, dancey number reminiscent of \\"Holiday,\\" and rumored second single \\"Sorry,\\" that harkens back to ABBA once again. \\"I don't wanna here/I don't wanna know/Please don't say you're sorry,\\" she sings.  Oh, don't worry - we're not sorry we bought this album ;) <br /> <br />All of the songs here are uptempo - even the slower songs (\\"Forbidden Love\\" and the Peggy Lee-like \\"Like it Or Not\\") will have you tapping your feet.  That doesn't mean all of the songs are fluffy and lack substance, though.  Sure, \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\" have lyrics that could have been written or song by any popstar, some of the latter tracks are typical of the modern Madonna. <br /> <br />In \\"How High,\\" Madonna looks back on her rise to fame (\\"How high are the stakes?/How much fortune can you make?\\").  Unlike her last album, though, she isn't preaching here, she's just being honest - and the songs lack the discomfort that came with some of her earlier attempts at self-reflection. <br /> <br />\\"Let It Will Be\\" follows a similar path, but once again it isn't whiney, but winning.  Top it off with some great harmonies and earthy vocals and you have a sure-fire hit. <br /> <br />Are there some pitfalls here?  Sure.  Some of the lyrics are silly (in the rock-y \\"I Love New York\\" she sings about feeling like a dork) and others a bit cliched, but they're never embarrassing.  And few people would say Madonna's words are what attract them to her songs in the first place.  It's always been about the melody and the beat, and Confessions has both in spades.
B00000JCB2|1.0|These guys have very little musical talent. They excell only in putting forth an image. Fred Durst's lyrics on not only this album, but any album, are so LAME as to be embarrasing (\\"and this sh*t right here, we doin it all the time, every day and every night!\\" or whatever). They craft a great image so ignorant teenagers who don't know better will think this is cool and buy the album and feel cool.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This cd is not breaking any new ground or blowing the doors off of the dance music genre, but it is a darn fine pop record and insanely addictive. I can't single out a bad track on it! Yeah some of the lyrics are a bit trite but it is leagues better than some of the crap getting airplay right now. (\\"My Humps\\" comes to mind). It won't disappoint longtime fans and certainly should win her some new ones.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I enjoyed this CD the first time I listened to it, however, I didn't really appreciate how great this CD was until I'd listened to it several times.  I've never had another album grow on me like this one did.  However, be cautious; The CD is made up of several increadibly catchy tracks, however, the tracks all build into one another in a Pink Floydesque fashion.  Therefore, this is the type of CD that should be played front to back in order to understand how terriffic it is.  If you prefer prototypical CD formats (by which I mean several 3 minute songs which can be played in any order), this may not be the CD for you.  The CD demonstrates very catchy guitar and lyrics and great psychadellic electronics, which I typically tend to dislike.  Frances the Mute also demonstrates a very unique sound which I cannot compare to any other albums.  A great addition to anyone's collection.
0684824906|5.0|This is a great book.  One of the best I have encountered on the subject.  I was sorry when I turned the last page.  I would have given it six stars...but that category was not available. Yes...I'm a Civil War amateur historian....and I was so impressed I have told many others about it.  I had to go out and order her book on FDR.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Lord knows, this owman is so tired and played out it is not funny. The only times she has been an interesting artist was when she went looney tunes and tried to kill herself and when that sick girl wrote her a letter and she responded with: \\"Excuse me Miss, but I have problems of my own.\\" Now that was a laugh riot!<br /><br />Here is just a few remixes added to an already craptacular CD. Yes she has a voice, but she only sings unremarkable songs. Her flirtations with brilliance (\\"Honey\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\") are long gone.<br /><br />Save your $$$ and buy the new fabulous Confessions On A Dance Floor. It blows this cow out of the water.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Following the cold reception of her last album, 2003's stiff \\"American Life,\\" Madonna had no choice but to go back to doing what she does best: create hook-infested dance tunes with an edge above their cookie-cutter competition.  On her often thrilling \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor,\\" the 47-year-old mom of two doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel of dance music, as most of the grooves here are familiar to most club heads.  But not since 2003's \\"Erotica\\" has Madonna made an album so aggressively trendy and discocentric; at times it sounds like a Ministry of Sound compilation minus all the electro-cheese.  She and producer Stuart Price (aka Les Rhythmes Digitales) concocted a synth-heavy dance album that boldly wears its influences (Donna Summer, Kraftwerk, Tom Tom Club, Human League) on its sleeve.  The kickoff single, \\"Hung Up,\\" is Eurotrash disco bliss, replete with a clever sample from ABBA's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme.\\"  \\"Get Together\\" is the great track Daft Punk never recorded, and \\"Sorry\\" is a high energy number that screams \\"Giorgio Moroder.\\"  The tempo does drop a bit in the album's second half, but the energy still remains on later cuts like the unapologetic \\"Like it or Not\\" and \\"Push,\\" which borrows the hook from Tom Tom Club's \\"Genius of Love.\\"  Never boring and always sounding fresh,\\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" proves that the Material Girl is anything but immaterial.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Girlfriend got her groove back...big time! This album is simply amazing and the best work she has put out in quite awhile. It blows great works like American Life and Music out of the water! Not one bad/filler song on the entire list. The first 3 songs (Hung Up, Get Together & Sorry) flow so well together, it is hard to keep listening since you'll want to keep going back to the beginning to hear them over and over. Other real stand outs include \\"Push,\\" \\"Let It Will Be,\\" \\"Jump,\\" and \\"Forbidden Love.\\" Again this album is fantastic! The ending tune \\"Like It Or Not\\" is excellent in that Madonna does things her way so lead, follow or get out the way.<br /><br />I hope this album does well. It certianly different and far superior to what accounts for \\"hits\\" in the US these days. No contest winners, no rappers celebrating murdering people and no fat, tired hos like a certain Miss Carey. The album is brilliant!
0441003257|5.0|If Mark Twain had written the Book of Revelations, it might come out like this.  This is a heartwarming, uplifting story about the Apocalypse and the Anti-Christ, amazing as that sounds.  It says a lot about what it means to be human.  And it's very funny. <br /> <br />Adam Young is an eleven-year-old boy who was born to be the Anti-Christ.  However, he was switched at birth by a ditzy satanic nun, and brought up in rural England by a normal couple.  So he grows into a regular kid who's unaware of his powers.  He has a little gang of friends, including a girl named Pippin Galadriel Moonchild (she goes by Pepper.)  Adam is very like a British version of Tom Sawyer.  He has a Hound of Hell who becomes a little mutt named Dog when Adam says he likes small dogs.   Sometimes Dog's eyes glow red, but mostly he's just a loyal little mutt. <br /> <br />The great characters are what I love about this book.  Besides Adam himself, there's a young witch named Anathema Device, the descendent of a witch/prophet who wrote the \\"Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter\\", a book that describes the end days.  (`Nice' means `precise'.)    There is a mad Witchfinder General who thinks it might be good to take turns and let the witches find him for a change.  There are the Four Horsemen, only they're on motorcycles (the original Hell's Angels):  War, Famine, Death, and Pollution (Pestilance having been done away with by penicillin.)   War is a very interesting woman, and Death is the most sympathetic of the four, even though he always speaks in all capitals. <br /> <br />But it's Crowley and Aziraphale who steal the show.  Crowley is the demon who was the snake in the Garden of Eden.  (His name was Crawly then.)  Aziraphale was the angel with the flaming sword who drove out Adam and Eve (but he gave them the sword because he figured they might need it.)  Through the millennia, they've become friends, like secret agents in the field who have more in common with each other than with their higher ups.  They're supposed to help bring about the Apocalypse, but they don't really want to give up their life on earth.  Crowley doesn't want to give up his 1929 Bentley, and Aziraphale doesn't want to give up his used-book store with its amazing collection of rare books (including the original scroll of the Revelation.  He thinks John was a nice guy, but a little too fond of mushrooms.) <br /> <br />I suspect it helps to be familiar with the Book of Revelation to enjoy this book, though I think it would still be pretty funny and sweet if you're not.    When I finished it, I closed it with a sigh of pleasure.   Wonderful ending!  This is a real feel-good book.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I am a big Britney Spears fan, and I have to say that the greatest hits album is great.......I don't know about other people's oponions in a negative way, but this is a great cd if you don't know britney spears and if you do......I advice anyone to go buy it......Great cd people!!Including songs like \\"baby one more time\\" & \\"toxic.\\"
B000BO0LLS|5.0|In reading and thinking about the various reviews concerning this album, I wanted to point out that the 3rd release of The Emancipation of Mimi is indeed a product of corporate greed. However, after being slammed for the past 5 years, I don't really blame Mariah and her company for trying to milk this album for all it's worth. I absolutely adore Miriah Carey, but her previous albums, in my opinion, are much better than Mimi. The best songs on this album are \\"We Belong Together,\\" It's Like That,\\" \\"Say Something,\\" \\"One and Only,\\" and the SOUL stirring \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" All of the other songs, I tend to skip right over. And like I said, I am a huge fan of hers. <br /> <br />Now, comparing Mariah Carey to Jennifer Lopez is like comparing champagne to malt liquor. Listen to Mariah's voice, not to mention the lyrics of her songs, and you'll agree that Jennifer Lopez is an entertainer, and a very good one, while Mariah, as we black folks like to say, is a SANGER. I agree, she needs to limit the number of rappers she uses on her records; they have become somewhat of a crutch for her. And yes, sometimes her songs are repetitive; but when she is really at the top of her game, lyrically and vocally, there are very few R and B female singers that come close her talent. She's no Aretha Franklin or Chaka Khan, but she has much love and respect for black music and black artist that paved the way for her current success, which is more than one can say for La Lopez.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Re-releasing (and doing it for the 3rd time) is unprofessional. <br />It's totally normal (perfect I would say) to charge money for an album, there are high production costs and royalties to pay BUT, when an \\"artist\\" takes advantage of a highly successfull album to release it three times IT IS unprofessional, it shows that the \\"artist\\" isn't making music for it's sake, for love to music or because the \\"artist\\" enjoys making people happy. Instead, it shows that the \\"artist\\" is only for the money and it's our duty not to support those who only want to take our money. <br /> <br />Not only that, but Mariah Carey is an artist who tends to lyp-sinc or use a backing track on her \\"live\\" performances, she sings some parts, the rest is Lipsync and she does that not because she can't reach the notes but because her voice is tired at this point of her career and yet SHE WANTS the money. <br /> <br />We also shouldn't be supporting \\"artists\\" who pretend to have street cred (unlike Jennifer Lopez), or \\"artists\\" who have to airbrush FAKE ABS on her stomach to look like a model. <br /> <br />Mariah Carey should be boycotted. Obviously fans will quickly deny all of this, but the evidence is there, just type in google Mariah Carey fake abs and you'll see what a cheap artist she is. <br /> <br />And last but not least, the cheapest thing is to have not only one version of the tird release but TWO versions (something that could count like a fourth re-release) simply AMAZING...
B00000JPYD|5.0|I remember the first time I heard the song \\"Bridge of Sighs.\\" It was back in 1977. I was driving my car and only three blocks from home when I had to pull over to the side, shut off the engine, and listen to this incredible, haunting song on the radio. The deep throaty voice was awash in a sea of living, breathing guitar riffs. Sheer poetry. Romantic, in the classical sense. I was immediately hooked. Or should I say, \\"moved.\\" Because that's what Robin's music is about. Emotion. Dreams. Mythology. Robin Trower is one of The Titans. <br /> <br />Robin employs broad strokes with bold contrasts in his playing. Or perhaps sculpture is a better metaphor. When I hear his music I can often see his hands at work in my mind's eye. Over the years I've had several chances to see him in action, and I must say that he has the strongest left hand I've ever seen. Sure, he's gone through phases where I thought he abused the whammy bar too much or his sound seemed over-processed, but man, this chap has the most incredible natural vibrato! It must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br />The late great Jim Dewar's voice has broad shoulders. There is no dichotomy between the guitar and vocal on the \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" album; the two are as brothers. This album has so much to commend it. Truly a classic! <br />
0792843584|1.0|I'm not going to get into the self-indulgent reviewers mode here, (other than to say I think this is one of the most underrated movies of all time) but I will say this: if, like me, you have a nice 16:9 big screen; a good DVD player and are looking forward to the gorgeous cinematography... save your money: this is probably the single worst transfer to DVD of all time! It's grainy, inconsistent, poorly transferred (complete with reel-change keyholes) variable from reel to reel, and not corrected for anamorphic distortion. I was terribly disappointed in MGM's sloppy release of one of the most beautiful films ever made.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|This is the 3rd release of the same album, it only changes the cover and adds 4 lame remixes.
0205313426|5.0|I first encountered this timeless little book the first term of my freshman year of college.  My four years there, as an English major, left my copy pretty tattered and torn.<br /><br />It's been almost 18 year since I first picked up this little treasure, and I still refer to it regularly (now to my just-received harcover edition!).  Without a doubt it is the best guide to style and usage ever written, and it is a fraction of the length, and cost, of most.<br /><br />If you want to write well, buy this little gem and read it cover to cover, then refer back to it often.  You'll not be disappointed!
0307276902|5.0|I had a hard time believing that I would not be able to put this book down but I literally read it in 16 hours straight. I really could not put it down. It reminded me so much of things I have struggled with and the feelings that went along with it. This is probably the best book I have ever read and I can not wait to read My Friend Leonard.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Yes it is a re release...that does mean most of the songs are from the previous cd. However, you get four new additional songs. Including the new smash hit :\\"DON'T FORGET ABOUT US\\". I don't understand how the other reviewer said this was a bomb. It is getting huge airplay and climbing up the charts by leaps and bounds...so where's the proof that this song is tanking? <br /> <br />In addition, there are three more new tunes on the cd,\\"SO LONELY\\" an urban remix of \\"WE BELONG TOGETHER\\" and'MAKIN' IT LAST ALL NIGHT\\", the later could be a possible fifth hit single. <br /> <br />The ultra platinum edition includes a dvd of the four hit videos created for this cd, \\"IT'S LIKE THAT\\", \\"WE BELONG TOGETHER\\", \\"SHAKE IT OFF\\" and 'GET YOUR NUMBER\\"(which has only been seen in Europe up until this point. Also includes a link to view the new video as well as an interview of Mariah. <br /> <br />I'd like to see J.Ho have this many hits off one cd in the future. The facts speak for itself who bought \\"Rebirth\\"? Mariah is truly a legend, these wannabes don't have the staying power or talent. How many of these other artists write their own songs? <br /> <br />If you love Mariah you will love the cd, relive the memories all over again and support her.
B00005ABX0|3.0|Smiley Smile simply is the moment when the Beach Boys died. It maybe impossible to imagine now, but up to 1966 the Beach Boys were as respected as artists as the Beatles. Smiley Smile is a rushed album, with practically no instrumentation whatsoever and many under-rehearsed vocals, except for Good Vibrations and Heroes and Villians. If Capitol ever releases a  Smile box set as they promised, Smiley Smile will be then send to oblivion, in the hall of shame where it belongs. The world never took the beach boys seriously after that. Wild Honey is actually a very good album, not better than Pet Sounds or Smile, but different than anything they ever did before. Some of the songs and arrangements are totally Brian Wilson at his best. Some of the 'soul' vocals I find difficult to digest and I miss the Beach boys blend on the songs. The extra tracks on the album are ESSENTIAL to any serious beach boys fan, so, if you are, you need this album.
0679735909|4.0|I feel that I first have to state that I read this only after watching the movie, and that I enjoyed the movie a little more, but for different reasons. I didn't care for the ending of \\"Possession\\", but I'm not about to tell a brilliant writer like A.S. Byatt how to end a brilliant romantic story. I think what sets this apart from all other romances is the fact that it is about two different romances from two different eras, but both being similar, and linked. The mix of poetry, short stories within the story, dialogue and beautiful settings make this a very unique and compelling read. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves classic romance, poetry, English manners and mystery.
B000B8QF14|4.0|As a veteran Green Day fan, the notion of a live release of the American Idiot tour was nothing less than a godsend. Having seen them live during the US portion of the tour in 2004, I was blown away by the incredible show the band put on, and so a CD and DVD capturing the extraordinary energy and epic quality of their performances would seem like a priceless record of Green Day at one of their career peaks.<br /><br />The only problem is, the songs that were cut make a huge difference. No Green Day show is complete without Knowledge, which serves as a sort of centerpiece and the tradition of getting fans to play on the song has been around for years; pity not to see it on here. A live version of Maria is a rare thing and merited inclusion. But the real killer is the absence of We Are The Champions - not only is this a great cover in itself, it captures perfectly the new ambitions of the band as rock superstars. To have it gone is a glaring omission.<br /><br />The live show itself (or the parts of it chosen for the recording) is excellent, and the DVD, although one must sit through the annoying cuts and interviews, is well-produced and gives a good feel for the awe-inspiring experience that is attending a Green Day show.<br /><br />Going back to the setlist, I have always maintained that Green Day is a poor band when it comes to song choice. The same numbers (Longview, Basket Case, She) have literally been played on every tour they have been on, with a smattering of latest-album tracks thrown in (Nice Guys Finish Last was a big deal during the Nimrod tour, and gems like Church On Sunday and Macy's Day Parade were heard during the Warning tour). The stunning back catalogue has remained, so far, largely unperformed (songs like Pulling Teeth, Stuart And The Ave., Walking Alone and Deadbeat Holiday are some of their very best work, yet remain unaired). Thus, even with American Idiot you get a lot of the big hits that grow to be annoying after so much overplay (Holiday is the ideal example), and great songs like Give Me Novacaine and Whatsername are, for some reason, not tour staples. Variation in the setlists is what makes a band a truly great touring outfit (for all of his faults, this is what makes Dave Matthews so popular: every show a different setlist). On this account, Green Day fall very very short and fans purchasing this CD will get strictly the very conventional greatest hits.<br /><br />Lest anyone think I'm just complaining, I suggest several things Reprise could have done to improve the release. Issuing a DVD separate from a double, complete CD (like Rhino did with the Concert For Bangla Desh just last month)would be one option. Issuing a different, more interesting show, like the surprise gig they played in LA during the summer before the release of American Idiot (where they played the album in full, plus old songs and killer covers like Jason White singing Rock The Casbah), would be another.<br /><br />There are other great Green Day live EPs out there, the best of which is \\"Tune In, Tokyo,\\" chronicling the Warning tour. Fans of older Green Day, before the commercial explosion that was American Idiot, may want to start there. \\"Bullet In A Bible\\" is an invaluable document of this stage in Green Day's career, for certain, and I am obligatorily dishing out the money for it. But what it might have been is a whole different question.example), and great songs like Give Me Novacaine and Whatsername are, for some reason, not tour staples.

6305127697|3.0|The life of an altar boy is not an easy one. Worse, when the altar boy has been sexually abused, the anger embedded is deep and dark. Years later when the boy has grown to adulthood and can retaliate against the abuser, the black fury of the past results in a gruesome, violent murder. Thus the premise of Primal Fear is realized in the film of the same name. Richard Gere plays Martin Vail an attorney with superb legal abilities and an inflated ego. However, the motivating power of the movie emanates primarily from the demon plagued Aaron Stampler, superbly played by new comer Edward Norton. The heinous murder of an archbishop sets the stage for a media swamped sensational trial in which the prosecutor seeks the death penalty and the defense tries to explain how two distinct personalities exist within the torturous soul of the young man accused of the crime. Still, a very subtle and unsuspecting nuance snakes itself into the story line, like a threatening viper and if not detected will strike your soul as does the film's conclusion. Great movie and superior acting makes for a worthwhile reason to watch this film. ***
B0000TB01Y|1.0|For pages and pages back, this show has got 5 stars... oh, well. This show seems to appeal to many, but after sampling it myself, decided that it was not for me. The characterisations are dull, the songs are boring after the first playing, the orchestrations pathetic to say the least. The whole show just smacks of \\"appealing to the general mob\\" syndrome which is starting to take over this amazing genre. <br /> <br />The lyrics are tacky and the music predictable. The essance of musical theatre is simply that that is implied by the name - drama for music. There is none of that in this musical. Certainly there's minimal acting in tracks such as \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"Popular\\" - it's not done very well, for starters, and the rest of the tracks feel like disjointed 3-minuters on a pop album. <br /> <br />Save your money for real musical theatre.
0689865384|5.0|I am a teenager who wonders a lot about how far people will go to obtain perfection in beauty and fashion.  Uglies gave me a fantistic view on that subject.  After reading this book, I sat down and reflected for a couple of hours.  Is perfection really worth it in the end?  I looked in the mirror and finally really started to see who I really was and how I was beautiful in my own way.  Uglies gave me a new outlook on life.  Now I don't spend as many mornings worrying about how I look. <br /> <br />I think it's a great read for people of all ages.  It's full of adventure and truths.  You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat.  If you're a mom, this is a great Christmas or birthday present to your daughter.  Uglies is worth every penny you spend.

B000B8QF14|5.0|This is an amazing live cd and DVD but it doesn't really capture everything that goes on at the concert. For instence at the end of the concert in Nashville they played \\"We Are The Champions\\" and I was  EXTREMELY dissapointed not to find it on this, also they played \\"Knowledge\\" by Operation Ivy and they did not have it, and it was so amazing. Bottom line if you have seen the concert you will not be dissapointed with this CD/DVD but you might would have  wanted to relive some of those moments (I know I wanted to),either way get it it has amazing quality and my favorite song (\\"King for A  Day\\"). You Will Not Be Dissapointed, Must Get For ANY Green Day Fan.
B000B8QF14|4.0|CD: 4.5 stars; DVD: 3.5 stars<br /><br />At the conclusion of the ennormously successful \\"American Idiot\\" tour, Green Day now releases it's first full-length live album. To entice fans even more, this comes as a CD/DVD combo package.<br /><br />First the CD: \\"Bullit in a Bible\\" (14 tracks, 65 min.) is evenly divided between 7 A.I. tracks and 7 selections from the past. The band sounds really tight and arena-sized, and the sound quality of the CD is outstanding. Favorite tracks for me include \\"Holiday\\", \\"Longview\\", \\"Brain Stew\\", \\"Basket Case\\", and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\". At 65 min., why didn't they squeeze in two or three more songs, but in the end this is a very enjoyable performance. The DVD is another story altogether (the tracklist of the DVD is listed above in the Amazon listing). Two major complaints: rather than having the show in one section and the interviews with the band in another section, they are all intermixed, severely testing the continuity of the show. Even worse is the incessant editing of the show: the picture shifts to another angle just about every few seconds. I know this is the MTV age of short attention spans, but come on! After a while, it becomes quite annoying. Too bad, as Green Day is clearly at the top if its game musically.<br /><br />In all, this is certainly not a \\"bad\\" CD/DVD combo, but it could've been even better and I know that I will not be playing the DVD all that much. But I'm glad to have the CD in my carousel!
B000B7BRMM|5.0|All of us who know about the immense talent of this artist never could imagine she would be able to surprise so kindly with this album. It possesses all you demand from a CD album; elegance, charm and artistic refinement.<br /><br />If you additionally sum the velvet and sweet voice and the fabulous arrangements, I don' t have any doubt we are talking about a historical performance. You should buy this album at least twice; one for you and one for your most fellow human being. It ' s simply a wonderful gift for these times and also an invaluable musical treasure to share over and over always.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Love Madonna, Loved American Life, usually cool with Madonna switching back and forth with her musical gears, but I am not in tune with this CD.  I am probably in the minority here, but I just didn't like it.  I like Hung Up, then the next 2 songs on the CD were just OK, track 4 I fast forwarded thru and got to track 5 \\"I Love New York\\" and I was thinking \\"you've got to be kidding\\".  The song is horrible.  Bad lyrics, no fun at all.  I fast forwarded to track 6 and was also disappointing so I just finally stopped listening.  This would be great background music at a party, but I can't see myself listening to it over and over again. It's not horrible, it's just not that great. Where are the great lycrical hooks you want to sing along with over and over?  Where are the great musical hooks that make you want to groove?  It's just a bunch of beats and words.  I love Madonna, but this is not moving me at all.  If you love good dance music, get Bananarama's new CD \\"Drama\\".  It is amazing with great hooks throughout.  What a good pop/dance album should be.
B00005MJ13|5.0|It is very difficult to maintain the serene objectivity and required tact when we are talking about Ferenc Fricsay. Specially when we have to mention one of the most reminded and well known Symphonic works that for so many years has engaged and captivated the great audiences all over the whole world.<br /><br />I have listened this recording at least sixty times (one more before making this review). What Fricsay achieved with the hundred musicians of the Berlin was simply incredible. The performance is filled of undeniable vitality, sweeping energy, stylized phrasing and mercurial passion. Such evidence of fervor and emotive conviction to be true, I have never listened in any other recording recorded previously and pitifully recently. Such Dionysian rapture you will never find in any other performance, and believe me I have intended with Toscanini, Kertsez, Munch, Keilberth, Kubelik-Berlin( my Fifth choice), Kubelik-Chicago, Giulini-Chicago,  Reiner, Bernstein, Ormandy, Fiedler, Stokowski, Horenstein,  Muti, Mr. K, Klemperer , Dorati and Paray. Vaclav Smetacek (my second choice) , Vaclav Talich (Third choice) and Vaclav Neuman (Fourth choice) are exuberant and definitively inspired but are so far respect this one, that you may consider I am exaggerating.<br /><br />Additionally we have two minor works in what artistic ambition concerns: Die Moldau is played with such charge of passion, interpretative fierceness and delicate lyricism as you never listened previously.<br /><br />The Preludes have a serious rival: Fiedler-Boston Pops, but it is ambitious and notably expansive.<br /><br />In synthesis, if you consider these three gems included in just one CD, well you are rewarded twice. The sound is superb.<br /><br />Please, go for it. It will never let you down. An authentic musical treasure and a fabulous legacy for the new generations to come.
0385486804|5.0|I originally read \\"Into the Wild\\", about seven years ago, but recently read the book again.  It is a sad, but very well told story of Chris McCandless, who in 1992 hiked into the Alaskan wilderness with just a few pounds of food and gear, to live off of the land.  Unfortunately, Chris, who had learned to survive off of little food and who found much more pleasure in reading Tolstoy than watching television, didn't make it out alive. Hunters found his body four months later in an abandoned bus with film, and a diary. Although the story made some headlines at the time, Krakauer, who seems to have greatly identified with Chris, investigated his life before his fatal journey. Through McCandless' diaries and the people whom he encountered on previous travels, Krakauer is able to tell the story of Chris after he graduated college and gave all of his savings to charity. We find that Chris not only abandons his possesions, but also his family who was deeply concerned about him.  Although some aspects of Chris' personality seem inspiring, others others seem selfish.  Despite this, it is impossible to not feel saddened by his fate. Although very intellectual, quoting Thearou, Tolstoy, and London, he had a personality that could connect with \\"the common man\\", and could inspire many others.  Some people have criticized Chris for being unprepared and too idealistic. Of course those things are true about him. Who in there right mind would only bring a few pounds of rice into the Alaskan wilderness? However, most people who criticize him probably would not have even had the nerve to attempt living in the wilderness alone anywhere-much less Alaska. Chris is far from perfect, but has a greatness.  This greatness is the drive he possessed to live out his ideals to find happiness.  In letters that he writes, he truly sounds happy and convicted to his ideals. If you want to read a book, that will stay with you for weeks, or even years to come, read this book!
B0006ZFQN0|5.0|The early and unfair departure of Ferenc Fricsay (49) not only left the world in an orphanage state but deprived it of one of the most perfect and extraordinary conductors of the XX Century. Mr. K would not have been director of the Berlin Philharmonic and the musical legacy of this sumptuous orchestra would have been absolutely different in a positive way. The wisdom, accuracy and genius of Fricsay would have permeated and even maintained the fevered temperament of F&uuml;rtwangler who previously had adverted in Fricsay, let 's say without preambles, his natural successor.<br /><br />The tempos in the Triple Concert are slow, but loaded of fevered expressiveness and Beethoven ethos. Fricsay achieved supported by this outstanding trio and the grateful Orchestra an impeccable and magisterial recording. After you listen it you really feel a cathartic experience. Just the aristocratic phrasing of the last movement: it is amazing:<br /><br />The Double Concerto is extraordinary too. Filled of charm, aristocratic profile and sumptuous musicality with opulence and distinctive flair. Class and musculature shake hands in this brilliant and unusual performance.<br /><br />On the other hand think it over. If Deutsche Gramophone decided to include between the Great Recordings of its collection, that `s by itself, must mean something additional.<br /><br />Go for this notable surprising and breathtaking performance. A true audiophile gem.<br /><br />Eloquent musicality, sublime grandness!
B000BGH22W|4.0|Partick Doyle is given the impossible task of living up to John Williams and does so very admirably. The score does hint at the prior ones written by Williams and William Ross (who simply adapted Willams for Chamber of Secrets), but overall until I see the film, I cannot say that this is an excellent score. A great one, but not good. I did not consider the \\"rock\\" at the end of the CD when writing this review, as that is a marketting ploy by Warners to apeal to those who normally would not buy the CD. <br /> <br />P.S. To those who gave this score a lower grade, please give it a second chance because it is a good score, its just different, which is not always a bad thing.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Lasse Hallstrom evades the anecdotic character, thanks his personal style and particular superb good taste at the moment of handling the camera, getting the instantaneous spell to submerge us immediately in this battleground of ancient prejudices and the accustomed religious corset, expressed through a visible air of self sufficiency and respect for the traditions. All the scandal arouses when a free spirited woman makes her appearance in a small community trying to survive with a chocolate shop, and making of those unique smells and delicious artworks a true magic carpet ride through new universes of sensations of different nature and intensity.<br /><br />The rest goes for you at the moment to acquire this sublime and perfect film that reminded so much Babette ` s Feast in what the perennial conflict between tradition and innovation. Not only an unforgettable masterpiece, but a feast to the taste and eyes.<br /><br />Juliette Binoche (one of my top favorite actress actually) is lovable, alluring and perfect in this role as well as the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Magnificent and sublime.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna has done many things in her three-decade career: she's been an actress, a author, and of course a singer but her music has often developed far beyond where it initially began - the dance clubs of New York City at the end of the disco era. Now after sampling basically every other style, Madonna returns to with an album custom made not for the top 40 but for the dancefloor that spawned her and where she has returned time and again with remixes these many years but never a proper dance album. 'Confessions' delivers - it doesn't deliver so much in the 'confessions' department (the lyrics are standard Madonna's politics, Madonna talks about fame, etc) but she gets the dancefloor part right; the beat never dies in this hour-long festival.<br /><br />The early hype for this album was that Madonna was going to 're-invent dance music for a new generation' - this sets the bar high, and this is not exactly accomplished, but what is taking the best of the past and a ear for the cutting edge and putting it together - and the result is slick, cool and precise. The set's first single \\"Hung Up\\" is really nothing to go by - all hiNRG and chaotic - the rest of the album takes it down a bit, this is after-midnight dance. This is 'Ray of Light' taken to another level, this music is best appreciated when not sober. It is aurally strong - it is not so much a wall of sound but like a fog that comes out of the speakers and envelops the listener. Madonna's voice is not in the lead like most of her records but far back in the mix - she if anyone knows that dance music is about the beat, and words are meant to be played, repeated and thrown - not necessarily emphasized.<br /><br />The album is not short of hooks though - songs like 'Get Together', 'Sorry', 'Jump' - these have hooks like the classic Madonna records and the rest, such as 'Future Lovers', 'Forbidden Love' have faraway, haunting vocals where one or two lines are repeated, weaving in and out of the music. The album is designed to not have stops and starts but to flow from one song into the next and avoid silence, this is done well, but with mainly one producer at the helm (Stuart Price), Price's signature sound tends to become samey, Price for all his musical gifts is not a Mirwais or Pat Leonard who created distinctive beats for each song and 'Confessions' tends to blur into one, leaving, again, Price's wizardry to create distinction between songs.<br /><br />'Confessions' is an album like no other Madonna album nor any pop album at the moment - on the artist's own terms, doing what that artist does best, once again, not designed for the play-it-safe top 40 but the wild world of the clubs. Madonna's stab at 'future disco' comes out splendidly well.designed to not have stops and starts but to flow from one song into the next and avoid silence, this is done well, but with mainly one producer at the helm (Stuart Price), Price's signature sound tends to become samey, Price for all his musical gifts is not a Mirwais or Pat Leonard who created distinctive beats for each song and 'Confessions' tends to blur into one, leaving, again, Price's wizardry to create distinction between songs. <br /> <br />'Confessions' is an album like no other Madonna album nor any pop album at the moment - on the artist's own terms, doing what that artist does best, once again, not designed for the play-it-safe top 40 but the wild world of the clubs.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|I would give 5 stars, but because of her ranting and put downs towards society-She gets a star docked. Other than her talkin like she's better than everyone else, this album is good. Every song is good (even the really cheesy I love NY) and it just makes me want to move. Which is nice because with winter fastly approaching, the depression wanting to sink in...pop in this cd and listen/move my cares away. Nothing deep, just easy breezy feel good fun.
B00079FUI6|5.0|A great addictive tv show that gets you hooked. I love this show and watch it every week and I cant miss an episode. The first episdoe was not the greatest but after it all the rest was good. The story lines keep you guessing and hooked. Why did Mary Alice kill herself? What is the real story of Mike the plumer? and much more. The season has funny moments, sad moments, and shocking moments that lead up to the cliffhanger season fianl. Overall this is a must own if you heard about the show and havent watched it and for die hard fans of the show.
055321263X|5.0|I really liked this book. It had a romantic appeal and vivid, memorable characters. The plot was also fantastic. Wilkie wrapped up everything quite nicely at the end--I won't say anymore for those who haven't read it. I didn't feel there were any unbelievable coincidences in the plot. It was a little slow at first, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Some parts were hilarious. This book has it all. I would definitely recommend it.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I would like to first say that it kills me that people can hate something they probably haven't even listened to!!! They just don't like Madonna, so they are wasting their precious life to write about her. Anyway, am I surprised?!!! I love this cd. Hung up is hard hitting, and then we go to \\"get together\\" which is a throwback to 80's club music. \\"Sorry\\" is pure brilliance, and just when I was thinking the album couldn't get better, it does. Madonna sings about loving new york, future lovers, and even forbidden love. However, when she wants us to \\"jump\\", I was awestruck, and ready to do so. What a great song! There is even a song on the album to her man called \\"push\\". It is a suprisingly good love song with a dance beat. Only madonna could do that. She then gives us Isaac. This song completely blew me away. She named the song after the guy who is chanting in it, not the great Kabbalist. She ends the album with \\"like it or not\\". Wow only madonna could end an all dance album with a few acoustic guitar strings. The queen is back in full form. This is a must have for any fan, or soon to be fan.
0446577383|4.0|Baldacci and I have not mixed well. There are so many authors who just spark from the start of the novel. That is not Baldacci's strong point. The Camel Club is representative of that. The members of the club and the Agent Ford, and his lady Kate are wonderful characters. The bad guys are interesting. BUT the action is SOOOOOOOOSLOOOOW it takes over 300 pages to see what ties everything together and this event is kind of not quite as believable as hoped. Once it happens, however, it reads much faster. But there are few pages after that. If you want to hang in and go through the book, get this one. If you are a Baldacci fan, get this. If you compare this to a Preston/Child, Greg Iles, John Case, you get the picture, Baldacci doesn't zip like others.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Friends is a sit com with a simple premise.  It follows six friends as they deal with the challenges of early adulthood in New York City.<br /><br />Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled woman learning to live on her own for the first time.  Her roommate Monica (Courtney Cox Arquette) is a clean freak chef.  Monica's brother Ross (David Schwimmer) is a nerdy paleontologist.  Across the hall from Monica and Rachel are Chandler (Matthew Perry), a sarcastic office worker, and struggling actor Joey (Matt LeBlanc).  Rounding out the group is free spirit Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) who makes her living as a message therapist and freelance guitarist.  They are usually hanging out at an apartment or the coffee house they all love, Central Perk.<br /><br />Over the course of ten seasons, the show managed to get all the characters through a lot of trials.  They all had many romantic relationships start and fail and all were out of work at one point or another.  Through it all, the friends stuck by each other.<br /><br />Those friendships are one of the things that continue to draw me to the show.  With a few exceptions, any squabbles will be patched up by the time the half hour is over.  If only friends stayed this close in real life.<br /><br />And of course, the show is funny.  From Chandler's one-liners to Joey's ignorant statements of fact or Monica's desire for order, these characters could be counted on to make you laugh.<br /><br />The one storyline that stretches from the pilot to the finale is Ross and Rachel's romantic relationship.  They almost get together and break up so many times, it gets frustrating after a while.  Their relationship is a main focus of the early seasons, but begins to take a back seat to other storylines as the series progresses.  Except, of course, when it's time for a season cliffhanger.  All but one season ended with some twist to the story.  Frankly, it got a little tiresome by the end, but it only detracts a little.<br /><br />Maybe dragging out the Ross/Rachel storyline is one reason for it, but the later seasons do loose a little of their charm.  The early seasons had a warmth to them that later seasons seemed to loose.  I find I enjoy watching the earlier seasons better then the later ones even though the later ones are still entertaining and funny.  Later seasons do, for example, feature Phoebe finding a man to marry and Monica and Chandler's marriage and struggles with having kids.  And, of course, there's Joey's triumphant return to Days of Our Lives and movie debut.<br /><br />This set has everything a fan could want.  All ten seasons of the show are here with a collectable cover to keep the smaller sets in.  The episodes features original full frame picture and 5.1 surround sound.

B000AP04NI|1.0|I'm talking about this brand new 2DVD set of Oklahoma! 50th Anniversary, released on November 15th 2005. The concept is great, 2 discs, disc one is a CinemaScope version, disc two is a Todd-AO 70MM version, with proper widescreen aspect ratio & great sound. But the picture quality on Todd-AO version is a real garbage. Very soft, fuzzy & lack of definition as if you're watching a second generation VHS copy! The 70MM source material for this transfer is extremely bad and suffers from a severe color fading. The cinemaScope version on disc one looks much better & sharper although the color balance & color timing is totally wrong and it suffers from an extensive electronic edge enhancement, some video artifacts & color bleeding. This is not what it should be. Generally speaking, films shot in 70MM format should have far superior image & color quality than 35MM CinemaScope, but not this DVD transfer. 20th Century fox Home Video has done nothing but insult consumers. If they think they can get away with this, forget it. They can fool me once but not twice. My advice? Don't buy this DVD set. Rent it to see some wonderful special features, especially on disc two, and listen to a soundtrack, wich is very nicely remastered, but not for the image quality.
B00005JNX0|3.0|UPDATE - Jan. 2007    Well, you never know...    A while after that first viewing (described in the review below, from September 2005), this movie came on cable, so I taped it \\"just in case.\\" Well, it feels a bit different on the small screen, and our kid liked it -- although some reassurances were still needed at first to get past worries about the biting, clawing, and so on.    By the second or third viewing, we were all enjoying it about equally, and the inherent \\"violence\\" of the food chain had been accepted because our child was a bit older, and had learned more about science, nature -- the circle of life, so to speak.    I still do not think it is appropriate for most kids 5 or under, but now that time has passed, we like this a lot more than we did after that first movie viewing, and we've watched it frequently. One finds a lot of details on repeat viewings that one misses the first time, and there are plenty of jokes that work different ways for adults and kids. By the party music during the final credit roll, we are all dancing!    I'm leaving the original review intact, because it was an honest assessment of the film at that time, and a description of a real experience.    ----------- ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS -----------  \\"Reasonable entertainment one time but not worth owning\\"    I saw this in a theater full of five-year-old kids at a birthday party. If ever there were a setup for a great response to a movie, that would have been it. Well, the movie started, then went on... and on... the kids didn't laugh much and hardly moved except perhaps to squirm in their seats. The movie would get going occasionally, the kids would respond, then the story would drop to low gear again. Yawn.    Sure, there were high spots of interest, and our kid particularly liked the King Lemur and his silly song and dance. But none of the main characters made a true, lasting impression on our child, nor were we asked for Madagascar toys afterward. THAT is a real indicator, I think.We have toy lions, giraffes, hippos and zebras -- and when playing, our 5-year-old never reassigns them to play the characters in this film. By contrast, the lion toys are often used to act out \\"The Lion King\\" for one good example. If Madagascar had really made an impression, we'd have seen it being re-enacted at home. But it never happened.    I'm a huge fan of Chris Rock, and I like Ben Stiller. I wanted to see this movie succeed not just because I like those performers, but also because as parents, we can always use another good kid movie for the home collection, to stretch out the repeats of other stuff we've watched a zillion times. But I do not think this one fits the bill.    Parents of young kids should note that PG rating. Yes, folks, there really IS a difference between \\"G\\" and \\"PG\\" and the PG means your kids are depending on your guidance for what they see. This film is a little rough around the edges with some mildly scary violence, crass jokes and so on. Other reviewers always mention the penguins, but frankly I think most young kids will not get that humor at all. The stuff the penguins do is funny to grownups, but kind of mystifying to little ones.    The setup -- the animals wanting to get out of New York -- will also make a lot more sense to older kids and adults than it will to young ones. The \\"humor\\" revolving around captive animals having to adjust to life in the wild? Kindergartners can understand stuff like that if you talk about it, especially when applied to real animals and so on. But I do not think they can pick up that this problem is a motivating plot force in this movie.     The animals are escaping from the zoo, yeah, and that's easy to grasp. But this is not just about escaping. This movie is about four characters learning how to return to a natural existence, and how to keep their relationships intact in the process. If that sounds HEAVY, well, you're right -- it is! I don't think the producers really understood what film they were making, or that the theme described above is too subtle and intellectual a concept to serve as the foundation for an animated comedy.    And some kids will probably be a little wigged out by the way Alex, the natural carnivore who never had to hunt when he lived in the zoo, struggles not to turn his friends into a meal as he gradually adjusts to the wild life on Madagascar. In other words, the change in these relationships makes sense to adults, but might confuse and bother a young child.    Maybe older kids might dig this more. Maybe not. As for parents who think this is better than Shark's Tale, I totally disagree.     For a long time, I tried to avoid letting our kid see Shark's Tale when it came on TV, because I thought it would be too violent and that the humor might be too adult. One night we ended up watching some of it by accident, and our child was fine with it, to my great surprise.     All the mafia jokes in Shark's Tale were completely over the head of our five-year-old, of course. But the writing was so ingenious that those scenes still worked great for a kid's film. It had a clearcut, obvious story, with a clearcut, obvious central character, who has a clearcut, obvious plot resolution. And it has physical humor that is carefully paced throughout the film, in ways that keep kids attentive.     Madagascar has none of those things. And as much as I like the actors in this film, the voice work does not come ANYWHERE NEAR that of Shark's Tale, or most other good animated films that you might consider. Many parents will want to like this film for reasons I've already mentioned -- but I really believe that its creators were thinking like adults -- not kids -- when they wrote it and produced it. A good children's movie has to be *charming*, not just hyperactive. This one, unfortunately, lacks that charm.

And shes not trying to be Mariah Carey or (god forbid) Celine Dion.  This album is #140 on the RS 500 list, and it deserves to be there, dont write Blondie off as new wave rock novelty....no way.. Parallel Lines is a classic! It sure beats all this teeny, rappy, \\"Im cool\\" sort of trash tunes that bombards our hearing once in a while. I got an idea ....lets tie up all these pukes and MAKE THEM listen to Parallel Lines over and again until they realize how awesome this album is. ... OK Im ok...I just hate kids, thats all. Ok thanx for listening.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This is a really good price for what this platinum edition is. It's her entire Emancipation of Mimi album (which is terrific), plus the \\"We Belong Together\\" remix and 3 additional songs. The separate DVD has the four music videos that have been released from this album thus far and material you can get off of your computer if it will take the disc. The cover art and the booklet are also different from the regular Emancipation CD or even the special edition. This is really something for fans of Mariah or those who were waiting to get The Emancipation of Mimi CD and can now get a version w/ much more for a reasonable price. The best songs on this CD are \\"We Belong Together\\" (the remix is also pretty good), \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Your Girl\\", \\"Joyride\\" and \\"Don't Forget About Us\\". \\"It's Like That\\" is a fun song, but it's not at the same caliber as many of her other hits. All in all, this is a great CD that didn't need any improvement on the original, but the platinum edition is fun for people who are big fans.

B000BO0LKY|5.0|Right now this platinum edition is at the same price as the original album, but has 4 additional songs. The original needed no improvement, but this is great for Mariah fans. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" and the \\"We Belong Together\\" remix are already being played on the radio every day, so I'm glad that we have the opportunity to buy the album w/ those songs included. Other than that, the platinum edition has different pictures in the cover booklet w/ more of a 'platinum' theme rather than the gold theme of the regular and limited editions. This is a must for fans and anyone who doesn't already have \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\". It now has 4 additional songs and a better cover. There's no excuse not to buy this terrific album that deserved to be at #1 on the charts for as long as it was.

B000067CQK|2.0|Not only is Ziggy Stardust among the best rock albums ever made and a work of art to last the ages it is also one of my desert-island discs.<br /><br />I actually am not too bothered about there being 2 discs and I actually wouldn't mind paying a bit more for a well-designed and well-packaged overall cd.  Although I like the overall design concept of a booklet the way it's done here, they totally screwed up when they tried to execute the plan.<br /><br />Firstly, they have to redo this with more hardy cardboard or paper as it's really easy to tear this package apart.  I'm actually afraid to read the liner notes for fear the whole thing will fall apart.  Secondly, they have to make it easier to remove the cds without scratching them.  Otherwise, the liner notes in booklet form is actually quite good.<br /><br />Now for the really bad news: they have to do a MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTER job of remastering the first disc.  The first track starts out very soft and actually sounds muddy with each passing track until it reaches the tour de force and my favourite track, \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" where it sounds like it could actually have been remastered before ending with a whimper.  What a shame and to actually call this a 30th anniversary edition!<br /><br />Ironically, the 2nd disc is much more interesting and actually some of the tracks sound like they had been really well remastered.  So what if you can get some of the tracks on the Ryko Disc version which I fortunately also own, the other tracks are quite good and it was nice to hear Bowie do a version of the old Chuck Berry standard, \\"Reelin' and Rockin'\\".<br /><br />Perhaps they should have let the guy who remastered disc 2 do disc 1 as well.  Actually, the Ryko disc version which isn't advertised as a remastered disc sounds a whole lot better than disc 1.  Perhaps they should have designed a more robust packaging and let Ryko do the cds.<br /><br />I'd really like to see them try again with my above suggestions.  Of all the \\"sins\\" they've done, surely the mediocre quality of disc 1, the main course, has to be the most mortal.  What a shame!gestions.

B000BJS4OY|1.0|Warning!  This CD may or may not be infected with the notorious ROOTKIT device which, when installed, can cause critical damage to your PC.  This nasty little trojan holds your computer hostage and puts your safety in high risk.  And for what?  Copy protection?  Sony has NO business treating us like criminals.  We love music and we're doing nothing wrong!  Nothing!  Even if \\"Born to Run\\" isn't copy-protected, I still wouldn't buy it, because Sony is the most evil corporation in history.  They're a bunch of crooks and thugs.  Everything they do is vile!  If Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, and George Michael left Sony, then you know they're bad!
B000003TAL|5.0|I was too young to be a fan when this came out, but I'd heard good things and picked it up a month ago on a whim. I've been listening to it on and off ever since. It's incredible. The first time I heard it all the way through, I didn't really understand what was so good about it and actually did not like it too much. Over time, you develop a certain appreciation for it. These songs are not simple two minute pop songs, they are drawn out and take time to develop. As such, you will not love it on a first listen. Sometimes I find the \\"noise\\" solos to be a bit too excessive, but for the most part they are bearable. There are some tracks that I don't like as much as others (Rain King, 3rd Trilogy: Eliminator Jr being the only two) but the others are real moody and/or brilliant. Guitar work and various use of tones are amazing. The lyrics are nice because they never detract from the song... does anyone else feel like they were mixed to be more quiet in comparison to the music? Maybe that's just me. I've talked this to death. Just go give it a shot, but remember to listen to it three times through (at the very least) before writing it off as not your cup of tea.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah still has it goin' on.  Period.  I've been a Mariah fan since she first came out back in 1990.  She was amazing then and continues to be.  As a musical artist, she's consistently never failed to continue to release new albums with new songs and different styles and different tastes.  People bash her, saying that they don't like how she's doing the \\"same thing\\" over and over again.  She writes her own stuff and despite the misinformation of one reviewer on here that stated Madonna has sold more albums.. get the facts straight.  Mariah is the biggest female recording artist in history and continues to be.  She's sold more albums worldwide than Madonna has and frankly, Madonna's music these days blows.  Madonna's only good material was back in the 80's, along with her 80's bangs.<br /><br />Mariah Carey's release of this Platinum Edition is nice because it's offered in conjunction with videos on DVD.  I love that.  Not very many artists have a demand or even a desire to do that.  So, thank you Mariah!<br /><br />While people feel that Mariah's ripping people off with re-releases and this and that.. frankly, it's called GOOD MARKETING.  She keeps getting sales, keeps getting her name out, releasing hits, etc.  With most people stealing her stuff through downloading, props to Mariah for keeping a competitive edge out there.  With \\"artists\\" like Ashlee Simpson, Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears, and Hilary Duff out there.. it's nice to see a true professional artist that deserves this attention and the sales get what she deserves.
B00004XONN|5.0|I prefer this album over every other Radiohead album... yes even the sacred Ok Computer. Why? Well for one, it was entirely unlike anything the band had done before. It used computer effects and strange spacey effects in a much different fashion than the albums before it. Most of the songs here arent even driven by guitar anymore.  <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, I enjoy every song (though \\"Treefingers\\" and \\"In Limbo\\" are my least favorites, the rest are equally great). I found some of the songs (\\"Morning Bell\\" & \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" in particular) to be emotionally moving... which is something I hardly ever experience when listening to music. Whether or not this is because of where I was in my life at this point is up for debate, but one cannot deny the overall ominous or depressing mood in these songs in particular. Honestly, when was the last time you were  affected on an emotional level by a song? That is the telltale sign of a great album.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I don't much see what the merits of this soundtrack have to do with John Williams' absense (taking nothing away from him - he's been great).  The real question is: 1.) Is the music good?, and 2.) Does it compliment the movie?  It's not much more difficult than that, really.   <br />Most bloggers/reviewers thus far see this as a two-part disc and critique it thusly: the first part Patrick Doyle's stuff, the second, Jarvis Cocker's.  I understand that and will follow suit. <br />I happen to think the Patrick Doyle arrangements are gorgeous, foreboding, enchanting, ethereal, and adroitly crafted for what each setting calls for.  They sound good, so there.   <br />As for Jarvis Cocker, who is the primary reason I bought this thing.  If you are one who happens to be laughing at, instead of with him, I hate to bear bad news, but the joke is most certainly on you.  If you don't like the way the songs sound, fine.  I can't imagine that, but it happens.  As for lyrics, the refreshing thing about Cocker's allusions to the Harry Potter world is that they're humorous without being cynical.  And it's his deadpan, minus the cynicism, that earns him criticism from dour-faced types who \\"take their music seriously\\" (even the stuff that's supposedly unserious.)  Jarvis Cocker takes the making of good music seriously, and recognizes that good music is, sometimes, mirthful.  That's the difference between him and them. <br />But how does it sound? <br />\\"Do The Hippogriff\\".  I laugh out loud every time I hear this song and it's litany of references.  It sounds like a cross between Billy Idol and The Cult, I swear - it's hilarious. <br />\\"This Is the Night\\" has a macabre tone with a very quirk-jerky beat.  It reminds me of something from their Masters of the Universe collection. <br />\\"Magic Works\\".  If this song had been written then, I would have danced to it at my wedding.  It is perfect Jarvis Cocker (Pulp) ala, \\"Happy Endings\\", \\"The Birds In Your Garden\\", and \\"Bad Cover Version\\". <br />I'm thoroughly impressed with his offerings, and those of the ones who helped him.  I suspect I'll be listening to this for many future nights, unless the Deatheaters come and get me in my sleep. <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Believe the hype. It's good. I stopped listening to it for awhile and recently rediscovered it. It sounds very fresh and unique. I don't really have much else to say except if you are a fan of music, you'll like it. It's very accessible. Enjoy it.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|There's so much good in this album. It's almost apoligetic for her dreadful self-centered \\"American Life\\". Lots of good beats and hooks lay throught the CD. Unfortunetely, Confessions crashes into a mess in the final three tracks. Issac is more of her efforts to publicize Kaballah. Push is just a generally weak cut. Like It Or Not is just more forgettable music. Yes, she gets self centered and hypocrytical on I Love New York (\\"Paris and London you can keep\\"? Uh, didn't she move from NYC to London?) but at least you can take it as a love letter to the NYC dance seen. Future Lovers could almost be a sequal to Ray Of Light, while Jump could easily be another single. If one can overlook the problems of Confessions, you can enjoy this album.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Who cares about indie cred? Who cares if it was overhyped by rock magazines? The songs are catchy, fun, entertaining... why listen to music for any other reason? They haven't experienced massive radio play as some other reviews have said. However, if they did, this would be a good thing: ever notice how every band on pop radio sounds the same? The strokes would be a healthy alternative. I say let them go mainstream (though I'll bet it won't ever happen... their songs simply aren't as widely accessible as is necessary to become a mainstream staple band).
B000BO0LLS|5.0|The hits It's Like That, We Belong Togeterher, Shake It Off and Don't Forget About Us, no need to say anything cuz everyone already knows. But other than those 4 songs, this album is like a treasure of wonderful songs probably many of them won't get released as singles and people who didn't buy this CD won't listen, which will be a huge loss for them. So to add the glory of \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Say Something\\", \\"Stay The Night\\" (Kanye West produced), \\"Circles\\", \\"Joy Ride\\", \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" (one of the best Gospel affords lately) and all others to your ears, just buy this! You won't be disappointed.
1932100385|5.0|This review is modified from my comments on \\"Carbophobia,\\" as a response to a Hostile Reviewer. I'm afraid I might have been just a teeny little bit sarcastic, there, but I've revised it and added it here because it has a high degree of relevance. In defending \\"Carbophobia,\\" I wax eloquent about my own masculine beauty:     I've been effectively vegan since the Carter era (ah, youth!), with maybe some butter once in a while. Nothing dead since Iran was our friend (thanks, Carter). I'm not hoary with years, but no longer a mere slip of a boy, and my biometrics put me in my mid-twenties. When I'm trained (last year) my resting heartrate is 43 bpm, and I run a 5 minute mile and a 3:20 marathon; I can squat 600 pounds, dip twice my body weight (180) ten times (that's, um, like, uh, 360 pounds or something!), and I've nearly got my one-armed chinup. My body fat is somewhere under 10%, and I have that delightful and intriguing masculine shape, complete with abs, pecs, lats, and even [pause for dramatic effect] delts. Gee, I'm terrific! So am I saying this (if it's true) because I want vicarious admiration? Yes, I want vicarious admiration. But also because I think I pretty much demonstrate the fact that meat is in every sense optional.    The Hostile Reviewer asserts that meat is not \\"unhealthy\\" -- I'm sure he meant \\"unhealthful\\" -- adducing carnivores as evidence. It's been years, decades, really, since I went through all this, but I still recall that the intestinal tract of carnivores is many times shorter than that of herbivores; since we are neither c. nor h., our i.t. is intermediate -- something like five times longer than comparable meat-eaters; the point being that meat doesn't sit and ferment...rot...in a cat's colon, the way it did in John Wayne's [yes, I know it's an urban legend]. Anyone can find this sort of info on the hippy-dippy veggie sites...they're not wrong, just...um...artistic. It may or may not be true that \\"Humans have been eating meat since time immemorial\\" [Anno Domini 1199?], but given the differences in GI structure between carnivores and humans, the plaintive query \\"If meat was so unhealthy how could carnivores ever exist?\\" answers itself. In any case, horses outlive lions, 28 years to 16 -- that's like, uh, twice as long or something. Upshot is, Are we carnivores? No duh. Are we dedicated herbivores? Get along with you. We *can* eat just about anything -- but what is most healthful?    As for the inadaquacy of a vegetarian diet, we need only consider the beasts of the field -- say, the bovine staple of the Troglodyte Diet -- which eat, um, grass. Maybe some grasshoppers and lady bugs that don't elude the heft of a slobbery tongue, but mostly grass, right? I don't know what the incidence of osteoporosis in wild buffalo is, but I don't think it's endemic. As for protein: \\"nutrients from animal-based foods increase tumor development while nutrients from plant-based foods decrease tumor development.\\" The consistancy of lab findings \\"was stunningly impressive...\\" [The China Study, p. 66.]    Regarding \\"unhealthy,\\" as The China Study points out, a study funded by The Atkins Center revealed that subjects on that diet for half a year suffered constipation (68%), bad breath (63%), headaches (51%), hair loss (10%), and a 53% increase in calcium excreted in urine [cf. TCS, p. 96]. An Austrialian review of the data points out low-carb dangers of heart arrhythmias and contractile problems, impairment of physical activity, osteoporosis, lipid abnormalities, kidney damage, increased risk of cancer, and sudden death [TCS, p. 97]. Ouch. Atkins himself died weighing 258 lbs; even if this was fluid retention related to his coma, the 195 lbs claimed for him by a spokesman is concidered overweight, a BMI score of 26.4. His heart disease and high blood pressure may have been from insalubrious diet, or, as claimed, from a viral infection of the heart -- which hardly suggests a healthy immune system. All this cannot conceivably indicate a \\"health\\" diet -- at best, it could only be a weight-loss diet, apparently at the cost of being a health-loss diet.    The Hostile Reviewer asserts that \\"When people lose weight on high carbohydrate diets they always lose muscle and bone at the same time, sometimes as much as 40% ... from lean tissue...\\" Perhaps he's referring to the *Bonbons Seulement* Diet we've been hearing so much about? The Black Hole of Calcutta Diet? The Bataan Death March Diet? Just a hint: sensible diet and sensible exercise, together. Actually, for a sustainable diet, both animal and plant proteins are associated with greater weight, but \\"Greater plant protein intake [is] closely linked to greater *height* and body weight.\\" [TCS, p. 103; emphasis added.] Third Worlders tend to be smaller not because plant protein is inferior, but because of insufficient dietary variety, quantity and quality, poor public hygiene, and prevalent childhood disease -- in other words, because of poverty.    I shall refrain from a descent into the minutia of high-carb v high-protein. But honestly, does either extreme sound sensible? How about *adequate*, or *optimal* carbs, amino acids and EFAs? It's not a \\"boys are better than girls\\" argument, after all; both are sorta necessary.     If we make the issue one of definitions, we must concider what I call \\"muffin vegetarians\\", where the issue isn't about health at all, and those people may be dropping like bloated blow-flies. Pretty much like the meat-and-no-potatoes folks. If it's only about weight (and merciful heavens, I hope it isn't), then amputation is a quick solution. But if it's about health, well didn't your grandmother ever teach you? Finish your vegetables, and don't play with dead things. If you insist on eating meat, doesn't moderation sound like a noble virtue?    In any case, and kidding aside, there's scarcely anything more emotional than food. It's our first comfort, when we come out of the womb. It's the melancholy, nostalgic feasts of childhood. It's courtship and conviviality. Great Scott, it gets a whole sense to itself! But when you concider the steep decadal rise in obesity and diabetes -- diabesity? -- and the failing fight against heart disease and cancer and the like, you know something is wrong. What's different? Is it oil prices? Is it ebola? Is it the Illuminati? Or is it what we're eating. The solution is certainly not fad diets, high-this and low-that. The word \\"diet\\" comes eventually from the Latin, meaning \\"a way of life,\\" or \\"lifestyle.\\" Hmm. Why, that's another hint! We should eat in a manner that we can sustain, and that can sustain us, for the rest of our lives.    The muffin vegetarians think their ethical purity will protect them. The cavemen think protein should be used as energy more than as building blocks. I suggest that we stop thinking of food in terms of a diet, and instead think of it as nutrition. It's not about how fat your hips or big your belly. It's about how healthy you can be. And like grandma used to say, \\"Moderation in most things.\\"
B0000CC5CS|3.0|While The Pentagon and American National Security are franticly trying to unravel the mysteries of an unknown computer virus that's shut down defense systems nation wide a motor home of salvation rolls across the desert in search of answers to the world's ultimate ethical dilemma... if reading this bores you don't buy the movie.     When The Terminator drives the two heroes through the desert to a church the thought that he is actually an angel of God (who  also rented this movie and wants his five bucks back) crosses my mind. Of course there's the inevitable brutal fight scene/wrestling match between SCHWARZENEGGER and the new bad guy/girl/android \\"T-X\\" a FREDRICKS OF HOLLYWOOD mannequin with no acting ability, super powers, nice T's and a decent A. Watching her get a super swirly almost makes me wish this movie had actually happened. Someone must stop Kristanna Loken before she acts again!    With any luck Arnold will run for President one day winning a decisive victory and saving everyone from the unthinkable fate of a TERMINATOR 4.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Friends, one of the greatest sitcoms in the history of television and one of the most loved. Today I picked up the last box set and am now the proud owner of The One With All Ten Seasons. From the very beginning of the show's remarkable ten year run, America and the rest of the world became somewhat attached to the lives of Rachel, Ross, Chandler, Phoebe, Monica and Joey. We gladly accepted them with open arms. What a breath of fresh air the show was thanks to the talented writers, producers, directors and a cast that will never be duplicated. Not even close. As I sat and watched the start of the tenth season(again), I thought to myself, no wonder this show lasted so long. The chemistry of these six fine actors who were virtually unknown when they started this show, became household names with good reason and the stories were so well written and real. We eventually felt as if they were are old friends that would always be there for us. They were for ten years. During the run of the show, we've all had our own ups and downs, our hopes and dreams ,and grew older and learned a lot about life just as our Friends did. Those of us who were in our 20's and 30's just like our Friends were, knew or got the jokes more than others may have... But they were there to let all the others understand what it meant to be a young adult trying to start your own life(in this crazy world) along with all those obstacles that get in the way again and again. The humor in Friends was that it was okay to laugh at your own mistakes. It was okay to laugh with your friends, not at them. The love and support these characters showed and had for each other, for those of us who watched, will always be embedded in our minds. We loved Friends and now with the tenth and final season in our homes, we know that we can laugh with our Friends when we need them. We know that they will be there for us, always...

I just dont like them this album out of all of them was definatly not my favorite and I would rather listen to the first album but they are just sloppy and borring.  It would maby be good If you were on pot or other drugs but i for one was not totaly blown away like others said they were.  I still dont get the whole stairway to heaven thing i think people just say they like it just to be cool but it is a really boring, long, repetative, overrated song and i just cant stand it.  Oh well my reveiw wont change anything that your thinking because you will get the album eventualy and either love it like most people or hate it like I did, so whatever.
B00005M91K|5.0|It's quite astounding how Baraka could convey such an emotional message without words. The director's choice of images underscored man's sinfulness, his need for redemption, and implicitly, his need for God's grace (and/or connection with a supreme being).<br /><br />The director's images are bleak; his outlook seems fatalistic in that he deliberately chose the broken, the down trodden, the poor, the bleary, war-torn landscapes. He could have just as easily chosen neutral or positive images: gardeners harvesting fruits and vegetables, people exploring mountain vistas on horseback, modest cities, towns, suburbs, railroads, bridges, et cetera. Instead, he chose to show people and animals scavenging through mountains of trash, mules pulling heavy loads and worked to the point of exhaustion, and dilapidated old shacks in which the extremely poor reside. This wasn't merely a cross-section of humanity -- it was a cross-section of the bleaker aspects of humanity.<br /><br />Even the neutral images of traffic and people -- sped up to several times their normal pace -- were shown as if to say \\"we're no different from the animals.\\" Images of baby chickens in a factory are toggled with images of commuters packed on subway cars and escalators. An arial view of people at a house of worship are shown as to resemble worker bees or ants scurrying about.<br /><br />One scene I felt was particularly effective was the way the director humanized the city. It was subtle, but the time-lapse shot of the city at night featured a soundtrack that resembled breathing! Yet the breath was mechanic, almost like an amalgamation of factory/machine sounds. This \\"lifeless breath\\" was perfectly in time with the traffic flow and it made for an interesting shot.<br /><br />I know I'm biased in this regard, but I felt the director was East-centric and didn't include enough scenes of Christianity. I don't recall seeing any Protestants, and don't remember seeing worshippers in church. The only time the director zoomed in on a depiction of Christ, the picture had what looked like paint spilled on it and it was in decay. Editorializing? Perhaps.<br /><br />Baraka is a worldwide story of redemption -- a store of people finding God. Baraka doesn't ask \\"how\\" as much as it asks \\"why\\". Baraka presents a voyeur version of religions -- you get to see what's going on, but the specific details don't really matter.<br /><br />In total, Baraka lays out for the viewer man's sinful nature, and presents religion as a way for man to reconnect with the divine.of Christ, the picture had what looked like paint spilled on it and it was in decay.

B000002H33|1.0|this is just sloppy messy misic and if you lke that kind of feeling when you think your cool and blast this loser CD and roll down your windows in your big truck.  this is just bad it makes me want to kill little bunnies and worrship statan.  The lyrics are dumb and sometimes dont make any sense and there.  There is some good guitar but hey its so much over rated.  This used to be one of my favorite but now I realize that they are just another 80s metal band nothing special.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This CD has been worth waiting for. If you are familiar with Madonna's repertoire, this is very reminiscent of her first album, which was chock full of dance club themed music. This is the same genre, just updated with 21st century beats. She speaks in the voice of someone who lives a club life, flirting, loving, dancing. It all gets swirled into a vortex of pulsating rhythms and danceable beats. The few slower songs that are more introspective, like Isaac, remind you of her Ray of Light days, but other that that, this CD (literally) never skips a beat. <br />For those who already know and love Madonna, this CD just reaffirms your feelings. For those who do not, this CD will make you realize why those of us who feel that way, do.  <br />I would highly recommend this for those who are NOT Madonna fans. This is the music she does best and nobody does it better. You will understand why \\"Madonna Music\\" is its own category. <br />You won't be disappointed!
B00000255F|2.0|If you are an old fart.  This guy is so over rated.  Maybe Im listening to a different thing but this guy's voice is horrible.  My dad is obsesed with him and has this album signed but who would want that.  This guy is a thing of a past and now He thinks he is such a big rebl because he hate pre. BUsh but this guy is a fake. He sucks at singing sucks at guitar and at drums.  His only talent which is why I gave it 2 stars is because of his lyrics but still this album is boring and just gets old after a while.  Im probabbly not going to change anyones mide into not buying this sobecause the media made this such a big hype but this is just not my kind of CD
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Bob Dylan is an amazing folk hero from New York and is widely considered a poetic genius who is constantly protesting society's labels and stereotypes. If you aren't yet a Dylan fan, then it's about time you watched this documentary by Martin Scorsese. This is an amazing film that follows Dylan's journey to becoming a folk singer and poet. <br /> <br />The internal story is not told directly in No Direction Home, but one that is shown by a powerful tableau of clips of events of his musical career that are told by Dylan and the people who knew him best. Dylan's simple philosophy is perfectly represented in this thought provoking two part documentary. Dylan is the embodiment of the complicated and skeptical thinking that we all have though few of us ever come to accept. <br /> <br />In the film we see Dylan question society, the media, and himself under the speculation of the public and his fans. He often refuses to do as the media would like and isn't affected musically by his fans or the press. Some of the most entertaining moments of this documentary are the atypical honest answers he gives in his interviews. <br /> <br />While some detractors may find Bob Dylan and this film boring and outdated, the real uniqueness of the documentary is the timeless story of a man's struggle to find fame as well as purpose. Dylan's genius is complemented by Scorsese's brilliance in this amazing film that is engraved with excellence and I highly recommend.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|For all those who like their music to be Dance and not Madonna's version should definitely grab a disc from Kylie Minogue..This is nothing more than a sad attempt at stealing Kylie's style and it fails on every Level..The good song is Hung Up..That is It..and only b/c of the AbbA Sample that she steals.....Mariah carey's Fantasy was a good use of a sample..this is just plain Stealing.

B0009HLDFU|1.0|I won't repeat the horror stories of those who've tried to copy the songs onto an MP3 etc.  The real fun began when I disgustedly took the CD back to \\"A MAJOR RETAILER\\" with lots of stores all over the US to return it.  \\"Sorry, we don't accept music returns\\".  Why?  \\"Because you may have copied the songs.\\"  I politely pointed out to a manager that the CD is copy-protected so they can't fall back on that excuse.  I then told him exactly how much money I and my family have spent at his big blue-tag store in the last 12 months and I assured him I would never, ever buy so much as a stick of gum at this chain from now on.  THEY TOOK THE DOUBLE CD BACK and gave me a full refund. <br /> <br />Moral of the story, take your copy-protected big corporate DRM drink-coasters back to the store and demand your money back.
B000BKDOB6|5.0|Rolling Stone Magazine named \\"Horses\\" one of the top 50 rock albums of all time. You will understand why when you listen to this beautifully remastered 30th annivery CD. Patti Smith mixes poetry, parts of iconic rock and roll songs, double track lyrics and strong narratives always with a fine basic rock beat that draws you in if you get confused (the lyrics are also included in a booklet). <br /> <br />The real jem here is the live CD that expands on each song, especially \\"Land,\\" my favorite. Thirty years later Patti is as sassy and spell binding as ever. I saw Patti Smith four times in person during the 1970s, but never heard her sing \\"Land.\\" The live version of the song runs about 17 minutes and is worth the wait. Patti has added a brief prologue and additional lyrics that  explain the meaning of the song more (and bashes cell phones and other distractions). I still don't comletely understand the song, but this version rocks so hard that it makes little difference. Others like the song \\"Birdland\\" better; this live concert has an excellent version of that song also. As with all good live albums, the music sounds better the louder you play it. <br /> <br />Other commnents: the remastered CD sounds great with high price earphone, the live CD less good. The price is too high, so high <br />that it will probably discourage all but hard core fans from buying this 30th Anniversery package.
5550155184|5.0|I haven't read such a good book in a long while. I love \\"detective\\" / puzzle / mystery type of novels (Sherlock Holmes, Christie, Elizabeth George, Forsyth, le Carre ...), and this book has all these plus more. Without placing much of a spoiler, I'll try to let non-readers know why ...<br />1) Brown's book is very tightly woven - he had a lot of \\"clues\\" upfront, there are no loose strings. Compared to George's thick tome with a lot of fluff and heart-rendering fillers, \\"Da Vinci Code\\" was fast paced.<br />2) One needn't understand \\"artsy\\" stuff to enjoy this book. Brown explained it succinctly, yet enough for general readers to follow the story.<br />3) A powerful message within, makes one wants to think about ... life, the universe etc<br />4) After one finished reading, one could go back re-reading immediately without feeling bored -- there's so much discovery along the way.<br />5) Although I had visited Louvre 10+ years ago, it makes me want to re-visit, to \\"prove\\" the \\"facts\\" of his fiction. There are commentaries that this work is fiction, though Brown had a disclaimer at the front to say all descriptions of art are accurate ...

Let's all just \\"Get Together\\" and purchase the album NOW and continue to post positive reviews. You won't be \\"Sorry\\"! With tracks like \\"Future Lovers\\" and \\"I Love New York\\", you will not miss a beat! Blast those LOUD!  Just \\"Let It (Will) Be\\"! Buy it now, buy it for a \\"Forbidden Love\\" possibly? When you hear this album ,you will literally \\"Jump\\"!- \\"How High\\"- I'm not sure but I am sure \\"Isaac\\" will sound familiar to you as it extends the mmmmm's in Frozen! Apologies if I am trying to \\"Push\\" this album on you, but \\"Like It Or Not\\" when you buy it, amazement sets in and know that you are adding sales to Madonna's numbers to go to number one on Billboard! Madonna rules in 2005/2006!
B000B8QEZG|3.0|madonna is one of the biggest marketing success cases that entartainment scene ever saw. she always follows \\"what's next\\", and while some unnamed people already doing it, she packages it so jazzed up and sells. yes, the best thing she does is selling -before singing and making music-. <br /> <br />this is and OK, a little over-average dance CD. \\"Hung Up\\" is obviously the best cut (mostly with the help of Abba's sampled loop), and the only one you can listen to repeatedly. this is not a CD you may put on and repeat more than 2 times cuz it gets boring after the first listen. this is a CD you keep on your shelf, and play when you really wanna dance (why aren't you going to a club is not my business) or you invited some gay friends and want to keep them happy. <br /> <br />comparisons to \\"ray of light\\" is a big insult to that album, because ROL was really a great musical masterpiece which I highly doubt madge will ever catch that point again. <br /> <br />this is not a bad album, nor a great one. only no one would notice these songs if they were not branded my \\"madonna\\".

B000B8QEZG|2.0|Let's be honest here. Madonna has NEVER been considered a brilliant vocalist. But the thing is no one really cared. Her crazy antics, original look and carefree spirit had us all overlooking her blatant lack of vocal talent. She made her mark in the 80's with a unique look and pop-tart sweet confections such as \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Material Girl\\". Once the \\"Virgin\\" shtick wore off, it was time to move on to the next phase, \\"Dita\\" the dominatrix. She promised she would teach us all a sexual thing or two via \\"Erotica\\". A coffee table book meant to shock us barely made a ripple in the ocean. Next, it was time to grow up and become a SERIOUS \\"artist\\". Evita was her chance and although marginal success followed, her next several movie roles proved Madge couldn't sing OR act (Swept Away anyone?).  The mid to late 90's found our material girl/mom stretching out to new horizons and the phenomenal \\"Ray Of Light\\" was, is, and always will be the jewel in Madonna's musical crown. Having now secured a legitimate \\"voice\\" in the musical community thanks to a handful of Grammy's, our favorite quick change artist used her next two CD's as a platform to speak her mind. \\"Music\\" had marginal success (by Madonna standards), and I wont even bring up \\"American Life\\".  Now, after realizing no one wanted to hear what she really thougth, Brit-Madge decided to go back to where she once came and resurrect the pop-confection machine from which she now lives the uber posh (and British) lifestyle she and her family enjoy. Problem is, Madonna isn't 24 anymore. The carefree and daring antics that made us all love/hate her are gone. She has grown up and her view on the world is not the same as it was in 1985. Back then, men were toys, toys were disposable, money was her idol, and God was both her greatest love and enemy. She pushed our buttons and we jumped...to the record store to gobble up all we could.  But now, Madonna is 47 years old. She has two children, both of whom are not allowed to watchTV, listen to radio, or read anything in print that may show them what their mom did to get them that big house in the British countryside. Her days are now spent reading stories to her kids (most of which she penned I assume), hanging out in pubs with her husband and studying the Kabballah. She doesn't live the pop life anymore. She no longer has to struggle to survive. She hasn't eaten a meal from a garbage can in many, many years. These experiences are the backbone for creativity. TRUE creativity from which most musical genius is born. Instead, she jets around the world to glamorous affairs dressed head to toe in the designer du jour. Faithfully reproducing what we consider to be a \\"Star\\". But when the camera bulbs stop flashing and the crowds cheer dims, she is mom, wife, and most importantly, BUSINESS WOMAN.  Which brings me to my final point and review of this train wreck of a CD. Madonna is who/where she is because she knows business. She knows how to package herself and sell it. She WAS the Material Girl. She was DITA, the dominatrix. She WAS Eva Peron in Evita. but unfortunately, she isn't the pop princess she once was and this album proves it. The Material girl would DIE before uttering the word \\"Dork\\". The \\"Virgin\\" would scoff at sampling someone else's music to use for her own (ABBA) and \\"Eva\\" would have given her country before allowing her music to be used as a RING TONE!  It seems to me that Madonna is pumping a dry well. Her creativity (or lack thereof) on this album proves that. Silly lyrics, inane choruses and a general blandness plague this entire set. Her maturity and life experience actually work against her. This is supposed to be a \\"Dance\\" record. Carefree, spirited, and hip was the goal, forced, dumbed-down, and outright silly was the result. Which is tragic to both listen to, and to watch as my life long idol continues towards a sad end to a once fun, outrageous, and ground breaking career crafted by the most successful business woman of ourtime.
B000063WDH|4.0|The Black Keys are my favorite band that is still together and making new albums regularly.  One of my good friends turned me on to them when we were recommending music to each other.  I recommended Ten Years After, and he told me to check out the black keys.  Thanks John! <br /> <br />These guys from Akron (just a quick jog from here in Cleveland) are adding to the blues.  The people that say they rip off the classic blues guys are dead wrong.  The Black Keys don't try to be Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson or even groups like Cream.  They are playing their own blues.  All of their songs are fresh, interesting and exciting.  Don't take my 4 stars as a slight, I just reserve the ranking of 5 for the best of the best. <br /> <br />The only thing I have against this disc is the 20 odd minutes of silence after the last track, which artifically increases the official album length.  It's not a big deal though, overall a great album.
B000001IQH|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs ever. this is just great ever song is just so good.  Mexwell murder is my favorite because of the sweet bass solo.  Tim and lars vocals work great together. The best of punk.  Great CD rancids best. Nothing much to say except that it is great and sounds like the first clash CD awsome. Them and Green Day (old Greenday Post Warniing) Punk 90s revival great. Get the offspring too smash great CD as well.
0553801503|4.0|The Mr. Martin hooked his devoted readers in so tight with his first 3 books, that anything he writes returning us to this world is well worth reading and very engaging. Its the great detail about seemingly little story development that in fact is welcome in that by slowing down the story it lasts a lot longer. Too often a book or series moves so fast that its over and done with.  The human, emotional and psychological elements in this latest book are quite engaging and I enjoyed Brienne's psychological trials and tribulations immensely.    <br /> <br />In my view, the one drawback to the excessively long intervals between books is that due to the immense detaill and complex geneology one tends to get confused with some of the character connections.    <br /> <br />If this is a book split in 2, it is Mr. Martins responsibility to get his next book out with a year which is entirely reasonable for any focused author.  That or he better check himself into a hospital for a complete medical examination to ensure he will survive the excessive years it takes him to organize and write his books.
B000000OQF|1.0|wow how could they ever become popular.  Oh i know why it is because of slash. now i must admit he is a great guitar player but i just dont get axl rose wath a bum.  his voice is almost worse that the blink 182 singer (almost). But seriosly has any body been listening to the same album i am i mean if it is i dont know what youre problem.  I know the problem is that half of the people who reviewd this album havent even heard them.  they just want to be cool so they go get the t-shirts from myrvens and pretend to like them so they can fit id.  The other half are deaf, or have never heard real talent. over all dont get this album if you dont like a screechy voice that breaks glass blasted in your ear dont get it.
B00004CWO8|5.0|I saw Swan Lake my first time at City Center in New York, the Balanchine production of the 1950s.  I was awed, captivated, swept away.  I was about 6 years old.  I've seen many productions since, and they've often felt like museum pieces, stiff and starchy despite the best dancing. They haven't felt new or vital. This production left me gaping in wonder, even though the choreography wasn't always brilliant.  In fact, it was sometimes awkward and jarring, and that's a good thing. The music, the dazzling, shimmering, lustrous music, stood out in all its genius because the dancing made you listen as opposed to tapping your fingers one-two-three one-two-three.  There's nothing automatic or received here. <br /> <br />Then there's the dark psychological story line of repression battling psychic freedom, a story that doesn't always have a happy ending despite American expectations. I loved the male swans, especially Adam Cooper who was sensuous, powerful, hypnotic.  Have you ever been chased by a swan?  They are huge beasts, not merely lovely gliding figures on a lake or river.  This production captures them in all their danger and even ferocity, while offering a 50s version of a royal family too much in the public's eye.  This may not be the tidiest Swan Lake I've ever seen, but it's the most alive. <br /> <br />Terrific sets and costumes rounded out performance and an interpretation that left me tearful and stunned.  This is no war horse, it's a race horse.  And one more delightful note.  People here have complained about the cameras not always focusing on the dancing, the feet--but what that does is replicate one's experience in the balcony with opera glasses, watching feet, faces, hands, shifting to try to take it all in.
B00008OLIO|1.0|All you guys are bums I just cant beveive what you guys are saying these guys are good, they are the worst band i have ver heard who ever just put 5 stars you are a loser and dont know what music is this hair band are the biggest joke in music history and they just plain suck.

B000B8QEZG|2.0|\\"I want to sound like Goldfrapp or else!\\"<br /><br />\\"But Madonna, we can't do that! It would look like plagiarism...\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't care! Make me sound like Alison Goldfrapp. I heard her albums and that's what I want to sound like, damn it!\\"<br /><br />\\"But Maddy, she's a Brit and pretty popular with clubbers there, don't you want to be original?\\"<br /><br />\\"That's Ms Madonna to you, buster! And no, I don't care about originality. You're starting to piss me off - just like those damned British workmen who came to my house and wouldn't take orders. Don't make me angry!

I just wanted to point out that it might be a little bit blatant if you copy this British woman too closely. You pay me for my opinions...\\"<br /><br />\\"Just shut up and start making the arrangements, okay?!\\"<br /><br />Well, the CD sounds like a poor-man's version or a Goldfrapp album or should that be a slightly-less-than-poor ageing \\"material girl's\\" version of a Goldfrapp album?<br /><br />Madonna is really a little too old for this sort of thing. The \\"eff off\\" in one of the songs was the album's most tedious and tawdry moment.
B000BO0LLS|4.0|There are a few reasons the album is good:  1) We Belong Together - the singles manage to re-establish an old style with new touches .  a) It marks the potential comeback of \\"Quiet Storm\\" and \\"Slow Jams\\" musical styles with good beats and modern mixing.  b) The remix version becomes a great hip-hop hit!  c) Lyrics reflect three segments of human emotions.    2) New way of singing for Mariah - instead of totally capitalising on the \\"melisma\\" approach (which is highly evident in her past hits), she is grouping several words into single musical notes in order to sound \\"fast\\".    3) 70s Soul with Modern and Unique Touches - 70s Soul sung using Power Ballad approach, tinges of singing in whistle register, along with good beats.    4) Experimental Songs - \\"Stay The Night\\" has a certain \\"jazz\\" feel. \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is a unique gospel song with good production work.    5) Good arrangement of music styles within the territory of Soul - Club, Quiet Storm, Power Ballad (with Soul touches), RnB, Gospel, Jazz (with Soul touches), New Jack Swing (RnB with Hip-Hop / Rap touches) , Slow Jams, Diana-Ross style (evident in \\"I Wish You Knew\\")    Packaging:  1) Dress - Roman-inspired (Stola) with sexual allure. High-class + Club-feel  2) Cover - Possibly inspired by the covers of \\"Daydream\\" + \\"Butterfly\\" + \\"Rainbow\\"  3) Concept - The design on the cover in tandem with the way the album was named reflects a certain \\"Roman\\" style. Roman style is known for its bold yet beautiful designs. Such style is applicable to the vocal and musical prowess shown in this album.    I personally feels that this album reaffirms her status as Queen of RnB.    Wondering when she will be singing \\"Disco\\". She sounded good in VH1 Divas Live singing a disco-house-remix version of \\"Heartbreaker\\" + Diana Ross's \\"Love Hangover\\"
B00005JO17|2.0|My husband and I took our two children, 3 and 5, to see this film. We were all disappointed.  My husband joked that the best part of the film is that it was only 70 minutes!!!  The children, who are usually enraptured in Disney movies, could not have been any less interested.  In the way of the Shreck films, the movie humor was geared towards adults... not that we found it in the least bit funny. <br />Forty dollars later, we found ourselves asking why did we bother?  The best part of the outing was getting to spend time with our children.  Save your money and find another way to spend your valuable family time.  This film is a waste of time.
0307277674|1.0|I have read your writing, DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons, and I wish to put forth my two cents. I realize that you, even if you do see this \\"letter\\" on MySpace, will shrug it off like many of the others that give your book a one star rating...that you will label me just another \\"fundamentalist Christian\\" while rolling your eyes. You have your freedom to do such, just as I have my freedom to examine and say why I disagree with your works. As a writer, these two books are in themselves poorly written because, for the very sake of space, they follow the same scenario, the same plot...different places same storyline, same \\"plot turns,\\" same \\"actions and reactions.\\" There really were no surprises between one book and the next, and I am quite certain that the next book in this \\"series\\" of slandering God, we'll again see the same plot and character development already seen in your works. Now really, please, if you call yourself a writer stop using the same exact style of chapter to chapter plot devices, branch outward. You are just as bad as some of the horror writers and romance writers that we see out there today...a sad fact that scars the beauty of the printing press.<br /><br />Now that I have that out of the way, speaking the plan truth toward your writing, I want to say something about the liberalized theology you've placed in your works...liberalized theology that you say speaks true and makes your books (or so you say) truthful. I understand completely why you say you believe in such a way. I have read your works, your reasons, and I have also read the dubious source materials that you say back up what you wish to explore in your books. Gnosticism and liberalized Christianity/Jesus Seminar style of beliefs. As a seminary student myself, I have been exposed to such writings and I really have to say that the \\"evidence\\" is about as heavy as a helium balloon in a hurricane. What you say is evidence holds no truth, no concrete foundation...and it isn't just bad history, but it is bad theology...still, in this day and age when and where traditional Christianity is hit at by Christianphobics such as yourself, John Sponge, Marcus Borg, Elaine Pagels, and the other of that kin.<br /><br />Your type goes from one end of the \\"new age\\"/\\"historical\\" spectrum to the other-from saying as you say, that Jesus was a goddess worshiper and that he had children with Mary Magdalene to saying those who say that Jesus did not really \\"die\\" on the cross but (as some \\"historians\\" have said) gone to Asia to learn the way of \\"enlightenment.\\" These tales have been told by gnostic and occult writers for many ages...and they have about as much evidence supporting them as you say you have to support you and your beliefs you speak out in your books. None. Still, you think that your evidence is groundbreaking and unique, it isn't. All the evils you speak of as truths in your book have been shown throughout history. Of course, the devil does love a good marketer. Again, such people as yourself tries to, and thinks they, are speaking something new, something different, something \\"passionately powerful and eye opening.\\" You are not. Neither are the others like Pagels and Sponge. All of you are following the same pitiful and pitying belief that so many others in history has followed. I know you wont believe me when I say this: you are wrong and the Bible says you are wrong. I will only say that if you look hard enough, looked passionately enough like I myself have looked before coming back to Christ Jesus, you would see that the Bible is the truth...and not only that, Jesus Christ, the real historical Jesus Christ, is the exact same Jesus Christ that we read in the Bible. Alas, you do have the right to have your speech free, and you have the right to speak your mind, and that I applaud in this free society we have (built upon Christian ethics that you try to break down, ironically)...still...your views and your thoughts are to be pitied.<br /><br />And that isthe crux of the matter that I hold against your book. People have been slandering Jesus Christ for ages, since his virgin birth, death, and resurrection. And while I hate to say the devil is behind this corner, plainly so he is, in this instance. But about you. For you I can only say is that I feel sorry for you. I pity you. You are a blind man being lead by blinding falseness. You are someone I pity because I know that you are wrong. The Bible says you are wrong. And just as the Bible says you are wrong, it also say that you will be brought before the Lord Jesus one of these days and you will be made accountable for your actions and your writings and your deeds. You don't believe this, but I do, and I trust the Bible as the seminary student that I am. I trust the Bible not on my own well wishes, but on empirical life changing truths that radiate from the Bible. Again, you and most of those sad sad folks who give you four or five stars and are raving fans of yours, will not believe me...but just as I feel sorry for you, I also feel sorry for the lost and blind disciples you have created with your works. I feel sad because I know that you and they, as I said before, will face the King of Kings and you will be held accountable for all that has been done in your name.<br /><br />In the end you are a sad sad man and I feel sorry for you. You may have the riches of the world, you may, as the many people who keep giving you thumbs up, have the world at your finger tips. But in the end. In the end. By not having the truth of Christ in your heart, and the cleaning that only He can give, you will only have darkness. Darkness for eternity. I feel sorry for you Mr. Dan Brown. You are a very pitiful man. Maybe you will change.  Maybe you will come back to the truth, to the One Jesus Christ who died for your sins and the sins of the world, maybe you will come back and realize the evils you have acted upon and thus change your ways so that you will live your life for the Lord.  Then again, maybe you wont.that is the crux of the matter that I hold against your book. People have been slandering Jesus Christ for ages, since his virgin birth, death, and resurrection.

B000000WA4|5.0|Its amazing what most people say when they review this album, or even speak of it in general conversation.  Most people will highlight songs such as \\"Bullit with Butterfly Wings\\", \\"Zero\\", \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" and \\"1979\\" as the only great points of the album and speak ill of such songs as \\"XYU\\", \\"They Only Come Out Night\\" and \\"Cupid de Locke\\".  Its really no surprise considering the calibre of music that's shoveled down your throat by MTV and radio these days.  Of course most people will speak highly of the first list of songs above simply because they were drilled home as singles and loved for primarily that reason alone.  The same could be said about \\"Today\\", \\"Rocket\\" and \\"Disarm\\" from Siamese Dream; none of which were above average for that album, but memorable to the masses because of their abundance of radio play. <br /> <br />To further prove my point, most people who only like the singles will also probably never mention one word about Pisces Escariot--which was the first follow-up to Siamese Dream, not Mellon Collie, which followed over a year later--or may have never even heard of it.  This album (to my knowledge) never produced one single on the radio or MTV, but was fantastic from beginning to end.  Yet it will never get the recognition it deserves from mainstream audiences and I see the same for Mellon Collie. <br /> <br />The point of all this is simple.  If you are not a musician or one who appreciates true music, the album probably can't keep a hold on your attention-span very long.  If the singles do it for you, enjoy them.  However, those that fall into the above two categories will be those who can also appreciate similar material by the Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Who and many other rock bands that made a major impact on music and will remain timeless so long as human society stands.  The latter tracks mentioned above are not filler, they are songs in their own right--short, to the point and fitting perfectly within the space alloted them and are integral to producing a feel and completion that could not be presented without them. <br /> <br />Short does not mean \\"filler\\" and long does not mean \\"boring\\" even though most modern music will lead you to believe.  Give me this album (or any other Smashing Pumpkins album, sans Adore) any day over Linkin Park, Disturbed or the rest of the mindless, talentless and uninspired noise that comprises the majority of air-time these days--all their ilk will always eventually find their place in rock history:  the trash can.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|I must preface the review by stating I am no bleeding heart romantic. I am no fan of Morissey for instance. Drowning in misery as a career does not interest me.  <br /> <br /> That said, I am completely enamoured with this release by James Blunt. I was immediately drawn in by his vocals and the wonderful yet not over produced arrangements of the album. Others have written about how the album covers heart rending topics such as unrequited love but the subtly of the way he crafts an image is so vivid as to remind one of a painting.  <br /> <br /> When I introduced the album to my wife she insisted we listen to it twice. That never happens. As I watched her listen to the tracks it was obvious she had a very emotional response to the album too.  <br /> <br /> A fine debut and I truly look forward to hearing more from this most talented man.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|...Which is a miracle in this era of absolute R&B/ Hip Hop dominance in the U.S.  Hung Up debuted #20,went down 1 notch after that, and seemed doomed when in its third week went to #27 in Billboard's Hot 100; but now it seems back in business,jumping to # 14!  It is cute that a 47 year old woman with a dance-pop song gets to be in the U.S. top 20: If you check out the U.S. top songs, number ones are privileges overextended to months for the Ushers, Mariahs, and Fifties ( Kanye's Golddigger is an actually deserving 2-month-number-1 genius track); the close-mindedness of U.S. radio dj's is unbelievable,and that is what keeps away from the U.S. charts fantastic acts like Franz Ferdinand or Chemical Brothers, and even world-wide successful pop acts like Tatu or Robbie Williams.  But I digress, Madonna is in heaven right now,I applaud the fact that she sneaked into Billboard's top 20 with a totally distinctive song, and I hope Confessions will keep fans and non-fans paying attention throughout 2005-2006...  Great record Madonna,you  show us that there is plenty of life at 47!

055380457X|2.0|I'm fascinated by Google and closely monitor the various techno-goodies that it puts out for its loyal following.  So naturally, I snapped up a copy of this at Borders.  But I really found myself put off by Vise's adulation for Brin and Page.  Maybe Vise really feels that way, but it made me almost wonder if Vise is planning to apply for a job in Google's public affairs department. <br /> <br />Seriously, Google's rise to being the titan of search is well-worth being chronicled in a book or two.  But I just don't think that Vise's book is terribly objective.  The book would have had more credibility if it mentioned some of Google's warts (and those of its founders).  Instead, Brin and Page come across as a couple of demigods, and something tells me that that is not true.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Well, i have had this album for quite a while now and i must say, it is prolly the best cd i have ever heard and im gonna review it song by song here we go:      1.

Burn it down: Oh what an intro, prolly the best on the album, love the dual guitar which is in every song , but most good in this one. Great solo, Love the vocals right before an after the solo. 10/10                      3. Blinded in chains : Well if any song competes with burn it down for best intro, it is this. Quite possibly the best drum track on the album and it show around the 2:30 mark with a lightning fast double bass solo. great song.9.5/10          4. Bat coutry: the first single off the record and a damn good one too. This used to be my favorite song on here , but it is extremely overplayed on radio and tv . Very catchy , very good solo and if u dont like the vocals , u should cause they r good.10/10              5. Trashed and Scattered: Not my favorite on the album but still great nonetheless.

Johnny Christ( bass ) shines. Unreal bass at the beginning. That goes into an epic song that just sounds epic. Another great one i think talkin about the end of the world. 9/10.           9. Strength of the world : A long intro with  an orchestra , but when it gets into the chorus, it kicks your A**. I love the solo in this song and everything leading up to it. At the end when he says \\" i miss my family, i'll never be alright.\\" That lets you know how epic this song is. 9.5/10                 10. Betrayed : Tribute to the late great \\" DImebag Darrell, and a mighty good one. Love the vocals, especially the chorus where he says \\" passion in my eyes , i lived it everyday.\\" Just amazing vocals, amazing everything else too. the Rev ( Drums ) shows his talent in this one. Great song. 11/10.               11. M.I.A : my favorite song on the album , great little intro with fast paced drumming and sweet double bass action. Gah i love the lyrics in this. \\" So many soldiers on the other side, I take their lives so they can't take mine \\" , and \\" Some are scared others killing for fun , I shot a father right in front of a son, take away my consciousness and please erase my dreams \\" . Wow, that is amazing, Love it. 50/10.      Overall, i give this a 12/10 cause its the best cd i have ever lisened to, and if you think they have sold out listne to the epic guitar solos a few times and come talk to me.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|As a long time Depeche Mode fan, I say this album is classic Depeche Mode.  I listen to it and I hear a guitar riff from Songs of Faith and Devotion, a vocal from Violator or Ultra, a beat from Exciter, etc, etc.  The first time I listened to it was while lying in bed with the lights off.  Even though I was quite tired, I just had to hear the entire album.  I was drawn into the lush soundscape filled with rhythmic beats, sparse guitars, a few orchestral movements and beautiful vocals.  Even though there are other track by track reviews here, I feel the need to put in my 2 cents... <br /> <br />1.  A pain that I'm used to...a grinding guitar intro that slides into a smooth pop song.  I always love the simple clean guitar sound that DM often utilizes and does use during the verses of this song.  The grinding guitar sounds a bit like an air raid siren and I suppose that is \\"the pain that I'm used to\\" as it tends to hurt my ears!  It is a direct contrast to the rest of the song. <br /> <br />2.  John the revelator...I agree this song would fit perfect on Songs of Faith and Devotion.  A heavier, crunchier track that is more aggressive than all the others. <br /> <br />3.  Suffer well...A sweeping pop song with a brisk pace.  Whomever said this is like \\"Behind the Wheel\\" was right on, but I also hear a bit of \\"Question of Time\\". <br /> <br />4.  The sinner in me...A slow driving beat and darker, sad vocals make this song an interesting look at taming our inner sinner. <br /> <br />5.  Precious...An achingly beautiful song with an outstanding vocal, and again, the simple clean guitar and tingly keyboards that give me a shiver each time I hear the song.  The underlying beat is the perfect rhythm for the song.  The vocal reminds me a bit of \\"Waiting for the Night\\" or \\"Only When I Lose Myself\\" as the way David Gahan sings it sounds as thought his heart were breaking. <br /> <br />6.  Macro...Martin Gore's first lead vocal of the album.  Not my favorite of the album, but not abad track.  I really enjoy the \\"sound\\" of the track (slow to mid tempo beat with those clean and simple guitars), but am not sure if I like the lyrics just yet. <br /> <br />7.  I want it all...Another wonderful vocal.  The sound of David Gahan's vocal is so palpable that you almost feel like you could reach out and touch him.  I also love when David Gahan and Martin Gore harmonize as they do here.  The beat has a more industrial sound, but it is not harsh.  It is a slow march over which floats an ethereal melody. <br /> <br />8.  Nothing's impossible...A somewhat monotone delivery gives this song an odd tone, but I love that guitar sound.  This is a great love song and is full of hope for a second chance.  The monotone voice gives a feeling almost of lament and pining and waiting for any little reason, any little way for him to show that he can change and make things work.  <br /> <br />\\"Just give me a reason/Some kind of sign/I'll need a miracle to help me this time/I've heard what you said and I feel the same/I know in my heart I'll have to change/Even the stars look brighter tonight/Nothing's Impossible/I still believe in love at first at first sight/Nothing's Impossible\\".   <br /> <br />I really like this track! <br /> <br />9.  Damaged people...A short slow instrumental that is all about mood and feeling.  I find it a relaxing piece that is a perfect lead in to the next track. <br /> <br />10.  Intro spectre...A Martin Gore sung ballad a la \\"Question of Lust\\", but not as heartfelt. <br /> <br />11.  Lilian...A song with dark lyrics paired with an upbeat tempo and distorted guitars.  David Gahan sounds a bit nasal, as if singing with great contempt for \\"Lilian\\". <br /> <br />12.  The darkest star...A slow song that just passes over like a wave.  A good closing track. <br /> <br />I really enjoy listening to this album and believe that it is a great addition to their body of work.
B000068FWC|5.0|Anyone with any Classic Rock sensibilities should surely already have this CD/Album in their collection.  Like many others I've spent many hours listening to the vinyl copy only to augment it with the CD years later.  Not every vinyl album I've had has been replaced this way but this was an obvious exception along with other classic Albums like `Dark Side of the Moon'.  Supertramp hit a strange nerve with this recording back in 1979 & in retrospect it seems strange that it did so very well on both sides of the Atlantic (or is that the Pacific - I forget!).  Punk was obviously waning after the self-destruction of the Sex Pistols and a new era of post-punk artistic sensibilities were storming the airways whilst every-one was waiting to see what big new direction music would take.  The Classic Rock bands of the 70's seemed to be on hold & this was probably one of the last hurrahs for one of true Supergroups of the 70's before the horror of some of the more popular New Wave acts appeared in the early 80's.  Certainly the pinnacle of Supertramps career this soft-rock gem contains some of their very best work (well obviously!)  `The Logical Song', `Goodbye Stranger', `Breakfast in America' & `Take the Long way Home' should be familiar to anyone who had a post-teenage pulse in the late 70's early 80's.  Always great musicians `Supertramp's' lyrical mastery & melodic sensibilities were in crackling good form here hardly putting a foot wrong.  The four aforementioned tracks alone should be reason enough to own this CD & if you don't already have this in your collection I suggest you reacquaint yourself with one of the top 10 albums of the 70's.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears has some really great songs. That is something most people can't deny. Though she doesn't have the strongest of voices, it doesn't stop her from making some really kick a** music. Her voice becomes secondary to her great production team and her strong confidence. Think of her as the new Madonna or Janet (neither of which are really breaking records anymore.) Britney's third album was vital to her growth and maturity in her music. With her third album she had to decide whether to give her fans the same bubble-gum pop and risk boring them or she could mature and get edgier. Thank goodness she chose a path that would appeal both sides. Half of this album keeps up with Britneys safe dance pop while the other half flirts with dangerous sexy R&B. The sexier songs are what really show how she is so much more than a pop clone. She can mature into an artist of R&B after the bubble-gum pop dies. The album goes from R&B to pop to R&B again. That back and forth really make the album flow and show Brits transition into a woman. I recommend this album becuase it offers great pop songs as well as great R&B songs. A truly wonderful album.  BRITNEY SPEARS ~ BRITNEY  1. I'm A Slave 4 U - Britneys first single of the album that ozzed with sexuality and was her first R&B sexed up release. Along with a sexy video, this song slithers and pants up a very sexy tune that is really fantastic. 10/10  2. Overprotected - The remix is stronger but the song is still great in its original version. Good pop song. 9/10  3. Lonely - This is a wonderful R&B song and should have been a single. A very sexy yet angry song.I always love the songs Britney writes herself. She should do it more. I love this track. 10/10  4. I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman - A cute pop Britney ballad. Her voice songs pretty good and its a very pretty song.Its a powerful Britney ballad nonetheless. Dido co-wrote it. 10/10  5. Boys - Once again the remix is stronger but this is more Britney and less Pharrel. A good R&B-ish pop song. Britney is sexy again, and I can't get enough. 9/10  6. Anticipating - A little too poppy but it is really fun anyway. One of those songs that are fun to listen to in the car on a sunny day. One of those uplifting pop songs. 9/10  7. I Love ROck N'Roll - A good Britney cover of a Joan Jett song. Though its a little too poppy for such a classic rock song it kinda works. Her version of the Rolling Stone's \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" was better but this is a good track nonetheless. 8/10  8. Cinderella - A really good pop song. Britney really rocks out. Another Britney penned hit. 10/10  9. Let Me Be - Not the strongest on the album but a decent pop song. The chorus is pretty cool. 7/10  10. Bombastic Love - A pretty good song, Britney sings it well. Kind of haunting and yet poppy at the same time...decent. 7/10  11. That's Where You take Me - A sweet dance song along the lines of \\"Anticipating\\" but not quite as strong. 6/10  12. What It's Like To Be Me - A Justin Timberlake co-written song this is a really great song. Its a bit on the short side but Britney really makes it her won, even though Justin had to stick his lame beat boxing its Britney that makes it all work.10/10    This album is very low on filler unlike most pop albums of the time. Most songs bring something good to the table. Hopefully Britney bounces back from her recent trailer trash phase, ditches Kevin, and becomes the coolest pop star again. We are missing her in music today. GO BRITNEY!!! BRITNEY ROCKS MY SOCKS!!!
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Don't Forget About Us and Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do) are probably available for a digital download but I wantted to buy the re-release so I can have all songs non-stop - together.  These two out of four new songs featured on this CD are worth a lot!  I love them! <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|What a beautiful trippy melodic passionate album. I think this is one of the best albums ever. I dont want to pigeon hole them by saying they sound like so & so. They have their own very unique sound. I absolutely love it. One of the best albums of the 90's
1591396190|4.0|To be honest, I got strong prejudice against this book before reading it. The book title \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" carried so strong a sense of gimmick to me. After reading it, I must confess that it is much better than what I expected, and the blue ocean metaphor (vs red ocean) becomes more acceptable.<br /><br />The centre of gravity of this book is at Chapter Two, where the authors brought forward two very useful analytical tools and frameworks: The Strategy Canvas and The Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create Grid. The rest of it were elaboration of the criteria for a good blue ocean strategy (focus, divergence and a compelling tagline) with samples (case studies + Strategy Canvas) and action paths. I dont want you to get the very wrong impression that I am a plagarist so I strongly recommend you to read the review by Doug Laplante who got very similar thoughts/doubts as mine. So bad that Doug Laplante had written only one review so far.<br /><br />Anyway, this book worths your valuable time and its price. A good investment for business book collection, for sure.
B000A5044C|3.0|This is a good film, but it is not going to be for everybody.  It is a very sad tale, poignant and somber.  The acting is superb as the story slowly and meticulously unfolds.  That said, this film is not for the impatient, as is the tradition of modern Japanese film the story is protracted and heavy, virtually forcing the viewer to become invested in the characters and to feel the weight of their moral burdens.  The critical themes that emerge are unquestioning love, selflessness, selfishness, and social responsibility.  In short, a young boy is left to care for his siblings when his mother abandons them.  It is a story filled with images of daily life in modern Japan, the setting for a heart wrenching story of the hope and the promise that a child can find anywhere.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of modern Japanese cinema, then this film is probably not for you.  In other words, if you are looking for something to experiment with, do not purchase this.  This is for those who like Japanese film and understand a bit about Japanese culture and enjoy the exploration of these virtures...that one does not show emotion, one does not show tears, one does not reveal to the world their inner fears, thoughts or desires.  If this is your cup of tea then it will be particularly moving to see such themes so convincingly acted by mere children.  For me, that was the essence of this film and is a very real portrayal of the skills needed to survive in Japanese culture, the pride of a young boy to care for his siblings even to the end of honoring his promises.<br /><br />If you happen to have already seen this film and loved it, or would like an additional recommendation, check out \\"Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World (2004)\\" a film that won 6 awards (including 3 Japanese Academy Awards) and was nominated for 7 others.
B00005ASIL|2.0|This is a good collection of good Tull tunes, but not all-inclusive. Most disappointing for me is how chopped-down some of the tracks are (though there's not much other option with \\"Thick as a Brick\\"). Instead, I might recommend the newer live release Living With the Past. (I have the DVD.)
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is quite simply the best album of 2005 and if it doesnt make you want to roll down the windows and turn the music up loud on your car stereo or get up and dance in your living room then this is not for you!<br /><br />I find this album very refeshing but it also has hints of her previous albums Erotica, Music, Bedtime Stories, Ray Of Light and American Life, all of which I loved, but shes taken pieces of them and blended them into brand new songs. The casual Madonna listener might not even notice this, but crazy fans like me do!<br /><br />Anyway it is well worth a listen, my favorite songs are Hung Up, Jump, I love New York, Issac and well all of them actually!<br /><br />If you liked any of the above albums I mentioned you will LOVE this one too!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I gave my review for this album 1 star, since I already have the first addition and it is great!  I agree with many of the reviews regarding this UltraPlatinum Edition.  Why didn't Mariah put these items on the first disc???  Greedy, Greedy, Greedy...
0743424425|1.0|Big scary thing book with all the scary ghosts and making your body tremble as you go about reading this book. The fact that all that was told to us in the book and on the re-views, the real fact that it sucked. I hate it big and to tell you the truth your wasting your money on extra paper. If you like saving paper this isn't the book for you. Stephen King has a good idea going but is lacking when to stop and when its scary. <br /> The big opening of the book \\"Jack Torrance that thought: officious little prick\\" what is that? I simply got lost and told my self so what time are we in? What kind of people are we going to meet? When a book is made it should tell the reader more engaged of what the character already knows. This book should start out telling what time it is what am I looking at? What is the setting? A explanation of the characters would of made me more involved and more wanting to read on. Is every thing suppose to be this hard with Stephen King. <br /> When I first read it I was lost and wasn't scared and the parts that seemed to be scary was when Jack broke Danny's harm. That was when I stared to get attention to it but then I got lost again. I didn't know what I was reading anymore then again when scary stuff came up I just paid attention but really didn't get scared. Scary book, RIGHT!.  What was Stephen King thinking? The thing that I saw scary was his picture. The book is too much explanation of little things. The first chapter it just talks about Jack getting the job and then something from the past but that's it.  I bet if the book was just said a bit simpler it wouldn't be as big and would be more scarier. <br /> You want to scar the readers Stephen King? Vc. Andrews writs scarier novels then you and has the same length as your book. The book goes off explaining how there's food in there about on paragraph too long. All the guy had to say there's food in the cabinet in the refrigerator and so on. Don't need more then three lines to explain food.I need to get to really scary parts and make me scared or it sucks. <br /> When I saw the movie to it Danny starts to go into this trance or something of a thing where Tony is telling him something of future events. I really never get that from the book al of a sudden from reading the book he's there. I think they are already there at the place but no. I had to find out later that they are finally going to the hotel.. You must really love Stephen King if your going to buy his book. Stick to the movies Stephen king that's all your books are good for. I'd rather watch these movies on my television rather then reading because I simple don't get them. <br /> <br />buy from my suggestion Charstopher Pike better author and the books are scarier. :) hapy buying
B0000AUHQT|4.0|This classic novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald  has as far as I am aware of been made into two similiar but significantly different motion pictures. It is the version starring Robert Redford that I recommend as  Redford gives a convincingly accurate  portrayal of Gastby, the central  character among a group of people  whose lives are shattered by everything from adultry, dishonesty, accidental and deliberate murder, to hypocrisy in all its ugliness.   <br />No stone shall be left unturned by movies' end in this stunning storyline that truly hits on the human condition.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I was skeptical of this DVD set.  There is just so much material and the scope of the event was so large, I was not sure what to expect.  I really hoped that EMI would do Live 8 justice.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I will not comment on the actual concerts or my \\"favorite parts\\" or anything like that.  If you have not seen any of these concerts, you DEFINITELY need to get this DVD set.<br /><br />One note before I continue:  even though there are 4 DVDs in this package, it DOES NOT include the complete Philadelphia and London/Hyde Park concerts.  The vast majority of both concerts ARE included, but it definitely does not include everything.  You have been warned.<br /><br />This compilation takes all of the concert footage from that memorable day and rolls it into one beautiful, 10 hour concert.  The journey begins at the top of the London/Hyde Park concert with U2 and Paul McCartney.  The coverage continues in order from Hyde Park, then begins to alternate among all of the concerts.  The concert ends on Disc 3 as the Hyde Park concert ended, with Paul McCartney leading all of the London artists in \\"Hey Jude.\\"<br /><br />Disc 4 includes footage from the Edinburgh concert on 6 July 2005 (the \\"final push\\" concert).  It also contains some extra footage from the 2 July 2005 concerts that were not included on the first three discs.<br /><br />For those of you who, like me, watched the concerts live on AOL and then enjoyed their rebroadcasts of the event all summer, the three-disc concert feels similar to their main rebroadcast in which they, too, featured footage from all of the concerts.  It very well may be the same compilation with regard to content - I am not positive on that, though.<br /><br />The footage is truly gorgeous.  The live producers did a fantastic (almost super-human) job at trying to capture all of the action and emotion in real time at each venue.  The producers for this DVD edition, however, added more polish to an already well-done production.  The audio was re-mixed and corrected mistakes that were found in the live feed.  The video, too, was remastered to provide better angles throughout the concerts.  The video itself is beautiful.  Crisp, clean, and fluid.<br /><br />The footage is uncensored, which was nice to see.  With that, though, know that some of the footage is not for young ears.  Watch the concert first before showing it to your youngsters.<br /><br />Full concert footage for the Berlin, Paris, Rome, and Toronto concerts is available separately.  I am hoping that they also release full-concert editions of the Hyde Park and Philadelphia concerts, too.<br /><br />I really am pleased with this compilation.  Get yourself a copy or two or ten.  You will not be disappointed.eady well-done production.  The audio was re-mixed and corrected mistakes that were found in the live feed.

B000AY74OG|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS FREAKIN HILARIOUS!  We saw it in the theater and were rolling in our seats laughing.  Chris Rock is excellent as Marty, Ben Stiller is perfect for the role of Alex, Jada Pinkett Smith brings sass as Gloria and David Schwimmer is hilarious as Melman.<br /><br />Marty wants to go to the wild and escaped and his friends try and stop him and they get sent to Kenya but the oenguins turn the ship around and the four friends get hurled into the ocean and land on Madagascar.<br /><br />The penguins were cool and the monkeys were chucklers with their poo jokes, but I think the lemurs steal the show personally.  Sacha Baron Cohen was funny as King Julian and Cedric the Entertainer was good as Maurice.  This movie spoofed a couple of others and there are some tongue in cheek jokes that kids may not get but adults will think is hilarious.  An added bonus to this DVD is 'The penguins Christmas Caper' and the 'I like to move it, move it' music video.  It is loaded with plenty of games, too.<br /><br />I think this is a good family movie and there is something for everybody to enjoy.
0307276902|1.0|I have worked with alcoholics and addicts for many, many years, and I worked for the Hazelden Foundation, the treatment program the author indicates he attended. His description of the events in treatment never could have happened. All treatment centers are strictly regulated by a licensing board called the Joint Commission as well by state laws. What James Frey describes is in gross violation of these strict standards of accreditation. The treatment center would have been severely disciplined or shut down. Hazelden is one of the finest treatment centers in the world and is the pioneer of treatment as we know it today. Their treatment program is centered on respecting the dignity of each patient and preserving the safety of all who are admitted.  <br /> <br />James Frey would not have been admitted into treatment in such terrible medical condition without first being sent to a hospital for care and then admitted only after the hospital staff granted medical clearance. He wouldn't have been given stitches in his face at the treatment center, because treatment centers aren't licensed to give that level of medical care. Yes, recovering people can use anesthetic. Anesthetic is not an addictive drug, so no one needs to endure painful dental work or stitches or surgery without masking the pain. Pain medications (which are addictive) are used when necessary, such as after major surgery. <br /> <br />There are no men in white coats with syringes tackling people who misbehave. People in treatment don't behave in ways the author describes. People are mostly kind, caring and thoughtful. Disagreements are generally mild in nature, and mood-swings are usually the worst we must contend with. When someone behaves in an unacceptable manner, they are asked to change their behavior or be discharged. Treatment romances are never tolerated because they are a precursor to relapse and disrupt the entire unit. Physical violence always results in discharge, as does destruction of property.A patient would be asked to leave immediately if he destroyed a room full of furniture, for example. (Accomplishing this feat, by the way, would be extremely difficult because the furniture is made of heavy wood, built for endurance.)  <br /> <br />The author's assertion that a doctor left the ER without treating him and then drove him to an airport is equally astonishing. Putting a patient on an airplane, where he cannot access emergency medical care while suffering from severe head injuries is unthinkable.  That the airlines allowed James Frey on the plane is impossible to believe. These things simply aren't allowed to happen for very obvious and good reasons.  <br /> <br />It goes without saying that counselors don't drive patients to crack houses-or anywhere else-while they are in treatment. Doing so would result in immediate dismissal. Never have I heard people screaming in detox, nor would someone be left lying on a floor overnight. Patients are well monitored and vitals are checked on a regular basis to be certain that blood pressure isn't dangerously high due to the body coming off alcohol and/or drugs. Without close monitoring, we would risk strokes or heart attacks. It is also surprising that almost everyone the author went through treatment with has died or disappeared in rather unorthodox ways. I've never know of this to happen and none of my colleagues, whom I've asked, have ever heard of this either. We sometimes hear that one individual out of a treatment group dies, but even that is fairly rare. People do relapse after treatment, but that happens primarily because people don't follow their aftercare plan. <br /> <br />I hope if you read this book, you will keep in mind that this description of treatment is fiction. No one who is thinking of going into treatment to seek help should be afraid, thinking they will experience things similar to what the author has described. All reputable treatment centers offer caring support, preserve patients' dignityand will not allow one person's behavior jeopardize the wellbeing of all others. As for the author's assertion that he has stayed sober without the help of AA or other 12 step groups, that may be true, but only about 2% of addicted people find this method successful. And of that 2%, most continue to behave in much the same way they did when they were drinking or using drugs, only without the alcohol or drugs in their systems. Sometimes they are so unhappy and angry being \\"dry\\" because, without a recovery program, they haven't learned to find contentment in sobriety, and their behavior becomes more intolerable than before. The main purpose of AA isn't just to quit drinking or taking drugs, but to become a better person in recovery.
B000BO0LLS|4.0|Mariah is back again with a new rerelease of her hugely successful album Emancipation of Mimi.

Mariah is and will always be the greatest...
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Compared to her last CD \\"American Life,\\" a dark moody underproduced collection of songs that did not connect with the buying public,Madonna is back and aims to get back on the charts where she once dominated. The music here is very 80's inspired new wave/dance music with sampled musical elements from such nostalgic greats like Kraftwork and Giorgio Moroder.Its a great collection of  retro pop/dance tunes that are sequenced together for your continuious dancing pleasure. The songs are well crafted with stand out tracks such as \\"Jump and Get Together\\" which sound like future potential singles. Not all songs are as catchy as the current single \\"Hung up\\" but a collection with little fillers is a welcome return from one of the great female icons of our time.
0671759159|1.0|UPDATE     Don't like my review?  Then read the highest rated one which gives this book 2 stars.  102 of 108 people found the review By Giancarlo Nicoli helpful.  You can't miss his review, it is the top of the list of reviews.      Also a book I recommend instead is;  How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times and Bad, Fourth Edition  by William J. O'Neil    ==================  Peter Lynch's book held me back about 10 years in my investing success.  I used to believe things I read in books because a good publisher like Simon and Schuster would publish it.  Per Lynch, I counted cars in parking lots of companies with due diligence and questioned managers on how things were selling.  But talking to managers could be months after the stock broke an important support level and about to crash.  There are no SELL RULES in the book!!!  Where do I take a PROFIT???  I ended up watching a stock go up, then it comes down say 20% off the high, I go to talk with the manager of a store and he says product is selling well so I figure I should hold the stock.  Then the stock goes down below where I bought it.   What good is that strategy?     Also per Peter Lynch I avoided \\"reading tealeaves\\" like drawing trend lines on what I was actually concerned about- THE PRICE -of the stock!  But this is what works for me.  Now I make a living \\"reading tealeaves\\" or technical analysis and leave the counting cars in parking lots of companies I am investing in to those who think counting cars makes the price of a stock go up.       My suggestion is to learn basic technical analysis from a book like John murphys Technical Analysis of the financial markets.  Start there then go on to learn more advanced TA.  I also like Investor's Business Daily-BUT it is very specialized and takes reading several times and probably help from a more advanced user to understand IBD.  I also swingtrade - hold stocks for 2-5 days sometimes longer.      J
0307276902|2.0|I was really expecting much more - it was one of those books that I couldn't wait to finish and started skimming through repetitious pages towards the end. I hated all the characters whether they were addicts or reformed addicts. Sorry, unless you like to read about gross and dispicable low lifes, pick another book.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|Yes it's true: the Widescreen 16:9 version on the new Disney DVD has the theatrical cut...MINUS When Love Is Gone...the song that Disney inexplicably cut out of the movie in theaters and so enraged Brian Henson that he made sure it was restored to EVERY video version of MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL...that is until now :( <br /> <br />While the Widescreen 16:9 version gets the cut version, the Full-Screen Version is touted as the \\"Extended Version with Deleted Scene!\\" -- what a joke that Disney didn't get this right, giving the cropped pan-and-scan frame the version of the movie any real fan of the movie prefers to see. <br /> <br />It truly, sadly, seems as if we're cursed to EVER getting a proper widescreen release of the correct Director's Cut of MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL -- because it's not on this new 2005 DVD, either!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's new album is absolutely amazing from beginning to end and you cant help but want to dance for the whole hour of music. Being a huge fan of Madonna for just about her whole career, I am always ecstatic when she puts out a new album.  I must say that \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is already my new favorite Madonna album and I have only had it for 2 days. This is a must own album for any Madonna fan (duh) to anybody who loves to dance, and sing and get up and do thier thing!!!  Congrats Madonna, this ROCKS!!!!!
B00006LWSF|4.0|Dude, this CD is great! Hey if you like Eminem, go to the \\"used and New\\" section, and look for a collectable one that is $20. Thats my deal, But know this, you get 2 other eminem cd's free with my deal. Check it out for yourself. Anyway,i'm giving it a 4 out of 5 because i'm not realy into rap much more. But dude, the first time I heard it... it was like cheesecake man, it's truly an awesome CD.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is one of many pinnacle productions by Madonna. A collection of her past strong suits thrown together with that new 2006 feel. Dance all the way through. I hear overtones of EROTICA, MUSIC and BEDTIME STORIES. The sexy, the trance and the dance can all be found here in CONFESSIONS.<br /><br />I am in love with this one. It's what a lot of people want. A slightly mindless record to just put on and not have to skip one song. At the same time the lyrics are very heartfelt and well written.  Just relax, let go and DANCE HONEY!!!
0553801503|5.0|This book only focuses on a select number of the vast plethora of charecters in Mr. Martin's series (the others will be in his next book to come out in the next year).  The charecters that the book focused on were developed well and this book said enough to further the story at a rather lively pace and to also leave me wanting more.  Much more.  It was a read that left me wanting more of Martin's genius and I await anxiously for the A dance with Dragons.
1400031087|4.0|A great book, hard to put down. Not for someone who can't handle cussing, but you shouldn't have a problem with cussing since you read the book discription before buying it... right.. <br /> <br />also, do yourself a favor and do NOT read the epilogue until you finish the book. :O
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a great movie and always will be. Everything in this movie is great. Especially Tom Hanks. No one could have played the role of Forrest better than he did. This movie may even be Tom Hank's best movie. Everything in this movie is fantastic. They just don't make movies like this anymore.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Once again, System has amazed me.  Bringing new things to the table but yet maintaing their brilliant style of music.  They are crazy, and thats whats great about them.  With super fast beats and flawless vocals harmonized to perfection, any hard rock or prog rock fan is bound to like Mesmerize.  What also makes this CD great is that its part of a 2 disc release, even though the latter half of the CD is being released at a later date. Any system fan will highly enjoy this release and I highly recommend to any prog rock or hard rock listener.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|If a club played \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" straight through, I would dance to every moment and not care what I looked like or who was watching. Madonna's latest album is utterly sublime. True, there are some escapist, poppy moments like \\"Hung Up,\\" \\"Sorry\\" and the electrifying \\"Jump,\\" one of the most fun songs she's sung in years. But there are more poignant moments as well, as she questions her place and her fame in the melancholy, but still danceable, \\"How High.\\" Beyond all the buoyancy, there's a weight to these songs, a personality and craft that gets lost in the \\"thump-thump\\" of generic club music. I've stuck with Madonna through thick and thin and her latest album makes me more glad than ever that I've stuck around for the ride.
B000BGH22W|3.0|I raise the Goblet of Rock to you...a bit.<br /><br /> I must admit to feeling some disappointment at knowledge of JOHN WILLIAMS absence as composer. But, I am glad to report, that some of Williams' style and themes are still apparent in the work of replacement composer Patrick Doyle. The Quidditch World Cup theme (track #3) is the most interesting track with its cross-culture references to both the Ireland team and the Bulgarian team. Even before seeing the movie, it is easy to connect this piece to the game and pre-game moments. This track is the most outstanding piece of music on the CD.<br /><br />The rest of the score is more pedestrian, than Williams would have assembled, not bad, just not exceptional.<br /><br />What truly breaks the HP soundtrack mold is the addition of rock to \\"The Goblet.\\" Yule Ball songs are provided by the Weird Sisters care of: Jarvis Cocker of  PULP and members of RadioHead. They perform \\"Do the Hippogriff,\\" \\"This is the Night,\\" and \\"Magic Works.\\" Those songs are raw, perfect for the sort of performance you might hear at a school dance....and I mean that in a good way. Yelling at the crowd and WHATNOT. These \\"Ball\\" tracks are placed at the end of the CD following the instrumentals.<br /><br />I would recommend this CD to fans of the Potter movies and soundtrack collectors.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"Madonna is BACK!\\" says Amazon.com reviewers and critics alike.  My question is:  Did she ever go away?    This is an excellent cd.  Like any piece of art, you must consider the intent of the artist to absorb, understand and ultimately decide whether this piece of work is as brilliant as everyone is saying it is - or rubbish.   Madonna set out to make a party-starting dance cd, and has done exactly that.    By now you've probably heard the opening track \\"Hung Up\\".   It is catchy, infectious, bass-heavy and downright fun.   I'd say the rest of the album can be described the same way (albeit full of some vary diverse dance tracks, most better than this first single).    Rather than give a track by track review, let me just highlight the strongest songs:    GET TOGETHER - The alarm bell / tick tock of \\"Hung Up\\" blends wonderfully into this body-swaying tune that's destined to be a classic.   \\"Can we get together?\\" croons Madonna, as producer Stuart Price's signature synth keyboards and heavy bass take the listener on such an enjoyable journey through dance.    I LOVE NEW YORK - However you feel about New York, you will either love or LOATHE this song.   I love it.   It's syncopated bass line and rich swirling production wash-out any of the somewhat contrived lyrics.   As a dance album, I'm not expecting the lyrics to be poetic or even grammatically correct, and I think that helps you to lose yourself in some of these tracks.   ILNY almost verges on full-rock towards the end and will bring out the head-banger in everyone.    PUSH - Typical Madonna.   And that's a sensational thing.   Track 11 (\\"PUSH\\") slows the energetic rhythm of the rest of the cd to deliver an excellent melody and shifting bass.   Gone are the controversies of \\"Like A Prayer\\", the \\"American Life\\" rap, or suggestive lyrics of \\"Erotica\\"; instead, this track is pure radio-friendy bliss.   Digitized background singing and intriguing samples carry this tune to the album closer, \\"Like It Or Not\\".    There's plenty of other strong songs on this album - \\"Jump\\" and \\"How High\\" seem appropriately placed together and really will make you jump - or at the very least, dance.  \\"Sorry\\" the album's rumoured second single, sees Madonna saying Sorry in several different langages but it is the catchy chorus and descending bass that will get your feet tapping.    Dance lovers, Pop lovers and, of course, Madonna fans will be delighted with this latest offering.   Like Madonna says on her closing track \\"You can love me or leave me, but I'm never gonna stop\\".   And that's excellent news for popular music.
B00000099Y|5.0|Maynard broke the mold with this one! Its rare that an album has more than one or two songs I like, almost every track in this album is transcendent. My favorite is probably Eulogy. Simply sublime....dark, but sublime.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Holy cow! This is so exciting, I haven't bought a Madonna album since Erotica and Bedtime Stories (and felt bad kind of abandoning her sound, but..) I was starting to give up on Madonna, but here she is again with a great cd! <br /> <br />Seriously, if the 1 star people have HEARD the cd, I would take in their criticisms, but these people haven't heard it, especially the ones that can't get the name of the first single right!! <br /> <br />Some parts of this cd remind me of the song \\"Rescue Me\\" (Madonna) because of the spoken parts over a dance beat, and part \\"Ray of Light\\" on 'Future Lovers', just because of the 'space age' type feel. <br /> <br />Best songs (so far!) are \\"Hung Up\\", the brilliant trance-y track \\"Get Together\\", \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Push\\" to name a few..top song for me is Get Together...super hot! <br /> <br />This is a hot cd, whether you like Madonna or not. I give props to her! I hope she stays in this 'reincarnation' for a while, as it suits her very well!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I nearly didn't buy this mainly because alot of the reunions of other old bands I have seen just don't live up to expectations, but I guess we all have that expectation that they are going to be as good if not close to what they were like in there heyday.  Well to all the negative reviewers I think you always have to keep in mind that Jack, Ginger and Eric are not 20 anymore they are all in their 60's and man do they kick some of those young bands arses in this performance.  Someone said they looked tired on this performance come on man what are you on these guys smoked I mean Gingers solo on toad how many drummers who still play that are in their 60's do solos like they are 20 year olds.  To me ginger baker is the best rock drummer ever his arms seem to have minds of their own amazing.  I was amazed at Jack Bruces voice and how great it sounded I mean it was no different to what it was in 68'.  And some of the sounds coming out of Erics Guitar WOW it just sounded awsome.  If you are leaning towrds getting this but are not quite sure do it.  It is just Awsome very emotional and these guys seem genuanlly glad to be playing together again. Cream lives and the guitar GOD is back.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I must say I was wondering what sort of sound Death Cab would have with this new album of theirs. Ben Gibbard said on his site that the only change once they signed to Atlantic that there'd be an \\"Atlantic logo\\" on the back of the album art and everything they stood for and made musically would stay the same. I had faith in his words and my faith paid off. This album is beautiful.   Sadly many complain that they have sold out? Why don't you people go back to the basement clubs you came from and listen to the music that is on this album rather than look at what record company backs their awesome music?   It is a truly beautiful album that combines amazingly original drumming, super delicious bass, jangy sweet guitars, and soultry piano.   That also bothers me that some complain that they are more a \\"guitar band\\" and not a \\"piano band\\", did they even hear Translanticism?! It has some tracks that have JUST piano on it (i.e Passenger Seat). The piano is a wonderful addition and always has been to their already unique sound.   This is and always has been one of the best atmospheric bands I've ever heard. Even after they've signed to Atlantic it still fools me as the true \\"Atmospheric/mellow/Indie\\" they always were on Barsuk records and if not better.   \\"Plans\\" is like the sister/brother album to \\"Transitlanticism\\". If \\"Trans.\\" was the inhale then \\"Plans\\" is the exhale, just as refreshing and beautiful as the inhale. I highly recommend this beautiful CD to anyone who has really sincere musical taste. A wonderful journey throughout the whole CD you will be taken on if you decide to walk through it with understanding and an open mind.   Peace,  Ty
B00064ADR0|5.0|Johnny Winter deserves his place in the pantheon occupied by Hendrix, Clapton, McLaughlin, Reinhardt and now I'm running out.  This is Texas electric blues at its best.<br /><br />The original LP was an instant classic, and this compilation actually improves on it with studio cuts and live tracks.  Studio: Early In The Morning and Tell The Truth, both outstanding.  Live cuts: 1-6 are all excellent, especially Mean Town Blues which is nothing short of dazzling.<br /><br />After that, tragedy strikes as brother Edgar steps forward to sour the milk.  His singing resembles nothing more closely than a horrifying Ella Fitzgerald impression.  However, by then it is too late for these missteps to spoil what is definitely a house-burning, rip-it-up rock/blues masterpiece.  Check out Memory Pain.
B00082IJ08|5.0|The third offical release from The Gorillaz, this time the \\"group\\" took a different route from their underground self titled cd and \\"G-sides\\" the remix ep. <br /> <br />First Del The Funkee Homosapien left the band, and Dan The Automators job was passed on to the great DJ DangerMouse, leaving Damon Albarn a clean slate and much more room to experiment with lyrics and which direction he wanted to take the cd. As stated in his MTV interview he said that \\"This cd is darker then the previous Gorillaz\\" and in that is what we got. A gloomier more gritty sound with a whole new line up of colaborations with rapers such as MF DOOM (who some consider to be one of the most intelegent off the wall fun rapers to date) and with De La Soul who is on the first singal Feel Good Inc. just to name a few of the notorious underground rappers which have been made into almost a 'click' of underground superstars who never dissapoint. <br /> <br />Once again Damon Albarn and friends pulled it off. Even though its a different sound, there are still the notable present themes in The Gorillaz music. You have super sampling of George A. Romeros zombie classics, and Damons present love for the actor Clint Eastwood (Hopefully there are more tracks with a Clint theme) because \\"Diry Hairy\\" which has been said to be the follow up of one of their career making songs \\"Clint Eastwood\\" is just as good as its predecessor. They share a similarity in ways, one being the strangly dark song with lyrics that don't match. But then again, if anything made sence during the first listen, it wouldnt quite be the Gorillaz, because each of their songs old and new have you thinking and pondering what was the intent and deeper meaning of it. But the best part about this album is that it has a story telling quality to it. Each of these tracks you want to listen to in order because it takes you on a roller coaster ride through you head and you get deeply entranced in each song and you want to find out what the next onewill be like. Every time I listen to this album I never get tired of it. Only song I remotely ever came close to skipping was \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" because it was repeatedly played on Tv at least 2-3 times a day. But this is one of thoes cds where everyone has a favorite song, and to them it could never get boring. My personal favorite is Deamon Days. Its a very chilling end to the cd which leaves me feeling like i didnt waist my time listening to a cd, and that Damon really put all that he could into it. <br /> <br /> <br />But in the end, this more structed, more defined Gorillaz cd is a must have for any music lover, and for fans alike. You will not be dissapointed, and you might become a lover of The Gorillaz Yourself.
B0000009S3|5.0|A gem. This is Zappa that can be enjoyed by people who don't \\"get\\" Zappa. It's musical, it kicks, it's fun, at times it's even beautiful (Little Umbrellas, Son Of Mr. Green Genes).<br /><br />Zappa, a true genius by any yardstick, was famous for his bizarre musical theatre which mixed orchestral, rock, and jazz with \\"anti-music\\", sound effects, and assorted snippets of irreverence. He is justifiably criticized for being a shameless misogynist with a sophomoric sense of humor.<br /><br />But his musical vision was always fearlessly original and even at its worst, interesting. This was the first album where he forgot about being clever, plugged in the axe, and wore it out. Fantastic supporting cast as well, with the exception of Captain Beefheart whose additions are always unwelcome.<br /><br />Zappa did re-jigger the masters (an annoying habit of his) but fortunately no major damage was done. Arguably Zappa's best effort, with the possible exception of Only In It For The Money.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I was intrigued by all the good reviews this album has gotten lately and being a fan of her music, I have all of her albums. The good reviews made me even more excited about her new album, but after a couple listens, I think this one will wear out its welcome really fast. Yes, it has irresistable beats guaranteed to move bodies on a dance floor. Yes, it recalls her earlier days when her music seemed pointless fun. Yes, it infuses her new sound (of her post-Evita albums) in an interesting mix between the new and retro. Unfortunately, despite those elements, the cliched lyrics wear down the artistic aspect of this album. She rhymes \\"New York\\" with \\"dork\\", which is something you expect to find in high school poetry, not an artist of her calibre. She also says things like \\"sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt\\" and \\"the devil you know...\\" Couldn't she come up with something more clever? After all, she made fun of Kevin Costner (\\"Truth or Dare\\") when he called her 1990 Blonde Ambition Tour \\"neat\\". Now she's getting lazy in her choice of words.    Despite its underselling performance, I loved her last album \\"American Life\\" (except for the bland title song with some bad raps about \\"soy lattes, pilates, and a roomful of hotties\\"). It was a musical journey with many single-worthy songs. Even two years later, I still listen to it in awe and never tire of its sounds. However, with her new album, it will probably grow on me but I seriously don't think it will become a classic in her musical canon. It may sell well through the end of the year, but will fade away into discoesque oblivion(much like U2's much maligned \\"Pop\\" album and \\"Discotheque\\" cheesiness).    My favorite song on this one is \\"Isaac\\", the one that garnered controversy among her Kabbalah church community. She infuses rhythms from the middle east and India into a very spiritual dance song as only Madonna can do. If this album had more of that on there, I would rate it much higher. But as of now, I still think \\"American Life\\" and \\"Music\\" are better albums. This one is about equal to \\"Ray of Light\\". Good for a musical journey that your ears can feast on while the feet keep moving...but if you want profound lyrics, you're thinking too much. Madonna has nothing new to say. Maybe writing children's books have sapped her ability to be delightfully ironic/iconic. Despite my disappointments, however, I always appreciate Madonna's growth as an artist and her ability to reinvent herself. While other 80s icons like stuck in their \\"Thriller/Bad\\" days or in abusive marriages (Whitney Houston, anyone?), Madonna continues to evolve in interesting ways. Artists like Britney Spears needs to take note so she can get out of her artistic slump.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Her critics said she was a flash in the pan. She wouldn't last. Nobody stays on top for long. Madonna's fans knew better, and so did The Lady herself, and she proved it time and again with new and better entries, constantly reinventing herself and raising her genre even higher along the way.<br /><br />Two decades later, with children at her feet, Lady Madonna returns to her roots - dance and exuberance -with her latest vocal offerings, and it's a festival for her longtime fans as well as a new generation. Although upbeat and, well, danceable, she as usual reveals bits of herself in the lyrics, such as \\"I Love New York\\" \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Let It Will Be.\\"<br /><br />A wondrous latest from a true star, and just in time for Christmas. Love Live The Queen!

B0000C3I6U|5.0|The opening scene of \\"Pumping Iron\\" sees Arnold Schwarzenegger and his workout buddy Franco Columbu taking ballet classes to improve their competitive stage presentation and is every bit as interesting as the rest of the things you have heard about \\"Pumping Iron\\" and then some more. Not only does its star make \\"Pumping Iron\\" a massive seventies docudrama, but this docudrama made its star a massive actor. Based on the book of the same title, director George Butler asked the then twenty-eight year old, five times winning Mr. Olympia, to help them shine light on the world of bodybuilding, a subject that had been perceived as something to do with men with inferiority complexes, with advertisements for muscle gain programs relegated to the back pages of comic books, now bodybuilding technique had matured enough to offer true athletic ability with a large potential for discovering new things about the human body that where not considered possible before. Schwarzenegger, an Austrian immigrant, brought the film crew to \\"Gold's Gym\\" in sunny California to capture him in training, yet instead of showing us boring set after set of workout repetitions, \\"Pumping Iron\\" follows the competition in the guise of various bodybuilding characters, from the family man, Mike Katz, with a chest like a truck, to the curly haired symmetrical powerhouse bad guy, Ken Waller, who likes to hide a bodybuilder's T-shirt on the day of the competition to psyche him out during the Mr. Universe finals. The central story revolves around Arnold's ego, the size of which even NASA could not launch into space, and a shy deaf kid from New York, Lou Ferrigno (The Incredible Hulk in the television series) who idolizes Arnold and with the help of his domineering father trains to take the title away from his hero. The preparation for the 1975 Mr. Olympia, to be held in Pretoria, which was to be the first ever multiracial sports event in South Africa, is portrayed by moving back and forth between the luminous veils of the west coast and the industrial compound of New York City where we see the men of bronze pushing themselves to the limit by lifting weights that would be enough to fall a horse. All the big names of the bodybuilding world are here - Reg Park, Roger Callard, Ed Corney, Serge Nubret, Robbie Robinson and Joe Weider. Arnold's `little' partner, Franco Columbu, pulls a number of stunts like lifting a car and blowing up a hot water bottle like a balloon, while the Austrian Oak talks about how the feeling of getting pumped is like cumming with a woman, debates his passion by explaining how he didn't turn up to his father's funeral because he was too busy training or decides to smoke a joint on camera, all of which are controversial Arnie topics till this very day, but the important `thirty years later' DVD extras do shed light on some of these moments, along with important questions about steroid abuse. The highlight of \\"Pumping Iron\\" is when Arnold pulls off a Mr. Olympia stage shift where he pumps himself up like a puffer fish... you have never seen Arnold this big before, nor will we again. This is the movie that spawned numerous gyms across the globe so that people could get into shape. Coupled with Arnold's book \\"Encylopedia of Modern Bodybuiling\\", this DVD certainly is the modern bodybuilder's #1 motivation tool and the bodybuilding docudrama that reshaped Hollywood.ils of the west coast and the industrial compound of New York City where we see the men of bronze pushing themselves to the limit by lifting weights that would be enough to fall a horse.

B000B8QEZG|3.0|The Queen of re-invention is back. This time around, Madonna tries to conquer the 70s dancefloor... And she does create the  feel quite nicely with Confessions On A Dance Floor. <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\" is without a doubt the best track on here. Highly catchy and uplifting, this is the kind of song that will get in your head and will refuse to leave. And the sample taken off Abba's \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" is a nice fit here! In fact, better used here than in the actual Abba song, if I may say so... Some other top tracks on Confessions are \\"Push\\", \\"How High\\" and \\"Get Together\\". <br /> <br />Confessions On A Dancefloor is such an appropriate title for this record. Not only it is highly dancey, and probably something you would hear on the dancefloor, but the lyrics are highly introspective at the same time, almost confessional: It's funny, I spent my whole life wanting to be talked about / I did it, just about everything to see my name in lights / Was it all worth it? / And how did I earn it? / Nobody's perfect, I guess I deserve it.  <br /> <br />This is 70s disco with a 21st century twist. Although most songs on Confessions are just okay, there are a couple of outstanding tracks. Anyone with a love for good pop music will enjoy listening to this.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Your very last hope of redemption draweth nigh!    If anyone is wondering why there are hundreds of 5 star reviews for the Serenity DVD without anyone even seeing it yet, it's because these Browncoats/Whedonites are once again trying to evangelize the world, only this time it's about buying the movie's DVD.  (Theory has it that they'll get a sequel that way.)    Anyways, I love Firefly and Serenity myself -- but I'm (gasp!) a *regular* person who simply likes good sci-fi when he sees it.  And I try really hard to forget that a whole bunch of others who like this stuff are just oozing with creepitude.    Now let the 0 Browncoats who find this review helpful commence!

B000002HB4|5.0|GEORGIA SATELLITES-LET IT ROCK/BEST OF THE GEORGIA SATELLITES: One of Southern Rock's last great greasy gasps, these guys kicked more ass than a high school football coach, letting fly with a raunchy attitude spiced with kickin' country, dirty soul, and bar band boogie. Helmed by bad boy belters/geetar slingers Dan Baird and Rick Roberts, the Satellites boasted brontosaurus chops, snotty swagger AND a sense of humor...which never hurt NOBODY no how in the rock & roll biz. Monster hit KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELF sets the piledriver pace for this career roundup appropriately named after one of Chuck Berry's most tread upon chestnuts. Crash 'n burn covers of HIPPY HIPPY SHAKE, the Ringo Starr-penned DON'T PASS ME BY, and a party-perfect John Fogerty medley of ALMOST SATURDAY NIGHT/ROCKIN' ALL OVER THE WORLD blend seamlessly with Baird's bare bones double entendre OPEN ALL NIGHT and the blooze-buster ALL OVER BUT THE CRYIN'. Cranked to an especially high thrash threshold is Terry Anderson's BATTLESHIP CHAINS, three minutes of rock so primitive I'm surprised Fred Flintstone didn't write it. These wild cats were too good to last beyond a few albums, but LET IT ROCK delivers a stompin' summary of their meat n' taters years.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE BEER BLASTS
B000B8QEZG|5.0|With a reputation for constantly \\"reinventing\\" herself, the former \\"Material Girl\\" has released an album that is destined to top the charts internationally.  \\"Confessions on the Dance Floor\\" is, by far, Madonna's best album in over a decade.  Unlike the experimental \\"Ray of Light,\\" the pop-friendly \\"Music,\\" and the disastrous \\"American Life,\\" this new album hits all the right notes with its blend of Euro-disco, trance, and world pop, always hitting the beats that would be acceptable in New York, Tokyo, Buenos Aires, London, Helsinki, Sydney, and even Moscow.<br /><br />While critics have said that the singer has returned to her roots, it is obvious that Madonna knows exactly what will sell and this one works on a variety of levels.<br /><br />Each of the twelve cuts is worthy of release as singles, with the strongest being \\"Hung Up,\\" \\"Get Together, \\"Sorry\\" (featuring a bass line liberally borrowed from The Jackson's \\"Can You Feel It?\\"),\\" the Giorgio Moroder-sounding \\"Future Lovers\\", and the revealing \\"Like it or Not\\".<br /><br />I can't wait for the remixes 'cause they're going to be something GRANDIOSE!
B000BGH22W|5.0|I thought at first I put a wrong CD in when I heard Matrix soundtrack, but 15 seconds later the music smoothly went a different road. The fourth soundtrack from the Harry Potter series is here and it is terrific.  It briefly acknowledges its predecessors (the works by John Williams) and for the rest of the album has its own recurring theme. The general tone is rather dark, which is no surprise for the scariest book so far. But it also has bright and cheerful parts. Personally I think Rita Skeeter gets much better deal in the movie than in the book (as her track brings happy memories from childhood). <br /> <br />Amazon lists only 21 tracks, while there are actually 24. I can see why many listeners would not like the last three, but they are essential part of the movie. With the book's events happening in our current time, muggles' songs make their way into the magic world whether we want it or not. Also, although the soundtrack closely follows the movie, the 3 \\"rock\\" tracks were placed at the end instead of their real place, so that anyone could easily skip them and concentrate on the \\"classical\\" part. <br /> <br />It won't take more than one round to get into the soundtrack, thanks to the clear theme appearing here and then. And even the scariest parts end with soothing melody, reinforcing once again that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.  Bravo to Patrick Doyle for such fabulous work!
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed certainly caught many critics and people off guard when their debut album, MY OWN PRISON, went multi-platinum and spawned four number one singles. It was certainly a gritty, dark, religious-intoned album that, while slightly Christian in its themes, was hard rock and anguish coupled into one. It certainly helped Creed become a force in the rock world, and HUMAN CLAY further defined that establishment for them with a strong collection of 11 songs. <br /> <br />\\"Higher\\" was probably Creed's biggest anthem, a soaring rock song complete with wishes of a better tomorrow. \\"Are You Ready\\" is another surge of hard rock, with more questions than answers, and Scott Stapp's vocals gritty and growling. Mark Tremonti's guitar sound has grown fuller, and bassist Brian Marshall and drummer Scott Phillips lock in nicely as the rhythm section. \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" was written for the birth of Scott Stapp's child, and it's certainly one of the strongest songs Creed has written. \\"What If\\" may be the darkest song on the album, along with \\"Never Die\\", that combines squalls of monster guitar and bwomping rhythms. Throughout these 11 tracks, Creed's sound has filled in more nicely, with some hints of keyboard here and there, but make no mistake, the other instruments are all in charge over the course of this collection. \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Say I\\" are surging rock songs as well, and this is a well-rounded album. <br /> <br />Establishing Creed even more into the rock realm, HUMAN CLAY sheds most of its criticisms because it's a strong record. With four number one singles and a few Grammy nominations, HUMAN CLAY certainly is another strong collection of songs from Creed.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Won't even consider the short and long term effects of this CD on the security of our computers and the information thereon. <br /> <br />No music is worth the enormous risk Santana and Sony are inflicting on us in a less than honest manner. The back peddling is fine and all, but its far safer to simply ban these artists and Sony from the house. <br /> <br />Its not even that we won't buy them, we will actively scan all music friends bring over for dinner to ensure its not Sony. <br /> <br />The EULA is silly, I don't agree and I won't read ammendments in the future. <br /> <br />The answer is simply No.
B0002IU988|4.0|Creed was one of the biggest rock bands in the country during its three albums and six plus years as a group, even though they had been together longer. WEATHERED was their biggest album, selling over 800,000 copies its first week. However, the success of the album crippled the band, and the band dissipated and Creed was no more. Three of the members, guitarist Mark Tremonti, bassist Brian Marshall, and drummer Scott Phillips were dabbling in a side project with Myles Kennedy, lead singer of Mayflower Four. After the four jammed together, Alter Bridge was ultimately born. From the sounds of this debut album, they have let loose and made a very good rock album that, while derivative and slightly Creed-ish, is entertaining all the way through.     First of all, \\"Find The Real\\" is one hell of a rock song, and Mark Tremonti is obviously letting himself loosen a bit, moreso then he did on any of Creed's albums. His lead on this song is great, very gritty and sandy. It's a great lead-off track, and it's a precursor for the sound that dominates much of the rest of the album. \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is an anthem in its own right, and it's just as majestic as \\"Higher\\" was for Creed. Elsewhere, the band explore melodic metal on \\"Broken Wings\\", which is probably the most heartfelt song on the album; they get down and dirty for the drilling metal of the aptly titled \\"Metalingus\\"; and they turn up the volume for the near-anthem status of the lush rock in \\"Burn It Down\\". This album is chock full of good moments, and the title track is a testament to that. \\"The End Is Here\\" is titled not-so because it's the last song on the album, but more as a reminder that this band is serious about their music and their compassion to play it right. The only shortfall is that, sometimes, Tremonti's guitar might remind you of Creed, and if you put Scott Stapp's voice on \\"Open Your Eyes\\", it could have easily been a Creed song.     All those quibbles aside, ONE DAY REMAINS is a very impressive rock solidalbum. From front to back, these guys pour out passion, emotion, heart, and true gritty, dirty rock 'n' roll into an impressive package that, while somewhat familiar, leads us on a very enjoyable journey into the hard rock realm.
B000002H97|4.0|Great album very clean and very full sounding.  Despite the catchy tunes this is the album that marked the end of Metallica and gave a preview of their future direction.  I love this album but it is far from being my favorite Metallica album.  The best part of this album is deffinately the production quality.  Excellent sound and production, but it could also be argued that this was also its weakness as its excellent production kind of downplayed the rawness and intensity that previous albums had.  All in all grat album.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Homer's Iliad has incredible potential to be made into a powerhouse film. I think this movie fulfilled only part of that potential. <br />I have heard a number of people comment on the fact that this movie doesn't exactly follow Homer's Iliad; this is true. It clearly says at the end of the movie that it was \\"inspired\\" by the Iliad, not that it is an adaptation of it. I'm no expert on Greek mythology, but I have read and studied the Iliad; the movie didn't offend me too much from the storyline perspective. It is necessary to adapt many things when translating a thousands-year-old epic into a modern Hollywood epic. <br />I think casting Brad Pitt as Achilles was a mistake, a blatant appeal to Pitt's status as a sex icon. He did a rather cold, uninspiring job as the lead, and unfortunately the whole film seems to center around him. I think the problem with casting Bradd Pitt in that role has more to do with the fact that he is Brad Pitt than with his actual acting skills. <br />The action scenes were good, but the camera work on the large battle scenes could have been better. All you see is a mass of men going at it with spear and shield; there are few close-up shots of the fighting.  <br />There were some questionable edits. For example, there is a scene with a soldier on horseback riding up a mountain and getting shot with arrows -- that is the whole scene. It doesn't appear to be connected in any way to what comes before or after it. (Or perhaps I just missed the point.) <br />Finally, as a musician, I have to comment on the score. It was a boring, bland, mass-produced Hollywood epic score. What else is there to say? They could have done a lot more with the music. I did enjoy the haunting vocals, however. <br />Overall, it is a decent Hollywood epic, but it could have been a lot more inspiring. It's worth a watch.
B00005JNX0|3.0|In the campy computer animated film Madagascar a quartet of zoo animals find themselves pondering and experiencing the meaning of life and the social context of life.  It is an interesting idea to contemplate that what a zoo animal would think, if they existed outside of the fences of the zoo.  However, several studies have shown that animals that have grown up in captivity run a great chance of extinction once released into the wild.  Nevertheless, animated comedy tries to apply the notion of setting free tame animals into the wilderness, which offers an amusing rollercoaster that throws pies and pulls the chair from underneath the audience with a myriad of silly slapstick moments.<br /><br />Several computer-animated films that have received a blockbuster release such as Toy Story (1995), Shrek (2001), and The Incredibles (2004), and sequels have also driven in a large chunk of money.  Most CGI animations have been exceptional in their narratives, thus why not make another animated film with the help of computers.  However, Madagascar lacks some of the brilliant storytelling that has gone hand-in-hand with CGI films.  Unfortunately, most of the film tends to build on previously applied humor, and an exaggerated amount of slapstick humor.  After awhile the silly tripping and slams in the face become an uninspiring event of repetitive thinking and mere time fillers in the featured film.<br /><br />Despite the negative aspects, there is still some greatness within the film, as the four animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) begin their journey into the unknown.  The caricature of the quartet is terrific, as the Alex superego emerges in the gifts he gives his friends and the overwhelmingly hysterical hypochondriac Melman.  The best part in the film is the four scheming penguins that are on a mission to return to the snowy widths of Antarctica, and the meeting with Sacha Baron Cohen a.k.a. Ali G's lemur persona King Julien XIII.<br /><br />The story opens with an amusing dream sequence where Marty dreams of his personal paradise in the wilderness, as he is racing towards a small lake.  Alex, who also chased him in the dream, shatters this dream.  It is an amusing comparison between the dream and reality, as Marty's reality consists of having a lion as a friend while in the dream Alex was chasing him.  Furthermore, it suggests the idea of a twisted sense of reality that Marty and the other zoo animals possess.  To broaden the concept of twisted reality, it might serve as an analogical perspective of humanity's la-la land vision of life's permanence and the idea of existential safety.  However, this is to stretch the artistic process of the computer-animated zoological journey into an intellectual domain, which illustrates a number of interesting concepts in the light of Darwin where the strongest survive.<br /><br />Marty decides to make his dream reality, as he escapes to explore the world.  Actually he intends to explore New York and maybe a little of what lays beyond the city borders.  However, his three friends intend to find him and return him to the safety of the zoo while they all are unaware of humans true feelings of wild animals, in particular lions.  To their dismay, they learn that they are returning to Africa, as society deems that they belong in their natural habitat.  However, after an accident relating four penguins involved in a large ship hijacking, the quartet lands on the beaches of Madagascar.  Several different emotions flush through them such as anger, fear, panic, happiness, and hope, as they try to get their bearings on the life in the wild.  It is amusing to see how they handle the new situation, as they mostly appear like people visiting a foreign culture.  The quartet's narrow-minded comments to King Julien and his entourage is compared to Californians having a P. Diddy party, which is understandable as it is all they know.<br /><br />Ultimately, Madagascar delivers comic relief to both young and old, even though this film will most likely be more entertaining to the younger viewers with its high level of slapstick humor.  Compared to other recent films with CGI animation Madagascar does not succeed in delivering an equally impressive storyline, yet it clearly finishes above an average cinematic experience.  There are both hits and misses within the story.  It is obvious that it will entertain an audience, but it misses a story with thorough substance from beginning to the end and it hurts the overall cinematic experience.erstandable as it is all they know. <br /> <br />Ultimately, Madagascar delivers comic relief to both young and old, even though this film will most likely be more entertaining to the younger viewers with its high level of slapstick humor.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is one of Madonna's best album and she's even put in a dedication for some of the reviewer's right here at Amazon.com (u know who u are sweeties). It goes something like this:<br /><br />\\"If you dont like my attatitude...<br /><br />WELL YOU CAN F-OFF<br /><br />just go to TEXAS<br /><br />isn't that where they golf\\"
B000B8QEZG|5.0|In The Evidence of Its Brilliance - NOT Give the evidence... <br /> <br />Madonna's Lyrics are clear Evidence of HER Brilliance - that's for sure. I rate seven of these tracks a 5 out of 5 and the rest a 4. Enough of them are a SEVEN to outweigh rating any part of this album worth passing on. This 47 year young icon is as fresh as she has ever been and hits another one out of the park. Her wisdom is really shining this time round. I don't think I will ever stop loving Madonna. She is such a reliable artist, there is no reason to believe she will ever disappoint. You can play this album over and over without getting tired of hearing each track again and again. If there are nay sayers about this album, they are not listening to her LYRICS. 2,4,7,8,9,11,12 is my playlist of the best set of tracks. The others I rate a 4 although I could live without Isaac for the most part. Thank you for a great early Christmas present Madonna. I love you.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Let me first start off by commenting on these negative comments being posted by these morons called \\"Team Lamb\\" who are basically a bunch of obsessed Mariah Carey fans who are posting negative reviews about Madonna and intend to contact radio stations and other outlets in an attempt to ruin sales of Confessions on a Dancefloor.   You people need to seriously get a life. It sounds like nothing more than a case of sour grapes to me.  People who are afraid that Madonna may receive some of the attention that she deserves with her current release.   God forbid if Mariah isn't number one on the charts for nine years straight!!  As far as your comments about positive reviews for Madonna being by \\"desperate\\" fans..apparently you haven't read Billboard, Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, People Magazine, etc. who have all posted positive reviews for Confessions on a Dance Floor.  These are all respected reviewers not \\"obsessed\\" fans posting positive reviews.  Get a life and find something constructive to do with your time like listening to We Belong Together over and over again until your ears bleed. The fact is Madonna has released a great album here and the attention she is receiving is well deserved.   23 years in the music industry and she is still one of the most innovative, unique and creative artists in music today.  Unlike Mariah Carey who turns out the same generic r+b songs over and over with a million rappers on them and has to re-release her album with a \\"new\\" song that is nothing more than a remake of We Belong Together. She is robbing her own fans of more money just so she can sell another million copies of the same cd she released in April.  <br /> <br />As far as Confessions on a Dance Floor goes, I have listened to this cd several times now and i can honestly tell you that this is one of Madonna's best albums.  Right up there with Ray of Light, Like a Prayer and Music.  I am not just some obsessed fan who will give anything Madonna does a 5-star review.  The truth is that aside from a few songs like Die Another Day, Nothing Fails and Mother and Father, I didn't care that much for American Life. It didn't seem like Madonna's heart was into that release.  But Confessions is a major return to form for her.  The production is solid and the tracks are all catchy and any of them could be potential hit singles.   The lead single Hung Up is a deliriously catchy dance track right up there with past dance hits like Holiday, Into the Groove, Vogue and Music. It's already number one on the dance charts and is continuing to grow at radio as it's single sales and digital downloads are strong and contine to grow.  The song will most likely end up in the top ten soon on Billboard's Hot 100 chart.  It has already hit number 1 on almost every other international chart across the world.  <br />Other favorites are Get Together, Sorry (the next single), I Love New York, Let It Will Be, Jump and Push. But all the tracks are great.  Isaac is beautiful and melodic and How High has a great 80's electro feel to it.  Future Lovers recalls classic Donna Summer and I Love New York has a punk feel to it inspired by Blondie hits like Call Me and Heart of Glass.  Speaking of the track Sorry again, this song has the potential to be one of Madonna's biggest hits in years. Just wait until it is remixed and sent to the clubs, it will be massive like Ray Of Light.  If you are a Madonna fan or a fan of dance music please pick up this release. You will not be disappointed.     <br />
1567184855|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Reading it was like coming home. It is a fascinating journey through death and back to the place that is home. There was nothing here I didn't already believe on some level, but this book helped to solidify and put into words what I have felt and been unable to articulate.  <br /> <br />I appreciate that the author really stayed neutral in his findings and didn't write the book as a new age sales pitch. He presents the facts of his sessions and pretty much leaves you to take it or leave it without pressure.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|If you have already purchased the Emancipation Of Mimi then save your money.  This re-release is nothing more than an opportunity to cash in on her success and suck more money out of the pockets of her loyal fans, some of whom will go to any length to 'promote' her even attempt to trash other artists.  That type of behavior is childish and the fact that these are people within Mariah's own fanclub just shows you what type of person she is.  A self-absorbed attention seeker who is more interested in her platinum certifications and number one singles than she is in her fans.  The fact that she also released this the same day as Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor is no coincidence. Well, it didn't work Mariah, because Madonna's new album is going to be a success and is expected to open at number one with sales of over 350,000 copies.  And Hung Up has jumped 13 spaces on the Hot 100 Singles chart and passed Don't Forget About Us.  Speaking of that song, Don't Forget About Us is nothing more than a rip-off of her own number one single We Belong Together and an attempt to suck more money out of her fans.  There were other potential hits on this cd already, such as Stay the Night and Mine Again.  She obviously wanted to release a \\"new\\" song so she can take more money from her fans who already bought the first cd.   If you already have this cd, SAVE YOUR MONEY.  Let the record labels know that they can't just repackage something and expect you to buy anything they throw at you.
0553801503|5.0|I have to say that I stumbled upon this series only in May, and therefore my wait for this book was not as painful as that of longtime fans. Perhaps that's why my rating is high. I enjoyed Feast as much as I enjoyed all of the previous three, and I was only disappointed by one aspect; the cliffhangers.  <br /> <br />In the previous books I felt like Mr. Martin resolved at least some of the issues that arose throughout the course of the respective novels, but in Feast it seemed like he didn't even make an effort in that respect. But, that's ok. I can wait.  <br /> <br />I wasn't terribly bothered by the fact that we only got half the characters, especially since he did such an incredible job with those represented in Feast. I could've done without the Greyjoy related chapters, but that's just a personal opinion. What little there was of Arya and Sansa still managed to be the highlights of this one for me, although Jaime and Brienne's chapters were right up there. Even Cersei was enjoyable. <br /> <br />Martin's writing still manages to engage me. I do have one bit of advice for him though. I'm pretty sick of the descriptor \\"airy confection.\\" I recalled that he used it in one or two of the earlier books, but I found it twice within a hundred pages or so in feast. I don't know why it irritates me, but it does.  <br /> <br />Pacing and characterization were on par with his previous efforts, and I felt like the surprises in this one were not gratuitous. Thankfully. Martin has the ability to shock, while making it a believable and natural part of the tale, and I appreciate the fact that he does not talk down to his readers. <br /> <br />Overall this is just an enjoyable book that of course leaves you wanting more, as has been said over and over again in these reviews.  <br /> <br />On a final note, I had read some of the reviews before starting this book, so I kind of knew I was not going to get very much resolution. Perhaps this awareness allowed me to enjoy it more forwhat it was, than I would have if I had read it full of expectation. <br /> <br />Recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|That is was Fox has done here...induced a very rare quality of show into a slumber.      There are 1,500 + reviews and i agree with every 5 star one of them.  But it's all been said before, i just want to show my support, so i'll keep this short...    The ONLY bad thing about this show is the feeling you get after you watch the last episode...it's sadness.  Such an amazing series, the characters, the editing quality, the cinematography, the stories, the laughs! just everything about this show screams quality.      I want this show back with new episodes...i want Firefly out of it's coma, because the show isn't dead...if there is enough support, i do believe it will return.  Think about Family Guy and you'll get the picture.    If you don't have this series on DVD and you enjoy quality entertainment...seriously, buy this DVD set and get Serenity on DVD when it comes out.  You won't be let down.    It is so rare now-a-day to get such a quality show and then for it to be taken away....    Bring Firefly back Fox!!!!!!

1559277734|5.0|I bought this book on CD to listen to on a long journey because I have read James Herriot and knew what I was getting with this book.  This recording is superb.  Christopher Timothy, who played James Herriot in the British television series, narrates and does a great job.  Some people simply read the book for these recordings; Timothy, however, adds personality and depth to each character and really brings the stories to life.  My whole family enjoyed listening and we have recommended it to several friends.
0684824906|4.0|The study of American History, particularly in political biographies like those written by Ms. Kerns Goodwin, enables one to understand (1) what a great nation we have created and (2) what made us so great.  Lincoln actually believed in the promise of the Declaration of Independence.  He believed in the United States of America.   <br /> <br />Ms. Kerns Goodwin's new biography of our country's greatest president demonstrates how Lincoln used his intellectual and political skills, as well as his moral strength, to preserve the union and the  idea of a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Reading Team of Rivals makes one proud to be an American. We are Americans today because of Abraham Lincoln.  <br /> <br />Kerns Goodwin's scholarship in this book is impeccable.  The 120 pages of endnotes of primary and secondary material will be treasured by historians for many years to come.  But she also writes a very readable story, accessible to the general public. This book on the political genius of Lincoln answers in the positive the question of \\"Do we really need another book on Lincoln?\\"   <br /> <br />Goodwin gives us a fresh view of Mr. Lincoln's incredible self-confidence, political acumen and self-sacrifice. Most importantly, she defines him with all his faults and mistakes by his greatest asset -- his leadership.  Lincoln could absorb a tremendous amount of criticism, some just some unjust, without taking it personally.  After reading this book one comes away with an even greater admiration of Mr. Lincoln.   <br /> <br />The literary device of telling the same story (Lincoln's life) through the eyes of four of his \\"rivals\\" is quite clever.  It allows a more comprehensive analysis of his presidency by opening up historical resources previously unavailable, such as the letters and journals of these rivals and their friends and families. <br /> <br />Kerns Goodwin's Lincoln is not a marble man. She fully exposes his weaknesses and mistakes.  She addresses how a man who loved liberty violated the constitution under the stress of war and how his views on racial equality were not only deficient by today's standards but fell far short of those of many in his own Republican party, including one of his rivals Salmon Chase.   <br /> <br />This book will not please contemporary confederate apologists or those who feel that Lincoln's racial views makes him unworthy of his high esteem in American History.  Ms. Kerns Goodwin's Lincoln is worthy of our admiration today because while he was not perfect, he was right in his essential core belief that the promise of the founders of our country could survive only under one united nation.    <br /> <br /> \\"Team of Rivals\\" contains a very good book, as its subtitle explains, on the political genius of Lincoln.  The only problem is that within its nearly 750 pages is a not so good book, an unsuccessful attempt to write mini-biographies of William Seward, Salmon Chase, Edwin Stanton and Edward Bates-a/k/a \\"the rivals.\\"  <br /> <br />The problem, and this is more than just a minor flaw, is that Goodwin's attempt to flesh-out the supporting cast of Seward, Chase, Stanton and Bates causes this political biography to sometimes go off course.  It makes the thread hard to follow.  Sort of like New Years Day trying to watch 3 or 4 football games at the same time.  No matter how hard you try, you sometimes get confused and wonder what the heck is going on.   <br /> <br />At times it seems Goodwin simply wrote the wrong book.  The good book about the political genius of Lincoln sometimes gets lost in this meandering work that includes too much about Chase's beautiful daughter or why Frances Stewart wanted to stay home instead of spending time in Washington.  I mean-why did I really have to know that Kate Chase's actions as a sixteen year old caused her boyfriend the governor of Rhode Island to back-off marriage.  What the heck was Ms. Kerns Goodwinthinking?  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, if you stay the course in reading this book, and I suggest you just skip through the E! Network stuff, it is a very enjoyable read.
0634049011|5.0|I recently got this and thumbed through it at first, not understanding why there were so many blank patterns.  Well, it's because it's a workbook.  Where as most guitar learning books I have purchased were 'read, play and apply', this is a book much like a school workbook, where it teaches you the lesson, and then tests you on what you learned.<br /><br />I wasn't sure how I felt about that approach at first, but I realized this is quite possibly the best way to learn it all like it needs to be learned.  The excercises tell you to talk out the actions while learning, and the test require you to write out what you've learned, which are two of the best tools for teaching and learning that can be utilized.<br /><br />I highly recommend the books for beginners or long time players that don't have a full understanding of the fretboard.  It's one thing to know what sounds good by playing it, it's another to know the names of the notes, chords and arpeggios as they are being played.
0156027321|5.0|Do you like stories about the struggle to survey impossible odds (and/or fables)?  If so, you'll like this book.   <br /> <br />I think that it's an excellent work of fiction.  Sure, there may be some problems with pacing and theme (specifically, with connecting the religious elements in the beginning to the end of the book), but that doesn't distract from the story. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the \\"twist\\" ending.  I think it only strengthens the story, in that the reader needs to rethink what he's just read. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm giving it a 4.5 (so that rounds up to a 5).  It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a read.   <br /> <br />By the way, the 1-star rated reviews seem so spiteful to me, like they were given by frustrated authors, squeamish Pollyannas, or religious bigots (Maybe a few people just didn't like or get this book ;)  ).   <br /> <br />I did not see any pretension in the novel.  Maybe those reviewers think that the line \\"This story will make you believe in God\\" is pretentious, but they don't say.  Maybe a better line would be \\"This story will make you believe in stories.\\"  People:  It's a line in a novel.  It's not a declaration of fact.  Jeez.   <br /> <br />Anyway, good books will always be divisive. <br /> <br />If you cannot stand a few descriptions of gore and violence or tentative explorations of religions other than your own, I suggest you stick with children's books, TV Guide, and your local newsletter.
B000BKJ78U|3.0|The only reason I am giving the widescreen a 3 star is because I bought the fullscreen last year and I miss out on buying the widescreen.  Of course I rectify that with buying the vhs copies but onto the matter at hand.  I don't see why Lucas is releasing these for it's the same stuff he released last year just without the bonus dvd which was excellant.  I guess if he fixed the exclusive content on each dvd would be plus.  Now if he released the originals on Dvd now that would be something to talk about.  I bet ten dollars that next year he will be releasing another box set probably the prequels and the original trilogy.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|After unleashing the worst album of her career on the public in the form of the cringe-inducing AMERICAN LIFE, Madonna returns to what she does best, that being pop music and more specifically dance music.  Clocking in at just under a literal non-stop hour, CONFESSIONS ON A DANCEFLOOR re-establishes Madonna as Queen of Clubs, thanks to a barrage of bouncy dance tracks that run the gamut from club stompers(\\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\") to the subtly sublime(\\"Get Together\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\"), with very few missteps.  First single \\"Hung Up\\", complete with its' genuis ABBA sample, is a fabulous intro, and the follow-up one-two punch of \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Sorry\\" complete a flawless opening salvo.  There is indeed some great tracks scattered among the rest of the set, though none approach the thrill of that initial trio.  And the singer's lyrical shortcomings become even more apparent on some of the less essential tracks, with some extremely trite lyrics really standing out(\\"sticks and stones will break my bones\\"...this coming from Madonna?!?). In fact, this is easily her most carefree, lyrically unchallenging album since her debut, with few songs mining the personal vein that she explored on LIKE A PRAYER, BEDTIME STORIES, or RAY OF LIGHT--though this is a thoroughly enjoyable album on many levels, die-hards proclaiming it her best should revisit the aforementioned three, all of which artistically supercede this . That said, any reason to make sure that any continuation of AMERICAN LIFE fails to see the light of day is reason enough to celebrate.  The fact that it's an overall great listen makes it all the better.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is Madonna's best work in years. Hung Up is a bona fide hit. This is a retro-future-techno-pop-dance record. Get Together is Madonna asking us to meet her on the dance floor in 20 minutes. Jump is gonna make you get up and dance. This album is mellow or dance, depending on the volume level. It's amazing. Push has a great beat to it that is infectious! I Love New York, although having quirky lyrics is an excellent homage to the city closest to her heart and where she got \\"discovered\\". This record is pure Madonna returning to her dance club roots and doing an excellent job with Stuart Price her cohort in Dance Floor Crime! Buy this record and you will be pleasantly surprised at all the gems on Confessions!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This CD is Great!!!! I have been waiting to hear music like this!!! Madonna you are great! Thank you for the music! I love \\"Let's get together\\" and \\"push\\". This CD is the best!!!! <br />~~~ToNy~~~
B00007CVSH|4.0|I bought this  DVD on a complete whim last week, and I'm VERY glad I indulged. Trovatore has been one of my favorite operas for ages.  Visually (except in some cases noted below) this set has very high audio and visual production values. All the principal's performances work well on the dramatic level, and most of the time, on the vocal level, as well. And except for a few places, discussed below, the staging was excellent. In the last scene, it was a nice realistic touch that both Manrico and Azucena look as if they'd been roughed up.  <br /> <br />   My ideal Manrico would have the looks and acting ability of Jose Cura and Pavarotti's voice and technique as it was in his prime. I found Cura's voice good and pleasant in the more melodic passages, but he does lack some of Pavarotti's technical finesse. There were rough patches in Cura's singing, notably in Di Quella Pira, but I enjoyed Ah Si Ben Mio.  On the positive side of the balance sheet, Jose Cura definitely looks the part, and you don't have to wonder what Leonora sees in him. He concentrates on and responds well to the other Principals, which I liked. Cura and Villaroel are believable as the lovers for the most part, they stay close together on stage, and their love scenes have real tenderness. I liked it that Manrico and the Count go at each other with swords as if they really mean it. In some operatic duels, the swordsmen give you the impression they might as well be waving tennis rackets.  But those two show their characters are real rivals in love and can barely be in the same room, together without fighting.     <br /> <br /> Dmitri Hvorostovsky  as Count di Luna is a worthy rival for Leonora, and his singing is superb. He can sing Il Balen to me ANY time! Like Jose Cura, he really gets absorbed in his part, he looks at and sings to the other cast members, and when he fights, he doesn't hold back. His romantic frustration pushes him farther and farther beyond reason, but I couldn't help feeling sorryfor him.  You could see him thinking \\"What is WRONG with this girl, to go after a gypsy, and why can't I make her love me?\\" Given all that he has to offer, one has to wonder if he made some terrible blunder with Leonora early that completely turned her off him. At the end after he shoots Manrico, it was a nice touch that he goes over to Manrico and holds his body in his arms-something that isn't possible with the more traditional staging of Manrico being beheaded offstage. <br /> <br /> Yvonne Naef makes a good Azucena, and she and Cura have good stage rapport. Manrico is a loving son in the prison scene at the end. The only real complaint I have is that Naef looks younger than the Count, and more like Manrico's sister than his mother. I would like a bit more power in her lower range, but it's still a good performance. I just confess I have a hard time taking Azucena's mistake of throwing her own child into the fire seriously. I really have to suspend my disbelief for that one. <br /> <br />Vocally, Veronica Villaroel is the weak link, but she certainly acts the part of Leonora with conviction, and looks the part, as well.  It's plausible that she could have two attractive young men fighting over her. She was better in the ensemble parts than in her solo moments, as her voice lacks the sheer beauty needed for this part, although it is not unpleasant. Tacea la Notte went better than D'Amor Sul allee rosee. Villaroel struggled with the high notes and coloratura, but did very well in the Miserere and Tu Vedrai. And she really digs into her fourth act duet with the Count with passion.  She interacted well with both her male leads.  I just wish she hadn't kept getting up and walking away from Manrico in Act III-it's one of the few happy moments they have together and it doesn't last long. Why did she keep getting up and moving away from him?  <br /> <br />The reason for the 4 stars is because of the production. Placing the action in 19th century Italy doesn't ruin Trovatore, but it doesn't add much, either.  The few anachronisms of the different time setting such as Leonora singing of tournaments in the 19th century does not make the opera all that much sillier.  The Count and Manrico carrying pistols as WELL as swords is a bit more problematic. Why do they need the swords if they can just shoot each other?  But since sword-play is dramatically important to the plot, they should have left out the pistols.   <br />     In an opera that has nothing to do with sailing or ships, why is Count di Luna dressed like an admiral?  Also, Hvorostovsky's gray hair made him look significantly older than the other principals. I just wish he had worn a dark wig instead to make him look nearer Manrico's  age.  <br />      Most of the staging was effective, but I did not care for Azucena's near rape in Count di Luna's camp in Act 3.  Tasteless and unnecessary. Also did not like Manrico's cigar-what does a singer need with a cigar????? Ugh! <br />   Leonora's death scene is also awkward.  After his tenderness to her in Act III, couldn't Manrico get up and greet Leonora properly when she comes in? When he finally realizes she's dying, he does go and take her in his arms and give her some love, but they remain standing until the very last moment. He couldn't ease her gracefully to the floor, instead?  <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's the best album of the year!  I'm absolutely in love with every song!  If you like great music and like to dance, then this is the CD for you.
0525948023|5.0|Have read the negative reviews from those who compare this book to The Power of Now.  Visit Eckhart Tolles website, I believe the author gives honest advise on his site suggesting facts to consider before buying the new book if you have already read The Power of Now. (Thanks Mr. Tolle for your honest advise.)  We did not buy the new book based on this but later read a friends copy and found his own websites advise true. Reading the new book on it's own merits we rate it 5 but would rate it 4 if compared to The Power of Now.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Tracks like \\"American Idiot\\" makes me hop out of my chair and dance. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" makes me cry. \\"Wake Me When Sept Ends\\" and \\"We Are the Waiting\\" make me sway to the music. No matter what this CD makes you want to do, it's genuine music in a shallow world.
B000002BMV|5.0|<br />If you think Steve Perry has a great voice, it has NEVER sounded better than on Escape!   <br />That is just one reason why Escape is Journey's best album.  <br /> <br />Here are the other reasons:  <br />Escape has their best songwriting. (Jonathan Cain's first album with the band) <br />Escape is their best musical performance as a band. (the sound of the instruments, etc.) <br />Escape contains no \\"filler\\" songs (though \\"Dead Or Alive\\" is weaker than the rest). <br /> <br />Journey is my favorite band.  I own ALL of their albums, and I can say without any doubt that Escape is their best.   <br />If you are going to buy any of their albums, this is THE ONE!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|22 years after she first graced the dance floor, Madonna is sending you an invitation to get into the groove again. And if Confessions is anything to go by, she shows the world that she still can dance as well as inspire.<br /><br />Working with her new partners, most notably the savvy Stuart Price, Confessions is a 12-track segued mix of dance ecstasy. Lead single, Hung Up, amazingly mixes Abba's 1979 hit Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight) with Madonna's and Price's retro-disco fluffiness into a bonafide dance floor anthem. Follow this with the throbs of the electro-futuristic Get Together where Madonna makes you check it out with her as she really wants to be with you. Then, the song fades cleverly into Madonna saying sorry in a few languages before she sends you to gyrate along with Sorry. On Forbidden Love, Madonna morphs into Giorgio Moroder and creates a superb 80s-sounding yet stylish song of two star-crossed lovers. On the Indian-inspired, beats-driven Push, Madonna pays tribute to the one (presumably Guy Ritchie)who has constantly pushed her to her best.<br /><br />On Confessions, Madonna's lyrics are never overly self-indulgent though short of any major revelations that we don't already know. There are self-discovery, enlightenment, empowerment, love, and lament.<br /><br />Confessions is a true return to form for the Queen of Pop, something all fans have been eagerly waiting for.<br /><br />(PS: If you want the tracks individually with start and end as opposed to mixed togther, iTunes is the only place you can find them. The individual tracks bring a different feel to them.)
B000B8QEZG|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER!! EVERY SONG STIMULATES A DIFFERENT MOOD, BUT ALL IN ALL I JUST WANT TO DANCE!!!!  A MUST GET ALBUM.
B00007G207|5.0|This is is a fantastic movie. I think it is simply amazing to watch the journey of Salvatorre from the young Toto to the middle aged director. I also feel this film shows the reality of true love. It can often be difficult and comes with great sacrifice. This is not your typical, hackneyed hollywood love story. I also feel that Alfredo is another wonderful character, he is more than the sage mentor. I would go on more, but I do not want to give too much away. This is a movie of passion, longing, and its simply brilliant from start to finish. I implore you to see this as soon as possible.
0307263118|5.0|Just because a book wins the Booker Prize doesn't mean it's great; I have found the award to be pretty hit and miss in recent years.  But \\"The Sea\\" is just stunning, mainly because of the absolutely perfect writing.  Rarely a handful of pages goes by before I find myself breathless and wanting to re-read a sentnece or a paragraph just for its beauty and insight.   If great writing is not your bag, the story itself may not be enough to carry you along, but if you appreciate the crafting of language and reading a master in action, then this is not to be missed.  I won't forget this book quickly.  Bravo Mr Banville.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|It is impossible to approach a new Madonna album without, however unjustly, comparing it to her past successes and accomplishments. With that said, \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is her most cohesive album since \\"Ray of Light\\" and, as one continuous mix, gives a big middle finger to the single minded, iPod shuffle culture we live in today. It is meant to be an experience and, with hardly a clunker in sight, one Hell of an experience it is. Where \\"American Life\\" felt raw, almost unfinished (and quite honestly a bit preachy and lyrically challenged), Confessions is touted as a return to her dance routes (as if she ever really left it). Under Stuart Price's overall production, songs like \\"Get Together,\\" \\"Future Lovers,\\"  and \\"Forbidden Love\\" are sexy, trippy, all-out club beats with layers upon layers of sounds and samples that should make even the most rigid person sway in their seat. <br /> <br />Just like the woman who once showed us how to \\"Express Yourself\\", this is a self confident Madonna as she proclaims in the standout track, \\"Sorry,\\" \\"I've heard it all before and I can take care of myself\\" or on the defiant closer, \\"Like It or Not,\\" \\"You can love me/or leave me/cause I'm never gonna stop.\\"   \\"Jump,\\" another single-worthy track, with its call to family and soulful singing voice harks back to the innocence of \\"Keep It Together\\". And only Madonna, with a wink and a nod, could produce the childish lyrics of \\"I Love New York\\" and get away with it, almost. <br /> <br />But, it is not all the light and fluffy fare as the first single \\"Hung Up\\" and recent interviews would have you believe.  \\"Isaac,\\" the closest thing that comes to a ballad and with obvious Kabbalah overtones, is a lush world music duet not so dissimilar to Sting's \\"Desert Rose \\". In \\"How High\\" and \\"Let It Will Be\\" she muses on the perils of fame and fortune, themes she has dealt with on every album since \\"Ray of Light\\", but never as eloquent as \\"Drowned World (Substitute For Love)\\". I believe she issincere is her quest to seek answers and these songs are catchier than \\"American Life\\" but, it is time to move on. <br /> <br />Much has been made of Madonna's skill at \\"re-invention\\" but little attention has been devoted to her skill as a songwriter. With each album (and each new producer) she not only has managed to maintain her sense of self but there is also a clear progression.  Although \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" lacks the iconic perfect marriage between craft and emotion of \\"Like a Prayer\\" or \\"Ray of Light,\\" it still leaves me agasp, wondering what Madonna could possibly do next.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|If you want a true 'emancipation' of an artist, coupled with astonishingly good beats, then simply purchase Madonna's latest album 'Confessions On A Dance Floor'. Mariah is as manufactured as they get, and is constantly looking for street cred, which she simply doesn't have. She has only slightly changed her style once, in her entire career, and likes to stick to the formula. Where's the creativity in that.    Further more, she is ripping oiff her fans with this 'deluxe edition'. I mean, is she had all these extra 'good' songs from the beginning, why not place them on the album initially. Why wait and make fans dip into their wallets twice. That is greed, and it shouldn't be tolerated. BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE
B00006FM77|5.0|I used to have the original Columbia cd release and immediately got rid of it because the quality was horrible.  When i found out Rhino was re-releasing this I decided to give a second a chance and I'm glad i did.  The sound quality is far superior than the columbia original.  On the re-issue you can truly appreciate how great of a guitarist Terry Kath was and how great the horn section is.  The bonus disc of alternate versions/unreleased songs is a nice edition.  I prefer the version of Introduction on disc 4 the version on disc 2.  If you're a big fan of old Chicago this collection is a must.

When Mr. Cash died he left a legend, and a collection of great music with his signiture of approval in every one.  This album is deffinatly worth listening to, over and over.  It's a \\"must own\\" album!
B000AJJNOK|1.0|This album, and the subsequent success of it, represnts the moral and social break-down of our society. How can we, as individuals of society, allow such a talent-less wannabe rapper become so successful, simply because he was a drug dealer who got shot nine times. Fine, if the music actually had substance, I would understnad, but it simply doesn't. The tracks all sound the same, in their profane, mysoginistic and voilent way. 50 cent simply doesn't have the interllectual capability to write anything slighlty meaningful or sinifcant, and will hopefully be forgotten with tomorrow's waste. He is probably the most brain numb rapper out there. <br /> <br />A good beat does not justify an album's existence. This is ghetto trash, which shouldn't be glorified, or worse, brought into our own homes.  <br /> <br />For real rap music, with meaning, purchase LIL KIM's new album 'The Naked Truth'.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna has never been the best singer, but what makes her music great is the production.  This record is the brilliant dance music, plain and simple.  I love it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This must be the most under appreciated albukm of madonna's career, and will always be remembered as artistic pinnacle of Madonna's career. The media, Critics and some fans could not deal with the fact that madonna had something to say, and had an opinion she wished to express. I believe that this album was more experimental than Ray Of Light, and was more of a journey of inner-questioning for Madonna. She questions the material world, as well as the mind's connection to the illusions offered by it. She questions her place in the superficial world, and wonders whether it was all worth it. This album isn't overtly poltical in it's content, but more in the images it presents to the listener. To me, it was madonna being more defiant than ever, and for that, this album is better for it. <br /> <br />Casual madonna listner's should steer clear of this, but real fans and people who have been with madonna from the beginning, will find much to appreciate here. Honest, confronting and at times challenging, American Life belongs in the collection of any true Madonna Fan, and Music fans alike, who appreciates envoloping and honest Music.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Ist of all, this is only the 2nd time this cd has been released. Not the 3rd or 4th like some are saying. When It 1st came out you could buy it with a poster or not. The cd itself was exactly the same. Same thing this time but with the choice of a dvd or not. As far as the music goes. I love all the songs with the exception of I WISH YOU KNEW. Hasnt grown on me yet. Now onto Madonna. Im not going to hate on madonnas cd. I actually kinda like it. But to her fans saying how Mariah is greedy for re-releasing her cd. Maybe you should take a look and see. Madonnas cd is being re-released only 1 month after its initial release.

B0002OERI0|3.0|I associate the band Green Day with middle school.  Back in 8th grade these guys ruled the world.  So when I heard they were putting out a rock opera with 8 minute suites, I was definitely skepitical.  Despite good reviews and press I decided not to buy American Idiot. <br /> <br />Eventually I got a burned copy of this cd, and is it as good as the hype machine would have you believe?  Well, no it's not.  But it's not a bad record.  American Idiot is a concept album, complete with characters like the Jesus of Suburbia and St. Jimmy.  It paints in broad thematic strokes, with lyrics critical of George W. Bush, the religious right and the suburban lifestyle.  Musically, it isn't really punk, at least not all of it.  It runs stylistically from punk like the title song, to modern rock power ballads like Boulevard of Broken Dreams, to schmaltzy and sentimental songs like Wake Me Up When September Ends.   <br /> <br />This album is inspired by The Who and their rock operas.  The two suites, The Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming: The Death of St. Jimmy, are emblematic of A Quick One.  They lift the idea of religious symbolism from Tommy.  They even borrow a bit from the Flaming Lips with Give Me Novacaine.   <br /> <br />So does American Idiot take it's place next to great concept albums like Sgt. Pepper, Dark Side of the Moon, and OK Computer?  No, not even close.  Does it stand up next to ambitious alternative and punk records like London Calling, Zen Arcade, or Double Nickels on the Dime?  Again, American Idiot isn't in the same league as those great albums. <br /> <br />Basically American Idiot is an ambitious record from a band who is limited musically.  I applaud the effort, but I don't think that American Idiot completely gels as a concept.  I would recommend buying Tommy by The Who or getting London Calling by The Clash to get some perspective on where this album came from.  Overall it's a solid album, but it's not a great album like all of the Green Day fans wouldhave you believe
0684833395|5.0|Catch 22 is a novel that is and deserves to be a cornerstone of american literature.

B000063DFN|5.0|THE BAND: Steve Harris (bass), Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Nicko McBrain (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1984) 8 tracks clocking in at approximately 51 minutes. This is their 5th album in 5 years. Recorded at Compass Point in Nassau, Bahamas. The disc contains an 18-page booklet with a brief intro, lyrics, band pictures and thank you's. All songs written by Harris and/or Dickinson (with Smith co-writing one). The enhanced CD features a nice multimedia section for your PC - including 2 videos (\\"Aces High\\" and \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\"), the band's catalogue of albums, band history, family tree, itinerary from the '84-'85 World Slavery Tour, and more. Digitally remastered in 1998. Cover art by the one and only Derek Riggs.<br /><br />COMMENTS: It's hard to top this release from Iron Maiden. In my opinion, it sits up on that same lofty shelf with \\"Number Of The Beast\\" and \\"Piece Of Mind\\". \\"Powerslave\\" was Maiden's 3rd monster album in a row and it solidified them as the best metal act of the time. The title track is a classic and it's one of my favorite Dickinson penned tunes, ever. The 13+ minute \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" is a marathon of a song, and perhaps the band's all-time exemplary magnum opus. \\"Aces High\\" and \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\" were two of the band's higher ranking chart hits - and simply fast paced classic Maiden tunes. \\"Losfer Words\\" is a hard hitting instrumental (their first since \\"Genghis Khan\\" from their \\"Killers\\" album in 1981). The only song I give less than a perfect score is \\"Back In The Village\\" (a good song, but the least memorable on such a flawless album). I've been to many concerts and one of the stand-outs is Maiden at Radio City Music Hall in NYC (January '85)... 4 sold-out nights in a row (would have been 7 nights had Bruce not been sick). If I'm reaching for some classic old-school longhaired metal, or one of my favorite Iron Maiden albums, \\"Powerslave\\" is absolutely one of the first ones I choose. The band was never better than they were here on \\"Powerslave\\". Great disc.as never better than they were here on \\"Powerslave\\". Great disc.

Digitally remastered in 1998. Cover art by the one and only Derek Riggs.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Piece Of Mind\\" and \\"Number Of The Beast\\" are my 3 favorite Maiden albums. \\"Somewhere In Time\\" is a great release, but I put it on that 2nd tier of Maiden discs - along with \\"7th Son\\", \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"Killers\\". Close at 5-stars, but not quite. But since I can't rate it at 4.5, 5 will have to do here... only because a very good album from Maiden is still light years ahead of so much of the other crap that's out there (past and present). Prior to \\"Somewhere\\" Maiden had released 5 albums in 5 years. Extensive touring for the \\"Powerslave\\" tour followed by some much needed time off pushed this release back a year to 1986. I also read that at the time, this was their most expensive and most time consuming album to date (many tracks were rehashed and then hashed again). \\"Wasted Years\\" is my favorite song on the disc and perhaps my all-time favorite song penned by guitarist Adrian Smith. \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" and the 8+ minute \\"Alexander The Great\\" are simply classic hard driving metal songs that only Iron Maiden could deliver. Though a decent song, \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" is in my opinion the weakest song here. With Maiden's previous 3 albums being so strong, I'd go so far as saying this is my least favorite song the band has put out in 5 years. Also new on \\"Somewhere\\" was the introduction of the bass and guitar 'Synth' - giving the entire album a slightly different feel. The only other comment I can make is - where did Bruce Dickinson disappear to on the writing credits? All the albums he's appeared on with Maiden he's always written or at least shared in the writing of their songs. No credits for Bruce here. Not sure why - his solo career was years away in the mid 90's. The band pictures of the group sitting in that futuristic blue car are pure cheese. \\"Somewhere In Time\\" ranks 4th on my list of favorites from Maiden. And, still very much essential to the music library.he weakest song here.

0553801503|1.0|It happens to the best of them.  Any fan of the fantasy genre knows that at one point, a magical series loses... well.... the magic!  It happened to The Wheel of Time, it's happening to Harry Potter, and it looks like George R.R. Martin has finally hit the roadblock that strikes most fantasy authors when they can't wrap the series up in a few novels.   <br /> <br />Not that I wanted A Song of Ice and Fire to end, but I think we all knew something was up.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I present to you the evidence: <br /> <br />1. Martin had once promised a set number of books in the series, but that number was blurred as he gained more fame.   <br />2. He actually wrote this book years ago but threw it away because he didn't like it.   <br />3. He had originally intended to age the main characters after book three but didn't think it worked well enough and changed the entire layout of his world. <br />4. Delay after delay, promise after promise on his website, and after five years we FINALLY have a new book.  <br /> <br />So honestly, after all these troubles, did anyone not see this potential disaster driving straight towards us? <br /> <br />Before I tuck my head in and cry myself to sleep because another one of my favorite fantasy series has soiled its pants, I just wanted to respond to the people who jusify Martin's ommission of our favorite characters in this book on the grounds that book four is the first half of a giant novel.  Newsflash!  Even J.R.R. Tolkien never left Frodo or Aragorn out of a Lord of the Rings novel, even though that book was also originally supposed to be one huge novel that was instead split into three books because the publishers thought it would sell better.  <br /> <br />If you want another fantasy series, my advice is to read Robin Hobb and her Farseer Trilogy.  I actually discovered her by reading Martin's recommendations at his website.  Hobb's series has suddenly replaced Martin's series as one of my all-time faves only because of this stinker of a 4th book!
B00004X01U|5.0|Welcome to TeamLamb, an organized team of Mariah Carey fans. Our purpose is to keep Mariah, the biggest female musical icon of all time, on top.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the no-talent ****, Madonna, is still being referred to as the \\"Queen of Pop,\\" even though her most recent album, American Life, and her Reinvention Tour have really made her the \\"Queen of Flops.\\" Madonna used to be successful, but that's because she slept her way to the top. Mariah, on the other hand, has sold millions of records based solely on her amazing talents and being a great role model.  <br /> <br />Mariah has had sixteen number one singles. Her last two number one singles, \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" have broken worldwide records everywhere. Mariah's most recent Charmbracelet tour was a critically acclaimed smash that played to millions all over the world. Roger Friedman, a well respected music journalist, called the concert one of the greatest he's seen in the past ten years. Mariah is, indeed, the biggest musical sensation since the Beatles.  <br /> <br />Within the next couple months, Madonna will try to take away Mariah's crown by releasing \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" along with the single, \\"Hung Up.\\" There seems to be a lot of buzz , but most of it seems generated by Madonna's desperate, pathetic fans. TeamLamb will do everything we can to make this project a flop for Madonna. We will organize by calling radio stations and telling them how much we don't like her new songs, write letters to several magazines and confirm that she is, indeed, over, and spread negative messages about Madonna on several Internet blogs.
055380457X|5.0|I have always been interested in Google (who isn't?) and I loved this book.  There is a great deal of information but it's presented as a fun, fast-moving story.  As a business student I was drawn to chapters about how the founders are motivated by a lot more than making money, and I enjoyed learning about all of the cool things they have planned for the future.  But the book is worth getting just for the entertaining chapters on Charlie the Chef and the Googleplex!
0307276902|5.0|I have never felt the urge to write a review of a book until I finished this book. <br /> <br />I could not put this book down - and even days after finishing it - I am still thinking about what I read and how this man managed to stay alive. <br /> <br />I gasped when I read the last page - I have to read My Friend Leonard Now <br /> <br />Thank you so much James Frey for affecting me like this
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Ok, I tried to understand. I listened to the album several times before i pass judgement but unfortunately it did not work. This is a lame album compared to American Life and Ray of Light.  <br /> <br />I always have high hopes when it comes to her album but i was quite dissapointed with this one. Why? She sounded like a trying hard Kylie Minogue or a Sophie Ellis Bextor wannabe.  <br /> <br />The tracks:  <br /> <br />Hung Up- ripped the first part of Gimme Gimme Gimme by Abba. Great Idea, bad lyrics.  <br /> <br />Get Together- is this Love At First Sight part 2? .. <br /> <br />Sorry- this sounded like an old Erasure song <br /> <br />and so on and so forth... Final judgement? Forget About this album. Look for other albums instead.  <br /> <br />
B000BJS4OY|4.0|The album sounds better than ever, but this show is awesome.  I just love the fact that someone recorded in grainy 16mm and 24 track audio.  I felt like I was in London watching as they played...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is a masterpiece of work.   Madonna has went above and beyond with this album.   I have been waiting a long time for Madonna to put a complete dance album out and it has arrived. I love that all the music runs together without a miss of a beat.   Way to go Madonna!!
0962477060|5.0|I am a beginning guitarist who has been taking lessons weekly for the past 4 months.  I have played my guitar every single day since I bought it (the term \\"played\\" is used loosely) and I picked up this book at Guitar Center just for something to read.  I have never been as excited about playing guitar as I was 20 minutes into the book.  It was like a light bulb suddenly switched on in my head.   <br /> <br />This book is so logical and concise in it's concepts that I can see exactly what I am doing and where I need to go next.  I have just finished reading part I and need to spend hours and hours practicing the concepts I just read so that I know all of the forms, scales and runs but for someone that is very mathematically oriented like me, I love the fact that I now have a plan on how to attack learning the guitar.  I'm excited because I can see that using this system, I will be able to know which note/chord I am playing anywhere on the fretboard as well as what lies around it.  This book just shaved years off of my learning curve.  I think it was helpful to already have 4 months of lessons under my belt because I already knew some of the basics, this book just helped show me how all of the random pieces I have been working on fit together. <br /> <br />While there is no holy grail and I am not going to become Clapton overnight, this book is definitely worth it's weight in gold to a newbie.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Queen Live At Wembely Stadium is Queen's greatest performance live. I don't know how Freddie Mercury can keep singing. All your favourite Queen songs are here. This DVD includes all of Queen's famous songs to the ones that never took the limelight as much as say Bohemian Rhapsody. It doesn't stop there either. <br /> <br />Special features are the second disc and it shows you why they decided to play at Wembley and exclusive interviews with Roger Taylor and Brian May and some with Freddie Mercury and John Deacon. <br /> <br />So go get this DVD and relive Queen at Wembley Stadium! <br /> <br />Jake Potts

0307263118|5.0|Much of the criticism of this wonderful book accuses Banville of being pretentious, his language overblown.  But that is to miss the point of the style.  Mr. Banville respects his readers and doesn't dumb down his prose.  His narrator Max uses obscure words because he is a writer and is himself fascinated by words.  In one case, almost as an aside, Max admires a particularly well used word.  Like Graham Swift, Banville makes the reader stretch his mental muscles.  And get rewarded.    This book is a reverie, an internal meander through the past, near and far.  The present kindles memories of his recent devastation, which leads to a pivotal summer from the past, which leads to his family's history, which leads back to the present.  And with a logical twist in the final pages.  I loved this book and was so glad when it won the Booker.  He was due.
B0009QBLA8|4.0|An experimental horror film that's almost impossible to describe. The nightmare world of slimy creatures, freakish babies, and a weird woman who lives in the radiator all combine with the \\"real\\" world until there is no separation.<br /><br />Filmed in b&w with a minimum amount of lighting, in a dilapidated building where time seems to have stopped, the movie violates our senses with strange, unreal imagery and odd sounds - banging steam pipes, whimperings, eerie sound effects.<br /><br />It's \\"about\\" nothing so it's not interested in what we think, just in what we feel. We DO feel creepy and lost in an alien (though still somewhat familiar) nightmare world, but because it has no \\"meaning\\" (something our thought processes can chew on) we are also lost just to our senses and eventually just plain lost. It can't help but feel pretentious at times, a set up - but just at times. The soundtrack, with the strange noises and pipe organ music (by Fats Waller!) is the most impressive thing here. This is David Lynch's view of life on that infinitely fine line between the real world and the \\"other.\\" Amazin'.
0307263118|5.0|Middle aged Irishman Max Morden mourns deeply the loss of his wife Anna.  Needing to escape the overwhelming memories and though fifty years have passed since he has been there, Max retreats to the Cedars, a house that was the summer home of the Graces, who strongly influenced him when he was a child.  He takes a room there hiding from his normal now dispirited life.<br /><br />Max thinks back to that summer when the affluent Graces vacationed at the Cedars.  They \\"adopted\\" him as their personal waif for those glorious months.  Though the parents, the authoritative father and the real family ruler the mother treated him nicely, the twin daughters Chloe and Myles were his connection.  He compares that time with the lingering illness until death do us part of his spouse and his daughter Claire.  Worried about her dad, Claire tries to help Max overcome his depression; but he wants to sink deeper into the past when death was something adults dealt with and youngsters like him blithely played all day without a care in the world.<br /><br />THE SEA runs fathoms deep as the audience obtains a remarkable character study that focuses on an individual who in spite of expecting the Grim Reaper to call cannot cope when the visit occurs.  Max is morbid and melancholy as he mourns his loss and cannot cope with it; while his daughter can readily see his angst but has no concept on how to return her dad to the living.  Readers will sympathize with Max, but wonder whether the past will engulf his present and future or will he realize those idyllic days had woes too that his memories chose to discriminately ignore.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00005JNX0|1.0|There are a lot of good cartoon movies out there. <br />This one is just another rehash of the same ideas. <br />Try renting before buying.
B00003XB8K|4.0|Enigma has continued to be a favorite. With the release of each subsequent work I find new reason to enjoy the music.  Screen Behind The Mirror took me a few listenings to warm up to its feel.  However, now I find it difficult to put down.  Being a fan of Orff's work helps and the samplings of Carmina Burana add an interesting flavor to each track where they appear.  My recommendation would be to listen long and hard before discounting this one.  Let it play in the background while you go about other chores.  You'll soon find yourself enjoying it more than you believed possible.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|The pictures of Madonna are great, she looks really good and she put a great deal of time and energy into making the pictures look great. <br /> <br />But the music is sad.  And its not dance music, its sit and listen blues music.  The \\"Hung Up\\" is a 'decent' dance song, but not like her \\"Over & Over\\" or \\"Burning Up\\".  The rest of the album is very trancy, dubby monotonic songs.  Maybe her voice is gone and she has to use 'gimmic' synths to make it.  I don't know.  But it is far below her standards.  She has done many incredible dance songs.  <br /> <br />But Madonna, this is not dance music!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|No doubt this CD will get alcolades of praise from everyone, everywhere, but I had to put in my thoughts.  It is perfect.  That is all. Perfect.  Every song, every beat, every sound, everything.  I am loving Hung Up and Forbidden Love the most, but NY, Let It Will Be and the rest are all fantastic as well. Personally, I think this is Madonna's best yet.  Certainly a great comeback from the tepid American Life.  Thank you, Madonna!
B000A2H812|4.0|Gogol Bordello played at Van's Warped Tour.  I can't believe that.  I don't like most Warped Tour bands, but I just can't believe that Gogol didn't get booed of the stage.  It would seem like Warped Tour's emo kids would strongly dislike Gogol's bizarre mix of punk, gypsy music, reggae & ska, house, and psychedelia.  Whatever.  But Gogol Bordello is the most original and refreshing band I have heard in a long time.  This is one of my new favorite bands.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|One word: Amazing. Not since \\"Ray of Light\\" have I been so enamored with Madonna's music. From the album's beginning to its end, I have no other desire than to get up and dance the entire night away! Hearing the single \\"Hung Up\\" restored my faith in Madonna as I was slightly disappointed with the material on \\"Music\\" and \\"American Life.\\" In sum, \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a tour de force! Baby, put your dancing shoes on!!!
B000B8QEZG|3.0|When you stack up Madonna's Latest \\"Confessions on the Dance Floor\\" it really does fall somewhere in the middle! I feel this cd will be one of her least memorable releases! The Cd is Okay, has some standout tracks but I feel that Madonna is Showing her age and she just isnt as Innovative as she used to be. I love the single Hung Up BUT I am not a fan of using other songs(ABBA Song) to promote a Song, just smacks of laziness to me. There are Two really HORRIBLE SONGS on The Cd, \\"I love new york\\" sounds like it was written by Madonna when she was in the 6th grade and that Song \\"Issac\\" just Unlistenable. Many of the songs sounded alike to me. I will say that I listened to the entire cd twice and it sounds better on the second listen . Still, I miss the Old madonna which is the problem, as madonna gets older, she loses the spunk and Spirit of the old Madonna. For example, in the song \\"I Love New York\\" madonna states, \\"if you dont like my attitude then F Off\\", well, the old Madonna just would have come out and said the word! its an okay cd, worth a listen but nothing special.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Listen, I've been looking at cds on Amazon and reading reviews for a while, and I've decided to say something that I feel needed to be said a loooong time ago. IF YOU DO NOT OWN THE ALBUM, DO NOT WRITE A REVIEW! I can't tell you how many times I've been on Amazon and seen reviews by people that have nothing else to do but bitch about bands they don't like. You people disgust me. So your favorite bands are Obituary and Napalm Death, that does not mean you need to go online and write about how much you hate Good Charlotte. Like the idiot below me, who obviously isn't a big fan of \\"nu metal\\".Yes you're very clever, no one's ever written a review sarcastically. Just shut the hell up. If you've ever reviewed a Limp Bizkit album and intentionally misspelled words, guess what, you're a moron, and I despise you.  <br /> <br />Now that I've said what I had to say, this is actually a pretty good album. \\"Slipknot have 'sold out'\\", bitch bitch bitch.  <br />They proved that there's more to their music than distorted guitars and screaming. Why that's so horrible...I don't know. <br />Anyway that's all I have to say. <br /> <br />Oh P.S. Learn to spell you dumb bastards.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not here to convince anyone to buy this, but just to join in on the collective praise. Nearly every episode had something so funny that I just had to laugh out loud even though I was alone. I think besides the terrific characters, the cinematography is owed a thanks for this. Whether enjoying the witty dialogue or the action, the camera always moves fluidly like you're there. I think its what brought me in and made me the 10th crew member aboard this amazing ship (which has been deemed by a DVD extra feature as the 9th crew member) you can't help but love. In fact, I enjoyed it and laughed more the second time, and plan on going through it again before the dvd comes out.
0553801503|3.0|I truly loved the first three books and looked forward to the release of this one.  I was sooooo disappointed.  I found it to be an o.k. read but it certainly lacked the luster of the first three.  I can only hope he is setting up for major things to come in the next one.  But if the next one is as bad as this one, so be it I will just have to wash my hands of GRRM. <br /> <br />\\"I really hated the introduction of the new characters without being properly updated with ALL of the characters the first three books were about, and several of the original characters were barely mentioned\\" <br /> <br />Last but not least \\"WHERE'S THE DRAGONS?\\" <br />
B000B8QEZG|4.0|The first three songs of the album are great, upbeat and just about phenomenal. Unfortunately, with a a few exceptions, the rest of the album's songs don't stand out. This is not to say they are not good- they just aren't as catchy as the first three. Sometimes, the corny lyrics mess up otherwise fun beats- such as 'sticks and stones... your words will never hurt me' or as in I Love New York she sings \\"'F' Off\\". Literally, the letter F followed by Off. I guess what I am getting to is that some of the lyrics are nothing more than playground fodder (or whatever)! That being said, she does do some interesting things with some of the other songs, such as the chanting in Isaac her self-anaylzing lyrics in How High. It's nice how one song segues into the next- sometimes with a lone drum beat at other times with a well crafted musical blend. For the most part, it's a great CD to listen to. You can tell she had fun making and you'll probably have fun listening to it-- just don't expect anything as original or as daring as Justify My Love or Vogue.
B0006FO8RA|4.0|Okay, so this girl ain't got Mariah Carey's chops but few female artists do these days.  But in her early days she could sing, even if mediocre at that.  Still there is no denying Spears' musical power to persuade regardless if her singing talents may be lacking.  From her very bubblegum beginnings in 1998-1999 (listed here \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Crazy\\") to her latest sophisticated techno-pop (\\"Me Against the Music,\\" \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Outrageous\\"), Britney, in a whirlwind six year span, has become the epitome of the perfectly packaged pop star.  Her stance as the industry's reigning No. 1 female entertainer is only intensified here on her first Greatest Hits album.  Call her a skank, call her a sellout or call her a bad influence; but amazingly Spears has been able to maintain on top through all the accusations and become the fastest selling female performer in history.  On this her Greatest Hits record, the now-24 year-old Britney is out to create even more of a stir since a Greatest Hits is usually after 10 years in the business, and she has only six.  But the important thing to realize (compared to other Greatest compilations like Mandy Moore's, for example) is that Britney Spears is such a cultural phenomenon that only she can put out such a record and keep it at the forefront in sales.  Almost every track on this album has been a sensation on the charts, from her award-winning, Grammy-nominated smash debut \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to 2000's best song (also Grammy-nominated) \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" from mature (also Grammy-nominated) \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" to 2004's best single and Grammy-winning \\"Toxic.\\"  Sure, it has its low moments, like the I-can't-believe-it-was-a-single \\"Boys\\" and the fact that it's missing vocally-decent (in Spears terms, of course) songs like \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know,\\" \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart,\\" but the cover art alone is more than enough of a reason to purchase this CD.  So loveher or hate her, that doesn't matter, folks, because whether you like her or not, Britney Spears is a musical force to be reckoned with.
B00000J7A2|5.0|I bought this on lp. in the cut out bins around 1970, and have loved it since.Zig Zag, Call On Me etc., all cool, unique record (cd)I don't get whenever I read someone review music from the 50's or 60's say it's dated.Well, so is my 1890's home and my friends 1968 Corvette, but they are cool anyway.You want fresh sounds, buy the hip hop or country or the other packaged, phony crap they have been feeding the public for the last couple of decades.Want a good sign a cd might be good? (usually)Make sure it came out in the era of vinyl.Most of that music has staying power.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Well with great anticipation, I bought the DVD. Then I got out my video tape of the Farewell concert of 1969 and compared song for song. I wanted to share my observations. Of course the new concert you hear the drums much better and everything is clearer. <br /> <br />In both concerts they did not move around much, and really just played. The 2005 concern we see Jack sitting at times, however. <br />It was interesting to watch the crowds in both concerts. In the 60's, people moved to the music a lot more. In 2005, people didn't want to make any noise so they can could soak up everything. I had the feeling that wanted to be quiet so they would not miss anything that happened on stage. It was more like going to a jazz concert today.  <br /> <br />1960's Cream <br /> <br />1. Thick guitar tone that was killer. Even when Eric did not play many notes, it just sounded so bloody good. <br />2. Drums were a little busier, with more energy. <br />3. There is more excitment in the playing. <br />4. On White room, Eric used a wa wa pedal which took the sound to a new level. <br />5. Bass guitar had some distortion to it. This helped the music to sound fuller when Eric was doing a solo. Almost like playing Rh guitar with Eric' lead. <br />6. The music flowed more, though they may of lost their place here and there, they were always able to find their way back. <br />7. Jack screamed lyrics more often and with energy. <br />8. Video is poor with the panning in and out while they are playing <br /> <br />2005 Cream <br /> <br />1. Eric Clapton's guitar playing has more deversity with note selections and fills. He has better chops now compared to back then. However since he has more of a modern EC guitar sound, it lacks that magic of the old tone that everyone loved; \\"the woman tone\\". Back then his fills were more limited.  <br />2. Ginger now plays matched grip. A lot of drummers have switched including one of my favorites, Dave Weckel. <br />3. No wa wa pedal on White room, which was disapointing. We can hear him on \\"Just one Night album\\" playing a wa pedal on different songs and it was cool, even with a Strat. Having no wa was little disapointing. <br />4. Ginger's chops are just as good, and more refined than back in the 60's. Love the double kick doing a pattern and his hands doing another, though this appeared to be a lot more limited. <br />5. You can tell they rehearsed a lot for the concert. They were more aware of what each other was doing and was careful to stay together. Not as free flowing as in the old days. <br />6. Jack sang instead of screaming the vocal parts.  <br />7. Bass playing just as good if not better than the old days. <br />8. Clapton's tone is ok, he never got a great sound on the guitar until he did some blues records a couple years ago. (Thats when he used a 335 and Les Paul again.)  <br /> <br />I would of loved to see Eric with a 335 or SG and the Marshal. But I think they all felt, they have to play who they are now, and not try to be the player they were back then. There is some logic to this however to of heard him playing at least one or two songs with the old tone would of been amazing. I still love the John Mayers Blues Breakers tone he got as well.  <br /> <br />Both have their pros and cons, with the old Cream edging out the new with more excitement in their playing and the tone of Eric's guitar. However Ginger's drums sound much better in 2005, and Eric has better leads in the new. <br />
0316172324|5.0|This book is a fast and interesting read, but don't let that mislead you: the information Mr. Gladwell presents is extremely substantive.  What could be more crucial than having our eyes opened to the way we stereotype and misconstrue important information (such as peoples' characters and abilities) in the first few seconds of perception?  Of equal interest is the way that \\"thin slicing\\" of limited initial information can at times yield incredibly accurate results.  This book has helped me, as an artist, understand how art is perceived and perhaps how to better evaluate my own work.  There are times we should trust our gut instincts (our lives may even depend on it), and other times when our judgments could be vastly improved if we were to consciously override our initial impressions or screen out prejudicial information.  While making the distinction between these courses of action can be tricky, training exercises and other techniques are available which would make operations such as law enforcement safer and more effective.  Mr. Gladwell offers a concise and well-researched roadmap through this complex but fascinating terrain.
B00005MNP8|5.0|There are not enough superlatives that I can say about the sheer greatness and magnitude of this classic release by Blondie.<br /><br />This is Blondie at the top of their game and creative powers.  In a lot of respects, this album is similar to The Clash's London Calling in that Blondie was not afraid to touch any musical style, put it through their own unique filter and then unleash the results.<br /><br />Every song is amazing and Debbie Harry's voice was never more luscious or sexy.<br /><br />Not to say they didn't make some incredible music after this release (they did in spades), but this is definitely the definitive Blondie album.
0671799320|5.0|Everyone with a true interest in understanding how oil has become the most important commodity in the world needs to pick up \\"The Prize.\\" Having read it after Mark Kurlansky's \\"Salt\\", I am amazed that more than one material object has had such a profound effect on how the world has been shaped. <br />I have very few criticisms.  I would have liked to see maps of the world when oil was discovered and  post-Desert Storm near the preface to give me a better visual understanding of the changes in boundaries caused by claims of oil. It also would have been nice to have a glossary of important names that when beyond just their current or last title. <br />
B000BC8TBE|5.0|Two bonus songs...fantastic.  The videos...fantastic. <br />The video for \\"O Holy Night\\"...gives me the chills! <br />The picture is so clear and her performance is flawless. <br />Worth every penny to purchase this CD/DVD. <br />Go now...buy it!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I particularly love \\"Speed of Sound.\\" <br /> <br />I've never cared WHAT music critics think - what they like or what they don't like impresses me not a whit.  These are the same geniuses who think that cursing and calling women filthy names over a drum machine is music. <br /> <br /> At 53, I have definite ideas about what I like...and if I like it, that's all that counts. <br /> <br />I don't need some \\"hater\\" to tell me what I should think is good. <br /> <br />Great album.  And I think Chris Martin is adorable. <br /> <br />I highly recommend X&Y.
B000BKDOB6|5.0|Oh, I cannot believe my ears! Wow! I already had the previous remastered version of HORSES but I feel not guilty and I'm totally satisfied of having spent  21,00 for this wonder! The first CD is History with capitol H and, since everything has been said about it in such beautiful and expressive ways I could never reach, I won't tell - except that it is my favourite foreign language album. But the second CD my friends...the second CD, uhhhhh! The entire HORSES album played live in London, last june... I have never had the fortune of seeing Patti and her Group playing live in my country - even though they come here in Italy quite often I always miss them for either the tickets are sold out or I come to know only the day after the concert in newspapers articles! sh..! - so now I finally know what she is about. And I'm beautifully upset. I mean, this Woman is 59 years old and she sings with such a rage, emotion, power, intensity, courage and, finally, love that vivid, sensual vibrations hit you when you listen. It's an incredible experience. \\"Gloria\\" is superb, \\"Birdland\\" (probably my favourite Patti song) nearly makes you forget about the original version and \\"Land\\" with its 17 minutes and an added speech introducing the song just gives you the creeps!  <br />Oh, I'd just like to embrace Patti and hold her tight and just say \\"I salute thee\\", for all she did to me. She changed my way of seeing poetry, music and reality. She makes me dream of hope and beauty and...oh! so many things I would express but I have to go now. <br />So, I strongly recommed you this work of art.
B000B8QF14|1.0|I see an ironic twist here. Green Day gripes and complains and wants their fans to rally against rich politicians. Maybe it's just me, but I find it odd that Green Day, one of the top-paid acts in music today that surely is making a ton of money off this DVD, the \\"American Idiot\\" CD and their anti-George W. Bush rantings, is throwing allegations of abused power and money at others. <br />Get The Killers and Coldplay instead. They're better musicians and writers. Green Day are only popular because of the bandwagon mentality of some people. How come no one ever mentions a specific Green Day song or lyric or guitar part or arrangement as truly great? It's all about empty fashion and hipness, and Green Day are only successful because of flash and being political. These guys are getting to be old men. They're in the mid-30s, yet the kids and Big Media act like Green Day just started this year. These guys disappeared almost in the 1990s and up until about 15 months ago. Now people claim Green Day \\"saved rock.\\" Give me a break. Nuthin' new here that The Clash and The Sex Pistols (and The Who) didn't do first and better. <br />Peace
B000B5IPLK|5.0|Everyone who wrote bad reviews i guess are your opinion, but Alicia Keys is so talented and this Unplugged album is so incredible!! One person mentioned that she was going through an identity crisis, i totally disagree with that, a true musician expresses themselves through there music and is willing to try different things,actually express themselves through different types of sounds.In this case thats what Alicia did. she wasnt afraid to try different music because she was feeling it! And I feel she succeeded.She is all around talented and this album proves it. So if you havent bought it yet, i suggest you get one right away! : )
0312995423|1.0|I am amazed that the same Dan Brown wrote some other pretty good pieces and this one.  <br /> <br />As a computer engineer, I can't help but ask the following questions: <br /> <br />- How come Translator did not have a thermal shutdown mechanism? They haven't ported MBM5 yet? <br />- How come the database server had no backup? <br />- How come all critical information was in one place, the exact opposite of what a robust system needs? <br /> <br />True waste of time.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I love madonna's cd i think she did a great jod on this album all the songs on there are brilliant i hope they play her songs on the raido this is right up there with her old albums think god someone come out with a good cd you get sick of hearing the same old music.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" was originally released 8 months ago. So a reasonable amount of time has elapsed. I consider this to be a true collector's item because Mariah hasn't re-released an album before. In 15 years, this is the first. Certainly she should be entitled to at least one. The 4 new tracks were not available at the time of the original release and neither were the videos. So those suggesting that this is some sort of last minute cash in aren't really being fair or honest. In my opinion, the re-release is better than the already great original.  <br /> <br />I'm really happy to get DON'T FORGET ABOUT US, MAKIN' IT LAST ALL NIGHT, SO LONELY, and the WE BELONG TOGETHER REMIX on CD. How often is Mariah Carey going to go back into the studio and record more songs for an album that's already in the public domain? I would say that this was a rare occasion. And the end product turned out to be exceptional. It really seems like they put a lot of effort into this.  <br /> <br />I'd grab this version because it got the extra special treatment that very few albums do. The quality of the recording is excellent. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is definitely a highlight amongst her many previous recordings. <br /> <br />This would make a great gift for the Mariah fan that you know or for yourself. <br />
B000AP04NI|1.0|The new DVDs from Twentieth Century Fox use a very aggressive copy-protection scheme which grabs command of your player and then wreaks havoc. I had this experience when I inserted the 50th Anniversary Edition of Oklahoma into a Sony DVP-NC80V player. First I was forced to sit through a violent and offensive anti-piracy message and then I discovered that my disc player was completely unresponsive. The remote control would not work and neither would any of the buttons on the player itself. I had to pull the plug in order to turn off the machine.   I recommend that you purchase the London stage revival of Oklahoma and stay away from this release by Fox.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|Johnny Depp gives one of his most subtle performances to date in \\"Finding Neverland,\\" a film about the creative process that has a thing or two to say about the part imagination plays in all our lives.  In this adaptation of the play by Allan Knee, Depp plays J.M. Barrie, the author who, in 1904, introduced the world to Peter Pan.  According to the movie (though not necessarily reality), Barrie gleaned the inspiration for his creation from a beautiful young widow and her four sons whom he met one day in the park and with whom he forged a deep and lasting relationship (there are a few factual errors in that synopsis, but in the interest of keeping your confusion to a minimum, I`ll recount the story as the movie presents it).  In his endeavors to entertain the children, Barrie brought them into his world of magical make believe, eventually weaving the story of Peter Pan out of those experiences.<br /><br />When we first meet Barrie, he is already a well-known and successful playwright in the London theater world - although his latest work has bored his audience and critics so thoroughly in its premiere performance that it is forced to close on opening night.  Suffering from creative stagnation and stuck in a stifling marriage, Barrie eventually finds surcease and an outlet for his creativity with his new-found \\"family\\" from the park.  However, even though the film technically takes place in the Edwardian Era, the iron hand of Victorian Era morality still holds England in its icy grip.  For soon rumors are flying not only about the \\"unseemly\\" relationship between Barrie and Mrs. Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, but even about the questionable and potentially sinister nature of Barrie's relationship with the boys.<br /><br />Written by David Magee and directed by Marc Foster, \\"Finding Neverland\\" offers a touching, fascinating glimpse into the mind of a man in the process of creating one of the most enduring tales of modern literature.  One of the marks of any \\"classic\\" work of inspiration - be it art, music, literature or drama - is that we are never aware of the nuts-and-bolts process that has gone into its creation.  The greater the work, the more we are inclined to believe that it dropped fully formed from heaven, a rare gift from the gods that seems somehow always to have existed somewhere.  That is certainly the case with \\"Peter Pan,\\"  which is why \\"Finding Neverland\\" provides such an invaluable service.  It forces us to acknowledge that even the greatest of creations, which we tend to attribute to that mysterious and intangible entity known as \\"genius,\\" are really the product of one part inspiration to two  parts fortuitous timing and hard work.  \\"Finding Neverland\\" flows effortlessly between the events as they happened in real life and the fantasy scenarios that Barrie eventually wove out of them to create his masterpiece.  As a result, the movie itself has a kind of heightened fairy tale feel to it that works well in the context of the story.  The movie also affords us an entertaining behind-the-scenes view of the creation of the play itself and a breathless recreation of its opening night.<br /><br />In addition to Depp, the film is filled with fine performances by Kate Winslet as Sylvia, Julie Christie as her stern, disapproving mother, Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's sympathetic theater manager, and Radha Mitchell, as Barrie's cold, status-conscious wife.  The four young actors who play the boys are also excellent, with Freddie Highmore, as the precocious and too-cynical-for-his-own-good Peter, a particular standout.<br /><br />Historians may find room to quibble about some of the liberties the film takes with the facts.  Sylvia was not a widow at the time of the story and her husband resented the intrusion of Barrie into their lives.  Even one of the sons has been dropped.  This is acceptable, however, since an over-cluttered plot would likely have robbed the film of the simplicity it needs to sustain its fairy tale ambiance.  Moreover, the movie telescopes a number of key events to enhance their dramatic impact (i.e. his wife's affair with writer Gilbert Cannan, which is shown as being a contemporaneous event, actually occurred a number of years after this part of the story).  But such nitpicking seems fruitless in the overall scheme of the film.<br /><br />Was Peter Llewelyn Davies the real inspiration for Peter Pan or was it J.M. Barrie himself?  The film doesn't answer that question, but it certainly hints at the distinct possibility of the latter.  For Barrie was clearly a man who much preferred the warm fantasies of carefree childhood to the cold cynicism of responsible adulthood.  And that, of course, has always been the heart and soul - as well as the life's blood  - of his own paean to eternal youth, \\"Peter Pan.\\"number of key events to enhance their dramatic impact (i.e. his wife's affair with writer Gilbert Cannan, which is shown as being a contemporaneous event, actually occurred a number of years after this part of the story).

B000B8QEZG|3.0|As the great Madonna obsessed fan that I am, I will be easily tempted to say this is the greatest album of the last 2 years. However, realistically speaking, I must say that this album is more than anything commercial, and personally it feels as if Madonna has taken several steps back and I miss the lyrical depts she had began with Ray of Light, and topped them with American Life (which to me is a great quality album). Any hardcore Madonna fan will tell you this album is the best ever, but if you're new to her music and all you know are her catchy 80's beats, or her mellowness from American Life, then this album is not really for you. Only a very true fan will be able to fully love this album in its whole. Some songs are awesome and potential hits such as 'Hung Up', 'How High', and 'Push', which could be enjoyed by almost everybody. Other good ones such as 'Jump', 'Sorry', and 'Like it Or Not,' and \\"Get Together,\\" might end up as singles but in my opinion, will have a mixed acceptance. Here is my review about each single song. This is only my personal opionion trying my best to not let my obsession from Madonna affect my critique: <br /> <br />1. Hung Up (9/10) - The greatest way to open the album. Its introductory sound of a ticking clock catches you attention right away. This song just flows and is truly a dance hit. <br /> <br />2. Get Together (8/10) - A really smooth song that just makes you feel like dancing sensually in the dance floor. Great song to either relax or dance (very contrasting combination...but this song is very magnetic). <br /> <br />3. Sorry (6/10) - Not my favorite. I probably will not dance it at the club, but I'll have a nice time nodding my head to its beat, (only for a few times though). <br /> <br />4. Future Lovers (2/10) - I dont really like this song. It sounds too superficial and the beat kind of gets to my nerves. This song I truly dont like. I dont like the fact that its beat sounds like something any DJ could make. To me, this isnot a totally Madonna quality song.  <br /> <br />5. New York (5/10) - This song arises mixed opinions in my head. The lyrics can seems a bit stupid at times, as well as repetitive and dumb. However, you will eventually find yourself singing it in your head. Trust me. Its dumb but catchy. <br /> <br />6. Let It Will Be (6/10) - Not bad at all, but not that great either. This to me is just another song in the album. A classic disco beat.  <br /> <br />7. Forbidden Love (6/10) - Same review as above. <br /> <br />8. Jump (8/10) - YES!!! This is where the album gets good to me again. A smooth flowing song with such a sensual dancing beat. The chorus is catchy too. <br /> <br />9. How High (9/10) - Great song. This song truly makes you wanna dance. It has so much attitude in its lyrics and beat. This is just not another dancing song. Listen to the lyrics. The chorus is great, although I suddently realized that 'How High's chorus has almost the same beat as the song the chick from Kill Bill (Elle) whistles when she is gonna attempt to kill Uma Thurman. Listen to it and you'll know what I'm talking about. Im surprised nobody has noticed this!! <br /> <br />10. Isaac (8/10) - The reason why I rated this song high is due to its uniqueness. The whole foreign language this makes it catchy itself. Good dancing beat. I love it when Madonna experiments with something so risky as this. <br /> <br />11. Push (10/10) - This is my favorite of all this album. Not only do I love the lyrics, but I'm also fascinated by the beats this song brings to my ears. So interesting and so danceable. <br /> <br />12. Like it or Not (8/10) - Really good song. Perfect way to close this album with Madonna stating once again that she is the way she is whether you 'Like it or Not.' Not as catchy as \\"Push,\\" but offers a glimpse to see how Madge's personality still remains so unique and has taken her where she is. <br /> <br />*In now way do I think this album is bad quality. However, I must confess I was expecting much more from The Queen of Pop.
B00008PX8P|5.0|All I can say to add to the fact that this is the largest selling music DVD ever,which should say mountains about the fan base, is that the portion from Knebworth is perhaps the very best concert video I have ever seen.  The band was about to partake on a world tour; they all looked good; John Paul Jones and the band had integrated electronics into their sound for their newer music; and they were hot.  This Knebworth set list is absolutely the very best rock video I have seen.  Rush is great, Yes is great, Clapton is great, Eagles are good, Pink Floyd is good, but LZ is on the top of the shelf.  Buy it, and turn it up.
B000002H33|5.0|1986 was a huge year for thrash metal, bands like Slayer and Megadeth recorded some of their best albums and Metallica was no exception. \\"Master of Puppets\\" is some fine work from a band that before this has had 2 metal classics.  <br /> <br />James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett's guitars apart are great but together they make possibly the best sound a person can ever hear. Aside from the guitar Hetfield slurs out every word perfectly. Cliff Burton's driving basslines like in previous Metallica work will not disapoint any listener. What can't you say about Lar Ulrich's quick and merciless drumming he also will never disapoint you.  <br /> <br />If you have heard Metallica before than you know what to expect from this band. \\"Master of Puppets\\" isn't a whole new sound, but an evolution to a better Metallic sound, with good catchy guitar riffs and more amazing than Eddie Van Halen guitar solos. James Hetfield's voice hasn't changed for the most part although it sounds a little different than on the past album. Another thing is the clever lyrics and the structures of the songs.  <br /> <br />Track 1: Battery <br />Begins with an acoustic solo than moves to the thrashy sound we all know and love Metallica for. The song has a good build and a catchy chorus you will hear yourself signing to in no time.  <br /> <br />Track 2: Master of Puppets <br />The albums title track begins with a guitar riff that neraly every Metallica fan knows by heart, along with the lyrics. this in my opinion is the best track on the album. After a while the song begins to slow down and goes into a couple solos, (one of them being done by James Hetfield), then goes back to the basic riff. I really love the verses and how they were put together so intelligently. Also Lar Ulrich doesn't need no drum patterns he does whatever he needs to make a fast beat for this song. also good basswork by Cliff Burton.  <br /> <br />Track 3: The Thing That Should Not Be <br />The song has another intelligent build maybe not as popular as other tracks but it certainly is not a weak one. More signature guitar work and a good solo.   <br /> <br />Track 4: Welcome Home (Sanitarium) <br />Hetfield's haunting vocals gives this song life. The lyrics capture the concept perfectly, it's almost as if it's coming from a person at a mental institution. The slow verse riff and the chorus riff are melding together perfectly. <br /> <br />Track 5: Disposable Heroes <br />Like usual another good build for the song it's not very popular but the concept makes it a good listen. Once again Hetfield's give the song life, \\"BACK TO THE FRONT!!\\" he demands. <br /> <br />Track 6: Leper Messiah <br />The riff is pretty good i enjoy the solo the drumming is awesome as always. This track is weaker than the other ones, i believe it has a lack of creativity but it's still a good song. <br /> <br />Track 7: Orion <br />Very good instrumental this song isn't complete with the double guitar attack, the good bass playing, amazing drumming. among the great solos Hammett and Hetfield produce and near the end Cliff Burton shows off with a Bass Solo. <br /> <br />Track 8: Damage Inc. <br />Another good thrash metal song. (It's the shortest running track on the album at 5:08) The riff is great so is the solo more good energetic drumming from Lars and a thunderous bass playing by Cliff. <br /> <br />This is one of those albums you are required to have before you can call yourself a metalhead. Sadly not to long after this album's release Cliff Burton dead (R.I.P.) He certainly filled up this album with it's pulse. James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett in my opinion are the best metal guitar duo their work is simply unmatched and Lars Ulrich drumming is certainly what keeps the energy alive in the album. James' vocals were simply amazing. <br />   <br />If you are only going to have 1 Metallica album make it this one.
B000B8QF14|5.0|I've read many complaints about the \\"missing six songs.\\" In reality, who cares! BIAB is an attempt, and a damn good one, to capture Green Day's reflections on the AI CD and tour. In other words, it is a documentary. This is a snapshot of the band at this point in time. If you are, as many of you have put it, a \\"Real Green Day Fan,\\" you what take this package for what it is. <br />As far as the CD/DVD, it's pretty damn good. You get Billie Joe's insight on many of AI's most important tracks and you get to see the rest of the band reflecting on recording, touring, familym life, etc. You must remember that when an artist/band release a CD or DVD, in the end, it is what they would like you to see or hear. It is also, in the artists opinion, the most important and entertaining stuff they could find. Many of these complaints sound a great deal like the anti-Dookie rabble that permeated the Bay Area once Green Day hit. <br />BIAB's production and sound quality are awesome. While a concert DVCD cannot reproduce the concert experience, this DVD gives the viewer a great sense of being at a big time rock show. It was nice to see that GD have seem to accept that they are no longer the San Francisco club band that they once were, and take up the mantle of social conscience. While bands like The Clash and U2 have never been shy about the importance of their music, GD have always been reluctant to, in a sense, grow up. Well, the guys have grown up and into on of the great American bands of their time.   <br />So, to those of you who are ready to label Green Day as \\"Sell Outs,\\" remember your history! This has happened once before to this band and they proved all of their detractors wrong. American Idiot is a great accomplishment for GD and for the american music scene. At a time when questioning the powers that be is extremely unpopular, Green Day not only question but criticize the current administration, and in the end they made a great CD. I think one day when all of the 19 & 20year old Green Day fans have hit thirty-something like I have they will l;ook back with fondness on to the fall of 2004 when those guys that made \\"Dookie\\" finally grew up and really had something important to say. While many of us will forget about GWB, we'll probably still be sitting in our cars, driving to work singing \\"Don't wann be an American Idiot!\\" at the top of our lungs. Green Day reminded me that music can still be loud, abrasive and have a point. I saw The Clash on the Combat Rock tour and U2 on Joshua Tree and I am glad to see three punks from San Francisco stand on stage and raise their middle fingers at the small group of billionaires that run this country. I'm not ready to bury Green day just yet.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|This one goes on the shelf never to be heard again....what dance floor are they talking about......pass me the \\"e\\"? Where is the Madonna that brought us Holiday, Like A Prayer, Express Yourself....I know the remixes will be EXCELLENT...until then, wait! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|(from Time Magazine) <br /> <br />The defining moment of the new Madonna album, Confessions on a Dance Floor, arrives during the song I Love New York. Over a pulsing synthesizer, a ticking clock, a rumbling timpani and countless other perfectly calibrated whirs and beeps, Madonna declares, \\"I don't like cities, but I like New York/Other places make me feel like a dork.\\" This is not the most ridiculous lyric ever uttered in a pop song--that remains \\"Yummy yummy yummy/I got love in my tummy.\\" Still, it is awfully silly, and before you press on with the album, you will need to ask yourself, Am I a serious person who listens to music for intellectual enlightenment and makes it a point of pride not to dance under any circumstances? Or am I merely a semi-serious person who makes it a point not to be seen dancing under any circumstances? <br /> <br />If you're the former, Confessions on a Dance Floor is not for you. If you're the latter, close the blinds. Because the words get goofier, and the song gets faster, and pretty soon all you hear are echoes of Madonna's voice behind a glossy thump and a grinding guitar hook. It is possible to remain still while that happens, but only if you are made of wood. <br /> <br />Confessions on a Dance Floor is 56 minutes of energetic moments. It will leave you feeling silly for all the right reasons. <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|4.0|For those of you who've never seen Serenity, you're in for a treat.  By all rights, this film should have done for Joss Whedon what Batman Begins--the best film of 2005--did for Christopher Nolan.  It's got heart, it's got laser battles, a timely message of interstellar poverty...(wait, I'm channeling another Whedon show!)  I'll come right out and admit my bias.  I am a huge Joss Whedon fan.  But there was a time when I would never have been caught dead within ten country miles of him.  \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer?\\" I would scoff.  \\"Please.  I have better taste than to watch THAT.\\"  Then I did.  Then I started watching Angel.  Then I was on board for the launch of Firefly.  And the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br />If you're unfamiliar with Firefly, the TV series off which Serenity is based, here's a mental picture for you.  Imagine a universe much like the ones you've seen on Star Wars and Star Trek.  (Mostly Star Wars.)  Rich, opulent planets flush with technology; a galactic government with an amazing fleet at its disposal; touches of the exotic and elegant abounding.  Now imagine the people who have no money, who live on the edge of that world, scrounging a living off planets not unlike Tatooine.  Laser weaponry is not out there.  They have to make do with old-fashioned revolvers.  And they dress, and speak, as if they were 19th-century American cowboys...the difference being that the rhythm of their speech patterns has a flowery blank-verse deftness to it, much like something a rustic Shakespeare might have written.  Then stretch a story across nine characters from all different backgrounds and walks of life, throw in more backstory than the Hundred Years' War, and drop it all on an outdated but sturdy spaceship.  Now you've got a conception of about 1/10 of Firefly. <br /> <br />Serenity, sadly, has to jettison many of the Western elements in favor of a more traditional action-movie setup.  But as an action movie, it's quite brilliant.  As a comedy, it's sharp and playful.  As a drama, it's touching and occasionally rises to the level of real tragedy.  As science-fiction, both the concepts and the CGI can be a little shaky (Reavers ahoy), but then again, very few Hollywood films rise to the level of real sci-fi.  This film, while asking for far more of a suspension of disbelief than most of its genre brethren, makes up for it by providing a rollercoaster ride of an experience, thrusting you into its backstory and then its main story so quickly that you barely have time to breathe.  People not disposed to wait for the payoff will quickly grow bored, but for the patient viewer, this film eventually pays back ten times what it asks from you. <br /> <br />So why only a four-star rating?  Let's be honest.  The film is good, with great moments.  It has, however, the unenviable task of wrapping up as many Firefly plotlines as possible while still standing on its own as a film.  That it manages to do this, even to a partial extent, is frankly amazing.  Still, some characters that were major players in the series are little more than glorified window dressing here...the same problem that plagued the Star Trek: TNG movies.  There are also some moments in the film which jarred me so much as a fan that I was unable to fully enjoy the theatrical experience.  (Without getting into spoilers, let's just say that for a film involving, however peripherally, the demise of millions of people, Whedon could have greatly improved my viewing experience with just a couple fewer deaths.) <br /> <br />Still and all, these are small complaints.  Though Batman Begins is a superior film, Christopher Nolan had many luxuries Joss Whedon did not...a far superior budget; the weighty resumes of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson; and years of stories to sift through to get everything right.  Whedon, however, in inventing this universe from scratch, has the advantage of malleable material to shape into his stories.  He stretches his budget to the limit to turn in a beautiful, if rough, film.  And he takes advantage of top-notch performers like Nathan Fillion and Chiwetel Ejiofor who aren't household names...but soon will be. <br /> <br />If you can only find room in your budget for one genre DVD purchase, and you don't think this is it, then stretch your budget.  This film is a must-own.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I recently watched this classic again for the first time in years, having previously viewed it about a half dozen times.  It was great to see one of my all-time faves brought to DVD.  The Pythons epitomize the greatest imaginations and creativity in British humor, and this movie is, in my humble opinion, the hands-down best work of the Python troop.<br /><br />There are probably precious few souls who haven't seen this at least once, so there's little I can add about the movie itself that hasn't already been praised in earlier reviews.  I was especially pleased with some of the special features on this DVD, including the \\"tutorial\\" on how to maximize the use of coconuts for a full equine \\"riding\\" experience.  Needless to say this was done in the classic Python style by Mr. Palin himself.  Also great was the \\"Camelot\\" song-and-dance routine done with Lego figures -- brilliant!<br /><br />What can I say?  You need to see this for yourself, so rush right out and get it.  Might as well pick up a coconut while you're at it -- you'll need that too.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Superb CD!! I will go as far to say this is her best work.  It has the passion and energy of her other albums like \\"Ray of Light\\", but it exceeds them in almost every way.<br /><br />From the moment I first heard the single \\"Hung Up\\", I was expecting something good here.  Thank you Madonna for not letting us down!!.  This is great CD throughout all tracks.  From the sensational, moving \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Jump\\" to a slower \\"Forbidden Love\\" or \\"Like It or Not\\", the CD is packed with fantastic energy, composure, passion and fun.  One can hardly keep from dancing!!  She does some strong lyrics throughout and is able to make the words just flow with the music.<br /><br />It is well mixed and recorded.  We will surely see many renditions of these tracks.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I absolutely love this movie. As I'm a female, many would jump to the conclusion that Brad Pitt is the reason. Wrong. Don't get me wrong, he's very easy on the eyes, and lord, he convinced me he was THE Achilles, the greatest warrior who ever lived. (Up to that point anyway.) But there was so much more to it. The story was compelling, MOST of the actors did a fantastic job, (Peter O'Toole is still one the most amazing actors out there, and he had me in tears during a certain scene where he ask Achilles for a small mercy) and the location was as beautiful as the leads. No, the movie didn't change my life...but what ever happened to just enjoying the ride and being entertained? Have critics forgotten that or something?    One of the few weak spots had the name of Diane Kruger. She was lovely enough to maybe launch a hundred ships...but a thousand? Setting that aside, the girl added no charm, no sensuality that would have made it believable. Her performance as Helen could only be described as bland.     Seeing as that's the only weak link, go out and rent this movie. Maybe you won't want to buy it, but trust me, you need to see this at least once.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I think the post by Tensor was a little premature.  He is accusing so many people of writing reviews before, according to him, \\"anyone has seen it.\\"  I saw this movie in theaters and was immediately hooked.  I then watched the series on DVD and it is probably one of the most fantastic scifi shows/movie I have ever seen.
6305095442|4.0|this is just as good as the 1st but this one has alot of dark comedy which works very well with this film. they even tried to change the color of the blood too try and escape an NC-17 rating<br /><br />very funny and very dark
B0002EXH4A|3.0|I am reviewing this cd, as a somewhat new fan, not because im just hearing Megadeth for the first time, but in the fact that I have heard very few of the original recordings because they do not sell them in stores anymore. I know you can buy them on the internet but i really dont have the kind of patience it takes to wait for the cd to get to your house. This is my least favorite of all the Megadeth albums I have purchased so far, but I am not saying it is bad. The first two songs are especially good, as is In My Darkest Hour, the best on the cd. I also enjoy Liar and Mary jane. 502 gets credit for good lyrics but it isn't truly a song. There's a lot of added stuff in it. Anarchy in the U.K. is definnitely the low point (who wants to hear Megadeth performing a Sex Pistols cover?). Just like on Peace Sells... the four bonus tracks are hardly worth listening to because they are just repeats of other songs on the cd. The bonus ones sound mostly the same but just arent as good. As I said earlier, this is my least favorite Megadeth album, but it is still worth buying if you are a fan.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|I must admit I've mostly just listened to this CD while in the car and haven't analyzed the lyrics.  The overall impression is of mellow, relaxing music with Neil's pleasant-sounding voice--that is, he's not sounding raunchy, nor screaming, etc., on this CD.  Read other reviews for analysis of the lyrics, but if you want a good CD to mellow out with, this is a good pick.
