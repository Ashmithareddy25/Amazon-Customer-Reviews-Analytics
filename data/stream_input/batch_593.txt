B0007P0LO8|4.0|I can't understand all this carping about how rotten Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's film is. Okay, this isn't Orson Welles. The film is certainly flawed, with a few cheesy moments, most of which have been mentioned in other reviews(the opening, with Domingo in a T-shirt comically running through a paper wall, the bizarre dream sequence, Goro as a bucktoothed stereotype). These flaws are what prevent me from giving the film a five star rating. But there are also some very beautiful moments, and besides, from an aural standpoint, you aren't going to find a better performance of Madama Butterfly ANYWHERE. Get a grip, folks. To hear Freni and Domingo at their prime singing what is arguably Puccini's greatest score(it is certainly his most beautiful) conducted by Herbert von Karajan, and for under twenty dollars, I would be willing to put up with the singers running around in clown makeup for two-and-a-half hours. The music making on this disc is simply too good not to be recommended just because the filmmaker's ambitions occasionally tax his reach.    For me, a good opera film captures the mood of the music. Butterfly is probably Puccini's most atmospheric, lush, and dreamy score(although La Fanciulla del West is stiff competition), and Ponnelle's film is appropriately dreamlike. Let's use the marvelous love duet that ends the first act as an example. For me, this duet, along with Liu's death scene from Turandot, represents Puccini at the very height of his musical-dramatic brilliance. The music is rapturous and erotic, delaying the crescendo until the moment becomes almost unbearable. Ponnelle paints this music in dreamlike images of ever-increasing passion. Granted, this film was made in 1974, so some of the more trippy moments might seem a little dated, but if you take that into account, the moment is beautifully filmed, haunting and evocative, just like the score. The image perfectly matches the music...isn't that what opera on film is all about? If this were the only example of this perfect union of sound and vision, then I would be less enthusiastic about the film as a whole, but throughout most of Madama Butterfly, Ponnelle manages that lush, languorous tide of images that matches Puccini's flowing music.    Regarding the sound portion, as I said before, you won't hear Butterfly performed better, that is a guarantee. Mirella Freni IS Cio-Cio-San, the innocence, the passion, the self-delusion, the heartbreak. Oh, and she sings the role to perfection, capturing the character's timidity and strength. Butterfly's entrance is probably my favorite musical entrance in all opera, and hearing Freni's singing, quiet at first and from a distance, gradually building as she and her bridal party make their arrival, is a breathtaking moment, outclassing any staged production I have ever seen. A very young Placido Domingo is in prime voice, and is ideally cast as the rake B.F. Pinkerton, initially  cavalier to the point of being cruel, later violently regretful(too little, too late). He does look somewhat risible running in slow motion with his arms flailing about in his handlebar mustache, but overall he is a fine romantic lead. Robert Kerns has a strong and compassionate baritone voice, which matches his character's best qualities, the voice of reason, Pinkerton's disregarded conscience. Having Christa Ludwig in the role of Suzuki might be considered luxury casting, since her character is less prominent, but she makes the most of her time onstage as the matronly confidante to Butterfly, she is definitely at her prime vocally at this point in her career. Von Karajan's conducting is also in its prime, not as slow as it sometimes is, or else I didn't notice it because the slowness matches the languid tempo of much of the music. The sound quality is clear and full-bodied enough that hardly any of the notes are obscured.    Forget the negative reviews. If you love Butterfly, give this a chance. There are flaws, but considering the strengths of the performances and of much of the film, those flaws are easily overlooked.

I just hate when I see somebody come on here calling the man whack when he isn't. Eminem changed rap in his own way rather you like it or mutha f****** not. Peace <br />
0385513755|4.0|When I started reading this book, it was a little confusing, but I guess it's one of those books where you have to read more to find out, because at the end it all fit and it was great!<br /><br />Anyway, to whoever asked, the pictures and illustrations add so much to the story! I don't know if I ever could have figured it out without them. It's also very interesting how Dan Brown fit all the real facts together to create a fiction story!<br /><br />Wow. A great story. I really recommend it!
B000AU9UYM|4.0|This one gets batman back to his roots, the movie is about Batman and not some super fancy ironic bad guy. <br /> <br />More human all round, nicely stylish and a DVD packed full of extras, what more do you want -- this is very nice! <br /> <br />receommended!
B000F6IOC0|1.0|Loved the first one, And like this squeal too ...Great action pack vampire movie. Is kind of like \\"blade\\" but whole lot better action with great sense.

B0009A40ES|5.0|American Psycho is an amazing film that is based on Bret Easton Ellis' book. It has amazing acting, great direction, a brilliant script, and great visual imagery. <br /> <br />Often catagorized as horror, this is nothing of the sort. It's neither comedy or horror, but a brilliant satire of the yuppies in the 80's. It's funny, horrific, and disturbing. That's an accomplishment on its own. <br /> <br />Bale(Bateman) has an amazing performance in his role. His acting adds to every scene in the film that he's in. The supporting cast is also very good. There's not one person in the entire film that had a bad scene. <br /> <br />Don't go in expecting a Halloween type movie. Expect a hilarious, disturbing piece of cinema. It will truly amaze you.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|Since other reviewers have gone into great detail about plot and characters, I won't go there.  However, I will say this is an excellent movie for everyone.  Emma Thompson is a complete delight, as are all of the characters.  I love seeing that Angela Lansbury is still appearing in movies.  She's a sparkling gem and has been since the Golden Age of Hollywood.  This movie made me laugh, cry, and think.  What more could I have asked for? The ending is a little predictable, but it didn't ruin the movie for me in any way.  I was very surprised to see one reviewer say the atmosphere of the movie was too dark. That really left me scratching my head trying to understand that.
B00005JOVH|2.0|I am not rating this sequel as \\"horrible\\", but compared to the two prequels...this story line falls FAR short.  The movie itself, on it's own, I would rate 3 out of 5 stars...it has a lot of good action sequences.  Otherwise, without spoiling it for you...if you do go to see it, stay until the credits are done rolling...there is one final scene.
0440180295|5.0|I had to read this book when I was a senior in high school, in Mr. Marcinec's AP English class in Johnstown High School, New York, geographically in the area where the book was written and situated. At the time I was trying to choose between going to West Point and the Air Force Academy, and reading Mr. Vonnegut changed my plans and my life. If it weren't for this book, I might well be directing operations against Iraqi civilians right now. Thank you, Kurt Vonnegut, thank you, thank you from here to Tralfamadore. <br /> <br />Subsequently I learned that wrapped up in science fiction's basic impulse was a response to the kind of atrocious killing first experienced during military conflicts of the twentieth century. The technologically dominated nature of those conflicts was very different, and what its victims experienced could not be accurately described by reaching back onto any touchstones of history because new realities had leapfrogged old language. Thus their horror could only be communicated at removes through epic myth, satire, or even by moving as Vonnegut did entirely outside the box of molecular matter itself. War veterans like Tolkien, Heller, and Vonnegut were pioneers in a new literary device, one which came to overshadow traditional literature by the latter half of the twentieth century in both cultural impact and book sales. <br /> <br />Vonnegut projects himself into the device and character of Billy Pilgrim, who serves as a gawkish hapless soldier and simultaneously lives a blessedly bourgeoius post-war existence in upstate New York; he writes outside time in order to make sense of the impersonal, mechanized brutality he experienced as a prisoner of war while digging thousands of dead, rotting civilians out of basements in Dresden, Germany for weeks after its fire-bombing.  <br /> <br />In performing such grisly work, unendurable for any of us on a personal level, I believe Mr. Vonnegut had to leave his mind and senses in order to function, and thatthe protective mental refuge he went to formed the kernel of this indispensable book. While digging and removing himself from the present, he must have determined to write an anti-war story unlike any other to stand the tests of all time. Kurt Vonnegut succeeded, and 2,000 years from now when people study war (assuming we make it so long), Slaughterhouse Five will remain. It is the post-modern equivalent of the phrase, \\"Go tell the Spartans.\\"

What a nonsense !  <br />No,please,that's really too much.  <br />Not inspired at all.I do NOT feel it.There are no feelings,emotions in it.This is just another sly cash-in-project with the clever supervision of the money-maker-producer Clive Davis...  <br />And Amazon calls that type of junk albums.....ESSENTIAL RECORDINGS ?!?! What a nonsense !  <br />The WORST albums (which just make a lot of money at the expenses of innocent,music-uncoscious,radio-bombarded house-wives and farmers... with ONE eye surprisingly at the best-sellers charts...) are \\"essential.... recordings\\"....( e.g. check out the latest CDs by Celine-Selline Dion, Mariah Carey, Bette Midler ,Barry Manilow ,Carly Simon ,Kenny G..They all are just in the same,same category!).

B00003CWL6|5.0|as a 15 your old girl i didnt have much expectations for this movie.  it sucks you right in to the minds of the Burnhams and shows you what really happens behind the white picket fence.  at the end of this movie i was breathless and even watched it again the next day.  after everytime your done watching it you walk away with a new insight on life.  this movie makes you think and really gives you a new outlook on lifel.  i would recommend this movie to everyone, its funny, serious and everything else a movie should be
B000000WA4|5.0|Thinking about it, going back to October 1995, at its release, I remember watching the music video of \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings.\\"  Went out and bought the double album, was Completely. Blown. Away. I never expected to like an album from the Smashing Pumpkins more than I liked Siamese Dream.  The lyrics are amazing and set perfectly to their musical backdrop of spine tingling chords and huuuge symphonic orchestrations.  Just wow.  Very impressive and novel.  The lyrics were so gut-wretching painfully true and just stuck with me over a decade later.
B000002ADT|5.0|Okay, what I want to know is, does it get any better than this?<br /><br />This is one of those \\"jaw droppers\\" where it just leaves you wondering how in the world did they come up with this? And the answer is, I feel, that they were \\"not of this world\\" when they did it...they couldn't have been! The music is too divinely inspired, too ethereal to just have been made by mere flesh and blood.<br /><br />Miles Davis doesn't just got soul, Soul's got Miles Davis. There are mournful lows, elated highs, tears of sorrow, tears of joy. This baby has it all!<br /><br />This recording will never die.<br /><br />As long as the earth keeps spinning in its orbit, this classic will be around long after we are all gone.<br /><br />If you aren't totally enchanted by this CD, you might want to go to a doctor and have him take your pulse. You could, just quite possibly be dead.<br /><br />Spend the money. It'll give you way more than what you spent.<br /><br />P.S. Happy 80th birthday, Miles!
B000BW7QWW|3.0|Not bad, not fantastic. Flaws: the plot hook on which the entire story ultimately depends, is a clumsy, entirely unbelievable macguffin (which I won't explain, as it's a spoiler. Hint: that's not how experimental research is ever done, in anyone's universe.) The scripting and camera work is occasionally over the top - I'm sorry, you can't make something dramatic by focusing in on bare feet, walking on a floor. But the acting was ok and if you ignore the over the top premise, the movie moves along well. It looked to me like the central actress did her own fight scenes and pulled them off pretty well, and she did a decently disturbing psycho.     I never saw Firefly, so I probably missed some of the emotional impact. There were some very funny lines. Decent late night popcorn-muncher.    Addendum: Having now seen all of Firefly (GREAT series!), this movie looks better than it did. It was clearly an attempt to finish telling the story the Firefly series was setting up to tell, and it does it nicely. An absolute must-have for the Firefly fans.
B000002KHY|5.0|As I grow older I find myself looking more and more for those CDs that relax me, mellow me, and soothe me. This is one of my favorite CDs for doing just that. I mean, I liked JT even in my 20s, but now that I'm in my 40s, I really appreciate the guy.<br /><br />If you've never seen him in concert, go! If for some reason you can't, buy this CD. It won't be the same as hearing him live, but then again you won't have to fight crowds and having someone passing you a funny little cigarette, either...mellow is good...but comatose is another story.<br /><br />(Hey, we've all been there...)<br /><br />It's funny how I don't seem to \\"time stamp\\" JT's music on anything. Sometimes I hear a piece of music and I'll think of something in my past, but with JT I'm always in the moment and that's a good thing, it means his music is timeless and transcends borders or labels. Yeah, you could say that he's from Planet 70s, but to me, he fits right in with the times we are going through now.<br /><br />I'm through with being in a hurry. I go the speed limit. I'm in bed by 11PM most nights, I don't eat too much fast food, and I let the funny little cigarettes be passed to the younger kids. You may say I'm being boring, but maybe I'm tired of running through life and now I want to breathe it all in and this recording helps me do just that.<br /><br />Buy it...you'll like it.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|I went into this movie wanting to like it, I really did.  But I just didn't and here's why: <br /> <br /> For one, Heath Ledger is almost impossible to understand.  He mumbles throughout the whole movie!   <br /> <br />I also never really bought that they were in love, they just like having sex with each other.  If Jack really loved Ennis, why did he cheat on him?   <br /> <br />The movie wants you to feel bad for Jack and Ennis, but I felt sorry for their wives who they lied to and cheated on.  <br /> <br />The editing was bad, it was difficult to tell how much time had passed.  The actors did not age well.  It just didn't look believable at all.  Putting a mustache on Jake Gyllenhal doesn't make him look 20 years older.  It makes him look like a kid playing dress up. <br /> <br />The part where one of them says \\"Why can't I quit you\\" is laughable in its cheesiness. <br /> <br />The one good thing about this movie was the beautiful scenery and cinematography. <br />
B00004VVNB|4.0|Logan's Run belongs to a class of old school science fiction films which were popular in the early and mid-1970's, prior to the beginning of the Star Wars franchise. These films did not rely on non-stop action or dazzling special effects, but rather on thoughtful, intelligent stories, intriguing \\"What if?\\" scenarios, and astute social commentary. They included Sci Fi classics such as Soylent Green, The Omega Man, The Andromeda Strain, Westworld, and others. While the shopping mall setting and some of the special effects of Logan's Run are pretty cheesy, it is still an interesting film and its themes may be even more relevant in today's botox era than they were in the 70's. I have heard they are doing a remake and would like to think it will improve on the original. Unfortunately, given the recent history of Hollywood, it is more likely that they will drain every last bit of intelligence out of the story, and replace it with more explosions, and perhaps Will Smith.
B0000DZ3EN|2.0|Honestly I can see why this movie bombed back in the eighties when it was released! I really don't know what planet some of these reviewers are living on , it is boring, cheesey effects and the claymation is second rate! Disney could have and should have done a lot better with this release, and I am sure they know it!  I had a good laugh after watching this movie thinking back how some people said in their reviews \\"not for children\\" Come on!!!! Geez, I thought the old version of Wizard of Oz  had some scenes in it that were waaayyy creepier than any of this movie! Do not be deceived by these ridiculous four and five star ratings, it rates two stars at best!!!
B000EGCIU0|5.0|I didn't think I could love a P!nk album as much as I did \\"M!ssundaztood\\" but I have to say that \\"I'm Not Dead\\" is an amazing album and that I may like it even better that \\"M!ssundaztood\\". P!nk is in a whole different league with this album. \\"I'm Not Dead\\" is one of the must-own albums of 2006 in my opinion.  Buy it!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I rented this movie, not knowing what to expect. But this movie got to be good, I thought, since everyone loves it. <br /> <br />What I can tell you is that good doesn't quite cover the level this film is on. This movie demonstrate true power! You will be deeply moved, emotionally, to the messages this movie conveys, and become magnetized to live out a better existence.
0385336691|4.0|Jack Reacher always leaves me breathless.  Lee Child writes one heck of a thriller; this was more like a procedural, but that's OK too.  It was catchy to use The Dakota as a base and revolve around that memorial to John Lennon. Kept interest.    The baddies were the baddest and Jack Reacher was just great altho this time he was not as infallible in the beginning chapters. He is alway in the wrong place at the wrong time and Lee Child writes a whole adventure around that premise.    But as usual, the final chapters are exciting, nail biting and you cannot put the book down.  The author leaves you wanting more by making Jack Reacher disappear as if he were a storm cloud moving on.      Waiting for the next, Mr. Child.  I am a fan.   P.S. I like the UK cover better!
B00005U122|5.0|This is really just an unbelievable DVD that needs to be viewed by all people, regardless of their feelings for classic rock or Pink Floyd. Snowy White, a British blues guitarist, and Doyle Bramhall II, a Texan with an SRV style to his playing, take over for Mr. Gilmour and do it justice. Doyle Bramhall... his attire takes some getting used to. Hes easy to dislike. I rolled my eyes and sneered upon the sight of what looked to me like a high-class gigolo from the 80's.... but this kid ROCKS. In fact: As I'm writing this he is on tour with Eric Clapton, along with Derek Trucks from the Allman Bros. Believe me: Bramhall II, is a legend in the making (and I think hes toned down his attire lately... which is good). Kudos to Roger for grabbing this talent. <br />Jon Carin, who amazingly enough is now touring with David Gilmour... is obvously a very talented and likable fellow. What he and the band do with Dogs is beyond words. Carin's strumming and excellent voice along with Bramhall's ferocious guitar chops... you just got to see/hear it to believe. <br />The backing singers are very soulful. Well two of them are... the skinnier girl on the right (from your/audience's perspective) does close to nothing as far as I can tell and screws up her only solo (on the Bravery of Being Out of Range), but the other girls belt out some spine-chilling solos. The way the one lady sings Mother... and the way the other girl sings Perfect Sense... you couldn't ask for more soulful, well-honed voices with those two around. <br />Roger, as another reviewer said, is very at ease and constantly expresses his enjoyment... for better or worse. I guess the thing of it is, and my only real gripe, is that this concert shows that Roger Water's Live doesn't really need Roger Waters. Half the time his hands aren't on the instrument!!! but he is instead interacting with the crowd. Cool, but uh... you get the feeling that he may as well put down the bass and just do his singing/talking. Fairweather-Lowis usually playing the bass lines that you hear. <br />I won't go track by track (C. Numb rocks!), but will just sum up by saying that I love all Floyd, and do consider Mr. Gilmour's unique, expressive guitar to be perhaps the most quintessential piece to what is really Pink... but if you just take this concert for what it is... it is a true masterpiece.
B0006399FS|1.0|After holding out on this album for the past couple of years, I finally decided to give the terminally dull and boring corporate pop band and aging male fashion models known as U2 another chance, so I gave it a listen. Just what I expected: more overproduced, derivative(I do give em credit for somehow being able to constantly rip-off newer, more innovative bands and have rock critics STILL hail them as innovators. Neat trick, that), paint by numbers adult contemporary twaddle masquerading as rock n' roll, with plenty of Bono's half-asleep sounding crooning and pompous, pretentious drivel masquerading as lyrical genius and more sophomoric, unoriginal, effects-dependent \\"guitar playing\\" from the man with the stupidest stage name in the history of humanity, the Edge, the man who might as well be replaced by a computer for all the soul and humanity his \\"playing\\" displays. As for Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton, the less said about the most lifeless and laughable rhythm section in the world, the better. The fact that this carefully planned, soulless, lifeless corporation has found itself in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame is further proof that the HOF cares not for energy, innovation, and most importantly, ROCK N' ROLL, but rather whoever sold the most albums.This [...] is for bleached blonde suburban soccer moms to have something other than Celine Dion and Michael Bolton to listen to while driving their Ford Expeditions to get their nails done. I remember reading an interview with Bono where he said that he wanted his band to make the same kind of records Gene Vincent made. Gene was rolling in his grave at that one, I'm sure. They've never even come REMOTELY close to making anything as exciting and vital as Gene and the Blue Caps.  In short, this album, like all of U2's work, is dull, uninspired corporate drivel that is the antithesis of rock n' roll.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Unlike your editorial review, my kids (20 & 14) share the same views as I do regarding this movie.  ITS A CLASSIC!!!!  Its funny...its fabulous!!!!  Its still in the top five favorites of comedies to date along with Ghostbusters and Arthur.  Thanks for the re-release...(~_~)
6305278016|4.0|Imagine Blade Runner in present times without the sci-fi element.  That's this movie.  This movie is well filmed and directed by Ridley Scott with great performances by Michael Douglass, Andy Garcia, and Ken Takakura.  The believable feel of the movie and the dark mood contribute to the atmosphere, which pulls the viewer in.  The story is very well constructed and it really got me frustrated and anxious at times.  I was definately participating mentally with the events of the movie.  Ridley Scott deserves much more recognition for this film, and a Special Edition DVD.  I say, forget Hannibal, and give this movie some more attention.  Recommended to any moviegoer and Ridley Scott fan.
B000BRBA8S|3.0|Mr. Chow is a man lost adrift the memories of past relationships that had once held meaning for him, but are now long gone. He is a writer who had an affair with a woman in the hotel room number 2046 long ago and has never been able to let go. Some time later he arrives at the Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and asks the owner to let him live in room 2046, but the owner will not allow him to until it is ready. In the meantime, he moves into room 2047 next door and begins writing an erotic science-fiction story called \\"2046,\\" and in it he transposes characters from his real life into characters in his story. Soon Mr. Chow finds himself entangled in various affairs and emotions of love that ultimately fail because memories from the past have not released their hold on him. <br /> <br />The cinematography was stunningly gorgeous. The colors and the artistry of each shot blended together to paint a picture of the vivid pain and heartfelt love experienced by Mr. Chow as they spanned nearly a century into a sad and lonely future. Every moment lingers; every note of music resonantes with sorrow and profoundess as each woman drifts in an out of Chow's life like specters of long lost memories. <br /> <br />It was a gorgeous film, but those who have little patience will probably not be able to maintain interest in the slow, deliberate pace of the film. <br /> <br />
0887307280|3.0|After reading many books in my life, I have noticed several things. <br /> <br />Most books are about 200 pages long. <br />and all books split into 1 of these 2 categories: <br />1. Books that are 200 pages and contain 200 pages of content. <br />2. Books that are 200 pages and contain 10 or 20 pages of content, (the rest is inflated, 180 or 190 pages of bubble gum that is being chewed and chewed, so the writer can say \\"I have a 200 pages book, pay me a full price\\"). <br /> <br />This is the feeling I have from this book. <br /> <br />The 20 pages of content are good, <br />the rest is horrible and irrelevant, and it wastes my time. <br />I would prefer to pay a full price of a book and get some small thin notebook of 10 pages, and read it straight, rather than having my time disrespected and wasted.
0312321376|5.0|In \\"Life Before Life,\\" Dr. Jim Tucker, successor to Dr. Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia Division of Personality Studies, presents their work in a way that is rigorous enough for the scientific community, and yet readable by the lay audience. Dr. Tucker's approach is disarmingly straightforward, as he rationally examines all sides of the issue. In a non-threatening manner, he presents evidence which, if taken seriously, is inherently radical. Where I would characterize the stance of mainstream science with red flags like \\"in denial,\\" Dr. Tucker calmly acknowledges that mainstream science is by nature conservative; where I would say something like \\"reincarnation has been proven, already, let's get on the stick,\\" Dr. Tucker carefully explains what the alternative interpretations are, the extent to which they are plausible, and the extent to which they probably are not. <br /> <br />If it were possible to convince mainstream science with a calm, rational, non-threatening explanation, this book would do it. To borrow from something philosophy professor Dr. Robert Almeder told me when I interviewed him for \\"In Another Life,\\" if it were possible to calmly and rationally explain to a man that his brother is a murderer, without his going into denial and ridiculing you, then Dr. Tucker is the man who could do it. <br /> <br />In short, the information is here. The work has been done, and the results are in. To use one of Dr. Stevenson's own analogies, the tennis player has hit the winning shot, and it was in-bounds. Now it is up to the scientific community, and the society at large, to come to grips with it. In order to do that, they will have to admit that much of our currently-accepted philosophy is wrong, psychology is wrong, genetics is wrong, and much more. It's like the 75-cent accounting error that leads to the international hackers--if the materialistic view of the world is correct, this research simply shouldn't be there. But it is, and Dr. Tucker is justsitting down with you on a fine Sunday afternoon with a glass of tea, and telling you. (If you don't cup your hands over your ears and say \\"yah, yah, yah,\\" though, you may spill your tea.) <br /> <br />One of the subtle points that Dr. Tucker makes several times in this book, addresses the various objections to the work that have been put forth by skeptics. He points out that these alternative explanations, what he terms the \\"normal\\" explanations, may (if stretching) fit the facts of a particular class of cases, but not all. Another such explanation may fit another class of cases, but again, not all. If the cases are taken as a whole, however, then these explanations aren't adequate. In other words, one has to isolate out a group of cases while deliberately ignoring others, in order to infer that these explanations are reasonable, because the cases one is ignoring would invalidate the explanation. Similarly, Dr. Tucker points out that if there exists an adequate number of extremely strong cases, then by inference, most likely the cases that couldn't be proven so conclusively still have similar characteristics. As an example, if we have quite a few cases in which notes were taken of the child's statements about his past life, showing conclusively that it was not a matter of the two families mis-remembering or exaggerating what the child had remembered; then by inference, the other cases, in which we don't have that conclusive evidence, probably were also not a result of the two families mis-remembering or exaggerating. If your grandfather mysteriously goes outside twice a day, and on three occasions you have hidden behind a bush and have seen him smoking a cigar when he's gone outside, the most logical explanation is that twice a day he sneaks out to smoke a cigar. Dr. Stevenson and colleagues have \\"caught grandpa\\" outside smoking the cigar on several occasions, as it were, by obtaining notes taken of the child's statements before the two families had the chance toshare information. Therefore the most likely interpretation is that this kind of sharing is not behind most of the reports, even when notes had not been taken beforehand. What the skeptics are doing, is to deliberately set aside the incidents where Grandpa was observed smoking, and then state that the rest is mere speculation. Well, the rest may be speculation to one degree or another--but it most definitely is not mere speculation. And therein lies the logical flaw. <br /> <br />This book contains the gist of over 40 years of work by Dr. Stevenson and colleagues, which is ongoing. They have 2,500 cases, and this book presents some of their strongest, as well as drawing briefly on statistics from large numbers of cases which can be grouped into various categories. It is not a substitute for reading Dr. Stevenson's reports directly, but it is an excellent introduction and a must-read for anyone interested in the field of reincarnation studies, afterlife studies, the mind-body relationship or any aspect of the Dualism vs. Materialism controversy. <br /> <br />
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Many of the people that have reviewed this DVD seem to miss a Big point. It is NOT a movie. It is a TV series. Four one hour episodes, and it should be enjoyed as such. It was not written to give a you a good feeling inside, it tells it as it was, and life back then was cold, brutal and harsh. That love could emerge through it all, is the bonus.
B00004RCKX|5.0|I guess the point of a dramatic move with a message is to make you think and reflect when it's over. Well, this hits it dead on the screws. This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen. It moves along seamlessly with the black and white flashbacks accompanied by a beautiful score. Norton, Furlong, D'angelo, Brooks, Suplee, Gould and Balk give great performances and Tony Kaye does a marvelous job of directing. The road to the racist mindset is slightly shallow, but it is implied enough to make the leap of faith to buy into the premise of the storyline. I give this movie a 5* rating and recommend it highly. I think everyone should see it once.
B0000021RB|5.0|Want to hear something different and ground breaking? Well this album delivers both in spades !! As a mere 16y old in the late 1960's I was used to the very special music that was being made both in England and the US. However I was not prepared for this. This wasn't \\"progressive rock\\", \\"jazz\\" \\"pop\\" or \\"blues\\". In fact it couldn't be categorised and that's where the beauty of this music lays. Right from the outset your ears will wonder where the tunes will take you next. How can for instance \\"free form guitar\\" and \\"does anybody know what time it is ?\\" be on the same album. Would this be the case today ? I won't say anything further...just to invite you to listen to probably the most inventive a technically brilliant piece of music you might ever come across. And I mean cw Pet Sounds or any of the Beatles output !!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I noticed there are some pretty negative comments here.  Remember any piece of art like an album features the hearts and work of more than one person.  Obviously there are in addition to Avril, great producers, musicians and engineers involved in this work.    I love Avril's music and I'm sure like most of us,  she has beautiful aspirations to give her love and good feelings to others. Yes and we all often get lost on the way, then everyone judges us on our mis-steps.    The overall feeling I get is theres a great deal of real true feelings here. Not posing!    There are some incredible musical gems here, well worth your support.    So Love to Avril, her team and the fans of something beautiful in this world.    Critics should do something beautiful themselves before judgeing others.
0066620996|4.0|I loved the hedgehog concept and for that this book receives 4 stars. Simply put: the hedgehog concept is an understanding of what people can be the best at. While the fox knows a lot of things, the hedgehog knows one BIG thing - and therefore the hedgehog always wins!<br /><br />In addition, the concept of the bus is a nice idea: first who then what, place the right people in the right seat...drive!<br /><br />But...I decided to read this book simply because of the publicity that it received and therefore it was impossible to ignore it. While Collins did an excellent work, he could have optimized it. Sometime I was under the impression that he is stating the obvious: to be a great leader you need a great staff and a good idea.....ok<br /><br />Guzman, Dror
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|After reading so many one-star reviews that called this film rubbish, I was curious to watch it and try to find out if this is really such an awful movie. Well, it is.  In fact, \\"awful\\" is too mild a word. \\"Abominable\\" is more like it. <br />Everything in this film is appalling. All the characters were badly cast. Mr. Bingley was a teenaged idiot. Mr. Bennett seemed to be on drugs most of the time or just senile. Mrs. Bennett looked and behaved like a fishmonger's wife, no manners whatsoever. Mr. Collins was humorless (capital offense!). Lady de Bourg looked like Marie Antoinette who had somehow escaped the guillotine and talked just like M. Keira Knightly spent 50% of her screen time trying to be cute, and the other 50% to be sexy by keeping her mouth half open in a clearly orgasmic expression (she was supposed to be Ms. Elisabeth Bennett, my goodness, who was anything but a sex-kitten!). But the worst of all was Mr. Darcy:  he couldn't act for the life of him, and he looked like a cross between a hound and Peter Lorre! In fact, all the moments of comic relief in this movie came from this non-entity of an actor. I laughed out loud when I saw him walking across the field in his open shirt, looking like Keanu Reeves in Constantine or in The Matrix, and I laughed again when he spat out from ONE corner of his mouth the line \\"You have bewitched me body and soul.\\"  Yuck! <br />I know somebody might argue that it is unfair to compare this film with the 6-hour A&E version, but then, with all the money that was available to them, they should have tried to match, if not surpass, some of the pivotal scenes. Try comparing the wonderful Netherfield ball scene in the A&E version, so charged with sexual tension, with an almost insolent yet refined Jennifer Ehle sparring with the love-sick Firth  and weaving in and out of the other dancers, with the same, but anemic one in this film, and you'll know what I mean. Worst yet: the liberties that both the director and the screenwritertook to \\"improve\\"on the original story were just preposterous and bizarre to say the least. For example, the very first scene showed Lizzie reading a book upside down WHILE walking (it was fortunate she did not walk into a pond or a tree); the first proposal became a shouting match with Lizzie working her mouth like a pump; Lizzie starting a conversation during church service and licking her fingers at table; Lady de Bourg visiting at night; Mr. Darcy entering Lizzie's room to deliver his letter, etc. And what was that scene with the pig with inflamed organs? And the room with nude sculptures? Clearly, they were trying to sex up the story. I wouldn't be surprised if their next project should be a porn version of Snow White. Oh, I forgot, someone did that already. <br />The whole film has the feel of a two-hour commercial for Nissan cars or Prada products, with the camera focusing almost obsessively on  Keira Knightly's face and CGI effects added to \\"enhance\\" the scenery (the flying geese in the pond scene are clearly one of such doubtful achievements). <br />A waste of time. Not the worst movie I have ever seen, but a pretty good runner-up. As to money, I congratulate myself for having to pay only 9 bucks for a previously-viewed copy from Blockbuster. Even that was too much for such a lousy film. The screenwriter should be banned from making another \\"adaptation\\" of any classic of literature for life and the director from making any new movie for ten years, until he acquires the good sense that only age can provide.
0312938640|5.0|In The Last Coyote, number 4 in Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series, the LAPD homicide detective finds himself in the cooker.  This is not an unusual place for Bosch to be as even his own colleagues call him \\"an outsider in an insiders job.\\"  But things are even more serious this time around.  LA is still recovering from an earthquake, and Bosch's cantilevered house has been condemned.  Bosch's girlfriend has left for Italy (a permanent move).  Bosch is also recovering from his own earthquake in a meltdown that caused him to put his boss through a glass window at the office.  The Last Coyote finds Bosch on forced leave and his return to the job is based on the findings of police psychologist, Dr. Carmen Hinojos.<br /><br />In Bosch's sessions with Dr Hinojos, one theme keeps coming up--the unsolved murder of his mother, Marjorie Lowe.  Lowe was a prostitute and lost Harry to an orphanage when the city determined she was an unfit mother.  She was trying to turn her life around and regain custody of 11 year old Harry when she was brutally murdered.  Lowe \\"knew\\" a number of police officers and men in high places, and it is obvious that there was a cover-up.  With his free time, Harry decides to try and solve this 33 year old case.  This is not always easy as some of the key players are dead and some have disappeared.  Also, he has to do it without a gun or a badge, which makes the situation even more dangerous and also makes witnesses more reluctant to talk.  As with all Connelly books, The Lost Coyote will keep you twisting until the end and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />Connelly is an incredible writer with a keen eye.  When Bosch discovers one of the original detectives that investigated his mother's death, he muses \\"Something about the old case was like a pebble in his shoe.  He had worked it over to the side where it didn't hurt when he walked.  But it was still there.  Bosch had to make him want to take it out.\\"  I also stumbled upon Connelly's website which enhanced the book even more with the many photos included that tie in with each book.  His books have enticed me to think about a trip to LA--something that never appealed to me before.<br /><br />I'm hooked enough on Connelly and Bosch that I have already started the next book, Trunk Music.  I'm not going to stop until I'm done them all.h enhanced the book even more with the many photos included that tie in with each book.

B00003CX97|5.0|After years of more intimate British films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's \\"Summertime\\", master director David Lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\", an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.<br /><br />The plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in Singapore, Col. Nicholson marches his ragged British company into a Japanese prisoner work camp in the Burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of \\"Colonel Bogey March\\" is first heard). The erudite Col. Saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge, a critical juncture between Rangoon and Malaysia. In a classic stand-off, Nicholson finally forces Saito to respect Geneva Convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. Upon his ironic Pyrrhic victory, Nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. Meanwhile, shortly after Nicholson's arrival, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a British commando mission led by do-or-die Maj. Warden and hesitant Lt. Joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. Through Peter Taylor's thoughtful film editing, the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel storylines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.<br /><br />Lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the Burmese jungle locations (filmed in Sri Lanka), the seamless integration of the two storylines, the masterful handing of the final scenes, and in particular, the gradual metamorphosis of Nicholson from a by-the-book British officer to Saito's willing collaborator. A frequent participant in Lean's films, Alec Guinness gives his career-best performance as Nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. As Shears, William Holden does what he did best in the 1950's, concurrently exuding natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then adding a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. The 68-year old Sessue Hayakawa came out of retirement to play Saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne lend sturdy support as Warden and Joyce respectively. With the same expert eye he lent to \\"Summertime\\", Jack Hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, both blacklisted at the time, wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. This is essential viewing.<br /><br />The two-disc 2000 Limited Edition DVD set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. There is a nearly hour-long documentary on Disc Two, \\"The Making of The Bridge on the River Kwai\\", produced for the DVD and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. There are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release, the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in Film 101 produced by USC grad students and introduced by Holden.

B000EYK4GW|5.0|For some reason, I never saw most of the Disney classic movies when I was growing up - but I'm certainly having a good time watching them all these years later.  Dumbo, of course, may be the most beloved Disney film of them all - despite the fact that it is relatively short (64 minutes), sports a pretty simplistic style of animation, and features a main character that never speaks a single word.  The film's popularity is due in large part to the story itself, as there is a little bit of Dumbo in all of us.  At some time, we've all been embarrassed by our appearance, laughed at and snubbed by those around us, and been made to feel like a complete loser.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story already.  Poor little Dumbo, with his big ears, is ridiculed and called a freak by the other elephants, harassed by kids going in to see the circus, separated from his mother, and eventually made into a clown, the very embodiment of his unhappy life.  Only little Timothy Mouse befriends him, and his spirit of optimism and commitment to help Dumbo prove himself are needed more than ever when things go from bad to worse.  In the end, the very thing that makes Dumbo different turns out to be the source of his greatest strength.  The message of the film is pretty simple: believe in yourself, even when others put you down and, for heaven's sake, don't make fun of someone just because he looks different.  Dumbo is also a story about love, particularly the love between a mother and child, and the importance of friendship.<br /><br />Classic Disney films such as this are both wonderful and remarkable - yet so many of them are also sad.  I imagine that children, while they will certainly understand the themes of this story, don't connect to the film on the same emotional level as I do as an adult.  I really got emotional watching this - right from the start, with the sadness exuded by Mrs. Jumbo as she watches children being delivered to seemingly every one but her.  It's tough watching Dumbo suffer ridicule and embarrass himself further by tripping over his big ears, suffer a cruel separation from his mother, and mope around with those tears spilling out of his big blue eyes, but I made it through all of that OK.  Then came the scene where he visits his mother in her solitary confinement.  If Leonard Maltin can admit that this film makes him cry every time he watches it, so can I.  I don't know how anyone can get through that visitation scene without shedding at least one tear.<br /><br />I said the animation was relatively simplistic, but that does not mean it isn't spellbinding, nor does it mean you won't encounter any scenes that are rather stunning in detail.  Some of the professionals interviewed in a 15-minute featurette included on the DVD do a great job of pointing out the most remarkable scenes (and everyone has something to say about the Pink Elephant sequence, which is just bizarre and certainly memorable).  Other special features include an audio commentary by film historian John Canemaker, a short, one-minute introduction to the film by Walt Disney himself, a photo gallery of conception art and storyboards, a video of the song \\"Baby Mine\\" performed by Jim Brickman with Kassie DePalva, and two short cartoons, Elmer Elephant and The Flying Mouse.  Additional bonus materials aimed more specifically at young viewers are Sing Along Songs for Look Out for Mr. Stork and Casey Junior, a DVD storybook which children can read along with, and a \\"My First Circus\\" game that teaches children about the different kinds of animals normally found in a circus.<br /><br />In a perfect world, Disney would just send a free copy of Dumbo to every set of parents in the country.  Since that isn't economically feasible, I hope that as many parents as possible do make Dumbo a part of their children's young lives.  This classic animated film is everything you would expect from Walt Disney - and more.g Dumbo suffer ridicule and embarrass himself further by tripping over his big ears, suffer a cruel separation from his mother, and mope around with those tears spilling out of his big blue eyes, but I made it through all of that OK.

B00005JOVH|5.0|I'm a fan of the comic book, particularly the Dark Phoenix saga. I also appreciated the X-men movies because they brought to life my childhood heroes. I respected the changes they made because I realized that that's what would best translate to the big screen.  <br /> <br />X-men 3, to me, is the best of the trilogy eventhough it is not faithful to the Dark Phoenix saga. It's most action-packed 1 huor and 40 minutes I've ever seen in a movie. Although I respect the opinion of critics and geek fans, I guess the Memorial Day record proves that they were wrong.
0780622553|5.0|There's more than a little something in this for everyone.  There is the dark, gritty city, film noir all over, with superb costuming and sets.  You've got mysterious people, who are not us, but are very much like us.  There's human experimentation, and wriggly-critter alien abduction.  There are the bigger artistic/philosophical questions of identity, purpose, and ultimate direction.  There's suspense, a complex whodunit, a mysterious and apparently unreachable destination, and a huge climactic battle. There's a little T&A, and a little bit of violence and action.  There's all of this and more in Dark City.<br /><br />Right away it looked like \\"The Marathon Man,\\" with stark dark bathroom and the dark apartment beyond.  I detected plenty of \\"The Matrix,\\" with the sets, costuming, and the ubiquity of the ringing phone.  The aliens themselves looked surprisingly like the \\"bug\\" sucked out of Neo's navel.  The Australian location certainly contributed to more than a little visual and conceptual spillover to \\"The Matrix.\\"<br /><br />There was plenty \\"Blade Runner\\" in this film as well, and \\"Metropolis.\\"  The Strangers were more than once extremely reminiscent of the cenobites from the \\"Hellraiser\\" series, right down to the bald, white heads, the black leather outfits and the chattering teeth. I got quite a few \\"City of Lost Children\\" twinges as well, especially the scenes in the lowest parts of the city, on the water.<br /><br />And there's the relentless noir aspect of the film.  The darkness, the moisture-coated industrial texture of everything, the rust browns, dusky black, grimy grays, wet outside and dusty inside.  The costuming is commensurately noir, right down to the detectives' fedoras, the Dick-Tracy-style police uniforms, the suspenders, everything.  The two women in the film--Connelly as the wife, and that all too brief blond hooker--are deliciously young and tarted up fully, as you'd expect in noir.<br /><br />Fans of Kiefer Sutherland will enjoy his Dr. Schreber character, about as far as could get from the superhard uber-agent Jack Bauer he's now most known for.  How cool was it to see Richard O'Brien once again, into a role uniquely suited to him.  The same goes for everyone's favorite Gyro Captain, Bruce Spence.<br /><br />Now, Jennifer Connelly just didn't work for me in this film.  She didn't pull off the molten-sexy club crooner, and her acting as the confused wife just didn't work either.  (I was reminded of the also not-quite-convincing sultriness of Isabella Rossellini`s Dorothy Vallens in \\"Blue Velvet.\\")  In the end, tending toward the sappy, she and Murdoch apparently hook up once again, that unspoken destiny of love bringing them together, much like Warren Beatty and Julie Christie (and her wild-ass hair) at the end of \\"Heaven Can Wait.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, the film was satisfying.  As I watched, I was pulled into Murdoch's quest to find Shell Beach, to find the way out of the city, and in the end to find out exactly what was going on.  I feared an overly artistic, cryptic and needlessly complex symbolic solution, something more meaningful as an artistic and political statement, but which leaves a lot to be desired for the viewer who wants only to see a story progress toward a resolution.  And the film came through on that.  How cool was it for Murdoch and Bumstead (William Hurt) to break through the wall to find--quite unpleasantly--the vacuum of deep space?  And bam, there's the shot of the endlessly morphing city floating through the void, with the subterranean machines of control below, to my mind an awful lot like the Cloud City in \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\"<br /><br />And the end, it fit too, just right.  Murdoch gets what he wants, which is knowledge and control, and his simple wish to get toward a place of remembered serenity.  He achieves this using the Strangers' technology.  The Strangers remain, not simply all eliminated by Murdoch, so cohabitation follows, and maybe the Strangers will evenfind what they're looking for.  But there is no sappy, glorious return to Earth, nor is there even any Earth mentioned.  That would be excessive Hollywood glop, and I'm so glad it wasn't there.  They're all still out there, somewhere in the vast eternity of space, and that's that.<br /><br />I know I'm a killjoy for pointing these out, but for me there were a couple of disconnects: 1) In the cases where Murdoch manages to kill a couple of the Strangers pursuing him, how is it these Strangers were not able to use their tuning skills to save themselves?  Murdoch discovers his tuning abilities when they emerge unbidden as part of his instinctive needs to flee and be safe.  One would have to assume that long-familiar tuning users would be able to put their skills to use instantly to save their own lives.  2) If the city moves and lurches and morphs every night, how is it that no one ever gets squashed amid all of that lurching real estate?<br /><br />Overall, the effects were quite good.  The big telepathic/telekinetic fight scene was just about right, with good sound, great effects, and sufficiently large in scale to make narrative sense, but not so big as to be ridiculous.  Sound quality was excellent throughout.<br /><br />Notes on this DVD:  I found the extra features interesting, but not compelling.  The bios of the primary stars are interesting, but in no way comprehensive.  The bio information on the crew is a bit more interesting, but is one-dimensional, offering only a photo and text.  The set design is interesting, but is a simple collection of drawings.  As always, it's very interesting to see the official trailer only after viewing the film, and see how different the film is from what it is as advertised.  There is no blooper reel, no deleted scenes, no alternative endings.  I found the commentary to be rather bland.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a film I enjoyed very much, and will add to my personal collection.ers will even find what they're looking for.

I found the commentary to be rather bland. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  This is a film I enjoyed very much, and will add to my personal collection.
B00001W9G0|1.0|When I first saw this film as a college student I thought it was ok, but not great.  Now that I've seen it for the second time, I don't even think it is ok.  I guess when I was younger, I either missed or wasn't so bothered by the way Robert Redford's character treats Barbara Streisand's, not to mention the way he treats his daughter.  He just leaves Katie right at the point when he finds out she's pregnant with his child.  And at the end of the movie it appears that he has never kept in touch with either of them.  This bothered me to the point where I just couldn't have any sympathy or any positive views about Redford's character and, without this, the movie doesn't work at all.
B00005JOVH|4.0|This was a good X-Men movie, but not as good as the 2nd one.  The danger room was nice to see for a change.  Angel was a nice addition.  Where was Nightcrawler?<br /><br />The franchise is in trouble because the story line is getting weaker and repetative.  Magneto has been over used, if there is a 4th X-Men movie, I really hope that Magneto is not in the next movie.  There are so many other X-Men stories that would make fantastic movies.  Apocalypse.  Days of Future Past.  The list goes on and on.  More than likely, this will be the last X-Men as we know it.  Wolverine will get a spin-off movie, but it will most like be messed up because it will be a prequel flick instead of a newer story.  Wolverine has a lot of potential, but they need the right people to make the right story.  As for the X-Men, I'd love to see a 4th movie, but Marvel needs to really pick a character as a villian that hasn't been used yet.  I'd recommend Apocalypse or Mr. Sinister as the next X-Men villans, anything else and the 4th film will be the last one.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|I gave it 2 stars because, as a lesbian, I do want to see more film stories of gay and lesbian people, but the reason it did not rate a higher score with me was because I felt so angry and frustrated, both by the characters and by the story itself and how it is presented. <br /> <br />I know what it was like in the 60's, I lived in the era in which this film was set. <br /> <br />While we did not have the tolerance we have now--it was not impossible for two unmarried men to live together. Many did. Some were gay, some were not. Gays did have to stay in the closet then, but these characters, don't even have the guts to do that! I think their lack of backbone aggravated me about as much as anything in this film. <br /> <br />They never do anything to make things better between them. <br /> <br />The other highly unsatisfactory thing about this film is that the men are portrayed as if being homosexual is just a choice. They have no obvious problems in being with women. <br /> <br />Nor do we get any backstory on them regarding sexual orientation when they were growing up. <br /> <br />The sex between them is very sudden, with no lead-in, no hint whatsoever that homosexuality has ever even crossed either of them's minds. <br /> <br />Jack is made to be the \\"gayer\\" of the two, in that he does eventually get it on with a couple of other guys. Ennis never does. Yet even Jack marries, fathers a child, and remains married. He and his wife drift apart somewhat, but no more so than a straight couple might. <br /> <br />Both Jack and Ennis are portrayed as losers. Ennis never makes a decent wage. Jack marries into money, but his father in law barely manages to tolerate him. <br /> <br />The two lead actors do their parts well, and there's beautiful Wyoming scenery, but this film really did no great service to the gay community as far as I am concerned
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Let me tell you how just how good \\"North and South\\" is: My aunt decided to put it on for just a few minutes before going to work, and ended up staying home from work to watch the whole thing. My aunt is a loan-broker. If you, too, would like to risk your job and thousands of dollars because you simply HAVE to know if the gorgeous yet volatile mill-owner ends up with the annoying, straight-laced parson's daughter then by all means buy \\"North and South\\" today.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell (who also wrote \\"Wives and Daughters\\", dying after 800 pages but just before the end, for which I shall never forgive her) \\"North and South\\" follows the adventures of the allegedly fiery Margaret Hale as she moves form the sleepy South of England to the fast-moving, soot-covered North. I say \\"allegedly fiery\\" because she is played by Daniela Denby-Ashe, who is the series' one weak point. It's not that she's bad--she isn't. But she doesn't really display the strong spirit the script demands. She's pretty, alright, but she lacks emotional weight, and in several scenes where Margaret is supposed to be in turmoil Denby-Ashe just looks vacant. Normally a less-than-stellar performance on behalf of the female lead would sink a story, but then most series don't have Richard Armitage playing the male lead. Coming off like Hugh Jackman's older brother, Armitage is fantastic and makes the story truly addictive. His John Thorton is the lower-class Mr. Darcy, and he tempers the mill master's anger with shades of true humanity. My rating stays five stars because of Armitage.<br /><br />Lending fine support are Anna Maxwell Martin (also excellent in the recent \\"Bleak House\\") as Margaret's lower class friend, Brendan Coyle as a combative union supporter, and some truly gorgeous music and cinematography. For all those Brit-lit geeks out there \\"North and South\\" is a home-run and not to be missed. I haven't seen anything so good since \\"Berkeley Square\\", and if that doesn't motivate you, my BBC-loving brethren, nothing will.<br /><br />GRADE: Aotivate you, my BBC-loving brethren, nothing will.  <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Today, when I want to watch Brokeback Mountain again, I found the DVD skips, and freezes, and I am hardly able to go through the movie? <br /> <br />Why did this happen? That's because I have watched this movie almost everyday since I bought it, it is ruined beyond belief.  <br /> <br />This movie is a masterpiece for emotion, drama, and ideas. It also exist in another level, showing love that most of the world today is not capable of producing. After this review, I plan to go out and buy another copy. This movie is phenomenal!

That's about it..

0375831002|5.0|Like so many other reviewers here, I read a lot and all over the place - literature, sci-fi, mystery/crime, even a romance or two (it pisses off the hubby when I read in the bathroom, standing up, brushing my teeth...)  <br /> <br />I, like my kindred-spirit-reviewers here, am always looking for that special book - the one that makes you say, \\"WOW\\"!  The one with the je ne sais quoi, intangible quality, that makes you feel that you've lived it, right along with the characters. <br /> <br />Well, believe me, this one is it.  It is not a young adult book.  It's an everyone-should-read-it book.  I put it down and, surprisingly, cried for a couple of minutes.  I don't do that. <br /> <br />As it's been said before (but not often) and will be said again in the future (but not often enough):   <br />PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!!
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Conventional wisdom is that this is Dire Strait's least successful album but I actually think the opposite is true. The groove the band creates and sustains across the album is amazing, the songwriting is gentle, intelligent, humorous. This is Dire Straits at their most sophisticated without any of those silly chart toppers or over-produced bombast that plague their later efforts. This CD has aged very well.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Once again, this is an awesome show that you should see.  Make sure to watch the first season so you know and understand the characters.
B0000025DV|5.0|This album is quite possibly Jeff Lynne's masterwork - a blending of rock and real (not synthesized) strings into a series of amazing songs.  Sure, here and there, the lyrics are fluffy confections but in them I see where he was experimenting with \\"voices-as-instruments\\" ala Esquivel's work (in which the syllablic singing subbing for instruments got distracting, hearing four-part harmony \\"zoo-zoo-zoo-zooie, zooie!\\" or \\"boink! boink!\\" got too cutsie, distracting and tiresome quickly - Jeff Lynne pulls that idea off more cleanly and with less distraction)  Lynne got to Esquivel's level of silliness with the idiotic, meaningless repetition of \\"Brruce!\\" in the hit \\"Don't Bring me Down\\" from a later album.  That juvenile \\"I'm-a-genius-and-you'll-take-what-I-give you\\" attitude is happily missing from this album - a genius at work who doesn't yet fatuously consider himself to be a genius. <br /> <br />I bought a used copy of this album, thus assume it was one of the earlier releases of the CD version.  If the order of songs given here is correct, CBS has corrected an error on older copies.  The original double album had 17 tracks across four sides on two LP's.  The older CD combined \\"Steppin' Out\\" and \\"Standin' in the Rain\\" into a single track, destroying album continuity and removing one of the album's best features - the \\"Concerto for a Rainy Day\\"  The \\"Concerto\\" was comprised of four tracks from side three of the album:  <br /> <br />\\"Standin' in the Rain\\" <br />\\"Big Wheels\\" <br />\\"Summer and Lightning\\" <br />\\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" <br /> <br />In the manner of the \\"concept album\\" of the 70's, the idea worked - four interconnected songs acting as the expression of a single idea.  If the table of contents I see on the current page is correct, CBS appears to have inserted \\"Standin' in the Rain\\" as its own track (track 10) which, while repeating the song (it's still included in the \\"Steppin' Out\\" compilation [track 9]) it restores the existence and correct order of the \\"Concerto.\\"I'm glad to see that gross error has been addressed as the \\"Concerto\\" was my favorite part of the entire album.  I may buy again just to get a corrected copy.
020530902X|5.0|Roughly 80 years ago, William Strunk wrote a small textbook for students in his English Composition class. He wrote it with the intention of creation a short and accessible reference for his students, one of whom - E. B. White, author of the children's classic \\"Charlotte's Web\\" - would revise it almost thirty years later for publication to the general college market.<br /><br />Since its inception, \\"The Elements of Style\\" has been the definitive text on clear written communication. It contains explicit guidelines that can easily be followed by anyone, and lays down the law in the form of 22 Elementary Rules of Usage and Elementary Principles of Composition (my favorite of which, \\"Omit needless words,\\" I couldn't resist quoting in my own book).<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, from the perspective of the aspiring writer (who generally has neither an abundance of time nor money), the book is short (can be leisurely read in a couple of hours) and inexpensive (affordable for even the starving student).<br /><br />This book is highly, highly recommended for anyone who considers taking pen to paper.<br /><br />Danny Iny<br /><br />Author of \\"Ordinary Miracles - Harness the power of writing and get your point across!\\" (ISBN 1-4116-7252-6)

B000002GYW|5.0|First of all, let me say that this is the most cohesive and consistantly good album the Eagles ever produced. Every song is good, and thematically it all holds together very well. <br />In my opinion, the band was at their peak at this time and would never again do anything as good as this. <br />Now, let me address the review given by Rob O'Conner , whoever he is..... 1. Gram Parsons DID NOT invent country rock (and I despise that term). If you'll go back and listen to the Monkees (yes, the Monkees) you'll see that Michael Nesmith was doing that stuff before Gram Parsons made his appearance. And before Nesmith, it was the Dillards. You might even give credit to a young Ricky Nelson, as well. Gram Parsons invented country rock, my A##!! 2. The Eagles harmonies included more than just Henley and Frey. People tend to forget there were two other original Eagles, The great Randy Meisner and the multi instrumentalist Bernie Leadon. They could both sing, and write, and play and harmonize, for God's sake!! Don Henley and Glenn Frey didn't make the Eagles what they were(are) by themselves.... they had some mighty good help. People would do well to remember that. <br />The only reason Henley and Frey became the only original Eagles left is because they were the only ones who could stand to be around themselves. Anyway, DESPERADO is a mighty fine album. And FOUR people played on it.
0767811070|5.0|This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings. <br />This movie truly captures the struggle millions of African Americans go through. As we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto, to when they are old enough to get out, they still seem to be the same. Their customs dont change, simply because of their surrounding, guns, liquor, poverty, and crime. They have no other option than do join in.  <br />When dough boy's(Ice Cube) brother Ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto. The whole family feels as this a way for them to escape it also, so everyone is supporting him. Until a tragedy is brought upon the family. This story truly proves nothings good until finally out of the hood for these boys.  <br />
0446677450|1.0|I have read this bood and watched this man on public television. I am constantly waiting for the goods to be delivered and it Never does. There is absolutely no plan to make us rich,only continuously babbling and no info. I am amazed this is a best seller. It was not rated well by consumer reports financial team.I understand why.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ten times more entertaining and interesting than Angel, Buffy, Battlestar Gallactica, than any recent show of it's genre or out, Joss Whedon's Firefly is an odd but unexpectedly exciting combination of western bravado, mystery, sc-fi action/adventure and plain good laughs.  <br />  <br />Oh, and don't forget the small, well-administered doses of romantic tension and well-packaged sentimentality. <br /> <br />It's for those who can appreciate smartly written dialogue, well played roles and excellent directing - most likely the types who'd enjoy The Simpsons, Desperate Housewives, Family Guy, Angel, Buffy , Kill Bill and the like.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|any flaws in this movie are obvious. it's not at all a bad movie, and I personally like it because I love the Final Fantasy series of games. the rendering was beautiful, and the voice acting was not bad (it was better sounding and better matched in the Japanese version in my opinion). some of the characters were abstractly placed but I didn't mind (but Cait Sith... why a Scot?). You need to have played the game to understand this well, otherwise it'll just be plain confusing. You will get lost too easily if you haven't ever touched a FF game. needless to say, it is a wonderful movie. Good job on the part of SquareEnix.
B00005JOVH|3.0|X-Men 3 is good.  It has fantastic action, summer blockbusting special effects and great acting.  The only problem is that the story is very dull and mostly consentrates around Jean Grey.  There are so many new mutants to introduce in this movie that the director has to introduce them briefly and we don't get to see much of them in action.  I was also very surprised that most of the main characters of X-Men got killed off so easily and so quickly.<br /><br />I didn't like the 1st and 2nd X-Men films that much, the 3rd however, I found to be a bit better and more enjoyable.  This was a very good attempt at the franchise.  One thing that really dissapointed me about this movie is that the Sentinels were only in a computer simulation, you couldn't see them and they were only in it for less than 2 minutes which really sucks!  I would have really liked this movie if the Sentinels were fully in it and not in a computer simulation.  I wanted to see some really cool sentinel versus x-men battles.  Maybe next time.
B000060MMI|5.0|My first experience with Flogging Molly was actually in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, which featured \\"Drunken Lullabies\\" on the playlist. I heard the banjo intro and actually started laughing, but by the end of the song I was shaking my fist to the chorus. That was about 2 years ago. I bought this CD finally on St. Patrick's Day this year, and I was singing the songs with friends while consuming copious amounts of Killian's Irish Red. I absolutely love this album. So full of emotion and balls at the same time, this album is truly a masterpiece. The songs that I particularly loved are Drunken Lullabies, What's Left Of The Flag, If I Ever Leave This World Alive, Rebels Of the Sacred Heart, Death Valley Queen, The Rare Ould Times, and The Son Never Shines(On Closed Doors). This was my first adventure into Flogging Molly, so when I buy \\"Within A Mile Of Home\\" and \\"Swagger\\", they may not hold that special place in my green, white, and orange heart that \\"Drunken Lullabies\\" did.
0380789035|5.0|This book is just a pure joy to read, from start to finish. It's one of the hardest books to put down that one could ever read. I made at least 10 other people buy this book and they all agreed that it was impossible to stop once one started reading it. Gaiman's style is dark, humorous, fantastical, and utterly refreshing and original. He is such a skilled and unique author. The book isn't merely entertaining and thrilling but also carries much more meaning and depth than the majority of science fiction/fantasy books ever written. Lovers of mythology will be especially intrigued by this book in which countless gods from different pantheons (Norse, Roman, Greek, and more etc..) appear. All of the characters are wonderfully brought to life and all are memorable, even the ones that are minor.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The DVD hasn't been released as of today. I've seen the film 3 times. The first time I saw it I wasn't impressed. The more I thought about the film though, the more I wanted to see it again. I saw it again tonight, and liked it better than the first two times, and have derived more and more from the story with each viewing. It will likely become a cult classic.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed the A&E version, I always felt that the actress who played Charlotte seemed too pretty to be stuck with Mr. Collins. In this version, Charlotte's speech really was in accordance with the time period. I felt her desperation and relief when she told Lizzie the news of her engagement. I thought that was an extremely enlightening scene and telling of the time.
0060755598|2.0|This book may be lauded by professionals and amateurs alike, but the author is so god-awfully wordy that I couldn't get beyond the second chapter.  I actually tossed it across the room in frustration--which I NEVER do to a book.  It reads like an infomercial or sales letter where the main tactic is interminable repetition.  If the redundancies were removed, it would be one-third to one-half its current length--and a MUCH better book.   <br /> <br />I'm disappointed that frustration and boredom will not allow me to get to the excellent lessons I've heard it contains.  Perhaps the author could give it over to a good proofreader or editor for condensing and offer us a third version.
B00005JOVH|3.0|Learning how to keep an audience enthralled is one of the essential curves for good cinema. For me, it's all about the characters. Always has been, always will be. And on many levels, this third installment in the X-Men movie series succeeds.<br /><br />After having watched Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) die in the second film, I felt that the series directors, screenwriters, producers, etc., were beginning to understand what audiences need. But then we have Dr. Grey return in X-Men: The Last Stand. The emptiness of her passing was now miraculously refilled as we learn that Jean is not in control of her faculties. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) had previously held Jean's mind in check by separating her destructive side from her more controllable one. Jean was (is) a level five mutant, one with unlimited power. But with that power comes a fractured mind. Something called \\"The Phoenix\\" (uh-boy, not that name again) lives inside Jean's head and refuses to be reigned in. A path of destruction and death reels before Jean as The Phoenix part of her mind takes control.<br /><br />Against this we have the discovery (by humans, of course) of a \\"cure\\" for the mutant gene. This cure lives (naturally) inside the body of a little mutant boy who's kept out of harms way at a new facility that rests on old Alcatraz Island in San Francisco.<br /><br />Magneto (Ian McKellen) sees this as a threat to everything he stands for. It's only a matter of time, he believes, until the government makes it mandatory for all mutants to be \\"cured\\" of their \\"disease\\".<br /><br />A personal, social, governmental, and worldwide movement begins on three fronts. First is Magneto's group of mutants who want this \\"cure\\" threat destroyed before it falls into the wrong hands. Secondly, we have the government who says that the vaccinations are strictly voluntary and want to protect the child/cure. And in-between them we have the X-Men. Battling amongst themselves as much as any external threats, we begin to see the extreme price the X-Men are willing to pay in order for peace.<br /><br />New mutants abound in this third film. First, we have something called \\"The Beast\\" (Kelsey Grammer), a blue cowardly lion with anger management issues that acts as a Presidential aide between mutants and humans. I don't know why, but I half expected to see Lilith from Cheers come stomping in and pull him out of a scene by his ear. Go figure. Secondly, we have The Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), a bulky ...um ...guy who gets rolling and can't be stopped. And finally, we see Angel (Ben Foster), a winged boy whose inability to accept the \\"cure\\" ends up saving someone very close to him.<br /><br />Although this film is subtitled \\"The Last Stand\\", I seriously doubt if it'll be \\"The Last Film.\\" An end scene with a \\"cured\\" Magneto opens up an entirely new miasma of questions: Does the cure really work? Or is Magneto immune? Will mutants need to be re-vaccinated every so often? I feel pretty confident that X-Men movie aficionados haven't seen the last of Wolverine or Storm.ts, we begin to see the extreme price the X-Men are willing to pay in order for peace.  <br /> <br />New mutants abound in this third film.

B0009MDPYW|1.0|Very boring horror movie that has Keanu Reeves playing a Sam Spade like occult investigator who helps a police officer in death of her twin sister. The story sounds simple enough but it get convoluted in all the supernatural happening that is going on and the screenplay really does not bother to explain itself in those occurrences. The special effects are good but some of them are repetitive and some visuals are not that well done. The acting is decent for a movie of this kind with Rachel Weisz proving once again to be one of the most versatile and talented actresses of her generation. Her performance is actually too good for this film because it demands a better showcase than this film. Her character is strong enough to hold this film by herself but with the inconsistent writing that is in the screenplay, she is reduced to carrying Keanu on her shoulders while he is trying to figure out on which film he's in. Which leads to the film's biggest problem and that is Keanu Reeves himself. He's miscast in the role of John Constantine and a better actor would have been able to show more of his sides than Keanu was able to do. Keanu just comes a cross as a jerk and that would have been alright if he at least showed some humanity but Keanu can't balance that out and he just comes across really bad. A better actor would have done more but with Keanu, you really can't expect much and you don't get anything here. That hurts the creditability that this movie had for the main character and it hurts the way you see the movie as a whole. The direction lacks focus and some scenes don't hold well with the whole film. <br /> <br />Worth a rental for Rachel Weisz's great performance and some of the special effects but not worth owning  <br />
B00005BIIP|5.0|Well, purhasing this little \\"dainty\\" nearly cost me a divorce ,but sometimes you have to make sacrifices..... I love the music on this CD, which is a collection of B- side single releases. This is Steven Wilson at his most vulnerable. There are some very moving slower pieces on this, which is the reason I listen to music. It should be an emotional experience and this is! \\"Buying New Soul\\" is quickly becoming my favorite PT song. I enjoy every tune on this disc, from the instrumentals to the extended version of \\"Even Less.\\" I feel the price I paid was worth it to not miss out on these timeless gems. I wouldn't gamble on just any group, but I knew that this would be a winner because everything I've heard by Porcupine Tree has been of the HIGHEST quality and very satisfying listening. It's like a void in my psyche is being filled.....
B00005RHGL|4.0|This movie is not in the same class as Lonesome Dove or Dances with Wolves, nor was it intended to be, nevertheless, I absolutely loved it. It is easy to watch, has some great actors, and a darn good movie to boot. Did I mention good actors? It is simple, but not shallow.     I realize this is not a particularly accurate reflection of Wyatt Earp or Doc Holliday, but it is VERY entertaining.      Val Kilmer plays a very interesting and cool Doc Holliday, and Kurt Russell is great as a strong and steady Wyatt Earp. Doc Holliday's response to Johnny Ringo's pistol slinging in the saloon is one of my favorite movie scenes ever.    I haven't see this movie in several years, but I know I probably watched it 5 or 6 times over the period of a couple years, and I enjoyed it every time.
B00005JOSS|5.0|Good God, \\"J. Q. Public!\\" I am so sick of seeing these stupid reviews for all these movies you have not seen - obviously, since you never speak about the story or plot but rather your own personal politics regarding what you think you know the movie is going to say or be like. And to add insult to injury, you base this on what studio is releasing the movie. You don't review any of these movies, you review movie studios! That is insanity! (Also, every movie in his review log is reviewed a month before its release and he always says these movie \\"have no script,\\" like a comic book geek is one to discriminate about a film's script even if he had seen the film.)  You're own problems aside, there should be some sort of ethical concern about someone who plasters 1 star reviews over products he is not familiar with. I have not seen this movie, so normally my review would not be here yet. I'm posting this to get this off my chest and I'm giving it 5 stars to cancel out JQ's unfair and ignorant review. This movie may indeed suck, but it won't be for any of the reason this guy, with too much time on his hands and too many stupid grudges against movies studios and comic books, says.
0689835604|3.0|This book was highly recommended by a friend of mine who's son is the same age as mine.  My son liked it for about a day and then he was bored with it.  He loves the Sandra Boynton books - he has a bunch of them and is constantly bringing one to me to read to him.
0312330537|5.0|Shantaram is a beautiful novel written by a foreigner who has seen India from his eyes...especially Bombay, the toughest city for survival. Linbaba is not a character, not fiction but a man who loved the challenge the city provided him, along with came love, bounding for Indian people. I really loved reading it, the novel is more beautiful because of Prabu in Linbaba's life, and the pages come to life by his innocent charm and honest laughs. It could be that I myself an Indian felt flattered by reading it cause this is the first time I came across a foreigner \\"Gora\\" acquaint our lives and not only befriend us but lived among us and saw us from the inside. The author's reflections of India are so positive even the most shadowy businesses (gangsters, drugs etc.) are shown with a reality in their characters, not only they are humans but they also possess certain qualities which we've never heard or read ever before. The good part is that it's not fiction, it's all so real. It has the power of Indian people and author did nothing to hide it infact he flashed it. May be I'm being patriotic and the love for my country speaks in my review but I must say that if anyone wants to know....what is India...what are its people.....what actually is the life in India then read Shantaram! The book is so complete and thorough, charismatic and consuming that you won't even notice.... when you started it and when you finished it!! Books like these are not written everyday.....a lifetime book! <br /> <br />
0618164413|5.0|This book is my daughter's absolute favorite.  The simplistic but clearly written narration just sucks her in.  Although I love the book I sometimes want to read her something new or different at bedtime but she won't have it.  The only story that doesn't really fit is 'George Learns the Alphabet' although even that has given her an idea of how letters make words and words make stories.  She would rather read this book than any of her Dora stories and that's saying a lot!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I loved every song on the Try! album. The fact that it was recorded live was a great touch. The first time I played it, I was crusing along down the highway blaring the cd. It made me feel as if I was actually there! John Mayer has definetly progressed from \\"pop star\\" to extremely talented musician!
B00005YUAC|5.0|This 1973 album was the first by English prog band Camel and features their distinctive brand of progressive rock with subtle jazz-rock textures.  Although this debut (like so many others) has a sound that was not yet fully developed and is harder rocking than their other albums, enough of the Camel sound is in place that it makes for great listening.<br /><br />The musicians on this debut comprise the classic Camel lineup including great guitarist Andy Latimer (vocals on Slow Yourself Down and Separation); keyboardist Peter Bardens (Hammond organ, mellotron, VCS3, acoustic piano, and vocals on Never Let Go), great drummer Andy Ward; and bassist Doug Ferguson (vocals on Mystic Queen and Curiousity.  All of the guys are fantastic musicians and the vocals are not bad at all, although they do not seem very confident about their vocal abilities.  Andy Latimer is a great guitarist and easily quotes from range of styles.  I also like Pete's use of the synthesizers and the mellotron - he was a very tasteful player and knew exactly where certain sounds worked best on this album.  I guess it is worth noting that synthesizer use is pretty scarce on this album, although synthesizers would be used a lot on subsequent albums.  Sadly Pete Bardens passed away in 2002, and this reissued album was dedicated to him.<br /><br />The seven tracks on the album are all in the 4-7 minute range and are great examples of Camels jazzy, yet very English, brand of progressive rock.  In fact, the instrumental track Six Ate is probably the best illustration on the album of Camel's ability to seamlessly mix jazzy and prog styles together.  For those of that are wondering, there is a rock side to Camel on this debut, which really comes through with Andy's guitar work - especially on the thunderous and riff-heavy Separation and instrumental track Arubaluba.  Other tracks that are great include the spacey Mystic Queen, and my personal favorite Never Let Go, which features haunting parts played on the acoustic guitar and a ton of glorious mellotron with string setting, before breaking into a vigorous rock workout.  Believe it or not, Never Let Go features a sprightly mellotron solo.  In that this instrument was notoriously difficult to play, it was never used as a solo instrument but more as a sustained backdrop.  I guess it shows you just how good Pete was.  The remaining tracks are also excellent and feature tight musicianship.<br /><br />This remastered album features excellent sound quality, along with the restored cover art, a few band photos, and loads of liner notes.  There are two bonus tracks including a single version of Never Let Go and a 19'01\\" live track entitled Homage to the God of Light.  Homage to the God of Light was recorded on October 29, 1974 at the Marquee Club.  The live track is pretty well recorded and is a great jam.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great Camel album and is very highly recommended along with Mirage (1974); my personal favorite, The Snow Goose (1975); Moonmadness (1976); and Rain Dances (1977), which features Richard Sinclair on bass/lead vocals.acoustic guitar and a ton of glorious mellotron with string setting, before breaking into a vigorous rock workout.

0345440900|5.0|This book is filled with commonsense solutions!  At 7 months, my son started having fits in his crib so I started Tracy's method for handling this problem and within two days he was back to sleeping peacefully in his crib.  The advice she gives on how each baby is different was so helpful in determining how to handle my baby's unique needs.  I love this book!
0156027321|5.0|This book was written from a very interesting perspective.  It is very well written and once you get into it, it is very difficult to  put down.  I will not reveal any spoilers but here is a brief overview: this is a story of an Indian child that just \\"loves God.\\" His expression of this love is shown by his active participation in Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. <br /> <br />Later in the book, during a voyage to America by sea, he finds himself in the middle of the ocean with nobody except a Bengal Tiger. <br /> <br />This book is funny, horrifying, and most of all it is surprising and clever.  I would certainly suggest it to anyone and I must admit that I will probably end up reading it again later in life.
B000000W5H|5.0|this is a great rockin album by our favorite boys I like goats head soup but if it didn't excist I think that this would make 5 amazing albums in a row everything here is good maybe it is only rock n roll this time but hell you have mick taylor's last stand here doing what he does best and rock n roll is great stuff so i'm lovin this one.
B000001FS3|5.0|Probably one of the best albums I've heard in my life. U2  has proved that they were one of the greatest bands of the 80s, 90s, and the present. <br /> <br />This fantastic album executes their musical talent and amazing choice and blend of lyrics superbly. It's one of those albums that you'll listen for many years to come. Released in 1987, it is still nearly unmatched today. <br /> <br />Of course, 'With or without you' is the best song, with soothing, touching lyrics accompanied by a melodious tune. In fact, the last scene in Friends nearly used that song, and it would have been perfect. I can only think of a few songs in the same genre that would come close; the likes of 'Yellow' by Coldplay and 'The Boys of summer' by Don Henley. <br /> <br />Anyway, 'The Joshua Tree' is an album that is wonderful music to anyone's ears, and I recommend it to just about anyone, whether you listen to U2 or not. It sets a new standard.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is excellent, so all you people who badmouth it should really rethink what you are saying.  The Problem is that lateralus got WAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION.  I agree that the album has some soft spots to it, but they fit on the album nicely.  Vicarious is one of the best songs Tool has ever written. People who want to badmouth this album should really listen to it a few times first.  My point is Stop comparing snd SIT BACK AND ENJOY.
B0000028PI|5.0|Although I strongly agree with the other reviews I though I'd shed some light on this album that some people who listen to it may not know or realize.<br /><br />Alice wrote this album after he became a Christian! This album is him basicly giving Satan the finger, Alice is pissed off! He is letting off years of torment here. The reason this album is so good is because he is bearing his soul, opening his heart like never before with this album, his whole being went into this CD!<br /><br />Personally I hope Alice puts more of these types of albums out! 5/5 for sure!
1400043662|5.0|Kafka is a teenager who runs away from his single parent home. A simple premise, but the journey he takes is far from simple. He ends up holed up in a private library, then discovers he is not as alone as he thinks. A surreal trip out of day to day reality ends with Kafka coming to terms with himself and with the world. And don't forget the man who talks to cats and the Entrance Stone. <br /> <br />It's engaging, spellbinding and a delight to read. If you haven't read Murakami yet this is a great place to start - and then you're on a slippery slope to enjoying the rest of his works.
B0009TRRN0|3.0|Roger Corman is legendary for dubbing and editing foreign films together for the American market. His company, New World, outdid themselves on this one. Unleashed on unsuspecting stateside audiences in 1980, Shogun Assassin has gained a mythic stature of it's own. Backed with a killer soundtrack by ex-Raider Mark Lindsay, this puppy is the sort of grindhouse picture that simply doesn't exist anymore. Cobbled together from the first two Lone Wolf & Cub movies, \\"Assassin\\" is the story of a renegade samurai in ancient Japan, travelling with his son, cutting down the Shogun's ninja spies who murdered his wife. The Shogun's men hunt them at every turn. Extraordinarily graphic stuff. Check out the Master of Death who praises The Wolf's technique even as a bloody mist sprays from his slit throat! Decapitations, impalations, heads cut in half, you name it, it's here. But...there's one big problem, kemosabe. This print looks atrocious, squeezed into the middle third of the screen by artifical letterboxes. Definitely get the two disc version that should be arriving in a few weeks. GZA fans NEED to see this movie. \\"Liquid Swords\\" samples it continously.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|At first the album surprised me -- the tempo it sets is clearly a departure from Pearl Jam's past few albums. It is not the lazy ballads of Riot Act, nor the sometimes strange tales of Binaural. The album shows that Pearl Jam, despite a long absence from its roots, can reemerge with the same magic that brought us Ten. The songs have grown on me over time, although I would still say (as I'm sure may others would) that Pearl Jam's earliest works still rank highest in my perception. Still, this new, self-titled work is deserving of your hard-earned dollars.
0060594888|5.0|This book is awesome, and I think it's the best self improvement book I've read to date, and I've read quite a few.  It's a fairly thick book, so it's comprehensive and he breaks it down by principles, so it only takes a few pages to get through each.  Jack Canfield is like Brian Tracys twin brother; they give similar advice, write in a similar style, and they even look alike.  Most books I get rid of after reading once or I don't even finish it if it didn't hold my interest.  This is one of the few that is worth keeping and reading again.
B00005JOVH|4.0|The title of the movie pretty much sums it up. All I can say is this was a sad ending to a promising and intresting franchise. What was 20th Century Fox thinking? Many people are asking is this the last X-men movie and I have to say after seeing this film without a doubt it sadly is. My only guess to why 20th Century Fox ended this great franchise so suddenly is the common problem of the actors and actresses contract disputes. To sum it up great yet sad movie,cool special effects, and lots of great action.
0609610570|4.0|This book actually is a very good book on how to make things happen in a corporation.  This covers the ideas of Jack Welch at GE and some other companies such as EDS. It does explain the reason for success and sites the examples of failures (and why things work one place and not another).  I enjoyed the discussion of managers not having enough emotional fortitude to let people go.  I would say this is definitely a must have book for dealing with the corporate environment (and for a person managing and growing a company it also is a good read).
B0000013GT|5.0|This is an absolutely dope album. The formula is filled with this one. Lyrics, beats, hooks and subject matter. Dre is one of the illest emcees of current times when he is rapping instead of BS'ing around trying to be a singer. This my second favorite outkast album next to aquemini. After aquemini it is all down hill for outkast.
B000F3TBIO|3.0|One of those projects whose anticipation will likely lead to extraordinary dissapointment on the part of many fans, Peeping Tom is Mike Patton's take on pop music.  Admittedly, it seems highly unlikely we'll be hearing any of this stuff on the radio anytime soon, but the project has been cooking for the past six years-- Patton's desire to largely perform it on his own augmented by a consideration at pursuing a major label for its release (it ended up coming out on Patton's own Ipecac Records) and Patton's endless array of distractions (i.e. every other band he's involved in) resulted in this taking several years to complete, finally seeing release. <br /> <br />The concept on the record is pretty simple-- Patton by and large tackles most the instruments and vocals, with an array of guests either in a production role (Dan the Automator, Amon Tobin, Jel, Odd Nosdam, Massive Attack, the Dub Trio) or performing role (Kid Koala and DJ Disk on turntables, Dale Crover of the Melvins on drums, beat boxer Rahzel, Doseone and Norah Jones on vocals as well as instrumental contributions by all the producers) providing assistance, but this is clearly a Mike Patton record.  While it is more rhythmically founded in pop than anything Patton has done in quite a long time, the rather detailed arrangements and production result in a depth of instrumentation that keeps this from being a real pop record-- there's too much going on at any time, and Patton's proclivity to odd vocalizations does shine through here.  Net result-- it's significantly more commercial than Fantomas or Mr. Bungle, but this isn't exactly the Backstreet Boys... <br /> <br />So how is it?  All this anticipation and all?  All in all, it's pretty mixed-- there's a lot going on here, a lot of energy and a lot of different sounds and ideas, and I suspect it'll be one that'll reveal itself in different ways with further listening.  It betrays pretty readily a heavy industrial/alternative vibe to it-- lots of industrialguitars and distorted basses mixed in with the hip hop beats and the layered synths-- but in this vein, it succeeds only moderately, like much industrial music, the endless production gets in the way of the energy of the piece (\\"Celebrity Death Match\\") and ends up creating a number of somewhat unmemorable pieces (\\"How U Feelin?\\"). <br /> <br />On the other hand, when it's good, it can be fantastic-- leadoff single \\"Mojo\\" comes equipped with pulsing rhythms, a fine Middle Eastern vibe and a great explosive chorus (that, when presented live on Conan O'Brien, really cut loose), \\"Caipirinha\\" is almost beyond explanation-- breezy guitars offset with a strained vocal until the industrial energy catches the chorus, and for anyone who's been waiting for Patton to return to the sounds of Faith No More, \\"We're Not Alone\\" will probably make you happy-- it's as close as he's come to that vein in a long time.  Also of interest are a couple pieces where Patton's usual oddities come shining through-- the odd vocalizations of opener \\"Five Seconds\\" and the totally unexpected 1972 Miles meets Thrill Kill Kult of \\"Your Neighborhood Spaceman\\" come immediately to mind. <br /> <br />A couple things deserving note: the artwork-- it looks like a sort of slipcase, but you pull this piece out and the CD tray pops out the other side-- it's pretty goofy but I certainly enjoy some inventiveness with packaging.  Also, iTunes has an exclusive track as the \\"b-side\\" for the \\"Mojo\\" single that fans will want to seek out. <br /> <br />I'm not disappointed I bought it, but certainly there's a lot of Patton's other material that I enjoy a whole lot more than this-- some fans will give this glowing, five star OH MY GOD OF COURSE ITS GREAT IT'S PATTON reviews, but quite honestly, comparing this to his past couple albums, it's quite listenable but \\"General Patton vs. the X-ecutioners\\" and \\"Suspended Animation\\" set the bar awful high.
B00005JOVH|3.0|There are deaths. The first, early on, in a throw-away scene that was confusing and could have been cut from the movie without anyone noticing. The BIG death scene was so badly done it had none of the emotional impact it should have had.   Special effects were good, Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen were good, Halle Berry had demanded more screen time in this movie and did nothing with it. Ian McKellen was great, the best thing in the movie.   If Brian Singer had stayed with the film it could have been the best of the series. Instead it was a great disappointment.     Lastly, I'd like to lodge a complaint. My wife is handicapped and when a movie is over my prime concern is to get her back to the car. Obviously we missed this \\"extra scene\\". And each comment I read about how \\"cool\\" the scene was, it just pisses me off. Another reason for me to dislike Ratner.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|WoW. I usually dislike double sets because they run out of gas about 1/2 way through, but this is different. The RHCP have compiled a wonderful mix of old and new sounds that captivates the audience. I cannot get these songs out of my IPOD. This stands up to other classic 2 CD/LP sets like \\"London Calling\\" or Sign of the Times\\". Well done.
0440241588|2.0|The last 2 books I've read (this and The Last Juror) have been unrealisticly slow. This novel starts off with a bang, but then it seems like 300 pages of an Italian history book with a mix of a Romance novel. If you don't care to read hundreds of pages about Bologna, then take a pass on this novel. The ending is interesting, but very sub-par for a great author.
B000EOTTV8|5.0|Felicity Huffman (DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES) and Kevin Zegers have the leads in TRANSAMERICA, directed by Duncan Tucker. Ms. Huffman was nominated for an Oscar-- surely no actress gave a better performance in 2005 than she-- for her work in this film, which has to be one of the best of the year.<br /><br />Just before having the surgery that will finally change her from a man to a woman, Bree (Huffman) learns that she may be the father of a wayward seventeen-year-old hustler son-- who, by the way, still sleeps with a stuffed animal-- Toby played by Zegers. Posing as a religious do-gooder, Bree half-heartedly rescues Toby from a life of hustling; and the two embark on a road trip across America (trans America) with their ultimate destination being Los Angeles, where Bree will have her surgery. What transpires-- there's that \\"trans\\" word again-- is ultimately a beautiful love story between one pre-op transexual and her long lost son. Much of the movie will make you laugh; parts of it will practically make you cry as these two outsider characters find out things about each other and themselves that they have never dreamed of before. While much of the plot is predictable-- this is not a criticism-- there are a couple of twists that you probably will not expect.<br /><br />Although Huffman is perfect as a pre-op transexual, from her dress to her voice-- somewhere between a baritone and an alto-- to her mannerisms as she tries so hard to become she woman she wants to be, Zegers gives her a run for her money, vascillating from the tough punk hustler to the child who really desperately wants to be loved by a parent.<br /><br />The film also boasts a fine soundtrack, ending with a cut by Dolly Parton, certainly a performer who knows all about what is real and what isn't.<br /><br />TRANSAMERICA is what you expect from a European art film, not most of the films coming out of Hollywood. A fine, fine movie indeed.
1400079179|5.0|It's very hard to put this book down once you read it. I think the story line for first 3/4 of the book was amazing and suspenseful. But the last 1/4 was totally deflated and the ending was quite crappy. A good reflection on art, symbols, and the hidden meaning as well as christianity.
B000067CPX|2.0|OK, first of only By The Way,The Zephyr Song and Can't Stop, are the only real decent ones, I mean This Is The Please and Venice Queen good, but all the rest are dissapointing. <br />I picked up Stadium Arcadium the other day, and loved that, so this just seems so underdog compared to it.
044024157X|2.0|If you like the Grisham novels where it's non-stop action and suspense all the way through the novel, this book is NOT for you. It is not even close to his other jury titled book \\"The Runaway Jury.\\" This books is very slow and the real mystery only begins in the last 50 pages. Up to that point, it is very slow and actually boring. Quite a drop-off from Grisham's usually high standards in my opinion
0131479415|5.0|Mike Cohn is establishing himself as THE author to answer the most pressing questions facing the agile practioner.  He follows up his widely popular book on user stories by addressing the next most vexing challenge: planning and estimation.  While many were focused on advocating a specific agile method or vilifying them all, Mike focused on what was happening on real projects.  The result described in this book is an elegant blend that embodies the intent of all the agile gurus in a straight forward, pratical set of practices.<br /><br />Having taught and coached these practices for the last seven years, I have seen dozens of variations of planning and estimating required to meet the needs of different projects and teams.  This book is a great distillation reflecting the agile community's understanding to date of the most cost efficient way to handle the challenging task of estimating and planning.<br /><br />A book without blemishes is a book never published.  Part III on Planning for Value fails to get beyond concepts into practical application the way the other parts do so well.  This foreshadows future work(s) by Mike or others.  It is still, however, a valuable pointer to an important part of successful projects.<br /><br />If you are participating in an agile project and are at all vested in the predictability of the outcome, this book is a must read.  It clearly lays out the language of agile, clarifys some oft-confusing concepts, and guides the practioner to an effective approach to minimizing the risks associated with the uncertainty of predicting the future.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|Okay, I saw the movie on TV. Sadly, It failed (as I said in my AOD review) but that's because all the good stuff was cut out. Then I rented it the movie, and I loved the original uncut version. Truly amazing! A great sequel.<br /><br />STORY: Ash returns to the remote cabin with his girlfriend. The stay at the cabin turns into a nightmare. The next morning, He gets attacked by the unseen evil, and because of that, he unleashes Evil Ash. He tries to escape, but the bridge has been destroyed! Now, his hand goes all bad, which turns him into a one-handed zombie killer, and when people find him in the cabin, they dislike him at first. But when they learn what has happened to them, they must tam up with Ash.<br /><br />OPINION: Awesome sequel! More gore, more excitement, and I love the ending. Waves the atmosphere ready for Army Of Darkness.<br /><br />So go rent this sequel!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Flea said is you don't like Stadium Arcadium (SA for short) your not a Chili's fan, and I have to say Flea is 100% right. <br />I cannot understand how noone can not like this, every song has a charm in someway, some charms to longer to find than others, but yes you will found them. <br />The singles are apparently going to be,  <br />Storm In A Teacup, Snow ((Hey Oh)), Tell Me Baby, Desecration Smile, 21st Century, Stadium Arcadium,  Dani California. <br /> <br />We only know 5 of them at this present time, but all together there's meant to be 7 including Dani California which all ready released, so we look forward to 6 more. <br />I'd buy this album because nearly every song could be singles, ok \\"If\\" is quite boring, but thats the only song. <br />Buy this is you consider yourself a Red Hot Chili Pepper fan!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|A reviewer recently wrote that the two men are cheating on their wives, and viewers are tolerating that. What this reviewer forgot to answer, is why. <br /> <br />The reality is, these men were forced into marriage. The relationship was doomed to fail from the beginning, and if it was another time and place, they would never have got married, and would, instead, spend their life together as they should. <br /> <br />Viewers understand that, and that's why people loved these two characters, even after the tragedies they caused. The movie utilized true drama, and thoughts, protraying a love story that will last till the end of time.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I saw Kingdom of Heaven in the theater, and was somewhat let down.  It was a good movie, to be sure, but it felt like there was something missing, and it failed to move me.  Having just watched the Director's Cut, the missing elements were provided.  With the addition of only about 45 minutes of new footage, it becomes almost an entirely different motion picture.  What the new footage offers, and what the theatrical version lacked, was depth.  Depth of character.  It is now provided, not only for Balian, the lead, but also for Sibylla.  The pace is better and more appropriate to the scope of the story.  It is almost sad that the movie will never be as appreciated for a great movie since its better version was released only on DVD.
B000B8QF14|5.0|I bought this the day it was released and I have almost wore both the CD and DVD out. Billie Joe has an amazing live voice and they have so much energy when they play. It brought back wonderful memories of my first Green Day concert in 2005. Recommended for any Green Day fan.
0618001905|5.0|This book deals with the successful forced labor dictatorship set up by King Leopold II of Belgium in the Belgian Congo from 1885-1908.The death toll is generally estimated to approach 10 million .Leopold II benefited from a worldwide increase in the demand for rubber products.He decided to benefit from the steep increase in the price of rubber by enslaving the black male population of the Congo in much the same way that Ramses II enslaved the Hebrew Israelites to build his pyramids.His army took control of thousands of villages,held the women and children hostage,and forced the men to go into the rain forests to tap the wild growing rubber vines.The males were worked to death.The females and children starved to death.Those who fled died in the forests of starvation and disease.Those who resisted were killed in numerous military campaigns.The reading is depressing except for the individual journalists chronicled in the book who sought to expose what was going on,such as  E D Morel and S Lefranc.Leopold II easily ranks with Hitler,Stalin,and Mao for the title of the worlds greatest mass murderer.

B000003TA4|1.0|There is a reason for the lengthy string of bands being compared to Nirvana which have emerged over the years. The sound displayed on Nevermind is easily copied. The cliched sound was so offensive to me that I rejected it entirely upon its release.  <br /> <br />I am an individual who grew up listening to well recognized authentic musicians in rock music. I can easily seperate authentic music from bands who produce music designed to attract a mass audience. This is not to say that all music that attracts many followers is not genuine. Rather it's the composition of the crowd attracted to a certain style of music which helps define what it really is. Nirvana's Nevermind was suited for the tastes of fans who otherwise would have never ventured into this territory in the first place. It provided a bridge for many to traverse from popdom into the pseudo-hardrock world.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for authentic music in the hardrock/grunge genre from this era, look no further than Pearl Jam. The only albums worth appreciating from Nirvanas catalogue as true rock masterpieces would be In Utero.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I listened to AI. I loved American Idiot, Blvd of Broken Dreams & Holiday but as soon as I heard \\"I'm the son of rage and love, the Jesus of Suburbia\\" I was entranced.    Unlike many albums these days, there are no fillers. Every single song is wonderful, but I remember immediately loving Give Me Novacaine, Jesus of Suburbia, Extraordinary Girl & Letterbomb.    People should really give this album a chance instead of writing it off as a anti-American/anti-Bush album. 2 out of the 13 songs are political so that's just ridiculous.
B0002B15WE|5.0|i finally saw this with my dad last month and now it is my number 1 favorite movie of all time, the action in here was perfect not to much or to low. This also has the best movie villan rickman is humorus and the same time voilent. defenently the best die hard villan, to bad he ain't in very many movies like this.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|After fifteen years since the release of its landmark album Ten which, with the help of an Eddie Vedder, elicited on and off again success, Pearl Jam answers back with a self-titled release that is sure to please the majority of its fans, I being one of them.  With it, they are probably answering the majority of listeners who were disappointed with their previous release Riot Act, to all those that believe rock is dead, and to those who question whether or not Pearl Jam has the heart to make an honest, solid, rock and roll record.  Even though it doesn't capture the energy and magic that Ten-Vitalogy had, Pearl Jam's self-titled record is essentially a very solid record that leaves a pleasant after taste. <br /> <br />Now, to the music. <br /> <br />I remember the album Versus or  Vs. having a one-two punch starting with Go and ending with the intense Animal, from there the melodic and classic Daughter took over. Even in middle-age Pearl Jam, with its strongest line-up, gives its listeners not a one-two, but a one-two-three-four-five punch with some of the most aggressive songs starting an album.  Stating with the riff-rocker Life Wasted and ending with the energetic Maker in the Sand, which has a stellar chorus by the way.  Track number four might be the best in the bunch, Severed Hand due to its entrancing backward loop guitar effects and psychedelic-dizzy feeling.  From there it takes you into a hard rock journey, that you never anticipated going on.  Parachutes is literally a calming jump off a plane and feels like a song one might listen to while drifting and floating through the air.  Remember the name John Lennon when listening to Parachutes, please.  Unemployable might actually display the best sense of melody the band has used in years.  The records \\"cut\\" can be found at track number nine, a semi-acoustic/ballad titled Gone. This is an excellent example of why Pearl Jam is still around.  You can hear a hint of Pinball Wizard in the chorus.  Army Reserve might be a tip of the cap to U2.  Come Back is a tender bluesy-ballad about a plea to an old lover to....come back.  It displays Eddies best use of his voice as an instrument (for a previous example of this technique see: Black).  The final song is a massive Stairway to Heaven type closer.  Starting with quiet acoustics and muted keyboards and ending with McCready's tightest soloing ever.  The hint of euphoric keyboards at the very most tail end of the song might be a last fighting breath to whisper what changes might come in the band's next release. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, pick this record up.
B000003TA4|1.0|When I first heard this, I thought it was a joke. There was no way that anybody that sounded that constipated and played a musical instrument that bad could be taken seriously. Well, the joke wasnt just on me. It was on the whole music buying population who were brainwashed into thinking that this was something you could not do without.In fact,ever since this garbage was expelled onto the air there has been a decline in sales and radio listening.WHY?? People have started to finally wake to the realization that this band and countless followers do indeed SUCK!!! The only saving grace is that Kurt Nobrain killed himself and we will be saved from any future gasseous spewings from a no talent drug addict. Burn in hell Kurt. Burn in hell!!!!!!
B000F48CD8|4.0|Jack White has never been one to hide his influences.  That is no less evident on this first release from The Raconteurs.  For fans of Jack's various projects, you'll find no surprises here.  With that said, don't worry that this is simply another \\"Jack project\\".  There is definitely a \\"whole is greater than the sum of its parts\\" aspect at work. <br /> <br />There are some tracks here where Jack's influence isn't obvious, including \\"Steady, As She Goes\\".  Others, however, make it quite clear.  The styles and influences here range from Beatles-esque (\\"Hands\\") to Led Zeppelin (\\"Broken Boy Soldier\\") and beyond. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Jack and/or The White Stripes, by all means pick this up.  You probably already have.  Otherwise, anybody who is a fan of blues-oriented rock with a nod toward Led Zeppelin would certainly not be disappointed by this record. <br /> <br />Overall, this album presents itself more as a grab-bag of styles rather than a cohesive statement.  As debut albums go, though, The Raconteurs have a lot to be proud of.  I will definitely be looking forward to hearing more from this group.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is an incredible movie about a forbidden romance that truly captivate the souls of the watchers. <br /> <br />I watched this movie both in box office, and on DVD. My whole family enjoyed it, though my husband seems quite surprised to see that I am not offended by the men going behind the wives' backs. <br /> <br />The fact is, I despise men who cheat, but the circumstances are different. Ennis and Jack, in a way, are bonded as mates emotionally, and had the world have a more open point of view, they will not need to suffer, and neither will their wives. But they had to get married because for Ennis, his family demands it, and for Jack, people are excluding him for trying to establish homosexual relationships.  <br /> <br />I can see why people will be offended by these two cowboys, but quite frankly, I just cannot feel any anger for them. Perhaps it is how director Ang Lee played his emotion magic again on its audience, or that I can understand the circumstances. But either way, the fact remains that this movie is probably the best movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br />If there is any anger I feel about this movie, it will be the Academy's unjust ruling in awarding Crash the Best Picture of 2005. The movie have good intentions written all over it, but it is just a poorly directed, and filmed motion pictures. I do not see why Brokeback Mountain did not receive the Best Pictures of 2005, except that the Academy judges are homophobic.
B00006LIRI|4.0|From my estimation, there seems to be 5 kinds of U2 fans: <br />1. Those who think they went downhill after War <br />2. Those who think they went downhill after The Joshua Tree <br />3. Those who think they went downhill after Achtung Baby <br />4. Those who think they went downhill after Pop <br />5. Those who think U2 have been consistently good from beginning to present. <br /> <br />If you're apart of groups 1 & 2, don't get this record. <br /> <br />'90-'00 covers albums Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Pop, apart of All That You Can't Leave Behind, some soundtrack songs, and one new song. <br /> <br />Achtung Baby-all of the usual suspects are here except The Fly; but that song isn't really good anyway, so I'm glad they left it off. <br /> <br />Zooropa-Where's Lemon? Numb is remixed but the original is better. <br /> <br />Pop-All of its songs have been remixed and the remixes are actually better, but I listen to the originals as well. <br /> <br />All That You Can't Leave Behind-first 2 singles are represented, Beautiful Day and Stuck in a Moment...Personally, I think they're pushing it by putting these songs on this album. They should have all been saved for the 2000-2010 collection (that's if they make enough music to get a third collection.) <br /> <br />The song Miss Sarajevo is from another album called Passengers. <br /> <br />Hold Me...and Hands That Built America are songs from soundtracks. <br /> <br />Electrical Storm is a new song. <br /> <br />
B00006BTCA|1.0|I definitely regret buying this cd. <br />There are no good songs and there is nothing good about this album. Its very \\"cheaply\\" put together and totally sucks. <br /> <br />DON'T BUY IT! MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY!
B0002OERI0|2.0|Sometimes I wonder what Green Day would be singing about if   the political climate in America were different. <br /> <br />Who knows? They'd probably be singing about something stupid like dookie.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|The first and the most important thing to point out about See You on the Other Side is that I am very much pleased with this album, really. I hoped that Korn would make something good and inspired, and they delivered. The disc is much more interesting than their work since Issues, and emphasizes Korn's best qualities. I mean, Korn are not the best in the world, but they are very special and do they music they can do well, which is clear on See You on the Other Side. <br />This album should satisfy any fan with cool groovy heaviness of Hypocrites and Liar and pissed-off catchiness of Politics and For No One. Twisted Transistor is one of Korn's most melodic, just listen to its remixes; so is Getting Off. But the disc is also filled with with dark, moody soundscapes of more mellow, but dramatic and intense songs like Throw Me Away, Love Song, Open Up (when did Korn - or any other metal band - have three such good mid-tempos in a row and didn't lose momentum?) and Seen It All. Some will surely love the original outro in the form of Tearjerker. What makes the mellower songs special is besides the fact that they are extremely well produced and sonically rich also the thing that Jonathan Davis uses his voice in so many diffrent ranges besides growling that some people should be already tired of. At moments, he seems to sing in the darkly vicious vein of some of the vocals on Life is Peachy era, which I always thought is the style  best suited for Korn.  <br />The instruments also don't disappoint. If I am not tatalking about them separately, this is simply because they are more integral part of the mix and do not stand out on their own, which is I think good. Overall, I cannot complain at all about Korn's latest album, except maybe for the fact that some of the tracks drag too much (Souvenir, Getting Off). But with a disc an hour long, you have much more to listen to, and I am sure every song here will find its devotees. Approach this album with open mind, it is worth it.See You on the Other Side is one of the few works in alternative metal in recent years worth listening to.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is more then just a man's last words.  It's an inspirational story about a man's views on life or a story of his own life.  It almost has two stories in it, a man fighting a very deadly disease or a professor of social psychology and how he breaks down the parts of a life.     This book happened by accident actually.  Mitch Albom (author) was watching TV and saw his old professor from college on ABC's nightline being interviewed about what its like to be dying from ALS, commonly known as Lou Gherig's disease.  Mitch soon got in touch with his old professor and it turned in to the biggest project of his life.     Morrie and Mitch started meeting every Tuesday and talked about different parts of life.  Examples would be family, marriage, regrets, and aging to name a few.  Each Tuesday has a different subject or topic.  The book also gives insights on the different stages of this deadly disease and explains with detail how it takes over your life.      Since reading this book, I have a different look at life.  I approach life with less fear and spend more time with the people I love most.  According to Morrie, life only comes around once.       I strongly suggest reading this thrilling book.  You will be taught some of life's greatest lessons and be able to view life in a totally different, stress free way.  The reason I liked it so much was because it opened my eyes to so many things I don't even think about.  Hopefully Morrie's class will be just as successful with you as it was for me.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Actually, the mix of classic hard rock and grunge Audioslave seem to play is not my cup of tea, but I have to admit I liked Out of Exile which is a very good, complete and well+crafted album. <br />The first disc from Audioslave sounded good technically, but also pretty boring, some brilliant and inspired moments (Cochise, Like a Stone, Show Me How to Live) aside. This one, however, is much more cohesive, energetic and expressive. THe songs stick together and unlike in the debut, it is clear that the vocals and the instruments are coming from the same source of inspiration. <br />Cornell sounds tired but not defeated on this album, and still ready to rock. It is a good thing to be able to both enjoy your aggression (Man or Animal, Drown Me Slowly) and be pleased with life in its deeper meaning (The Curse, Be Yourself). Overall, the album has an optimistic, sunnier feel to it - just listen to Dandelion, one of the highlights. Actually, all of the songs are pretty strong, Out of Exile is a well-balanced album. <br />The instruments shine throughout, form the bass on Drown Me Slowly and Man or Animal to the drums on the title track and guitar on Your Time Has Come and Yesterday to Tomorrow. Sometimes the instruments take too big part in the mix and occasionally there is a lack of motion, but these are minor flaws. <br />Out of Exile is essencially men's music, for people not dreaming about excesses but self-assured in a way that they know they can do the things they are able to and this is enough (and this is a positive message!), the men who are passionate but not whiny. I advise this album to anyone who looks for good classic rock/metal in recent releases, and am really looking forward to the band's next album.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I will bow down to the almighty opinion of Pearl Jam's lion, eventhough the Pixies are a pathetic attempt at music, Radiohead does not even begin to approach the genius of Pink Floyd, and Nirvana were the last true authentic voices in rock music. This album however does manage to erase the garbage legacy of Ten with a long-awaited raw performance from the band.
B000F8O35U|5.0|i think almost every girl born in the 1980s loved this film. I was obsessed with it and had all the movie stuff that came out after the movie: watch, the book, clothes, etc. i'm so happy that disney is finally releasing it on a special ed. dvd! i watched the original dvd version, but it just had the movie on it. i read on disney.com that the 2 disc edition was originally supposed to be released in 2008, but i'm so glad that they pushed it up to this year.
B0000027RL|2.0|There is a reason for the lengthy string of bands being compared to Pearl Jam which have emerged over the years. The sound displayed on Ten is easily copied. The cliched sound was so offensive to me that I rejected it entirely upon its release.  <br /> <br />I am an individual who grew up listening to well recognized authentic musicians in rock music. I can easily seperate authentic music from bands who produce music designed to attract a mass audience. This is not to say that all music that attracts many followers is not genuine. Rather it's the composition of the crowd attracted to a certain style of music which helps define what it really is. Pearl Jam's Ten was suited for the tastes of fans who otherwise would have never ventured into this territory in the first place. It provided a bridge for many to traverse from popdom into the pseudo-hardrock world. <br /> <br />If your looking for authentic music in the hardrock/grunge genre from this era, look no further than Nirvana. The only albums worth appreciating from Pearl Jam's catalogue as true rock masterpieces would be Vitalogy or the new self-titled effort.
B0007P3582|3.0|First off, I don't pay attension to the politics and beefs of rappers, but this CD is not at all good.  His Get Rich or Die Tryin' record was what I would call a \\"classic\\" rap album while The Massacre just a flop.  His lyrics are choppy, the beat aren't great (even with Dr. Dre's help), Eminem's proformance sucked on \\"Gatman and Robbin\\", and the rest of G-Unit didn't do much.  The few good ones are; This Is 50, Outta Control (not the REMIX with Mobb Deep who suck), Gunz Come Out, and the Hate It Or Love It REMIX.  My advice, just download these songs from somewhere, $16.00 is not worth it!
B000008LH5|2.0|THEY DID IT AGAIN - TAKING A MASTERPIECE AND BECAUSE OF GREED CHOPPING UP AND EDITING AWAY AN ENTIRE MELODY AND CUTTING DOWN \\"I CAN'T KEEP FROM CRYING SOMETIME\\" TO A LITTLE OVER THREE MINUTES.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|I will not be buying this. I want the original trilogy re-mastered for DVD in anamorphic widescreen, not some lame laser-disc transfer I can get from elsewhere. This is a cheap shot, IMO, on the part of Lucasfilm and not what the fans want.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The Kingdom of Heaven 4 disc director's cut is presented in \\"roadshow\\" format.  This means it has an introduction by director Ridley Scott, and overture, and an intermission.  Similar films shown in this type cut are: Spartacus, Gone with the Wind, and My Fair Lady.    Kingdom of Heaven takes place between the second and third crusade, in a time known as, \\"The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.\\"  In listening to the commentaries that stretch over two discs you learn that the cast and crew did extensive research on the period.    Ridley Scott based the look of the film upon the paintings of Orientalist Dave Roberts, and Jean Leon Gerome.    Disc 1 and 2 contain the feature film, three commentaries, and a closed captioned trivia track.    Disc 3 and 4 contain a feature-length documentary, and various featurette's about the making of the film.    Primarily what the director's cut does is add back characterization, and story which the studio requested be taken out of the movie because of length the theatrical cut, which I also have runs, two hours, 25 minutes, the director's cut run-time is three hours, 19 minutes.    The director's cut adds back the story of Sybilla's son, Baldwin V, and the story of his succession to the throne.  It also adds more about Balin's family dynamic, his wife, and his brother.    It also adds the fact that Balin is not a blacksmith.  But an engineer, who has had some experience at building siege towers.  So, the movie makes more sense.    I liked the theatrical cut, but I like the movie better in this form, and I agree with the director that it would have been better received if it had been released in this form.  The studios should have marketed the picture as a prestige piece such as, \\"Gone with the Wind.\\"

0385512058|4.0|Not too long ago, I met two grown men in vastly different positions in their work field. One was a PR manager for a Fortune 500 company; the other was a professor at a high school. The former graduated from Maryland with a Bachelor degree in Communications, the other- high school professor- had an MBA from American University in Business Management. The obvious question that echoes in your head, as it did in mine, is why did the guy with an MBA find himself with a much less profitable job. The answer to this question lay in his answer to the question I asked the day I met him which was \\"do you have any connections in American that may help me get into their MBA program?\\" As you are probably guessing, his answer was no. He went through his entire two years at AU without making any significant contacts and this coyness resulted in the second-rate fate of his career. The former Maryland graduate, however, was a networking mogul. He kept a palm pilot filled with the names and numbers of old friends and acquaintances. This is the essence of this book. It speaks of the importance of networking as well as, and most importantly, how to do it well. If networking is an art then Ferrazzi is a Grand Artiste.
B000002UDB|5.0|Though most folks consider the trilogy of \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\" to be the Fab Four's finest work, I would substitute \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" for \\"Rubber Soul\\" in this holy trilogy. \\"Tour\\" has been cited as an uneven album compared to \\"Soul\\" but I think it's the other way around. Don't get me wrong-\\"Rubber Soul\\" is a terrific album, the one that showed the Beatles starting to experiment with their sound but for sheer brilliance and total innovation one can't beat songs like the best three found on this disc. Simply put, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"I Am The Walrus\\" changed the face of pop music forever. Nothing before these gems were released ever sounded anything like the worlds these songs took us to. They truly inhabited their own space. Yes, there are a few weak tunes on this disc. I've always thought \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" and \\"Flying\\" were a bit lame but two songs out of eleven is not a bad ratio. I also particularly love George's colorfully weird \\"Blue Jay Way\\", Paul's lovely \\"Fool on the Hill\\" and nonsensical (in a good way) \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and John's cryptic ode to materialism, \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\". Rounding things out is THE ultimate anthem of the Summer of Love, John's \\"All You Need Is Love\\". This album may be more a collection of songs as opposed to a unified studio effort but what a collection! This is one of the Beatles' essential albums- acquire it and be amazed.
B00000F1D3|5.0|When listening to an album with such obvious pop appeal, it is easy to overlook what a truly gifted singer Cher really is.    While not possessing a large range, Cher has the ability to characterize every word. Her low range is fun to satirize, but for us Cher fanatics, that's the best part!    These songs wouldn't amount to much sung by anyone else  - but with Cher as the vocalist they are great. The first six songs are non-stop hits - the best being The Power. All are very well and imaginatively mixed with a lot of subtle touches if you are listening closely.    The final songs, beginning with Taking Back My Heart may be less obvious hits, but they really grow on you, and  they are perhaps the strongest cuts on the entire CD. Taxi, Taxi, in particular has a mesmerizing quality to it. Love is the Groove is the one song I am not too excited about.    The final song is a remix of We All Sleep Alone, and it is a good one.    When you are as successful as Cher you are going to have plenty of detractors. It is difficult, however, to find any honest negative reviews that are basically not hateful.     Cher can take it all to  the Bank - a truly great talent - a singer, actor and stage performer.    Like they say, it ain't Shakespeare, but I would rather top level pop than so so of anything else.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you haven't watched the entire firefly series, I recommend watching it first.  Although this movie could stand on it's own and be rated high with the top science fiction movies, I personally think you will get more out of it if you know a little more about each character and their personalities.  (By the way, I'm SO disappointed that this series went off the air and would LOVE for it to be resurrected)
0099450259|2.0|I am disappointed about the book \\"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\". When I read the cover of the book and saw the list of the prizes it won, I thought it is a really good written and thrilling book! <br />The story about the autistic boy is good but from time to time the book is written boring and some chapters tell stories, which have nothing to do with the real story. <br />All in all I am not exhausted from the book, even if the story is great.
B00005JOVH|4.0|Now I see what all the negativity was about. If you do not relate to the term \\"fanboy\\" or you have never found yourself foaming at the mouth over changes made to a series you originally loved, then you do not know how furious it must have made Marvel Comics fans when they went to see X-men: The Last Stand.<br /><br />Now, for about a couple dozen minutes, it's all good; We all know Jean Grey (Famke Jensen) met her end in the last film, X2: X-men United. We all also know that Jean Grey returns; at least you have to know because she has a big role in the film. What happens after that 24 minutes or so is a warping and twisting of the X-men canon that most fans of the Marvel Comics series would retch at the sight of. It's not to say that these major plot points will anger people who have never picked up an X-men title. The Last Stand is a solid film on its own, but it really shreds and fiddles with what we X-fans all knwo about our favorite mutants.<br /><br />The film begins two decades before the present time, when Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart, who has always been perfect for this role) and Erick Leshnner (Ian Mckellan, who is just great with every line he says), The future Magneto, go to recruit a young Jean Grey for Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. This is an important moment in the history of the X-men because Jean Grey's mutant ability is telepathy and her power has a potential that Xavier saw and wanted to help mold. While a Young Jean grey saw the benefit to her mutation, a young Warren Worthington III (10 years later) does not find his angelic wings to be a blessing, but a curse.<br /><br />This sets the scene for the 2 major plot points, the return of Jean Grey and the discovery of a \\"cure\\" for all mutankind. Word of this cure first reaches the hands of a mutant named Beast (Kelsey Grammer, another great casting choice) who is a member of the government's mutant affairs division. Beast is friends with Xavier, so he gives him warning about this cure. While Xavier does oppose this new creation by Worthington Labs, he is not willing to take matters into his own hands through violence. His old comrade Magneto, on the other hand, is more than willing to kill anyone, mutant or human, who gets in the way of he and the newly expanded Brotherhood from destroying this \\"cure.\\"<br /><br />This is where things get hinky for people who know and love the X-men series. Without giving out any spoilers, all I can say is that things happen that aren't supposed to according to X-men history. There are also certain people who show up where they don't exactly belong and finally, the Juggernaut's (Vinnie Jones, another bit of good casting) history is totally turned on its head. This is the only bit of info I can expose without spoiling it for any potential viewers.<br /><br />In X-men: The Last Stand, the Juggernaut is now a mutant (he was a man imbued with magical power in the comics) he doesn't seem to have a relation to Professor Xavier (he is related to Xavier in the comics) and he has, well, Vinne Jones' accent (he doesn't have a british accent, as far as the comics go). I think that fans will overlook these details because they will be too busy pulling out their hair at what happens at every step of this film.<br /><br />I would like to expose myself as an X-Heretic because I do not think that these monumental changes in the X-men story make the movie bad. I have already read the X-men story. I already know the story behind the Pheonix saga. What's wrong with giving fans a story where they will not be able to tell what's going to happen next? Every X-men film has not followed the X-men books to the letter, but the problem for X-fans here is that the screenwriters have gone off the deep end into a totally different direction that just will not sit well with people who know and love nearly every mutant who appears in this mutantfest. Hey, at least a lot of the mutants we fans have always wanted to see on the big screen are represented (except for Gambit, damn you) and get to toe-to-toe with each other.<br /><br />Now, for you non X-fans. It's alright. Please take my word for it. X-men: The Last Stand is a solid sc-fi action comic book movie with stunning special effects, good performances from everyone involved and strong fight choreography. The total disregard for X-men history should not bother you, because you don't know much about the source material. X-men The Last Stand is a worthwhile night at the movies. If you find any fault with this film, I believe the writers are to blame, not X-men movie virgin Brett Ratner, who took  a lot of [...] for helming this.<br /><br />Oh, before I go, be sure to stay after the credits roll for a special bonus scene!to toe-to-toe with each other.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|My best friend lend me this movie yesterday. Since last night was movie time for my boyfriend and I, and neither of us have went to the video store to rent a movie we want to watch, we decided to watch this one. After all, 8 Academy awards got to count for something.  <br /> <br />By the end of this movie, I was in tears. A friend of my best friend is gay, and somehow, I immediately identify Jack as this friend. Not only is this movie beautifully written, and filmed, the emotions it rises in me is unlike anything I have ever felt. Watch this movie with an open mind, you won't be disappointed.
B000FGGE68|1.0|I have never seen such a missuse of great sci fi effects.  The stunts are crazy, the graphics oustanding, but the story is so lame, the action to predictable.  She kills her enemies way to easy, there's no one to challenge her it does not make it interesting.  Now why Milla wasn't chosen for BloodRayne? perharps the movie would have done great, after all Rayne is modeled after her, I think this movie is trying to show us that Milla can be a Bad ass vampire warrior, but somehow it reminds me of Aeon Flux gone bad.  I am sorry but this movie is highly rental material is you want to have some good laugh, it can not be taken seriosly, don't get me wrong I love Milla as an action star but this was a major flop.
0385504209|3.0|There has been a gargantuan amount of attention, energy, and money dedicated to debunking this novel...<br /><br />Now before you go on, think about that statement; a novel is a work of fiction and \\"debunking\\" means disproving, so debunking fiction would create fact, correct? Unfortunately the Catholic Church didn't think about that when they began their wild-eyed, hysterical rantings about this novel and, as a result, have given this average thriller an enormous sales boost by making it seem like they (the Church) have something to hide... And made it where I can't turn on any of the discovery channels without hearing about all the falsehoods found in a fictional book...<br /><br />Anyway;<br /><br />The DaVinci Code is the fourth book from Dan Brown (the second to feature lead character Robert Langdon) and the novel plays out kind of like a scavenger hunt that involves the reader and encourages them to solve the next puzzle. Not poorly written or simplistic but it is written for mass market, cross-genre' appeal, and I do believe he had a movie in mind when he wrote it.<br /><br /> It never quite reaches the level of full-blown thriller (more like thriller-lite), some of the plot twists are predictable, and some of the characters are a bit thin but The DaVinci Code isn't a bad read if you just want some entertainment. If you are looking for deep insights into human nature, answers to moral and philosophical question, or works of historical significance then you should look elsewhere. If you want some quick escapism that has some interesting puzzles then try The DaVinci Code.

B000FC2FVA|4.0|If youre looking for a similar sound to Alphabetical, this is not it.  \\"Its never Been Like That\\" is a mix of the less notable tracks from \\"United\\" and some funk and soul from \\"Alphabetical\\".  Like I said  before, you'll be disappointed if youre looking for the same sound as Alphabetical, but dont be turned off.  The Cd is actually really great, but it will take a few listens to really like it.  I think \\"Consolation Prizes\\" , \\"Courtesy Laughs\\", and \\"Napolean Says\\" are the best track while \\"Lost and Found\\" and \\"North\\" arent the best.  All the other tracks are good and will still take a few more listens for me to cozy up to. I think a good band is one that keeps reinventing themselves and is contstantly changing and Phoneix does that well.

0307276902|4.0|A Million Little Pieces was a good book but mainly all of it was made up. But it also shows if you start doing drugs and drinking you will get addicted and wont be able to quit. Then it's going to effect you alot plus your family and friend's. I think that if someone who is doing drug's and drinking or just one of them read this book it might change their opinion. Then maybe they will be able to quit before it's to late. Were it's gonna be really hard for them to quit. There is truth in this though...not necessarily about him but what can happen to people. <br />In part of the book one of his friend's goes out with one of her other friend's and he was drunk under age thought he could be the train and they got hit she died he didn't. So that's true to cause teen's think nothing's going to happen to them if they do this... but it's going to so this show's you just shouldn't cause this stuff does happen. <br />So this book is partically true to what happen's but then again it was exaggerated and wasn't true about him but it was a good book.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|This hilarious romp in the gridiron is entertaining and memorable.  If you haven't seen it, don't miss it.<br /><br />Several of the reviewers rated it low in comparison to the original.  It doesn't need to be compared.  It can stand on its own.  However, if one must compare it, I liked it nearly as much as the 1974 version.  It is updated for a new generation.  Burt Reynolds even acts, which is another bonus.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Unlike what the two recent reviewers say about Brokeback Mountain, society still has a lot of pressure on how a person should live, and behave.  <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain is a wakeup call for people to see what the world truly is. Gay bashing has always existed, and still exists. Even today, even when someone is killed, as long as the person is homosexual, the media and police will turn a blind eye against the case (as in the case of Rashawn Brazell, New York) <br /> <br />Consider this movie as a cry for our desire of a better world. If society really will happily accept these two characters as couples, why do they need to go behind their wives' backs? Remember, the only relationships where cheating occurs is unsatisfied ones that should be broken off anyways.

B00005JOVH|3.0|i'm with most of the guys.  it's just ok not that great.   it didn't achieve that \\"grand\\" level it's supposed to or tried to; even the final scene.  what's more despite what most think of the action sequences, i don't quiet marvel them.   all these actions in \\"the last-stand\\" combined, wouldn't beat the opening scene of X2.  most importantly, at least me, why not try to use the cure mutant in some way to beat phoenix.  i know the adult mutants tried to protect the little kid and logically phoenix was too powerful, but at least they could work a scene or two whereby the cure mutant would like to help even if he wouldn't have been allowed anyway by the adults. (hope rogue were there too to suck phoenix's pwoer and use it back on her).  it's i think logically what most of us would think as fans.   some loopholes, took too many easy way-outs.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching this film!!! Prior to watching \\"Capote\\" the only thing I really knew about Truman Capote was that he wrote \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\"!  <br /> <br />So, this film was truly enlightening.... like the fact that he was lifelong friends with author Harper Lee (To Kill A Mockingbird) and they'd met as children. Thought it was really intersting to see how Capote came about writing his novel \\"In Cold Blood\\" and all the research that went into it. The movie real had me wondering as to the sincerity of Capote's friendship with Perry Smith. The movie portrays Capote as only using Perry Smith as a pawn to write his novel and only befriends Perry Smith for this purpose along. <br /> <br />Thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman did an excellent job at portraying Capote and now see why he won the Academy Award for Best Actor!! Philip Seymour Hoffman not only looked very silimiar to Capote, but more impressive sounded just like him! <br /> <br />I thought it wise that the screenwriters should focus the movie on one aspect of Capote's life, rather than try to focus the movie on his entire life. How can one really do a good job of focusing on one individuals life in two hours? <br /> <br />Thought the movie was visually stunning, had striking costumes, wonderful cinematography, interesting screenplay, and dynamic performances by the cast members..... Highly recommend watching this film!
0375831002|5.0|As an avid lifelong reader of books, including work usually referred to as \\"youth fiction\\", all I can do is encourage all mature readers to try this book. Its narration by Death is one of its unique points, but rest assured this is not just some writer's gimmick. Its harsh power is so gripping I actually wonder at its recommendation for teens- they'd have to be pretty mature to take some of the depictions in this tale. I would highly recommend the book as a fictional counterpoint to Anne Frank's diary for mature teens reading about WWII and the Holocaust, driving home the idea that brave hearts and strong consciences were found even in Nazi Germany. The character of Liesel jumps off the page with the same life and vivacity as Anne. While there can be no direct comparison between a real person and fictional character, both  books convey the horrors of WWII through the eyes of the young. The Book Thief can also serve as a reminder as to how easily society can push us to overlook individual conscience for personal and financial comfort. The character of Liesel will live long in my memory as few characters have. This book is a real gem.
0780622553|3.0|This film noir suspenser is an OK way to spend an evening but won't be filed in many people's list of great detective films. The story involves a guy whose memory seems a-twitter who is obviously the pawn of aliens. Sounds goofy? It is.<br /><br />There is some stylish production values in the oddball city where it is always night and rainy, and there are many famous actors in the starry cast.<br /><br />However, I liked Charlton Heston's first film, \\"Dark City\\", from 1950 much more than this one. I doubt the two were related in any significant way other than having the same title since Heston's movie, his first starring role, was about the underworld, as I recall.<br /><br />In any event, this movie is an OK night with the DVD player.

Listen twice and you'll be impassioned. Listen again and again and you will become addicted. Like magic. I dare you to stop listening. Oh, you may for awhile. But you'll always come back. <br /> <br />Take \\"Life\\" on a road trip. Take \\"Life\\" to the ocean. Take \\"Life\\" to the mountains.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie leaves the viewers with a lot of what-ifs to answer: the most important being, what if Jack and Ennis spend their whole life together. <br /> <br />The truth is, if that were the case, they would probably, as Ennis suggested, get killed. This is signified at the end of this movie, when Jack tries to move on by starting another relationship with another man. It is unfortunate that this movie is so realistic, making Brokeback Mountain a Broke-Heart Mountain.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|When one of my daughters announced this was the best movie she had seen in awhile, and that I needed to see it, i reluctantly agreed to join in and watch.  Some of the scenes had a cheese factor that I could not help laughing out loud at, but was stunned to see my wife and daughters not laughing at all...and intrigued to see my response.  We pressed on.<br /><br />I think the story line of the movie is somewhat predictable...at least I guessed the ending shortly into the movie and was hushed quickly by one of the kids who had seen it.<br /><br />Still, there were many great family scenes that depict problems lots of families have including misunderstanding motives of close family members and what children really want from their family.  I found one scene after another quite entertaining (and that's really the idea in movies isn't it?).<br /><br />By the time we were done, I felt our family was closer to one another and a good mood and tone was set for our Memorial Day Holiday Week-end.<br /><br />Without giving away the plot, I would like to just say that this movie is above average as far as movies go.  I think that most Dads need to watch this movie with an open mind.  We all can learn something from it.  Guys raising early teens probably need to watch this more than most people.  It seems to connect with pre and early girl teens the most.<br /><br />I will probably watch it again sometime in the next year with my whole family.  I recommend this movie as an above average family oriented flick.  Enjoy it!
B000EULJLU|1.0|This is by far Tool's most dull and pretentious album yet.  That's right, pretentious, coming from a band with a mediocre bassist and guitarist, with lyrics that may or may not be total bulls**t.  I actually have listened to this album, and the concept is so cryptic, I don't think it's possible for it to be valid, yet you Tools who worship this band call it \\"deep\\".  Want to hear deep?  Pick up Dark Side of the Moon, not this overhyped pretentious wankfest.  Stop being a bunch of Tools (intentional).
0618477942|5.0|Wow.  I've been trying to figure out how to start this review, but every opening sounds like it's belittling: \\"Proving that she can do more than her comic strip ...\\" or \\"Moving beyond her \\"Dykes\\"...\\" does a great disservice to Bechdel and the comic strip world she has been superbly chronicling for the past twenty-odd years.  Bechdel isn't moving beyond anything here; she's just done something different.<br /><br />It shouldn't come as any surprise that Bechdel is capable of producing such a great work -- she has proved time and again in both her comic strip and other media (her hilarious and much missed wall calendars from the 90s) that she can blend words, drama and humor as sharply as any.  The surprise to me here is just how deeply Bechdel allows us to glimpse into her life.<br /><br />\\"Fun Home\\" is no easy narrative: the story of Bechdel's family and especially her difficult father bends, buckles and then turns to reveal more truth as each chapter goes by.  The art and detail are so well done that I didn't feel as though I was looking at pen and ink drawings but real photos reminiscent of Italian \\"fumetti\\" comics.  When the book ended, I felt the need to go over it again and put the pieces together like a puzzle.<br /><br />I first discovered Bechdel when I was a junior in college 15 years ago and I've been following her work ever since.  Part of me wants to selfishly keep her as one of my own, somebody that I discovered before the mainstream and after I died, friends and family would find her books among my collection and think, \\"This is brilliant, if only we'd read her years ago!\\"<br /><br />I'll probably spend the next few months saying, \\"You liked 'Fun Home'? Amateur! *I've* been reading Bechdel since 1991.\\" But this book (and Bechdel's work in general) deserves a wide audience and all the success it gets.<br /><br />Bravo Alison, bravo.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|21st Century Film Industry probably witnessed a movie that has so much contraversy, and still survived in the minds of the critics. <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain reveals a side of America that is not so tolerant, despite our values over basic human rights. Still, this movie moved every one of its viewers, and taught all of us to become more accepting. This movie also taught us to cherish true love, which can be seen even between these two cowboys.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|I love the 1976 version which really had incredible effects especially in Kong's facial emotions and perfected the relationship between Kong and the woman.    I was not expecting to love this but I was expecting it to be alright and maybe even pretty good.  But this movie was absolutely torture to sit through.      First off, it's a CGI fest. Of course I knew that going in but I had a false hope that perhaps they would show restraint and use CGI skillfully.  I haven't paid attention but I hope this did not win any special effects awards.  The effects of this movie and those of its type are not artistry or cinematic skill, it's all a matter of computer technology being powerful enough to process and render it all.    This has all the undesirable aspects associated with CGI.  It has the overly elaborate absurd action sequences.  People run under a stampede of dinosaurs always finding the right spot to avoid being trampled and a guy karate kicks a dinosaur as he jumps from the foot of a larger dinosaur.   We have outrageous falls and always something available and utilized to break the action and he used as a swing to further combative action.  Ordinary people are utilizing everything in the environment to do amazing feats.      We also have the ridiculous shifting camera angles that seem so unnatural because they can not represent anyone's point of view.    This movie is backed by a bland musical score.  The acting is equally bland and doesn't cause any identification to the characters.  To me this movie hinges on the identification of the relationship between Kong and the woman which was created so beautifully in the 1976 version.    In this one, Kong is whipping the woman around violently.  So much so that her neck would have to be broken.  Kong also starts out displaying threatening intimidation and intimidating bullying of the woman.   The mood becomes like a kid's movie as the woman wins Kong over by juggling and dancing for his entertainment.    I was also annoyed by the movie switching to horror mode with the natives being presented as witch type characters.      The bulk of the movie is spent in CGI Jurassic Park mode with constant CGI dinosaur attacks and Kong/Dinosaur battles.  We also have multitudes of large CGI creatures attacking the other group of adventurers.    As I should have expected but had hoped against, the CGI goes beyond over the top when giant insects are swarming on a guys head and body as he jumps around erratically.  His buddy then gets a machine gun and blasts off the insect attackers that are grasping him.    This really had nothing at common with the groundbreaking film from 1932 besides ending as expected.   Despite recreating nothing worthwhile from the 1932 classic, it did decide to bring back the worst aspect which was the corny ending remark.  \\"It was beauty that killed the beast\\".    It is so frustrating to constantly see such uninspired garbage being rated 4 out of 5 stars here on Amazon and making so much money.  It is quite scary to realize that the average mentality  of society is so low.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Before the modern-era of Disney animation began with THE LITTLE MERMAID, the best animated Disney movies were the more original ones that they basically came up with themselves, e.g. BAMBI or THE FOX AND THE HOUND.  DUMBO is another one of those.  The movie is basically a story about believing in yourself and accepting the things in your life that make you different from others.<br /><br />The story is quite simple. A circus elephant, Mrs. Jumbo longs for a baby.  The stork comes a little late, but delivers her bundle of joy. She names the boy elephant Jumbo Junior, but as soon as the other elephants see his humungous ears they christen him Dumbo and the name sticks.  Dumbo's ears cause all sorts of problems.  Mrs. Jumbo is imprisoned after defending Dumbo from some teasing, reckless youths and Dumbo is made into a clown after he causes the big top to literally come down. Dumbo is one sad baby elephant, but then he meets Timothy Mouse and Timothy quickly becomes Dumbo's aid, confidant, and mentor. In the end, everything turns out okay.<br /><br />There's quite a bit that's appealing about DUMBO. To begin with, the movie (at around 63 minutes) is one of the shortest feature films ever released.  The story says all it needs to say and there really isn't any fluff (even the pink elephants have their place).  The animation is quite spectacular, especially considering that the film was released in 1941. The music and songs are top notch, with everything from catchy tunes to tear-jerking lullabies. The movie has a great message and it appeals to both children and adults. It truly is a Disney classic (and I don't use that term lightly).<br /><br />This edition of the film includes more extras that the length of the film.  There are a couple of games, some sing-along-songs, a \\"music video\\", and a featurette. My favorite part of the extras were the two Silly Symphonies that are included, \\"Elmer Elephant\\" and \\"The Mouse That Could Fly\\". Both go along with the theme of DUMBO and compliment the film nicely (and the Mouse short includes an appearance by the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio).UMBO and compliment the film nicely (and the Mouse short includes an appearance by the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio).
B0001L3LUE|5.0|\\"The Fog of War\\" is part Cold War documentary, part autobiography of US Secretary of Defence Robert S. McNamara (1961-1968). The latter aspect of the film gives McNamara the opportunity to vindicate his controversial role in America's involvement in Vietnam. He discusses the personalities and positions of US Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, General Curtis Le May, Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, etc. Film-maker Errol Morris, however, does not let him off so lightly on certain points, particularly the thorny issue of America's involvement in Vietnam.<br /><br />More importantly, it is a film outlining 11 positions every leader, politician or government should consider before he (it) enters a war. It never draws direct parallels to America's subsequent or current affairs. It follows events strictly relating to McNamara's service in the military during WWII and tenure as Secretary of Defence. Nevertheless, it is obvious these 11 positions are guidelines intended for policy-makers in power, regardless of political party or persuasion.<br /><br />To a certain extent, \\"The Fog of War\\" evokes sympathy for a now repentant McNamara despite the calculative role he once played in Vietnam. One realises the actions he and others took were not simple black and white decisions; they were complex and had ramifications just as controversial as the ones ultimately made. Former President Johnson actually comes off looking like the villain and the one who should be berated for America's war in Vietnam.<br /><br />If you lived during this period, \\"The Fog of War\\" will touch you personally. It did me. I was particularly stunned to hear the audio tape where President Johnson (1963-1968) criticises the Kennedy-McNamara position to extricate the US from further involvement in Vietnam.<br /><br />For students of history and political science, this film is a must see. Politicians, American or otherwise, should watch and LEARN from the lessons drawn during this period. They are still terribly relevant.

This is Bruce Springsteen at his best. A man who has grown like a musician and can write amazing songs such as, for instance: \\"Secret garden\\", which is one of the best, incredible.

B000EULJLU|5.0|The amount of reviews or this album proves that Tool has definitely left their mark on the music world and became millionaires, and for good reason.  It's funny to see all the negative one's for such an album from a band that doesn't give a [...] what you think.  You bought the album, that's all that matters. Why not put an album out once every 5 years?  If you think Tool is capable of more, you will no doubt be in line (or online) buying the next album in 2111 and they will live an incredible life in the meantime.  Lyrics in 10,000 days focus on all of us idiots in this country with one hell of a soundtrack.  The CD age is dying, and a band that focuses on a journey from start to finish instead of two or three tracks you can download the mp3 of will be sorely missed in a few years.  This ALBUM is incredible and if you can keep your focus for an hour to hear it, you won't be able to wait to do it again.  People here can do song by song reviews all day long, but that isn't the point of a release like this.  Take it for what it is and you will appreciate what a five year wait has given us.

0393312836|2.0|I have read quite a few of the reviews on 'Amazon' and everyone of them praises the book highly. They talk about the inventiveness and energy of the language, the sympathy they have for the major character Alex, especially when his Nature is forcibly changed, and he loses the ability to be himself , including the ability to enjoy Beethoven's music. They speak about the skill in depicting the main character's alienation, and the dreary world of an imagined future technical dystopia.<br /><br />They speak about a vision Burgess presents, and the fact that in spite of the language containing many at first non- understandable slang terms, that the work is nonetheless really understandable.<br /><br />I didn't like the book. I read quite a bit of it. I just could not get into it. I do not like violence even fictional violence. I simply could not find any of this entertaining or amusing, however I know the great gifts Burgess has as writer.<br /><br />I may be wrong, but I simply do not like this one.

B00005JOVN|3.0|After watching the preveiws for \\"Poseidon\\" I promised myself that I would go see this film, now after hearing what the Critics had to say about \\"Poseidon\\" I REALLY thought about breaking that promise and spending my $6.50 on another film but after somewhat of debate I thought that I would give it a try because there have been some movie I have really liked that the critics didnt ..., now I wouldnt say that about \\"Poseidon\\" but I can honestly say that I was entertained, personnaly I thought that this was you besic Popcorn summer movie, it's got exemplary Special-Effects, pretty decent acting, action-packed suspenceful scenes and scenarios & lots of Screaming!, though a few times you feel like you are seeing the same thing over and over again (Talk, Swim, disaster, Scream, Run, Swim, Get Higher, Calm Down, Talk, Disaster, Scream, Run ... ect: you get the picture!), but some parts wre thrilling and even suspencful!. I am not going to lie and say that this film would be good regardless of the budget because that, my dears would be a big fat lie ... because if this movie would'nt have spent the 150,000,000$ that it had, than this film would'nt have been good at all! Overall though everything went pretty smoothly  and the budgets basically fought through the dragging screenplay to put together a decent summer flick, dont see it if your real picky., and certianlly do NOT go into it with the 70's \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" in mind because if you do than I can say that you will most definatly be let down. <br /> <br />Overall: C+
B000F48CD8|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this cd. Being a huge White Stripe's fan I had hoped for a good dose of Jack White. Jack's influence is heard but he relegates himself to the background on this production whereas I feel he is a natural frontman. It's good music no doubt, I just think Jack can do better.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I have been an X-men fan for a long time and after seeing \\"The Last Stand\\" I have to admit that I was 100% entertained, this film is no oscar movie but really it's not made to be, it's made to entertain summer movieveiwers..., those of you who enjoy action as well as a few outlandish ideas and concepts will have alot of fun with X3. <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman returns as the tough bladed-beast \\"Wolverine\\", he brings along the usual gang with him as well, such as Halle Berry playing the weather controlling \\"Storm\\", the Metal controller \\"Magneto\\" or \\"Eric\\", as well as a few more (\\"Iceman\\", \\"Pyro\\", Jean, Professor Xaveir, \\"Mystique\\" & Rouge), the cast throughout the movie fails to let down the audience with the unique and powerful mutant abilitys. <br /> <br />Though you do get the feel (from the film, other than the end...) that 'The Last Stand\\" is the last installment of the X-men series you are most definatly misled, Ralph Winter, 1 of 3 of the Producers of \\"The Last Stand\\" has said to Entertainment Weekly that \\"This is not the last movie, there are a lot more stories. There's a wealth of charactors, we tried to fit \\"Angel\\" into three movies and as you know this is the first time we got him in!\\" ..... So as you can see ... dont worry there will be many more X-Men films for you to enjoy in the future! <br /> <br />So as a whole this was a really fun ride that with held by far the best special-effects of the series BUT, I cant lie and tell you that this movie is great or even as good as the first film (it is better than the 2nd..) because it really isnt, the story line is actually quite basic, the acting as I am sure you guessed is most definatly up to par and the direction overall is decent if not better, \\"The Last Stand\\" is truly a smart, fun and cool way to start off you movie watching summer! <br /> <br />P.S. By the way I just saw the numbers for what the film made on its opening weekend - it made a huge amount of just over 120,000,000$ dollars! that puts it on pace to easily pass all the other suppossed summer Box Office Hits such as, Mission Impossible 3, The Da Vinci Code, Over the Hedge & Poseidon! <br /> <br />Overall: B
B0000BWVCM|4.0|X-Men 2 is the best of the X-Men series (through part 3 thus far) and one of the best comic-based films of all time. <br /> <br />The plot of the film concerns the U.S. Government's response to the events of the first film, and one rogue politician who is determined to wipe mutants, good, evil and otherwise, off of the face of the Earth. <br /> <br />The strengths of this film are the strengths of the series: wonderful casting (Patrick Stewart as Professor X is simply perfect, Hugh Jackman *is* Wolverine, etc.); stunning special effects; clever plot twists and turns; a beautifully nude, if slightly blue and unnerving, Rebecca Romijn. This film, in particular, allows us to spend a little time with some of the \\"secondary\\" characters and really builds up their personalities, particularly Ice Man and Pyro. Nightcrawler is a wonderful addition to an already strong ensemble cast. <br /> <br />I do wish that Cyclops had been given more--his character is probably the most poorly used of the series--but other than that, there is little to complain about in this film. It's a whole lot of fun and well worth the watching.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X & Y by Coldplay is what Radiohead would sound like if they weren't depressed. This music is uplifting and inspiring. Intelligent lyrics and excellent guitar solos. This is one of few CDs I have given five stars. In my top three recordings of the millenium along with the two U2 releases.
B00005JOVH|3.0|X-Men-The Last Stand is a still worth watching despite the less interesting script and a change of director. It's a purely entertaining popcorn movie for all ages. I didn't think this one was as good as the first two, but it's more explosive and got an all-star cast. So glad to see Ellen Page(Marion Bridge) playing Kitten Pryde, she's the finest Canadian actress of her generation. Fellow Canadian actor Shawn Ashmore reprises his Bobby Drake role with more screentime this time. Not bad. A few new characters entered this film including the unrecognizable Kelsey Grammer playing Beast, and some other new  principle mutants also appeared. I was quite surprised to see Shohreh Aghdashloo as Dr. Kavita. Althogh she only had about five minutes of screentime, she was as always scene-stealing. Remember her from House of Sand and Fog? I think the briefly appeared Angel character was under-developed. Then there is the departure of some lead mutants, that I think was an indication that this is indeed the last installment. Would have love to see more of Mystique, but she had less than ten minutes this time. Even Storm(Halle Berry) is underexposed this time, kind of wasted. This film allowed Ian McKellan,Hugh Jackman and Famke Janseen to dominate the movie. The director also neglected to make the most of another talented actress like Anna Paquin, who had very low-key scenes to work with. I think Phoenix/Jean Grey was very striking, and it's a great opportunity to let Janseen shine with scenes that call for her to have mix expressions, but I couldn't help thinking how similar her character is to Carrie White. I enjoyed the film, but it's not so good that I would want to see it again in DVD.
B00005JOVH|4.0|***This Entire Review Is A Spoiler***<br /><br />When you change directors, you invariably change direction.  That is the source of all the problems that X3 had.  Bryan Singer had a specific vision for the series, which is impossible for Brett Ratner, to reproduce.  When Singer jumped ship to do \\"Superman Returns,\\" this film and franchise was doomed.  As always, the fans (i.e. the people who pay YOUR bills) were hurt the worst.<br /><br />This film focuses on two threads: Magneto's War and Phoenix.  In order to make this film work, they had to eliminate the deadwood, viz. Professor X (whose sole purpose in the first two films was not to lead, but to get captured) and Cyclops (who, in order to highlight Wolverine as field commander, was written as a wienerschnitzel).  As I watched the two deaths, I realized that 20 Century Fox was taking a cue from TV Fox's \\"24.\\"  Sudden deaths make for an exciting story, because you don't know who is going to go next, but at times--as happens in \\"24\\"--the unpredictably can itself become too predictable.<br /><br />So with the leader and the field commander gone, the questions is--will Halley Barry want to come back as the next field commander, and will Kelsey Grammer want to dawn the blue fir again?  Or maybe the oblique reference to transferring the consciousness into the body of another being means they can have Professor X back, but with a less-expensive actor?<br /><br />Phoenix was mostly a prop, and as I saw her rather disturbing black-eyed, wild-haired psychic whirlwind sequences, I kept thinking about the previews for the Omen remake.  The Phoenix Seduction and Tragedy only works if you like Cyclops.  By writing Cyclops they way they did, Singer painted Ratner into a corner.  And, once again, the fans (i.e. the people who pay YOUR bills) were hurt the worst.<br /><br />The film is at its best--and most intelligent--when it focuses on Magneto's War.  It is a metaphor for racism (Mystiques reference to her \\"slave name\\" is smouched from Malcolm X), prejudice, and the Holocaust. The question of the anti-mutant of course, reminds us of the nature/nurture discussion and the hot issue of curing homosexuality.  Of course this is propaganda, but so was Star Trek, Twilight Zone, and Ray Bardberry.  The real question is with this is \\"Are you thinking, or merely being entertained?\\"<br /><br />In regards to the mutant cure, I am glad that they brought out how mutations affect people differently.  Mutants who could pass off for normal, such as Wolverine and Story hated the cure, but Rogue and Beast understood why a person would want to de-mutant themselves.<br /><br />There is a third thread--the subplots, all of which go by too quickly.  The Angle subplot--you got to love that introduction!--is not a subplot, but more of a book-end.  When we last saw Iceman, he was willing to work around Rogue's \\"problem,\\" but now he seems to have turned on a dime.  This makes him seem less heroic, and after Rogue is \\"cured,\\" what is going to happen to Sprite-Shadowcat-Kitty Pryde? And speaking of Kitty Pryde, where is Colossus's heart? And if Leech's anti-mutant is only mimicked, not replicated, will Rogue go back to her poison touch? And if Mystique goes back to being a mutant, why revenge will she wreck on Magneto?  Heh-heh-heh!<br /><br />Another sub-sub plot was the crowd sizes at the cur clinics.  Apparently there are a lot of mutants--low-level class one and two mutants.  This of course raises a deeper question--if so many people are mutants (factoring out the wannabes), it seems like they would represent a substantial voting block.  This would explain why Beast had such a high office, and why you could never have a Project Wideawake.<br /><br />Despite these problems, Brett Ratner did a marvelous job in keeping with the feel of the first two movies.  I thought the film worked well, and would welcome Rater to come back and do a film four.<br /><br />PS--so will the next film be a part four, or will it be a reboot?four, or will it be a reboot?
B00005JKG5|4.0|I have not seen this Flashdance or any of Jennifer Beals' movies or the L-Word. I had to check this movie out because I had just worked with her recently on a low budget indie thriller, I won't give out the name out. Everyone told me that this is her best movie of her career. I think they might be right. I really enjoyed this movie, and the dance and music is fabulous. It's so '80s!, and Beals was at the top of her game. They could get Janet Jackson or Madonna to dance like that, but not act as good I don't think. I totally can relate to her role as a struggling artist having to work unlikeable job to pay the bills and trying to launch a career as a dancer. It's a very inspirational and entertaining film. A must-see for JB fans!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|First class script, Master Directing, Fantastic Actors/Actresses, What more can you ask for? <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain is a love story that will truly change who you are, and how you view the world.

0385507755|5.0|I have read this book and there is a lot of hype about the \\"truth\\" contain within..however, \\"truth\\" is relative.  As a former crack addit, I can tell you this book is well-written and reflects the hell of drug use.  <br /> <br />In addition, it was recommended by a fellow user to me.  He said the book changed his life (for the better).  So, to me, if this book rings that \\"true\\" to those of us who have lived it and can help even one person, then this man should be congratulated not smeared!  I loved it.  It IS TRUE and I have recommended it time and time agin to others... <br /> <br />James - Bless You - The kid is still sober an expecting his first child!! \\"D\\"
B000002UJQ|5.0|Like many previous reviewers, I only listened to this album because my younger brother gave it to me and encouraged me to listen to it a few times.  I did so and put it away concluding that it was \\"too weird\\" for a classic rocker like me (think Beatles, Who, LZ, Pink Floyd, REM, U2, etc.). <br /> <br />Then, I was loading my collection into my Ipod and Airbag came on automatically as I was ripping OK Computer.  Something about the song just grabbed me and the album hasn't let go since then.  The only albums I can compare it to in terms of the effect it has on me are Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and parts of \\"Dark Side\\". <br /> <br />It is not the most rocking album of all time or the most lyrical, but it is easily the best album I have heard since at least 1995 (excluding my brother's albums).  If it hits you the right way, it will make you happy to be alive just listening to it.  I'm not a good enough musician to analyze why, but it gets to places inside me that virtually no other music has ever reached. <br /> <br />I wish there was a way to know if it will have this impact on you without getting the album and listening to it ten times or so, but to me the potential reward is well worth the investment.  One possibility is to get \\"The Bends\\" first.  While they are both great albums, to me \\"The Bends\\" hit me much sooner in the listening cycle.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|This movie is definitely in my top ten of all time. Too much awesomeness for words. FREEDOM FOREVER!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have read the novel four times, watched the 1995 A&E production numerous times, even seen the 1980 miniseries. But for me, this big screen adaptation is the best. True, it takes some liberties with the story: No way Elizabeth will go around Meryton without her bonnet, no way will Bingley come to visit Jane in her sick bed, no way Darcy will come into Lizzy's room when she is in her nightgown; Lady Catherine won't come in the middle of the night or Darcy won't propose in an ancient temple but these are not the important points. The important points are the realistic approach to the story, the gorgeous visuals, the great performances (especially by the lead actors) and the liveliness of the production. <br /> <br />The film may seem a bit too hurried to those not familiar with the story. There is a lot going on and scenes go rushing along but the film does a good job of squeezing as many scenes and characters as possible in a 2 hour time frame. Mr Wickham is a bit left out, he just comes and goes but to tell the truth the actor's performance is so bad, it is better not to see more of him. <br /> <br />Having considered Colin Firth as the ultimate Darcy for years, I am totally converted now. Matthew Macfadyen is the ultimate Darcy. His face conveys a whole lot of emotions and although Darcy was not supposed to be so expressive of her admiration of Elizabeth, I think there is no better way to convince the audience that he IS \\"most ardently\\" in love with Lizzy in around 2 hours. Keira Knightley is very good too. Although she giggles a little bit too much, her eyes and her voice express her emotions very well. <br /> <br />Tom Hollander interprets Mr Collins differently here. In the 1995 version, Mr Collins was merely servile; here he comes across as quite cunning.  <br /> <br />Joe Wright directs the film brilliantly. The Assembly dance is so  exhilarating; you can almost smell the sweat. The ball scene is really superb.  <br /> <br />If you are a Jane Austen purist and like some Lord Of the Rings fanatics who think Sam's donkey shouldn't be excluded from the story in Lord of the Rings because the relationship between the man and the donkey was very important, you may find a lot of faults with this film. If not, you will certainly love it. <br /> <br />
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Finally the 194 minute version is out!  <br />I don't know about you but when I left the theatre after having seen the earlier one, I felt so disappointed. Not because of Ridley's (marvellous) work but because it was so obvious people cut about a third of the film.  <br />I don't want to go into details about the acting - everyone is doing a terrific job here (although Eva Green is slightly disappointing - I think her very pretty, but for the acting part, she just doesn't touch me as deeply as the rest - and I'm not an Orlando fan!!!!) <br />What is new here is that finally the film flows and takes the time it needs to tell the story. After all this is about a crusade and as everybody knows these took quite a long time.  <br />In the earlier version there was a bit of drama in the beginning, then suddenly wooops, there they were in Jerusalem.  <br />This time around, characters are introduced with more depth and the tensions are being let grow(as if they have been set free, terrific!), because of additional time and storyline. Of course I wouldn't have expected any less from Ridley, but when I come to think of all his other movies, this one is definately my favorite.  <br />Sure, it is part fiction, part truth, but a commercial movie cannot depend on history alone.  <br />In Kingdom of Heaven Ridley uses filmmaterial, color, setting, simply everything to paint a perfect picture (sometimes, I think, to a greater extent and with better results than in his other movies). Every scene, no matter if it's a still or right in the middle of an action sequence, is built like a painting. <br />On top of that comes a story with characters that stay with you for days, weeks, months even. Love and honor, loyalty and faith - isn't that what keeps us going? No matter what color, race or religion? <br />A beautiful movie and as such a must-have for every film fan.
6304712944|5.0|This is the way musicals should be.  I'm not saying that Camelot is better than all the rest, but that it's a drama that just happens to be a musical.  It is all centered around King Arthur, (A wonderful Richard Harris) and his wife Guenevere (played by a beautiful Vanessa Redgrave) and what happens when Guenevere haves an affair with Arthur's friend Lancelot (Played by a handsome Nero, but Nero's acting isn't that great.) <br /> <br />Harris is perfect for Arthur.  He's strong and yet fragile when it comes to his cheating jenny. <br /> <br />Vanessa Redgrave turns in another great performance.  When this film was released, it received mixed reviews, but Redgrave always was praised. <br /> <br />Nero.  Well, Redgrave makes up for his lack of talent.  I will tell you that this film is three hours long and it does feel that long, only when Nero is on the screen, but the other actors back up his scenes.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I played through 1/2 of the game a few years ago (it crashed half way through).  The DVD comes with a recap of sorts for those who want to refamiliarize themselves with the original plot, or for those who didn't play the game.  After that, you are thrown into a flimsy (if not absent) plot with no character developement (the hallmark of Final Fantasy games).  The musical Score was amazing, and I highly recommend the CD, but as for the movie, I watched it, and have no idea what happened.
0452282152|5.0|If like me, you read many of the reviews of this book that are less than positive, you might think it's going to be a boring book with little substance.  I'm glad I read the book before I read the reviews.<br /><br />If you are seeking action, depth, subplots, and a complex story line, this book is just not for you.  It's a quiet, almost dreamy tale of one person's musings on the model/subject of a famous painting by an enigmatic artist.<br /><br />Perhaps you're like me:  you've just finished a long string of involved novels, with story lines that constantly jump around in time (Time Travelers Wife, The Sparrow, Kite Runner, etc.) and just want a pleasant, linear story to read on a rainy saturday afternoon - then Girl with a Pearl Earring is just the thing.  It's very well written, with a well-crafted, if limited, glimpse into 2 very small neighborhoods in Delft, Holland.  It's not a sweeping saga of how life was in 17th century Netherlands, or detailed chronical of the life of Johannes Vermeer, as some reviewers have complained it should have been.<br /><br />It's more of a delicate watercolor that simply suggests a life that might have been;  the girl in the painting could have been anyone - why not Griet?  The book to me is as evocative as the Vermeer painting on which it's based - we know very little (if anything) about the girl in the painting, but she still speaks  to us.  I think that Tracy Chevalier has succeeded in crafting her story with the same simple mystery that haunts, frustrates, and pleases us when we see the actual painting.<br /><br />The story is simple - a young girl is forced to seek work to support her family after her father loses his sight in a work-related accident.  She becomes the newest maid in the home of Johannes and Catharina Vermeer, and slowly finds herself becoming more involved in the master painter's work, to the point of becoming his subject.  That's really about it - everything else just consists of the details of that process.  The ending, while not at all dramatic, is fitting with the rest of the story.  And while fictional, you'll never look at the famous Vermeer painting (from which the book takes its title) in the same way.<br /><br />I hope my review helps put some of the negative reviews in perspective.  Don't read it for all the wrong reasons!<br /><br />5 well-deserved stars.f that process.  The ending, while not at all dramatic, is fitting with the rest of the story.

0385336691|4.0|Reacher has become a big success - this hit high on the best seller lists in its first week - but one has to wonder if that's a good thing. Oh, you'll finish it quickly - Child is too good to let up on the narrative drive, but you may still be hungry afterward. Almost everything about the book is weaker than its predecessors. You'll miss any backstory; you'll miss any emotional connection between Reacher and his partner. You'll miss the action and figure out the ending way too early. You'll forgive, but not forget, how arbitrary the setup seems and you'll look back on past villains with fondness while still racing to see what happens to this one. Mostly you'll miss any personalization of Reacher. What happened to the character who fell in love with his boss's daughter, who deeply mourned the deaths of his mother, brother, and former commanding officer? You'll miss any characters as vivid as the blond FBI agent and the battered Hispanic wife. You'll finish the book and put it down and you probably won't go back to it. But you won't regret it - Reacher at half-mast still stands taller than most of his action/mystery cohorts (he'd eat Elvis Cole for breakfast and have Spenser for dessert.) Maybe, Mr. Child, you might take just a little longer on the next one. Thanks.  ADDENDUM  In retrospect, this review may be a little unfair. As one who loves serial characters in suspense fiction, I will always start from the first book and work my way forward, but given that it took Reacher several books before he hit the bestseller lists, Mr. Child and his publisher may have decided that their best route was to provide single episode fictions that don't presume prior knowledge of the main character, and if that is the case, then most of my comments about lack of backstory can be ignored. (I still think Running Blind is the best of the Reacher stories but much of its effectiveness comes from the sexual tension between Reacher and the FBI agent which is caused by his ongoing relationship with a character from earlier novels.)  That being said, this is still inferior to the previous Reacher, One Shot, which also can be read without prior knowledge of the Reacher universe. So, if you're looking for the complete Reacher experience, start at the beginning. You'll still be reading when you get to The Hard Way and it's still worth the cover price. But if you're going to start farther down the line, pick up One Shot first. Whatever you decide, you have some great reading ahead. (Maybe Child should consider a \\"director's cut\\" of his more recent novels where he builds in some backstory for dedicated Reacherians.)
B0006J28L4|5.0|What makes this a 'must-see' film is it's depiction of emotional, spiritual and logical growth of not just one man but a nation.  This film chronicles the life of Malcolm Little (X) from his early days as a zoot-suited hustler known as \\"Detroit Red\\" through to his spiritual maturity after his pilgrimage to Mecca, as a Black Muslim by the name of El Hajj Malik El Shabazz.  I do want to make mention that Washingtons performance was TOP-NOTCH and mezmerizing to say the least.  As X, Washington shows his growth from confused young one to racist and then finally to mature man of the people who understands what it really takes to lend a helping hand.  As a white man I will never be able to understand 'fully' what it feels like to be a minority, or appreciate what strength it must take to survive in our society, but what I appreciated about Malcolm's story is that he went from a bitter and angry man who swore white men were all devils to finally understanding that it wasn't the color of the mans skin that made him the devil but the color of his heart.  It's a shame it took him so long to understand that part of the equation for if he had known that beforehand he would have been a much greater help for his people.  This film is not forgiving nor does it candy coat anything.  As a white man who knew very little about Malcolm X beforehand I found myself loathing the man for quite a bit of the film for his views and beliefs contrasted starkly with mine.  I feel that to battle racism with more racism defeats the purpose of equality, so for me to see the man Malcolm became helped me to understand why he is regarded so highly because, while he started off on a wrong foot his desire to HELP his people resulted in him truly understand by which means he should go about it.  This film is perfectly exicuted on all fronts and shows the after effects of racism but also what we can do as people to help battle any further issues.  We are all created equal and appear one color before god so why should it be any different before one another.  What I appreciated about this film is it showed well that racism is not one sided, it's not a whites hate blacks thing for it plays the other way too, for Malcolm and his associates started off racist, hating a man for his skin color and they failed to help the black community and only served to create more problems...but as Malcolm learned, when putting aside the color of ones skin and seeing them for the person they are inside we can all make a difference and learn to live together as brothers and sisters.  Excellent message.

B00005JOVH|5.0|Dispite what the critics say, 'The Last Stand' is not that hard to understand.  The humans have created a cure thanks to a young mutant with the ability to cause other mutants powers to be null and void in his presence and they intend to hold this out to the public for their use.  For any mutant who wants a normal life, here is your chance to get it.  The only problem is that Magneto and his band of baddies decides to wage war on the humans in protest.  It's at this point the humans decide to use this cure as a weapon against mutantkind which results in an all out war.  In the meantime, Jean Grey (Famke) who was assumed dead has come back to life in the form of Phoenix, her alter ego and has joined forces with Magneto.  The X-Men must fight to save the world from Magneto while battling there emotional ties to Jean (especially Wolverine)  Also, we have some mutants (Beast and Rogue primarily) who may even welcome the cure, and Rogue who has concerns about her relationship with Bobby (Iceman) beings that she can't touch him, and when he starts showing interest in Shadowcat, Rogue strongly conciders taking the cure for herself.  With the inclusion of mutants like Jugernut, Shadowcat, Angel and Beast you'd think it may get confusing, but the film flows nicely and explains everything very well.  It may not be the best of the bunch (X2 was by far the best) it still holds your interest and delivers solid hollywood entertainment, and Miss Famke delivers the best acting in the bunch as the very tempermental Phoenix.  I do have to say they went out of there way to make sure a fourth was damn near impossible, but even at that, they ended on a great note despite what the critics have to say about it.
1577314808|2.0|I found this book to be very light in actual substance. There are more meditation techniques (not many) in the book than real spiritual content and philosophy. I suppose it could be more helpful and practical if the reader is experiencing a difficult situation in life. As it is explained in the beginning, this book is a collection of seminars and, in my view, was not the most enjoyable reading. Again, simple directions, but requires enough patience to follow thorough the jungle of words. I also believe it is more targeted towards women readers. Having said this, I know many (mostly women) who love this book and have read it more than once. To me, however, the entire book can be summarized in the following verses from the Gita which was written 1000 BCE.    \\"In man brooding on object of senses, attachment to them springs up. Attachment begets craving and craving begets wrath. (2.62)    Wrath breeds stupefaction, stupefaction leads to loss of memory, loss of memory ruins the reason, and the ruin of reason spells utter destruction; (2.63)    But the disciplined soul, moving among sense-objects with the senses weaned from likes and dislikes and brought under the control of Atman (soul; conscience), attains peace of mind. (2.64)    Peace of mind means the end of all ills; for the understanding of him whose mind is at peace stands secure. (2.65)    The undisciplined man has neither understanding nor devotion; for, for him who has no devotion, there is no peace, and for him who has no peace whence happiness? (2.66)    For when his mind turns after any of the roaming senses, it sweeps away his understanding, as the wind a vessel upon the waters. (2.67)\\"
B000F3TBIO|2.0|I'm sorry, but this material just sounds so tired. Instantly dated. This record doesn't bring anything new to the table. I would even contend that it swings the pendulum back. This stuff might have sounded fresh in the '90s. And even then it would have been considered just an O.K. record. <br /> <br />It's perplexing that such an amazing list of collaborators could yield a product that sounds this diluted, mediocre and well, just plain boring.

6305090564|5.0|To me Deep Rising reminds me of films such as  The Mummy, with everything under water crossed with Jurassic Park style creature chasing its lunch, I mean the ship crew around. I have watched it a few times all ready and this is the kind of a movie that only gets better with every viewing. <br /> <br />What is great about Deep Rising is the consistency with strong deliverance of plot and action. There are no dull moments and people die in some surprising deaths and you really don't know who is going to make it, since no one looks safe. I mean how many movies start of with a whole cruise ship crew vanishing in the middle of the ocean? <br /> <br />Yes this movie is a few years old and the special creature effects are computer generated in most parts but it was really a blast to watch and to laugh at some clever jokes. <br /> <br />Treat Williams looks like a space commander in his ship playing the small boat captain, John Finnegan with goofy sidekick Kevin J. O'Connor as Joey \\"Tooch' Pantucci (who also appeared in The Mummy - you just cant miss his squeaky voice) on board with fabulous Famke Janssen who plays a jewel thief along with some darkly clad characters on a secret mission with a lot of guns. We also have Djimon Hounsou who's pretty ruthless and unfriendly, Cliff Curtis who usually plays some South American drug lord who is pretty funny in this one and Wes Studi as the bad guys team captain. <br />What is really entertaining is watching all the opposing characters try and work together to abandon the cruse ship in one piece and let me tell you, the two hours go fast and the guys get eaten even faster. The story is beyond trying to outsmart a creature that ate everyone on  the ship and gets behind the story line to how it all came to happen, for there is a reason. <br /> <br />The best part was the ending, it was insane and it always makes me wish for a part two, because the end is crazy good and no you will never guess how it ends, but I would love to see it continue.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|The Truman Show is truly an amazing piece of film. It is delightful to see Carrey in a serious role, but he plays it astoundingly. The story is based on a young man that has been adopted by a television producer at birth. His whole life has been filmed - it's alive, 24/7 television and radio show. The story in this motion picture is brilliant and a truly creative idea and shows the demise of our society. Well acted, great story, and ultimately intruiging.<br /><br />Rent it - you'll want to purchase the DVD afterwards.
B000EYK4KI|4.0|Many people have been ripping this release apart without so much as a glance at the product itself. While the DVD may fall short of other recent Collector's Edition DVDs, such as the Alien films, this is a superb presentation, with some genuinely interesting Special Features. <br /> <br />What has sparked the most debate about this release is easily the \\"Unrated\\" cut itself. The film is largely the same, running only 6 minutes longer than the original cut. The added scenes are interesting - additional dialogue with the counsellor in the opening, a few extra dialogue sequences between Pitt and Jolie before they learn each others identities, and a handful of alternate takes for certain sequences. Perhaps the most notable - and  most controversial - is the extended love scene halfway through the film. The scene is very steamy, but those expecting excessive raunch or skin from the gorgeous stars will be disappointed. This is a love scene, not a sex scene, and there is only the tiniest hint of skin from both actors, with Pitt (or Pitt's body double, as the shot in question is from the neck down) showing the most. <br /> <br />And far the the SPECIAL FEATURES go, the disc is very careful not to double-dip. It includes: (1) Deleted Scenes, including an alternate ending. None of the deleted scenes are repeated from the original reelase, and many are well worth a watch. (2) A feature-length commentary from director Doug Limon that, while informative, offers little insight not mentioned in the original release's commentaries. (3) Doug's Film School. This section is essentially a breakdown of abandonded concept and sequences that never made it on film. Of note is a lengthy alternate version of the Desert sequence, located at a snowy mountaintop and ending in a hand-to-hand battle between a masked Pitt and Jolie, as well as several animatics for various sequnces throughout the films. Also of note is the inclusion of the deleted \\"villain\\" sequences mentioned of the commentary ofthe first release's commentary. (4)Confidential Files. This is actually where the deleted scenes are located. Also included in the \\"file\\" is a 4-minute gag reel, and a hidden Easter Egg (another deleted scene). (5) Behind the scenes documentary. This 30-minutes featurette offers more insight than that of the original release, as well as a significat amount of B-Roll footage from several of the film's major set piees, including the in-house battle and the desert scene. (6) Photo Gallery. 2 dull on-screen scroll-through photo galleries. <br /> <br />While this reelase has met with much criticism, those who enjoyed the movie should be informed that this is one of the rare double-dips that doesn't FEEL like a double-dip. No features are repeated from the original release, and the unrated movie itself is different enough from the theatrical version that it is well worth owning both versions. Also, the picture is much clearer and less grainy, and the sound more crisp. <br /> <br />The disc also includes a DVD insert, with random facts about the film anda Chapter List (36 Chapters). <br /> <br />Grade: B+
B000A78Z82|5.0|I bought Banhart's first album when it came out and was a little turned off (honestly it's grown on me and I really like it now) but at the time it really turned me off. I found his two following albums easier to digest and very enjoyable but Cripple Crow is his strongest and most accessible album yet. The album is mellow and enjoyable and beyond that it is a sign of things to come. This album makes it clear that Devendra Banhart is the future of folk music and the future's so bright I gotta were shades (do you like that Timbuk 3 reference? You gotta say this review helped you just for that).
B000001FGG|5.0|About two years ago I wrote a review in which I praised \\"How The West Was Won\\". Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a magnificent album, but my oh my, when I heard this piece everything changed. I mean one song to be precise. No, it's not \\"crossroads\\" and if it's not \\"crossroads\\" it must be \\"Spoonful\\". I have in my own collection \\"Live at Fillmore East\\" by The Allman Brothers Band, which has been hailed by some as the greatest live album. Sure, I like it, it's a little piece of heaven at times, if you know what I mean. But even Duane's slide guitar can't compare to  Cream's playing on \\"Spoonful\\". And I'm not describing it in terms of a live or not live song. The sheer power, beauty and genius that is captured in those wonderfull 16 minutes is hard to explain. It has absolutely no longueurs whatsoever despite its length. Their improvisation is unbelievable. I've just never heard any music that sounded better. This album is worth buying for \\"Spoonful\\" alone.

B00005JOVJ|3.0|** ½<br /><br />Two brief prologues; the first explaining how Jean Grey came to Charles Xavier's school twenty years ago, the second showing a young boy, seven or eight, trying to hide his wings from his father by cutting, grating and shaving them off begin \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\". Then the action picks up at the dam, where \\"2\\" ended. Scott, a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden) is taking the death of Jean (Famke Janssen) very badly and decides to ride off on his motorcycle. Soon, he finds himself at the lake and the dam and is surprised when Jean appears and walks towards him. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) picks this up as well and sends Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the location. There, they find an unconscious Jean and only Scott's signature glasses. They return to the school and Xavier puts Jean under, trying to control her bad, reckless second persona, Phoenix. Meanwhile, Beast (Kelsey Grammer), the Secretary of Mutant Affairs, learns Worthington Pharmaceutical has created a cure for the Mutant gene, news which instantly divides both the Mutant and Human communities. Magneto (Sir Ian McKellan) fears it will be used as a weapon against the Mutants and is determined to destroy it, but first, he has to release Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), who has been captured by the government. Along the way, we meet new characters as the story leads to a dramatic confrontation on Alcatraz Island, where Worthington Pharmaceutical is based, and storing the source of their cure.<br /><br />\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" is pretty much the definition of a `summer movie'. A \\"sequel\\", based on a \\"comic book\\", filled with lots of \\"special effects\\" and \\"action\\"; these are the buzz words you are likely to find reprinted in the newspaper ads, touting the merits of the film. \\"Last Stand\\" has a surprising amount of story as well, but the story doesn't help develop the characters, new or old, or some of the relationships. If you haven't seen the previous two films, you might be lost.<br /><br />As the story begins working through its machinations, certain characters stand out, others fade into the background for large stretches of time. The new characters are given particularly short shrift. We quickly meet a new man who can turn himself into metal and seems to be very strong, but I didn't ever hear his \\"X-Men\\" name. At one point, Wolverine says \\"Hey, Tin Man?\\", but I suspect this was his sarcastic persona at work. The character seems to be around to simply provide strength. Another new student, a girl, who makes Rogue (Anna Paquin) jealous because her boyfriend, Bobby, aka, Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), shows an interest in her, can walk through walls and allow things to pass through her. Again, didn't catch her name. Magneto picks up a more interesting lot, including Juggernaut (a buffed up Vinnie Jones), who can run through anything, picking up incredible speed, and a guy who can replicate himself multiple times. Unfortunately, the film doesn't do a good job of creating all of these characters in a memorable way. I honestly couldn't remember many of their names and had to look them up on imdb.com.<br /><br />Also, the filmmakers make some strange choices regarding plotting. They introduce a particular story line and then the action cuts abruptly to another character or part of the story. You would naturally assume to return to the first story in the next scene, but more often than not, the filmmakers visit another storyline, then another, sometimes providing lengthy vacations from the first scene, before returning. At this point, you may have even forgotten the first scene. For instance, we visit an ominous government caravan transporting Mystique under heavy security. She has a funny exchange with one of the guards inside the large windowless truck. Then the action cuts to something else, and then something else again. Later, we join Magneto and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) addressing a crowd of Mutants. The villain soon learns one of the Mutants can sense where other Mutants are. \\"Can you locate someone for me?\\" Oh, right, he has to help Mystique escape. Three scenes later, we see an exterior shot of the mysterious caravan and Magneto standing in the middle of the country road.<br /><br />As the story begins unfolding, the filmmakers capture our attention with the sheer spectacle of everything; lots of action and special effects. But we don't learn anything about the characters, making it merely an exercise. As Wolverine and Storm run around (oddly, Storm is the only `good' Mutant never referred to by her human name) we see them in action, remarks are made to help establish something about their characters, but we never learn the meanings behind the remarks. As we meet the new characters, we don't learn about them either. Why is Angel (Ben Foster), Worthington's son, trying to cut off his wings in the prologue, but as a young man he seems very reluctant to take the cure his father has developed? In the first two films, director Bryan Singer provided these answers, or at least clues to them. Brett Ratner is more interested in blowing things up and using an incredible arsenal of special effects.<br /><br />Also, this is the first time I have ever felt that a villain was, well, sort of stupid. There is a rich tradition of super villains concocting outlandish plans for world domination and, yes, they tend to do stupid things. For instance, how often have villains stopped to tell James Bond their entire plan, only to give him the opportunity to free one of his hands? Hey, Blofeld! That's all it takes. One hand. But Magneto's plan in \\"Last Stand\\" has a fatal flaw. After he learns Worthington Pharmaceuticals has the source for their cure on Alcatraz Island, he decides to retrieve it and destroy it. Okay, check. No problem, so far. He'll just take a ferry or some ship to get there, right? Wrong. He decides to uproot the Golden Gate Bridge and move it to provide a walkway to the Island. An impressive sequence, providing a lot of work for Special Effects wizards, but how does this make sense? Through these actions, Magneto has provided both the X-Men and the military with an easier way to get to the Island and hamper his efforts.<br /><br />\\"Last Stand\\" is fun, mindless entertainment. But it could've been so much better. It is definitely not at the level of the previous two entries.<br /><br />Now that Bryan Singer has \\"Superman Returns\\" out of his system, hopefully he will return to helm \\"X-Men 4: The Next to Last Stand\\". Oh, trust me. There will be a sequel, despite all the statements from the actors about \\"Last Stand\\" ending the trilogy.here other Mutants are. \\"Can you locate someone for me?\\" Oh, right, he has to help Mystique escape.

B00005JP4U|5.0|Ok, let me get this straight. They made a documentary about Al Gore giving a lecture? About global warming? Okay, I'm already asleep. Snore. Yawn. Why don't I just stay home and save the money I would spend to take a nap.<br /><br />All kidding aside, if you know anything about Al Gore, you know this is a subject he is extremely committed to and passionate about. Very passionate. And after five years of some of the worst, most harmful environmental policy to ever come out of Washington, DC, there is no better time for \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\".<br /><br />I know many consider Gore to be less than a captivating speaker. But in \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" he comes across as a different man because he is so passionate and committed to the subject of global warming, he comes across as a different man. Informed, knowledgeable, conversational and persuasive, if he were like this during the election, there would be no Florida Recount in our history books. Okay, so that didn't happen. But the result is that Gore, much like Clinton and Carter, are trying to do something with their status to help better the world. Gore has long been an environmental advocate and it shows. He knows the facts inside and out; people have provided him with statistics, graphs, charts and more, and he uses them in this presentation.<br /><br />As Gore states, he has given the lecture more than a thousand times around the globe. Because of this, he is extremely comfortable addressing large audiences, giving them a lot of scientific research to digest. Remarkably, he makes it easy to understand, pointing out key facts, walking us through some of the more difficult to understand ideas and problems. He also knows when the audience needs a break and interjects humor here and there. At one point, he shows a spoof of an educational film animated by the people at \\"The Simpsons\\". At others, he makes fun of himself and his political ambitions and woes.<br /><br />Davis Guggenheim, the filmmaker, has apparently presented Gore's lecture virtually intact. As Gore moves around on a dais, clicking for the next slide, he makes persuasive points. But he also reaches a couple of key points. When this happens, the filmmakers smartly pull back from the lecture, giving us a portrait of a few key moments in Gore's life. The argument he makes in his lecture is persuasive, intelligent and well thought out, but because we learn more about the man making the presentation, these points have even more resonance. Not only do these moments give us more details about Gore, they also provide a respite from the scientific data, allowing us to absorb what we have learned.<br /><br />At one point, Gore states that the data is irrefutable and it appears to be. Remarkably, the filmmakers show footage of various people attacking Gore, or claiming the data he is presenting is not based in fact. Yet, we can see it for ourselves, right in front of us. And I am sure Gore could easily provide a bibliography of resources for us to check out all of the facts he uses. What would drive some of these people to attack Gore and this data? Some of the clips are from Gore's days as a Senator and Vice President, so some of that can be contributed to political parties trying to one-up each other. But currently, Gore does not hold political office, yet the current administration seems intent on giving every break to the worst polluters in the country, allowing them to make as much money as possible while they pollute and pollute and pollute. Gore shows a slide about this argument. Apparently, there is the thought good environmental policy will impact the economy. How do these same people explain the relationship between Toyota, Honda, Ford and GM? Toyota and Honda manufacture vehicles with far better gas mileage than their competitors and are much more successful because of it. An argument Gore makes very convincingly.<br /><br />Thankfully, Gore stays away from political bias. More or less. A couple of times, he makesfunny remarks about his failed run for the presidency, or he makes a pointed comment about the current administration, but by and large his comments are directed at us and what we should do to save our planet. The film isn't void of bias, but there could certainly have been a lot more. The fact the filmmaker and Gore showed some restraint makes his presentation even more persuasive.<br /><br />The film ends with a series of `calls to action' as the credits begin. Frankly, these aren't needed because Gore's arguments are so convincing. But they are effective. As one call to action states \\"Urge everyone you know to see this film.\\" Well, folks, that's what I am doing. Go and see this film. We need to do something before it is too late to do anything. Hopefully, this film will one day be viewed as a historical document of the beginning of a great change and not as a horror film.es, he makes funny remarks about his failed run for the presidency, or he makes a pointed comment about the current administration, but by and large his comments are directed at us and what we should do to save our planet.

B000F3TBIO|5.0|There is no doubt that this record is the best thing I have heard all year..maybe even last year as well.. <br />It opens up with the pretty yet wacky/insane five seconds..perfect way to begin this by making me want to riot and have some sex at the same time.  Mojo is of course incredibly cool and catchy single (b-side available on itunes), DOn't even Trip has some of my favorite lyrics and Getaway has Kool keith waht else do you need?  Neighborhood Spaceman has one of the catchiest melodies and coolest breakdowns that I've ever heard in my life..the song simply owns your face.. Kill the DJ is another really rockin tune with and old school hip hop feel somehow thrown in..now Caipirihinia is a little confusing.. but ehh, Celeberity Deathmatch is an amazing song with amazing words..Now someone on here seemed to think How U feelin was a waste..that confuses me as it is easily my favorite tune on this disc, that song simply has soul! I'm talking like old school Stevie WOnder soul!! SUcker is great and hot too..and the last track is one of the most amazing songs about our current situation ever..try and get that one out of your head.. <br />Buy this record...it is unique in that familiar way, amazing vocals, lyrics, and raps..  Of course the packaging is cool too..lyrics would be nice but ehh I'm not knocking a star off for that..
B00005JOVH|5.0|First off, I am not a comic book fan of X-Men.  I enjoyed the first two X-Men movies for what they were.....great acting, great action and very entertaining. <br /> <br />You have, by now, read all about the movie and it's plot (story line), so I won't bore you with the details. <br /> <br />Take it from me....If you are a die-hard X-Men comic book fan, you probably won't like this movie.   <br /> <br />If you liked the first two movies for what they were (as described above).....you will LOVE this movie. <br /> <br />The action is tremendous....the special effects are eye-popping...and the acting is fantastic.  I can't see how any other movie can top this one.  I was going to see \\"Superman Returns\\", but I honestly can't see how it can be any better than this one. <br /> <br />I look forward to when \\"X-Men: The Final Stand\\" arrives on DVD and will be first in line to purchase it (to go with my DVD's of the first two). <br /> <br />My recommendations to you.....DO go and see this movie and forget about the negative reviews you are reading.  If you liked the first two X-Men movies, you will enjoy this one....DO NOT leave the theatre when the credits roll.  Eventhough the credits run for quite awhile (seems like forever), you will be happy that you waited.
B000000993|5.0|Tool has always been a progressive band right from the get go. Undertow is Tool's first major release and is by no means the \\"lesser\\" of the rest. From the start Undertow grabs you and doesn't let go. The sound is angry, dark and mixed with underlying messages towards human nature. All together it creates this atmosphere for its listeners that matches the great music. This album may not be as progressive as later Tool releases, such as the epic Ænima, but shows signs of progressiveness in the final track \\"Disgustipated\\". My song ratings are as follows...<br /><br />1. Intolerance - 10/10<br />2. Prison Sex - 10/10<br />3. Sober - 10/10<br />4. Bottom - 9.5/10<br />5. Crawl Away - 10/10<br />6. Swamp Song - 10/10<br />7. Undertow - 9/10<br />8. 4 Degrees - 10/10<br />9. Flood - 8.5/10<br /><br />69. Disgustipated - 9/10<br /><br />Overall: 95% A-<br /><br />All together it is a great listen. Even if it may not be the best release by the band it is still amazing. Like I have said before, each release by Tool is unique and I love each one for many different reasons. If you can, go out and buy this album; it's truly signs of things to come for Tool

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Though this reviewer has read and heard many naysayers try to trash this film, upon large-screen viewing, I immediately and without hesitation named \\"V For Vendetta\\" the most intelligent piece of filmmaking ever screened.  Derived from Alan Moore's graphic novel, this allowed the writers (the brilliant Wachowski Brothers) and the director, James McTeigue, to fully explore the uses of anarchy as a means to achieve freedom from oppression.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving deserves accolades of the highest order for his amazing portrayal of the damaged man behind the mask.  Though cartoonish in some respects, \\"V For Vendetta\\" makes its point with style and cinematic panache.  Where \\"The Matrix\\" made one think about the boundaries of reality, \\"V For Vendetta\\" extends that process even further, asking the viewer, \\"How far would you go to protect your freedoms?\\"

0671646788|5.0|I am not sure I would have used the word \\"Magic\\" in the title.  Actually there is no magic in thinking big.  But the results of following the advice given by Dr. Schwartz might seem like magic.<br /><br />The simple truth is that most people have very self-limiting beliefs.  And as a result, think in terms of small achievements.  Change your way of thinking and you change your life.  As Schwartz points out, success is achieved \\"by following conscientiously and continuously a plan for self-development and growth.\\"  And he gives you a plan.<br /><br />The book is well written, full of interesting stories and great advice.  If you implement just a few of the ideas he puts forward, you will make considerable improvement in your life.<br /><br />Some of the more notable bits of wisdom:<br /><br />\\"We learn nothing from telling.  But there is no limit to what we can learn by asking and listening.\\"<br /><br />\\"Others see in us what we see in ourselves.\\"<br /><br />\\"People who tell you it cannot be done almost always are unsuccessful people ...\\"<br /><br />\\"Before you start out, know where you want to go.\\"<br /><br />The book contains a wealth of great information and wisdom.  However like any great advice, it is useless unless and until the reader takes action.  For the words to benefit you, you must take action.  A great blueprint for taking action, but taking action is up to the reader.
B0000019PA|5.0|After just a few listens, this cd becomes essential.  In the Aeroplane Over the Sea will become part of your musical identity.  The music seems anachronistic, like it came from some other era, time and place other than our own. How Extraordinary it is! What a beautiful dream, indeed.  Isn't it amazing that so many people have recognized this record's greatness, yet it's still completely out of the mainstream.  You'll find yourself putting this into the player over and over again.  Great stuff.
B00005JO20|5.0|When I was first going to see this film, I was a little apprehensive on whether it would live up to its hype. However, I was not to be disappointed. This film is one of the best I have ever seen (and I am an ultra movie-buff), and in my opinion beats all of the Lord of the Rings films, save for the Return of the King. The action was awesome (and at times, a bit brutal and excessive), and it got your heart-rate up and had you totally immersed. But, some of the films better moments were the quieter ones, the ones in which Kong interacts with the damsel Ann Darrow (an underwhelming performance by Naomi Watts, I'm sorry to say). Kong is so realistic that, sometimes he even seems human. The final fight sequence/ending scene is heart-rending, and it is difficult  to resist applauding Jackson's sheer ingenuity when the credits roll around. This film is definitely the true definition of an epic masterpiece, and though it has its problems, its a poignant film that's not to be missed!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|What makes this band so great is that you never know what to expect each time they release a new album. Pearl Jam's new record is no different. Their previous record, \\"Riot Act\\" was a solid cd full of great music much different from \\"Ten\\", and \\"Vitalogy\\", lets face it though, its 2006 and if PJ was still making the same sounding music from their early days why would they be such a legendary and band and so interesting to follow? \\"Pearl Jam\\" is one of the most refreshing sounding albums released to date in my opinion. It's almost as if this was their debut cd. Best songs on the cd can vary depending on who it's coming from but songs to look out for are \\"Life Wasted\\" (great chorus), \\"World Wide Suicide\\" (chart topping single), \\"Marker in the sand\\", \\"Unemployable\\", **\\"Parachutes\\"**, **\\"Come Back\\"** (reminded me of a Yellow Ledbetter and LBC kind of) and \\"Inside Job\\". It's been a while since we've heard such a powerful and unique sounding selection of songs from them.   <br />Pearl Jam came to Boston, MA May 24th and 25th and let me say this band still can put on an amazing show, and those who say this bands dead... when Eddie sang \\"Release\\" and \\"Alive\\" it was as if it was May 24th, 1991!! so check them out asap and grab this cd quick, this album will make your summer 10x better. <br /> <br />Peace & Love
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I can't say it much better than what has been stated already...just buy this album and you will not be disappointed! Yes, this is derivative, but in the best sense of the word. These guys masterfully meld together influences of old like Deep Purple, Uriah Heap, Zep, a little Sabbath (and the intro on \\"Woman\\" reminds me of Fastway - anyone remember Fastway?!) on to newer bands like Soundgarden, Kyuss and QOTSA (for whom they are a supporting act on an upcoming tour). My husband even hears some Styx (yes, they actually had some good stuff, not what you heard on the radio!). As far as the vocalist, and the classic rock purists will hate this, but he does sound like Jack White channeling Robert Plant (especially on \\"Apple Tree\\" and \\"Tales\\") and (I think) a little Burton Cummings from the Guess Who. But don't let that deter you - if nothing else, buy it on the strength of the first song \\"Dimension\\" which put a HUGE smile on my face when I cranked it up and heard the Sonics/Iggy-like scream at the beginning of the song - I knew it would be good! I was only going to give this 4 stars because it isn't really \\"original,\\" but then again what is these days?! So I went ahead and gave it 5 stars because I like every song on the album. My husband (43) and I (39) both like classic rock, but tend to differ when it comes to newer rock - I'm more White Stripes,Dirtbombs,Beck; he's more Secret Machines and British Sea Power...but we both agree that Wolfmother RRRAAAWWWKKKKSS!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie is a breakthrough from all the corruptions corporations have done to the movie industry. <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain is an extraordinary love story, in an oppressive time. I wish I can say that I would have wanted to see them together in this movie. Unfortunately, THAT would make this movie a fairy tale, since the world has not developed to that point of tolerance yet, and certainly not when and where the movie takes place. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Brokeback Mountain is a breakthrough for humanity, and I pay my salute to the actors and makers of this movie, for making this movie possible.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Why would it be? Part two was 12 years prior to this film. I went in not expecting a great film and I came out with pretty much what I expected. Not a great movie, but above average at the same time. <br /> <br />That's not to say all is good.... <br /> <br />The new John Conner put a strain on this movie. This kid simply isn't a good actor and it showed here. He's just not very likeable the way Edward Furlong was. Also, Arnolds heart appears to not be totally in this one. <br /> <br />The story is not so great. What is good is the action and Arnold still gives the film enough charisma to be good.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|While I enjoyed the original theater release of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", I was unsatisfied that the characters were only marginally developed. <br /> <br />After seeing Ridley Scott's Director's Cut of the movie, I feel like the studio was absolutely crazy to \\"gut\\" the theatrical release in the wholesale fashion they did. At last, the great casting was allowed to flesh out their roles and create characters -- good and bad -- that compel you to care about them. <br /> <br />In this wonderfully told story, the interaction of the characters is richly but efficiently developed, and you finally understand what makes Orlando Bloom's character so exceptional for a blacksmith, why the Queen of Jerusalem throws in with her arrogant and homicidal husband, and why a special relationship exists between the Saracens and Orlando Bloom's character. <br /> <br />Scott achieves a marvelous balance between the epic scope of the battles and the complex and fragile relationships of that time. I never had 3 hours and 19 minutes pass so quickly. <br /> <br />For those of you with HD systems, you will find the video transfer beautiful and the soundtrack breathtaking. <br /> <br />Finally, there are the ethical dillemas posed by the film, which are thought-provoking. One leaves the film disappointed in the failures of society, but hopeful and uplifted by the promise of new beginnings for admirable characters. A man who has a son like the protagonist would have accomplished much to make the world a better place.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Buy the series DVD.  Find out why Firefly has an extraordinary 5 star rating with rave reviews.  Great plots, acting, humor, and dialog.  You will like the programs even if you don't think you like sci fi or westerns. <br /> <br />I can't add much to the 2,500 reviews already posted, except to note that so many of us came to love and appreciate the series after it was off the air and without any prior connection to the series creator, Joss Whedon.  The point is:  anyone, young or old, traditional or fringe, TV addict or not, is very likely to really love Firefly. <br /> <br />Try it.  You'll be writing the 2,501st rave review yourself.
B000002J1U|5.0|Forget what people have said and what you may have read about Led Zeppelin III. This is my favorite Zep album for the fact that it combines every single musical aspect that makes this band as great as it is. The power of Immigrant Song, the glory of Celebration Day, the groove of Out on the Tiles. I could go on like that but I'm still leaving out the acoustic tracks that makes people denounce this album.  <br /> <br />The soul of this album belongs to Gallows Pole. Like any great song the build-up to the climax is musically stunning. The track combines all the abilites of each member of the group to an astounding song which I rank as one of their best ever. Robert Plant gives one of his best vocals on this one putting all the emotions of the music and lyrics into his singing. <br /> <br />I don't know any great band who gets slagged off for having acoustic tracks more then Zeppelin. Hats Off and Stomp are unique in their own way as they feel out of place on any other Zep album. They fit this album like a glove and shows the band are better musicians then given credit for. Sadly, this album fails to get its proper credit and is part of the early Zeppelin catalog which relied on raw power and the r&b foundation that made the group great. This album serves as the final Zeppelin offering before they became mega stars.  <br /> <br />I leave it to you but this album is rock n roll.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score for BATMAN BEGINS is mesmerizing and quite moving. There is a lot of pent up emotion, energy and haunting beauty just waiting to explode. This is not your typical BATMAN score established by Danny Elfman but it maintains an undercurrent of continuous movement and vibrancy and is just overwhelmingly enthralling. It examines a meaningful nature of the character and his motivations
B0000256KE|4.0|Highly influential, but in some ways like Roxy Music's debut, now dated, there are breadths of greatness all over this unique, strange, and oft times disturbing record album. FOR YOUR PLEASURE may have had a great influence over popular culture, but I can't claim that that influence is necessarily good. This record is a hard look, always Pop tinged, musical and challenging, but not often pretty. This record was perhaps more for the pleasure of ROXY's principles than for their listeners, in a strictly tortured or cathartic sense, but there is no doubt this album moves their music forward from ROXY MUSIC's brilliant, yet terminally underrated, eponymous debut ROXY MUSIC. The halls of a music school opener on the third track \\"Strictly Confidential\\" clues the listener that ROXY MUSIC's secret is love of the music.<br /><br />This record faired better than their debut in the ROLLING STONE RECORD GUIDE of 1979 that I reference constantly, garnering three stars, and I give this album another point than THE GUIDE did, yet despite this album's advances from the band's debut, I still rate it below that debut, ROXY MUSIC (which I rated highest with five stars). This is not because the songwriting is less brilliant here, it is even perhaps perfected on this second album. But here there is some obscuring of songs which on later Roxy Music albums are showcased, sans Eno-type effects and theoretically stripped of that influence, apparent on Roxy Music's third album STRANDED.<br /><br />So, I don't care for \\"The Strand\\" too much, at least by 2006, and find it a mixed bag including weak and dated lyrical moments (\\"a danceable solution...to teenage revolution\\") which seems most directed at their English fan base at the time than the void of eternity. Yet, it is stunning to know English juveniles were listening to albums of such sophistication as FOR YOUR PLEASURE in 1973 which the USA was not.<br /><br />Though I appreciate the necessary exploration vocally, aurally, and tonally with \\"The Bogus Man\\" it is ultimately, at nearly 10 minutes, a track to be skipped. Upon repeated listening, that track drags down the whole record. Also, contrary to other reviews, Brian Eno's contribution is most apparent on the title track, the album closer \\"For Your Pleasure.\\" I don't find such apparent influence on \\"The Bogus Man,\\" so, don't blame Eno. That title track, \\"For Your Pleasure,\\" is my own favorite, but this whole album is more like your oatmeal than a chocolate bar: necessary and good for you, but not necessarily always a \\"pleasure.\\" If you are easily challenged, the last and title track is one of the most challenging with Ferry's affected singing and its textural ending that in the 1970s would have had me rushing to my turntable to determine what was wrong and why it was making such a throbbing noise, which in fact may have been the point.  It can be  humbling, humorous, frightening, inspiring, and horrible to face TRUTH.  A woman's voice at the end here exclaims: \\"You didn't ask why.\\"<br /><br />Other tracks benefiting from Eno significantly: the lushly gorgeous and mesmerizing \\"Beauty Queen\\" and the insightful terminator \\"Editions of You;\\" the STONES inspired \\"Grey Lagoons\\" is a wonderful band effort with scorching results...all standouts on this remarkable record. \\"In Every Dream Home A Heartache\\" has less to do with Eno and more to do with Bryan Ferry's creepy lyric and eerie vocal for its legendary effect; who wants to listen to that every day?  Phil Manzanera's a** scorching finale is both supple and soothing with a cleansing reprise, the afterburner. Yet, it does leave one with the puzzling question of who are ROXY MUSIC ?? All these years later, everybody knows Brian Eno left Roxy Music after this album, but I must mention it, because the next album, also great, is stripped but no better because of it. Yet, FOR YOUR PLEASURE remains a rare, important, quite imperfect, but necessary and unique record for all who hear that it is, indeed, FOR YOURPLEASURE. Do you dare listen?  You didn't ask why.ten?  You didn't ask why.
037571457X|4.0|This is a deeply personal story, so each reader should set aside others' impressions in coming to it. Having said that, I offer my impressions for you to set aside.<br /><br />It's a graphic novel (or \\"comic\\"), in a plain and graphic style of B&W. The author makes good use of that feature, though: it conveys itself iconically rather than representationally, which gives it a quirky kind of visual potency. Speaking in the first person, the author sketches her life from about ages six to fourteen. She presents her life, as she lived it, through a violent time that many readers will remember.<br /><br />In many ways, it's a \\"girl story\\" - not the kind of recollection that boys would typically have, so I'm not the most qualified of readers. It's not a political story, either, even though political action and activism drive the writer's life and threaten it, equally. It's not about religion, even though the little-girl author is profoundly religious up until a rending moment late in the book, and even though religion, her own or other, enters every facet of her life. But this story is not about what it's not.<br /><br />It is a personal story, told by a girl about life from grade-school years into the hard years of a girl's teens. That gives it a disingenuous, honest feeling that stands up to any errors in the author's historical facts. It's also about her parents' personal bravery in raising and teaching a strong young woman, in a world where women are required by law to give up their strength. It's about the here-and-now impact of seeing an uncle's torture scars or seeing a girl friend's bracelet in the bombed ruin of her apartment, attached to some fragment that sanity refuses to name. After a while, even horror simply fails where life continues.<br /><br />I can not draw any conclusion from this work. Nor, I think, can the author, nor does she want me to. There are many pieces here, including echoes of Ann Frank and Will Eisner. Every time I look at the pieces again, they settle into a different shape.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd come back for the second volume. OK, I was wrong. Maybe later, when the author looks back on these early years, they'll make human and humane sense.<br /><br />Maybe not. Maybe it doesn't have to.<br /><br />//wiredweirdpe.    I didn't think I'd come back for the second volume. OK, I was wrong. Maybe later, when the author looks back on these early years, they'll make human and humane sense.     Maybe not. Maybe it doesn't have to.     //wiredweird
B00005JMJG|4.0|The plot is original: Joel finds out that Clementine has erased him from her memory. In revenge, he tries to have her erased from his memory, but then realizes he doesn't want to lose all the memories of her. The movie doesn't follow a chronological sequence; it is one of those movies where everything makes sense at the end. I usually like movies that keep me guessing till the end, but this isn't one of them. I mean, I liked it, but I didn't love it. It's a movie that I admire more than like. <br /> <br />I know people will disagree with me, but one of the reasons for my lukewarm approval of the movie is, simply, it tries too hard to be smart. Don't get me wrong, it is a smart movie with some terrific writing, but as the movie wore on, I sort of lost patience with it. For example, there are many scenes showing Joel and Clementine's relationship that are deliberate placed out of order. For the first hour or so, it worked for me because it was interesting, and I had never seen anything like it. But I felt some scenes just felt out of place...if you can understand the `humiliation' scene, please explain it to me. <br /> <br />Despite my reservations with the plot, I thought the movie was very well-acted. Jim Carrey gives a great, nuanced performance - sad, happy, tired. He looks very weathered in the movie and it works here. Kate Winslet also gives a great performance. Her impulsive, spunky Clementine is the perfect compliment to Carrey's despair. The supporting characters are also fantastic, particularly Tom Wilkinson as the doctor, and Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as his assistants. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst, though; she was irritating. <br /> <br />Don't let my opinions stop you from seeing this movie. It's one of those movies that you like a lot or you like a little. And, to its credit, it's the most original movie so far this year. The most enjoyable? Maybe not.
B00000K0E5|5.0|To be honest, this is my favorite James Bond film ever made! I have seen pretty much all of them, and I have to say, this one beats all the rest. It's classic James Bond, if not with a little more brains than the other ones. The acting is first-rate, and we have several talented actors like Pierce Brosnan, Sean Bean, Alan Cumming, and others. The action is superbly choreographed, and Martin Campbell's directing is excellent. The quips by Bond are as good as ever, and you really enjoy watching him nail the bad guy. I am sad that thsi same director Martin Campbell is one of the people influencing all these new changes in the franchise (Daniel Criag as Bond?), but I still appreciate this film done by him.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I already owned all of the Matrix DVDs, so I bought this primarily for the extra content, the bonus disks. However, what has turned out to be my favorite feature are the commentary tracks provided by a group of movie critics, who by and large seem to truly hate Reloaded and Revolutions. As a fan of those movies, I expected that sitting through the commentaries would be a painful, wince-inducing experience, making me feel shame for being so lame as to actually -like- the second and third parts of the trilogy. But I was wrong. Rather than shed light on any actual major flaws in the movies, instead these guys reveal that they're so willfully ignorant of what the movies were about that they had no chance of enjoying them in the first place. Movie critics; just below amoebas and lawyers on the food chain.<br /><br />Ironically, the \\"philosophers\\" commentaries were harder to sit through. Cornell West's gushing and general hyper-enthusiasm is obnoxious and must only be taken in small doses.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I listend to all the samples of the CD, and I thought the songs was great. My favorite song was Be Yourself. I don't if any of you love watching wrestling as much as I do but on Monday Night RAW the 2005 RAW Diva Search Winner Ashley has Be Yourself as her entrance music. If you do love the song Be Yourself than you should go to WWE.COM and listen to Ashley's entrance music. I give this CD 5 stars.
B000021YQV|5.0|In their second album, System of a Down delivers a hard hitting, completely original and influential masterpiece that is Toxicity. The 4 politically charged metal makers of this new style of metal have really hit the jackpot with this album. There is no mistaking it, this is a band that can only go farther and farther. <br /> <br />First, the main reason why you should like this band is their individuality. Before this CD, I had never heard anything like it. Even how they present some of their politically charged songs like \\"Prison Song\\" and \\"Deer Dance\\" is just amazing because when you think of political metal, you think of Rage Against the Machine and I assure this is nothing like that at all. True, System of a Down is a band all their own. The second reason you should really be into these guys is because they give an unbelievable balance of melody and metal in their music that gives you a fast paced yet eloquent listening enjoyment. <br /> <br />The 2 big songs off this album are \\"Chop Suey!\\", probably one of the weirdest singles on rock radio ever but still an amazing song. And the other would be the album title track \\"Toxicity\\". A lot of people were extremely surprised that these guys got this much support on the radio with this song alone but I think it was for the best because as I remember 5 years ago, the metal on the radio (at least in Minneapolis) was Linkin Park, Saliva and Staind. It was nice to get a change from the ordinary. <br /> <br />Personally, I couldn't find a song on this album I didn't like because even the bizarre lyrical abstracts like \\"Bounce\\" and \\"Psycho\\" at least made me laugh. And then some of the B side songs on this album like \\"Forest\\", \\"Deer Dance\\" and \\"Needles\\" are musical mastery. Seriously, just sampling these guys' music is a great experience. This is totally worth it. Even if you're not into abstract, artistic metal, this is still a great album. 5 star CD!!
B000F48CD8|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this disc based on hearing \\"Steady As She Goes\\" on the radio. I thought it would be a more straightforward Jack White vehicle. My only familiarity with Cincinnati's The Greenhornes (and I'm ashamed of this being a fellow Ohioan) was from the two songs on the \\"Broken Flowers\\" movie soundtrack by Akron native Jim Jarmusch. I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of trippy but rocking, edgy tunes that resulted from this collaboration. It is cool to see/hear Jack as a \\"dude in a band\\" as opposed to part of a color-coordinated, themed duo. I read in MOJO  magazine that Brendan Benson, the main man from The Greenhornes, felt he has been pigeonholed as sounding Beatles-like and that he has struggled to escape this throughout his career; I think we benefit from his struggle to put his own twist on sunny pop as captured in \\"Hands,\\" \\"Intimate Secretary,\\" and \\"Yellow Sun.\\"  The tunes \\"Broken Boy Solder\\" and \\"Store Bought Bones\\" have a more direct, Zep-tinged  JW sound. \\"Together\\" and \\"Call It a Day\\" have gotten under my skin. And \\"Blue Veins\\" MUST be used in an upcoming Jim Jarmusch film; perhaps it was inspired by watching his past or future films or listening to Jarmusch's past soundtrack music choices (I see in the disc booklet the he is listed in the credits). Anyways, I digress. I will be checking out the Greenhornes back catalog. I also think that Jack White is a real talent of this musical era. He produced, arranged and played on Loretta Lynn's wonderful Van Lear Rose on which Patrick Keeler and Jack Lawrence provided the rhythm section; and he contributed to the Cold Mountain soundtrack. I like the risks he takes and look forward to more of his musical adventures. The MOJO article stated that the material for this album was recorded during the summer of 2004 in Benson's Detroit home studio as \\"downtime jams.\\" Since then, they have all relocated to Nashville and we can only hope that the jam sessions continue in their new digs and yieldanother interesting and diverse bunch of tunes like this one. If not, I'm happy with this one-off effort! <br /> <br />
B000059XYL|1.0|Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around.  There is supposedly some kind of moral to this story.  The only moral I can see is ...when you don't have a big enough brain, use your bod to get ahead.  Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever!  (right)  My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv.  Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years;  being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more.  Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either.  It is not a good example for the young women of today.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I've never written a review before but I felt it necessary after reading some of the other views of other listeners. Although I hardly care about what people think of as \\"good music\\" nowadays I felt as if my input would be needed for those true fans of music. First of all, this isnt a review of a Pink Floyd album, nor compared to any likes or dislikes of the band. David Gilmour had created this album for the sole purpose of making music. I know this because of its originality, it's uniqueness. For those of you who compare David Gilmour to Pink Floyd arent really pointing out anything we dont already know. The point is, \\"duh\\" he was a large chunk of what was Floyd, almost 20 yrs ago.  <br />            The album is amazing. From start to finish. It is a mellow album with relaxing melodies, and soaring guitar solos which makes a receipt for a wonderful creation. Of course its not expected for everyone to be in love with this album, but for a fan of music, one who would take the time and listen and try and understand where the artist is coming from, one would find it hard not too say to themselves that it was amazing. If your looking for another floyd album, your not going to find it, most likely because this isnt Pink Floyd, but if your a fan of a man who has created great music for the band and has his own unique style that evolves from time to time, this album is more than worth a listen.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Ron Burgundy has it all - a dream job, a luxurious apartment, a great news team, adoring fans, and an enormous ego.  But, aside from a mangy dog that talks to him and shares his pillow at night, he is all alone.  Then Veronica, a pretty and determined feminist with big dreams, comes along and threatens to take away everything that makes his life so sweet - and possibly make it sweeter. <br /> <br />\\"Anchorman\\" was a good movie.  It was mostly a spoof on love stories and everything relating to the news, but I found it to be amusing and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.  There was definitely some foul language and a few mature parts, hence it's PG-13 rating.  But I liked it.  As I mentioned above, it was just one big, hilarious spoof.
055321277X|3.0|I took Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde out of the library expecting a thick volume to sink my teeth into but instead got a short scary little story. <br />This is definitely worth a read though and I enjoyed it very much.  I can't say much without giving it away but if you liked Frankenstein by Mary Shelley then I recommend this.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|i give this mess two stars for the try at something meaningful here,but they missed the boat! jake gyllenhaal and jamie fox are good but the screenplay is underwritten and the movie is just not up to the task of telling it's first gulf war story. the action is few and far between and what passes as development of the charters is just not worth the time you have to spend watching this foulball movie.
B000002VC3|5.0|This is the second Alan Parsons disc that I purchased after the great TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD album. EYE IN THE SKY comes in a close second to TOAFC. This is an amazingly good album except for the song &quot;Step By Step&quot; which is kind of weak in comparison to the other great songs. I like &quot;Psychobabble&quot;, but it's the next weakest song in my opinion. When you get past those two, the rest of the cd is superb. It kind of sounds like a ADD album because it kind of has a warm analog ambience to it. The cd STEREOTOMY sounded like a DDD recording (not exactly sure if it was) you know because of the razor sharp cymbals and the great focus, but it lacked the warm analog sound picture of EYE IN THE SKY. Two of my three favorite Project songs are on here, and they are &quot;Silence and I&quot; and &quot;Old and Wise&quot;. &quot;Mammagamma&quot; is just about my favorite intrumental in their entire discography. I get chills from the opener and prelude to &quot;Eye In The Sky&quot; the song &quot;Sirius&quot;, then, &quot;Eye In The Sky&quot; is in my top eight or so of Project songs. &quot;You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned&quot; is also one of my favorites and a very catchy tune. Another great song is &quot;Children Of The Moon&quot;. Definitely a topnotched tune. All in all, this is one of my favorite recordings, and I'm including all genres of music. If you're new to the Alan Parsons Project, just sample TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD and EYE IN THE SKY and you will forever be on the Project bandwagon.
B0001932ZA|2.0|the two stars i gave this turkey is for richard dawson as the running man host damon killian,he steals this movie and makes it his. using every gameshow trick he ever had dawson turns killian into the anti-gameshow host as he deals death and prizes out to the masses. richard dawson should have gotten an oscar nod for his funny and scarey turn in this otherwise waste of a movie. \\"let's play the feud,i mean the running man\\"
B000BJS4OY|5.0|How do you top one the records you would take to a desert island.  Remastering helps, a bonus dvd on making the record is fascinating, but ultimately only of value to obsessives like myself.  A decent booklet would be nice, but no the booklet for this package is lame.  Great pictures, but nothing that helps put this disc in context for those who weren't there (like my daughters).  But then you throw in video of a legendary Springsteen show-now we're getting somewhere.  The E Street Band in all their pimp daddy glory playing England, just as they are really finding their voice together.  That's worth the money.<br /><br />An absolute winner, highly recommend just for the added features
B00000IQC8|5.0|Can't wait till I'm old enough to see this.Rated R for extensive use of extremely explicit sex-related diolauge.Canada:14A[Nova Scotia],18A.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is an almost perfect melding of voices and styles.  Knopfler plays beautifully and the songs are great.  The title track and This is us were extensively played for several weeks before the release date by Don Imus so by the time it came out I had to have it.  A worthy follow up to Sailing to Philadelphia and the Dire Straits catalog and again shows Emmylou as one of the best singers on the planet.<br /><br />Highly recommend
B000F3TBIO|5.0|Wow Mike Patton. I've been a Mr. Bungle fan for quite some time, so I admit I am biased to love anything by Mike. This album has texture, and songs that are very interesting. The tonal scape is vast and refined. Fantastic.
B0006J28L4|5.0|This movie gave a great depiction on Malcolm X, an unsung hero of the Civil Rights movement.  Especially with the second disk of the set, it goes through the production of the film where Spike Lee faced difficulties in creating it, specifically with funding.  This movie was a great adaptation of the book, yet I highly recommend reading the book first before watching the film, like most books which became film. <br /> <br />Denzel Washington did an outstanding job playing the role of Malcolm X and should have won an Oscar for it.  You can tell he researched the character and met with family and friends of X and got personal with the depiction when filming. <br /> <br />Great history film.
B00005IC2H|4.0|there are mostly two opinions about this album/artist:<br /><br />1. it's amazing in that out-of-body experience kind of way<br /><br />2. it's dull, pretentious, never gets anywhere<br /><br />and both sides have their points. kind of.<br /><br />no, i do not listen to this album very often. i do not even listen to it with other people, usually. i do yoga to this album. no one should listen to this album expecting some sort of upbeat tempo or something. that would be just ridiculous.<br /><br />but i do think that it is one of the most pure expressions of human emotion i have ever heard. the fact that i don't understand the lyrics just adds to it for me. this album is really something that i seem to feel inside my bones. it's entrancing, unreal -- it inspires me.<br /><br />i think this is an album for practicing yoga, for painting, for replenishing your soul in any way. i think the people who complain about this album simply did not listen to it the right way.
B000002NIW|5.0|I purchased this when it came out and was floored by it.  The lyrics are somewhat fragmented, but the music will creates an atmospheric cloud to get lost in.  I have lost myself many times in the harmonic pulsation of this metal tirade.  Pure dreary bliss.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|This movie has a lot going for it:  a good story, nice cinematography and great sound.  But, the story is poorly told and the characters are never really developed.  I think the movie could have been a lot more.  Instead it is just a long MTV video.  <br /> <br />This DVD is well done.  The surround sound is excellent. It is about the best done of any DVD I have watched. The special features are \\"the making of\\" type.  I'm not really into that.  If you have seen one \\"making of\\" video, you have seen them all.  We all know how blue and green screen works.  We understand animation.  If you are huge movie buff or really love this movie, you will probably get into this. <br /> <br />In spite of what some say, this is your typical sci fi, future society coping after armageddon type movie.  400 years after a virus wipes out most of the earth, the ancestors of the survivors live in tightly controlled society.  People mysteriously disappear and there is a group of rebels fighting for freedom.   <br /> <br />The story has a neat plotline and some interesting twists.  The only problem is that the characters and plotline are poorly realized. So, the twists aren't that shocking and you don't really care that much. <br /> <br />Also, many things happen in the movie that are pointless and don't futher the story.  For instance, Aeon's first assignment, to interrupt communications is completely pointless.  Why is she doing it?  It has no impact on anything.   <br /> <br />This could have been a much better movie with some character and story development.
B000000JO3|5.0|Anyone should be able to understand that Ian was pretty passionate and probably still is about life and society's constraints.  Youthful angst at it's height.  You can really feel his emotion.  And if you must get stoned or @!$#!#$'d up somehew, this music is infectious and grows every listen.  Between this and Damaged by Black Flag, there is no better hardcore in my opinion.  Buy them both if you can.
B00064VR0W|5.0|This show was shot at Royal Albert Hall in the end of 2004 and edited to about 90 minutes of DVD time, leaving 17 songs out of 25 from the original show (plus biography and countdown to the show documentary. There are 12 classics (including \\"Stay with me\\" with Ronnie Wood) and 5 standards from \\"American songbook\\" trilogy (\\"As Times Goes by\\" performed with Chrissie Hynde of Pretenders). All in all, it's a wonderful DVD - great show and excellent quality of audio and video. At 59 Rod is still a great entertainer, and his backing musicians are very good. The audience is just fantastic and is ready to sing along with Rod all the time (sometimes he even has to tell that they can not start to sing before him).  <br />One of the best live DVDs I've ever seen. Highly recommended to all music lovers!
B000001DYY|5.0|This is another one of those albums that boggles my mind in the way it was received. This album is incredible! Every track is great and that's coming from a casual Tears for Fears fan. If you like them at all, make it a point to get this album which incidentally is the first TFF album after Curt Smith left. Get this album, you won't be disappointed.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Get this DVD, find three hours of spare time (some good wine may also come handy), and enjoy the Yes magic: you will be amazed at the quality of this show! <br /> <br />At last the magic and power of Yes performance was caught on DVD with proper quality both of video and audio - the picture and sound are both great, DTS surround track is incredible. <br />I am not going to give you the details - you will see it yourself, here is just my impression of this magnificent show. <br /> <br />The band is at its best - the musicians are enjoying the show, and the orchestra gives the band as good as it gets, really having a good time on stage. The interaction of the band and the orchestra is a creative one; they complement each other giving Yes music another dimension: just check the brilliant performance of my all-time Yes favorites \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" and \\"Close to the Edge\\"!  <br /> <br />Standing ovation of the audience is its way of sincere appreciation of timeless music and unforgettable evening. <br /> <br />This DVD is an exemplary case when everything's in proper place: excellent performance of the band/orchestra and exceptional quality of DVD itself. This is definitely the best Yes DVD so far. <br /> <br />This DVD is a must - you will enjoy the show over and over again!
B00005JOIH|5.0|(EDIT 3/3/15: In regards to the Blu Ray, you get the same extras as you did on the limited edition 2-disc DVD. The picture is literally perfect and the sound is incredible. As great as the film looks, the sound on this disc was dynamite and the real star of the show here. Surrounds are heavily used throughout the film and the low end frequency on certain scenes was off the charts. The scene where Avner is nearly killed by a larger than expected bomb felt like it was going to rupture my subwoofer. In short, if you already have the 2-Disc edition, the Blu Ray is a worthy upgrade and a worthy purchase if you don't already own the film.)<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that I'm not too crazy about the fact that they're charging what is basically a premium price for this two-disc set. I've seen other regularly priced discs with just as many extras, if not more, than this one has so you're probably asking yourself why am I recommending this?<br /><br />The packaging for this disc is a very nice slipcase edition complete with a great 32 page photobook.<br /><br />The 80 minutes or so of featurettes are very informative and cover a lot of what went into making the film, as well as details of the actual events of the '72 Olympics. Spielberg usually has a well put together set of featurettes for his films and this disc is no exception. Don't expect a director's commentary as Spielberg doesn't do them. He is gracious enough to provide an introduction to the film and does talk about it at length in the featurettes so, it's not like he pulls a Wachowski Brothers and absolutely refuses to say anything at all.<br /><br />The disc looks and sounds great and though I would've loved a DTS track, the soundtrack is still thunderous in DD 5.1. In fact, this movie is mainly dialogue driven and is quite low key as a result but the explosions in this movie are downright huge.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I feel like it gets better every time I watch it. This movie definitely is not for everyone due to the amount of violence in it but I consider it to be an amazing, powerful film that was wrongly overlooked last year. If you enjoyed the movie enough to want to learn more about it, I strongly suggest going with the limited edition set.n it but I consider it to be an amazing, powerful film that was wrongly overlooked last year.

B000002U8G|5.0|My pal Leslie Doyle loaned this to me when I was just 16 years old (50 now).  What a mind blow. Like, far out man.  I just picked this up again along with Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.  Meddle finds this band is on to something but it isn't quite yet realized.  One of These Days and Echos are definitely the highpoints, the other tracks are nice acoustic pieces but if you heard them on the radio and didn't know better you would never guess it was Pink Floyd.<br /><br />I do think that Echos owes more than a tip-o-the-hat to Jimi Hendrix's epic 1983, A Merman I Should Turn To Be, which included wind and surf sounds, a dreamy underwater interlude, lots of surreal tape effects, complete with seaguls generated by feedback (Gilmour's seaguls sound very much the same as Jimi's).  Thats not a slam but anyone who's heard 1983... can hear the obvious influence.<br /><br />Still, this is essential listening for anyone interested in this band, especially in tracking their development.
0449002632|4.0|Unlike a previous reveiwer, I would definitely place this novel in the \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" category.  I found each vignette to be captivating and was drawn in completely by both the fictional characters and the historical fact presented along with them.  I appreciated the device the author used in the genetic traits hanging on generation after generation.  It is, of course, not scientific, but paints a literary picture for the reader.   <br /> <br />All in all, I enjoyed this book greatly and will probably keep it as one to read each year (like I do \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\"!)
B00001U0GQ|5.0|I love this film...  I have absolutely no complaints about anything except that I could have watched more; didn't want it to end.  I remember when this film came out, seeing ads on tv about it, but was unable to see it at the theater.  I wish I could have seen this on the big screen because everything about this film is big.  The stunt with Hawkeye (Nathaniel) jumping thru the waterfall to the river below is absolutely fantastic.  Who performed this fabulous stunt???  This is a very moving action film and love story intertwined and they did a great job with it.  I absolutely loved Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe's performances.  There is major, and I do mean major,  chemistry between this couple.    The whole cast was excellent.  You either loved or hated the characters, depending on their behavior in the film, and they all depicted the individual they were playing very well.  The fight scenes are very realistic and I could actually watch them without flinching because even though the fights are brutal, you don't see body parts or blood flying. Also, there is no profanity and you never miss it which would be true in most films if they would just leave it out.  The music, Trevor Jones, and scenery at the Chimney Rock Park, N.C., take you to the place you should be in this film as you watch it.  Very, very well done and I loved every minute. You should definitely try this movie.
0553278398|4.0|This novel has a subtle beginning.  I would take a little to time reading the beginning to absorb Asimov's setting and style here.  The science of psychohistory that laid out the Foundation had to start somewhere, and this is where it starts and with Hari Seldon.  So there's a lot written of Seldon's early life and a lot about different sections of the Galactic Empire capital planet of Trantor.  Seldon is not represented as some sort of superman, but if you've read other books in the Foundation series, as someone to admire, and is seen as a person outside of just psychohistory.  Sort of like seeing the famous photograph of Albert Einstein riding a bicycle.  And as others in the Empire see the potential power of psychohistory, even before Seldon does, thus begins the race to harness that power.  The joy, and the point, in reading this novel is in the knowing the eventual power of psychohistory and thus how it develops.  Seldon has to be persuaded to progress his theory of psychohistory by the other interesting characters in the novel.  Can you imagine, early in the 20th century, having to go \\"come on Albert, will you at least *try* to develop the theory of General Relativity\\".<br /><br />There are two type of readers that would be potentially interested in reading this book for the first time: those that have read the traditional Foundation series and are wondering if they should continue here with this prequel, and those that haven't read the originals and are wondering if they should start here.  For the former, sure with the understanding that Asimov's style will be different 40 years after he wrote the novellas of the original series, and for the former, no, I would start with Asimov's original Foundation trilogy.  His original series is almost essential 40's/50's science fiction, and if one doesn't like that series, one is not going to care about the characters and events in Prelude To Foundation.<br /><br />From the Author's Note and adding Forward The Foundation which was written afterwards (I may have left out a book or two), there are 15 books (a quint-decology?) in Asimov's universe.  They are:<br /><br />1. The Complete Robot (includes every story of I, Robot)<br /><br />2. The Caves of Steel<br /><br />3. The Naked Sun<br /><br />4. The Robots of Dawn<br /><br />5. Robots and Empire<br /><br />6. The Currents of Space<br /><br />7. The Stars, Like Dust--<br /><br />8. Pebble in the Sky<br /><br />9. Prelude to Foundation<br /><br />10. Forward the Foundation<br /><br />11. Foundation<br /><br />12. Foundation and Empire<br /><br />13. Second Foundation<br /><br />14. Foundation's Edge<br /><br />15. Foundation and Earth<br /><br />Books 1 to 5 are Asimov's Robot series, books 6-8 his Empire series, and books 9 to 15 his complete Foundation series.  They were initially separate series, but he used books 5, 9, and 10 to encompass them all into one series.
B00008NG5V|1.0|Ideal for the days when you want to end it all. For when you hear this trite, insipid excrement you'll be desperate to stay alive as Johnson's bland music will surely be playing in the elevator that takes you to the Pit. And for the rest of eternity as you stoke Satan's furnaces. <br /> <br />Don't buy this for your own good! <br /> <br />
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I put the word new in quotations as this band is really a modern version of older bands trademark sounds. I generally dont like bands that sound like other bands on each and every song(stone temple pilots) but these guys pull it off. The songs follow the typical Led Zeppelin/Black Sabbath formula of being riff driven.The album is heavy but the sound is varied enough so it dosnt get tedious. It is good to see a band using the influences of the past to create new music. The lyrics are somewhat challenged and some experiments like the whitestripe sounding apple tree dont work but overall a very good album. Great album to have for the summer.
B00005JOVH|4.0|I liked X-Men, hated X-2.  In my review for X-2 I say I missed good mutants fighting bad mutants.  Be careful what you wish for.  There are so many mutants, and half of them are just green or blue or tattoed.  I knew Magneto, Mystique, Juggernaut, and Multipleman on the Brotherhood side.  The rest of the mutants I have no clue what their names are.  But theres Spike haired man and tattoed women and  wierd haired mutant.  The action is great but why, why kill off a main character off screen!  The only main character that I felt sorry for was Proffesor X.  The only new villains added should have been Juggernaut and Pyro.  And Juggernaut is awesome.  He brings back memories of the best villain(besides Ian Mckellan)in the X-Men franchise.  Yep, its Toad.  Overall not much of a story but good action sequences.  I was expecting more but when Singer left you knew X-Men wasn't going to be the same.
B000EQ5TSI|1.0|This movie was not only stupid, but it also stained the MI series with a huge inconsistant sequal. The storyline is just plain shaky. Tom Cruise was NOT the Ethan hunt that he was in the first one. He turned into some into some guy who laughs at everything, he lost ALL of his charm that he had in the first movie. This was a TERRIBLE MOVIE!!! The characters were so differnet then the first one, and gosh the worst part of this movie was how inconsistant it was from the first one. Only buy this if you absolutly  have to, but let me warn you, it is a WASTE!!!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is by far my favorite album of the year.  Harris and Knopfler are the perfect compliment to each other.  The songs are traditional of both artists however they are so well crafted they never ramble.  Listen for the two best songs on the album, `in my wildest dreams' and `all the roadrunning'  and the lightweight but charming `red stagerwing' and the brooding `donkey town' about a war veteran and his wife in an old mining town.
0399241515|3.0|This series is auesome. This addition...was not my favorite. It has a good storyline, but at the end everything changes. It turns out that his father was really NOT  a assasin, just another spy. I think that it has a VERY shaky storyline. I am sure horowitz could have done better.
B00005JKHP|1.0|In the genre of science fiction/fantasty, two series' have held sway over fans hearts and minds for over 30 years.  The series' are 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek', both epic in scope, and breathtaking in spectacle, yet still world's apart in terms of their approach to the future.  I have already discussed the 'Star Wars' series in previous reviews, so I shall now turn my attention on the other powerhouse series of films under the name 'Star Trek'. <br /> <br />Years before there was ever a 'Star Trek' movie, there was a short lived TV series that aired on cable television for 3 seasons called \\"Star Trek\\".  The premise for the show week in and week out was to follow the continuing voyages of the Federation starship Enterprise and her crew.  Sci-fi fans loved the series, but sadly their love was not enough to keep the series on the air, and it was eventually cancelled.  Years later rumors were circling that another 'Star Trek' TV series was to begin soon, at the time it was to be called \\"Star Trek: Phase 2\\", at various times it was rumored to have the same cast as the original series, and other times it was to be a whole new cast and crew.  But alas, the series was not meant to be, but instead of simply dying out and being cast into the abominable pits of Hollywood Development Hell, the series evolved into what would become the first movie in a long lasting franchise, thus \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" was born. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" takes place quite some time after the final episode of the original 'Star Trek' TV series, the crew of the Enterprise led by Captain James Kirk have parted ways.  Kirk is now an admiral in the Federation, and is preparing to send a newly rejuvenated Enterprise on her maiden voyage out of space dock.  As simple as this task is, it was not meant to go off without a hitch, as the mission is about to begin, a mysterious being known as the V'ger is threatening the Federation's well-being, and that of the entire galaxy.  With new orders and Captain Kirk back on the bridge of the Enterprise, it's time to assemble the old crew back for another mission to boldly go where no man has gone before. <br /> <br />The premise for the movie was interesting enough, and a perfect starting point for people who maybe haven't seen or had any knowledge of the original TV series.  Having a mysterious force that is so powerful threatening the galaxy, requiring the combined skills of the Federation's best starship crew to stop it, seemed like it would make for a most enjoyable movie experience.  However, this movie was not to be all that enjoyable, at least not to me.  I know saying I dislike \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" is borderline blasphemy in some circles, especially amongst the die-hard 'Trekkies', but this movie is absolutely horrible.  Believe me I wanted to like this movie, I realy did, I've been a fan of 'Star Trek' from the TV series \\"Star Trek: TNG\\" all the way through \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\", and all of the movies I had seen were enjoyable (even \\"Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier\\" which was only average), however having never seen the original movie I wanted to see where it all began.  Sadly, I was severely disappointed in the proceedings.  The primary reason for this would have to be the glacier-like slowness of the movie, every scene seemed to drag on forever, and there appeared to be no excitement or joy in the actors performances to even be in this movie.  Whenever there was a chance for some excitement or an action scene, they were so slowly built up that when they occurred I didn't care at all.  I know I'm not that far off base with my analysis for the slowness of the movie, since the director went back and re-edited the film to make it a little tighter in presentation, and even beefed up some of the special effects sequences, though not much.  I will say this, as much as I hated this movie, I did enjoy the fact that each of the main characters had their moment to shine on the screenwhen they were introduced so that the audiences could get reaquianted with their heroes from the TV series, but other than that, there's not much more good things to say about this movie. <br /> <br />With this movie turning out the way it did, I'm surprised that it did that well at the box office, but thank God it did, because the 'Star Trek' movies that followed were excellent for the most part, especially the follow-up film \\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\\".  When all is said and done, I love the 'Star Trek' franchise as a whole, but I can't stand this movie, and will probably never watch it again, even if I'm watching all the movies in order, I will skip this one because it's not really needed.  If you have seen most of the 'Star Trek' movies, except for this one, and are considering buying or renting all of them, I would say you could bypass \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" and you'd be doing yourself a huge favor, but that's just me. <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" is rated PG for minor violence.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Most artist with a blazin' first album suffer from \\"Sophmore Jinx\\" where their second album don't even come close to being a brilliant as the first...well I'm glad to say Miss Keys doesn't suffer from the \\"jinx\\".     The \\"diary\\" is as elegant, soulful, and as good as her first album [[ASIN:B00005JXS6 Songs in A Minor]]. She and her production partner Kerry \\"Krucial\\" Brothers (her partner in KrucialKeys, I'm sure you've heard her say it) have found the right groove for producing great songs. Alicia is definitely in her own groove and that's a good thing where we have all these acts coming out being produced by The Neptunes or Timbaland.    I would tell you what the HOT tracks are, but all the songs fall into one of two catergories HOT or seriously WARM. This looks like another classic for Miss Keys, but of course...she's always been a class by herself.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|Much like most modern action yarns, \\"Sahara\\" hits the screen with a bang.  Its bang, however, takes place in the twilight of the American Civil War as the Confederate ironclad, \\"Texas,\\" escapes an attack.  We blitz forward to modern times and are quickly introduced to Eva Rojas(Penelope Cruz), Dirk Pitt(Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino(Steve Zahn), in that order by way of swift-moving events.  The Zahn introduction segues into a slower atmosphere, as we meet William H. Macey, who plays Admiral Sandecker and the geeky Rudi(Rainn Wilson).  We also take a brief gander at the primary baddies and from there, the adventure takes off again.<br /><br />Pitt is in search of the ironclad \\"Texas,\\" which he, and only he, believes has managed to end up somewhere in Africa.  He coaxes Sandecker into letting him take his private boat to hunt for the ship.  The only catch is that he must bring along Rojas and her companions from W.H.O. looking for a cause and cure for a plague that has stricken Africa.  From this point on, the viewer is fed a steady diet of explosions, old-school cannon fire, gunplay, tricked-out plane wreckage, and African tribesmen.<br /><br />McConaughey has hit a homerun with this flick.  It's the perfect beginning for a new action franchise.  He's almost too clean to play Dirk Pitt, but it's the fact that he IS too clean that makes him perfect for the role.  The character just oozes with the machismo of characters made legendary by the likes of James Cagney.  Even his name, Dirk Pitt, makes one think of a soap opera-like hero who always manages to get away by the skin of his teeth.  Zahn is a complete opposite, making his character the perfect foil to Pitt.  He doesn't look or act like Navy material, but somehow he works perfectly in the role.  His comedic timing throughout the flick is dead on.  Cruz and Macey fill out their respective roles perfectly, with Cruz supplying just enough sexuality and innocence to make Pitt fall for her and Macey sort of bumbling around as the leader of NUMA.  The rest of the cast does a wonderful job, though this is Dirk Pitt's story.<br /><br />As stated before, there are a ton of explosions and plenty of action for any fan of the action genre.  It's pretty much all surface here, but the story is just too fun to turn away.  The comedy relies heavily on the skills of Zahn, but McConaughey doesn't take his character too seriously, reminding us of good ol' Indiana Jones.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with Clive Cussler's work, so I don't know how much this contrasts from the books, but as a stand-alone flick, \\"Sahara\\" is a breath of fresh air amid a ton of stereotypical action tales.  I highly recommend it to fans of action and comedy.  It's a definite purchase.f bumbling around as the leader of NUMA.

B00005JNQS|5.0|I saw this in theatres a year ago and I thought it was the <br />funniest animated film ever! Granted, it isn't a PIXAR film, <br />but it's still a great movie! <br /> <br />Except there was one problem about it. It had a little too much <br />sexual humor. What were 20th CENTURY FOX thinking when they read <br />the script?!? And also how they put some pretty dirty songs in <br />some scenes. Sheesh, I'm 13! In just a few months, 14! Movie <br />people think that just a little bit of dirty stuff would just <br />fly over kid's heads! I think they tried to aim it more to an <br />ADULT audience. <br /> <br />But still, it's a great movie to watch! Very clever!
0451191153|5.0|I started the book a few years ago and put it down because Ayn has a way of being what the editor calls overly descriptive. However, I picked the book back up. Beyond the description, what I found was a pretty good work of literature that entailed many things, a few of which that interested me was the battle between the free-thinker and the thinker that is easily molded by the opinions of others, the difference between a conformist and non-conformist. Although I don't agree with some of the pros, I believe Ayn gives her readers something to think about, especially those that have never been exposed to the idea of architecture (the book focuses on architecture). And without Howard Roark, one of the central characters in the book, the story would have never gained its popularity. Ayn Rand also has a seasoned sense of humor. If you would like to learn more about architecture, read the book. If you would like to get away from fast-moving thriller plots and move over to the literary world, read the book.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Peace Sells... But Who's Buying is the best album from one of, if not the best thrash metal band to date. The only album I might put above this is Slayer's Reign In Blood on the \\"All Time Greatest\\" list. If you are into metal, and don't own Peace Sells by Megadeth, you are a fool. EVERY track on here is AWESOME. This CD is a MUST OWN, no question.
B000A1ENCU|5.0|I would just like to add to all the reviews of Quo Vadis.  Any movie with Peter Ustinov is well worth seeing.  I have watched QV about 30 times and I never tire of it.  Well done in every respect.  I have the Laser Disc and the DVD from Taiwan.  I bought the DVD from ebay for $5, and the quality is excellent, also it is dual layer. <br />I have been making my own DVD's by recording from TCM (using a Digital Recorder via Dish Network). I thought I was the only movie buff who was not satisfied by the Hollywood Machine.  I have made many of the movie DVD's already mentioned.  In particular I would like to ask for \\"Operation Crossbow\\" widescreen please, \\"Fall of the Roman Empire\\", \\"El Cid\\", and all other great movies.  After all so much rubbish has been released, and here I'm talking about quality as well.  Where ever possible I try not to excede 90 minutes on a DVD, certainly when  the source is high quality.  Perhaps we will get improved DVD recorders next?
B0000019PA|5.0|This Album is one of those few that can not only be listened to all the way through without hitting the skip button, but would actually make one get violent if someone else actually did hit the skip button.  It is genreless.  It can't be placed in an era.  It is an island unto itself.  His melodies seem lifted from some country I've never been to and am not allowed to go to.  His lyrics are heartfelt, plain, and strange, very strange.  His melodies are among the most memorable of any I've ever heard, and stick in my brain unannoyingly, and have never left.  \\"I love you Jesus Christ\\" is just something a person can sing in a room and if anyone's ever heard that album, they will either sing it with you or at least smile, but they'll probalby just start singing it with you.  There are bagpipes and a saw for starters on this album.  And given all this, what makes all the strange, unique, and inventive aspects of this album so special is that it all fits, it isn't pretencious experimentalism for the sake of it.  Each note is meant to be there, no fat.  I've put this album up against Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper's, SMiLE, and many other albums I hold in high esteem, and this album still kicks their ass, hands down.  I wish it didn't sometimes, because it means it's still possible to beat the 60's bunch, but it is what it is.  This album is as of yet, the best album I have found. <br />     I know people who hate the sound of Jeff Mangum's voice, and think that the saw is obnoxious, but those are usually people who also like Dave Matthew's Band and probalby think 3 Doors Down is a great band, and that Nickelback is really creative. <br /> <br />This album beats Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper's Loenly Hearts Club Band and SMiLE.  I've tried to like this album less, to beat it up and make it not as good, but it always just comes back with the reality of what it is, the best as of yet created. <br /> <br />It is sad that so few know of this album or give it the credit it deserves.<br /> <br />p.s. Not too many people know this but almost all the employees in the valley of Yosemite National Park can sing on call practically every song off of this album.  If you bring a guitar at night and play Aeroplane over the Sea on the Pizza deck there or in the meadow there or in Boy's Town or in Huff, you'll start to hear voices from the trees surrounding singing all the words with you. <br /> <br />I've never known another album so loved as this one
B000EULJLU|2.0|The following ... are not members of tool... roger waters , david gilmour , nick mason , richard wright .... nin , tool and radiohead are the greatest of modern dark bands , but for fans to push and label them with the king of dark bands only makes it hard on these great acts....  now why did this have to be adam's band ? tool please expand !!!!  5 years ....
B00005JOYA|5.0|i waited four years to see this movie. the writers kept adding more and more from the newer games that were coming out. if you have not played the video games you will not understand the movie. not to give anything away, but at the end, the characters are not dead. play the games and you will understand. Pyramid head was awesome, the patient demons had evolved, but they turned out good just the same. i disliked that they gave a name for the one who summons pyramid head, but what ever it takes for those who don't know that this is a game movie, to understand what is going on. i don't like to spoil the movie for anyone so i will not put explanations of the role each character plays or what they are. so got buy, rent or barrow silent hill 1-4 before you watch so you won't get lost
0688170528|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read.  <br /> <br /> Although The Pact is a work of fiction, the content is so real to me.  I cried throughout the whole book! I connected with the characters so deeply that I thought I knew them or that I was them.  I am in a relationship much like Chris and Emily's and the love they share speaks volumes to me.  I recommened this book for anyone and everyone.   <br /> <br /> <br />It is a totally life-changing experience.
0446577383|3.0|For the most part I found the book to be enjoyable and a good read, however I can't remember his prior books being so overly left-wing and preachy.  Those parts of the story stand out like the worm in an apple. Unfortnately, these propaganda rantings went on for pages and when Balduacci returned to the plot, I couldn't remember what was going on. <br /> <br />I used to enjoy John Grisham books as well but I know longer read them due to his \\"preachy\\" stories. My advice to David is get back to the good stories and leave the politics to the talking heads.
B00026YO36|5.0|Just buy this. This is the best album I've heard in years!!The songs are great, the singing is great, the playing is great. If only there were more artists like Mark and co.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|Nobody was a bigger Pink Floyd fan than me in my teens, but even I have to admit they haven't made a decent album since David Gilmour assumed stewardship of the band in the Eighties.  Gilmour is a very fine guitarist and a much better singer than Roger Waters, but unfortunately he lacks the songwriting goods.  If you can listen to songs like On an Island or Blue without thinking of the word soporific you're probably already asleep.  The Floyd produced some beautiful ambient music, thanks largely to Gilmour, but here it's like chewing on air.   <br /> <br />There's supposed to be some kind of concept here (you know because there's an overture at the start) but stuffed if I know what it is.  Maybe it's 'what I did on my holidays in the Greek Islands'.  There are a couple of Gilmour's incomparably melodic guitar solos, but also some that sound really tired.  The one real gem is Smile, when all the layers of production are stripped back for a lovely acoustic moment.  Elsewhere, where is Waters' misanthropy when you need it?   <br />
B000F1IQN2|5.0|I still get a lump in my throat and my eyes well up when I hear the words of Jim McKay: \\"They're all gone.\\" If we are to believe in a global look then we must be wary of all hate and prejudice, whether in Africa or Eastern Europe, because this is the malignant plant that it breeds.<br /><br />So these 11 runners and hurdlers and wrestlers come to Munich for the Olympiad in 1972, and are murdered. What to do?<br /><br />Golda Meir didn't coin the phrase, but as contrasted with negotiation and talk, she enacts the (what is now) unconventional attitude of 'hunt them, find them, kill them'<br /><br />And so a team led by Eric Bana begins just that, seeking the men responsible for the atrocity. The murderers were PLO, the infamous Black September group, and as history tells us eventually 9 of 11 were assassinated.<br /><br />What Spielberg does is clearly avoided by revenge and retribution authors and directors from \\"Shane\\" onward. In those tales the hero is left lonely but victorious over evil. Here, we get to reflect upon the terrible toll of retribution.<br /><br />To kill someone, even under the aegis of right, costs a lot. Just read the bio of Dick Winters in \\"Beyond Band of Brothers\\" to feel the palpable injury still shouldered by the remaining men of Easy Company, 60 years later.<br /><br />This picture is brilliant. It may not be your cup of tea. But the amazing thing about it is how different people have different reactions. The very actions of Madame Meir may be an affront to you. But I submit that it is not a choice so much between killing and living. It becomes a choice between decision and indecision. She decides to act in a certain way. Avner (Bana) accepts the offer reluctantly, grows into it, finds himself double and triple teamed by it, and eventually suffers the consequences of his decisions.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Avner's team's handler, manipulative as management, seeing different goals, embracing different agendas. You have the feeling that for all of their cunning and intellect, the Israelis are as riddled with conflict between the government, the Mossad and purpose as we are in the United States. This is clearly a keeper and along with Ryan, Schindler, and BOB, Spielberg remains one of the top 3 or 4 directors in America unafraid of embracing the hot potato.<br /><br />After navigating the catacombs of ethical issues, one of the film's characters utters \\"there is no peace at the end of this.\\" True. Is it brilliant? I think so. You may not but you ought to see it.

B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch is the most brilliantly innovative and interesting filmmaker working today, and Mulholland Drive is yet another masterpiece.  Beautiful, ugly, poignant, haunting, hilarious, dark, nightmarish, mesmerizing, thought-provoking, puzzling, confounding.<br /><br />Is it a horror film?  Like all things in the Lynchian universe, the answer is an emphatic: yes and no.<br /><br />What's the story about?  The more proper question is: Is there a story?  Again, there is and there isn't.<br /><br />Mulholland Drive is not so much a story as a series of events, veering off into divergent tangents, surrealistically (but only partially) interconnected, sometimes returning on a Mobius strip in new form, sometimes dropped and forgotten, or lingering on a subconscious level.<br /><br />Welcome to Lynch's dark and beautiful nightmare.  You either love it or hate it.<br /><br />Like Lynch's Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive opens in a hyper-idealized America.  A perky all-American girl (from Canada) with stars in her eyes wins a jitterbug contest -- 1950s kitsch in a contemporary America permeated with anachronistic sensibilities.  She arrives in Los Angeles, seen resplendently through her naive eyes.<br /><br />That's Betty (from Archie comics?) played by Naomi Watts.  In Mulholland Drive, Betty's brunette foil is Rita (Laura Harring).<br /><br />Rita hails from L.A. noir.  A dark femme fatale riding in the back seat of a car, moving languorously, hypnotically, down Mulholland Drive.  Rita's mysterious identity is compounded by her attempted murder.  Then a strikingly brutal (and seemingly arbitrary) incident drastically alters the course of events.<br /><br />As in a nightmare.<br /><br />Lynch is one of the few filmmakers who can pull off such seeming arbitrariness.  His films' narrative subtext, cinematography, art direction, and music create a surreal interconnectedness that fuse events together despite drastic and seemingly arbitrary plot detours.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal too much.  Mulholland Drive should not be spoiled for those who've yet to see it.<br /><br />After driving down Mulholland Drive, Rita has amnesia.  She wanders into Betty's house.  Betty -- who came to Hollywood to be star -- takes Rita under her wing.  Like Nancy Drew, Betty is an innocent drawn to adventure.  Innocent, because no modern day Nancy Drew would last long in the dark and violent world Betty is set to enter (and Rita, re-enter).<br /><br />This is a common Lynchian theme: The innocent who is drawn to dark strangers living corrupt lives under the Disneyfied surface of Americana.  (It is tempting to see Lynch, raised in Montana, as that innocent.)<br /><br />In Mulholland Drive, Lynch (through Betty) pokes underneath Hollywood's glitter.  Naturally, we find lies, corruption, power plays, egos, exploitation.  The pain and heartbreak beneath Hollywood glitter is an old target, extending back to the similarly titled Sunset Boulevard.  Yet remarkably, Lynch breathes starling new vigor into this well-trod tale.<br /><br />The Hollywood power plays involve a dwarf in a red room.  And a cowboy, and much else that remains unexplained.  That is what Hollywood feels like for many.  Actors wondering why they were not chosen.  Directors wondering why they were bumped off a project, or why a project was canceled.<br /><br />Oh yes, Rita has a blue key.  And there is a blue box, reminiscent of Hellraiser's puzzle box.  Mulholland Drive's first hour can best be described as a noir mystery with Lynchian overtones.  That's confusing enough.  But midway through, Rita finds the blue box, and things take a turn into the metaphysical.<br /><br />Remember when in Twin Peaks, Josie's form emerges from the wall at the Great Northern?  And it's ever explained.  No, that's not what happens with Rita's blue box, but it's in the same territory.  Lynch claims to be fascinated by furniture.  And by music, and much else.  His films are less linear stories than surreal journeysthrough his dark fascinations.  The latter half of the film journeys deeper into those fascinations.<br /><br />Mulholland Drive was originally a pilot for an ABC TV series that was never picked up.  It was finished (as a feature film) with French money.  That's one explanation for the sudden turn of events midway through the film.  But once again, Lynch makes it work.<br /><br />There is so much more in this film, but I won't spoil it by recounting the events.<br /><br />Do see this film alone, or at worst, with a mature audience.  I saw it at an IFP/ West screening at the L.A. Film School.  No doubt, the crowd imagined itself hip, trendy, sophisticated.  Yet many laughed at the most inappropriate times.  They laughed at Betty's idealized entry into L.A., upsetting the scene's fine balance.  (As in many horror films, Lynch's films establish a delicate tension between unease and humor -- a tension whose beauty and poignancy and unease can easily be weakened and destroyed by inappropriate laughs.)<br /><br />Yes, Betty is naive, but we are meant to empathize with her vision -- not laugh at her.  Remarkably, the IFP crowd also guffawed at a lesbian scene.  I thought I was surrounded by a crowd of Beavis and Buttheads.<br /><br />Mulholland Drive was nominated for, but did not make, the Preliminary Ballot of the Horror Writers Association's Bram Stoker Awards.  That is no shame on Lynch.  It does disgrace and cheapen the Stokers.<br />______________________<br /><br />PS: While we may all review the final film, and what it means, we should be careful about assuming any \\"intent\\" on Lynch's part.  This is because Mulholland Drive was never intended as a film.  It was initially shot as the pilot to a TV series that wasn't picked up.  So Lynch took the pilot and, with some additional French investment money (from Canal Plus), expanded the pilot into a film.<br /><br />That's why it \\"gets weird\\" later on.  The initial part of the film (the pilot) set up some storylines with specific resolutions in mind.  Then when the series wasn't picked up, an additional hour or so was filmed and edited into the pilot, creating wholly different resolutions (and different storylines) to what had initally been intended.iginally a pilot for an ABC TV series that was never picked up.

B000EWBKM6|1.0|Fans of the first five (or 4 1/2) seasons of Will & Grace who watched in horror as the series plummeted to its death LONG before the finale will not be surprised at the sheer inanity of the last episode. It confirmed what we all knew: The writers ran out of ideas some time ago. To begin with, a 20-year estrangement was just NOT believable, given what we (used to) know about the characters. They should have done an \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\"-type series finale, which didn't try to be \\"cute\\" but instead managed to neatly encapsulate all the major themes of the series without resorting to a bloated hour-long \\"special\\" with flashbacks, flashforwards, dreams, music (much as I enjoy Jack and Karen's abilities in that area) etc etc etc. W&G, sadly, outstayed their welcome. Too bad, because in its prime the show was hilarious.
0345452585|2.0|The author is reusing a similar plot device than in \\"Twisted\\":  a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. That is a poor strategy for a mystery novel, because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes.<br /><br />The narrative in general is not Kellerman at his best, either. The characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do.<br /><br />A small part of the book talks about Brazil, and Kellerman simply invents a couple of Portuguese words making them sound Spanish:  (\\"favilla\\", \\"favillitos\\"). One wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional.<br /><br />In sum, a book carelessly executed.
0345347951|5.0|I remember now why I loved this book. It seems like a typical science-fiction book fromt the 50s - you know space-ships arriving from another planet, Overlords demanding that the human race live peacefully, yada, yada, yada. It could easily be another telling of the movie \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\\" However, it is much more than that. Keep reading until the end, and you'll know what I mean.
B000002BBY|5.0|Obviously one of the 90's best due to the singles `Wonderwall' and `Champagne Supernova,' but the rest of the album oft goes overlooked, especially by American listeners.  Indeed, these singles along with `Don't Look Back In Anger' and `Some Might Say' reveal the albums highest points, but too many non-believers nowadays just download the absolute necessities and forget about the songs that make Morning Glory? the landmark album of the mid-Nineties.  Just as essential are `Hey Now!,' a staggering climactic anthem, and `She's Electric,' a defiant jokester hidden amongst the superpowers.  Also, we have the `Cast No Shadow' super-ballad that has grown on the public with time,  becoming one of the albums staple tracks.  Many Brit-pop groups, such as Coldplay and  The Verve, ripped-off this song on several occasions--half the material on Parachutes sounds strikingly similar to this song and to `High and Dry' off The Bends.  Round all this out with the Definitely Maybe outtake `Hello' and the much underrated title track.  Given the fact that its debuting predecessor is just as superb (if not better), (WTS) MG? makes it easy to see why Oasis became the 90's premier Easy Listening group.  Second only to The Bends for my best of '95, one of the best years for alternative music in the last twenty (Bends, MG?, Mellon Collie, Collective Soul, One Hot Minute, Adrenaline, AIC, ect.).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Because of the Movie Serenity (which I saw for the first time in late 2005), I purchased the Firefly DVD set (which I saw for the first time in May 2006). The script and idea for the entire show was well written. Character development was excellent as well! <br /> <br />It is unfortuante that FOX canceled the series because I can see the show as having a lot of potential. If there is a rainy day, watch the Firefly Series and Serenity. Most individuals will throughly enjoy it because there are comedic and heartful moments. After you watch it, I think you'd wish that there was a second season of Firefly or another movie in the works.
B00000JQFM|1.0|A true sell-out embarrassment.  I was shocked when I got this and slammed it in my player.  Absolutely terrible - and this after Mark & Brian's glowing interview on 95.5 KLOS (Los Angeles) with Joe Satriani playing live.  Jumped on my keyboard and ordered it immediately.  Man, what a let down.
B000FQJAIM|5.0|At the time of this writing, all I read here are reviews by technocrats complaining about the format and the transfer and the quality they haven't seen yet.    Not the point!  The point is Lucas is releasing the original theatrical release.  The poor transfer is a kick at the fans, sure.  But how bitter is the taste in his mouth at this release?  This is a major victory!  Savor it.    First, the quality of an average modern TV set is superior to that of the theater in which I first learned of the new hope for the rebellion.  The quality of my current 19\\" set will surely be inadequate to the quality this upcoming transfer.  Lucas' last attempt to pee on the fans misses me entirely.  I win.  I get the original release and at the same quality.    Second, if you boycott this release, Lucas wins.  He gets to say, \\"See: despite the petitions and complaints, there were no great masses yearning to buy the original release.  These complainers will never be happy, so why bother to appease peasants?\\"  (sound of breathing apparatus here)  \\"It's not about what the fan wants.  It's about my vision,\\" says the Emperor.    Sure, start building a pyre when Lucas shows complete disregard for the fans.  Just hold on to the matches for a little longer when he goes and meets us half-way like this.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I'm not a huge John Mayer fan.  Sure, I've heard a few of his tunes but I never really bothered to pay attention to all of the hoopla.  But there is a hoopla surrounding this guy, both positive and negative. <br /> <br />I bought this record on a total impulse after hearing he was releasing a \\"blues\\" effort with a stripped down, back to basics trio.  I am both a big blues and rock fan, so I figured it would be worth a try.  I guess I'm a little indifferent about it because I had no expectations for it.  Since I didn't have many expectations, I was able to listen past the obvious shortcomings and just enjoy it for what it is:  An attempt of adult contemporary pop/rock crossed over into a bluesy rock.   <br /> <br />Mission accomplished.  Sure, his voice may never sound more than a frog with a cold and his guitar chops, which are impressive, may not compare to SRV, but then again, what does?   Blues purists, if there are still any left, may scoff at this attempt but there are many alternatives for the blues purists... like a pure traditional blues record. <br /> <br />Speaking of which, I don't get the whole comparison to SRV anyway, Mayer's style on this record reminds me more like Eric Clapton mixed with a little BB King and Jimmy Hendrix...?  I don't know, Mayer seems more controlled and reserved than SRV ever was. <br /> <br />But all and all, I'm able to enjoy this disc, and look past the negatives which is odd for me because I'm usually the guy that endlessly analysis music and movies.  I don't know, maybe I'm getting soft...  I personally like \\"Good Love Is On The Way\\" and \\"Try\\". <br />
B000EPR7NE|4.0|Listening to \\"Chevaliers De Sangreal\\" on this gem by Hans Zimmer I am inspired to comment on the transcendence of music. The film may fade in our collective memory, but this music will outlive it. I am delighted that, amidst controversy, there is felt the healing power of good music. A solid buy: you will not be disappointed!

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The 4-Disc Directors Cut version of Kingdom of Heaven is so much richer and textured than the original theatrical version that it is now in the Lawrence of Arabia catagory. It's so much more an epic tale now, more powerful, more tearjerking, far more thought provoking and something I'm sure the cast and director Scott wished for to begin with. Alas, in most cases, it's economics. 3 hour plus films are rare in theatre's...yet it was a terrible crime to cut this one down. <br /> <br />  See it as it was intended...and let us hope for another Scott version of the Crusades. <br /> <br />  Mr Scott...how about the Northern Crusades? Alexander Nevskii etc? Huh, huh!!! <br /> <br />  Fantastic film here, see it!

0714844543|5.0|Martin Parr is one of the great documentary photographers of Britain and this book is a prime example of his talent in the field. This book is a wonderful collection of the quirks and eccentricities of the British. No subject is overlooked as Parr covers food, dress, interior design and gardens, pomp and circumstance and Brits at the seaside. It's a view of England not seen by most tourists which makes it all the more relevant for foreign audiences. Browsing through the book one can see several cultural similarities like the picture of a winning dessert at a district garden society show, or people talking on their mobile phones.  <br /> <br />If you're a bit of an anglophile or simply enjoy good photography, this book won't disappoint. I bought this book at the Tate Modern after having seen several of the photos in various galleries, and find it inspiring to aspiring photographers like myself. <br />
1416524800|4.0|Deception Point by Dan Brown is a fast paced easy read that keeps the reader page turning until the very end.<br /><br /> Rachel Sexton is a worker in the White House, when one day she is pulled from her every day routine to be flown by order of the President to the an unknown location somewhere on a polar ice cap.  She is then told something that would change the world as we know it.  Proof that there is life on other planets.  Locked in what appears to be space rock there is fossils of creatures not found on earth.  After Rachel is asked to present this information to the White House staff she soon finds out that it is not as true as it seamed to be.  She is now on a chase against NASA to get the truth back to the people.  All the while her father Senator Sexton is working to ruin the President.<br /><br /> This book is a very good read and I would definitely recommend it to any one who enjoys an exciting read.  This is one of my favorite of Dan Brown books.
0618477942|5.0|While I've been aware of and have sporadically read Alison Bechdel's DYKES... work over the years, I came to FUN HOME as a fan of graphic novels in general, with Art Speigelman's MAUS books being my own gold standard.  I suspect it's merely a coincidence that both are father-child memoirs, but after reading FUN HOME, I could also make the case for it being no coincidence at all.  FUN HOME tells a deep and touching story in a magnificent way.  Bechdel gives you up front what appear to be basic facts about her history, but then she circles back over those facts as the story unfolds; you read the facts a second or third time with a slightly different context and those facts take on a richer meaning, or they illuminate the story in a new light; sometimes, they make you flip back to the first time she told them, so you can compare and ponder.  You gradually find yourself deep in the weeds with these facts, and I mean that in a good way.  You think about the pieces and parts of her father's story, and you wonder which angle is the truest one.  Did he, or didn't he?  I'm not sure I'm sure. <br /> <br />Bechdel parallels the mysteries of her father's story with her personal history of coming out; this, too, is wonderfully revealed in all its confusions and complexities. <br /> <br />Last, but not at all least, consider the illustrations, which are divine.  Not only do they draw you into them on their face value as graceful depictions of the story she's telling, but they are full of interesting visual clues to the plots as they unfold.  I can't wait to go back and reread this book, looking carefully for the references to the coming actions or occurrences.  The illustrations also contain lots of cultural touchstones, product logos and the like, which give them yet another element of fun. <br /> <br />This book is elegant, both humorous and poignant, and quite a revelation.   <br />
0887306667|1.0|<br />     A delusion does not stop to be a delusion simply because <br />     the majority share it. <br />             Leo Tolstoy <br /> <br />If this text were written by a student, it would be pooh-poohed. However... most of reviewers here gave it five stars. Why? There is the so-called Blatant Nonsense Effect: if they read a blatant nonsense produced by an authority, many will believe it, especially those with herd instincts. <br /> <br />Marketing alchemists are in quest for \\"laws.\\" Theodore Levitt: \\"The problem with the marketing con-cept is a persistent tendency toward rigidity. It get dogmatized.  There is not, and cannot be, any rigid and lasting interpretation of what the marketing concept means.\\" But nobody takes heed of that. <br />  <br />Marketing situations are subject to a zillion of circumstances - precisely what make \\"a rigid dogmatiza-tion\\" a folly. Also, any result in business is an outcome of joint efforts of many departments. <br /> <br />NO PROOFS - Messrs Ries & Trout prove nothing and do not delineate validity ranges for their \\"wis-doms.\\" <br /> <br />EXAMPLES - In the ocean of marketing situations you can find examples of whatever, including mu-tually exclusive ones. <br /> <br />IMMUTABILITY - The authors do not know the meaning of \\"immutable.\\" Physics laws are immuta-ble because they work without exceptions.  The\\" 22 immutable laws\\" are rather exceptions. The \\"im-mutabilis\\" epidemic is now raging. <br /> <br />READERSHIP - Who is the target readership of the book? Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Harley-Davidson, and a score of other grandees; or millions of SMEs that manufacture useful mundane products? Looks like grandees. <br /> <br />A CLIENT'S MIND - The authors admit that marketing is a game occurring in the mind of a Client. But they provide ample evidence of being absolutely disinterested in this game. <br />So, they overlook the fact that today's Clients are indifferent, cynical, overwhelmed with proposals in any product category, sick of advertising, and armed with the Internet. Clients have scarce personal re-sources: time, attention, memory, interestedness, desire to strain themselves, etc. Are they willing to spend them on trade names? Sometimes yes; mostly not. <br />That's harsh reality. Most of marketing texts ignore it.  <br />SOPHOMORIC REASONING - \\"There are laws of nature, so why shouldn't there be LAWS OF MARKETING?\\" - That's logic for you! <br /> <br />FALLACIES and BANALITIES - The book is a collection of easily refuted fallacies and unnecessary banalities. <br /> <br />The FALLACIES: <br />1. LEADERSHIP - \\"It's better to be first than it is to be better.\\" <br />How do the authors define \\"first\\"? By market share, profits, capitalization, or whatever? A company with the largest share may be not the most profitable. <br />\\"Get into the mind first\\" - walk out of your ivory tower and poll whether people know \\"firsts,\\" etc. One may know the names of a dozen of non-marketing \\"firsts.\\" But can this idea be mechanistically translated to categories? <br />The \\"law\\" suggests that (1) you should not convince prospects; (2) you should not strive to improve your products; (3) ALL the vendors minus one (first) in a category pursue faulty marketing strategies. <br />An ocean of firms fare well without creating a category, many category creators go belly up. Creating a category and \\"getting into the mind\\" are uncorrelated things. <br />\\"You should always try to select a name that can work generically.\\" -  Ironically, Ries in his \\"22 Im-mutable Laws of Branding\\" says exactly the opposite. <br />Guys, will you please settle this round the corner. If, of course, you respect the readership. And is you do not want to make fools of yourself. <br /> <br />3. MIND - \\"It is better to be first in the mind than first in the marketplace.\\" <br />Well, if there is a place available in that mind! <br />Law 1 says it is better to be first than it is to be better.  Law 3 says there is something better still. <br /> <br />4. PERCEPTION - \\"Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of perceptions.\\" <br />A Client has no perceptions about a sea of products. How is he supposed to purchase them? <br /> <br />5. FOCUS - \\"The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect's mind.\\" <br />and <br />6. EXCLUSIVITY - \\"Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect's mind.\\" <br />Go out and ask people in the street what \\"words\\" are owned by thousands of firms. <br /> <br />14. ATTRIBUTES - \\"For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.\\" <br />Nonsense. Suppose I use the attribute \\"good.\\" Will the opposite, i.e., \\"bad,\\" be more effective? <br /> <br />7. LADDER - \\"The strategy to use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder.\\" <br />What \\"strategies\\" are recommended for each rung? <br />The authors allege that each rung has twice the market share of the rung below it. Much data refute this! <br /> <br />8. DUALITY - \\"In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race.\\" <br />In rare occasions, e.g., in popular software, this may be the case, but there are thousands of prosperous many-horse lines of business: beverages, sportswear, construction, oil, etc. <br /> <br />9. OPPOSITE - \\"If you're shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader.\\" <br />\\"If the leader is STRONG, #2 can occupy his place.\\" Well, and if the leader is WEAK? What is a claimant supposed to do? <br />Not a single example of something \\"opposite.\\" <br /> <br />11. PERSPECTIVE - \\"Marketing effects take place over an extended period of time.\\" <br />and <br />21.

B00007BKVC|5.0|People, I ordered this movie awhile back, and got 2 copies. The latter for the special effects, for the interviews, etc. That was great. Its my ALL TIME FAVE AND I MEAN THIS. I'm a huge huge proponent of helping women who suffer, who do things in self defense, to survive. I loved the actors, geena and susan, and the MUSIC, by Hans Zimmer, every morsal of this movie is my soul. I do not hate men. I am simply, one who loves this movie and have ever since it came out, and even moreso, over time, hence, the late review. <br />So, I am biased, a bit.. but that's just me. As a western girl who loves the road, and travel, and the southwest this appealed to me all the more. As a woman who is of that genertion, and one who challenges things, and defies things, and lives in denim, this is me, as well. We usually love, what we are about, but aside from all of this, its about women taking their lives and livng by the laws they believe in,and that fierocity, and I do love that, but thats my quirk. And, knowing what Susan Sarandon feels politically is in harmony with me too, and is some years later, but.. hey.. that's just me.... here out in california.. and I 'll probably expect that the majority reading this, will not agree.. but thats ok too.
B000002GB9|4.0|I very much think of The Grand Illusion as The Dark Side of the Moon of Styx, mainly because this is the album that finally launched the band in to superstardom, just like the Pink Floyd album mentioned. Styx had four albums released between 1972 and 1974 on Wooden Nickel with their only real success being \\"Lady\\" off the Styx II (1973) album but was not a hit until about a year and a half later. Then comes their deal with A&M with better albums and thereby better selling albums. First comes Equinox (one of my favorites from Styx, period), then John Curulewski abruptly leaves, comes Tommy Shaw, then the next year (1976) comes Crystal Ball, in which the title track (completely penned by Tommy Shaw) is the only cut that receives radio airplay to this day. Still not a bad album, but a notch below Equinox.    Then comes The Grand Illusion, and for a publicity stunt, they released the album on July 7, 1977, or 7/7/77 if using the numerical calendar. Another reason I call this album The Dark Side of the Moon of Styx is some of the music had received too much radio overplay, and the reason for the four star ratings. None of the album is bad, and had I not been overexposed to three of the songs from FM radio, I'd give it a five star rating. The album seems to be a concept criticizing the consumer mindset of America, although this was 1977, and a store like Wal-Mart at that time was a regional store and not the national icon it became starting in the 1990s, but it looked like Styx was seeing it in the air. The title track is the opening cut, from Dennis DeYoung, and the criticisms of the American consumer mindset come clear in the lyrics, and this was an FM staple. The next cut is another FM staple, Tommy Shaw's \\"Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)\\", it's a rather acoustic number, but has extended progressive passages and synth solos from Dennis DeYoung. Tommy Shaw gives us yet another cut, \\"Superstars\\", it's much more pop-oriented. Of course it's the next song that peoplemost associate this album and Styx in general with: Dennis DeYoung's epic \\"Come Sail Away\\". This is perhaps the one song that Styx detractors would use as fuel in the fire for their dislike of the band. Regardless, it's a huge staple of FM radio, and FM radio wouldn't be FM radio if this song wasn't played (as well as stuff like \\"Cold as Ice\\" and \\"Hot Blooded\\" from Foreigner, \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" and \\"Dust in the Wind\\" from Kansas, \\"More Than a Feeling\\" from Boston, etc.). The song starts off as a piano ballad, but then the band gets rocking, and I really love that spacy synth solo. This song was later made fun of on South Park with Eric Cartman singing it, he's no Dennis DeYoung, but of course, that's the point. It's still an excellent song, although I thought the one DeYoung composition that started soft and rocked hard at the end that I thought was better was \\"Suite Madame Blue\\" off Equinox. James Young, always delivering a hard rocker gives us \\"Miss America\\", apparently a criticism of the Miss America pageant, and how the media and culture thinks women should look like. Tommy Shaw's \\"Man in the Wilderness\\" is perhaps one of the better cuts, for one thing, doesn't get played to death on the radio. Often Tommy Shaw gets dismissed as a pretty boy, but his music and songwriting has enough substance to get over his image, and this song, and so many of his others (like the title track from Crystal Ball) proves. Dennis DeYoung gives us the more proggy \\"Castle Walls\\", full of changes in the music, including synth solos. \\"The Grand Finale\\" is basically a short, variant of the title track, this time with spoken dialog, as well as some singing from Dennis DeYoung.    The Grand Illusion certainly helped launch Styx in to superstardom, there's no getting around that. Personally I find the album a tad overrated (by Styx fans), but it's still quite good, I prefer albums like Equinox or the one that came after with Pieces of Eight.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Simply put, this movie is mesmerizing. I'm sure you have read about the plot from other reviews so I will spare you the details. Basically this movie is unlike anything I have ever seen in a movie. I have seen reviews that compare it to other teen horror/drama movies such as final destination. Don't be fooled by these reviews, nothing you have ever seen is like Donnie Darko. To compare it to other movies is unfair. It's complexity is mind bending and leaves you wondering what could possibly explain what happened. After watching it multiple times I have given up trying to explain it with rationality and simply excepted that it is meant to be a mystery that is meant to be interpreted how you see it. I do not think there is a single explanation that sums up all that you see. The story gives you just enough to make you think you know what is happening until the ending which sends your mind racing back wondering what you just witnessed. The performances by the entire cast are exceptional. Never once will you watch this movie thinking about the actors. You are convinced by their portrayals of the charcters they represent, drawn into the movie and their environment. In summary Donnie Darko does something that I think all great movies do. It removes you from reality and transports you to a different place for an experience that you will never forget.
0312330537|3.0|Although the plot is interesting and the writing at least partially evocative enough to compel most readers, this is a novel with serious flaws and it doesn't look like the reviewers are going to tackle them.   <br /> <br />Our protagonist (the author) is a selfish, thrillseeking jerk.  His life tries to smack sense into him with every turn, but he NEVER LEARNS anything.  Talk about frustrating to the reader; by midway you want to choke the guy.  At that point you see the same elements repeating themselves ad nauseum.  No such thing as a transformation or maturation. <br /> <br />On top of that, the writing is flabby beyond belief.  GDR repeats himself, his actions, ideas, and even turns of phrase often enough to become irritating.  One comes to wonder, how did he manage to get this published without an editor?   <br /> <br />My last beef is the author's blatant cliffhanger.  After 1000 pages of this we'd hope there's at least a payoff, but there he goes riding off into the sunset of preplanned sequel #1.  I wonder how many he has planned.  Guess I'll never know. <br /> <br />All this said, it'll probably make a great series of movies starring Johnny Depp.  And to be fair, it could've been a great novel if it had been compressed to about a third of its length and a maturation or two.  GDR, grow up.
0385495323|5.0|This book is a wonderful blend of technical writing with allied history, story telling and myth. The author traces the evolution of code making and code breaking from historical times with interesting stories regarding their development and usage and the great minds who were behind the codes.  <br /> <br />The author has a flair of explaining technical stuff to lay people. It was a pleasure to read through the technical details of codes right from the Vignerre cipher right upto RSA. There is even a chapter on decryption of Egyptian hieroglyphics and other lost languages, even though technically they are not codes (since they were not used to hide information). I loved the description of the German code machine used in WW2 and how it was broken, quite ingeniously, by Polish and British cryptoanalysts. There are even some exercises for budding cryptoanalysts. <br /> <br />In summary, this book gets a wholehearted thumbs up and I now plan to read other books of the same author.

B000EMGAOY|4.0|As a Red Hot Chili Peppers album it is a solid effort. It incorporates some of the \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" and Frusciante is the absolute standout musician here. Kiedis delivers a lot of good melodies as well as more funk stuff. There is nothing wrong with this album...and it is surely likely to please fans, but ore generally speaking after overheard \\"BSSM\\" and \\"Californication\\" and after overplayed singles on the radio, it is unfortunate that such a good album makes the Red Hot Chili Peppers sound like the least original band in the world, as Stadium Arcadium does not offer anything you would not expect....  It seems they wanted people to see this as their \\"white album\\". It might be a solid effort but it is by no means a masterpiece.
0767020308|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie production of Emma.  It is very well cast--I especially liked Kate Beckinsdale as Emma, Lucy Robinson as Mrs. Elton, and  Samantha Morton as Harriet Smith.  Most importantly, to Austen fans, this excellent adaptation is both entertaining to watch and true to the book.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|This movie is simply terrible. It's not like I'm homophobic or anything, I'm actually gay, but this movie just promotes stereotypes and I resent the favorable dipiction of the immature, immoral, and idiotic \\"la vie boheme.\\" On top of all that, from a stylistic point of view, the plot was just absurd, the characters were intensely unlikeable and unsympathetic (I absolutely DETESTED every single one of them, Angel especially), the songs' melodies were grating, and the lyrics were just plain stupid. People in the theater actually laughed at parts that were supposed to be serious because the movie was that aweful. In short, avoid at all costs.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I can't explain anything. Just listen to it. Preferrably VERY LOUDLY. This album makes me feel like I was in my early twenties again. Eddie and Co. have insured Rock and Punk are etched in stone for the 21st century. Pearl Jam fans will only love them more... non-fans will become fans. This album rocks. Thank you Pearl Jam!
B0002DB52M|4.0|Q: Can an actress with a face paralyzed by botox injections still give a good performance?<br /><br />A: Sometimes.<br /><br />Kidman delivers a perfectly understated performance which matches the fact that her character is in shock for a good portion of the film. When she is given a chance to revenge herself on the \\"good intentioned\\" citizens who have tormented her, her lack of animation makes the final scene all the more chilling.<br /><br />Von Trier takes his minimalist philosophy to a new extreme with Dogville's set design. The story is enacted on a soundstage consisting of outlines drawn on the ground to indicate buildings and stenciled labels indicating \\"Gooseberry Bush\\" or other objects. To me this is a brilliant use of foreshadowing in cinema as it reminds one of a crime scene on some unconscious level.<br /><br />At first the set is jarring and the movie a slow starter. There was a point where I said to myself: \\"Do I really want to sit through three hours of this?\\" I'm glad I stuck it out. The story is engrossing once your mind adapts itself to the unconventional visuals. This film proves the gestalt theory perfectly.<br /><br />A lot of critics have blasted this movie as \\"Anti-American.\\" I feel this is a really contrived controversy as the film could just as easily have been set in other locales. The story is a metaphor that relates how idealism crumbles in the face of self interest. The dark side of human nature is present wherever humans are present, America or elsewhere.

0553278223|5.0|It takes a couple of chapters to start getting into this book, but I was hooked by Chapter 5. <br /> <br />Bradbury describes an environment that transforms the people who settle it.  Bradbury's Mars serves as a frontier for an Earth on the brink of Armageddon.  The people who settle Mars come for different reasons, but all are changed by the endless landscape of sand, ruined cities and canals. <br /> <br />The flow of the book is disjointed, it leaves the impression that it was originally written in installments for different magazines.  Bradbury only hints at the rich Martian civilization that once flourished on the planet. <br /> <br />A larger subject is the state of humanity that attempts to conquer the planet.  Bradbury offers a scathing criticism of people who are motivated by conquest or commerce to tame Mars.  The Chapter on the \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\" was brilliant and thoroughly entertaining.  Public officials and latter-day inquisitors get their just desserts after being lured into an irresistable trap.  I savored every sentence of this chapter, and thought of a few people I know who I would love to invite to a modern House of Usher. <br /> <br />This is a book that will stand the test of time and grow beyond being a science fiction classic.

B000002LBH|5.0|I am a fan of hardcore punk rock, and when i say that this is one of my favorite albums of all time, people do not understand.  I first heard this album about 3 1/2 years ago and i instantly fell in love with Morissey's amazing voice and song writing abilities.  If you are a fan of music in general, please take the time and listen.  Even if you are not a fan of contemporary 80's rock.  Listen, because this album can open up new doors, I know it did for me.
B00065MDS6|2.0|If you're not familiar with King Crimson and are looking for a good place to start, this is definitely not it.  I'd suggest looking elsewhere, perhaps their debut \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" for their early works, Larks' Tongues in Aspic for the '70s, or Discipline for the '80s.  Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br />I've owned all of King Crimson's catalogue from the '60s through the '80s as long as I can remember.  Lizard is the one that never truly struck a chord with me.  It's not that I disliked it.  I enjoy everything they did through the '80s and even the '90s.  The problem with Lizard, though, is that it's just too scattered.  There is no cohesive theme, and most of the music just sort of ambles on.  Before you know it, it's over, and you've already forgotten what you heard. <br /> <br />If you like this sort of jazz/classical/progressive fusion that Fripp concocted during this period, I would absolutely steer you away from Lizard directly to their next release, \\"Islands\\", which is incredible. <br /> <br />This record is most definitely for those among us who are King Crimson completists.  If that's your goal, by all means go out and pick this up.  Otherwise, I'd pick up just about anything else by Crimson first.
0793518326|5.0|Japanese scientists got together to make ammends for placing explosive detonators at the bottom of \\"Lake Loch Ness\\" to harrass Nessie (our Underwater Ally) by creating this book.    This book is a complete transcription for all instruments of every song that the Beatles have recorded. I'll start with the cons.    The Cons:     -There are a few errors in here like a few wrong chords.  In fact a friend of mine who knows George Martin asked him to sign it and before he did he circled them in red pen.    -The print is small and you may want to use a photocopier and enlarge the font from time to time    -This does not cover songs written for other bands during the Beatle era like \\"World Without Love\\" by Peter and Gordon, \\"Ferry Across the Mersey\\" or \\"Come and Get It\\" by Badfinger which was actually recorded by the Beatles and released on Anthology 3 I believe.    The Pros:    -This is the most accurate and comprehensive transcription of the Beatles masterpieces- I refer to it as the Beatle Bible.  This one pro outweighs all of the cons and makes this a MUST HAVE for EVERY Beatle fan who plays an instrument!!!  I hope they do the same thing for the Beach Boys catalog!!!
B0000634EV|5.0|The mighty metal supergroup Down created a monster with their debut 'NOLA', a fine tour-de-force of gigantic riffing and Phil Anselmo's raspy vocals. With Down II, the group stick to what they do best, as Phil sings in 'The Man That Follows Hell' - 'I do one thing, I do it well'. And what they do is create monstrous metal anthems full of fat, juicy riffs, harsh vocals and a hell of a lot of attitude.<br /><br />Combining members of notorious metal acts such as Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar and Eyehategod, Down are naturally mean, dirty and ultimately heavy. Opener 'Lysergik Funeral Procession' sets the mood perfectly with its big chunky riffs and angsty mind-set, with Phil snarling 'now I'm so damn mad'.<br /><br />The album has its share of classic Down style tunes, which is a funny thing when you consider they've only made two albums to date. But nonetheless they certainly have their own style, epitomised by the riff-onslaughts of 'There's Something On My Side', 'The Man That Follows Hell', 'Beautifully Depressed' and 'Ghosts Along the Mississippi', the latter having one of the best adrenaline rushing, fist pumping riffs any of the band members have ever knocked out.<br /><br />'New Orleans Is A Dying Whore' is another straight-up brutal Down number, evolving around two main riffs, the first is thick, slow and punishing, the second is equally punishing, just faster and like a big heady rush. Those who enjoy their metal with heavy yet sophisticated guitar/drum writing will enjoy these songs, the last of which is found in 'The Seed', and Down aren't hiding their love for the riff here, it opens with a kind of desperate groan of 'the power of the riff compels me', as if being said on a death bed. Yes, these guys die by their music.<br /><br />Down II has its more experimental side, something the band didn't really stretch past the ballads 'Jail' and 'Stone The Crow' from their debut. There are a few slower ballads on this album, the best of which is 'Learn From This Mistake', a swansong for addicts everywhere with touching lyrics from Phil and some stylish, patient guitar playing from the guys. You just wait for Pepper Keenan to think, 'Argh, f*ck it' and burst into a riffing flames. But it never happens, and the song succeeds as a mellower touch. `Stained Glass Cross' deserves mention for its difference, standing out in the album as rather, well, out of place. But nonetheless I enjoy it. Starting out slow and gloomy it takes a right angle turn to a bouncy, jingly, catchy little number. Unusual, but like the more experimental 'Stone The Crow' from 'NOLA', it works.<br /><br />Down's second album is an instant metal classic in my opinion. Slightly more padded out than 'NOLA', and probably more consistent, it's a step up. Great musicianship from a supergroup that actually works. Go buy if you're a fan of any of the member's other bands, or if you cimply enjoy a nice slab of old-style metal.icts everywhere with touching lyrics from Phil and some stylish, patient guitar playing from the guys.

0156027321|5.0|I have to resist a snide snicker when I read many of the reviews on here for this book... Myriad folks seemed to have completely missed the point. Yes, there is a story in the book about a boy lost at sea with a ferocious predator. No, that is not the crux of the Life of Pi. Or at least not the predator you are focusing on.<br /><br />Read it again. And again. And again. (I certainly will) Perhaps you will eventually stumble across the truth herein, which I devoured: this is one of the most brutal, absurd, and truly poignant treatises on the enduring nature of faith and the battle for the survival, not of life, but of the human soul, surpassing all obstacles, which I have read to date.<br /><br />This book touched me deeply. Thank you, Yann Martel, for contributing this book to the world.
B000003TA4|5.0|Hello, I would just like to say that I have been listening to Nirvana all my life, and I love them. I also love this cd...and everything on it, I can listen to it from begining to ending without getting bored or changing the song...i especially love the sone \\"Lounge Act\\" and the CD's art work...good job Cobain.     People...who shouldn't actually be called people like to put down this work of art, this master piece of music...and why because they say that Nirvana ruined Metal...what the hell? Did you guys know that Nirvana grew up on KISS and Black Sabbath... okay so KISS isn't what i would call Metal, but any way...they grew up on metal...and the Beatles, who i also in no way would consider metal, but they are the gods...but back to my point, only when they started to venture into their own music taste sis they start to like the Punk-Rock scene. All they did was take the metal, the rock n' roll  and punk rock and link it to make this sound...so different...yet a bit \\"Seattley\\", but all in all amaizing. Yeah they had influences : Tad, The Melvins, Sonic Youth, The Vaselins, The Velvet Underground...but it doesn't mean that they stole their work. Kurt Cobain was a brilliant man, a man of many words, who got it out through music, who was inspired not a stealer. Yet all of these people decide that he's a loser, he can't do anything right, he's a suicidal druggie, he can't sing, he can't play the guitar...well for all of those people...i would LOVE to see you guys play the way he did, or better. I would love to see you sing the way he did, or better. I would LOVE to see you guys even TRY to write the way he did, and go through the ailments that he had to, all the stress and still be perfect or even come close to what Kurt Cobain was...i would LOVE to...  Kurt Cobainwas a genius...and you aren't...face the facts you jealous [...]...Good day.

Any writer - even one who doesn't like King's work - should be eager to learn how he does it.<br /><br />The book is direct, to the point, and written in the same conversational, engaging tone as the rest of his work. The book begins with the story of King's own development as a writer - a story that is fascinating and worth the price of the book just for itself. Then it goes to divulge the tricks and techniques that he believes all good writers should make use of. My favorite is probably his simple, direct rule for rewriting: \\"second draft = first draft minus ten percent\\" - I like it so much that I couldn't resist quoting it in my own book!<br /><br />The book is truly well titled.

B000002HJA|5.0|This album completes the legendary trilogy alongside the other classics 'Welcome to Sky Valley' and 'Blues For the Red Sun'. With this album, their last full length, Kyuss alter their sound and style slightly, creating a deeper and lower guitar tone and generally slower tempos. The result is a huge moody monolith of an album that sweeps aside thousands of other 'stoner' bands. '...And The Circus Leaves Town' is a fine way for Kyuss to wave goodbye after a truly legendary and tragically short-lived career.<br /><br />'Hurricane' boots things off in short and sweet rocking style. It's a fun rocker, but a rather mediocre start to the album when considering the immediately engulfing openers from their past albums. But this I found would be the style of the album, it is a slow burner, gradually progressing and weaving. 'One Inch Man' is another short and sharp track, but this time the band creates a more subtle and sophisticated song. Homme's guitar paying especially shines on this with some very cool and almost psychedelic guitar effects, complemented by the classic John Garcia raspy vocal delivery. Generally John's vocals are less in the mix with this album when compared to previous releases, taking a seat behind Homme's guitar playing, which is at its all time best.<br /><br />The album really picks up when 'Phototropic' begins. This song shows a new side to Kyuss - a moodier, more melancholic sound with a slow, brooding build up leading to the desperate croons of John singing 'under light I have never seen/reach up to the sun'. 'El Rodeo' continues the moodier, atmospheric style, once again building to huge walls of sound and John's emotionally packed vocals. Often seen as a two-song piece, it remains a highlight of Kyuss' career.<br /><br />'Tangy Tizzle' starts the closing of the album. It is the best closing in Kyuss' career, and simply one of the best in metal and rock history. Personally I feel the last four tracks on this album create the pinnacle to Kyuss' short-lived career. After the heavy and fun rocker of 'Tangy Tizzle', something more similar to 'Blues For The red Sun' style, 'Size Queen' delivers one of Kyuss' best songs. Striking me as a combination of the 'Sky Valley' structure of verse/chorus (something the band generally get away from on this album, most of the songs just flow into different sections), and the newer moody, brooding guitar tone this album introduces.<br /><br />Then 'Catamaran' hits the listener with its sheer beauty. Calming yet highly melancholic, it makes for great reflective listening, recalling all sorts of feelings depending on your mood - sometimes it feels very lonely and vast, sometimes it's a cool summers breeze with a refreshing 'cool air'. Whatever it evokes, it is a masterpiece of simplicity. 'Spaceship Landing' comes crashing in with its bellowing drums and dirty sounding guitars. Starting off like a straight-forward heavy rocker with angst-ridden lyrics about insecurity and drunkenness, the band then display their talents and exactly why they are the kings of the genre. A simply gigantic riff comes in, slowing the song down to a menacing, brutal pace. One of Homme's best riffs ever, and he knows it, he carries on. The song weaves in and out of outstanding sections, and needs to be heard by all rock fans. It is such a tribute to the band's talents. Their ability to create flooring riffs and melodies - sharp direction changes - complex structures...all in one epic track. I cannot praise this closer enough.<br /><br />Quite simply this is one of the best metal albums you will ever hear. I find it amazing some people call this their worst effort, or even a 'boring' album. The quality of musicianship is unbelievable, making other `stoner' rip-offs look like dummies.he heavy and fun rocker of 'Tangy Tizzle', something more similar to 'Blues For The red Sun' style, 'Size Queen' delivers one of Kyuss' best songs.

Whatever it evokes, it is a masterpiece of simplicity. 'Spaceship Landing' comes crashing in with its bellowing drums and dirty sounding guitars. Starting off like a straight-forward heavy rocker with angst-ridden lyrics about insecurity and drunkenness, the band then display their talents and exactly why they are the kings of the genre. A simply gigantic riff comes in, slowing the song down to a menacing, brutal pace. One of Homme's best riffs ever, and he knows it, he carries on. The song weaves in and out of outstanding sections, and needs to be heard by all rock fans. It is such a tribute to the band's talents. Their ability to create flooring riffs and melodies - sharp direction changes - complex structures...all in one epic track. I cannot praise this closer enough.    Quite simply this is one of the best metal albums you will ever hear. I find it amazing some people call this their worst effort, or even a 'boring' album. The quality of musicianship is unbelievable, making other `stoner' rip-offs look like dummies.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|Mike patton has done it again, creating a multitude of ambitious soundscapes draped across a tapestry of lounge and pop, and for the most part, it works. <br />Being a fan of his more \\"Avant garde\\" wok, such as Fantomas and Mr.Bungle, I approached this album with more than a little trepidation. Although most of his output is consistently amazing, I have been greatly disappointed from time to time (Maldoror, anyone?) <br />I'd heard a few demos on the net, and instantly fell in love with them, but news that Patton had leaked them onto the net to misdirect fans as to the TRUE direction of the record kind of dampened my anticipation. For some reason i became convinced it would be a gansta rap album. complete with obligatory bling necklace adhered to the packaging. <br /> <br />Thankfully, this wasn't the case and, to my surprise, two songs (5 Seconds and Neighborhood spaceman) are tidied up and tweaked versions of the demos I loved so much. <br />So, how does the rest of the album stand up? <br />Well, it is extremely poppy, that's for sure, but not in the traditional sense. Think watching eurovision on a bad acid trip with dirty industrial beats subtly humming in the background. <br /> <br />The first three songs made me sit up and pay attention straight away, but mid-way, it felt as if the record was lagging. I switched it off for a few hours and came back to it and recommenced and the latter half suddenly didn't seem as trying as it had earlier. This is definitely an album that deserves more than one listen, although some songs do sound slightly repetitious, and the demo version of \\"Spaceman\\" is far superior. <br /> <br />All in all though, a pretty aweome album by one of the most versatile musicians in music today, and well worth a listen. <br />Oh, and I agree that the last song sounds like vintage Faith No More, especially the chorus.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Although it has already been said countless times, this was a performance of a life time for Felicity Huffman. After I saw the film I had an overwhelming sense of not only \\"movie euphoria\\" as put by The Wall Street Journal, but that the performance I had just witnessed would now be a barometer in which all others must measure. She embodied every aspect one wishes to see in a character, so much that is a movie about all humanity and not just the gender-challenged. This is the true intent of acting, to tell a story. That is was she did. I was literally moved to tears.
B000EDWL82|5.0|This is a great effort but for ME for buying this great album. Sure a lot of people can say that this sounds like Interpol, but then again we should say that Interpol and Editors sound like Joy Division the greatest influential band in the last 2 decades. Buy this! Is worth your money.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Reading countless reviews can often inspire one to contribute their own verse.  No exception.  10,000 Days is moving, deep, and astonishingly articulate.  That goes for the song craft as well as the conceptual nature.  TOOL has shown again that they simply demolish 99% of bands on earth.<br /><br />It's bizarre how quickly people write off a work of art like this when, in an instant, you can hear the amazing amount of effort that it takes to create something like this.  The depth, layering, and emotion pumped into this recording are overwhelming and infectious.  I can always understand that no one thing will be for everyone, and thank goodness, I refer rather to the dismissive reviews made by ignorant clods who don't even give it the 'It's not for me, but I can appreciate the musicianship' type consideration.  I resent the ubiquitous use of the word \\"filler\\" when perusing these reviews.  Bottom line: these are songs!  Just because Danny has to be crushing the kit and Maynard has be delivering his usual vocal dominance for it to be a TOOL song for you, does not discount that a composition has been created.  Not to mention, those who say the album is all filler seem to overlook the 11 minute songs elsewhere.  You are getting your money and mind's worth here.  Forgive my rant.  The album is the topic and I shall try to focus.<br /><br />The percussion is as good as anything Danny has done.  He traverses between crushing rhythms and the eerie wall of syncopated texture throughout the album.  There are moments toward the end of The Pot & 10,000 Days where he hits everything on the kit and it's just heaven.  Maynard is in amazing form.  Solid, thought provoking lyrics and the always impressive delivery.  Justin's tone is as deep as a Harley and adds wonderful texture.  Maybe the best I've heard him sound.  Adam's tone is not to be trifled with, although he certainly does a little recycling on this offering.<br /><br />All in all, I am thankful each and every time TOOL releases its next masterpiece and this album is a journey.  The transition from Intension into Right in Two gives shivers, as do the lyrics to 10,000 Days.  Treat yourself right and take the plunge.  Take it from me, a completely unbiased music fan who is clearly, in no way, 100% on their jocks.e TOOL releases its next masterpiece and this album is a journey.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|How could this DVD possibly not get a 5 star rating? Eric Clapton, Ravi Shankar, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Tom and the HeartBreakers, Jeff Lynne, Joe Brown,(and to a lesser extent, my favorite bassist ever, Klaus Voormann) etc, etc.  <br /> <br />With all these great artists, gathered, celebrating George and his music, it is amazing! ! ! <br /> <br />George Harrison is easily the most influencial person in my life. He always will be. When I heard about this DVD I went out and bought it, the second I could! ! ! <br /> <br />In short, if you have any respect for (...arguably, although not for me. To me, he IS) the greatest person ever to walk this earth, you will buy this wonderful momento, to this incredible person.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|We all know why we're here-we worship the guy who croons as well as he croaks. So how does this Peeping Tom thing work out? Well...4 years on and you expect a little something more, but this is a fun and interesting trip-hop Patton showcase nonetheless...plus you get to hear Norah Jones say the F-word. Does it sound \\"dated\\"? Well, yeah, a little. Will this win Mr.Patton any new fans? Who gives a s^&t? Check it out, I guarantee you'll dig at least half of it, and LOVE at least 3 jams. I'm really likin' the last track-it's pretty rockin', and the hook is nice and sweet, FNM style. Good times to be had here, Patton disciples, good times, but Angel Dust/California it is not...but really, what is? I've seen Faith No More, seen Mr.Bungle, seen Lovage, seen Tomahawk, seen Fantomas...and I WILL see Peeping Tom...and so will you. End of discussion.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|after years of patton putting out mediocre records (the last thing he did that i really loved was tomahawk) finally we have peeping tom! patton bathes us in his beautiful voice once again! this album is anchored in the hip hop world with undeniable hip hop beats. musically this is very much how i expected it to be. some songs are really good, others are just bad. it seems to me that every album that patton has been a part of has had at least one song that i would skip each time (with the exception of mr bungle, california, and angel dust). this, has two or three that really aren't worth a second listen. i've tried to listen to just those songs without listening to the rest of the album, but, they still don't cut it.  <br /> <br />the good songs are fantastic, and luckily, it's made up of mostly good songs.
0156027321|5.0|The adventures of Piscine Patel start on page one and don't nearly end with the end of the story. Through his unpredictable life, we see nothing more than an average teenager with uncertainty and adventure in every step. What makes the story so mind clenching is the intense connection it makes with personal lives and the question; who is God?   <br />Piscine grew up with the mockery of every day's adolescence, the peer pressure of growing up, and the twist of never knowing what will happen next. Piscine, who soon shortened his name to Pi after repeatedly being called Pissing Patel originally grew up on a large zoo owned by his father. Through his years at the zoo, he gains knowledge that an average person couldn't obtain, which in the end turns out to save his life. As with all maturing teens, curiosity and the need to try everything succumbs us all, including Pi. Not only does Pi seek God in search of fulfillment, but he does so through three different religions. Eventually, things change and the Patel family packs up to seek refuge in Canada after packing up and shipping the animals from the zoo.  <br /> As Part Two of the novel opens, the first sentence, so insignificant at first, becomes a sentence of great importance. \\"The ship sank.\\" Yann Martel uses a unique form of writing to get a grave point across. Throughout the novel, personal annotations dissolve into the readers mind and body as they begin to see the story through two points of view; in the act of, and the after effect of the strenuous events. The perplexity and awkwardness of the setting of the story trap the reader into always wondering what will happen next. Unlike most stories, Life of Pi is totally unpredictable. How many stories have you read where the main character ends up in a lifeboat with a 450-pound Bengal tiger? <br /> At the beginning of the story we find out that Pi inevitably will survive and although you may think that that would ruin the entire story, it doesn't. The reader is constantly curious what Pi Patel must do in order to survive what becomes 227 days. Living on the water for such a long period of time not only seems nearly impossible, but for a 16-year-old vegetarian living with a huge tiger, it seems completely psychotic! However, Pi musters all the strength he gained through his three acquired religions and the knowledge from growing up on a zoo to outwit his opponents.  <br /> One of the most difficult questions to answer about Life of Pi is simply what is it about? Obviously it is about a young man surviving while floating on the ocean for seven months, but when you look at it even deeper it isn't quite so obvious. Some may see it as a story through which one questions who and where God is. Others may look at it and see Pi's struggles and go as far as to say it is a story about a young man looking deep within to find who he really is. And even others may look at it and take it as it is, Pi Patel, a young Indian, taking life's rollercoaster, getting the short end of the stick, and living to tell the tale of his heart-wrenching twists. So you and only you can decide which it is. Why not jump in, take a bite and savor the juicy adventure through the life of Pi Patel. <br />
0312995423|2.0|Like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and Dan Brown's other books, \\"Digital Fortress\\" succeeds with a particular appeal: it makes stupid people feel smart.   <br /> <br />All the heroes are really, really smart people.  They are all brilliant.  One of them even has an eidetic memory!  How's that for smart? <br /> <br />The only problem is that the actual mathematical and cryptographic content is nonsense.  \\"Brute force\\" analysis by \\"supercomputer\\" does not undo all ciphers, does not even undo ciphers that were available right after World War II.  Everyone who knows anything about the history of cryptography knows this. <br /> <br />But don't let the facts bother you.  After all, it's only a story.  Read it -- after putting your brain in the freezer -- and you can feel really, really smart, too.  Maybe you can pretend you have an eidetic memory. <br /> <br />There's even a real, real easy cipher for you to solve in the book.  Solve it and pretend you're a brilliant mathematician. <br /> <br />Oh, yeah.  Be sure to pretend that people who don't fall down and worship Dan Brown's books are really, really dumb. <br /> <br />It'll make you feel that much smarter.
B000000OQF|5.0|Usually, i'm very skeptical about buying a CD when I've only heard one song by the band. I gave in and purchased this album. It was the best $10 I ever spent. The entire album just rocks! While I enjoyed all the songs, my favorite is \\"Sweet Child O' Mine.\\" The opening guitar solo is amazing. Axl's vocals are fantastic throughout the album.<br /><br />After buying this album, I can say that I am a fan of GNR now. I highly recommend this album to anyone looking to become a fan of GNR or just looking for a kick @$$ rock band.
B000002GYR|5.0|Having gotten into Waits through his experimental avant-garde albums (Bone Machine was my first taste of him), I was a little disappointed when I heard his 70s era music. It wasn't what I was expecting, nor was it the sort of music I tended to listen to anyway. The combination of blues, jazz with his own unique twist simply didn't quite click for me. However, having not listened to any Waits in quite a long time, I threw on this album on a whim and couldn't believe what I was hearing. How had I dismissed such great music before? Was I mad or deaf or both?<br /><br />Yes, Closing Time is a truly remarkable album. Soulful, tuneful and driving, it's simply chock full of great, memorable songs. His voice is the most accessible I've heard it. No growling or deep falsetto (if you've heard some of his stranger stuff you know what I mean by that) here, just his unique sounding crooning. While it may not be as off the wall as later material, it's every bit as expressive. The album is largely vocal and piano driven, with drums, guitars, strings and saxophone joining in when appropriate. The overall mood is somewhat somber though some tracks are a little more upbeat (such as Ice Cream Man).<br /><br />Listening to this album late at night has almost drawn me to tears. It's incredible. If you're looking to get into early era Waits, you have to have it.
0679428895|4.0|What a wonderful blend of fiction and history.  It's a perfect blend of real characters, places, with fictional ones.  The fictional characters help you to imagine the real lives of all those folks that we've seen since we were kids of people caught by the explosion.  Now you can look at them and wonder which character they were in the book. <br /> <br />The story basically follows the hero (the Aquarius) as he tries to determine what is going wrong with the water supply on the peninsula.  In the process, we're met with his predecessor who seems to be embroiled in a cover-up of what's really happening up on the mountain that could just as easily be set in modern times. <br /> <br />Of course the book lapses into all sorts of heroics and almost impossible tales of survival by some, that would be worthy of a movie plot, but it is fiction, so enjoy the read.  I may have to try more of Mr. Harris's books. <br /> <br />My star ratings:  <br /> <br />One star - couldn't finish the book  <br /> <br />Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the author  <br /> <br />Three stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.  <br /> <br />Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.  <br /> <br />Five stars - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author. <br /> <br />
B000AP04FG|4.0|\\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" blends two genres -- high-speed action and bickering couple movie -- with fair success. Is it even remotely plausible?  Of course not. Is it great cinema. Nope. Is it fun to watch, if you don't mind a lot of cartoonish violence?  Yes.  Brad and Angelina work well together, and the script has occasional flashes of wit, so if you don't mind suspending your disbelief a lot for two hours, this is passable entertainment.
B0009QBLA8|1.0|... if nothing else, you've got to see it at least once just to experience it... my personal opinion is that you'll probably connect with ERASERHEAD (and with most Lynch productions) if you're the type who tends to walk on the wild side, intellectually speaking. Otherwise, you'll not likely find any redeeming value in it whatsoever unless you're a film student or possess slightly warped tastes.
B00005JOFO|2.0|I read good reviews about this movie. I wanted to like it.  So despite my husband's protests and my own hesitancy to watch gay men do their thing, I rented it.  Can we say DISAPPOINTMENT??   <br />I gave it 2 stars because of the beautiful scenery and because there were a few scenes that were good.  The story line had the potential to make a good movie, but it just wasn't there. I would like to have seen some background info.  I would like to have seen these characters brought to life.  These characters were empty.  There was just nothing to make us like them.  And there was absolutely no lead-in to the first sexual encounter, just out of nowhere they start going at it like animals?  That's lust, not love. They didn't even seem to like each other much! I have to admit that if I were the one paying them to take care of my animals and they were too busy entertaining themselves to watch the sheep, well I would have been upset too.  <br /> <br />Even if I did approve of homosexuality, I would not be able to rate this movie any higher. It was slow in some parts and way too fast in other parts, leaving me confused as to what year we were in.  Heath Ledger mumbled through the whole movie and I only caught about 1/4 of what he said.  That was very annoying. Jake Gyllenhaal did okay I thought, but nothing special.  <br /> <br />I think I really wanted to see LOVE.  I saw lust.  I saw violence, bordering on rape.  And I came away thinking, \\"Oh so gay men fight just like straight couples, except they beat each other up everytime just like two little boys on the playground??\\" I also saw men hurting their families.  I actually felt bad for Michelle Williams's character when she saw the encounter between her husband and......oh I can't even remember the character's name if that tells you how boring this was!  That was one of the few times I felt anything at all during this movie.  I felt no sympathy for their plight to be together.  Like I said, I felt almost nothing really.  Atthe end of the movie I felt very empty.  I've never felt this empty after a movie.  I always have SOME feeling either good or bad.  When the credits started rolling all I could think was that I'd wasted $4 renting this one!  <br /> <br />My husband thinks even 2 stars is too many for this movie.  We do agree that the movie could have been better if they had simply gone into the tent and kissed, leaving the rest to our imaginations.  We're not stupid, we would have known what was going to happen next without having to watch it. I think they mess up a lot of movies that way.....just let the people go into the bedroom and shut the door and we'll get the idea without having to actually see what they're doing. So yes, I would have reacted the same way if it was a heterosexual sex scene.  <br /> <br />If a re-make were possible, I'd say cut the sex-scene, give the characters personality, get rid of the annoying mumbling, and give us something more interesting than 2 hours of good scenery with a few good scenes thrown in.  <br /> <br />BM would not have been so highly rated if the couple had been straight.  That's all there is to it.........shock value.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best television series to come around in a long time.  My husband and I just bought the series on dvd.  We enjoyed the plot lines and the acting.  The show has a great ensemble of characters.  I usually have a hard time staying awake at night watching television, but this show kept me awake.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I enjoy a good horror story, and this one is that much better by being inspired by the true story of Anneliese Michel, a German woman who experienced a similar progression of events to those depicted in this movie.  I found the movie to be eerie and chilling, and a great movie to inspire thought about the existence of demons in our modern world.  The movie adroitly avoids determining whether there are demons, leaving each viewer to make their own decision.  Though I have always been skeptical regarding stories of possession, this movie certainly was convincing in its portrayal.<br /><br />Emily Rose starts life rather unremarkably.  She was brought up in a family that was strongly, but not extremely, religious.  She went away to college on a full scholarship, the pride of her family.  After a while, Emily began experiencing hallucinations, and she became convinced that demons possessed her.  A number of physical manifestations of Emily Rose's symptoms were very realistic and frightening.  Eventually Emily Rose requested an exorcism be performed after medical treatment seemed to fail.  Soon after the exorcism was performed, Emily Rose died.<br /><br />The trial of the priest that performed the exorcism is the central plot to this movie.  We see Emily Rose's life through the priest's eyes.  The story builds in terror as Emily's symptoms increase.  When the priest's agnostic attorney experiences bizarre manifestations, I started really getting chills down my spine.  I am unable to provide more details without giving away so much that there will be no need to watch the movie.<br /><br />I have always thought that the best horror movies rely on psychology.  This movie does just that.  The amount of blood is minimal, though some of the images are horrifying.  I was unable to see anything in the movie that I thought deserved more than a PG-13 rating, which makes the unrated version a lot of hype, but what is there enhances the chill factor substantially.<br /><br />Hollywood rarely attempts a movie with this level of sophistication.  When it does, it seems like there are inadequate rewards.  In the case of this movie, I confirm Siskel and Roeper's two thumbs up.  Fans of psychological horror and those who have always believed in demon possession will find this movie sufficiently horrific that they will want to watch this one more than once.>Hollywood rarely attempts a movie with this level of sophistication.

B0000640VO|5.0|a movie meant to have you see the world in a new way. lovely, honest, thought-provoking. one of the best movies ever made.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|You know, I was a big fan of the original series, too. I lost count of the number of times I saw A New Hope (as its called now) at around 150 times. And that was back in the 90s. And guess what? They're all still GREAT! I figured since anyone could get a copy of the series on videotape in the original version, then, hey it was really cool for Lucas to update the movies with some new effects and plot points and stuff. They weren't too impressive, but still, they added something new to something I'd seen a gazillion times.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, many of my fellow Star Wars fans went ape...uh...crazy. HOW DARE YOU ruin MY MOVIES!!!!They thundered! As if they had wrote, directed, funded or produced these movies or something. Hey guess what, you don't like it, don't BUY it! Try a rental. Read some reviews. Whatever. And after years of adults whining like children about how Lucas RUINED the movies, he goes back on his artistic vision (yeah, I know you'll probably debate that too, but he did create these movies, didn't he? Hmmm?) and what he initially promised and decides to throw the losers a bone. And he released the movies in their original release format, without the digital edits.  <br /> <br />And guess what? Now these losers start complaining wah wah about all the money they blew because they BELIEVED the guy, and he just wants to rip everyone off and how dare he. You know, he's plenty rich already. The problem is, he's trying to feed the ravenous beast called his fans and some people are never satisfied. I have this little store near me called Amoeba records. You can buy and sell used DVDs there. If you don't have somethng similar to that, there's also a little thing called EBay.  <br /> <br />At any time, you can buy OR sell practically any DVD in existence. Of course, you won't be the absolute first guy on the block to have the newest, mintiest freshest release of a movie unless you want to pay a premium. So why take out your own obsession on George Lucas? Sure, he's rich, and yes, his decision to update then unupdate the movies is a little questionable. But try waiting a little while and then buy what you will at your convenience. For cheap! Sorry guys, you took advantage of yourselves!  <br /> <br />Anyway, these movies rock. All of them. Even the Phantom Menace, sucky as it may be, has its wonderful moments and helps to introduce the whole story. They Rock. Go ahead and give this 1 star because you ripped yourself off. That doesn't change what these movies did for me and all of you as children, and for the whole freakin' movie industry. Next time, try waiting a bit before buying and use the extra money buying flowers for your mom. That's a much better investment!
630463949X|5.0|This DVD is worth 5 stars for Silver Springs alone. A stunning performance displaying the chemistry between Stevie and Lindsey, Silver Springs is a classic Stevie song and is performed with such emotion as Stevie and Lindsey face one another. Tension shows between the two decades after Stevie wrote the song about Lindsey. Awesome concert.
0451526384|5.0|I like Jane Austen, but this is a very special book, even for her. <br /> <br />When I was widowed a few years ago, I read Persuasion.  Lots or people here love this book, but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on. We live in a youth-oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young, the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness; this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness. Persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life.  You can start again, and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around, when you were young and didn't know what life was about. I know some people prefer the dashing heroes in Austen's other books, but Anne and Captain Wentworth are much closer to who most of us are. We are not flashy or rich; we don't always have supportive families; our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they've looked in our hearts. Love will not bring us land or access to the powerful, and it won't make our families act more kindly to us.  But what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life- death, sickness, insensitive people. <br /> <br />While women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early 19th century, they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages, the value of maturity, how having 'baggage' can be a sign that one has been places and seen things, and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense. Most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man. Because most women and men don't value these concepts, Persuasion is not ranked as highly as Austen's more exciting earlier novels.  Still, if I could only take one book with me to a desert island, this would probably be the one.
B000784WMW|4.0|Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark in my opinion is a version you can't watch just once. My children can attest to that! I have watched it over and over and over... And each time I do it becomes more endearing.  True it is somewhat dated and one must do a slight adjustment in one's mind as the scenes take place on a sound stage and in film. Nevertheless, the dynamic chemistry that takes place between the main characters and the superb acting abilities of all the actors makes this version so much worth the while. I have viewed the DVD entitled Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre (1997) and was very disappointed. I found it very difficult to believe that that version's Jane and Rochester would actually find love in one another. <br />Not so with this BBC version, you can see each characters growth that leads them down the path to their love and you believe it should have ended exactly there. I read the book stimultaneously as I watched the DVD and it pretty much sticks to the eloquent manner in which Charlotte Bronte wrote the classic. <br />Spend your money on this version or check it out at your local library to see what you think first.
B000009ROK|5.0|My wife introduced me to the bolero music of the early years and then introduced me to Luis Miguels Romances cd a few years ago.  This CD, his complete collection of his Romances is an unbelievable find.  To think, the once child singer at the age of 20 could belt out music like this.  He did this recording between the age of 20-25 and the music sounds soulfully mature and rich.<br /><br />One thing you will notice is the progression in the professionalism of the recordings, the richness of the voice and the feeling for the music.<br /><br />Amazingly, Luis Miguel still belts it out live.  His live voice is so much like his recorded voice.  I have never in my life heard such great music.  If you want to share wonderful time with the one you love, get this cd set.  It will be well worth the investment.
B00000AFFI|5.0|IS THIS DESIRE? is PJ Harvey's fourth studio album and by now I've learned to expect the unexpected, especially after such distinct varying styles of each of her previous records.  My expectations were pretty high though, cos TO BRING YOU MY LOVE was such an epic of an album that I didn't think she could top its grandeur but I'm glad to say this album is just as good, if not better than the latter.<br /><br />Whereas TBYML was blues infused, ITD? has got a heavy dose of electronica to it.  It is her most intriguing, most melodic and deepest record to date.  She's always been an excellent storyteller but her style of writing is beyond comparison here.  All the songs are written, arranged and sung like short stories with a lot of literary references, borrowing from (I imagine) some of her favorite writers thus glorifying each heroine's names, allowing Polly to try on different personas but never feeling trapped in any one.  It is most difficult to find words to describe this record, but I read one eloquent reviewer described it as \\"incandescent in its loveliness\\" and I couldn't agree more.  Lush with aching emotion and dripping with etherealness, ITD? moves away from the theatrics of TBYML to grace us with this bewitching of a masterpiece.<br /><br />The sultry first track \\"Angelene\\" really tears at your heart, setting the mood for the rest of the album.  It is about a prostitute who ponders what could've been and longs to but is terrified of starting a different way of life.  The lines \\"Rose is my color, and white.  Pretty mouth, Green my eyes\\" is almost directly quoted from a short story by JD Salinger.<br /><br />\\"The Sky Lit Up\\" to me is a very happy upbeat danceable song.  It is about finding inspiration in oneself.  A friend was saying it's actually a sinister kind of song but I don't care.  It makes me feel like everyday is my birthday and all I want to do is dance and celebrate me.<br /><br />\\"The Wind\\" is epic.  I don't know how else to describe this magnificent song.  It's told like a book, with the instruments being arranged to create a \\"windy\\" kind of atmosphere for that added, almost surreal feel.  Starts with a whispering narrator introducing us to a woman named Catherine who we learn was once the life of the party but is now an outcast.  Lonely and alone, she turns to the wind for solace.<br /><br />\\"My Beautiful Leah\\" is a bit reminisce of RID OF ME.  It is very dark and disturbing, from the heavy vibe of the synthesizers to Polly's deep vocals to the lyrical content, it is an evil of a song.  The last line indicates a lot: \\"It never leaves my mind, the last words she said, if I don't find it this time, then I'm better off dead.\\"<br /><br />At first listen \\"A Perfect Day Elise\\" sounds like \\"The Sky Lit Up\\" in that the beat is very light and happy, with the chorus seemingly very uplifting, \\"It's a perfect day, a perfect day, Elise!\\"  But upon learning the lyrics I realized this is quite the sinister song.  It tells the tale of sex, rejection, obsession and ultimately ends with the murder of Elise, shot down by her lover Joe.  So imagine the raised hair when realizing what I thought to be an \\"uplifting\\" chorus actually belies doom: today's a perfect day, Elise, a perfect day... to die.  \\"God is a sweat dripping down his back, the water soaked her blonde hair black.\\"  The title was inspired by another short story by JD Salinger called \\"A Perfect Day For Bananafish.\\"<br /><br />My favorite song off the record is \\"Catherine.\\"  This is the most alluring, most hypnotic song I've ever heard.  It is a song about extreme jealousy and intense hatred brought on by  unrequited love.  I think PJ took inspiration from Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights here, in style of writing and in theme.  In the song PJ curses Catherine Debarra, \\"Until the light shines on me, I damn to hell every second you breathe\\" almost in the same manner as Heathcliff cursing Catherine in the book, \\"And I pray one prayer, I repeat it till my tongue stiffens-- Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest, as long as I am living!\\"<br /><br />\\"Electric Light\\" is very strange, heavy in rhythm but spare sounding.  I know that didn't make sense but if you heard it you'll know.  I must admit this is my least favorite track on the album but I think it's mostly cos I don't really get it.<br /><br />\\"The Garden\\" is lushly beautiful.  I'm not sure if it's the title but I can't help but think of Adam and Eve and conjure all the brilliance of the stars and Gods when I hear this song.  As with most of the songs on the record, the melodic use of instruments is juxtaposed with very dark, very foreboding lyrics.  I hear this one is about some kind of sodomy.  Yikes.<br /><br />\\"Joy\\" has got to be the darkest, most heartbreaking song ever.  Geez, even thinking about this song makes me sad.  I can't help but pull for poor ol' Joy.  After all, she lives \\"a live unwed, thirty years old, never danced a step.\\"  It's a song of self-pity I think, and very harsh, about a woman named \\"Joy\\" but never had a taste of it in her life.  \\"I've been believing in nothing since I was born, it was never a question.\\"  Sigh. Poor Joy.<br /><br />The song that moves me most is \\"The River.\\"  It's like a dream to me, this song.  It makes me feel right with the world, if just for five minutes.  It's a song about evolution, I think, and of humanity.  Lovely, lovely song.<br /><br />\\"No Girl So Sweet\\" is awesome!  Fast and intense, I think this is Joy's sister song.  Only Joy's sister is the total opposite of Joy.  Imagine Joy but wilder.  Joy's sister is named Rage. She is the  talking-back, staying up all night and gettin' into trouble kinda gal.  The building of the music and intensity of Polly's voice towards the end of the song is electrifying.<br /><br />The album ends with the title track, \\"Is This Desire?\\"  I love that we get to hear Polly's voice crystal clear here because she is quite a singer but she doesn't necessarily showcase that in a lot of her songs.  My heart melts when I hear her croon, \\"Is this desire enough to lift us higher, to lift above?\\"<br /><br />So?  After all that's said, is it desire?  For me, you bet it is.  It may even be true love.till my tongue stiffens-- Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest, as long as I am living!\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Electric Light\\" is very strange, heavy in rhythm but spare sounding.

B0002IU988|1.0|Alterbridge, Creed and creed soundalikes are no good.  These are horrible songs by horrible bands - cheesy, watered-down, \\"safe\\" rock.  Please save your money and buy something else.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater are one of those bands that are tough to debate about because I can't really say that any of the things that people hate about them are untrue.  Yeah, the keyboards are prominent, often too prominent, and Labrie's voice is more musical theater than hard rock (even semi-fruity hard rock like this) and they frequently abandon songwriting entirely in favor of formless showboating.  Never the less, I like them a lot in spite of the flaws and my general distaste for stereotypical prog-metal.  (I *do* like genuinely progressive metal, but if you're just a DT clone you couldn't be called progressive in my mind.)  There endless wanking tends to entertain me greatly, apart from the keyboard solos, and the underlying songwriting is almost uniformly excellent, even if it is often obscured.<br /><br />Anyway, 'Images & Words' is the most universally liked DT album.  Probably more people consider SFAM the best DT album, but nobody seems to think that this is one of their weaker albums.  It's also one of their most commercial albums, with relatively restrained instrumentation by their standards and very polished production.  (Of course, they're never, ya know, raw, at all, but this has got a total processed 80's album vibe, despite being from '92.)  The instrumentation is impeccable, as always, and Labrie's vocals are better than usual.  His voice isn't actually as strong and dynamic as it could be, but off setting this is that he doesn't over do it nearly as often as he usually does in this album.<br /><br />The album opens with 'Pull Me Under' a total DT classic.  Some of their best riffing ever and just a lot of drive.  It's a bit more restrained, and lacks the standard everything but the kitchen sink instrumental section that you'd find in most longer DT tracks.  The  other epics are 'Take the Time', 'Metropolis', 'Under A Glass Moon' and  'Learning to Live'.  The first is the weakest of them, a solid song, but a bit undistinguished for them.  'Metropolis' is probably the most unusual song on the album, one of the darker, more formless and esoteric songs here.  It doesn't all come together, really, but the individual parts work well enough that I like it lot.  'Under a Glass Moon' reminds of the opener as it's another one of their more riff-driven, purely metallic songs.  It's not as good as 'Pull Me Under' but it's still very good.  'Learning to Live' is the longest track here, and the strangest one apart from 'Metropolis'.  It's got one of those insanely long, seemingly directionless instrumental sections that tends to drive people crazy.  What can I say, I think it works, and the core of the song has some of Labrie's most effectively melodic vocals.<br /><br />Then we've got the three shorter tracks.  The two ballads are 'Wait for Sleep' and 'Another Day'.  I prefer the piano-based 'Wait for Sleep', while 'Another Day' is a conventional power ballad with some rather unfortunate saxophone in it.  They're both pretty overwrought, I'll admit, but I can get into them and I think they're pleasant enough.  Lastly we have 'Surrounded' a very under appreciated song, I think.  Frankly, it doesn't seem like a song I'd like as it's all happy-sounding and stuff, but it somehow manages to affect me.  Probably the best vocals on the album.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This is a GREAT movie! The costumes, the scenery, and the sets are so AWESOME that you feel like you are actually in that time period! The characters are so interesting, especially the leper king with the mask. A lot of the battle scenes are cliched, but how can they not be after so many movies, like The Lord of the Rings! The story is very good, and kept me drawn to the screen the whole 3+ hours, which didn't feel that long. This is a very beautiful movie!!! Enjoy it in it's Director's Cut glory!!!
B0002EXH40|4.0|Like most of you, probably, I'd certainly prefer that Megadeth had continued to make thrash metal, but they're pretty good at this commercial, straight up classic metal.  Personally, I think 'Youthanasia' is easily better than 'Countdown to Extinction'.  Yeah, it's even more sanitized than that album, but in this case it's actually a good thing, cause 'Countdown...' was already watered down enough  that it wasn't exploding any heads as it is, while simultaneously not being as catchy and accessible as it might've been.  Basically, it needed to be either heavier or more melodic, here they went more melodic and thus we've got a better album.  More to the point, 'Countdown...' was just uneven and front-loaded.  Quick:  Try and think of what any of the last 5 or so songs on that album sound like.  I sure as hell can't.  'Youthanasia' is much more consistent.  There are a few somewhat uninspired tracks, but most of them are fairly instantly memorable.<br /><br />This album ain't overwhelmingly varied, almost exclusively mid-paced metal centering around the chorus.  As this is Megadeth we've got tons of sweet leadwork.  They're a bit more restrained here than in the old days, but that's appropriate considering the material.  The solos still sound fantastic, even if they aren't as frequent or as long.  And yeah, there are still a number of cool riffs, but it isn't much compared to classic thrash on this account. Ah well.<br /><br />'Reckoning Day' is a pretty solid opener.  It has some of the heavier, more interesting riffs on the album, but it's still got a very memorable chorus.  'Train of Consequences' is excellent too.  Kinda repetitious, but it's got a terrific, melodic chorus.  Too bad it isn't by someone who can sing at all, but it's well written enough that even Mustaine's mangled vox can't hurt it too much.  'A Tout Le Monde' is a very mainstream power-ballad, but it's about as good as that kinda thing gets.  Severely, conventional, yeah, but it works very well, though it too suffers particularly badly from shoulda-been-sung-by-someone-else syndrome.  (Though that's true of most Megadeth songs not on their debut.)  'The Killing Road' is one of the heavier, thrashier songs here, which isn't that much of a prize, but it still rocks pretty well.  'Blood of Heroes' is another cool one.  It's got a sorta big, epic sound to it that you don't find too much on the rest of Megadeth's material.  This album is a bit front stacked too, but it's still got some good songs at the end.  ('Black Curtains' is total filler, though.  Shoulda been cut.)  I especially like 'I Thought I Knew It All'.  Lotsa cool underlying, melodic guitar work in that one.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.

B00006AW2J|5.0|\\"Beggars Banquet\\" is the first and best of the Stones' holy trilogy which also includes \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\". The writing on this album is incredibly concise- the lyrics are bursting with working-class hero observations and every single one of the melodies is strong and to-the-point. It's hard to believe these guys were doing so many drugs! The outright rockers on this disc are the very clever \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", a snapshot of the boys that is \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\", the quintessential revolution anthem \\"Street Fighting Man\\" and the sexy, leering \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" and \\"Parachute Woman\\". The other astonishing tracks are the bluesy \\"No Expectations\\" (love the steel guitar on this!), \\"Prodigal Son\\"; the country flavored \\"Factory Girl\\" and the humorous \\"Dear Doctor\\". The album ends with the gospel-flavored \\"Salt of the Earth\\", the Stones' ode to the working class. Now that this album has been remastered you really owe it to yourself to pick up this essential album of one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Get Down!
B000000WJZ|5.0|Man, remember the early 90's when bands that didn't suck were occasionally allowed to play on the radio?  Now, don't get me wrong, the vast majority of grunge and alternative bands were garbage, but a few legitimately great bands were allowed to have immense popularity, and The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the best of 'em.  'Siamese Dream' was their real break out album, is a severely classic cd.<br /><br />This is just a two man show, Corgan and Chamberlin, which is fine cause those other two members were just designed to make the band look distinctive.  (Actually, I think that story is apocryphal, but it's totally plausible, anyway.)  There's a painful lack of interesting drummers in mainstream rock, and Jimmy Chamberlin is one of the most obvious exceptions to the rule.  He's at the absolute top of his game here with tons of energetic beats and frenetic, jazz-fusion rolls and fills.  Corgan sings and plays guitar and bass here, but he's mostly significant as a songwriting, of course.  The songs here consist primarily of acoustic ballads and huge sheets of guitar noise which still manage to have an undeniable melodic edge which are used to create both driving rockers and loud, very loud ballads.  Corgan does all this very well.  His vox are severely limited and an acquired taste, but I think he fits the music nicely.  And, most shockingly of all, he writes teen-angsty lyrics that don't fill me with bitter rage and aren't painfully juvenile.<br /><br />Great though this album is, it could stand a little pruning.  Most notably, the bizarre, largely instrumental 'Silverf*ck' could stand to go.  It's not a bad song, and is fairly interesting, but with 12 other tracks it seems to drag things out a bit too much and doesn't really fit.  Pacing is also a slight problem in that each of the first 9 songs is a classic, and the last 4 tracks are still good, but definitely not as good.<br /><br />The album opens with 'Cherub Rock', one of the definitive SP songs.  Massive, layered guitars, cryptic vocals and fantastic, snare intensive drumming from Chamberlin.  'Quiet' is one of the darkest, most rockin' tracks here.  It's excellent all around, but the wild drumming really takes it to the next level.  Next we have 'Today' which is *the* definitive SP song, and arguably the definitive non-grunge alternative song.  You've heard it many times, you must've, and how you feel about it'll probably determine how you like this album.  I think it's a classic, one of the best uses of the standard, loud-soft-loud template in alt-rock.  'Rocket' is a somewhat different track, one of the more driving songs but with a happier feel to it.  Another fantastic song which comes to a fun crescendo, and it's actually somewhat inspiring in its way.  'Disarm' is an acoustic track with strings, and a very effective one.  It's got some of Corgan's best vox on the album.  'Geek USA' is the best rocker on the album.  Chamberlins drumming here is even better than on 'Quiet'.  Finally we have 'Mayonaise', which is probably the best ballad here.  It's just another fine illustration of Corgan's ability to make a wall of guitar noise into something beautiful, and it's got a nice bit of unexpected acoustic guitar thrown in.<br /><br />I could go on, but ehh, that's enough.

B000002J1F|4.0|_Fragile_ is undoubtedly in Yes's top five best albums and also contains five or so of their best songs.  So how, you may ask, is this not at the level of their very most incredible albums if approximately two-thirds of the songs are true classics?  Just a few pieces of filler, which can truly throw an artwork's elan off.  Listen to their later _90125_.  I am of the opinion that there is no song there as strong as _Fragile_'s \\"Long Distance Runaround\\"  or \\"Heart of the Sunrise.\\"  Yet it is a stronger album that I revisit more often than I do _Fragile_ simply because there is not a single weak moment on _90125_.<br /><br />The filler pieces here fascinated me when I was a boy.  I had never heard a band put a solo instrumental interlude like \\"Cans and Brahms\\" on an album.  As an adult, it is a canned Brahms distraction that falls in between \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"We Have Heaven.\\"  Wakeman isn't up to the level he attained as a soloist later in the band.  Anderson's vocal bit that follows it, however, has sparkle, enough to be a motif decades later in their  latter-day take on it on _The Ladder_.  It shows the Zen proportions of Yes in miniature at this point in their progression.  \\"Cans and Brahms\\" shows that Wakeman can play classically.<br /><br />After \\"We Have Heaven\\" is something of an unheralded Yes masterpiece, \\"South Side of the Sky\\" (it definitely deserves to be on the \\"Best of\\" packages at least as much as \\"the Yes song everyone knows\\": \\"Roundabout\\").  \\"South Side\\"'s mixture of lurching trudge, uplifting harmony, and instrumental innovation makes it an infectious experience, not to mention a template for reflective/heavy music for decades to come (I'd like someone to tell me that Mars Volta haven't listened to this song over and over again).  And then after that, another comparative throw-away, at least in comparison to the impeccable standard they have set with \\"Roundabout,\\" \\"We Have Heaven,\\" and \\"South Side\\" (ignore \\"Cans and Brahms\\" in this impeccability standard).  Bruford's redoubtable drum skills are thrown into the mix as a thirty-second afterthought on \\"Five Percent of Nothing.\\"  Maybe they should have turned this into a double album so each soloist got their full due.  Chris Squire gets minutes on \\"The Fish\\" and his basswork sticks in your psyche forever.  Is Chris Squire a better bassist than Bill Bruford is a drummer?  Certainly not.  But you can't properly have a three-minute drum piece on a rock album, now, can you?  Well, I think they should have done this or just cut out the soloist showcase thing all together.  ELP were able to give Carl Palmer his full due (I know--only three soloists in ELP) on the almost-contemporaneous _Brain Salad Surgery_ (the piece by Ginastera called \\"Toccata\\").  This is Yes, for god sake, they can do almost do whatever they want at this point in their career, including making a double disc.<br /><br />But they can ALMOST do what they want.  This is the album that catapulted them to the top inarguably.  AFTER this, they could do whatever they want, no questions asked.  And then they want on to make the perfect album of all perfect albums: _Close to the Edge_.  They ditched the solo showcase thing and there has never been a better album.  Before you think I'm too critical of the unforgettable _Fragile_, just realize that I know that Yes worked on a learning curve after losing Tony Kaye on keyboards.  Considering it is a learning curve to absolute unrivalled status in the history of rock and most of _Fragile_ is already the best that rock can be, don't take the fact that two short songs on here are filler as reason to not own this album.  There is a reason that Jack Black passes this out to the student keyboardist in _School of Rock_ (besides the fact that \\"Roundabout\\" is on it).  The reason is that there are many incredible songs on here that any rock completist should have in her collection (I've never heard \\"South Side of the Sky\\" on radio, for example; buy the album simply for thisreason).<br /><br />Let it be settled here once and for all.  I love Yes, Yes is love, forever and ever, \\"here is here\\" (\\"We Have Heaven\\").r this reason). <br /> <br />Let it be settled here once and for all.

Considering it is a learning curve to absolute unrivalled status in the history of rock and most of _Fragile_ is already the best that rock can be, don't take the fact that two short songs on here are filler as reason to not own this album.  There is a reason that Jack Black passes this out to the student keyboardist in _School of Rock_ (besides the fact that \\"Roundabout\\" is on it).  The reason is that there are many incredible songs on here that any rock completist should have in her collection (I've never heard \\"South Side of the Sky\\" on radio, for example; buy the album simply for thisreason).<br /><br />Let it be settled here once and for all.  I love Yes, Yes is love, forever and ever, \\"here is here\\" (\\"We Have Heaven\\").r this reason). <br /> <br />Let it be settled here once and for all.  I love Yes, Yes is love, forever and ever, \\"here is here\\" (\\"We Have Heaven\\").
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had somehow missed the entire Firefly/Serenity phenomenon until last month when a friend of mine let me borrow his copy of Serenity. I've now purchased this excellent movie as well as the first season of Firefly. I find the characters compelling, the villain menacing, the action enthralling and the concept visionary. If you love a good sci-fi romp in which you can really get connected with the characters Serenity might be just what you're looking for. I haven't enjoyed any movie/series this much since watching the original Star Wars trilogy as a kid.
B000ANVQ0K|2.0|For Women: You get Leonardo DiCaprio and a love story.    For Men: You get a sex scene and plenty of death.    For White People: You get to see a lot of white people and no blacks. (I'm being facetious.)    For Black People: You get to see a lot of white people DROWN.(I'm being facetious, I told you.)    For Young People: You get to see two youngsters as the leads.    For Old People: You get to see that there is a heaven when you die.    For Rich People: You get to see the underprivileged working so far in the bottom of the ship they look like they're underneath it.    For Poor People: You get to see a bunch of rich snobs DROWN.    Titanic is overblown and badly written. It's Gigli with a 200 million dollar budget. Only Gigli has better acting. The love story isn't believable at all. I applaud Cameron for using a woman who isn't wafer thin, but you never really buy Kate Winslet as a love interest of Leonardo DiCaprio. One re-view-er (Clint) even said religous people were hypocrites to love this movie because the love story with Winslet and DiCaprio has them having premarital sex. Honey, if religious people avoided every movie that had elements of sin in it, they'd never watch anything. You don't have to condone things in order to enjoy them. Get with it man!    I wanted Titanic to lose so badly at the Oscars, but much to my chagrin, it didn't lose.    It was laughable that everyone thought Leo was worth 25 million a movie after this. I notice no one contemplated giving Kate Winslet 25 million a movie even though she shared the lead, and is a much better actor.    In a nutshell, the movie isn't that good. It is a technical achievement in film, but it lacks a soul. Not to mention, the folks could have drowned 45 minutes sooner.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave's effectiveness and intensity displayed within the twelve tracks on their sophomore release \\"Out Of Exile\\" is without a doubt comparable to their debut self-titled album.  Guitarist Tom Morello was clearly given the green light to include some of his best guitar work to date while bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk were given the opportunity to \\"let loose\\" a bit more than their previous effort.  Although none of the tracks could be considered a \\"filler,\\" some of the highlights of the album include \\"Out Of Exile,\\" their single \\"Be Yourself,\\" the intense \\"Drown Me Slowly,\\" \\"Yesterday To Tomorrow,\\" the very Soundgarden'ish \\"#1 Zero\\" and \\"The Curse\\" cementing a perfect end to the album.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Anybody who thinks this album is full of fillers and pointless ambient noises, well, you're partly right. This album, however, holds a secret track. If you synchronize tracks 3+11 (splice it so that 11 plays the exact second 3 ends) and then play that at the same time as track 4. It \\"completes\\" the title track in all its full glory. All the ambient noises and pieces of guitar in tracks 3 and 11 are actually gaps from track 4. this kind of stuff is deep, and i was absolutely amazed at what the synchronization did. I was in awe of how much effort this band puts into their albums.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I can't believe all the hype about this show. My husband and I started watching the series on DVD right after finishing the Six Feet Under series, which we loved. Maybe we needed more time between shows to lower our standards, because by comparison, Firefly plays out like a high school production. The dialogue is poorly written, the jokes are predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is VERY average. (Nathan Fillion does a respectable job, but the rest of the ensemble I expect to be unemployed for a long time.) We are simply stunned at the response to this show. One reviewer hailed it as the \\"next Star Wars\\". What the ??!!? Not even close. Not even a light year away.
B000009VOL|5.0|I don't even remember finding out about Cat Power, but I listened to her newest album, \\"The Greatest\\" and fell in love with her emotional style of singing.  I checked out \\"Moon Pix\\" and it happened to be a chilly, rainy day.  Let me just say, this album and a cloudy, rainy day go hand in hand.  The music is hauntingly beautiful, and the lyrics tear apart your soul.  Some people think Cat Power can't sing, but Chan Marshall (her real name) proves that you don't need to have a Mariah Carey voice to be able to have beautiful music.  And trust me, Mariah Carey doesn't even come close to Cat Power! <br /> <br /> <br />
0156027321|4.0|One of the most creative books I've read in a long while, Life of Pi was both educational and inspirational. As a fan of symbolism, my mind was on overdrive just thinking \\"what's it all mean?\\" Martel brilliantly weaves the animal's inherent instincts, behaviors and mystique into the story to make a desperate situation seem even more hopeless. I won't give it away, but when you're finished reading this book - I can almost guarantee you'll flip back to the front and try to find the clues you might have missed... Really, a great escape.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|Here's my story with mystic river. Began reading the book, but got bored and gave the movie a shot since it was a very interesting story. The movie pulled me in just like the book, and Sean Penn's acting was very good. I thought Tim Robbins was horrible and could barely stand watching him. When you get to the point in the movie where everything ties together it is, at least for me, a let down. And, overall, it made this just a mediocre movie for me. However, Stephen King said in an Entertainment Weekly column that it was one of the best movies he's seen in years. So, take his opinion or mine.
0224076051|5.0|This is an exciting discussion of a few problems facing mainstream theoretical physics.  The Standard Model was developed in the 70s.  It describes the strong nuclear force mediated by gluons between quarks, and electroweak symmetry.  The latter at low energy collisions (i.e., not too close to particle cores) is broken into a short ranged weak force mediated by three massive gauge bosons, and an infinite range photon force which gives rise to the inverse square laws of electromagnetism for charges and magnets.    Peter Woit points out that the Standard Model is very useful science.  It can predict decay rates for a whole range of particles like muons very accurately (0.1%), it predicted the masses of the massive, weak force gauge bosons (W and Z particles) which were discovered at CERN in 1983, and it also allows a quantitative prediction of many other things.  Quantum electrodynamics, part of the electroweak quantum field theory of the Standard Model, makes predictions for lamb shift in the energy levels of the electron in hydrogen, the magnetic moments of leptons (eg. muon and electron), which agree to experiment to many significant figures (more accurately than any other theory in history, including general relativity).    String theory is usually presented (without evidence but with excess hype) as being the \\"best candidate for the final theory\\", an extension of existing well-accepted ideas of the Standard Model to produce a complete theory.  However, as Peter Woit states in this book, the actual problems of physics which are known to be real are simply ignored by string theories, while various speculative or imaginary solutions are invented in string theory which contains neither useful quantitative predictions, nor physical dynamics of a scientifically useful kind.    The actual major problems facing physics concern (1) dynamical (predictive) unification of gravity/general relativity and the Standard Model (string theory is merely consistent with a spin-2 graviton force boson, and makes no predictions that can be checked), (2) the quantitative masses and gravity strength (these are all a related problem, since gravity acts on mass rather than charge, so the Standard Model doesn't describe any of this), and (3) the actual mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking, i.e., how the vacuum polarisation (or other phenomena relating to a speculative Higgs field) give mass to three out of four of the electroweak gauge bosons at low energy, hopefully predicting an exact value for the key particle involved such as a Higgs boson.    String theory fails to even tackle any of this.  String theory instead postulates 10 dimensional superstrings with 6 dimensions rolled up into a complex Calabi-Yau manifold (Witten showed using M-theory that this can be unified with 11 dimensional supergravity).  String theory includes supersymmetry (SUSY) which attempts to demonstrate unification of forces at a massive energy - far beyond anything achievable (even with a particle accelerator the size of the solar system) - by the extravagant addition of a superpartner for every existing particle.  None of these superpartners have been observed.  Nor does string theory predict anything quantitatively checkable about them, such as the exact energy of superpartners.    Claimed successes for string theory such as \\"predicting gravity\\" are vacuous because there is no prediction, no connection between abject speculation and reality.  The mathematics for string theory is clearly what defends it from being dismissed out of hand as crackpot speculation by the media and by its own practitioners: because of the complex mathematical nature of the Calabi-Yau manifold, it yields a \\"landscape\\" of a spectacular number of different possible metastable vacua for the ground state of the universe, about 10^350 solutions.  This uselessness, far from proving string theory is \\"not even wrong\\", is usually interpreted as meaning it covers everything conceivable and is a safe bet to stake an academic career on.  It's snakeoil.  As the position of string theory gets worse, more popularising hype is poured into the media about the \\"possibility\\" of using strings to communicate by telepathy backwards in time across the universe, and other science fiction.  (This is just like the band playing cheerfully as the Titanic sinks.)    Let's spell it out: string theory is so vague it is consistent with about 1-followed-by-350-zeroes different ground states.  So much for the science of string theory.  The next thing is that string theory involves group-think.  Peter Woit does not unfortunately present his own ideas in this book, which are interesting alternatives to string theory.  This book is aimed at a wide audience and his mathematical papers can be found quite easily on the internet for free.  But he makes the point that physics is more likely to advance rapidly if there is a diversity of ideas than with almost everyone thinking around the same mainstream \\"fashionable\\" speculation for decades.  String theory is a new ether, and has bogged down physics for twenty years.  The landscape of vacua is a pathetic end to physics.  String theory is not even wrong.
0141439513|5.0|When I went to a bookshop, this book 'Pride and Prejudice' charmed me with pretty book cover and familier title.<br /><br />When I started reading this book, I could not stop, i had to finish it. This book is very classical love story, even though it is written in a difficult english style. I was able to fall into this book very easily.<br /><br />Firstly, it was interesting how Jane portrayed the fluttering mind of village people like how all the villege people tried to contact with new villeger Bingley.<br /><br />Also it was interesting that how Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's first impresstion is bed. That shows the first impression is not everyting, it's changeable by knowing the person in depth.<br /><br />Combine with that period of time, the love story continues. I was queit impressed how their only hope is to get married. For example, wickham's case. Elizabeth's sister get crush on him, and just fall into him and gets marry with him.<br /><br />I also knew that in that period of time, there was big gap between rich and poor same as today. This story is more meaningful because the story overcomes the richness. Also the way Mr. Darcy acts out, how he helps Elizabeth without letting her know and how he tries to protext him was really romantic.<br /><br />One another thing is that these days, most of the love stories reverse the story at the end that might give readers a thrill. But this very classic book just kept on going to one direction the way that i predicted. That is the reason that i chose this book to write a review on.<br /><br />Lastly, as I read this book I learnt that the appearance is not everything, the thing that charms person is one's scent. What kind of personality and chracteristic the one has. I think everyone wants to be pretty and be nice like a flower infront of a person the he or she loves. But important thing is that should be not determinded by a appearance but by inner personality.
B000021YQV|5.0|Now, listen. There was no way that System of a Down could possibly top their self-titled debut, and they didn't with \\"Toxicity\\". But \\"Toxicity\\" is still unbelievably good and it is also the album that got System of a Down into the mainstream with singles \\"Chop Suey!\\", \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Aerials\\".<br /><br />But who cares if you hear it on the radio? Mostly everything on the radio is [...] anyways. Except for this. Let's look at the tracks.<br /><br />1) Prison Song: It starts off with one drum beat and then a pause, but then it breaks into a few more drum beats and then guitars and finally vocals. Wow, this is good.<br />10/10<br />2) Needles: Still as hard as \\"Prison Song\\" before it, Needles is a very good song about a crack addict or something.<br />10/10<br />3) Deer Dance: I think this is better than Needles, can't quite top Prison Song however.<br />10/10<br />4) Jet Pilot: I don't know about this one. And remember my ratings are by System of a Down standards only. A 3/10 song for System of a Down still might be a 9 or a 10 for most bands.<br />8/10<br />5) X: Even worse than Jet Pilot.<br />6/10<br />6) Chop Suey!: Their hardhitting first single and boy is it good. You can't beat Chop Suey!. Even better than Prison Song.<br />10/10<br />7) Bounce: Although it is less than 2 minutes long, Bounce is still one of the best songs on here. Full of adrenaline and plus it's about an orgy.<br />10/10<br />8) Forest: This is where Toxicity is just not as good as their first CD. Although 5 of the first 7 songs were awesomely awesome, this is the start of the 2nd half, and that's not as quite as good as the first half.<br />7/10<br />9) ATWA: Just like Forest, disappointing after the first 7 songs.<br />7/10<br />10) Science: See \\"ATWA\\" and \\"Forest\\".<br />7/10<br />11) Shimmy: After 3 mediocre tracks, they start with this one. I wanna shimmy shimmy shimmy till the break of dawn.<br />10/10<br />12) Toxicity: Their second single, and it's almost as good as their first.<br />10/10<br />13) Psycho: A very good song about groupies.<br />10/10<br />14) Aerials: A slow song, but still very good, with a hidden track of Armenian folk music or something like that.<br />10/10<br /><br />If it wasn't for a few tracks, this would've been as good as their \\"Self-titled\\" debut, but because they were on there, it wasn't quite as good.<br /><br />I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM COMPLETELY. BUT IF YOU'RE IDIOTIC ENOUGH TO JUST WANT A FEW TRACKS, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE FOLLOWING TRACKS:<br />\\"Prison Song\\", \\"Chop Suey!\\", \\"Bounce\\", \\"Shimmy\\" and \\"Toxicity\\".<br /><br />I give Toxicity a:<br />10 OUT OF 10: Perfect for anyone's metal collection.

B000003CM9|5.0|This is where the \\"classic Allmans sound\\" - blues mixed with rock, R&B, gospel, country, and bits of Latin and jazz - really started to take hold. In other words, it's their first mature work. And it's one of their best ever. This also began a longstanding Allmans tradition: including at least one lengthy, dramatic instrumental. The one in question is the jazzy In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, by far Dickey's best composition with the group. I know it's not the most original observation, but Duane lands one of the most intense guitar solos I've ever heard on this song, channeling John Coltrane. That part just explodes, serving as a nice contrast to Dickey's more tame (but still impressive) solo. Then there's Gregg's swirling organ parts, the brief drum solo, and theme. Dickey lifted this structure and applied it to Eat a Peach's Les Bres in A Minor (at least that song's second half) - Les Brers is quite good, but Liz Reed is far better. Anyway, Dickey's other song, the optimistic opener Revival, is another pick. The aforementioned gospel and folk influences really play a part in this song, which isn't blues at all. Always good to hear the group expanding. Another classic is Gregg's folky country-blues Midnight Rider. Again, listen for the slide solo, plus Gregg's rough lyrics about outlaw life.<br />The rest of the record shows the group falling back on the blues conventions on the first. But that's not an accusation - it's praise, since the blues is so good here. Nothing reaches the level of It's Not My Cross to Bear, but that doesn't matter - I'd rather hear the harmonica-and-slide Don't Keep Me Wondering or the wrenching, underrated sleeper Please Call Home than the debut's Black Hearted Woman, and I quite like Black Hearted Woman. And while the cover of Hoochie Coochie man doesn't top Muddy's original, what can? Good cover. My only quibble is Leave My Blues At Home. Not a bad song, good guitar weave during the fadeout in fact. But it's terribly average, and the only thing that keeps this from beating Eat a Peach as the Brothers' best studio album (Even then, it's their best \\"pure\\" studio album - Peach was, of course, half studio, half live).ng that keeps this from beating Eat a Peach as the Brothers' best studio album (Even then, it's their best \\"pure\\" studio album - Peach was, of course, half studio, half live).

B000EULJLU|5.0|admittedly if i had reviewed this the first few days i got the album, i would've torched it.  I guess thats how it works with bands who try something new.  Honestly I don't think this reaches the height of Tool's music - Aenima/Lateralus - but it is a very good album nonetheless;  Tool has become a much more progressive rock-sounding band with this release.<br /><br />Tracks- \\"vicarious\\" is probably the best song on the album.  It's intro sounds very much like the stuff off of lateralus, but it soon falls into the distortive riffs we expect from these guys. MJK's voice has changed with age, it seems, as this track has him singing with a breathier, raspier sound.  Later in the album it becomes more recognizable.  Danny/Adam/Maynard do a great job of syncing their works together as they normally do, especially on this track, all with Justin's bass in the background.  10/10<br /><br />\\"Jambi\\" is another one of the good tracks, and I thought it was interesting how they could make such a good sounding track using mostly open strings for the guitar. Pay close attention, its cool how Adam uses different rhythms to disguise the simplicity of the guitar.  9/10<br /><br />\\"Wings for Marie\\"- alot of people like this one, but I find it somewhat disjointed when it randomly shifts to a single riff that sounds completely different from the mellow, enlightened tones the song puts forth  6/10<br /><br />\\"10,000 Days\\" is one of my favorite songs.  I think many people dont appreciate how much of himself MJK put into this album, its a beautiful song lyrically, and the 11 minutes doesnt seem drawn out.  9/10<br /><br />\\"The Pot\\"-  another good song on the album, really revealing that MJK still has an elegant, yet powerful command of his vocals (he opens the song with a high pitched voice resembling the stuff of Mars Volta). Nothing lacking here in guitar bass or drums, tho Danny isn't as prevalent as he is in Vicarious.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />\\"Lipan Conjuring\\" Nothing to say here, its filler, but i think it sounds cool.<br /><br />\\"Lost Keys\\"- another \\"filler\\" track, but it does segue into Rosetta Stoned so unlike Lipan it does seem to serve a purpose.  Basically some guy shows up at a hospital, and somethings happened to him, the doctor asks whats wrong, and in Rosetta he explains the situation.<br /><br />\\"Rosetta Stoned\\" -  I think this is 10,000 Days \\"third eye\\", but I do not think it is as good.  The lyrics are rather simple, but that could be because of who the speaker of the words is supposed to be, a witness to an ET sighting, so i guess its understandable, being so rattled, that he doesnt use the best most elegant language.  Overall though i think this song drags on and i didnt get the same feel as i did with 10,000 days, or prior releases Reflection, or Third Eye.  THis song probly should've ended after the words \\"But I forgot my pen......\\" to \\"typical\\", but im no one to tell them how to do this.<br /><br />6/10<br /><br />\\"Intension\\"- very few words, and softly sung, so this definitely has a lateralus feel to it.  ultimately i dont listen to this track very often, its not worth it.<br /><br />5/10<br /><br />\\"Right in Two\\"  very good song, the ending is probably the best part, which sort of closes off the album.  its a shame they had to put in the next track, all filler, which sort of interrupts the closure you get from this song.  9/10<br /><br />\\"Viginti Tres\\"- filler, see above<br /><br />Ultimately this album is definitely worth the buy, it definitely recalls to a Lateralus sound.  I think its a shame Aenima and Undertow's anger and sheer power in the guitar and vocals is somewhat lacking, but the band has definitely shown an ability to grow.  10,000 Days is not like any other Tool album.

B00000HZH7|5.0|Out of the Metal world comes this masterpiece of an album known as Seven Churches by none other than Possessed. This is arguably the FIRST Death Metal album to ever be released. There is a long standing debate on whether Metalheads think that Death's Scream Bloody Gore was the very first Death Metal album instead of Seven Churches. The problem is that they get their band histories all messed up. While both bands formed in the same year (1983) and Death released their first demo in that time, Death's first demo ironically did not create Death Metal. It was Possessed's first demo that, released in the following year, paved the way for the genre. After a few more demos, Possessed created this album in 1985.    This album is considered Death/Thrash instead of pure Death Metal because the guitars sound more Thrashy than Death. However, Jeff Becarra, who is the vocalist, started the first known death grunts in this album albeit they don't sound that deep as most DM bands of the present time. The drums also featured the first \\"blastbeats\\" recorded in this album even though it is not up to the caliber of most other DM bands nowadays. This is, however, by no means an overrated album nor is Possessed overrated in general.    So the songs. Well, almost all of them are excellent but Satan's Curse is the weakest of the line-up. However, it is still a good song in its own right. The solos are well-executed even for those new to Death Metal. The best song in Seven Churches is the genre title track Death Metal. With an anthem of \\"Now we take over and rule by Death Metal, enjoy our long-wanted reign\\", you know you'll love the genre when you hear it.    There are countless numbers of DM bands that try to sound interesting with their semi-impressive music, be it Brutal Death Metal or Gothenburg-style Death Metal, etc., but none of them are as good as Possessed or even the Floridian Death Metal bands such as Death, Obituary, Morbid Angel, or Malevolent Creation. Death's Scream Bloody Gore can't even top this one off even though that Freeman guy thinks it can, which I know is false.    So, if you love Death Metal but don't have this CD, or if you are new to the genre, get this album now. Unless you do, you are not considered a true Death Metalhead, even if you decide to buy or have bought Death's Scream Bloody Gore and think it is better than this album. Seven Churches is not for the faint of heart (i.e. Nu-Metal, Pop, R&B, Rap/Hip-Hop, modern Rock, and \\"lovey-dovey\\" listeners, and Heavy and Power Metalheads).    A definite must-have.     99/100      Oh, and some more last words. Primus fans (who know Larry LaLonde {LaLonde was in Possessed before he joined Primus}), if you don't like this, f*** off! (especially to that asinine reviewer who says this album sucks.)    EDIT: to the person two reviewers above me: my goodness, you are an absolute moron. Might I remind you that this band created Death Metal, especially starting off with this album? You rate Death's Scream Bloody Gore as a masterpiece and yet you say that DM bands are a joke. I hope that you get burned by white phosphorus after concluding your point on this album and Death Metal, you pathetic excuse for a \\"Metalhead.\\"
B000002KIE|3.0|For my money, since 1977, England has been the most dominant country not only for punk rock bands, but for bands in general (The Smiths, The Clash, and Joy Division - all UK outfits - are probably my three favorite bands of all time)  The punk wave of the late 1970's gave us the following bands from the U.K.:  The Clash, Buzzcocks, Rezillos, The Damned, Souxie and the Banshees, Generation X, the Undertones, and the Sex Pistols among others.   <br /> <br />In terms of originality, I don't know how anyone could possibly say that the Sex Pistols were very original.  They basically combined a gruely Alice Cooper hedonism with the New York style (which they tried to distance themselves from, notably on their song New York).  I credit guitarist Steve Jones and Producer Chris Thomas for making the album listenable, but seriously, if you are looking for something from this period that is better, I would suggest (1) The Clash Self-Titled UK LP/CD, or (2) their US LP/CD, or (3) The Buzzcocks SINGLES GOING STEADY album or anything of this period by the Rezillos, The Damned, or the Undertones. <br /> <br />I mean, maybe you would like this album if you don't like diversity (the album isn't very ambitious, even though Rotten claimed to be a fan of Ska and Reggae), but to me this has to be the most overrated band and album in history; right up there with Nirvana's NEVERMIND and Hole's LIVE THROUGH THIS as media-hyped, corporate fluff.  And contrary to what another reviewer said, the Sex Pistols were most certainly a marketing gimmick.  The were formed in Malcolm's Sex shop, but from day one it was to make money.  Even today, shirts and other memorabilia featuring the pathetic and talentless Sid Vicious reap millions of dollars annually exploiting the fact that the guy was a drug wasted heap of flesh who did wild and crazy things because of his dope addiction. <br /> <br />There were great bands that shook the system:  THE CLASH, DEAD KENNEDYS, D.O.A., MINOR THREAT, BLACK FLAG, MDC.  ANTI-FLAG is a great current example.  But I would purchase this album only if you see it in the bargain bins, or if you can burn it for free.  Okay.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|This recording is listenable for so many reasons.   Paul Simon is at the height of his powers in the midst of these wondefully exotic, clever, well constructed and well arranged pieces.       The instrumentation and instumentalists along with accompanying vocalists are outstanding.  The \\"backing\\" vocals are more accompanying vocals with rich textures further elevating the quality of the songs.  The soloing is subtle and perfectly in sync with the pieces. There is never a single self indulgent moment in any of the pieces. They convey such scenery.  The rhythms are sly, propulsive but never overpowering.     Paul Simon's voice is in fine form here.  Filled with subtleties as he is more vocalist than the singer songwriter.   He uses his voice better than he ever has.  He explores it's ability to bend and also it's lower registers.       The songs themselves are interesting with clever lyrics.  Story telling at it's height. Insightful, wistful, lusty, romantic and joyful all in turn within the span of these pieces.        Here it is, 2006 and this recording is as fresh now as it was back when it was released.   Not one of Paul Simon's best but one of the best multi-ethnic/world music recordings period.       Always fun and interesting to listen to.   One of the most visually beautiful covers on top of everything else.
9707704667|5.0|This is another terrific one from MVLL and something really new is that the style is totally different from most of his other novels, the story goes in a straight line to the end, no flashbacks or mixed dialogues among different characters in mixed places or times, it is just a straight tale but a superb one, this fact is important because it will surely content to most people who used to think that his novels were excessively complicated to allow a clear reading.<br /><br />Personally I believe that MVLL has been telling the stories as he has been feeling them, e.g. Conversation in the Cathedral is precisely that, as a conversation one tends to go by the branches and forgets the main line sometimes, however, all the facts help to construct a view of the story.<br /><br />Along these years MVLL has also been constructing with each of his novels a complex and a unique technique that probably he abandons now to tell a story from a very simple perspective coming from a simple character and why not to finally reach all kind of readers.<br /><br />I prefer not to take so much time doing what most people will do reviewing the story, I would just say that it is a lovely but real one (I liked more than Love in time of the Cholera of Garcia Marquez simply because it is just more realistic without a happy ending but with a more likely ending)<br /><br />This story basically deals with a man who loves a woman without conditions along all his life and even though he regrets his decisions and feelings he concludes that his only inner force comes from this weird love and moreover that the only reason to be alive is to believe that some day they will be together, the story occurs in different times and places all of them described masterfully by MVLL, we can almost see and smell Paris in the 60's, London in the 70's and the things that happened during those years.<br /><br />What I think is the most important fact of this novel is that MVLL used to have a debt with his public, heprobably never constructed before so rich a female character as he does with the Bad Girl in this novel, he didn't make it as well with the Aunt Julia nor with Flora Tristan and the other women in his novels, this character (the Bad Girl) is so rich and complex that shines itself, Bad Girl's intricate mind is finally almost comprehended at the end of the story when Ricardo can join all the pieces of her story and knows her father in Peru, well MVLL has just paid his debt.<br /><br />With this novel MVLL shows to the world that he possesses one of the widest horizons in the contemporaneous writing, after a very hard research work, he is able of telling a story based on himself as a school boy (La Ciudad y los Perros or Time of the Hero), of describing the most terrible \\"misunderstanding\\" in the Brazilian backlands during the XIX century (The War of the end of the world, for me one of his best two novels, the other is Conversation in the Cathedral), of telling vividly the story of one of the scariest dictators in the XX century (the superb Feast of the Goat), of telling the story of Gaugin and Flora Tristan and their search for \\"paradise\\" whatever it meant for them and now, with this extraordinary tale, of giving us an extraordinarily strong story about love but fundamentally about the human nature and the inevitable flow of time.<br /><br />I'm so tempted of writing an open letter to the Nobel's Academy to ask for him this year's Literature Nobel award, I cross my fingers to avoid the idea that like Borges he could die without win it, If someone wants to join my crusade just write to my e-mail.<br /><br />I wrote this comment in English but I read the novel in Spanish, I think it will be translated soon to the English.<br /><br />Enjoy this extremely nice reading.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|It's been a long, long, LOOOOOONG time coming, but finally the years of endless waiting have paid off. The REAL Final Fantasy movie is released! Of course, the real question burning in everyone's poor brains is, was it worth the insanely long wait? Beyond the hype (if there can be such a thing for a creature of this kind) does there lurk a GOOD movie? Yes. Oh yes.<br /><br />Children Laughing? Is this the end?!<br /><br />Okay, more than a few people (in fact probably most) who played Final Fantasy VII through to the end were massively disappointed by the ending. Like the terrible ending for KOTOR II: The Sith Lords, there was no closure whatsoever. So epilogue, no explanations of how everything ultimately ended, nada. Ouch. Every saga needs a good ending that wraps things up. The sequel is not really a stand-alone feature so much as an oh-so-necessary wrap-up that everyone was entitled to in the first place. What does this mean?<br /><br />First of all, it means this movie will not make a whole lot of sense if you've never played the game before. If you don't know who Sephiroth is, who Rufus is, who the heck Cloud and Aeris and Tifa are, you're going to be like a person opening up the last issue of Infinite Crisis or House of M from the local comic shop and expecting to understand what's going on. It ain't happening. Not that that's a bad thing necessarily. American movies as a whole waste WAY too much time explaining everything, rather than building on the universe that already exists (like good comics or video games do). In other words, if you've played the game before, you're going to love all the little touches and tributes in honor of what amounted to a cultural phenomenon: Final Fantasy VII.<br /><br />Second of all, none of that time-consuming backstory explaining (a quick wrap-up will do thank you very much) leaves lots of room for character interaction and animated action. And is there every action.<br /><br />Motorcycles and Materia and Animated Mayhem. Oh my!<br /><br />Everyone who's seen a trailer for this movie has gotten a taste of the animated glory to be found. As a friend of mine who was an animation student told me, SquareSoft has had problems in the past with making their animated human beings animate and move like real humans should, but all those problems are gone as of now. They look better than real people, the animation is perfect, and every scene of this movie is a spectacular treat for the eyes. If there was ever a movie that makes me think I need a better TV (yet again) this would be it.<br /><br />More than that though, the action scenes are the kind of over-the-top sword-slashing, power-sliding, acrobatic eye-candy that everyone's been craving in their summer flicks, but haven't had since George Lucas last laid on the movie cheese. I could try to describe the movie scene by scene, but you really should see this one for yourself. Oh, and you'll love the motorcycle chase later in the film. Guaranteed.<br /><br />The Fantasy Remixed<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention the music? I went into this movie expecting quite a bit musically. I'm one of those crazed gamers who downloads all the remixes off the net, who's got the Final Fantasy Concert cd, and who could probably name where ever piece of music in the game is taken from in the game. I am here to tell you that this movie has the best soundtrack I've heard in an action movie possibly ever. There are orchestral versions of epic themes, piano versions of individual themes, and techno-rock remixes of battle themes. You might think that mixing three types of music like that would end up a jumbled mess, but instead it manages both to do justice to the genius of one of the greatest composers in Japan AND provide a beautiful, touching, moving, score that has plenty of bite. I own the soundtrack actually...<br /><br />And so he takes sword in hand once again...<br /><br />And then there a friend of mine who said that no matter how great the visuals, you getused to them after a while and there has to be some substance. In other words, there has to be a story and some interesting performances to make a good movie. Thank goodness this one does not disappoint.<br /><br />Sure, there's a new cast of villains bent on yet another \\"reunion\\", a new infection cause by Jenova, and lots great tribute moments to be found, but the REAL story here is not the revival of Sephiroth, it's the redemption of Cloud's soul. The death of Aeris is one of those video game events that EVERYONE knows about (like Mario fighting Bowser or Ganondorf stealing the Tri-Force). And her death was the last straw that made Cloud decide to hunt down and kill Sephiroth. But you just know...after letting her die there's no way Cloud could forgive himself.<br /><br />In a series of flashbacks, memories, and dialogs with Aeris in his own mind, the real conflict of the movie is brought to the fore, fought, and ultimately resolved, giving the longed-for closure that the game never got. This story is ultimately about Cloud moving on, and learning to forgive himself. It makes for an ending that is SOOOOO satisfying.<br /><br />There's only two things I wish were different about this movie, and they're both musical. First of all, the awesome piano remix of the Overworld theme from Final Fantasy VII found in the version of the film shown at the Venice Film Festival is missing, and so is the single most recognizable piece of music in the whole Final Fantasy repertoire, The Prelude. There's something magical about that piece (in fact it's my favorite piece of music in the world, not just from video games), and it really would have made my decade to have an orchestral version. Ah well, perhaps in the next Final Fantasy movie...at the visuals, you get used to them after a while and there has to be some substance.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is probably one of the best comedies to come out in recent years. It isn't your conventional comedy though. Most of the characters in the movie are extremely strange and are social outcasts. The humor is mostly deadpan instead of charasmatic and wacky. It is probably the most popular among teens even though most teens probably don't relate with Napoleon or anyone else in the movie. It's a very different kind of movie which probably helps contribute to its popularity. <br /> <br />The movie really doesn't have a story. It's basically just about Napoleons everyday life. Napoleon Dynamite is an outcast. Most nerds usually have other nerdy friends but Napoleon doesn't even have those until a new Hispanic student named Pedro arrives. He also becomes friends with a girl named Deb. His life becomes even more miserable with the arrival of his Uncle Rico who constantly screws up things for Napoleon. He stays with Napoleon and his thirtysomething year old brother Kip while their grandma recovers from and accident at the sand dunes. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is played by Jon Heder, who turns in one the best comedic performances of all time. He makes Napoleon depressed, nerdy and very unlikable. Hes not the kind of person you would wanna hang out with but somehow you root for him throughout the movie. There is something appealing about him thats hard to put a finger on. Hes a unique, memorable, and very quotable character that's not easy to forget. <br />Aaron Ruell plays Napoleons even nerdier brother Kip. He's not as relaxed as Napoleon and he spends all day chating online with his internet girlfriend when hes not helping Uncle Rico sell tupperware. Efren Ramirez plays Pedro. He always has a blank look on his face and is even more out of it than Napoleon. Jon Gries plays Uncle Rico. Hes probably the most annoying character in the movie. Hes constantly looking for ways to make money and wishes he could relive his college football days. Tina Majorino plays Deb, Napoleon's potential girlfriend. She looks nerdy in the movie but is actually very cute in real life. All in all the whole cast does excellent work making the characters what they need to be for the movie to work. <br />There is nothing really offensive in the movie to it's probably ok to let your kids see it. <br />It's a unique movie that, like Napoleon himself, you won't soon forget. <br />
B00005UP86|5.0|This is the finest depiction of the day to day horror and nobility of 20th century warfare ever made. The cinematography is excellent, the plotline is taken from the most accurate history books, and the characters are real people, both good and bad.
0060012358|5.0|This is not a book for kids who like \\"once upon a time Mr. Bunnsy went into the Dark Woods\\" kind of books- but this is a book for kids who like books about stupid-looking boys who play a mean penny whistle, money-minded cats with grand schemes, and talking rats who practically worship a book about Mr. Bunnsy going into the Dark Woods. This is also a book for grown-ups who love to read intelligent books for kids that might get those kids or even those adults thinking a little differently about how they treat rats and, more importantly, each other.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|ok... so my friend told me about P!ATD back in like october, and when i first listened to them i was like they sound just like Fall Out Boy. so then i went and forgot about them for a while and then one day i was just watchin t.v. and the video for \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies\\" came on and i was like this is the s**t. so i went out and got this cd which is one of the best cd's i've ever heard. my favorite songs are \\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines\\", \\"Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks\\", \\"Camisado\\" (but i like the demo version much better; this version is still great), \\"There's A Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet\\", and \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\". that's pretty much half the cd which is saying something if those are my FAVORITE songs and not just the ones that i listen to religously (like the entire cd). the thing that i love most about the album is the song titles. i love how they're soooo long that when you tell somebody the name of the song its like youre telling a short story. anyway if you like different music and if you like Fall Out Boy then you should definitly get this album. even if you dont like FOB and you just like kind-of emo music you should get this. you know what just get the CD!!!!
B00005JOVH|5.0|Since so many of these reviews are less than stellar I'll add my two-bits as an alternate opinion.  This was one of my favorite films so far this year.  Nearly everything about it works.  As a comic book action flick it is the type of film that will keep me coming back for more.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris is not the new Madalyn Murray O'Hair.  Unlike O'Hair, Harris is dispassionate, compellingly logical, and devasatatingly accurate.<br /><br />Unfortunately most of the happy-face, go-to-church-on-Sunday, God-loves-me crowd will never read this book.  But at least it's a start.<br /><br />Excellent.
B00005JOHC|5.0|This show is a not to be missed program.  I have loved it since it's first show.  The entire cast make a great ensemble, working off of one another in great comedic timing.  I have checked after every season to see if they will begin selling the DVD, I am sorry they have not yet made the series for public sale.  I hope when they do, they put all of the current seasons on DVD and sell all of them in a boxed set.  My vote would be a resounding yes for getting the DVD's out to the public.  Thank You.
B000002J2B|5.0|This album may be a sleeper, but this is the best album, besides Trick of the Tail, with Phil Collins as vocalist. All of the tracks are nothing short of fantastic. In that Quiet Earth stands out fromthe pack. As far as i know, this is the last album guitarist Steve Hackett performed on. His touch to this album, was what made this album great.The song Blood ON the Rooftops is a masterpiece. Too bad it will never make it on a best of Genesis album! All and all, this is a must have for those who want to here great musicians make great work. Instead of Invisible Touch, GET A REAL GENESIS ALBUM!!!!!!!
B00068ULLY|4.0|A)it was not made for California Mountain Snake but for Black Mamba B)at this point CMS was nervous - and in a trailer with limited moving space, fighting a more motivated attacker (with better skills - you cannot assume that because you are both using swords that your opponent will only use swords -  assuming you wish to survive anyway.
0156027321|4.0|LIFE OF PI is one of my wife's favorite books, which is why I read it.  I enjoyed it very much.  It is very well written and engaging, but in the end, I didn't find it especially moving or memorable.  Well constructed, yes.  Creative, yes.  Worth reading, yes.  Great, no. <br /> <br />(My last Booker Prize winner was THE BLIND ASSASSIN by Margaret Atwood--also Canadian; LIFE OF PI was a big improvement!)
B000002HMH|4.0|i do not understand why everyone keeps running this album and reload into the ground so bad.  after reading many reviews people repeatedly say that metallica lost their edge and \\"sold out\\", etc...so you dont like hero of the day?  and until it sleeps?  or king nothing?  those songs are great and they still rock.  metallica's sound did change, but for the better.  kill em all and ride the lightning you can barely understand what hetfield is saying...more like screaming instead of singing.  i thought they just kept getting better with their peak being their black album.  cant understand they hype around master of puppets either...its a good album but not their best.
0618477942|5.0|Alison Bechdel sets a new standard for the autobiographical graphic novel, with a complex and layered narrative, and drawings that are expressive, intricate, and often charming (charm being something she may or may not cop to).     As someone who mentioned Watergate in my diary aged 11, her evocation of growing up in the 1970's was wonderfully recognizable.
0064471047|4.0|I didn't read this book when I was younger, but I enjoyed it very much! I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie and I just fell in love with the characters. It was a pretty quick read and the ending was spectacular. Highly recommended~
0618477942|5.0|A lot of Fun Home was way over my head and it took a certain dedication to contend with words like \\"postlapsarian\\" and cerebral personal parallels with great classics I've never read.  Which really seemed to highlight the intimate, authentic, organic tone of Alison's story. Unlike many reviewers, I took my time and savored it for the fantastic artistry.  Sometimes I would flip back and casually review each page, looking for details I missed, never in a hurry. Everyone should own this book.  I guarantee you've never seen one like it.
B0006IF92U|5.0|This charming lady may be very beautiful and have a wonderful voice, but by this stage of her career she had fallen in with the odious Mr McFadden from Boyzone. Unfortunately, his influence can be seen in this somewhat disappointing follow up to Innocent Eyes. I've a good mind to deduct Miss Goodrem some stars to teach her a lesson, but I can't bring myself to do it.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|i've been listening to the chili peppers for years and i have to say this stands out as an exemplar record.  'by the way' consisted of tightly-crafted tunes and, as all of their releases, has stemmed from a high level of musicianship.  but this album finds the band reconnecting in ways it has not for a long time.  the funk is back.  and it's effortless.  it IS old school and those that don't appreciate better look elsewhere.  don't look before 1980.  thank you flea. john. anthony. chad.
B000088DTS|5.0|I first spotted this charming young lady in the TV show Neighbours and she proved she's not only a pretty face but also a wonderful actress and a great singer. This album is wonderful from start to finish with no weak tracks. One day I hope to meet Miss Goodrem to tell her how good her album is.
0440237688|5.0|Jonas was born into a perfect community.  In a society where there is no unemployment, criminals, or poor people.  Everything is perfect, and everyone is happy.  In this world people are assigned to their spouse, and children are assigned to couples if the Committee of Elders believes the couple is qualified.  All families in this community consist of a mother, a father, a male child, and a female child.  Once a person in the community gets too old they move to the House of Elders, where they live until they are \\"released\\" from the community.  A person can also file for \\"release\\" if he or she no longer wants to continue to live in the community.   <br />      This year Jonas will become twelve years old.  Becoming twelve is an important year for all children within this society.  It is important because that is the year when all the \\"twelves\\" receive notice of their occupations in the community and begin their training.  The Committee of Elders decides the careers for each child that will turn twelve in that year at a ceremony performed in front of the entire community.  Jonas is given his job title last.  He is assigned to be the Receiver of Memory, which is the most important job within the community.   His job is to receive the memories held by The Giver in order for Jonas to become The Giver of Memory himself someday.  His training is secretive and can be painful or pleasurable.  The Giver transfers his memories of all things including love, color sensation, sledding in the snow, and war.  Memories such as war can cause Jonas to have pain.  On the other hand memories like sledding can be exciting for Jonas. <br />      Jonas' training will take much time to be completed because there are an abundance of memories to be transferred.  The purpose of The Giver is to hold all the memories so the people of the society do not have to experience the bad memories or have the burden of holding memories.  For instance, Jonas training is dramatic and he grows wiser.Jonas realizes there is more to life than just the community where Jonas lives.  The author has shaped a creative plot that is fascinating and intriguing due to the creative plot with the concept of one person holding all the memories for everyone within a community. <br />      Written for young adults, The Giver convoys a positive and outgoing mood due to the fact that the society in which Jonas lives is protected and perfect.  That memories are valuable and precious is a central theme in this book.  It is important for people to experience a great variety of things and cherish their memories and experiences.
B00006AG5N|3.0|I first discovered Mr Presley when he released the excellent JLX mix of a Little Less Conversation (Radio Edit). Unfortunately not all of his work is up to that standard. Songs like Jailhouse Rock and Love Me Tender sound like something from the fifties, though other songs like Let Me Be Your Teddy Bear are pleasant enough. Verdict: Worth a punt
0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is set in a small town in Alabama called Maycomb. This book is told in first person through a young girl named Scout's eyes. Scout's dad, Atticus is a lawyer who is fighting for a black man accused of rape. Scout notices how all of her white neighbors think of Atticus and the black person he is defending. This perspective shows how cruel, racist, and unjust this small town in Alabama really is, and how it seems her family is the only white family to notice. She is taunted by her fellow acquaintances and everyone teases her about her family, and especially her dad.  Her family must cope through many different people with all the same opinion, in order to achieve justice. This influential book shows both how atrocious and great human nature can be. I really enjoyed this book, and the powerful message that it conveys. I thought all of the characters were likeable in all different areas, no matter how mean they appeared. This book showed me just how much human nature can both help and tear apart even the smallest community, and only with knowledge can communities be mended.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Apart from the fact that this show's lead actors, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles are easy on the eye, this show has been written in a way that will appeal to many.   <br /> <br />Jared and Jensen are two extremely talented actors who give the characters of Sam and Dean the life they deserve.  Jensen's one-liners are pure genious, and give the show a constant but not overbearing comic relief.  The characters are not as simple as they come across at first sight.  Dean (Jensen Ackles) especially, has a lot of layers.  At first sight, a smartass with quick one-liners and a burning desire to kill anything and everything evil and supernatural, there is also a deeply caring and loyal side to him, that Jensen portrays beautifully.  Jared does a brilliant job of portraying the reluctant sibling who simply wants a 'normal' life, but is also passionate about tracking down his father and finding and killing the demon that murdered their mother. <br /> <br />Each episode gives a little more information and insight into the Winchester brothers and their family.  At the end of each episode, you can't wait till the next one, knowing that within it will lie yet another peace of valuable information about these brothers' journey.   <br /> <br />Once you've watched the first episode, I guarantee you won't sleep until you've seen the whole Season!
B000F0UV0E|4.0|This is a straightforward album, what you hear is what you get. I liked this album the first time through, and liked it better as I heard more of it. But overall it just doesn't have the depth of, say, MK's Shangri-La (which I shamefully underrated), and it falls short of a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Two great artists (actually three if you count MK's guitar playing) have come together to produce a very friendly album. Emmylou Harris' voice is the first treat you encounter, emotion in every word, and Mark Knopfler's voice still has that unique bear-growl character. They don't blend quite seamlessly, but I'm too familiar with both to care. It's great to hear them together. EH is probably the single best part of the album, but there are too many good points to really single her out. <br /> <br />The musical style varies nicely, from an almost-rocker or two to ballads to straight country, and an mix of instruments to match. \\"Red Staggerwing\\" is an entertaining and upbeat fiddle/dance tune. \\"Donkey Town\\" is a country song about an odd love triangle? \\"Rolling On\\" is a light rocker that you might have found on MK's \\"Golden Heart\\" album (which IS a masterpiece by the way). The title track is my current favorite, and \\"If This Is Goodbbye\\" is a close second. This is also the song where MK's guitar is most alive. A few other cuts have familiar and simple fill-ins, nice to hear, but this is a duet album, not a guitar album. The songwriting varies, but both of EH's cuts (\\"Love And Happiness For You\\" and \\"Belle Star\\") are great, and MK hits about 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />So overall, the songs range from great to pretty good, and while the album is very listenable (as the other reviewers' enthusiasm shows), it falls short of being a masterpiece. Still, EH and MK fans will definitely find a lot to like.
B00026WU3M|4.0|The production is pretty lush for a Dylan album.  Maybe too lush for most.  I like the tunes though, I'd like to hear a [...] kickin' live version of \\"Everything is Broken.\\"  I bought this on vinyl (!) but only recently got the CD version.  I'm glad I did.  It's a keeper.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I must confess that the only reason that I saw this film in the theatre is because \\"Brokeback Mountian\\" was sold out and this little film was the only one starting within 30 minutes, thankfully so because it gave me a chance to see what is honestly one of the best movies I have seen of the decade, it's smart, witty, as well as tearjerking. It's controversial, powerful yet comical screenplay was near flawless. Every single part of the film was over average if not better everything from the little thing like the music, (which was great espeacially dolly Parton's \\"Travelin thru\\") all the way to the superb acting. Obviously Felicity Huffmans performance portraying the transgender uptight middle-aged woman Bre was an extremely memorable to say the least, honestly her performance in this little feature was one of the top 5 I have probably ever seen... also one thing that I though was ver overlooked was Kevin Zeger's performance of Bre's Hustler druggie son Toby, he really nailed that part in my opinion for a great all around job.<br /><br />This Remarkable film, along with \\"Brokeback Mountian\\", \\"Capote\\", \\"Crash and even \\"Munich\\" really deliver some new and really good new things that I believe to set a path for a new breed of contoversial film that I love to see. \\"Transamerica\\" along with the other films that I named really take a huge step in making Hollywood as well as America as a whole alot closer to accepting new people, lifestyle's as well as way of thinking. I think it's really great that this years Oscar nominated films all provide some new great examples of this new form of controversial film.
0060920084|2.0|I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed. <br />     Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book. <br />      <br />First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc. <br />    <br />Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.  <br />      <br />There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in \\"In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.  <br />     <br />In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent.
B000024D4R|5.0|If you're not a serious listner of prog, this album is not for you. It is a slightly difficult album to understand if you're not able to understand the sarcasm created by metaphoric language and also not able to relate music and lyircs.  <br /> <br />But if you're able to to the above two, you'll understand why Pink Floyds are the Gods of prog and why this album is easily their second best (after DSOTM).
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Early trailers for Wolfgang Peterson's \\"Troy\\" claimed the movie would be based off Homer's Iliad.  If your interest in this movie is piqued by this claim you're in for an unpleasant surprise.  The Homeric epic and this movie have little in common.  For example, in the movie the war lasts for two weeks.  The epic sets the characters in the final year of a decade-long war of attrition.  Comparing the gravity of the two representations is like comparing the US conflicts in Bosnia and Vietnam.    The epic is populated by a host of Greek deities, who plot and conspire against each other.  The Hellenic mythology surrounding the war, combined with the human conflict on the ground and the backdrop of good-old-fashioned bronze age carnage, is what makes the story so important to western culture.  The excavations of German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in the late 19th century confirm that there were many Troys, each one built on top of the ruins of its predecessor.  It also confirms that any actual Trojan conflict would have been minor and unimportant in terms of the struggle between Persia and Greece.  In other words, without the hyperbole and myth of the Iliad, you don't have much to work off of.  Peterson's movie drains the story of all of Homer's poetic liberties, both secularizing and inflating the conflict's dimensions until the movie is ready to burst and flutter about the screen in an obscene fart pattern.    For starters, the romance between Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) is nonexistent.  Accounts differ on whether Helen was abducted by force or voluntarily emigrated.  Given the lack of chemistry between the two actors, combined with the lack of skepticism-staying plausibility in their relationship (Helen admits that their relationship is a mistake in her first scene, only to leave with Paris almost immediately afterwards), Peterson should have opted for forceful abduction.  Instead, he makes Helen's husband, King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) a lecherous bigot no one will root for.  In short, Paris' chief virtue is that he isn't Menelaus.   Also, he looks nothing like Brendan Gleeson (who plays a bit of an eyesore).    And then there's Brad Pitt as Achilles.  Not much can be said of this performance.  He plays a narcissistic, uncharismatic piece of meat that is good at killing people.  His acting talents are not used.  In fact, any underwear model could have played the part.  The Iliad opens with a feud between Achilles and Agamemnon (chief commander of the Greek forces, played in the movie by Brian Cox).  Agamemnon demands Achilles give up one of his wives, seized forcefully but presumably cared for, as tribute to him.  Achilles grudgingly gives up his wife Bresies (Rose Byrne in the movie) and refuses to continue fighting.  This conflict is so inadequately translated into movie form it may as well have been another in a series of large omissions.  In the movie, Bresies is just a captured Trojan that Achilles knows for about ten minutes before Agamemnon takes her from him.  It's hard to believe a warrior with Achilles' resolve would \\"sail the wine dark sea\\" to Troy, take part in a daring initial offensive, and then abandon the campaign for this comparatively inane offense.  Peterson apparently doesn't think so.    The battles are just large groups of computer generated soldiers running into each other and dying by the bushel.  They're nothing you haven't seen in better form in Gladiator or Braveheart (which also had better stories and acting).  King Priam of Troy is played by Peter O' Toole, who does a great job with what little he has to deliver.  He's in a lot of battle-reaction shots looking concerned.  Many of the exchanges in battle depend on a sudden suspension of activity that aren't explained.  Why do soldiers stop fighting so Achilles can mourn his best friend (and presumed homosexual partner) Patroclus?  Forget it.  If you made it that far you're either numbed to the inconsistencies, toodisgusted to care, or too dense to notice them.    I don't recommend this as either an adaptation of The Iliad or a good action packed battle movie.  Nothing this movie does well isn't done better in many other movies.  It's a shame there won't be a good adaptation now that this movie came out for many years.  This was a tremendous waste of a heafty A-list cast.  Don't waste your money.
0316666343|5.0|This book was absolutely delightful in a morbid sort of way. Alice Sebold describes heaven to us and shows us what its like there. It shows that once you're there, you really don't want to be. Also, like many of the other readers, I thought that the ending started to lose its touch, but the book was still extremely wonderful. Alice Sebold has a way with words that you'll adore! I couldn't stop reading this book...
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought John Mayer's Room for Squares CD almost three years ago, and I still listen to it all the time.  It's one of those CD's that's always in my CD player whether I'm spring cleaning, exercising, or just relaxing.  First of all, I love the sound of John Mayer's voice.  I don't think I've ever heard a better sounding male singing voice in my life.  What really makes these songs great is the combination of John's voice with his guitar.  I can honestly say that when listing my favorite songs, I want to list them all.  But if I had to choose, I would say my favorite songs on this CD are Why Georgia, City Love, Back to You, and Great Indoors, mostly because of the lyrics and catchy melodies.  I also love the guitar solos on this album, especially in Neon.  The lyrics are definitely refreshing, being mostly about reminiscing on the sweet things of the past.  I think John Mayer is very talented, and I love his style.  I would also recommend his newer album, Heavier Things.
0975991477|5.0|In this book, Lipton, a biologist, discusses the idea that environment is more of a determinant of our development than our genes, because our genetic \\"keys\\" are only manipulated by the environment we develop in.  Therefore unlocking the \\"genetic code\\" of our DNA tells us less about ourselves than we would have hoped because people with identical genetics can turn out in many different ways depending on what happens in their lives.<br /><br />The analogy that occurred to me is that our genes are like piano keys, the DNA genetic code is like the musical score, and the pianist playing the keys is the environment, putting the tones together into unfolding music over time.<br /><br />Lipton suggests that as part of our \\"environment\\" we can mold our beliefs so that they will affect our cell biology, and that the \\"placebo effect\\" is a phenomenon that needs much more investigation as a potential tool in medical treatment and personal development.  (Our beliefs, if adopted by the subconscious as \\"true,\\" affect how our cells operate/develop and how our genetic keys are activated.)<br /><br />The author gets into a lot of speculation about religion and \\"mother earth\\" mysticism, but his ideas are quite interesting and should provide fruitful ground for future scientific research and philosophical speculation.  The book is very simple to understand and well illustrated.

B000ETRCMQ|3.0|Bree is suffering from a gender identity disorder (she was born a man, Stanley) and is one week away from the operation that is going to finally make her a real woman. Up until the surgery she's doing everything by the book: taking her hormones, practicing with voice tapes to speak in a more feminine tone, and speaking with her therapist to ensure that she's ready for the transition.  Everything is going well until she receives a call that Stanley's son (Toby) is in prison in New York and is calling his father to bail him out.  Thus begins the breakdown that sends Bree to her therapist's office to try to sort out the mess that has become her life.<br /><br />This film isn't as serious as it might seem and the transgender story plays second fiddle to that of a parent getting to know the son she didn't know existed.  It is compounded by the fact that Bree can't tell Toby that she's biologically his father, but she also can't turn her back on him.  Because her therapist won't consent to her sex change operation unless she makes an effort to get to know her son, Bree travels to New York to bail Toby out of jail.  Little does she know that he's been working as a hustler and has a drug problem.<br /><br />Bree decides to let Toby come with her on her journey across the country to be in LA in time for her sex change operation.  This gives them time to get to know each other and for Bree to try to talk Toby out of his intended LA career (porn star).  Along the way they meet many interesting characters including a peyote-eating hippie with ulterior motives, a Native American man with a crush on Bree, and Bree's family who has yet to see the physical changes she's undergone.<br /><br />Having seen none of the original reviews or trailers, I rented this film and hoped for the best.  I wasn't disappointed.  Also, even though Felicity Huffman is the one who was nominated for an Oscar, in my opinion it is Fionnula Flanagan (Bree's mother) who shines in every scene she's in.  Overall, I found the movie a lighthearted comedy that was well worth the time I spent viewing it.lighthearted comedy that was well worth the time I spent viewing it.
6305922756|4.0|\\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" is a fun satire.  It is as obvious as it is freewheeling, but it hits its bullseye and never stops.  Rob Reiner, who directed and was contributing writer to this extravaganza, plays the interviewer making a \\"Rockumentary\\" of the title named band from England.  The disparity between the interviews and the behind the scenes debacles is telling.  Mercilessly, the contradictions poke fun at the pretenses and the self-importance of a successful band hitting the skids.  There are also occasional flashbacks to earlier incarnations of the group and its music that parody different movements in rock history.  The songs, especially the lyrics, nail the music on its head.  \\"...Spinal Tap\\" does for heavy metal what \\"Nashville\\" does for country, except the songs are far better here.         The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, so we're seldom beat over the head, but it isn't breezy, either.  \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" is an infectious parody of heavy metal bands and a fun movie that makes it all seem so easy.
B00009MGR6|5.0|This album is very dear to me for two reasons: 1) it's from my favorite band, AC/DC, and 2) it was released January 1, 1988, the EXACT same day I was born. <br /> <br />1. Heatseeker - 10/10 - It's a bird! It's a plane! It' - a heatseeker! Brian Johnson boasts about needing no life preserver and needing no one to hose him down, about charging up the sky and burning up the town. <br /> <br />2. That's the Way I Wanna Rock N Roll - 10/10 - A foot-tapping delight. This is the song that gave this album its title: half-way through the song, Brian says he's going to \\"blow up my video, shut down radio, told bossman where to go, turned off my brain control.\\" I guess that's the way he likes to rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br />3. Meanstreak - 10/10 - I love this song simply because of its clever lyrics:  <br />I've found myself in Abu Dhabi, just a mirage in the night <br />But, I ain't seen nuthin' to get me off my ass <br />I could walk, yeah, 'fore I could crawl <br />I just don't know who I wanna be, the Count of Monte Cristo or the Sheik of Araby? <br />And I'm the perfect culture vulture in the face of poverty <br />And I always kick the castle that's been built up on the beach, haha! <br /> <br />4. Go Zone - 10/10 - I actually draw a connection with this track and \\"Ride On\\" from AC/DC's earlier years because it mentions a \\"red-light district.\\" <br /> <br />5. Kissin' Dynamite - 10/10 - A song about a woman who can kiss with the best of them. She's compared to a fireball in the shadow, a storm that's gonna show, an overwhelmed volcano, a thunder in the mountain, the lightning in the sky, and the eye of a tornado. <br /> <br />6. Nick of Time - 10/10 - The best I can summarize about this song is that its basically about: a fast train running late on the wrong track, bad blood and news about a rope with nothing to lose, a mad bull seeing red and charging, hoping to kill the singer; everybody trying to frame him and making him toe the line; a slow plane in a storm that leavesthe singer sweaty and strained, and then has to bail out of the plane into the black abyss below, the sound of the engine being the only thing he can hear, he counts ten and prays, asserting that the nick of time will save him anyday; everybody loves a hero who lives in danger; losing sleep, getting grief, getting no relief, being punched in the face for reasons you don't know, a mob chasing you like you were the Holy Grail in hopes of lynching you; everybody trying to frame him and making him toe the line <br /> <br />7. Some Sin for Nuthin' - 10/10 - In this song, Johnson declares that, while some sin for gold, some sin for shame, some sin for cash, some sin for gain, some sin for wine, and some sin for pain, he isn't going to be the fool who's going to have to sin for nothing. It also says that: heroes are hard to find because they don't make the news till they're doing time; shcemers turn the screw, get the word, and drop on you; dealers are looking around; the wheel is turning around; Nero was an evil man who was born way before his time; he led the Romans down below; you get it right and away you go; you have to lay down the rules, push up the price, turn on the heat, and put yourself on ice; don't sin for nothing, because you're getting nothing for nothing. <br /> <br />8. Ruff Stuff - 10/10 - I don't care what anyone else says about this song, it is very deep and almost remniscient of \\"You Shook Me All Night Long.\\" This is my favorite song on this album. Here is the story it tells: I like 'em big and I like 'em small. If I had to take the oath, I would take them all. Gimme that ruff stuff, it's what I want! She's a saint, she's a sinner, she's a rave, rave, rave! She's the one, she's a winner, in every way, way way! She don't want love, no cabaret that's out. She likes to play around. That suits me fine; I like it better when she reads my mind! And I don't want a woman with a ball 'n' chain, don't wanna play that game... just gimme that ruff stuff! I want ruff stuff! Baby, gimme ruff stuff! You don't want ruff stuff? Don't want your face around here! Make you shake, make you shiver, make you pray, pray, pray! Gonna make you quake, make you quiver, and turn you grey, grey, grey! I don't need brakes, they slow me down to much. They keep me out of touch. They lock me in. I like it better when I pull the pin! And I don't want a woman with a ball 'n' chain, don't wanna play that game... just gimme that ruff stuff! I want ruff stuff! Baby, gimme ruff stuff! You don't want ruff stuff? Don't want your face around here! I like them big and I like them small. And if they asked me to take an oath, oh, I would take them all. Gimme that ruff stuff... gimme that ruff stuff! I want ruff stuff! Baby, gimme ruff stuff! Gimme more ruff stuff! Whoa, ruff stuff, baby! Baby, gimme ruff stuff, yeah! Takin' all the ruff stuff! I want it, yeah! Don't want your face 'round here, I said... don't want your face 'round here... oh, I don't want your face 'round in my backyard anymore! <br /> <br />9. Two's Up - 10/10 - Basically, it's Brian Johnson's version of \\"Sin City.\\" <br /> <br />10 This Means War - 10/10 - The name says it all.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I just got this a couple days ago, Ive wanted it for quite a while and Im happy to say it was worth the wait. This is one of the best concert dvds you will EVER BUY, Im serious! Some highlights of the first disc are I cant quit you baby, Dazed and Confused, Moby Dick and Whole Lotta Love the second disc has Black Dog Misty Mountain Hop Going to California Stairway to Heaven Rock and Roll Achilles Last Stand and Kashmir Im only 14 and some of todays music is good but people dont realize that the 60's and 70's had some awesome music and this dvd is proof of that, I recomend it to anyone into rock or anyone who just wants something to watch and listen to.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is Tool's 2001 release that, in my opinion, is neck and neck with Ænima. Both are strongly progressive in nature and some label it as Tool's best work. Some though still think Ænima is best, as I do, others say Lateralus. Personally, I think both have characteristics that make one just as great as the other. Lateralus is probably the most progressive album. Laced with a moody, sometimes spacey atmosphere that takes the listener on a journey through the human psyche. This one probably takes the cake as best flowing album. Each track moving in an out of one another as if the entire cd was one big song. Very pinkfloydish. The songs themselves are also very detailed and the lyrical content is just astounding. \\"Reflection\\" happens to be right up on my list as one of my all time favorites. Danny Carey's drumming really shines in this one too. I have, below, rated all the songs except the segues...<br /><br />1. The Grudge - 9.5/10<br />3. The Patient - 10/10<br />5. Schism - 10/10<br />7. Parabola - 10/10<br />8. Ticks & Leeches - 9.5/10<br />9. Lateralus - 10/10<br />10. Disposition - 9/10<br />11. Reflection - 10/10<br />12. Triad - 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 97% A<br /><br />This album, surprisingly, is another masterpiece after such a long wait between it and Ænima. Many were worried that the band itself might have lost it due to their downtime but they had not. If anything, they had gotten better. This is truly an album of mass proportions.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Before hearing Stadium Arcadium I was not a RHCP fan but I've always been a fan of Clear Vocals with creative melody lines and perfect harmonies. I am fan of unique original bass lines. I am especially a fan of modern guitar riffs with plenty of different guitar tones. Stadium Arcadium delivers the goods on every song... All the songs are good but there are 6 songs that make SA a 5 star Masterpiece. The First Masterpiece is \\"Especially in Michigan\\"...The guitar riffs and feedback is brilliant...listen closely. The 2nd Masterpiece is C'mon Girl, Flea's bass line is so cool. This song is very dynamic, it starts off mellow, changes tempo and builds, I love the melodic guitar feedback during the first cool solo. The 3rd Masterpiece is \\"Tell me Baby\\"... Kindy Funk, Kindy Rap...just listen, you'll love it. I love the perfect drum beat during the chorus. \\"21st Century\\" has got the Absolute Groove...this song just Rocks and is the 4th Masterpiece. \\"Make you feel better\\" is a total Summer Song...an UpTempo Feel Good Song.\\"Turn it Again\\" has a unique Time signature with jazzy guitar chords and then switches to uptempo rock guitar riffs perfectly...The Guitar solo at the end takes off and really rocks hard...    All the other songs on Stadium Arcadium are very good...I've got to check out all the other RHCP albums now. Stadium Arcadium will win a Grammy for Rock Album of the Year!
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days is Tool's newest album and I must say it's another awesome release. Tool always gives us great music to listen to even if we have to wait 5 years to hear it. Now I wouldn't call this release better than Ænima or Lateralus. I just don't think the songs are as good. Not that the songs are bad, I mean this does have really great songs, just not the best. That's my viewpoint at least. Some though may hate it or love it because it is pretty much a sidestep from what we are used too. A lot of people expected so much from this new release that it caused many people to be shocked when the heard the album for the first time. I myself was shocked at first. I admit it, but the album did grow on me and I do think it is an excellent release. It's another pretty moody album, I'd have to say it's probably the most moody album. It's actually can be pretty calming at times. The only thing I found wrong with it is that some of the songs just seemed to fail to climax. \\"Jambi\\" for instance is a great song but it just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Despite all this here are my ratings... (minus the segues)<br /><br />1. Vicarious - 9.5/10<br />2. Jambi - 8.5/10<br />3. Wings For Marie (Pt 1) - 9/10<br />4. 10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) - 8.5/10<br />5. The Pot - 10/10<br />8. Rosetta Stoned - 10/10<br />9. Intension - 9/10<br />10. Right In Two - 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 93% A-<br /><br />Anyway, 10,000 Days is another solid release from Tool. All fans of the band should surely go out and purchase the album. I'm sure most of them will be happy with it.
0312995423|3.0|Ever since Da Vinci Code I expected Dan Brown to thrill me more and more. Unfortunately, this is not one of his best books.  Angels and Demons was a lot better than this one. The story is good, but the thrill is missing. If I can recommend one other writer, that would be Simon Cleveland. In my opinion, he is the only one that can stand opposite Mr. Brown with his good writing and exception story telling.
B000002MUW|4.0|I  bought this when it came out and it is one of my favorite Madonna albums.  The cover says it all.  Originally it came with a powder blue CD tray which matched the color of the CD.  The songs here are intimate and remind me of something Madonna herself would play while putting on her make up and getting ready for the evening.  I also bought all of the remix maxi-singles that came out with each single release and loved them all, especially take a bow, and the secret maxi single.

B0000029GA|5.0|Let's all slow down and look at Nas's Illmatic in retrospect. The year was 1994, and a 20 year-old emcee out of Queensbridge, NY delivers arguably the greatest 40 minutes in hip-hop history. Every single track on this album is a classic. There is no filler, there is no waste of space. On this album, Nas instantly established himself as one of the greatest lyricists of all-time (solidified with his 4/4+ follow-up albums), depicting everyday life in his native Queens project with great lyrical dexterity over EXCELLENT production. What makes Illmatic so special, however, is the fact that this album helped revitalize East Coast Hip-Hop, along with offerings from Method Man and The Notorious B.I.G. (rest in peace) in the same year. This album simply cannot be summarized in words; it is something that, when listened to, evokes the true essence of hip-hop by providing the listener with Nas's perception of his everyday dealings. Illmatic is not only one of the greatest debuts of all-time, but also one of the best hip-hop albums EVER. <br /> <br />Favorite tracks, in order: <br /> <br />1) It Ain't Hard To Tell (lyrical perfection!) <br />2) NY State Of Mind (vivid description of Queensbridge life) <br />3) Life's A Bitch (AZ + Nas = Instant Classic) <br />4) Halftime (lyrical braggadocio over an excellent beat) <br />5) One Love (excellent story, painted with realistic rhymes) <br /> <br />IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THIS ALBUM, BUY IT NOW! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR ENTIRE PERSPECTIVE ON HIP-HOP!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I seriously believe that OK Computer might be the best album ever. <br /> <br />The only thing to say to someone who hasn't listen to it, is that if you ask 100 random people what they think the top 10 of all time albums is, OK Computer will be there. <br /> <br />There are really no words to describe the music. Listen to it at all costs.
B000002B1M|5.0|Illmatic gave us a young, gritty, hungry, lyrically profound Nasir Jones. On It Was Written, we get a more mature, grandiose Nas, fully aware of his lyrical capabilities and versatility. This album  is arguably one of the most UNDERRATED albums ever. It Was Written is more \\"presidential-like\\" in perspective, with tracks such as \\"Take It In Blood\\" and \\"Affirmative Action.\\" However, Nas still makes a must-have record with his excellent flows over classic beats. Overall, It Was Written is simply a great, yet slept on, album from \\"Nasty Nas.\\" <br /> <br />Favorite tracks: <br /> <br />1) The Message (one of the most powerful records EVER) <br />2) Take It In Blood (great vivid lyrical descriptions) <br />3) Watch Dem Niggas (Nas speaks the truth on this song) <br />4) Affirmative Action (nice song back when The Firm was anxiously awaited) <br />5) If I Ruled The World (classic track w/ excellent music video, a great way to finish the album) <br /> <br />It Was Written is simply amazing.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I picked this up the same day I went out to get Tool's latest, and I've listened to it 20 times and the Tool cd is still sitting on the counter.  Just for kicks I put on some headphones at a listening station clicked the Wolfmother cd and just laughed with glee.  Zep, Deep Purple, Sabbath and a dash of grunge tossed in a blender on crush with the top off.  What comes flying out is fresh fuzzy and hard.  Hell yeah.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|If you like the RHCP, buy this album!!! it is fantastic! if you're expecting another \\"Blood Sugar Magik\\" type of album, forget it... those days are over, and their music has evolved. you can't keep playing the same stuff over and over again and expect to stay on top of everyone else, that just does not happen with any band. They don't sound like a band out of the \\"80's\\", they sound like an original rock band that is ahead of their time. I am and always have been a fan of RHCP, but this album is now probably my favorite of all their albums! Buy it, you won't regret it!! <br /> <br />
B00005JOVH|4.0|It's better than the critics say. It's better than the previews made it look. And it's certainly better than your average comic book movie or 3rd movie sequel (Superman 3: aimless; Star Trek 3: undercooked; Terminator 3: stale; Alien 3: murky; & on & on.)    I went in with low expectations for \\"Last Stand\\" and came out rather impressed. Most of the complaints I've read basically say, \\"I liked it, but I wanted more.\\" Come on now. All I really wanted was to see some mutants flash their powers around and kick [...] as they struggle to become more equal in society. And that's exactly what this movie delivers. A simple plotline with a heaping scoop of awesome special effects.    Okay, so the audience deservedly laughed at the explanation of why Jean Grey survived. And I can't figure out why the Golden Gate bridge connected Alcatraz to the mainland. And, yes, I'm left knowing nothing about the girl who walks through walls nor the white-winged Angel. But isn't that what more sequels are for? Spin-offs? Or even -- oh, I dunno -- maybe people could even go and read the original comic books themselves. As far as I'm concerned, \\"X3\\" was just what a 3rd sequel should be -- bigger, louder, faster and awesomely entertaining. Open your eyes and forget trying to make sense and you could have a really wild ride to enjoy here.     I can't wait for the DVD -- hopefully it will have lots of extras & cut scenes!
0446310786|5.0|This book is a classic - that is fact, not opinion.  It is one of my favorite books that I've ever read. Beautifully written, intriguing subject matter, characters that you could analyze for days....literary perfection.
B00005JOVN|5.0|Honestly I didn't even want to go see Poseidon because of the insanely negative reviews it got, but I went only because my boyfriend begged me to see it with him. I was lucky to have seen it on the IMAX screen, and for $15 per ticket I must say that it was worth it! <br /> <br />The movie starts out with gorgeous sweeping angels with the most majestic music that berated into the wide open surface of the ocean around the cruise ship. It starts off fast and there is no sitting around and waiting for something to happen. About ten minutes into the movie I was actually pissed at myself for almost missing it and the scenes in front of my eyes went from wild to insane. <br /> <br />This movie is extremely graphic to say the least. Except for some really dark war movies I have never seen people die and get hurt in so many ways to the point where the realistic portrayal knocked the wind out of my lungs. I felt as if I was there, tumbling with the ship hit by a rough wave exactly on midnight on new years ever. Watching the ship go from wild turning to being turned upside down, having the fuel leak and explode, the rooms fill with ocean water, people flying and dying right and left looked like some crazy National Geographic disaster special. I couldn't believe how hard the struggle for a small group of passengers was as they were going back to the bottom of the boat, now facing up, trying with all they had for a chance to jump into the bottomless black ocean. <br /> <br />This reminded me of the Titanic, and the characters were fresh and modern, they struggled and sacrificed honor and lives, and they took us with them thorough the intestines of the ship. Kurt Russell has always been one of my favorites and his determination and strength were quite powerful in this movie as he and a group or random people reached to the ends of their sanity and physical strength to move forward. Pinocchio sure made escaping out of a whale look a lot easier then escape from the Poseidon was. <br /> <br />Overall I loved this movie yet it was terrifying because it threw human mortality and fragility right in front of the viewer. I do not think I could have survived going through what these people went through and that was sad and scary. Really good movie, bit sad, bit heart warming and definitely very intense.  <br /> <br />And on the end note the music in the movie was staggering and breathtaking; it gave this movie such layers of depth that I got goose bumps from the first minute upon hearing it.

0792843584|1.0|I have never been able to find anything worthwhile in this film after two attempts to watch it.  Just a terrible film period.
0553801503|3.0|Poor George... pressued by fans, pressured by editors and publishers.  Just let the man write.  If we have to wait ten years, so be it.  I think the rush to publish ruined what could have been a legendary 6-tome collection.  Book 4 doesn't live up to books 1 through 3.  You'll still read it and enjoy it, just buy it used so you won't feel completely ripped off.  Hopefully book 5 returns George to his former glory.
0684824906|5.0|Abraham Lincoln was the greatest president in U.S. history. How did a self-educated, ugly, ill-dressed 'rail splitter' from Illinois do it, when his only previous political experience was a single unsuccessful stint as a congressman 12 years earlier? Doris Kearns Goodwin's answer is that Lincoln was completely underestimated by his contemporaries, until they finally figured out that he was a political genius, and very exceptional at handling people (a rare quality indeed).    William Seward was such a sure thing for the 1860 election that he prepared for it by taking an 8-month vacation to Europe to avoid risking it with a debate. The other two rivals, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates were highly qualified contenders, with Lincoln on the fringes. Lincoln, however, understood the political landscape, took a middle-of-the-road position on slavery (disappointing morally, but wise politically), and built a constituency; and his eloquence of speech, his humor, his humility, and his excellence of character, along with his political savy won the day.    After he became President, he astonishingly called his three rivals onboard as cabinet members, astutely recognizing that they were the most qualified men at that time for those positions. He had the admirable quality of forgiving and forgetting political and personal hurts, keeping the big picture of saving the Union in view at all times. Though his patience sometimes exasperated others, his timing was impeccable as he made the tough calls of military leadership changes and emancipation of the slaves (his idea, on his own). His fiercest enemies came to love him, and in fact, up until John Wilkes Booth took his life, hardly anyone had a bad thing to say about him (except for the secessionists and Copperheads, of course).    Although not usually given to superlatives, when Grant learned of Lincoln's death, he famously said: 'He was incontestably the greatest man I have ever known'. It is interesting that 140 years after his death, he is still incontestably great in our minds. You would think that 10 years of research by Pulitzer Prize winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin into all available public and private documentation would have turned-up evidence to the contrary. Instead, he was the rare person that looked just as good close-up as from a distance, and just as genuine as he seemed. It's a rhetorical question, but can you even imagine a politician today, either side of the aisle, coming close to Lincoln in character, bigger than politics itself?     He is underestimated no more!
B00005JOUM|5.0|The first thing that attracted me to this film was the cast.  Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer, Jodie Foster, heck Willem Dafoe is really a bit player in this one.  Not to mention that Spike Lee, not one of my favorite directors, but certainly capable of telling a good story, and the potential was there for brilliance.  By now, you know surely that the film deals with a heist of a bank, that the thieves are not after the normal booty that bank robbers go after, and that someone high up in the bank brass stands to lose very personally based on the actions of the thieves.  What you may not know is why the movie is so much fun and so great to see. <br /> <br />Clive Owen owns this film.  Yes, Denzel is great and carries his scenes well, but Owen has the task of not only convincingly playing a thief who is totally in control of the situation, he has to play the role in a way to illicit sympathy from the audience.  He does both things masterfully.  No doubt you will be in agreement that his performance is the landmark achievement of the movie and the reason it ultimately works.  Washington is a good two dimensional character, blending his desire to take advantage of this one great chance he has at landing a plum role within the police department and the fact that he is personally struggling with the pressure of his girlfriend who wants to discuss \\"the M word\\" and wear something on a certain finger.  In fact, this becomes a large part of the film, right up to the very end. <br /> <br />If I noted a couple of weaknesses in the film they would be these.  Jodie Foster's character, while necessary, seems to distract from the action.  Her role is somewhat important, but I wished she had not been there.  Also, the film wraps up somewhat clumsily, as it feels that an extra scene or two should have been left out.  This would have made the scenes after the main action feel much tighter.  The very end of the film was the only time I felt any urge to look at my watch.   <br /> <br />These are minor complaints, believe me.  In the end, this is a winner, top to bottom.  The scary thing about watching movies like this is that the idea the crooks had for robbing the bank is so smart, it will be a wonder if other people don't try it.  The heist strategy made that much sense.  I highly recommend this film.  You won't regret it.
B000EWBKM6|3.0|Like most people I know, I think NBC's \\"Will & Grace\\" peaked approximately between seasons two and four and has since settled into a predictable rhythm of amusement and frustration compounded by an overuse of guest stars trying to upend their images. However, what remains consistent over the eight seasons is the crack timing of the four principals - Eric McCormack and Debra Messing in the title roles (even as their characters became more neurotically tiresome) and more brilliantly, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally as Jack and Karen, as perfect a match of second bananas as Ted Baxter and Lou Grant on \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\".<br /><br />While quickly releasing a DVD of a long-running series finale is becoming standard marketing practice by the networks, it actually seems a shame that a bit more thought was not given to this package even with its bargain price. The final 45-minute episode, of course, is here but not the totality of the full-hour retrospective that preceded it on its May 18 airing, \\"Say Goodnight, Gracie\\". Instead, there are two featurettes. The first is \\"The Final Bow\\", which contains backstage footage during the filming of the last episode (versus similar footage taken of the penultimate episode for the retrospective). The second is \\"The Last Words\\", which extends on the interview portions with the individual cast members shown during the retrospective. Both are serviceable extras but hardly as insightful as one would have hoped given the endurance of the series (for instance, the critical role of fortuitous scheduling as one would think some credit should be given to \\"Friends\\" as a lead-in on so-called \\"Must-See Thursdays\\"). The most glaring omission, however, is the original pilot episode since there are several direct references to it in the finale, a point lost on anyone who does not remember it.<br /><br />One irrefutable point about the final episode is that the script by series creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, while not even close to the series' best, is completely in sync with the excessive, flamboyant spirit of the show itself. It was obviously not going to be enough to have the four characters play out their goodbyes in real-time. Instead, we get a dream sequence of the four characters sixteen years later; a flash-forward two years later showing Will and Grace reconciling over her perceived betrayal in rejecting Will as her baby's \\"father\\"; and most ludicrously, a fateful meeting eighteen years after that when their respective children end up living in the same college dormitory. I actually think the escalating contrivances are what make this a classic sitcom. It doesn't have to make sense as long as fans are in thrall over how the characters' lives evolve. Detractors certainly have reason to raise their eyebrows, but there are certain pleasures to be experienced, for instance, Jack and Karen's sweetly performed duet of \\"Unforgettable\\" emboldened by Mullally's supple singing voice and the silly opening dream sequence. I have to admit it would have been a nice tweak had the offspring of Will & Grace been of the same sex and that they marry without incident. To me, that would have summed up one of the underlying messages of this groundbreaking series., is completely in sync with the excessive, flamboyant spirit of the show itself.

B000002B2X|5.0|1. Brother - 9/10 Beautiful track, Ann Wilson's voice was a brillant addition to this track.  <br />2. Got Me Wrong - 10/10 Very catchy tune. Some cool playing by Cantrell, overlapping guitars once again can be heard here. <br />3. Right Turn - 10/10 Layne Staley and Chris Cornell...need I say more? Well how about Mark Arm from Mudhoney singing along as well? Totally kickass tune. <br />4. Am I Inside - 5/10 Not my favorite track, but it has a unique sound/style.  <br />5. Love Song 0/10 - This track is beyond weak...pointless really. Apparently Sean Kinney (drummer) was the singer and Layne Staley actually was drumming on this song. <br />
B000007ODM|4.0|For the MMA fans of Pride who wish to listen to the entrance muisc of the Heavyweight Pride FC champion this is the CD for you. <br /> <br />It has the song \\"Enae Volare Mezzo\\" which is Fedor's and his brothers entrance song.
B0007Y08T2|5.0|I believe I'm not alone when I argue that Dark Tranquility's '95 album \\"The Gallery\\" is the cornerstone of the Gothenburg melodic death metal sound, as well as the album that took it into a different dimension. This album has the trademark harmonies, melodic solos, occasional female vocals, and a stellar production; but at the same time, it's not \\"straight-up\\" melodic death like In Flames early albums or old Arch Enemy. No, \\"The Gallery\\" has a progressive feel to it, and a somewhat Gothic atmosphere to it. (I would connect this to Stanne's lyrics.) Dark Tranquility use a technical flair on this album not found in many metal bands; meaning that the transitions between the riffs are kind of weird. You know, the type of thing where just as you're getting into a nice riff, it switches up on you, and you're taken by surprise, finding yourself saying, \\"Woah, didn't see that coming!\\" However, it's not self-indulgent and the technical moments seem to make the album deeper and keep things interesting, rather than just trade riffs back and forth. For instance, \\"The Dividing Line\\" starts off with a strange, amorphous drum pattern leading a jagged guitar lead, but right after this, the boys kick it into high gear with ass-kicking harmonies in true Gothenburg style. <br /> <br />My love for the guitars on this album is unfathomable. From the gorgeous interlude \\"Mine is the Grandeur\\", which tastefully utilizes three classical acoustic guitars (harmonizing with each other, of course) and booming timpani drums, to the epic yet somber \\"Lethe\\" and the frantic neo-classical solos on \\"Punish My Heaven\\", it's total perfection. The display is not totally virtuostic, and the harmonies add so much impalpable atmosphere to this record. The bass playing is superb as well. Instead of playing regular root notes, the bass seems to be a totally independent instrument by itself, as seen on \\"Edenspring\\".  <br /> <br />One of the greatest things that grabbed me about this album was the drumwork. The listener doesn't get pummeled to death with double bass overhauls or endless thrashfests, but the drumming firmly supports the music. To sum it up, it's technical, intricate, but not over the top. Anders allows to music to breathe, and his odd patterns add a lot to the music.  <br /> <br />Stanne's voice here is his best, I think. His raspy screams are at his emotional heighth on \\"...Of Melancholy Burning\\" and the vicous \\"The Emptiness From Which I Fed\\", and his lyrics are far from the metal norm. You can feel the sorrow through his screams, and he doesn't try to be another Anders Friden clone. There are some occasional clean vocals, and the female vocals on the title track work perfectly, giving the album even more of an epic feel. <br /> <br />This is definitely an essential metal album, and I would place it in my top 5 of the 90's. Pick up at all costs.
B00065JTBA|5.0|So, basically this Box-set is a final \\"shut-up\\" to every shallow narrow-minded person who used to be grumpy about Bon Jovi as a band, and of course, what's most important: their music. Jon's a little thinned hair, Richie's divorce, the departure of bassist Alec John Such and some major flops like the recent \\"Have a nice day\\" aren't enough to write off this legendary band; and with this 4-CD-box they will rock the hell out of you, I tell you. <br /> <br />    This Box spans and encapsulates pretty well everything what the Bon Jovi phenommenon is about. We get 4 hours of delighful music from very different peroids of their career with many particularly important gems; among them the very early-\\"7800Fahrenheit\\" outtake which owed much to bands like Dokken (1985), incredible material from sick-in-terms-of-great-stuff \\"Keep the faith\\"-sessions (1992), the best of B-sides and some great soundtrack-music like \\"Good guys don't always wear white\\". It's definately the best band's music you can hear since a long long time, and undoubtedly their best LP in at least 10 years.  <br />Some of the die-hard-fans (like me) already lost the faith in these guys after terribly mediocre \\"Have a nice day\\" which is currently at stake. But - as we all know - every band has got it's ups and downs. And I'm not going to drone on whether the present band cannot write good songs anymore; nevertheless they put out arguably their best LP ever (with all of the songs written long time ago) along with the newest, most horrible and least accomplished one. Coincidence? I hope not.  <br /> <br />     But back to the buisness... this CD finally and definitively shuts mouth to all the critiques of this band. Firstly, Jon's singing is as good as it has always been, only he does things which he probably wouldn't venture on \\"normal\\" records. Among these experiments is the fabulous \\"Temptation\\"; I honestly don't know to what should I compare this one, perhaps I'm too young to have something on my mind. Nevertheless, this is a very solid and ambitious effort, to my mind - somewhat reminescent of the 60's or 70's - with absolutely perfect, cool pacing; once you've heard it you will listen to it many times in a row, I guarantee. Definitively one of the most important highlights on the entire Box set. I'm also keen on Jon's voice experiments like on \\"Last chance train\\", where he sounds like he's just undergoing voice's breaking. On rest of the songs - obviously - he keeps up the standard of good old \\"anthem\\" and sing-along-choruses as well. <br />\\"Out of bounds\\" and \\"Flesh and bones\\" is a Richie Sambora statement that proves how ferociously gifted - and underrated - guitarist he has always been. \\"Sympathy\\" is another one. The riffs are very good, skillfull, catchy, passionate. A great testimonial for Mr. Sambora himself is beyond doubt \\"If I can't have your love\\" where he sings on his own and proves once agian (after solo-debut \\"Stranger in this town\\") that many times he does vocal parts even better than Jon. All in all, every band member gives a taste of his vocal abilities here - both the drummer and the keyboardist have their shots here. Well-worth attention is the new - far superior to the original - version of \\"Always\\"; it seems much more mature and not teenage-aimed-only. \\"Nobody's hero\\" is a beautiful, slow acoustic ballad with beautiful paino-play by the keyboardist David Bryan and scarcely any guitar or drums; and it's the piano and non-chliched, mature lyrics that make the songs so perfect. Definitely another big highlight on this Box-CD. I could go on for some time like that... <br /> <br />    The Box set a a whole also shows how the band matured in terms of lyrics. From wild and overly-sexual \\"We rule the night\\" to also sexual - but how much mature and elaborate (!!) - \\"The fire inside\\". The aforementioned is yet another major gem here; slow, puerly acoustic with great elaborate lyrics perhaps should have made its way on the \\"Keep the faith\\" album to balance the power-ballads like \\"Bed of roses\\". And for those who would like the hear the old good Bon Jovi, there's a \\"Billy\\", there's a \\"Edge of a broken heart\\", there's a \\"Sympathy\\"... I can come up with only a few songs that are not top-notch here and somewhat don't suit here. These would be  <br />\\"Real life\\", \\"Thief of hearts\\" or \\"Kidnap an angel\\" which are  <br />somewhat cheesy and reminescent of the worse part of Bon Jovi's career and the later peroid of songwriting. One major blunder occured also: why the hell one of the greatest band's efforts, \\"Let's make it baby\\", didn't make out neither the \\"New Jersey\\" LP nor the BOX-set?!!? Had the few abovementioned not-so-good songs been replaced by some fan-chosen ones (I strongly opt for \\"Let's make it baby\\"), this would have been clearly not only the best Bon Jovi album ever, but one of the best in rock-muisc history. <br /> <br />       To collate the facts, this is a great testimonial of ONE of the greatest (not the best!) rock-bands of all time.  I honestly cannot come up with a better compilation availible on the market. Bruce Springsteen's last one was OK... bur not much more than that, whereas this here truly kicks your butt !! Perhaps only Metallica's \\"Garage Inc.\\" can stand up with this one in terms of accomplishment and coherence. The selection of the songs is almost perfect (with few flaws that don't matter among 50 tracks). Absolutely all of these - but a few - are great and incredibly well-crafted; overall it's a very ambitious, acomplished piece of musicanship that is diverse, sometimes experimental, non-cliched yet not at all lacking this peculiar, melodic BJ-flow that we all love. <br />Definitely some of the songs wouldn't have had even a slight chance of appearing on other group albums; so here we have them all neatly packaged, to listen, explore and discover Bon Jovi we didn't even know existed. This is a delight for all the fans; <br />of course, all open-minded passionates of music will be very contented with this one as well as it truly contains a very solid, melodic rock-stuff. And, besides, If I dare, I might recommend this one to all sceptics out there that do not believe in BJ as a band. Here it proves once and for all it is a lot more than pop-rock or \\"It's my life\\".     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B00005JLEX|5.0|Larry David must be a modern day television Midas--though the touch didn't come to him until he was in his 40's. No matter. As the driving creative force behind \\"Seinfeld\\", as Seinfeld himself admits, he co-created, executive produced, and wrote or co-wrote the majority of the \\"Seinfeld\\" episodes from the pilot through season 7. When he left the show was never the same again. The character of George is based on him. Kramer is based on his former real-life neighbour, and Elaine's relationship with Jerry is based on his relationship with a former girlfriend. Many shows are based on David's, sometimes very odd, real-life experiences. And then he went on to the great \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\". But that's another review.  <br /> Of course, Larry David himself is a very odd individual. The documentary on the making of \\"Seinfeld\\" that comes with this set is, when focused on David, as funny as any of the shows themselves and the shows are great. He is an entirely unique individual which is clearly where \\"Seinfeld\\" got it's singular sensibilities from. This dvd set comes with about as many \\"bells and whistles\\" as any \\"Seinfeld\\" fan could hope for. Included is the documentary already mentioned--the best of the lot in my opinion--commentaries, line notes, Seinfeld's stand-up routine from his 1981 debut on Carson, bloopers, deleted scenes, etc... <br /> The shows in these first two seasons are quite leisurely paced. Some fans may prefer the quicker pace that came in the following seasons. Are these two seasons the best of \\"Seinfeld\\"? I don't think so. The best was still to come. But what is that saying exactly? \\"Seinfeld\\" is the funniest series ever to come to television and if this set doesn't quite match up to the next two that doesn't mean that greatness isn't on these discs. It is. \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" episode especially is a \\"Seinfeld\\" classic and took a series that was already delightfully novel even further into uncharted television waters. Some of my other favourite episodes are \\"The Pony Remark\\", \\"The Jacket\\", \\"The Heart Attack\\", and \\"The Revenge\\". The simple fact is that every show in this set is funny. Even more, as shown by the huge success of the show in syndication, they are rewatchable funny. Time and again. And that too is unique. <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />
B00006LSTH|4.0|Maybe there is no certain answer to that, but if you consider Metamorphosis, you can see that some efforts have been done. <br /> <br />The essential idea of the album is to release some outtakes and alternate versions of songs, from \\"Out of Time\\" to \\"Memo from Turner\\": albums like Aftermath to Beggar's Banquet and Let it Bleed. There is great surprise to hear variations in some classics, like \\"Heart of Stone\\"; but there's always the sense of wanting more, and maybe there's the appealing idea of this album: to see that the real gems in the stone's songs are not in the vaults, but in every new album.

0736063684|5.0|Great book.  It shows you some of the best exercises for each of the different muscle groups.  Along with showing you the actual muscle being worked in the excercise, it tells you how to do the excercise and usually tips and variations of it.  Pick this book up if your wanting to know new excercises to add to your workouts, a newcomer to weight-training, or just wanting to know the exact muscles being worked by particular excercises.  You wont be dissapointed with your purchase.
B00006LLLN|4.0|As a general rule, I don't care for recordings of live performances as much as studio recordings. This is usually because the crowd noise interferes with my enjoyment of the music. That is not the case here. In fact, it is one of the best live performances I have ever heard recorded. <br /> <br />I was also not too familiar with Alison Kraus and Union Station beyond being names I have heard. This was my first recording of theirs. It was wonderful.  <br /> <br />Some of the music is old fashioned bluegrass and some is more in the country line of things. Both are done with superb skill in terms of singing and instrumentals. In fact, the band seems to be one of the most competent group of professional musicians working together today. Each comes to the fore at various times and each does a wonderful job. <br />
B00001ZWTT|1.0|What irks me most about this sorry film is that it blows the chance for a legitimate film version of the classic 60s TV series.  There have been some very good and very bad remakes.  This is in the very bad category and blows the chance for someone to do the TV series any justice in the future.  Who's going to remake a WWW 2 or even watch it if it were made?
630542828X|5.0|This movie tells part of the story, Hollywood style, of the Woburn contamination legal saga which took place in the eighties as a wave of toxic tort lawsuits were sweeping the nation. Trichloretylene (TCE), a common de-greaser, Toluene and some other chemicals were dumped after use or leaked through pipes and other sources into the public water supply including wells around Woburn, MA. A number of plaintiffs filed suit claiming an abnormal number of leukemia and other health related issues. This movie focuses on the hardships faced by the people and their lawyers as they fought against lying employees of large companies, crafty lawyers and insensitive judges. While some of the movie is true, as is often the case with a Hollywood dramatization of so-called true events, much has been left out of the story.<br /><br />For one thing, the movie fails to mention the scientific controversy over whether in fact TCE is harmful at all. Indeed, TCE was once the decafinating agent of coffee and was used in dry cleaning processes. Other communities around the country faced similar exposure to TCE with no noted adverse health effects whatsoever. While Toluene, a nasty chemical with known adverse health effects, was also involved in Woburn, this movie focuses on TCE, a chemical sometimes compared by toxicologists to have similar health effects to peanut butter and red wine.<br /><br />Robert Duvall, John Travolta and William H. Macy deliver outstanding performances in this movie. And while Hollywood may have over-dramaticized certain aspects of the case, Travolta's observations during narrative over dubs about trial processes in general are insightful and largely accurate. It's a good movie, even if one side is portrayed more sympathetically than the other. But then, that's Hollywood.
B000E97HIA|4.0|To respond to Amazon's review...I too think Beck is a great artist and no disrespect, but Prince is not the black Beck - Prince is PRINCE!  The only black anything Prince is...is black Prince and 3121 proves it.  The influence of Prince is all over Beck.  Again, no disrespect but do not compare Prince to Beck.  Prince is in the Master Artist league of originals along with Bob Marley, The Beatles, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson.

B00005JOVH|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies I've seen all year long. And that says a whole lot coming from me. I have never been a comic book reader, and have only mildly enjoyed the recent movies that have come out that were based on comic books. I was not crazy about the first 2 X-Men movies, they never had me glued to the tv. So when I went with my husband to see X3, I expected the same results. Boy, was I wrong. There is so much more action in this one, and more fighting, mutants vs mutants and mutants vs humans. This was by far the best one I thought. I also think that another thing that made this film even more interesting to me than the others is the fact that there was the 2 different battles (like I said, mutants vs mutants and mutants vs humans). So there was almost constant battle! I loved it! I can understand why hard core comic book readers would be disappointed in this one because there is so much that was left out compared to the comic (my husband told me what was left out), but if you're just a girl (or guy) who's never read comics and are looking for a good action film, this is definately it! Great movie!!!!

B000E8N690|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" is an excellent portrayal of the life of Johnny Cash, an American rock and country icon, and of his relationship with June Carter, whom he has been in love with since he was a boy. This film is very similar to the 2004 film \\"Ray\\", but has two excellent lead performances instead of one. Excellent musical performances and a solid cast make for one great film, one of the best of 2005. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as the Man in Black, fully channeling not only his performances on stage, but also his life offstage, his strange obsession with June Carter and his struggles with prescription pills. Reese Witherspoon gives the performance of a lifetime as June Carter. Cash and Witherspoon's onscreen chemistry is one of the key factors in the overall success of this film. Excellent dialogue exchanges between the two keep the movie fun and exciting, with each lead performance bringing something different to the table. There's Phoenix channeling Cash's troubled soul and addiction problems, and then there's Witherspoon's quirky, upbeat character who quite literally saves Cash's life from a downward spiral of addiction. <br /> <br />The film's music is great, with one memorable supporting performance with Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley, complete with the hip-shaking dance routine. The cast is solid all around, and the dialogue and acting are very good along with onstage performances. \\"Walk the Line\\" is one of the best films of 2005 boasting two of the best performances of 2005. Onscreen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon along with great musical performances make this film a real winner.
B00006FM77|5.0|kwd \\"silent soldier\\" wrote in his review above:   <br />\\"The only tweak I might make would be to eliminate the 4th 'bonus disc' only because the first three are so satisfying.\\" <br /> <br />To which I respectfully reply:   <br />\\"Good Jesus God, no!  Track 7 (\\"An Hour in the Shower\\") on Disc 4 is alone worth the price of admission of this set.  This is Terry Kath at his absolute most finest! <br /> <br />As for some of the other reviews above, I tend to agree that additional versions of the extended \\"Introduction\\", \\"South California Purples\\", \\"Sing A Mean Tune Kid\\" and \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" were probably unnecessary - even though they also feature Terry Kath's guitar work at its finest - and I would have preferred some other songs not included on the original 3-CD or 4-album set.  Surely songs like \\"Poem 58\\", \\"Prologue/Someday\\", \\"Liberation\\", \\"Movin' In\\", \\"The Road\\", \\"Poem for the People\\", \\"Wake Up Sunshine\\", \\"Prelude\\", \\"A.M. Mourning\\", \\"P.M. Mourning\\", \\"Memories of Love\\", \\"What Else Can I Say\\", \\"Free Country\\", \\"At the Sunrise\\", \\"When All the Laughter Dies in Sorrow\\", etc. were also played at this concert. <br /> <br />However, I do appreciate Chicago's (and Rhino's) efforts in making sure that Terry Kath has been prominently featured in so many of the bonus tracks of the Rhino reissues of the \\"real Chicago\\" albums.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Wow! Throughout this whole CD I was floored by the similarities betwixt Eminem and Ace of Bass. Remember them? They were a great band in the late 80s who defied convention, spoke up to the injustices of the world and laid down a groove that would make your feet and soul bounce with delight.<br /><br />What I hate is that people are calling this CD full of negativity. Negativity? Is that what you're calling refreshing honesty these days?<br /><br />Well, I'm not going to be pushed around by some PC thug. I choose to bask in the delicious freedom of my words and the velvet-like comfort of my snug fitting tank top.<br /><br />Because liberty is alive in Eminem, you can taste it. I don't have to worry about someone with bigger muscles throwing me to the ground and kicking me over and over even after they've gotten me to cry, ripping your pants and trampling your beret. Unlike the outside world, I'm not judged by my preferences in soft drinks (fanta), headwear (the aforementioned beret) and preferred style of sideburns (aggressive).
B000F0UV0E|2.0|This album is spotty, and leaves much to be desired as a Mark Knopfler project. It has no central anything. And without going into vast detail, this hopefully one off is not worthy of, If you are a collector of all things Knopfler or Emmylou, by all means acquire it. If you like either of these artists, buy their solo albums. This one is a drowse, and I simply do not care for the songs or the playing. They seem calculated and searching without any real answers to anything that the collaboration promises.....might be just me, but I don't think so.
1400079179|2.0|I read the book and to me, it started better than how it ended. I'm Catholic, but not too devout, so in essence vulnerable to theories that can scientifically prove the weaknesses of the Catholic religion. I denounce the Inquisition, the constant changes and toying with the Bible by myriads of people, in Canon Law and other institutions according to the whims of every new pope enthroned, Pius XII's position towards the holocaust, the protection and lying about priest's perversion and child molestation, and even Opus Dei's questionable methods, to just say a very few that come to mind, and to make clear that I wouldn't put one finger on the fire for Catholicism. Even so, I was baptized, my children are baptized and I attend mass at times, and think that it will sure take more than Dan Brown's attempts to make my level of faith erode.<br /><br />With Catholicism, it is true that you may never know what really happened when Christ was alive, and especially whether all those things about Christ, aside the entire MMagdalene theory, holds true, such as the resurrection, miracles, etc. If on the same book, the Bible talks about Adam and Eve, and later talks about Christ and what he and all of his friends, relatives and predecessors and sucessors did, where are you to draw the line and separate from Bible fiction and non-fiction?<br /><br />After reading the book I felt like I had foolishly wasted a half week of my time plus $8 bucks. There was nothing I could take away from the book, besides a couple at the most of historical events that proved interesting but which I could have easily seen on History channel in any routine show. I really don't understand the hype, when for instance, pages over pages are filled with space fillers that only serve to thick up the book, e.g., cheap novel writing. I'm even skeptical about Dan Brown's \\"research\\" capabilities since 1/2 of the book is unsupported and simply made up, and if I wanted to read pure fiction, I would have bought and read good, decent fiction, not something that looks like a hybrid of both. Upon finishing I felt empty, fooled, deprived of $8 and with certain anger. If it was fiction, then he would've been much better off by providing the audience with a fiction prize, such as the findings of the bones or the lost gospels, and not with ethereal metaphors, what people did not expect or wanted to find.<br /><br />It is people like you and me who have been manipulated by the media and have been hipnotized into a mediocre literary work much alike cotton sugar which looks bulky but which disappears as soon as you bite into it. Dan Brown should thank all of us who have put an undeserved grain of sand in his bank account.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars for Mr Brown's commercial and money-making wits, not  for anything else.nd read good, decent fiction, not something that looks like a hybrid of both.

B00007E8V4|5.0|In their own kind of tongue in cheek way, System of a Down release their 3rd album \\"Steal This Album\\" in more or less a plain package with seemingly hand written (or should I say scribbled?) writing and get this, no CD insert either. Maybe it was their poetic way to poke at \\"Internet Piracy\\". In any case, it is another blistering, artistic metal album loosely similar to their last (Toxicity). <br /> <br />A lot of the songs are songs that were recorded in the mid 90's to present day. System claims that these are not B sides and I would have to agree because each and every song is very enjoyable. Just like previous albums, this one has some politically charged songs, some weird abstract songs and then some rock out songs. And I have to say it, some of the abstract songs are just weird. Best example of that is the album's first track \\"Chic N Stu\\". It's just plain out weird and just so I can get it out now \\"pepperoni and green peppers, mushrooms, olives, chives\\". Again, I'm not too sure what this song is about but it's pretty funny if you ask me. <br /> <br />And then you get probably one of the most well stated political songs in the past few years in \\"Boom!\\". This song should be the new anti-war anthem of this era because it speaks volumes to how some of us feel about war and its consequences. I'm not sure if this song was a single anywhere else but \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O\\" was a pretty big single on rock radio in Minneapolis and one of the best tracks on the album. It's another just totally out there song but it comes across so well. Some of my other favorites on this album include \\"Innervision\\", \\"Bubbles\\", \\"Nuguns\\", \\"Pictures\\" and \\"F the System\\". Truly, there are no really terrible songs on the album, just a few I skip sometimes (like \\"36\\" and if I'm not in the mood for a laugh, \\"Chic N Stu\\"). <br /> <br />Anyway, still a great album. I really don't know how these guys do it so well because so far I haven't listened to a System of a Down CD I didn't like. Another great metal masterpiece, guaranteed! 4.7 stars, just call it 5 though just to be safe!
B000A5044C|1.0|I really don't like this movie in the way Koreeda treated. Although he made this movie based on the actual event, he didn't made the movie exactly the same as the way it happened. Before applauding this movie without knowing the truth you should know what actually happened in 1988 in Sugamo. The fact is that those children couldn't go to a school because most of the time the mother gave birth to children at home and never registered children's births. The second son died shortly after giving birth, so the mother packed the son's body into a plastic bag with deodorant, and hide in a closet. After that she got involved with a man and left behind her own children at home. The oldest son had to take care of his siblings without enough money and before long he started having fun with two friends. One day he noticed that someone ate a cupnoodle which he bought for stockpiling. When he knew his younger sister(the third girl)who was still 2 years old had eaten it, he beat her hard. Looked at his doing to the girl infant his two friends joined the discipline. They dropped her to the floor from a high place, kicked her like a ball, and finally beat her to death. The oldest son was in the next room with the knowledge of their deed. After they went to home he knew his sister was dead, so he packed her into a plastic bag with deodrants and hid it in the closet as his mother had done before. However, there weren't enough deodrants in the plastic bag, the body started to stink so badly. He had no choice but to dispose her to somewhere. He packed the body into a traveling bag, and abandoned the body in the park where one of his friends had been before. In the movie, he packed her whom accidentally fell off a chair and died into a suitcase, and carried it with a girl who didn't like to go to school to near the place which is near to the air port. Recalled the sister loved to see an airplane he decided to go there. The mother once told them their real father was a pilot. There exitsa huge gap between the real event and the movie. Of course, the mother and other people around them had responsibility for the event,and I understand Koreeda's intention that he wanted to focus on mainly children. However, there was more behind the movie. I just don't understand Koreeda said that he wanted audiences to know children grew up without anybody knowing about it. He should have been faithful to the real event because such an unbelievable event should be remembered without glorifying.
B00005JP4U|5.0|If you are thoughtful but confused about the debates on global warming and climate change, you should take in this movie.  It will be good for your mind, and maybe good for the planet.  But go with an open mind, don't be afraid to question your assumptions and the movie's assumptions....just don't hide your head in the sand or pretend that you already have the answers. Being confused is human, but giving up on learning is a form of death.  Engage yourself, and engage these ideas. <br /> <br />   Yes, the vast majority of scientists and scholars have no question that global warming is occuring and that the earth is changing dramatically and dangerously.  They also largely agree that if we reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, develop alternative forms of energy (sun and wind, among others) and take  steady steps towards conservation and recycling, we can manage the potential nightmare ahead. But there is room for you to have your own thoughts and opinions too, just make sure those opinions are formed by discussion (especially with those who may disagree) and curiosity and openness. <br /> <br />     It is the closed minded among us who are in truth making the world a more dangerous place, whether it is the islamic fundamentalists or the opinionated commentators whose minds cannot think beyond there own long-held prejudices. Challenge yourself and develop your mind....engage this movie and its ideas.  Or read a good book.  Just don't stop thinking, questioning, and learning.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Do I really need to offer a synopsis of a film that we've all seen? In fact, do you need to read yet another review that holds Jackson's directing and his cast's acting in high regard? No. That's not what I've done here, either.<br /><br />Instead, I'd like to pay tribute to Tolkien, whose imagination sowed the seed that has grown into the Great Tree of this trilogy and its cultural shade.<br /><br />(I know, I used the same intro for my other LOTR extended scenes review.)  Artistic license continues, as Jackson, Walsh and Boyens reduce \\"huorns\\" to \\"trees.\\"  Small potatos.  I was glad to see the march of the ents extended, and the involvement of Fangorn at Helm's Deep was missing from the theater-length production, so good addition on that score as well.  Let's applaud the writers for including Arwen & Aragorn throughout the film (Tolkien relegated it to an appendix, despite its deeply personal importance to him), and we should give them high-five for the \\"Forth Eorlingas\\" sequence.  I've never experienced goosebumps from the glory of a battle scene before--not even while watching \\"Gladiator.\\"  Kudos.<br /><br />Smeagol really makes the movie.  He has the best lines, best facial expressions, best mannerisms, weirdest demeanor (girls, don't pity him--\\"he's a villain\\"--all the girls that watch with me think he's cute), etc.  I suppose the smash-hit Smeagol phenomenon is a bit odd, given that he's only half-real.  So props to Andy Serkis (who I guess was himself a prop) and the digital design crew.<br /><br />WHEN you buy this, do yourself a favor and spend a wintery day off watching the bonus discs in front of a roaring fire.  Masterfully done, all of it.<br /><br />ALong
B0007OY2P8|1.0|This adaptation was the worst I have ever seen. Even if it were not an adaptation it would still be lousy. There was no continuaty, the dialogue forced, and the acting was horrible. If no one was familiar with the story they would be completely lost and confused. It was pure choas.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|I was fairly impressed with this movie. The terror scenes, and killings are top-notch and their creators should be praised. The plot/script, however seemed like a train wreck(no pun intended). The characters were not believable, and the first and second halves of the movie don't fit together. If you're looking for scares, this movie is lacking. Blood, however, is plentiful.<br /><br />I liked it, but EVERY HORROR FAN MUST BUY THIS to figure out for themselves.
B000002UAU|5.0|Ok, I may not understand the full context, having been born in the late '80's, but this album is still very wonderful.  Personal favorites were \\"She's Leaving Home\\", \\"Getting Better\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", and \\"A Day in the Life\\", although I think all the songs were good, even if sometimes seeming a bit...well...weird, like what I'm about to tell you.  I wanted to write this to warn that at the end of the CD (or LP) just after \\"A Day in the Life\\" is a dog whistle that can be heard by humans (especially on the CD) and that I find very annoying followed by some very interesting...erm...talk/laughing.

B00005JMXX|5.0|I was scared when i finished this film.  This will be a day that will be unforgettable in my whole life.  The cold weather will kill many people on earth, and we will be going through ice age? I feel unbelievable and shock after watching this film.  The situation looks horrible and unpredictable, the whole world will be changing.   <br /> <br />I think most of the people will start to recycle and try to help the environment after watching this film.  But what more we can do? It sounds too late already.For years we are hurting the environment, susch as cutting down trees, using too much chemicals and air pollution.  For so many years we are abusing the environment, it's already hard to help it, instead we can try to maintain the situation we are having and not making it worst.  This film can show us the consequences we will be taking if we continue to pollute the environment.  It tells us that this is an urgent and serious problem that we have to face, it's important for everyone of us who are living in the world to know about this message, everyone should recycle and save the world!
6305922756|4.0|Rarely do I come across a movie as funny and original as This Is Spinal Tap. Ed Begley Jr is an absolute genius. His unique method of creating this fictional documentary - or rather -\\"rockumentary\\" that contains hilariously realistic interviews, is truly one of the kind. Once again, Christopher Guest manages to pull off his character with perfection, within every small detail of his performance. Along with Guest, all of the other characters are equally great to watch, and of course the outrageous hairstyles and skintight costumes make a huge plus. Spinal Tap's depiction of typical 80's British rock bands also comes off as quite accurate, and the film enables audiences to take a look at the peculiar but funny culture of hard-core rock n' roll. To top it all off, the songs that are performed will not only make you laugh, but are also catchy enough for you to find them stuck in your head. Although Spinal Tap might seem to lack a real plot, if you truly appreciate good movies, this is one film that you will not want to miss. Cleverly spontaneous and quirky, This Is Spinal Tap is definitely a classic.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|X3: The Last stand is the Last Straw for Shawn James. The X- trilogy comes to a horrid finish under the lens of the inept Brett Ratner. Brett Ratner is to X-men what Joel Schumacher is to Batman. In ten years people will be denouncing this X-Trilogy the same way they do the first Batman Saga. Unfortunately, there won't be a Chris Nolan and David Goyer or a Sam Raimi around to rectify the mistake this time.<br /><br />Ratner makes a total 360 from what little story Bryan Singer tried to build in his first two films. The convoluted plot involves a \\"Cure\\" for mutation, the Pheonix, rising from the ashes, and a war. Each of these stories would make for a great movie in and of themselves, but Ratner throws them in a blender and makes one big mess. There are too many stories, too many characters and no focus. But Storm needs more screen time, the studio needs Halle, and Ratner just uses CGI special effects to patch up the plotholes and totally derive from the course of the comics being adapted. In the first ten minutes Ratner uses the Phoenix to Kill off Cyclops and Professor X, characters crucial to the X-Saga. I guess this is so Storm can be leader and have more screen time. Thank you Miss Halle Berry. Someone in your entourage should advise you this old Broadway adage: THERE ARE NO SMALL PARTS ONLY SMALL ACTORS. It's not how much screen time you have, but what you do with it. Sadly she gives the same flat uninspired performance she does in every movie post Swordfish.<br /><br />Due to Halle's insecure need for more screen time, Ratner's incompetent directing and Fox's need to beat WB's Superman Returns at the box office, X3 falls completely apart over the course of 90 odd minutes. Ironically, these three political forces behind the camera sabotage the intriguing political stories in the movie. The movie strays way off course from the comic storylines it's adapted from and heads into Batman and Robin territory. In the comics, Jean who loved Cyclops so much she held back the evil Phoenix force and sacrificed her own life, Kills the man she loves with impunity. Wolverine loved Jean so much he couldn't bear to kill her. But in this movie he slaughters her with ease. But this change of story course from the comics is nothing compared to the numerous strays from the original two movies. Rogue who struggles and deals with her inability to touch others by finding another way to connect with them (emotionally), just cops out with a wonder drug. Iceman just decides to date Kitty Pryde because it's convenient to the plot. During the big battle sequence, Magneto abandons a cured Mystique, his loyal lieutenant of two movies. Six X-men take on an army of morlocks so storm can get her big battle sequence. And Magneto, the brilliant military strategist doesn't have enough sense to throw a force field around himself while Six X-men are shooting \\"cure\\" darts allover the place. Hey, he always keeps a magnetic force field around him in the comics, but in this movie he just decides not to. And when the war is all done, thousands of lives lost, billions in property damage, both sides shake hands and back to business as usual with a Don't ask, Don't tell policy. But these plot points don't matter. It's a necessary compromise so Storm gets more screen time.<br /><br />When you think about this movie it truly is the \\"Wolverine and Storm\\" of the X-Franchise a complete and unmitigated disaster. The entire movie feels rushed and sloppy; it seems like Fox just wanted to get a product out before Superman Returned; quality be damned. The acting is flat and one-dimensional because characters aren't' written with any depth. To cover up the bad acting and bad writing, Ratner overloads the movie with special effects. Yes, the special effects are dazzling; seeing the Golden Gate Bridge torn apart is amazing. But there's no story behind them and no build up to that big final sequence to make us care. Thanks to the political forces behind the camera, The X franchisehas a forgettable ending and will be a footnote in superhero movie history like the first Batman Franchise.<br /><br />Skip this movie and look for the two episodes of the old X-Men cartoon: Apocalypse Rising and Come the Apocalypse. They actually tell this same story better in one hour than this confusing movie does in 90 minutes.table ending and will be a footnote in superhero movie history like the first Batman Franchise.  <br />Skip this movie and look for the two episodes of the old X-Men cartoon: Apocalypse Rising and Come the Apocalypse.

B000E33VWW|5.0|If all you know about Truman Capote is based on his appearances on the late night talks shows you're in for an eye opener.  If you are familiar with Breakfast at Tiffanys and In Cold Blood you may think you have a grasp of the scope of Capote's brilliance, but again you've got another think coming.  Capote was simply on of the most brilliant and complex writers of the 20th century.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman doesn't play Capote, he embodies him.  He seems to shink in size to fit, yet the character grows larger and more rich as the movie goes along.  Catherine Keener as Harper Lee is a revelation.  All the supporting actors play their roles brilliantly.  The screenplay is tight, focusing on the priod when Capote wrote In Cold Blood, still one of the most chilling books I've ever read.<br /><br />Simply put this movie is a must see and probably a must own.  The bonus features flesh out the character even more.  Highlly recommend, perhaps the best movie I've seen in a couple of years.
B0000BWVCM|1.0|X2:X-men United is true to the Comics I used to the read when I was a teenager during the late 80's: convoluted story, a mishmash of plot threads and deaths and violence thrown in just for the sake of it. These movies aren't for us regular joes, they're just for the 30+ year old fanboys who live in their mother's basements and have been reading the comics since they were twelve or thirteen. Don't try to understand it; you'll lose your mind. I never understood why this book was so popular. It should be called X-Mess. I am so tired of these superhero movies. If you can't do them right please don't do them at all.<br /><br />In this pitiful installment, the movie starts with Nightcrawler attacks the president in the oval office in a beautiful special effects sequence. Sadly, this is the only part of the film worth watching. This assault leads to General Stryker to begin his campaign to attack mutants, starting with Xavier's school. Little does anyone know that General Stryker is the one behind the attack on the president. An added subplot is Wolverine searching for his past. In a long sequence, Professor X soon sispatches Storm and Jean Grey to take the blackbird and find Nightcrawler, While he and Cyclops go to talk to the imprisoned Magneto.<br /><br />Storm and Jean Grey find Nightcrawler and he tells them he didn't know anything. Jean surmises he was mind controlled. After the school is attacked, and we get a Colossus cameo Wolverine and a group of X-men hole up at Iceman's house. Iceman \\"comes out\\" to his parents. The police and military get whiff of this and we get to see Pyro do his thing. Soon the bad guys working at the prison get wind of Xavier and capture him and Cyclops. Magneto makes a thrilling escape with mystiques help. Soon the X-men and the evil mutants team up against Stryker, thus the title X-men united. Everything leads up to a long drawn out face-off at a secret base in a dam where Jean Grey sacrifices herself. Fanboys can drool at the Phoenix effect at the bottom of the lake at the end of the movie and save their pennies for the next sequel. These X-men movies blow chunks. Slow pacing, slow action sequences, and flat acting. In ten years people will be denouncing these movies the same way they do the first Batman Saga. Unfortunately, there won't be a Chris Nolan and David Goyer or a Sam Raimi around to rectify the mistake this time.<br /><br />What makes these movies so horrible is the attempt to please comic fans and not casual filmgoers. If you're a comic fan something like a Colossus cameo is cool, but to a regular moviegoer it means nothing because he does nothing but show up. While it is KEWL for them to use their powers, This takes away from time to develop characters who actually have speaking parts and a role in the story. This dilutes the already slow story and takes away from the overall pacing of the film and wastes valuable screen time main characters like Cyclops, Professor X and Jean Gray could have used to explain their parts of the story. (it's inexcusable the way Cyclops has been treated in this film series. He's the first X-man and leader of the group and he's been given the least amount of screen time.)Yeah, every comic fan wants to see their favorite character onscreen. However, in moviemaking  filmmakers have to focus on the principal characters and their role in the story.<br /><br />The acting is flat in this movie with the exception of a few actors because they get a full part written. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen Shawn Ashmore give solid performances because they actually get a substantial part. Alan Cumming is a great Nightcraler. Cumming steals every scene he's in, making the most of his screen time. James Marsden is an Okay Cyclops and Famke Janssen is a decent Jean Grey. Halle Berry is a terrible Storm. Seeing her in this film and the first one I can say she lacks the presence and personality to play this part. Halle's uninspired acting and facial expressions are a major drag on an already slow movie. Fast forward through her scenes.<br /><br />Pass this Trilogy by and pick up Sam Raimi's first Spider-man or The best superhero movie to date, The Incredibles.an already slow movie.

B00004Y6NU|2.0|I can't belive all of the 4 and 5 star ratings for this. I have been a HUGE Dire Straits fan for much of my life and admire Mark Knopfler's style and sound. All of the Dire Straits albums are more or less masterpieces or close to. However, i think \\"Love Over Gold\\" is a experiment gone wrong. This is not a traditional Dire Straits effort, it is much darker then all past or previous efforts, suffering from lots of tedious and meandering moments. This really does not sound like Dire Straits at all, save for Mark's voice. The best song on here is \\"Industrial Dieseas\\", definatly on of the best DS songs, but the rest? over-blown pretentious garbage. Hard to belive that this is sandwiched between their two best albums, MAKING MOVIES and BROTHERS IN ARMS. <br /> <br />Telegraph Road: Way too long at 14 minutes. I think the reason why people like it so much is because of the length. <br /> <br />Private Investigations: Another boring song. One cool riff in the middle, but much of this song is a snooze-fest <br /> <br />Industrial Dieases: Only salvageable song on this mess. Great song, sounds much more like Dire Straits. <br /> <br />Love Over Gold/Itnever Rains: again both are simply to life less and boring.  <br /> <br /> Much of the music on this sounds like easy listening. I was dissapointed when i first got this. Tries to \\"get into it\\" many times but have fallen asleep trying to do so. Better off getting the debut, MAKING MOVIES or BROTHERS IN ARMS.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Ok, this album does have its moments. Unfortunately they are far and between the rest of the Sleepy-time stuff.  I do like the older feel, like Obscured and Meddle, but it misses the mark lyrically and playfully.  I guess I was hoping for some kick ass guitar work here.  Even the solo's seem predictable and bland.  To wait this long for a solo effort and get such a laid back effort tells me he has hung up his gloves. It is a sad day for us all.   <br /> <br />All I can do is ask for Dave to give us one last grand moment and get back with Roger and the boys.  Your fans have bought your album, now return the favor and get The Floyd back together.  Please! It's not to late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around. <br />
0812550706|3.0|I'm on a mission to read the 100 best novels of all time off of two lists.  The \\"experts\\" and the readers.  Ender's Game is only on the readers list.  Here's why... <br /> <br />I'm a sucker for science fiction.  I'd never heard of this book until a close friend turned me on to it.  And, of course, it is on my list.  So he loaned it to me and I read it over a long weekend.  I admit, it was hard to put down.  It's what I call a \\"easy read\\" compared to Bram Stoker's Dracula, which is a \\"hard read\\".  My friend asked me what I thought.  I told him this, \\"I enjoyed it. I wish I would have read it as a teenager and I would have praised it.\\"  Thus, the 3 stars instead of four.  Your adolescent will adore this book.  When you read it...and you should....you will see that there is a point where it should have ended.  After that ending we, in my opinion, we get a bit of cheese. <br /> <br />Card does a tremendous job developing characters.  You have to love and feel for Ender.  The ending has a neat twist, and all in all...this is a cool story.  I might eventually read the sequel, which is also an award winner, but I'm not immediately inspired to do so.
B00097DX3U|5.0|A few years ago, if someone were to tell you that Rage Against the Machine and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden were going to get together and cut a few albums, they'd be lucky if all you called them were a dreamer. This was a mash-up that not even RATM or Cornell could have seen coming. Yet, back in May of 2001 that's what exactly happened; Audioslave was born. Fueled by Cornell's famed self-loathing songwriting and Morello's patented guitar playing, the super-group shot to the top of the charts with 2002's self-titled debut, Audioslave. But despite having an already established fan base that followed the group from their original bands, they were missing something: rock critics' appraisal. The album was met with luke-warm reviews, and for good reason. Chris Cornell's subject matter and musical stylings didn't exactly fit with his band's rap-rock roots. The band just didn't feel comfortable throughout the whole album, and only the smash-hit singles \\"Like a Stone\\" and \\"Cochise\\" really gelled well. <br /> Well, it's now May 2005 and they drop their sophomore effort, Out of Exile, a chance to redeem themselves. And from the first track out, one thing is for sure: they have. The band seems to have finally found their foothold, and that is blues-rock played with a certain grungy feel. The opening track, \\"Your Time Has Come\\" (their second single), gets you pumped, and I was already air guitaring to the blazing solo the first time through. It actually has a memorable riff! Congrats Audioslave, you just achieved something your previous effort failed miserably at! Although very few of the other tracks achieve the brilliance of the first one, almost all are spectacular. <br /> This near-masterpiece marks Cornell's best set of songs in 11 years (a.k.a. since Soundgarden's Superunkown.) A fair amount of ground is covered here, from the soft, lullaby like rock of \\"Doesn't Remind Me,\\" putting the listener into a trance, to the metallic-tinged \\"The Worm,\\" which locks into a call andresponse between Cornell and Morrello, leaving you teetering right on the edge of head-banging, to the almost `60's sounding \\"Dandelion,\\" the sweetest song the band has put out yet. Each song has its own feel, which is very important; otherwise the whole album would seem to drag on and on. The whole record exudes 1970's Jeff Beck; as I stated before, the album has a heavy blues-rock influence. Some of the really heavy songs have a strong Black Sabbath sound to them, which is expected, as them and Led Zeppelin were the main influences of Soundgarden. Of course, since the musicians here are so far into their career they seem to have more of their own, copyrighted sound, than a mish-mash of others. <br /> I'm not to forget Tim Commerford (bass) or Brad Wilk's (drums) contributions to this work. Wilk's drumming is as tight as ever, and combined with Tim's bass work, they help keep Cornell and Morrello from losing themselves when the music gets a little indulgent. Commerford even leads a few songs, his bass setting the tone of \\"Yesterday to Tomorrow\\" and \\"#1 Zero.\\" The rhythm section was arguably the most amazing part of Rage Against the Machine, and their importance and talent here hasn't diminished a bit. <br /> One of the other reasons this record succeeds is because Cornell seems to write a little less depressing, muddled songs, which lets the band stop bogging down and start rocking out. But all the great facets of Cornell's songwriting seem to remain intact here. That's a big plus, as what this band needed was not a retooling, but simply a fine-tuning. As usual, Cornell is an unbelievably strong vocalist, emotionally and physically. He truly proves that he has the right to sit with greats like Robert Plant and Freddie Mercury. He can growl like Brian Johnson (of AC/DC) or sweetly serenade your ears on a track like \\"Heaven's Dead.\\" <br />The only real complaint I could have is that the album seems to loose its energy and drag on in the last 15 minutes, which could simply be due to a bad track order. But that's minor. Very minor. <br /> This album is without a doubt one of the major accomplishments of the musical community in the 21st century, and will be looked upon as one of our generation's classics. Whether it will still be usurped by Audioslave's next record only time will tell. Let's just say for now that Audioslave has earned the term \\"supergroup\\" with Out of Exile.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I think tool set the bar to high on Lateralus. I would give this album 1 star, but because I am a tool fan I am giving it 3. This album has about 37 minutes of noise on it, and only about 4 actual complete songs, only 2 of which I like. I still think tool's best albums are Lateralus and Undertow, even Aenima is a better album than this one. I consider a great album, one that I can listen to the entire CD over and over again, I can't do that with this CD. Oh well, This is just my opinion. You don't have to agree
B0007GAEGC|3.0|Some of the songs on this album are original. Some are canned goods reopened again and again. Do we really need another Ave Maria? Chloe's rendition of this classic was flat, toneless, and lacking in any emotion. Her refusal (or inability) to add some color and vibrato to her impressively clear voice becomes annoying, as she could be singing these pieces so much better. She needs a little more training before I can listen to her singing without cringing. The next Charlotte Church she is not. <br /> <br />The other vocalists, however, offer great performances, but I wish they would have picked some more Gaelic/Welsh material. Meav has an amazing crystal clear soprano and sings her pieces with ease. She and Orla have very pleasant voices. Mairead plays a mean violin. I recommend this album to anyone interested in expanding their horizons and needing some music to relax to. (I certainly enjoy singing along to it!)
B00005JOVH|3.0|\\"The Last Stand\\" is the first in the \\"X-Men\\" series to truly embrace its pulpy comic book roots. It's a fun action picture that sets up its pins and knocks them down without pretending each demise needs its own aria to accompany it. This development may disgust the purists who devoured comic books like every other kid, then decided in their twenties to reimagine those mindless hours as advanced lessons in sociopolitical ethics.  <br /> <br />Not that director Brett Ratner, taking over for Brian Singer, completely drops the hot-button issues at play in \\"X2.\\" He merely dials down the portentious weight of them. Xavier(Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) are still at odds. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) still marches to his own drum. Storm (Halle Berry) still has nothing to do. Rogue (Anna Paquin)is still weird. And the U.S. government is still looking for an answer to the mutant question, and this time it presents a pretty interesting one: Using the DNA of a boy called Leech (Cameron Bright) to eradicate the mutant gene completely. Though \\"the cure\\" is optional, Magneto, now a fugitive, sees it as an entryway to a final solution, and intends to stop the production entirely.  <br /> <br />Shoehorned into this storyline is the resurrection of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) as the Dark Phoenix, whose telekinetic powers dwarfs the skills of anyone else, including Xavier, who locked the Phoenix away in Jean's mind when she was a girl. The disaster at the end of \\"X2\\" - in which Jean sacrificed her own life to save the X-Men jet - cocooned Jean in the water but destroyed the mental barriers (How? Who knows?). Cyclops (Scott Marsden)revives her. But it's not the same girl who went into that water.  <br /> <br />Besides Jean, \\"The Last Stand\\" slips a few jokers into its deck. One death is unforeseen, as is one betrayal, and one of the X-Men is hot for the cure. Ratner mostly pulls off the large action sequences, including the 30-minute finale at Alcatraz that begins with Magneto's rerouting of the Golden Gate bridge and ends with a showdown between two lovers.  <br /> <br />Unlike Singer, who allows his movies to be edited within an inch of their life, Ratner lets his camera breathe a little. The special f/x aren't as glossy and the lighting isn't as dramatic - the movie looks more like a lush, inky Spielberg picture than the study in primary colors of \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X2\\"  The screenplay by Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn may lack eloquence, but it also isn't so stilted - no Nightcrawler reciting the Lord's Prayer. \\"The Last Stand\\" explores the mutants without subjecting them to low-level Shakespeare. Even Kelsey Grammer, who could have turned mutant government official Beast into a Professor Xavier clone, delivers a zestful, light performance. If Frasier can relax, so can you.  <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|Muchos se pueden decir que la carrera solista de Paul McCartney puede ser buena o irregular; irregular en su etapa con los Wings, salvo excepciones o bastante buena en su carrera solista, principalmente los ultimos discos que ha sacado en los ultimos 9 años. Este es el caso de \\"Chaos and creation in the backyard\\", un disco que tal vez sea de las mejores obras de McCartney como solista.    Aparte del casi estricto nivel exigente del productor de este disco, Nigel Godrich, McCartney sabe cuando enfrentar situaciones, por ejemplo el productor decide eliminar a la banda de acompañamiento y dejar a Macca, responsable de todos los instrumentos. Partiendo con \\"Fine line\\" un tema al estilo beatle mezclado con Wings, que da una frescura que no pasaba hace tiempo; luego, el extraño y atmosferico \\"How kind of you\\", para dar paso al hijo de \\"Blackbird\\" según McCartney: Jenny Wren. Luego vienen temas principalmente el piano como instrumento principal en canciones como \\"At the mercy\\", \\"English tea\\", \\"Too much rain\\", que sorprenden de uno a otro; punto aparte merece \\"Friends to go\\" un emotivo homenaje a George Harrison, en la cual McCartney refleja su cariño a George y por que no a John tambien.    La segunda parte comienza con \\"Certain softness\\", tal vez uno de los temas mas bajos del disco, ya que tiene una estructura muy parecida de \\"Somebody who cares\\" del disco \\"Tug of war\\", realmente pasable, luego viene uno de los temas mas llamativos, tanto por su estructura musical como el texto en \\"Riding to vanity fair\\", realmente suena totalmente a McCartney modelo 2005, luego \\"Follow me\\", un tema menor, pero no deja de ser intersante; para dar paso a \\"Promise to you girl\\" tal vez el unico tema rockanrolero con sonidos muy ochenteros al mismo tiempo. Al final \\"This never happened before\\" y \\"Anyway\\" quizas temas que se pueden ser pasables, pero igual es solido e interesante.    Que se puede decir, McCartney sigue rejuveneciendo en forma increible, a momentos olvidando algunos momentos con Wings, para retornar con sonidos a The Beatles, a \\"Flaming pie\\" y sonidos nuevos y frescos.    Rating: 4.5 estrellas
B0000C7PRY|5.0|This is amazing stuff. Music for the heart, not only for the ears. Morse met Jesus and found LIFE. This music is incredibly alive!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|As far as the one true reason I started watching the show was the men are extremely sexy! I love the character of Dean because he can make a smart ass remark about almost anything to make the show funny mixed with the ultimate feeling of fear. Sam on the other hand is the nice guy who just wants to be normal but is unable to due to his older brother whom he reluctantly joins on a mission and comes home to find his beautiful girlfriend killed in the same manner of his mother. The fact that Sam agrees to go with Dean is bittersweet because later in the episodes Sam mentions going back to college when the demon is found. I loved when the dad was introduced to the veiwers because the greif and the sadness aspect became apparent with the father's actions. The true respect the brothers have for their father is rare in other shows and really unusual in real life. I would recommend this show to anyone and watch it religiosly on the WB. I am glad it was picked up for another season because I would hate for it to end with the season finale the way it was. I have had my share of jumping, screaming, and even having to turn the lights on due to my overwhelming fear the show put in me. I think it is good to scare yourself every once in a while, I just do it every week. I hope everyone takes time to watch the show that is amazing beyond belief!!!
B00000K19E|5.0|I still to this date watch this Movie !! <br />For anyone to Ragg or Dog on it makes really no sense If it wasnt successfull there wouldnt be a second and third movie! <br />Of Course in the Beginning It seems kinda slow but its the story playing out trying to tell you what a normal person living their life is like.  <br />Then..... <br />Everything Changes.... <br />Once the talk is all over.... <br />Action Begins...  <br />WoW .. Beauitful Special Effects One of a kind for its time, and im sure if anyone who still has not seen this movie Im sure they would enjoy !  <br />A good couple of great Killer Action Fights which Defy All gravity! <br />Thers action , Comedy and of course a love story gets envolved. <br />In the end it all makes sense that it was  a Success ! <br />Matrix Fans Rejoice !!! <br /> <br />>:D
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|I can sum up this anime in a word: disappointment, but I highly doubt that alone would be very useful to anyone so I will go a bit more in depth.<br /><br />First a little background, I'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy franchise and see Final Fantasy VII as the best title in that franchise. So it is with a great deal of sadness that I actually feel that this movie warrants such a low rating, but I couldn't rate it any higher based on its merits.<br /><br />I'll start with the strengths, and this should be the obvious one, and that is the graphic quality and animation. The detail on the character models especially is virtually unsurpassed, some truly impressive CGI on Square's part. Unfortunately, I still don't see it as perfect even in this regard, a lot of the scenery felt generic and the character movements often lacked an organic or natural feel to them.<br /><br />The music was pretty well done and the voice acting wasn't too bad for the most part although I honestly wouldn't rate many of the performances as great or truly stellar in either English or Japanese.<br /><br />The story is where it all really falls apart though, or rather the lack of a story. For starters it backpedals the story of the game itself, pretty much defeating the whole accomplishment of the game in a matter of minutes, recycling the same old villain and sticking Cloud back into his bubble of self-pity that he works his way out of through the course of the game.<br /><br />Now throw in a lot of meaningless action which revolves around fights that basically just drag on and on until someone losing is convenient for the story. The blows exchanged in the battles are pretty severe from start to finish but the only time it really shows anyone tired or losing is when the story requires it, otherwise it's just a meaningless and flashy exhibition of action. Pretty much every fight revolves around Cloud as well, the major characters from the game have disappointingly minor roles, the one real fight they are involved in their presence really makes no difference aside from providing Cloud with a ridiculous and cheesy boost.<br /><br />There's no real gravity to their situation, despite the intended evil they're facing no one really falls or dies or even gets injured. Nothing really carries the weight a story of this magnitude should and even the ridiculously over the top action only manages to further make it feel so artificial you can't take what little story there is seriously.<br /><br />As an exhibition of CG and action this movie is decent enough, but in all other areas it is either mediocre or fails outright. When you get other titles out there like Karas that actually manage a story and are visually stunning themselves there's little reason to purchase this aside from attachment to the game in which it is based. My bet is that Square was depending on that to make this cash-in of theirs, and why not? It worked, unfortunately even I gave them my money for this.<br /><br />Now let's see how many \\"not helpful\\" votes this gets for daring to give a bad review.lly makes no difference aside from providing Cloud with a ridiculous and cheesy boost.

B00004TWZF|5.0|What was interesting about the Big Blue is how it was all based on this one main Character that we follow from childhood through life.  <br /> <br />And while the movie maintains its aspect of being a drama by creating a truly ethical, thoughful, and touching moment. It also rolls into the story the lives of others, as well as hints of comedy and romance.  <br /> <br />The movie is passionate about creating situations to evoke emotions. The comedy is subtle and you won't be on the ground laughing but you'll just be chuckling to yourself and feeling like this movie has everything. <br /> <br />The romance has you stopping and thinking about what to do with your own life. And what you did and what Jacque did. And in many ways it even touches upon the realities of love itself.  <br /> <br />When watching the Big Blue do not sit down and expect a serious drama that is meant to be explored as a play. Instead watch it as if you were watching someone else's life and everything that it encompasses. Watch it not for what happens in the movie, but for understanding why it happens and how the director molds the scenarios to create a truly timeless ending. <br /> <br />The Big Blue is no second-rate old film that should be looked at only critically. The directorial techniques make you feel as if you were in the mind of Jacque and not just watching him.  <br /> <br />The underwater shots in themselves are breathtaking and watching them unfold is like seeing a symphony of magnificence.  <br /> <br />For anyone that wants a movie that makes you think about life, choices, and what it means to be human, and free, pick this up as soon as possible. If your studying existentialism I highly recommend this film.  <br /> <br />Truly a classic.
0385336691|4.0|I love the Reacher character and wait with excitement for a new novel.  So it was good to \\"connect\\" with him again, but The Hard Way skimmed the surface where Child could have given us more depth and believability.  Has Child run his course with this character?  I hope not, but I'm not going to be as anxious for the next novel.
B00004Y6NT|2.0|This was Dire Straits' second album and is the weakest of all their albums. This album only has like 2 good songs, Where Do You Think You're Going', and 'Lady Writer'. Rest of it is BORING. <br />Buy it anyway if you want to be a Dire Straits collector.
B000002ADT|5.0|When I first got this album, I didn't like it at all. I didn't hear any of the passionate dissonance that I loved in albums like Bitches Brew, Agharta, and Live Evil. Everything sounded too smooth and polished. It ended up filed away somewhere in my closet.  <br /> <br />Years later, I ended up with a copy of this on my computer. It was late at night and I was feeling fairly relaxed. I put this on and... wow. I was simply blown away. Kind of Blue is now one of my favorite albums.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the best way to think about this is as an inverse of Bitches Brew (well... actually, Bitches Brew would be an inverse of this, technically speaking, but I digress). Both are very complex and layered and become more rewarding with multiple listens. However, the simmilarities end there. While Bitches Brew projects chaos, sadness, and devestation, Kind of Blue is the sound of order, joy, and peacefulness. Everything fits together melodically and is phrased as though it's supposed to fit. It will relax you and make you feel calm whenever you listen to it... much more than the supposed \\"smooth jazz\\" that's popular today. Kenny G wishes he could create something so comforting, soothing, and intricate.  <br /> <br />If you want to hear something like I've just described, this is the album for you. There is a very good reason why it is regarded by almost everyone as one of the greatest jazz albums of all time. However, beware! If you want something up-tempo, this is not for you. If you want something chaotic and dissonant, look somewhere else. Listen to this album knowing what it is and expecting it to be what it is. You will be rewarded.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|I'll have to tell you this album's quite good. Here's how each and every song is. <br /> <br />1. So far away---a great song but kind of repeats for 2 minutes <br /> <br />2. Money for nothing---ah, the best on the whole album!!!! It is pure hard rock and heavy metal as for sure, everyone's favourite. <br /> <br />3. Walk of life---the last rocking song on the album til tk 8. <br /> <br />4. Your latest trick---it's good, not my favorite. <br /> <br />5. Why worry---one of the most boring songs on the album, and one of the saddest songs dire straits ever recorded. it has a good ending. <br /> <br />6. Ride across the river---if you're over in Africa...listen to this song, it is pure metal. <br /> <br />7. The man's too strong---now in my opinion, this is the weakest and worst song on the whole album. It's really boring.  <br /> <br />8. One world---it's good it's not the best though. <br /> <br />9. Brothers in arms---a pretty good anti-war song though guns and roses civil war is better antiwar. this one makes me a little sad, just like why worry. <br /> <br />It's a pretty good mid 80s album <br />but maybe not DIRE STRAITS best work. <br />Time to play: 55:15
B000050XXO|4.0|Dear Manager. <br />I know that this is not the appropriate place to talk about subtitles but amazon does not give any chance for foreign custumers ask questions. I would like to know if the films wich are being purchased have another languages subtitles, portuguese for instance. If not, I suggest that this technical information would be available. Would be helpfull. <br />Thanks. <br />Eduardo.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|Dire Straits Debut, released 1978. <br /> <br />This was the original album from Dire Straits containing one of the biggest and earliest well known song, 'Sultans of Swing', and more such as 'Down to the Waterline', 'Six Blade Knife', and 'Lions'. You get great metal in 'Setting Me Up' and 'Southbound Again', quite good. This album is quite good <br />so buy it, the only bad songs are In The gallery, Water of Love's just a joke, and Wild West End. <br />Thank you and I hope you read my review. <br />
0440238609|5.0|Christian fondlementalists notwithstanding, I believe anyone from their young teens to their early hundreds would enjoy this superb story. Pullman stuffed an entire Oxford education into his pipe and blew out a whopper. This isn't a science book, this is meant to be fun, so readers who understand what fantasy means will not quibble with the particle physics. The characters are outrageous and fascinating, and the worlds they live in are full of surprises. Throughout the trilogy and almost to the very end, Pullman continually adds layers to the story, making it a rich page-turner you will whip through with delight.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|For some reason, a lot of people don't like this album. A lot of people like the lame Dire Straits albums like BROTHERS IN ARMS and the DEBUT. Those are good but this one was one of their greatest along with Making Movies, Love Over Gold, and On The Night. It has some of the greatest songs ever made in 'Heavy Fuel', a song that the radio never plays that is actully the greatest and one of my all time favorite songs. It's a track worth a listen, and just about as rocking as 'Money for Nothing'. <br />Don't get me wrong, THIS ALBUM IS A WINNER!!!!! OVER A MILLION STARS AND REMEMBER, HEAVY FUEL ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!! BEST OF 1991.
B000E41MS6|1.0|Five DVDs.  Five words.  Stupid. Inane. Vapid. Mind-rot. Pabulum.    As has always been the case with this ridiculous series, the appeal of Dr. Who to the viewing public baffles me.  Never has this been more true than viewing this sub par re-imagination of an already below par television show.    The equally ridiculous price of this DVD boxed aside, there's very little you could honestly term \\"genuine entertainment\\".  Unless constant jokes about flatulence is your thing, mind you.      The new Dr. Who is annoying and has an extremely bad crew-cut.  Forget flamboyant costumes, this guy wears normal clothes.  If I remember correctly all the other Dr. Whos wore flamboyant costumes.  Those are gone.  So are alien planets apparently.  He calls his ship a spaceship, but it never goes to an alien planet in any of these DVDs.      Then there's his spoiled and whiny assistant who looks like she'd rather be anywhere than filming this series.  She also brings along an equally whiny boyfriend and a grating mother along for the ride.          As for Dr. Who's aliens, please.  You'd think that in 2006 they could at least do something about the quality of the creatures.  The first episode has ridiculous rubber mannequins, the second has a plethora of bad rubber creatures:  (i.e. a giant rubber head, a miniature little blue rubber one, a flat rubber one.), they must've run out of rubber by the third episode as it had zombies.  What are zombies doing in a Sci-Fi series anyway?  The most idiotic alien had to be the (again) rubber monsters with gas trouble.  The British fascination with bodily functions may be humorous in the UK, but  to the rest of the world it's childish and not very good television.    Look, this show clearly has its fans, but someone needs to be honest to anyone out there who isn't and thinking of buying this overpriced DVD boxed set.      If you fall into that latter category AVOID this ghastly re-imagination.  Save your hard earned money for better DVD fare.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Making Movies is Dire Straits' third album. <br /> <br />Well this album has four of the classics such as Tunnel of Love, Romeo and Juliet, Skateaway, and Espresso Love. Hand in Hands ok <br />but overrall weaker than the rest of the songs on the album. Les Boys is the only song that a lot of people don't like. It's actully a pretty good song but it dosen't seem to rank the best song by Dire Straits. Anyway, this was a great 3rd album from <br />one of my all time favorite bands. Mark's older stuff ROCKS!!!
0380713802|5.0|This book is hilarious.  <br /> <br />If you've ever travelled Europe or wanted to this book puts you into the passenger's seat. One of his earlier works, Bryson has the uncanny ability to distill what's funny about a people, place or situation and stamp his own brand of humour on it. <br /> <br />I've read all his books, I reckon this is 'Bryson's Best' to date.
B0002XV30Q|3.0|There are two albums of Saint-Saens' complete piano concerti available in the Amazon catalogue. This from EMI classics, and one from Decca. With two extra tracks thrown in (the \\"Wedding Cake\\" waltz, Opus 76, and \\"Africa Fantaisie,\\" opus 89), this is the better bargain. Plus it's cheaper. I highly recommend it for these reasons, especially if your only interest is familiarization with all of Saint-Saens' five piano concertos, as was mine. Whether the Charles Dutoit performance is better, I can't say as I don't own it.<br /><br />As for the performances in this disc:<br /><br />My interest in Saint-Saens' piano concertos was fired up when I first heard his 2nd Piano Concerto performed by Cecile Licad. That stupendous performance (yes, I considered that adjective very carefully and find it absolutely appropriate) was also conducted by Andre Previn and accompanied by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (another Brit orchestra). That recording is also available in Amazon catalogue. Do buy it if you are a connoisseur of Saint Saens' second piano concerto. It is a definitive performance, one that am sure even Saint-Saens would approve of VERY enthusiastically. Just listen to the cadenza of the first movement in the Music Sampler and hear for yourselves.<br /><br />Now back to this album. As noted earlier, it is also conducted by Andre Previn. But what a difference a pianist makes. I refer here to the performance of the second piano concerto. I skip it, actually. Having been spoiled--blissfully, ecstatically--by the Licad stunner, I cannot bear the stultifying interpretation in this one. I just listen to the other piano concertos and enjoy them. These piano concertos are excitingly atmospheric, with the composer's unmistakable mix of boister and mystery. As noted from an Amazon review of the Decca album, a recording of all of Saint Saent's five piano concerti is rare enough. So for that reason and the cheap price, this album is a good buy. I just try not wonder how other pianists, like Licad for instance, would play them. I just enjoy Saint Saent's piano music,  The other performances are still very enjoyable, excluding other considerations. After I received this album from my sister as her Amazon gift, I now know that Saint Saen's piano concertos really rock!!! They are for me.<br /><br />For the price and the extra tracks I'd give this album four stars. But for its dismal second piano concerto (cringe, cringe), three stars.instance, would play them.

B000E1MTXQ|5.0|Its rare that a sequel equals or surpasses the original, but I think this movie does it.  And that's quite an accomplishment given the quality of Bourne Identity.  This movie is fast paced, has a great plot and acting, and the action never lets up.  The fight scene with the other Treadstone agent is one of the best ever.  The HD DVD is beautiful and the sound is great.  I can't wait for the third installment in this great series.
B000002MP2|5.0|i must say i was blown away by this album. It really seems that with Dookie, Green Day were able to find that spark that was just slightly lacking on their two previous attempts (1039 smoothed.... and Kerplunk) to create the Holy grail of all Green Day albums, not to mention one of the greatest records of the 90s (and in my opinion ever). The record is similar to those they put out after this (Insomniac, Nimrod) in that the songs all have a similar feel to them, and they all just fly by and the album is over before you know it. However, Dookie just seems to stand out, and although Billie Joe's limited guitar skills are rather evident on this album, each song just seems to have something special about it, and they all become well defined in your mind.    This album features those classic Green Day songs such as Longview, Basket Case, and When I Come Around, but really any of these songs is worthy or recognition. I really can't listen to Longview unless I've heard Chump before it, and the short trio of Coming Clean, Emenius Sleepus, and In The End are three fabulous examples that songs need not be any longer than 1:50 to be brilliant. Burnout, Pulling Teeth, Welcome To Paradise, and Sassafras Roots are a few of my favourites as well, but the great thing about this album is that it maintains a very high quality throughout the whole thing.     Basically, this is just one of those albums you should have if you are a fan of music. Even if you hate Green Day, it's hard to listen to this album without becoming engrossed in it's insanely catchy, punkish sound.
B000E5KJGQ|5.0|I've watched this movie several times, but the HD DVD version was the best.  It is a nice clean transfer in the original aspect ratio (the DVD release was cropped to 4:3 and highly compressed).  This is the definitive Vietnam war movie-great cast, dialogue, and editing.  I forgot that Adam Baldwin was in it (he also played my favorite character Jayne in Firefly and Serenity).  His role felt like an early prototype for Jayne.  And R Lee Armey was just fantastic.  This movie is not for the faint of heart, but I highly recommend it.
B000002MTR|5.0|I remember buying several chili peppers' studio albums a few years ago. I purchased \\"BloodSugarSexMajik\\",\\"One Hot Minute\\",\\"Californication\\", and \\"By The Way\\" and I listened to all four albums.<br /><br />I absolutely HATED the Chili Peppers' music save a few choice songs that had been radio hits.  In particular, I HATED the 1995 album, \\"One Hot Minute\\". I hated the songs, the noises, and the general feel that was expressed by all four Chili Peppers on the recordings.<br /><br />I HATED the album enough to put it on the shelf for a few years.<br /><br />Now, I recently picked up \\"One Hot Minute\\" and gave it another spin, and I began to like the songs, the noises, and the general feel of the album. Eventually, I LOVED the album.  I love this album more than the other three; I listen to this album at least once every week.<br /><br />Buy a used copy and if you hate it, keep spinning it, and someday, this album will be an addiction.
B000E5KJD4|4.0|Fans of the musical will love this movie because it follows it quite closely.  The casting is nearly perfect:  Emily Rossum is gorgeous as Christine, Patrick Wilson makes a fine Raoul, and Minnie Driver is great as Carlotta.  I think they could have picked a better Phantom, but Gerald Butler pulls it off.  The HD DVD transfer is beautiful and the sound magnificent.  Emily really can sing like an Angel.  If you can't make it to Broadway, then watching this movie is the next best thing.  Highly recommended. <br /> <br />

B00005ASOC|4.0|If jamaal was actually going to teach Sean Connery something he should of mentioned some other poets that were not European. There should have been some comment from his mother about poets of color to create yet another dilemma in his world. Anna Paquin is a fine young lady but, I wish that interest would have developed only slightly more. She was obviously attracted to him for being the new phenomenon at the school as it is in real life.<br /><br />It attempted to do something in this film but it didn't quite finish. I agree with many others that attempts were made but the development of the possibilites did not happen. For somehing with a little drama it is worth watching. Not thrilling but a start. Being smart should not always be how many common European poets one knows but how vast the diversity of thoughts one can pull together to see the beauty that comes from differnt experiences and perspective. Can't give it a 5 because it was Eurocentric(the norm) not culturally diverse(the future).
B000002UJQ|4.0|Wow, I'm pretty scared in voicing my opinion here:  I'm not the world's biggest Radiohead fan, I think The Bends is by far their best effort, and I have always missed what a lot of people see in OK Computer.  I still find the fortitude to award this '97 release four stars, even though I shouldn't; most take any rating less than 100/100 and immediately write it off with the same old \\"you just don't appreciate this type of music\\" attitude.  Nonetheless, OK Computer is still a good accomplishment from a good band, containing several blockbuster tracks to back it up.  Admittedly, the first three songs are pretty amazing, with the divine `Paranoid Android' leaving listeners hoping for more of the same.  Oher highlights include `Karma Poilce' and the closing number `The Tourist,' but after that the album gets patchy in places.  Really, how vital are `No Surpises' and `Lucky'--I heard better songs off Standing on the Shoulder of Giants than these; these skipable throw-aways represent filler on any other album by any other band.  Now die hard fans will look at me sideways and attempt to spit on me for my views, but the fact stands that OK Computer is a bit overrated.  Not enough tough stuff (What happened to rockers like `Just' and My Iron Lung' that balanced out the slow stuff?) and very few memorable tracks outside of the aforementioned.  Listen to this and (What's the Story) Morning Glory? back-to-back and than inform me which album is more memorable.  Still a four star because so many people regard it so very highly, but not as great as one would expect from an album put on the same pedestal as Nevermind and Dirt for best album of the Nineties.  By the way, compared to The Bends and Definitely Maybe, it's not even close.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have to say that until the spring of 2005 I absolutely LOATHED the Phantom. My mom has seen it at least twice and has the original London recording on a cassette, and she used to make me listen to it when I was little...apparently I thought it scary. But when the movie came out, my friends were all dying to see it, and I was actually going to go along and humor them; never happened. We ended up waiting till it came out on dvd and rented it for Mother's Day (b/c once again, my mom wanted to see it).<br /><br />As soon as the overture started, with everything shining clean and sparkling, I was hooked.<br /><br />For everything I've heard against the cast (mainly the Phantom), I thought everyone was stellar. Patrick Wilson was sensitive and believable as Raoul. You could feel his chemistry with Rossum -- like they really had known each other their whole lives. On that note, Emmy was AMAZING. For a sixteen-seventeen year old, her voice was beautiful. I loved Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again. And she proved that she can hold her own with the older guys in the production. &lt;Warning> I am now going to gush about the Phantom. :)<br /><br />Gerry made the show, and he definitely doesn't get enough credit for it... But I'll give people the benefit of the doubt and say that this is a free country where everyone has their own opinions. Anyway, contrary to what others have said, his singing may have been overdone, but it's an opera! Opera is supposed to be over the top, people, come on! ...Plus he's so handsome that whatever wrong notes he hits, he makes up for it in some way, shape or form later in the film. Where Michael Crawford's voice held an edgy danger, Butler's has a sensual caress. Music of the Night is a prime example: Gerry purrs every verse, and makes everything flow so beautifully. Oh, and Point of No Return... no words for that one, it's so breathtaking. For both Gerry and Emmy. I'll stick with Wandering Child as my favorite song because I totally love the violin solo at the beginning, and the way his voice just seeps into you.<br /><br />Minnie Driver definitely stole some of the show. Memorable moment: Il Muto and the world's first croaking diva! Yay! Miranda Richardson was also a very good choice -- she was able to play both sides of the fence very well.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderfully cast, beautifully designed, brilliantly done film that deserved more awards than it won. Very sophisticated for a musical piece. Go see it.the beginning, and the way his voice just seeps into you. <br />Minnie Driver definitely stole some of the show.

B00003CXSP|3.0|While the first two parts of this trilogy easily allowed me to suspend my disbelief and enter the most bizarre mind imaginable, this last one is so graphic and unsubtle that I kept saying to myself, \\"oh c'mon.\\"  It seemed to me that this film did not have anything to add - afterall, how can you surpass \\"Silence\\"? - so it just got more graphically grotesque, in particular the final cooking scene.  Then Lector is so brazen and nonchalant, toying with those who are pursuing him and barely escaping, that it is unconvincing.<br /><br />Clarice develops, as she is older and disillusioned.  Moore is a truly wonderful actress, so empathetic and believable.  It really is a pity that the script is so weak, as this could have been a great film based more on her - and the way her career is messed up - than Hopkins cunning and skill at killing (and eating).  The addition of Oldman does not fail completely, but his personality is somewhat undeveloped, though the way he lures Lector to him is quite subtle.<br /><br />So this film has its good moments, just not nearly as good as it could have been with a better script.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats in mind, but only fans of Lector will want to own this.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I agree with the last reviewer maybe they changed from By The Way because of the critizism. <br />But I do not agree intaily, first of Jupiter is like By The Way, and i love Jupiter because of that, but then Mars brings a totatlly differant sound never heard by the Chili's. <br /> <br />So Jupiter is just a cd filled with what you would expect them to do, and that makes Jupiter a great cd and then comes Mars which is a differant style which i love just as much as Jupiter. <br /> <br />I hope everyone understands me here. <br />I mean the album is brilliant and I'd even pay 20 dollars for it. <br />Because its like purchasing two differant albums! <br />Thank you.
B00004YA66|5.0|Frequency is a very good movie. It's entertaining and suspenseful the entire way through. The actings great and the story's even better. <br /> <br />I'll admit that the beginning of the film starts off kind of slow. They really try to develope the characters in a great way. There are a few moments were I wonder why it wasn't edited better. After the first 40 minutes the movie really picks up and it doesn't stop until the end. <br /> <br />Quaid gives the performance of his career. Caviezel puts on an excellent show in his role. Andre Braugher gives an outstanding performance also. There were a few weak performances, but not many. <br /> <br />It's a great story. One that really draws you in each second you watch. Definitely worth a rent or buy.
1400079179|1.0|I own the book. Bought it 3 months after it was released thanks to the extreme media fervour. It seemed this one the book that did no wrong.. the perfect book.. plot-wise, fantasticlly merging fact with fiction. And supposedly based on true facts!<br /><br />In reality the book couldn't -despite my best efforts- keep me engrossed past the 100th page. The so-called facts are completely conspiracy based and left me feeling hollow- like I'd taken a big bite of air.<br /><br />I really do not understand the interest it generated. Was it because it 'claimed' to be based on factual dark secrets of the Catholic Church?<br /><br />If there was a 1/2 star rating, I'd have given it that.
0385512104|4.0|this book is about a teenage boy who is autistic its kind of like an a murder mystery. this boy christopher finds a dog who had been murdered and christopher wanted to know who killed him. he lives with his dad but later moves with his mom. this book is all about what goes on in the mind of an autistic person. also the ending is a totall surprise.   <br /> <br />this book is awsome becuase it really gives the reader a better underatanding of what autism is and how life is like when u have the disorder. its great because the author gives pictures that kinda help the reader unerstand what christopher is really going through. its like you are inside his mind and hearing his thoughts. so its a good book and i recomend reading it! <br /> <br />
B00000I8UJ|5.0|Man, what a tone DG had on his sax!!  There's not one note on this CD that doesn't sound like the best note ever recorded, not one that sounds out of place.  A very melodic, solid, swinging CD.  While Dexter seems to be firmly rooted in singable dance-band jazz, Sonny Clark's chromatic lines and voicings provide the perfect pull towards bop (a sort of soft-bop album, if there is such a thing).  This CD (and Hank Mobley's \\"Soul Station\\", another gem of the same caliber) should never be out of reach of your stereo if you like tenor sax, good piano playing, or just plain jazz.  Best money I ever spent, and I have 700 CDs. <br />Thanks!
B000002KKK|5.0|After three years of rest, Billy & Dusty & Frank returned as ZZ Top for Deguello (1979). With their beards grown out (the class Top image was born), the band shifted gears from the bard band boogie of their previous albums (and the near-country of their last, Tejas), and funked up their sound a bit. An image of the band as Texas pimps lurching about the streets like urban cowboys was established here. ZZ Top was now becoming synonymous with antic fun. The cartoony image of the band cruising around in custom-hot rods and ladies abound got its start here. Now this might make you think Deguello is a sell-out, but its one of ZZ Top's best. Billy Gibbon's plays some fine guitar throughout, combining his licks and tricks with brilliance. \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" is menacing funk that makes you wanna cruise hte streets at night. \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide,\\" makes you wanna cruise in the day, in all your finery. \\"Fool For Your Stalkings\\" is a dark and brooding love lament that sounds good when you;re alone at night. \\"Manic Mechanic\\" is kooky instumental (if you don't count the slowed down voice) that grooves as well. \\"Low Down In The Street\\" tells a fine story. One two tracks, all three guys play saxophone, calling themselves the lone wolf horns; of these two, Dusty Hill's \\"Hi Fi Mamma\\" is the swingin' best. <br /> <br />In short, Deguello is simply fun music that sounds good, makes you happy, and is played well. ZZ's on top.
6305212112|5.0|That's how a local Whistle Stop newsletter (The Weems Weekly) describes the family situation in Fannie Flagg's novel, and it underscores the fact that the two women were a couple. The film's portrayal of their live-in relationship is subtle, yet creative. <br /> <br />Fried Green is a certified Feel Good movie, containing many wonderful moments. One curious thing about the Making Of documentary is the asymmetrical allocation of interview time. Chris O'Donnell is barely in the movie, yet he gets a huge amount of interview time. No complaints on that level, as he was superb, but by contrast, Gary Basaraba who was magnificent as 'the cop with the crush on Idgie', Grady Kilgore, only had one tiny interview snippet. <br /> <br />The part where a pistol-packing Grady stands up to the Georgia Klan members who are attempting to whip Big George was one of the most stirring parts of the movie. <br /> <br />This is a great version, but in less than a week, there will be an Extended Anniversary version coming out, which will also include outtakes and deleted scenes. <br /> <br />One of the best movies you will ever see.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|It's really great to get to see how the life has changed for this intelligent mathematics man throughout the movie. It was a really sad ending to me, I heard that in real life, his wife had chosen to leave him alone instead of what happened in the movie. That is even depressing for people who knew his personal story.  <br />Russell Crowe, acts as John Nash, the main character for this film, who is a mathematical genius and Nobel Laureate. Russell Crowe did a great job, he can fully convey John Nash's innermost world, his soul and how his mental problems came out because of the pressure from his surroundings. It is really hard to express all these feelings and bring out the message of the life of John Nash. I really like watching Russell Crowe's film. <br />I am also happy with how the director had changed the ending different from the real story, with his wife staying with him and went with him to get the Nobel award. That change can make the audience feel better for him, and will honor him after watching this film. This film is very touching and inspiring, that we need to treasure the people surround us and we need to cherish everything we had.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I have never seen a movie that made me feel the way that this movie has. It brought back so many memories of my life some which I chose to forget. This DVD edition is especially awsome, as it shows so many bonuses that just blow my mind away. Thank you to everyone involved.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Setting & Theme(s): Castlerock, smallville, summer friends' adventure, life's lessons, solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown.   <br /> <br />This 1986 instant classic of Rob Reiner's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film.  The musical score is dramatic, it sets the tempo from start to finish, and it never misses a beat; each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie's unfolding, and you don't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding.  The lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient, lazy summer days of grandeur, to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity.  One can in Stand By Me favorably assume to watch: pie eating contests, leeches, trains, train dodging, mail ball, fancy cars, fancy footwork (i.e. Verno's beloved comb's freefall), cantenes (thought they disappeared w/ Ben Franklin's outlets), junkyard dog chases, and much much more.  The ending is the real gravy.  The narration is superb also.   <br /> <br />By far one of the favorite films of my youth.  Believe John Cusack can be seen playing the role of Gordy's football star elder brother?  Stand By Me is the childhood that big city life just doesn't afford, at least not anymore.  Everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses; rustic destination spots, like the ones presented in this movie, are still out there folks.  With a smidgen of ambition toward adventure, which will take your there, the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated.  Although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors.  <br /> <br />Five stars for Reiners finest photoplay.
1400032717|3.0|This book was about a boy named christopher who has autism.  He finds a dog dead (Wellington) and its a mystery to find out who did it.  He finds out a lot about how his Dad lies to him about pretty important things from the past.  He learns a lot on his journies and all the trouble he goes through to find out who did it because when he likes something then he really cares and it becomes very important to him.  He relates a lot to what he feels and becomes really dedicated to what he wants to find out and help Mrs.Shears with the loss of her dog.  He is a very caring person and the book has a lot of twisting turns and events that you wouldnt expect to happen.  The reason why i didnt find it very entertaining for myself was because it didnt have chapters or anything and the format was different and for a person that likes reading a little bit it was hard to get attached to the  book.

0517543052|5.0|This book launched a spiritual renaissance for an entire generation. It starts out as a personal memoir, a Western academic who travels to India and finds answers to questions he didn't realize his soul was asking. Then, in the middle, Ram Dass shares some of the higher teachings of India, but in a way that makes you feel you are listening to a really cool individual who is also your friend. It is impossible for Ram Dass to be preachy. He's too down-to-earth, too fun, too \\"us\\". (As someone who has heard him speak several times, I can assure you, he speaks and is just like he writes.) The last part of the book is a short list of source materials, books and such, for those who wish to delve further into the subject. This mini-tome is a good introduction for those investigating the spiritual path. For those already on such a path, Be Here Now reminds us what we're trying to do, and why. I highly recommend it.

The early adopters who bought the title have long since wished to see it upgraded, while other fans, who came into DVDs later on, have been unable to find it at all. It is the only 'big' sci-fi spectacle currently unavailable on DVD,\\" Pratt said.<br /><br />\\"Runner\\" stars Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah and won plaudits -- as well as two Oscar nominations -- for its dark, bleak vision of the future.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I'm not quite sure why so many people rate this film so low. Films often sacrifice historical accuracy for entertainments sake and, after all, they are entertainment, not documentaries. <br />While I thought the film was a little long, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Brad Pitt did a perfectly good job in hos role and most of the bashing seems to stem from personal dislikes of Mr Pitt, and not of the job he performed in this film.
0804102988|5.0|Rutherford is the greatest - and this book takes you back in time with excellent writing and descriptions that help you actually see the past vividly.

B000F1IQN2|3.0|Munich is the story of the aftermath of the tragic 1972 murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics. The story is well told, but full of detail that quite simply makes the movie way too long (2 hours 45 minutes).<br /><br />Munich follows how five men led by Eric Bana are put together to eliminate the Black September terrorists responsible for the massacre. The dialogue is good; the action is good when it's there; there is suspense and overall the movie is morbidly entertaining....Nothing like seeing terrorists get their just desserts.<br /><br />But Steven Spielberg has gone a bit overboard with unnecessary detail creating wide gaps in the action that makes an epic out of a story that could easily have been told in a much shorter amount of time.<br /><br />So if you've got almost 3 hours to kill, and you're looking for a realistic, detailed depiction of the events that occurred after the 1972 Munich massacre...this movie is a bullseye. If slow moving movies put you to sleep...nighty night.
0140177396|5.0|So I thought that I'd go back and read the classics.  I say read not reread, because most of them I've never read.  (My high school curriculum was lacking when it came to reading quality literature and children's books, military books, and teaching books make up practically all my reading.)  This book was so good and so short there is no reason why anyone out there hasn't read it yet.  I loved it so much that I am heading out to borrow some more of books written by Steinbeck.  Go get it!  Trust me.  Don't waste your time reading another review.  You could already be half way done with reading it by now.  Any one has the time to read this one and everyone should!

B000F6IOC0|4.0|I take it upon myself to ignore the critics when it comes to Horror/Fantasy films with vampires and werewolves, for they seem simply unable to enjoy these types of films as anything more than just entertainment.  This second film is more of a continuation from the first, and not so much a sequel, much like \\"Kill Bill 2\\" picked up where the first film left off.  The difference here is that the filmmakers now have more money to throw around (thanks to the first film being a success), and it can be seen in the sleeker visual effects and huge sets.  But all that would be boring without interesting characters to watch, most notably Kate Beckinsale who is stunning to look at even when she isn't kicking bad guys in the teeth with her platform boots and wearing that now signature wet-leather cat suit shining in the glare of a full moon.  All in all, this is an action-packed Horror/Fantasy film which by the time the credits were rolling had me second guessing every film critic on the planet with a negative opinion.  If you liked \\"Underworld\\" I guarantee you will like \\"Underworld: Evolution.\\"  This is, in essence, the second chapter to the story.  Thank you.
B000002UJQ|1.0|You know.....i think it is all just hype. <br />I have listened to this at least half a dozen times and there is nothing here. The brief moments when i wasn't thoroughly bored was merely because i was completely annoyed. What's with this guy's incoherent mumbling. What's with the general fuzziness of the music. I just don't get it. <br />Save your money and check e-bay, people are unloading these cheap.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|It's been almost four decades since MARY POPPINS and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS set the standard for cinematic nannies.  Now, Oscar winning actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson gives us a new Poppins for the millenium---NANNY MCPHEE.<br /><br />Seven of the most obnoxious little hellions are giving daddy Colin Firth and his 17 nannies (so far) one heck of a time.  A voice from somewhere informs Firth that Nanny McPhee is what he needs.  The usually lovely Thompson shows up in the title role, looking like a hag from fairy tale books, with one long tooth conspicously dangling from her mouth, and warts to boot.  Ah, but Nanny has a magical walking stick and it isn't long before she's got the kids doing exactly as told.<br /><br />The movie is suffused with lovely color and set work, ingeniously unusual costumes and a delightful sense of whimsy.  Thompson is perfect as Nanny; Firth is delightful as the father, and Angela Lansbury is far removed from Jessica Fletcher in her role as the ludicrous but loveable Auntie.  It's a fairy tale to entertain all ages and one of the most enjoyable family films in some time.
B000002H70|5.0|i admit i was never the biggest cure fan in the world. i thought kiss me, kiss me, kiss me had some great songs ('hot, hot, hot,' 'catch,' 'like cocatoos,' 'why can't i be you?' and, of course, 'just like heaven') and i was mildy amused by songs like 'the walk,' 'let's go to bed' and 'inbetween days.' i remember being in high school and watching postmodern MTV (when MTV actually had a redeeming quality) every night with that goofy host, kevin seal, and ocassionally catching a cure video (me, well, i was more in the DM camp instead of the cure). don't get me wrong, i liked the cure, but to my adolescent mind they couldn't top the mighty mode.<br /><br />however, my opinion of the cure forever changed when i saw the 'world premiere' of the video for 'fascination street.' who was this new cure? robert smith and co. always gleefully played in the darkness, but 'fascination street' seemed more purposeful and direct than previous cure songs i'd heard. it kept the cure's trademark darkness, but there was something else to it.  what was it? 15 years on i still don't know.<br /><br />i went to the sadly defunct crandall audio in orem, utah and bought 'disintegration' with my hard-earned lawnmowing money that week (i still have the old cd 'longbox' cd's used to come in).  nothing could've prepared me for the beauty of the album's opener (and standout, in my opinion), 'plainsong.'  everyone who's said 'disintegration' (appropriately titled, by the way) is a moody, atmospheric album is spot-on.  few albums drum up the raw emotions we all feel inside quite like 'disintegration.' it was an interesting blend of peddled-guitars, tinny bass, spooky synths, and robert smith's trademark yalps.<br /><br />it was shortly thereafter i saw the video for 'lullaby.' i thought i was having a nightmare. it's still a brilliant song and the second best song on the album (in my opinion). most of us will also probably feel some nostalgia for 'pictures of you,' and 'love song,' too. they're the kind of love songs that could only come from the cure.<br /><br />as someone else correctly noted, 'disintergration' is very much a concept album. how else do you explain every song coming in at 5+ minutes? (well, most anyway). in short, 'disintegration' is indeed the cure's defining moment, much like 'violator' was depeche mode's, 'the innocents,' was erasure's, 'earth sun moon' was love and rocket's, and 'technique' was new order's.  now that i think about it, the late 80's and early 90's had some truly great music. 1989, the year of 'disintegration,' is particularly noteworthy.<br /><br />if you're new to the 'movement,' 'disintegration' is essential listening. it's huge, bold, experimental, purposeful, direct, nebulous, moody, eerie, creepy, spooky, heartbreaking and ultimately beautiful.<br /><br />i'm still not a huge cure fan, but i'll disintegrate anytime.could only come from the cure.      as someone else correctly noted, 'disintergration' is very much a concept album. how else do you explain every song coming in at 5+ minutes?

B000002KB8|5.0|I would argue that this album is the first true metal album made and that Black Sabbath is the first true metal band. Certainly others have had influence and they cannot be overlooked. Metal would never have existed if bands like Led Zeppelin, Cream and Hendrix did not exist. But Sabbath was the first true heavy metal band. <br /> <br />If you listen to this album and you study it you will find that the guitar riffs and bass lines have been copied and modified on every metal album after this one. <br /> <br />The album is brilliant. It's evil. It is heavy metal defined for the first time. <br /> <br />Also, Dio is not the godfather of metal, Ozzy is.

B000BJS4TO|5.0|This music is so in sync with every aspect of the charactors and what is going on that it's kind of scary.  Genius is all I can say.  How subtle, how haunting.  My heart was actually hurting when I listened to it.  Perlman and Yo Yo Ma are paired perfectly together.  The score is magnificent.  I haven't felt so moved with music in a long time.  This CD makes me want to watch the movie over and over just to see and remember again what is going on at what part of the score.  I absolutely love it.  Makes me want to learn how to play the violin and cello.
0783226845|4.0|Hard to believe that it took Oscar so much time to finally give Al Pacino a well deserved Best Actor oscar.  In this movie, yes, he does overdo it at times, but his performance is mesmerizing and brilliant nonetheless.  He plays a blind Army veteran who takes his young aide off to New York to have one last fling before he commits suicide.  Chris O'Donnell is very good as young Charlie, who in spite of Al's nasty demeanor, finds himself really liking him and trying to prevent Al's suicide.  A subplot involved O'Donnell's witnessing a student prank that could result in his expulsion, and his decision not to squeal on the rich perpetrators.<br /><br />It's all a little too long, but there are some wonderful moments including the tango scene with lovely Gabrielle Anwar and Pacino's deliciously over the top defense of Charlie at the hearing.  An entertaining movie, with Pacino's Oscar well deserved.
B000003S16|5.0|The late 1970s was a period of reinvigoration and rediscovery for Robert Fripp-- in 1974, after dissolving King Crimson, Fripp withdrew from the music industry only to be drawn back a couple years later working with Peter Gabriel and the David Bowie/Brian Eno partnership.  A relocation to New York and musical reawakening due to the punk and new wave scenes burgeoning there led to the recording of \\"Exposure\\", Fripp's first and only \\"proper solo album\\" (his words, not mine). <br /> <br />Drawing on an unusual list of collaborators-- vocalists Daryl Hall (of Hall & oates), Terre Roche (the Roches), Peter Hammill (Van der Graf Generator) and Peter Gabriel with instrumental contributions by Tony Levin on bass, Barry Andrews (XTC, Shriekback) on organ, session man Sid McGinnis on guitar and drum contributions by Jerry Marrotta, Phil Collins (back when he was a drummer) and Narada Michael Walden, Fripp ends up with a pretty unusual stew.  The music is like King crimson dragged through a New York filter-- post-punk, new wave, progressive rock, art rock and others all come filtering through.  Commercial considerations limited some contributions-- Daryl Hall's label forced Fripp to remove some of his contributions for fear association with Fripp would damage his marketability (Hall's first solo album, \\"Sacred Songs\\", produced by Fripp, was also delayed several years by the label for the same reason) and a cover of \\"I Feel Love\\" featuring Blondie was stopped by their label, again for commercial concerns, but nonetheless \\"Exposure\\" works out to be one of those startlingly diverse and undatable albums. <br /> <br />From the start, this is an odd affair-- the first song (after an odd preface) finds Fripp, Hall (on piano), Levin and Walden sinking in to a punky almost stride groove on \\"You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette\\", with Hall's uncharacteristically aggressive vocal soaring over the fierce backing track.  But the album doesn't embrace this sound for long, moving between Crimson-esque instrumentals (\\"Breathless\\" and \\"Haaden Two\\", both with the sort of monsterous riffing that made Fripp's reptuation), explosive art rock pieces (rambling \\"Disengage\\", featuring a shouted, ranting vocal from Hammill, Roche and Hammill duetting over Fripp's pounding riffing on \\"I May Not Have Had Enough of Me But I've Had Enough of You\\"), an oddly venemous love ballad (swinging \\"Chicago\\", check Hammill's bizarrely tortured vocal) to simply lovely and beautiful balladry (the delicate clean-tone guitar driven \\"Mary\\", ably sung by Roche and what to my mind is the definitive version of Peter Gabriel's \\"Here Comes the Flood\\", with Gabriel's plaintive vocal backed by his piano and Frippertronics). <br /> <br />The problem is with an album this startlingly diverse and quite unlike so many other things Fripp's been involved in, it's highly likely that people who love Fripp's music may find this unlistenable.  But one of the things I love about \\"Exposure\\" is that in its diversity, it provides a number of opportunities for finding new things on repeated listens, and it really is a magnificent album. <br /> <br />This edition, however, provides a much smaller picture than the forthcoming (next week at the time I write this, so likely available by the time you read it) remaster of the album that Fripp is putting together-- it's being reissued as a double with the original mix and the \\"new\\" mix Fripp did in the mid '80s presented on separate discs, with the latter substituting the original Daryl Hall vocals for what was forced to be issued by record label politics, and also adds a handful of bonus tracks (unfortunately, the Blondie/Fripp \\"I Feel Love\\" did not surface on the reissue).  The new issue is well worth the upgrade.
0805047905|5.0|I received BROWN BEAR, BROWN BEAR, WHAT DO YOU SEE? as a gift, and have been reading it to my 9 month old baby since he was a week or two old. It is one of his two favorite books, the other being THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR. We have a good friend whose baby is almost two, and he loves this book as much as my son.<br /><br />Before I had a child, Eric Carle's illustrations were not my style. I did not read any of his books as a child, and they did not call to me as an adult. I love them now, and I can see how they speak to my son. The red bird and the green frog illustrations are special favorites. My son will study these and other pictures in the book and run a finger over interesting parts of the pictures, such as the frog's feet.<br /><br />Bill Martin's text is lovely -- simple and poetically rhythmic. \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see? / I see a Red Bird looking at me. / Red Bird, Red Bird, what do you see?\\" and so on. Some animals are realistic colors, such as the brown bear, while others, such as the purple cat and the blue horse, are not.<br /><br />For my son, I read it straight through. For our two year old friend, we make it more interactive by asking him to make the sounds that the animals make. He loves that.<br /><br />Now that my son is older, we spend longer on the last pages, where all the animals, etc., are listed again, with a small picture of each. I can see that he is starting to associate sound with the picture because he will point to the red bird (or whatever) when I ask him if he sees it.<br /><br />It is such a mesmerizing little book that my husband and I occasionally quote it to each other and laugh. Hundreds of repetitions have made BROWN BEAR, BROWN BEAR, WHAT DO YOU SEE? a treasured old friend (rather than its going stale, as I would have expected). I am delighted to know that we will likely have another year or two of reading it to our son.<br /><br />BROWN BEAR, BROWN BEAR, WHAT DO YOU SEE? was a baby shower gift that has been much treasured at our house. If you are shopping for shower gifts for someone, I recommend this book highly. And if you are shopping for a board book for your own child, I would say it will be hard to do any better, based on our experience.that has been much treasured at our house.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Just as a Doris Day romantic comedy doesn't apply just to blonde women, Brokeback Mountain doesn't apply to just gay men. In fact, the characters aren't particularly gay, certainly not in the sociological sense. What they are, is lonely, isolated--not just on the mountain, but in their inability to express their emotions--and when they find each other, it's like the fracturing of a dam.  <br /> <br />Yet, the walls of the dam remain. The time on Brokeback is temporary; unreal; in the real world, the men remain stifled. The Ledger character, in particular, is held back by his childhood traumas from allowing himself intimacy. So his marriage fails; his girlfriends leave; all he has to look forward to is the occasional return to the idyll of Brokeback Mountain with his friend. Both men need more from each other, but Ledger's character is unable, so fearful of intimacy that he uses the excuse of prejudice to deny himself the one relationship that means everything to him.  <br /> <br />Buy this movie not to see actions or speed, as that's not what the movie is about, but to receive the warning message and the wakeup call for all of us.

B000F3TBIO|5.0|I have been a Patton fan for a few years now, I have heard all of his work with various artists, and his solo joints. I am able to digest all of his music, even the most \\"out there\\" and experimental and I have been waiting for a coherent and structured album from Patton since Lovage the tomahawk albums and California. True he delves into the musical unknown and maps out strange paths and creates new sounds, but his structured work is so beautiful and awesome. California by Mr. Bungle is one of the best albums ever made, ALONG WITH kING FOR A DAY, FOOL FOR A LIFETIME BY fAITH nO mORE, Mit Gas by TOmahawk and Music to make love to your old lady by by Lovage.With the relase of Suspended animation and General patton, it seemed that a structured Patton album was not going to happen. He seemed content in the abstract and the unknown and the rumors of peeping tom seemed just to be rumors and nothing more. THen one day as I was surfing myspace.com i came across peeping toms page,a nd I was blown away to find out that Peeping TOm had finally released, after years of waiting for it to surface, and I will say that I am impressed and I love this album. Its structured Patton with special guests! Hip hop beats and instruments played by Patton himself and much electonic mumbo jumbo give this album a nice appocalyptic futuristic vibe. Throw in the ecclectic and sporadic vision of Mr. Patton and you have an amazing accesible album. Patton purists might have a problem with this one, because it deviates from what gave Patton a huge underground following, which is fantomas and Mr. Bungle and his self titled work. I personally think his new path, which delves into electronic and hip hop(General Patton and the xecutioners, Lovage, Peeping Tom)was the only place to go. Patton has lierally experienced all forms of music, why not hip hop and trip hop?
B000BT97AO|1.0|I GIVE FIVE STARS!!!  NOT ONE!  MY MISTAKE!!!I can't help but say that I loved this movie!  It was extremely visual and unique.  I've seen nothing like this ever before!  All I can say is you either hate it or like it.  What irritates me is people saying that it was too boring or they couldn't follow it.  My 9 year-old cousin understood it and the next day bought the DVD.  I just think people aren't open-minded anymore.
1400032717|4.0|The Book \\"The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time\\" is about a boy named Christopher who is handicaped, not physically but mentally. He finds a dog that has been killed at his neighbors house. His main goal throughout the book is him trying to figure out the mystery of who killed the dog. Over the course of the book, Christopher comes across many obsticles that he has to over come in his family, his school, his disability and in life. With all the things that get thrown at him in the book, he always overcomes his problems and finds a way to make things work.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book \\"The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time\\". I think it was a good book with a good moral behind it. The purpose of the book, i think, is to make people realize that they can do anything they set their minds too. If someone like Christopher can accomplish all the things he did in the book, anyone can do anything they set their mind to or be anything in life.
B000000WA4|5.0|If you consider yourself a music fan I would highly recommend listening to this album if you haven't already done so.  I believe it's some of the most masterpieceful music ever conceived.  All the Pumpkins albums are grade A top quality material but this one has grown to be my favourite just because it not only captures them during Corgan's era of prime song writing ability but the fact that it has so many songs that the amount of quality AND quantity exhibited throughout this record is enough to make it a timeless album that I will probably never stop listening to.

B00005JOYA|4.0|Let's just say it wasn't the best movie but I liked it.  The creatures were what made the movie for me!  They were so weird and creepy that it made Resident Evil and DOOM look like rag dolls!  I've never played Silent Hill and I heard if you have the movie will suck, but the movie makes me want to buy the original!  Anyway people are complaining that the FX look fake.  Well I did some research and found out that most of the creatures were people in costume!  HA!  And besides stop complaining about how real it's suppose to look!  You can't make everything look too real!  Do we play video games to complain about the graphics?  No!  We do it to have fun, that's what a movie is for.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|First off I havent listened to anything Patton has done recently with much consistency. I dig General Patton Vs. The X-Ecutioners , hell his avant stuff with fantomas and tomahawk are both good, but mostly Faith No More is what I know of him. I'd heard about this project for some time, and read that this (peeping tom), is what he  invisions pop music as. Or how it should be. I have to agree, most pop is rubbish, especially the kind that isnt written by the atists.     Utimately, this record has it all. He shows once again how versatile he is. Its very chill music, relaxing enough for any mood, yet has spunk enough to motivate you. Seriously its worth a listen, when you have a pioneer like Patton you know you're getting passion, a true artist. I dont care about the production help or cameos, since this is basically experimental it turned out to be a real gem that I enjoyed.
B000003TAN|5.0|I love this album!<br /><br />It's probably the only album in my record collection that finds it's place wether I'm in a Pop, Punk, No-wave, Electronic, or Urban mood or when I'm just sick and overloaded with American society.<br /><br />This album is an exorcism of American culture in the 1980s and is still relevant to todays times.  The destructive force of George W. Bush and the brainless celebrities we're bombarded with daily, who eat away our brains as G.W.B. eats away our lives and our civil liberties, all the while we witness the worst disasters in history, are akin to Ronald Reagan and America's obsession with Dynasty and Dallas while nearly an entire population of creative people die of AIDS and the worst plague of world hunger in history wipes out 35,000 people a day.<br /><br />The contrasts that people point out, &#34;the darkness and Pop irony&#34; make this album such a great document of the underground.  Never forget that Madonna started out in a Punk/New Wave band (The Breakfast Club) and was a part of the early Hip-Hop and Club scenes that many NY Punks were going to.  The underground in the 80s was a melting pot of styles and scenes all effecting each other through music, performance, art and fashion.<br /><br />Instead of being phony purists of Avant-Garde taste, like most NYC Hipsters were and are, stepping in line to the same definition of &#34;Cool&#34;, Ciccone (Sonic) Youth are honest about their appreciation and disgust with pop culture and express what it feels like to be an informed, creative and individualist person finding that you actually do like Madonna and in a cold, minimalist way the Robert Palmer girls are actually quite bizarre, like something from a Kraftwerk or Klaus Nomi performance.<br /><br />So, to sum this up.  If you find your sick of the monotonous goose-step of indi./alt./underground music these days, crank this up, turn up the bass and excorscise your Mtv induced/social crisis/media disease demons.<br /><br />- Michael Wileyartarano

Ummm...<br /><br />Maybe not if your Master is immortal.<br /><br />Mort is soon sent out on his own to 'release' dying souls from their bodies, and (this is the best part) he gets to ride Death's big white horse, Binky.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My wife and I just spent the last two weeks watching Firefly and Serenity for the first time.  I am astounded that this show was taken off the air as it seems to have a little something for everyone, and was very intelligently written with a nice gradually expanding storyline and awesome character development.  It's also funny as \\"heck\\". <br /> <br />I'm glad this amputated series has some sense of closure in the movie...but that was unsettling in it's own right. <br /> <br />There are many similarities with Cowboy Bebop, but that ain't all bad:D  <br /> <br />As of today, I feel sorry for network TV (and us) that shows like this do not succeed in the market.  Maybe it was too smart and involved for it's own good?  Other shows with a simliar feel have also been axed before their time....Freaks and Geeks and Brisco County Jr. come to mind. <br /> <br />I'll be in mourning for a long while on this one....
0618477942|5.0|I was slightly familar with Alison's comic strip. <br /> <br />This book blew me away! <br /> <br />I am a biography junkie and this one is truly amazing.  It reminded me of \\"Harriet the Spy\\" meets your typical GLBT coming out story-- but sort on acid.  In fact, Alison's drawings gave me the same thrill that I got when I was 11 and discovered \\"The Long Secret.\\" No one's artwork or story have moved me in the same manner since. <br /> <br />The visual images are fantastic and the \\"characters\\" drawn with great love and much depth.  I was totally moved, and inspired. <br /> <br />This was the first graphic novel I have ever bought or read. Alison is fantastic.  Thank for sharing your amazing story.
B000068FXR|4.0|When I first heard this album as a young man, it seemed to have a 50ish type of quality to it.  It certainly was a positive album when compared to the preceding dark masterpiece entitled, \\"Crime of the Century.\\"  The integrity of the songs are certainly maintained as in the prior one, but I think more thought should have been put into the order that they were played.  The bluesome style of Rick Daves always seemed to keep Roger Hodgeson's pop in balance. As a result, Roger seems to be represented too much in the album and it goes a bit over the top towards the end.  By the way, I read that they cut a demo of this album in a single day, while sitting in the middle of the busy offices of the recording company.  They really impressed the music executives, with their genius and musical capabilities.
B00006HAZG|5.0|Having purchased this movie without ever having seen it, I was a little apprehensive that I would wind up disappointed. David Copperfield is without question one of my top 3 all tme favorite novels, and I was really hoping to see it done the justice I feel it is owed. The BBC did not let me down.  <br />     The beautiful scenery, and the phenomanol performances blend together to bring the novel to life with all the color and richness Dickens deserves. I personnally loved the performances of Hoskins as Micawber, and Maggie Smith simply steals every scene she is in playing the eccentric Betsy Trotwood. Also big Kudos I thought to Trevor Eve for his brilliant portrayal of the truly despised Mr. Murdstone. <br />   I can only hope any future film versions of this novel can live up to this one.  <br />
0066620996|5.0|Good to great is a good book analyzing the real world companies that went from good to great.  The author, Jim Collins, also talked about the companies that did not become great.  I think this is a good book to look at and to see what methods to follow and be done to become a great company.  The levels he talked are hard to follow so many companies could not become great (not that the companies followed his levels).  It is an easy read book with a cup of coffee in your backyard on Sunday mornings.  The topics flow properly using examples and analyzing the situation of different companies.  Nice to read the book
006019250X|5.0|If stories were paint and words a paintbrush, this is one peice of art I would visit in a galary everyday -just to look at it. Nothing else, just look at it. The picture the author has painted with this story is inpiring and goes very well with another book that is, sadly, out of print: A Champion Lies Within. <br /> <br />Although I read a slighlty different version earlier in my life, when I saw the Illustrated version of the Alchemist at a random yard sale- I had to have it for my collection.  <br /> <br />Its not even the story itself that is so grand - Although it is well written and illustrated, I'd say that its message is one that the world should hear.  <br /> <br />Pick it up! It doesnt take long to read but the on-going lessons that it provides are a real treat. Besides being provokative- if you just want a good read it is very entertaining! I know you will love it - as well as many others by the same author.  <br /> <br />And all you others... stop complaining so much about all this neo-pagan neo-christian Stuff! Its like refusing to look at a painting just because it was done by a german or a jew or something. Take it for what it is, take what you WANT out of it and stop griping about what you DONT want because that helps no-one.  <br /> <br />That said- I gladly give it 5 stars. ~Enjoy <br /> <br />

B0001EKZOQ|5.0|If you like the music, You will love this CD. It doesn't matter if you are from Europe, Asia, USA o any other place. <br />Somebody said that bolero and flamenco are too different to creat something in common. Well, in my opinion that's not true. For both styles you need passion and a some kind of feeling. <br />Here, you will find a lot of that with the performances by Bebo and Dieguito El Cigala. Music full of soul and with a taste of sadness and melancholy presented by two maestros the great piano man, Bebo valdes and the young star of the cante flamenco, Diego El Cigala. Thank you for everything Mr. Trueba!!!
B000002IOJ|5.0|Testament's first 2 albums are typical thrash albums with great songs on it. Testament's breakthrough album is Practice What You Preach - a more polished album with more melodies and catchiness. The songs aren't as thrashy or as fast as the previous albums but it still sounds and feels like Testament. This is one of my favorites currently and I just love the music this band comes up with!! \m/
B000002BYD|5.0|This album changed the way that I see the world around me and put me on a new course of thought. I saw an earlier review that said,\\"If everyone had this album the world would be a much better place\\", and I tend to agree. With 'Yield', Pearl Jam weaves a quilt of music and themes together which are life affirming and inspirational. The message of the album is there for the taking and never reaches a point of being preachy or heavy handed.  The album itself is a meditation on life and the unity all. I'd also recommend Daniel Quinn's book 'Ishmael' as a companion piece to this work of art. 'Ishamael' was allegedely used by the band as inspiration in the creation of the album. This is truly a stellar album.
B00005JLF5|5.0|This had it's moments, but none of them were terribly weak.  <br /> <br />Firstly, let me say I am a HUGE fan of Avery Brooks (Hawk in 'Spencer for Hire') and Rene Auberjonois is great. Then came the newcomers. <br /> <br />The first, best strength of DS9 as a series is that it can get away with story arcs (3-part and even 8-parts) can be fulfilled. You don't have the curse of having a 35 minute problem, 8 minute solution and then 2 minutes of fillers. <br /> <br />There is a huge amount of humor in this series too. The interplay between Odo and Quark is GREAT! My favorite lines from the whole season: <br /> <br />QUARK: How did you know? <br />ODO: You told me that your brother Rom fixed the replicators. <br />QUARK: So? <br />ODO: You're brother's an idiot. He couldn't fix a straw if it was bent. <br /> <br />That one kills me and leads to a lot of Quark protestations and Odo harrumphings down the line. Great work here. <br /> <br />The religious factioning on Bajor is important, though it's a lot of the focus of the first two seasons ('The Circle' for example in Season Two). However, Season One works to iron out the kinks of any new season. It is MUCH stronger than TNG and Voyager. Please, let's not even go on about that parody of a series called \\"Enterprise\\". <br /> <br />Strong characters, strong writing and great acting make this easily the best series. I can say that I am not in the least bit unhappy to have purchased the whole thing.  <br /> <br />Other episodes later on after the Dominion comes into the fold and the Cardassians are given a new fold on diabolical nastiness (do you ever feel comfortable with Garak as a \\"simple tailor\\"?), you REALLY get sucked into the Trek Universe. <br /> <br />Outstanding series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|This movie was great.  I must admit, I was skeptical at first, but the more we learned about the characters (especially Stanley/Bree) the more I loved the movie.  It was about finding yourself and acceptance, but not the way you think.  I think that the tolerance the Bree showed her/his son and the love that was given, unconditionally, spoke volumes about her character.  And this movie also taught me that the things that you want most in life may not complete you the way that you think.  <br /> <br />I can't really review this one without giving away spoilers.... <br /> <br />BTW - Until I watched the bonus features I had no idea that Bree was being played by a woman.  Wow.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is a great metal album by Metallica. ...And Justice For All is clearly one of their best works musically and lyrically with maturing on both sides. The progressiveness is just as great as the heaviness of this CD. This CD is taken down a notch on sound with the emptiness on the bass side, but when songs from this record are performed live it just blows people away and this might be Metallica's heaviest album ever - songs like Blackened, Dyers Eye, And Justice For All - all great and features the last masterpiece to be created by the late great Cliff Burton. I would love to see this album remastered in the future with bass and hear the pounding drums, thick guitar sounds, thumping bass, and gruff vocals - the way it should've sounded!!

0670813028|5.0|This book reminded me of The Stand. Seven teenagers discover an unholy terror in their town and make a stand against it.

B000EHSVQ4|3.0|In addition to its wide-ranging battle scenes and handsome production values, Ridley Scott's Medieval epic \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" boasts a greater complexity of character and depth of theme than we are accustomed to finding in a film of this type.  Although set in the late 12th Century, the film has a great deal of relevance to the world of today, seeing as how the Christian West and the Muslim East are once again at each others' throats much as they were back then.  Only the names and the weaponry seem to have changed.  With an eye towards fairness, perhaps, the movie makes it very clear that there are men of war and men of peace on both sides of the conflict, although, if the truth be told, the Christians come out slightly less noble than their Islamic counterparts in the film.<br /><br />By the time the story begins, the Crusades have been waging on and off for nearly a hundred years already.  And although a fragile peace seems to have taken a temporary hold in the Christian-ruled city of Jerusalem, forces from both without and within are threatening to rend the tender garment holding that peace together.  Orlando Bloom plays the young blacksmith, Balian, son of the beloved Sir Godfrey (Liam Nissan), who is hoping to find his redemption for killing a priest by becoming a knight and dedicating his life to defending that holiest of cities to the best of his abilities.<br /><br />Beyond its rather excessive running time, the biggest weakness in the film is Bloom himself who makes for a very bland, very pallid central figure, one whose \\"romance\\" with Sibylla, the queen of Jerusalem, is the least interesting aspect of the film.  However, there are fine compensatory supporting performances by Liam Nissan, Jeremy Irons and Ghassan Massoud as the great Islamic leader, Saladin, who, like Balian, is portrayed as almost a reluctant warrior in this titanic struggle for religious domination.<br /><br />And indeed, it is the sociopolitical parallels that the film draws between its own time and ours that ultimately lifts \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" a rung or two above the ordinary.hat ultimately lifts \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" a rung or two above the ordinary.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|Really. t's too bad there isn't more of this for me to buy. I have bought both her CDs and have enjoyed them. Her music is classic. Music I will be listtening to for a long time. Really nice to listen to when in a relaxed mood. I'll let other discribe the music in detail, I'll just say I'm very happy to have bought her CDs.
B000B8QF14|3.0|If you are a die-hard fan don't read this review... you've already bought the CD-DVD and will keep it no matter what. Plenty of other people have talked about the DVD but let's just focus on the CD here. I consider myself a Green Day fan. American Idiot, Nimrod, Dookie... genius, but this concert CD is pretty lousy. It's pretty much a regurgitation of American Idiot's best with plenty of extra f-bombs sprinkled in to get some big screams. That coupled with Billy Joe constantly yelling \\"England\\" and renouncing his US citizenship was pretty weak for audience interactment. They pull out only seven other songs from previous CDs. That's lame for a live album. I hoped this one would be one of those classic concert CDs like U2's \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\", The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\", or Peter Gabriel's \\"Secret World Live\\" but it's not. The studio albums have all of the energy you'll want so buy those before you buy this.
1400079179|5.0|I gave in to the hype and finally read this book. Even though my faith rejects the premise of the book, I don't take it too seriously as this book was purchased in the fiction section of my local bookstore. I found the book to be a thriller that intertwines mystery and action with religious conspiracy theory. It was page turner that kept me on edge from start to finish. I look forward to reading another one of Brown's books.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica brings me back to my \\"beginning of High School\\" days. That was 16 years ago, and it never did get old. While in essence, Hetfield and Ulrich deviated some in recent works, they never succumed to the naysayers who couldn't understand their music. \\"And Justice for all\\" evokes madness, demanding of justice, and pure adrenaline. <br />It is as if Ulrich was brought down from the drum gods, soley to satiate his fans in the uncontestable \\"One.\\" His bone-busting slams force your heart to skip a beat or two.  <br />Hetfield stays raw and heartfelt from beginning to end on this album. <br /> <br />I long to hear bass via Burton, but I think the boys did an honorable job in his absence. <br />Another song, in addition to \\"One\\" in the way of a uniquely Metallica sound is \\"The Shortest Straw.\\" Most of the old stuff jibes. The boys stay consistent, yet are able to bring new issues and feelings to the table at will.  <br />You will never find a better album than \\"And Justice for All.\\" <br />  <br /> <br />

0142000671|5.0|I thought this story was so good after I got done reading it!!! It showed me that even when you have to make hard chioces, people normally what's best for everyone else so that nothing else happens!!!  This story is about two men by the names of George ans Lennie. They are two hard working farm boys who get into some trouble... well actually, Lennie gets them into some trouble. So they have to go find another job and so on and so forth. But that's not what the story is really about. The story is really about making the right choices even when the outcome isn't always as good for you!!! I thought this was such a good book, and I would recamend that anyone read this story, because it really makes you think about those kind of things!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|Released in 1996, right from the start you know this 77 minute album is going to be a masterpiece. The four members of Tool; Maynard James Keenan, Danny Carey, Adam Jones and Justin Chancellor, come from different parts of the United States (Except Justin - he's from the UK), but Los Angeles is where their collective creativeness began in the early 90s.    There are many standout tracks on this album (In fact every song is excellent) along with thought provoking interludes. The opening track _Stinkfist_, is a `straightforward' rocker which displays the band's more aggressive side, both lyrically and musically. This is then quickly followed by _Eulogy_. This song is very much progressive rock and it showcases Jones' guitar play, which is a real sonic assault on one's ears, often explosive and sometimes eerie. The lyrics of this song, I believe, deal with the death of the late but great Bill Hicks. Hicks was an outstanding stand up comedian, friend of the band, and without a doubt, a strong source of inspiration for the group's socially and spiritually critical lyrics.     Perhaps the best song on the album, however, is the title track. Maynard James Keenan is one of the most distinctive and powerful vocalists in heavy music today. MJK describes the city of Los Angeles, saying it should receive an `enema', \\"Flushing it all away\\".  Maynard's vocals are particularly powerful and potent here. The song also contains many intricate and precise drum rhythms.    The lyrical and musical complexity of this album is nearly infinite, it's an album that one can listen to for years and still discover new treasures here and there. Over the years, Tool have created music that can only be described as progressive, transcendent and futuristic. AEnima is a timeless classic. Just buy it!
1416524800|3.0|\\"Deception Point\\" is another Dan Brown novel which again proves that he is one of the most gifted writers in the thriller/mystery genre. The novel embarks on a battle to be the next American President with President Herney and Senator Sexton battling it out in attempt to have America on their side.<br /><br />After reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown, I decided to explore his other novels to see whether they are as good as his best selling book. I must say that although the novel was a good read, the plot was rather predictable.<br /><br />When one of NASA's satellites detect a meteorite with evidence of extraterrestrial life embedded in the Arctic ice, we believe President Herney will win the presidential election after Sexton sarcastically remarks that he will \\"eat his hat\\" if NASA makes any discoveries of life beyond earth. Herney decides to call Rachel Sexton, the White House Intelligence analyst to confirm the authenticity of the meteorite to his staff. However, along with a group of bright, smart scientists and experts, Rachel discovers that there is something wrong with the meteorite and after being shot at in the Artic by a group of anonymous men, Rachel Sexton, oceanographer Michael Tolland and prize winning astrophysicist learn one of the boldest deceptions made by NASA.<br /><br />As well as embarking on another one of Dan Brown's thriller novels, I learnt a lot about the political side of America and the NASA space program, demonstrating Brown's thorough research for this novel.
1400095913|3.0|In the end, this wasn't bad, but at first I was a little annoyed that the author went out of his way to make sure that readers wouldn't feel too guilty about liking serial killer Dexter Morgan.  After all, we're told Dexter only kills other killers (and only the most reprehensible killers, at that) and only became a serial killer himself because of some hinted-at horrible abuse he suffered as a child.  That's all fine, but- I don't know- I just wish that the author was a little more subversive and/or darkly humorous and didn't make it quite so safe for us to like Dexter.<br /><br />But things got a little better as the book progressed, as Dexter- in a darkly playful move by the author- begins admiring the \\"artistry\\" of a particularly nasty serial killer being chased by the Miami cops.  And I liked the ending moments, when we see (don't worry, I won't get too specific) Dexter cross the line a bit and allow some serial killer nastiness not strictly in line with his \\"kill only other killers\\" policy.  Those elements gave the book some crackle and energy, and some bravery, as it dared us to like a guy capable of truly terrible things, not just somewhat terrible things.<br /><br />On a technical note, though, I'm glad that the paperback edition of \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" included as a bonus the opening chapter of the second Dexter novel, \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\".  I'm glad because it was sketchy and not completely clear regarding who did what in the closing confrontation scene at the end of the first novel, but when Dexter reflects back on the incident in the bonus opening chapter of the second book, it's definitely clear what happened in the closing moments of book one.<br /><br />In the end, I'm not totally sold on the concept of a scary, monster-ish guy who is also kinda/sorta a good guy, too.  But I think there was enough interesting stuff here that I'll likely check out \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\" once it comes out in paperback.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|The title of my review says it all. After watching the comments of those involved in writing, directing, and acting in the film it's obvious they didn't understand Austin's plot. They don't understand the customs of the time period. They didn't get the fact that Austin's book is humorous. At one point in an interview the screenwriter says the story revolves around Lizzie's pride and Darcy's prejudice. When in fact in Austin's novel it was Miss. Bennett's prejudice and Darcy's pride that caused their conflict. The screenwriter also didn't get the fact that Mr. Bennett held his wife in total contempt in Austin's story. He made fun of her in front of their children. And it was this element in the Bennett's relationship that drove the two older sisters to insist on marrying for love. They didn't want to be in marriages where they couldn't love and respect their spouses. The scenery in the movie is lovely--but too rustic. I doubt the Bennett's in Austin's novel had a large boar running through their house. And Mr. Bingley was a complete fop in this movie version. Donald Southerland reminds me of Lee Marvin in Cat Baloo. Mrs. Bennett looks and sounds like a fishwife. All in all--I cannot give it a high rating. If you want to see Pride & Prejudice--watch the Colin Firth version. It's a whole lot closer to Jane Austin's original story.
074325144X|4.0|I'm giving this book a 4 because it's a great start, and there is a major glut of books on running technique (thousands on running, but most are about training regimens and that is something far less important than technique--or at least should come after, and not before). The book loses a star because it is off base on a few things.    I have been running recreationally for over a decade and took up competitive running last year. I get top 10% in local foot races and recently got 9th in a 300+ person triathlon.    I used to be a low-cadence heel striker. I'd tried all the solutions of shoes, muscle imbalance, excess weight, etc. but none solved my chondromalacia (knee cap cartilage wearing). I bought this book because I knew I needed a new technique and I knew that most good runners were either mid strike or forefoot strikers.    I read this book and did my best to apply it but ultimately, things just did not \\"click\\". The author promotes a midfoot strike (landing \\"flat footed\\", though the lateral part of the foot will hit first). This is a tried-and-true method that a great many accomplished elite runners use. He also promotes a ~90 cadence, which almost all good running coaches agree on. He also promotes a minimalist shoe, which a lot of elites use and it makes perfect sense (have the body absorb impact, don't rely on a shoe, which doesn't even do a good job anyway) These are all spot-on. Something I could never get, though, was his insistance that calf muscles are not used much in midfoot striking. They are and in fact I continued to heel strike, no matter what I did, until I started pointing my toes a bit to flatten the foot, which requires calf pressure. I also found his sand technique (practicing keeping even pressure on front and back of the foot), frankly quite silly. I have watched dozens of videos of elite runners and you will not find a single competitive one who is not launching off the ball of their foot--it being the last point of contact with the ground). This final launch requires calf strength as well.    Another fallacy I see promoted not just by the author, but my other coaches these days, is that the forward lean produces power. Of course it produces none whatsoever. Gravity does not assist with horizontal movement. If a person starts a run on a flat surface and their body never goes down in height, gravity has had no net control of it and therefore none of its force can be translated into a horitzonal force. Gravity does not provide running power, PERIOD. It merely gives the foot the ability to push without breaking from the ground (its coefficient of friction working with gravity's force)...it pushes away from the body (and using Newton's law the body then moves away from the foot). The body has no net vertical movement during a run (it bobs up and down and the lean goes forward and back in a tiny see-saw depending on leg position, but no net vertical movement) and since gravity is a vertical force, it produces no horizontal force. This is basic physics but I see a lot of people not understanding it. Apparently, many people are confused by the fact that when a person is standing up right and then leans forward, they do in fact move forward, but this significant vertical->lean activity is not repeated in a manner than can provide forward movement. With the body ahead of the foot at lift-off, the body will come towards the ground, but to prevent it from smashing into the ground after a few strides, a corrective force has to be applied, which is the foot going out in front of the body.    It's impossible for a runner at constant speed to strike the ground only under or behind their center of gravity. I won't bother getting into why with much detail, but again, nobody here will be able to find an elite athlete (sprinter or long distance runner) at constant speed (excusing the acceleration of a sprinter, when they are able to strike always behind the center of gravity) striking only under or behind the centerof gravity. If you don't believe me, find a vid and pause at the exact moment of contact. The foot is ahead of the gcm. Dreyer says as a person speeds up their stride should open behind them and not ahead of them. Impossible. Again, I refer to elite athletes. I've watched 10 second sprinters. All of them have an increased stride and it opens up behind and ahead. If a person applies some basic physics so the matter, it's very easy to understand why. The author also says that as a person increases in speed they should actually feel more relaxed. I again defy anybody to find a 4 minute miler who says they feel more relaxed after that than after their 6 minute miles.    The book IS decent, it's just not entirely accurate or possible. Taking these exceptions above to heart, the rest of it is filled with generally good advice.     I am currently forefoot running (my heel rarely, if ever touches the ground), based upon coaching techniques from other sources. My knee pain has greatly decreased and I recently broke my best mile time. I don't chirun not because I don't think it's valid (it mostly is, but there are a couple of aforementioned problems) but because the exercises recommended simply didn't work for me...I could never \\"get\\" it, but the greatest thing I was missing was the calf tension; when I finally started putting more effort in my calves and plantar flexing my foot (pointing my toes), things came and now I can forefoot run and midstrike run with ease, so anybody having problems may benefit from trying that.    The book is a good start. I will not return to heel striking ever. I continue to spend a good bit of time researching running technique from various sources, which is why I take issue with some of the fallacies promoted about running and some of the physical impossiblities that people pretend are possible.
0804106304|5.0|Amy Tan creates a small short plot that takes up about 10-20 pages.  The rest of the book is getting the reader very intimate with the characters and the situation of adapting to American life.<br /><br />The characters of this book are real.  The situations are also real.  Anyone close to an Asian-American can attest to these types of stories.  Tan does a great job of showing how the children grow up American and are unable/unwilling to relate to their parents.  Teenage rebellion takes on new meaning when you are also rebelling against your parents culture.  Tan does not paint china with elaborate imagery, but paints it in the readers mind with characters and actions that are foreign to western minds.  The story is told in a non-linear method that adds to this foreign feel.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone.  There is very little suggestive or violent content.  Amy Tan deserves the praise that she has received for this book.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I saw this movie on the 4th of July it was a special screening in Ann Arbor MI. At this I not only saw an excellent documentary but the mother from flint who is in the movie was also there. Unlike one reviewer stated that she was somehow tricked by Moore, she spoke quite passionately about how she thinks that the war should have never taken place and specifically addressed the fact that people do come up to her and ask her about her part in the film and if she knew of Mr. Moore's agenda. She also said that she got the final say of what was included in the movie about her and her son's story. I felt that it was important that people knew this and did not get the wrong idea about that part of the movie.
B000005DQR|5.0|Endtroducing is the debut album of DJ Shadow, aka Josh Davis. He produces a variety of sound in this album, but manages to mix it all together so it's unique but distinctly Shadow. With a meld of trance, rhythm and bass, hip hop, and music from the 60s, DJ Shadow produces an amazingly fresh sound that has been almost unrivaled by anyone today. The second track (Building Steam With a Grain of Salt) and last three tracks (Midnight in a Perfect World, Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain, and What Does Your Soul Look Like Part 1 Blue Sky Revisit) particularly stand outto me for their smoother flow, and 2, 12 and 13's greater use of piano. Samples do this album no justice. For those who are fans of Radiohead and/or Mix Master Mike, chances are you'll love this album and many of the others that follow.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|First of all, General Patton and Suspended Animation were much more alternative than this album is. While I enjoyed some of the General Patton stuff, I never really got in to Suspended Animation. This is certainly more accessible, and is by far one of Patton's more mainstream projects, but as has been said previously this is still some way off pop as it is known today. <br /> <br />As Mike Patton himself said, this is HIS version of pop, so it is not a pop record in the truest sense. Which is good, because I'm not a big fan of pop. I am a big fan of Patton, however, and in my opinion this album is very good. <br /> <br />It's classic Patton. He does the straight singing (and he does it very well) as well as the more airy sort of vocals (ala Stripsearch), and a little bit of the raspy stuff, but no screaming though. All of the tracks are greatly enhanced by the featuring artists. Standouts for me include: Five Seconds, Mojo, We're Not Alone (Remix), Sucker, Kill the DJ and Don't Even Trip. Which is pretty much the whole album. The other songs I am sure will grow on me, but at the moment these are the ones that I am listening to. <br /> <br />So, I guess all that I am doing now is echoing the views of the other reviewers here. But I just wanted to be another to show my appreciation of this record. And yes, the case is very cool. Ipecac have got the whole music thing down to a tee, from the incredible musical talent on display through to the packaging. Can't fault it one little bit. <br /> <br />Sure, so there are some blandish tracks, but only very rarely does a 100% brilliant album come out. On the whole, this is a must-have - for any Patton fan and for anyone who shys away from the mainstream. Recommended.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Anchorman is a stupid movie but it works.  It doesn't pretend to be anything otherwise.  This was the perfect vehicle for Ferrell and wouldn't have worked without him.  As Ron Burgundy, he's a tacky, sexist, perverse, egomanic and it's hilarious.    <br /> <br />For those who haven't seen it, Anchorman takes place in 1970's San Diego.  Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) heads a local news team who are worshipped like Gods by the public.  Their reign at the top is shaken when a woman is hired to work at the station.  Ron and his band try their hardest to force her to quit, but he begins to have feelings for her.  The rest you'll have to watch and find out.   <br />The plot is pointless, but let me say that if you find Ferrell and his brand of comedy hilarious (NOT Bewitched), you will love him in this.  Fan's of Saturday Night Live will detect a bit of his Robert Goulet impression in Ron.  It's worth a look for the laughs even if it is pointless and stupid.
B000000W5P|5.0|Some Girls is a fantastic album. It has an excellent blend of styles, rocks HARD, and finds Jagger digging a bit deeper into his lyrical treasure chest to make some spot-on comments about the band, the times, and women. The oft-made reference to the influence of punk rock is more evident in Jagger's in-your-face messages than in a thousand versions of \\"Shattered.\\" \\"When The Whip Comes Down,\\" the title track, \\"Lies,\\" and others all harken back to the days when Jagger sang about women, sex, drugs, and the state of the world. You'd have to go back to the mid 60s for songs as biting as \\"Some Girls.\\" I also think that this album marks a break from the sound of the 70s albums and gives a glimmer (sorry) of the next decade.<br /><br />Keith's number is arguably his best, certainly on par with \\"Happy,\\" and never matched since, the careening insanity of \\"Respectable,\\" with Ron and Keith on riff overload, the delicate beauty of \\"Beast of Burden,\\" and the wry and cheeky \\"Far Away Eyes,\\" a song that would fit well on Exile On Main Street, create an excellent and concise piece of rock and roll. I'm not too thrilled with their Motown cover (never have been too keen on their Motown covers at all), but it isn't enough to take away from this gem. There are a handful of Rolling Stones albums that define the band and this is one of them.
B00006AW2M|3.0|Being an exception to 2 major rules of rock 'n roll fandom makes it much easier - maybe even possible in the first place - for me to enjoy the generally demonized 1967 album Their Satanic Majesties Request. First of all, I am not a huge fan of The Rolling Stones. I don't dislike them, and they have many really great tunes. I just don't get particularly excited about them, and can do with a mix CD or two of the songs I do like rather than their proper albums. (And I would probably prefer the second volume of Hot Rocks to the first one.) I don't dispute the claim that they are a great rock 'n roll band, simply that they are the world's greatest rock 'n roll band. Second, I do not worship at the altar of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. As I wrote in my Amazon review of the so-called greatest album ever, it is neither that nor the best album by The Beatles. Not by a long shot, in either case. Hence, I do not require the Stones to adhere to a strict code of bluesy raunch 'n roll. Most of their fans, of course, do, and who can blame them, as that is what made them great to begin with. Moreover, since I am not a fan of Sgt Pepper, the claims that TSMR is a lesser attempt to mimic SP doesn't really faze me. Generally, however, Stones fans are Stones fans, and Beatles fans are Beatles fans. Though often the twain shall meet, both groups expect very different things from each band. What would either group of fans care about a subpar version of a Beatles record?<br /><br />As I said, however, I am not a HUGE Stones fan. That may change, as I have only recently discovered that I had been inexplicably neglecting The Who for most of my life. I am a Beatles fan, but not an SP fanatic. Hence, I don't expect to TSMR to be like the Stones records that made me love them in the first place, nor to scale the heights supposedly reached by the record to which it is inevitably compared. I see it as just another psychedelic-flavored release of the late 60s, and judge it accordingly. And by this standard, it is a pretty good listen, and certainly an enjoyable one. Granted, it is different from the Stones records that came before and after it (its successor, Beggar's Banquet, seems like a knowing act of overcompensation). One can also argue that there is a generic sort of drop in songwriting quality on the record. Still, neither of these realities mean that the songs are any less enjoyable.<br /><br />TSMR starts off wonderfully with the jangley African rhythms of \\"Sing This All Together\\", and segues into the heavy riffs and irresistible well-timed \\"bings\\" of \\"Citadel\\". Then comes the echoey vocals of Bill Wyman's otherworldly \\"In Another Land\\", and the plaintive, well-strummed \\"2000 Man\\". Then the momentum slows a bit with the superfluously long \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\". I usually listen to this CD on a portable device, and thus give in to the ease of skipping over this song. However, I had it on in the background while I was doing other stuff recently, and found that it is a kinda cool jam with nicely nuanced references to the disc's opening track. Still, at eight-and-a-half minutes long, it takes up much more space than necessary. Fortunately, however, the boys get right back on track with \\"She's A Rainbow\\". The \\"she combs her hair\\" lyric is a bit of a forced rhyme, but the child-like piano, majestic strings, and Love-quoting \\"she comes in colors\\" lyric makes this a pretty well-realized bit of chamber pop by the pioneers of gritty R&B-based rock.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the rest of the CD shows a bit of a dip in overall quality. Only the largely instrumental exotica of \\"Gomper\\" is all that great among the last four tracks. \\"The Lantern\\" has some inspired riffing, and \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" is kinda interesting with its synthesizers, but lyrically it is somewhat juvenile.  Finally, the last track forces me to make an unfavorable comparison to Sgt Pepper. \\"On With the Show\\" is a bit too reminiscent Sgt Pepper telling the band to play, and the cheesy affected accent on the vocals certainly doesn't help. So while SP ends with the best song on the disc, TSMR ends with what is arguably the worst.<br /><br />It is ironic that \\"In Another Land\\", the third track on the disc, ends with snoring sound affects. After all, this is probably what many fans in November 1967 were doing at that point in the record. This is not a Stones record for Stones fans, although it reached as high (#2) on the US charts as their previous releases. It is the one that most of them wish could be erased from their catalog, even if it made them all the more grateful for Beggar's Banquet. I think that it is really unfair to simply dismiss TSMR as a dispensable one-off. It is all the more worth hearing for that very fact, and several of the songs are really quite good. It may not convince non-fans that the Stones were a Great band, and fans will never be convinced that this is a good record. But it finds the Stones inhabiting a different skin for  the only time in their career, and doing so quite well.<br /><br />Hear it for yourself, and be prepared to take sides.cheesy affected accent on the vocals certainly doesn't help.

B000002LCX|2.0|I think the only way you could really consider this a good album is if you are working BACKWARDS through their catalog. I remember as a teenager going to the record store and snatching up all the 12\\" singles they would release every other month it seemed back in 1984 and 1985. Each one was a gem, musical brilliance. Meat Is Murder is one of the finest pieces of British rock music produced, if not THE best in the 80's. Were it not for a few duds, I would say the same for The Queen is Dead. These are albums that to this day have not been matched in lyrical genius and musical expression. <br /> <br />Then you have this album. Now, I was quite a rabid fan back in the day - until I bought this album. I tried very very hard to like this album. But the dreadful, overproduced music coupled with Morrissey's obvious creative block made for some bad listening. I am thinking right now of the lyrics to \\"Stop Me..\\" and how bad they are. They actually make me cringe. Does repeating phrases 3 times in a row, 4 times in a song, compare to \\"Rusholme Ruffians\\"?  <br /> <br />Like I said, if you are working backwards throught their  catalog, you might think of this as a good album. But when I heard it, I knew it was over.  I think this could only appeal to fans of Morrisseys solo stuff, which I really really can't stomach.  <br />

0385512104|5.0|The novel is about a young boy Christopher, who is autistic. Christopher lives with his father who has told him his mother had passed away.  One night, as he took a walk in the neighborhood, Christopher discovered the neighbor's dog, Wellington, had been brutally murdered.  This incident made him curious and caused him to investigate. Later in the novel, he discover that his mother was still alive and his father had killed Wellington.  The story ends with Christopher living happily with his mother, but never finding the courage to forgive his father for the lies. <br />    I believe that this novel shows a lot about how being unfaithful and lying to your family and/or friends can cause relationships to be broken.  This was an excellent novel that kept me curious just like Christopher.  With every new chapter, I wondered who killed Wellington, and what would happen with Christopher's family. Before I read this novel I was pretty upset that I hadn't gotten to read the book I first choose.  After I read the novel however, I am glad that I read it and I recommend it for anyone who has trouble keeping focused on a book.
B00006AW2M|4.0|\\"Open our heads and the pictures come\\" indeed. Be forewarned: this album is a radical departure from the Stones' signature sound. It is clearly and obviously influenced by the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and other psychedelic music out at the time. After starting the album with the rollicking, jam-my \\"Sing This All Together\\", the killer riff of \\"Citadel\\" kicks in and totally rocks. With the exception of \\"On With The Show\\" I think everything else on this disc is fantastic (in all senses of the word). Even the somewhat rambling \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\" is pretty cool- it gives a good impression of being at a typical hippie gathering. Mick must have been psychic when he alluded to having an \\"affair with a random computer\\" in \\"2000 Man\\". Internet dating and chat rooms, anyone? This may not be an essential Stones album but it's a very,very good one. The only thing missing from the CD version is the wonderful 3D cover and gatefold sleeve of the original vinyl edition. Open your heads!
B00005JOVH|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I only know the mythos of the X-Men movies, and that I know barely nothing of the comic book series. Therefore, I am stating that I'm not a in-depth fan, just a superficial movie one. Having said that . . .<br /><br /> There was something missing from X-Men 3. Actually, there is more than one thing missing. The first thing that I noticed was the lack of emotional luggage that the first two entries had. This is what strung me along for those entries. The emotional relationship that the movie tied in with the action. We do get the emotional side of things in this film, but it seemed as if these scenes weren't treated with as much respect that the first 2 films did. And another thing that seemed to have not been treated with as much respect are the old school mutants. Summers, Rogue, and even Xavier were pushed aside so that the new mutants could get their screen time. Honestly, I didn't really wish to care about the new mutants. If this really is the Last Stand, I want all the stories I've seen before to be resolved before I move onto new ones.<br /><br /> And those are my only 3 complaints about X-Men 3. The action didn't surpass its predecessors, but it definitely was up there. The Golden Gate bridge scene? Freaking crazy. And Phoenix's first sign of insane crazy was great at Jean's house. Speaking of that character, Famke Jenssen was highly effective. And how hot was she?! Hugh Jackman carried his role well, as usual. I really want this Wolverine spin-off to happen. Halle Berry jumped in with her requested more screentime. Eh. I respect Ian McKellan to the fullest. Kelsey Grammar (gotta love him) as The Beast and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde were the two new mutants who I cared the most about.<br /><br /> X-men 3 is definitely not its predecessors. It definitely didn't go out with a bang. Maybe a snap ... or a pop. It could have been more. Much more. And they could have given it the extra 30 minutes to make it a two hour film like the first two. And perhaps that 30 minutes could have been given to the original mutants that deserved the time.<br /><br />... Am I a bit bitter about this? A little. But I still enjoyed the film. Especially what goes on after the credits have rolled.e the first two. And perhaps that 30 minutes could have been given to the original mutants that deserved the time.  <br /> <br />...

I don't agree with all of the concepts, but they provide a new (to me) view of the way which management approaches the planning and organization of a large company.   <br />Collins concepts are based on his observations of several large companies which had a market share which far outshone their competitors.  For each of these companies he speaks with the top level executives about their strategies and thoughts about the companies.  The one thing which struck a chord with me was Collins assertion that the companies with executives who were self effacing, `work horses' were more likely to achieve his level of `Great'.  This seemed to mesh with my personal experience, albeit at a much lower level within the companies. <br />

B0009SOFFY|5.0|My God. Is this the most raucous, out-of-control, reckless set of songs ever recorded? For their second album, the Stooges pulled out all of the stops, with the net result being a rock and roll album with near-seismic strength, supplanted by hooks that never die, even thirty years later. This is all the more incredible when you consider that just one year previous, the Stooges were barely able to play their instruments, and virtually incapable of writing original material. Most of the songs on their previous (debut) album were written almost overnight, because the record company felt (perhaps rightly) that four songs weren't enough to sustain a debut album. Despite their green-ness, they assembled a debut album that still stands as one of the most preposterous, unlikely classic debuts of all time. Afterward, most people presumed that they'd never be able to follow it up. Instead, they blew it away.<br /><br /> \\"Fun House\\" contains a never-ending set of mind-blowing rock and roll, played with a ferocity that most musicians can only dream of, or spend a lifetime cowering from. Many `studied' musicians thought the Stooges to be some kind of joke (that school of thought still exists in some quarters). The fact is, most musicians couldn't pull this off, even if they downed a quart of bourbon and gobbled a handful of Hercules pills. Even the late `70s punk bands couldn't reach this level of intensity. The 1-2-3 punch of  \\"Down in the Street\\", \\"Loose\\" and \\"TV Eye\\" was enough to redefine the parameters of rock and roll forever. Since then, there is no looking back, except to listen in awe to Iggy Pop and his cohorts as they maraud your stereo system. This re-release only deepens the intensity, since the album is re-mixed for full atomic effect, while the bonus disk provides alternate takes that rival the original album.<br /><br />Time would eventually prove that Iggy Pop and the Stooges were no fluke.

1400062071|5.0|Where does the loneliness we feel take us? How do we recover from terrible loss and redeem guilt? And how do we live the life we've been given? In this beautiful sophomore novel, Elizabeth Strout (AMY AND ISABELLE) carefully constructs ABIDE WITH ME, which explores faith, community, numbing loss, the tremendous power of words used carelessly, and redemption. <br /> <br />It's 1959, and the threat of nuclear destruction is uppermost in the minds of Americans. Against the gray cold backdrop of northern Maine, Reverend Tyler Caskey deals with his own devastation as he grieves the loss of his colorful and lively wife, Lauren. The once vibrant and articulate pastor is now reduced to reading old sermons to his Congregationalist church on Sunday mornings and is barely able to cope with each day. His family is splintered: his youngest daughter, Jeannie, has been parceled out to his unloving mother to raise, and Katherine has become alternately sullen and silent or screaming and acting out in kindergarten. <br /> <br />Caskey's housekeeper, Connie Hatch, tries to keeps order in the 100-year-old farmhouse in the small town of West Annett that serves as parsonage, but her own terrible secrets are a ticking time bomb. Tyler's congregation is becoming impatient with his grief; their gossip is about to involve him in events that will change his perceptions of his life and his abilities, while causing him to face a few secrets of his own. Dealing with problems is something he's not particularly good at. Lauren's final words ring in his ears: \\"Tyler, you're such a coward, you know.\\" <br /> <br />The colorless town, with its rather colorless meals, is nevertheless richly portrayed, from the gold gingko leaves in the autumn to such lovely phrases as \\"her earlier visit to his office hung over his shoulders like a cape dampened by rain.\\" Strout adeptly handles the flashbacks that slowly flesh out Tyler and Lauren's courtship and early marriage, and the terrible days leading up to her death. Some very specific sexual details, however, will limit conservative readers' enjoyment of the book. <br /> <br />One of Strout's strengths is her well-developed characters. Their interior lives are much more complex than the simplicity they present to the world, and their secrets darker than anyone would suspect. Strout makes them interesting yet believable. Connie is 46 years old, part Indian, with beautiful green eyes and a birthmark on the side of her nose, \\"red as raspberry jam.\\" She alternately repels the reader and attracts. Tyler's difficult mother, who criticizes and repeats the same stories over and over again, will be recognizable as a character type most of us have encountered, especially in the church. <br /> <br />Tyler is a curious mixture of strength and vulnerability. \\"It might have been this quality, as much as any other, that continued to make the minister so popular with his congregation: these moments of sudden bafflement, deep uncertainty. Surfacing from a man who appeared always in control of himself, who shouldered his misfortunes with the gentle air of an abstracted acceptance, these instances of open-faced bewilderment allowed people, particularly women but by no means only women, to view him as surprisingly and suddenly vulnerable...\\" Tyler lives in fear that he will lose his connection to God, \\"The Feeling,\\" those moments of transcendence that have been so important to him. It's our bond with Tyler and especially his relationship with his daughter, Katherine, that ensures we won't put the book down until the very last page. <br /> <br />Redemption and yearning are symbolized by the old hymn lyrics from Abide with Me, which appear throughout the book: \\"Abide with me; fast falls the eventide...The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.\\" Tyler comes to find that he isn't given an easy life, but it's a life in which God offers his presence. Readers who enjoyed Gail Godwin's EVENTIDE, Kent Haruf's PLAINSONG or Susan Howatch's Starbridge series should find this novel an absorbing pleasure <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby (phrelanzer@aol.com) <br />
B00007LTIL|5.0|If I were to discuss a list of albums that qualify as `life-altering', I'd have to say that few albums meet the grade as well as American Beauty. Not only does it represent the best studio effort of the Grateful Dead, it also represents the apotheosis of the hippie era, offering resolution in the face of disintegration and a path toward new possibilities. If the world had been paying close enough attention and heeded the message presented here, it might have become a better place for all of us. As history would have it, American Beauty is simply a masterwork, as complex and wondrous as the rose for which it is named, combining optimism and realistic expectation in a manner that embraces the complexity of life and translates it into a musical means of expression. So much of what I've just said sounds like a slew of words, but I really do believe that this album has had that profound of an effect on its generation.<br /><br />It should be noted that before this album was released, the Grateful Dead had amassed one true work of art (their previous studio album, Workingman's Dead), and it was all too easy to assume that it might have been a fluke of nature, a one-off that would never be equaled or surpassed. American Beauty rises to the challenge, and then raises the stakes. Workingman's Dead almost exclusively featured the songwriting of Jerry Garcia and lyricist Robert Hunter; American Beauty showcases the entire band, proving that Phil Lesh, Bob Weir and even Pigpen had developed the ability to write beyond expectations, and that they functioned together, as a team. It also offered diversity, sounding contemporary or old-fashioned, urban or rural, energetic or spent, optimistic or resigned, all in service to the song.<br /><br />Much of the gorgeous aural atmosphere of this record can be attributed to the pedal steel guitar of Jerry Garcia. Rarely has this instrument sounded as rich and full of emotional expression as it does here. Garcia's solo on \\"Candyman\\" is nothing less than wondrous, enough to freeze any non-believer in his tracks and draw him in. Equally magnificent is the imagery presented in the Phil Lesh/Robert Hunter-penned \\"Box of Rain,\\" which attempts to summarize the meaning of life by placing it in context of the time spent on this water-filled planet (Lesh's father had recently passed away), singing \\"It's just a box of rain, I don't know who put it there. Such a long, long time to be gone and a short time to be there.\\" Add in the optimistic imagery of \\"Sugar Magnolia,\\" and the unflinching backward glance at hippie-dom offered on \\"Truckin'\\" (a much more profound, relevant and sober observation than it is credited to be), and you have one remarkably insightful piece of art, one that simultaneously summarizes its past while bravely forging forward. Few artists have ever attempted to say as much, and fewer still have been even remotely successful. If ever anybody questions the relevancy of the Grateful Dead, in their own time or in the present, justification can be found almost anywhere on this album - provided, of course, that you are willing to listen to what you hear.

B00005JOVH|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, but I was disappointed. The acting and special effects were great, and the story had a lot of potential, but the movie just wasn't put together in a gripping, exciting way.<br /><br />The superhero characters I have enjoyed getting to know through X-Men 1 and 2 are still there, but instead of doing cool stuff, they just strut around, serving the script. I feel their passion, but not their motivation.<br /><br />At the end of a huge tragic scene, some of the characters start crying. When this happened, I felt suddenly catapulted out of the mood of the movie; I was just watching the actors cry, and I felt nothing, because the movie had done such a terrible job of telling the story during that scene.<br /><br />One of the things I like about X-Men 1 and 2 was that the movies and characters are so strongly grounded in reality. X-Men 3 is closer to its comic-book origins, and suffers because of it. The comic-book X-Men have fantastical histories; almost all of them have died and/or lost their mutant powers multiple times. For me, the strength of the first two movies is being able to identify with the characters, even while being awed by their powers. In this movie, reality is a distant memory, and the mutants' powers are little more than a special-effects freakshow.
B00005LMBK|3.0|Since we're in the business of reviewing music here and not marketing concepts, let's forget for a second that Gorillaz is a cartoon band. Imagine instead the real-life scenario of Damon Albarn (Blur), Miho Hatori (Cibo Matto, the Weymouth couple (Tina and Chris), and a bunch of others tooling around in a recording studio with no real sense of direction. Take away the imagery of four ultra-funky, international super hero freaks, and what you are left with is a random cauldron of sound with no focus. Gorillaz make music that is full of processed rhythms and melodies so monotonous that it's easy to forget that you're listening to music in the first place. Most of the international flavor comes from Jamaica, with dub techniques that pre-date rap styles, and the melodica, a mono-toned instrument that was abused by some reggae stylists. The balance of Gorillaz' influence is a predictable mix of hip-hop, rock and electronica. Some of their music is fun (\\"Clint Eastwood\\", for instance), but most of it is just plain stupid (\\"Man Research\\", \\"Punk\\", \\"Sound Check\\"...).<br /><br />As a `cartoon' record, I expected this CD to be much more upbeat and lively than it is. `Gorillaz' is just odd enough to hold my interest, but it's the type of collection that would embarrass me if I were caught listening by anyone with something that even resembles good taste. Other than the hit, the most interesting track is `5/4', which features a guitar part in 5 (actually 5/8, but who's counting?) fused over a standard 4/4 pattern. When the band does come up with a good riff, they beat it into your skull until you could scream from the repetition (\\"19-2000\\"). Easily the most bizarre track - among stiff competition - is \\"Que Pasa Contigo?\\", featuring Ibraham Ferrer of the Buena Vista Social Club, who sounds as though he's singing over the deranged samples with one eyebrow raised. `Gorillaz' might be an interesting novelty, but next time, it would be nice if they tried to make music, too.

The album combines elements of Yardbirds-style rave-ups (\\"Beat It On Down the Line,\\" the instrumental portion of \\"Viola Lee Blues\\"), blues (\\"Good Morning Little School Girl\\") and some extended jamming (\\"Viola Lee Blues\\"), but little that would suggest the elemental sound ahead of them. For those who love the Dead for what they would become, this album stands out as an aberration, sort of like a prototype version of what was to come. For those who dread the Dead, though, this album might provide an alternative means of understanding their methodology.<br /><br />The original songs (as opposed to the covers that constitute most of the album) \\"Cream Puff War\\" and \\"The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion)\\" sound more like the pop/psychedelia of their San Francisco-based competition Love or Jefferson Airplane than latter-day Dead. What's interesting here, though, is that although it is only their first album, they sound more focused and sure of themselves than either of these bands. Both of these songs would fit more comfortably on a `Nuggets'-style collection of sixties garage rock than they would on a Grateful Dead compilation CD, but they stand on their own merit. The blues tracks are straight ahead and hard hitting in a manner that the band would soon abandon. \\"New, New Minglewood Blues\\" and \\"Sitting On Top of the World\\" betray a raw energy level that is almost auspicious, especially in the context of the Grateful Dead catalog. It appears that this album catches the band at a crossroads where they are performing a high-wire balancing act, still attempting to please the crowd with uptempo arrangements, while simultaneously applying themselves to a more experimental means of expression. In a very short while, they would find themselves in the enviable position of pleasing the crowd because of that experimentation. Meanwhile, this album offers a unique glimpse of a time before such heady ambition would become a way of life.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|I had heard about this movie for years but was never able to find a copy in video stores, then when the 25th anniversary DVD was released I was all over it. The movie ranges from funny to motivational to inspirational. The training scenes are great, and contest footage is top notch. If it were made today it could be a reality t.v. show. In the bonus scenes director George Butler said they shot well over 100 hours of footage. The extra features were just about as good as the movie itself. One of the things that struck me most is that all these guys trained together, the comraderie was something that will probably never resurface like that again, imagine Cutler and Coleman training side by side! Arnold of course shined the brightest in this film and showed the charisma and physique that made him a legend and Hollywood icon. All in all, you can't go wrong with this film.
0767817664|4.0|I wasn't in the right mood when I saw this, so it took a long time for me to think 'urbane parody' instead of 'why is Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) such a screw-up.'  Most of this was due to a start that got most of its laughs from scenes of Charley ignoring his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) to spy on Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), the vampire who has moved in next door.  The sight gags simply don't work very well and until the film actually develops some dialog it doesn't really shift from 'yet another clich' ridden horror film with a big cast' to 'Hey! That was cool.'<br /><br />So Charley discovers that Dandridge is lunching on the local joy girls while Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) the ghoul redecorates the nest by painting the windows black.  Charley attempts to raise the alarm, but only manages to convince everyone that he is having a lot of 'teenage' moments.  In desperation, he turns to the local horror show host Roger Vincent (Roddy McDowell) and suddenly the film shifts into high gear.  He gives a one-man demonstration of the acting abilities that have put him in some 250 films, playing a crotchety ex-actor whose nickname was 'The Vampire Slayer,' now reduced to a late nite host with slipping ratings.<br /><br />McDowell plays the part as frightened man who knows that vampires really don't exist and then discovers that they do.  He squeezes every bit of humor there is to be had out of the part and somehow gets everyone else up to his level.  Just when you think the film is in danger of failing in spite of Sarandon's coolness, McDowell demonstrates that there is still a lot of life in those old clich's.  Fright Night can't help being light weight, but it does manage to be successfully entertaining.  And you get some interesting special effects when people go vampy face or dissolve upon staking.
0920668372|1.0|I suggest finding the review from the reader who experienced this book as a child in its original language.  I am relieved to hear that the author didn't write this book in a creepy manner, but rather, something went terribly awry in the translation to English.  My review, however, is on this English version of the book. <br /> <br />This book contains material screaming \\"Law and Order SVU here I come!\\"  The mother crawls across the floor and peeks up over the side of her son's bed.  Later she drives across town, crawls up a ladder into her adult son's bedroom window so she can rock him while singing the lullaby the book is named for.  Children who view this book see pictures depicting this behavior!  <br /> <br />No doubt the lyrics to the refrain about loving our children and liking them always touches a very REAL and sensitive cord with parents.  It explains the 4 stars this book has generated despite many 1 star reviews.  Come on parents, we know you love your children, but it isn't necessary to vote for an atrocious book just because it contains one TRUE refrain! <br /> <br />On that subject, the book is too repetitive.  My children are quite bored with it half way through!  Thank goodness!  I just skip all the words I don't like, change the story, skip whole picture pages and sing the refrain a couple of times. For my young son who gets a kick out of cute \\"no-no's\\", I point out the 2 year old who spills toothpaste on the floor, the nine year old who wears his muddy shoes in the house, and the teenager who is using the floor lamp as a microphone with pizza on the white carpet! It saves me from throwing the whole book out!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is awesome. The characters are so much fun to watch. There are so many great lines. This show should never have been cancelled. I'm on the bandwagon to bring it back.
0385484518|5.0|By now this book has been reviewed, dissected, and more or less everything said about it.  I have to say it though, this is about life's lessons. Lessons that are so poignantly put by someone living out his dying days.  Someone who decided not to go quietly into the night, and what a way to go.  I admire Morrie for what he did and for Mitch Albom in putting his words on paper.  I cannot imagine how dificult it must have been.  Yet the book is very uplifting, it gives me hope, it makes me feel that there is more to life than just waiting for the end.  All in all, a beautiful, well written and enlightening read.
B000002L9S|5.0|Madonna's True Blue is a nine-track masterpiece. I got this album because I love the track, Live to Tell. To my surprise I ended up loving all the tracks. La Isla Bonita, Where's the Party, and White Heat are standout tracks. Perfect and engaging disc. The first sign of maturity from Madonna was this album, she wrote every song, co-produced, and her voice sounds spectacular here. Excellent album to add to your Madonna collection.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is a lighthearted funny medical comedy-drama that gives more insight into the doctors' lives than similar shows like House or ER.  The main characters of the show are the five surgical interns assigned to Dr. Bailey, a resident at Seattle Grace Hospital.  These aren't just any interns, they're surgical interns, the most cutthroat group of them all.  Under the tutelage of Dr. Derek Shepherd, a neurosurgeon, Dr. Preston Burke, a cardiothoracic surgeon, and \\"The Chief\\"  Richard Webber, the interns learn and grow.  The show focuses not only on their cases and individual lives, but on the interaction the interns have with each other, their coworkers, and their patients.<br /><br />The interns are:<br /><br />Meredith Grey--daughter of living legend and super-surgeon, Ellis Grey. Dartmouth Graduate, though doesn't make it plain that she knows more than everyone else--at least not all the time.  Owns the house that three of the interns decide to share.  An overall nice girl.  It's a shame for poor Meredith that on her first day as a surgical intern she discovers she's slept with one of her bosses, Dr. Derek Shepherd (otherwise known as Dr. McDreamy).<br /><br />Christina Yang--Brown undergraduate, Stanford Medical School, and overall overachiever.  Christina Yang is smarter than you, and she's going to make it plain.  Christina is the type of girl who if you were racing to the corner and you tripped and fell, she'd finish the race first then come back and see if you were okay.  It works for her though and it's hard to dislike her for it.<br /><br />Alex Karev--someone has to play the bad guy, and on this show it's Karev.  He's the doctor who will tell you that you've got cancer and then tell you to suck it up when you shed a tear.  The good thing about Karev though is that his brutal honesty isn't covering up for anything.  Occasionally you find yourself wondering if someone can really be so callous.  Yes, they can.<br /><br />Izzy Stevens--Izzy is the pretty girl who people will always look at twice upon finding out that she's really a doctor.  She paid her way through medical school by posing as a centerfold in a men's magazine and the male doctors don't want to let her be more than a pretty face.  Izzy is the doctor you'd want to have if you were looking for compassion, and a kind word rather than the cold hard truth of the matter.<br /><br />George O'Malley--rounds out the merry group by being the peacemaker and the one who keeps everything balanced.  It's blatantly obvious that he has a huge crush on Meredith, but he thinks no one has a clue.  For some reason, Dr. Burke has picked George as his favorite.<br /><br />This group of interns offer humor, warmth, and usually some interesting turn every week.  This show is the reason I watch television on Sunday, and for a little hidden insight check out greyswriters.com, where you can see what the writers were thinking when they came up with different story lines. This show is definitely worth taking a look at, even though the first season only has 2 discs with 9 episodes total.twice upon finding out that she's really a doctor.

B0002OERI0|1.0|Why no edited version of Greenday? Yes Billy Joe, some people find cursing very offensive. Even though the music's great, they're losing a lot of money by not making an edited version, just about everyone I know would like one. And what's with the picture on front of the CD? It doesn't have anything to do with ANY of the songs!
B00005JOTV|5.0|Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan) is a good luck charm who takes her luck for granted.  When she whistles for a cab, 3 of them stop in front of her.  She wins those Scratch and Win lottery tickets all the time.  She finds money on the street.  Jake Hardin (Chris Pine) couldn't be more opposite.  When a car whizzes by him, he's the one left in the mud.  He gets jumped by cops for no reason at all.  He's an accident waiting to happen.  One day at a costume party, Ashley and Jake meet by chance, and when dancing they kiss.  Miraculously their luck switches.  Suddenly, Ashley breaks a heel and Jake finds himself in a luxurious suite.  Now Ashley sees what it's like to live a not-so-glamorous life.  It is up to her to kiss Jake to switch back the spell.  But does she wanna do that?  After all, Jake needs the luck more than she does.  <br /> <br />\\"Just My Luck\\" is a hilarious comedy that will have you laughing at some parts.  I recommend this movie to anyone that watched, and liked, Freaky Friday. <br />
B000000WGL|4.0|I liked it much better when I gave it a listen 18 years after it was released. It is much better than any of the drivel that the Stones have released over the last 20 years, and certainly lends to the theory that Keith is and was the real composer of the two. <br /> <br />Steve Jordan shines on drums. He out \\"Charlies\\" Charley!
0316172324|5.0|If you're line of work involves evaluating people in any way shape or form, this is a must read. You won't view your job or how you assess what people bring to the table the same way ever again. <br />The book is a highly entertaining read.  The central theme revolves around \\"thin slicing\\" or how people intuit what they're hearing or seeing.  We all recognize that in most every decision making process we undertake, there is a \\"gut feel\\" that we have about which direction we should take.  Why?  Where does it come from and do we act upon it or not?  Or, do we consciously reason our way to an alternative solution and if so-does that decision wind up being a good one? <br />The author uses a variety of examples to demonstrate why this process of \\"thin slicing\\" is so powerful.  There are a number of intriguing studies woven throughout the book that will have you hungry to learn more.  The implicit versus explicit views that we all possess, many of them conflicting, are discussed and analyzed via a number of intriguing case studies. <br />Yes the concepts introduced in Blink tend not to \\"fit\\" perfectly.  The book doesn't satisfy some peoples need to have everything neatly summarized and laid out.  But the book is extremely enlightening, thought provoking and leaves you hungry to learn more about the thought processes we all employ to make \\"people\\" decisions in life.  I highly recommend it.  You won't be the same after reading it.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I didn't know anything about MTV series.  Regardless, I enjoyed the movie and it does have good entertainment value.  It's about what a would-be perfect world could entail and how science and medicine could make it but with certain lasting effects.  What happens when you combine Rebels with government and they have a past that they can't/don't remember and what can happen when they do.  No this movie doesn't give itself away in the begining which means you have to follow the story and have some sort of an attention span. <br />By the way, this is a FANTASY/SCI FI style movie.  SO, if you don't enjoy that style of book or movie than don't get this and if you did buy it (and don't like fantasy/sci-fi style, than don't waste our time with bad comments, just take it at face value.)
B00008BXJG|5.0|Revievs as such : \\"AC/DC are one of the most overrated bands out of the 70's.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|A phenonmenal movie through and through! It is sad that so many people are still holding prejudice about homosexual people. The world we live today function on acceptance, and it is through accepting others for who they are that we have the great nation we live in today. Perhaps it is time for people who say that this movie is spreading homosexual propaganda that if people do become gay from watching this movie, then perhaps these people are already gay to begin with. True love has no limit, and if people can just put their prejudice aside, they will see this movie as the great movie it truly is.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Due to the breathtaking cinematography, heart-wrenchingly exquisite script, and flawless acting of Brokeback Mountain, this film has inevitably joined the ranks of my top ten movies. Brokeback Mountain is a tragic love story which, in my opinion, rivals such classics as Romeo and Juliet. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal portrayed the incredible connection between two lovers better than most actor/actress pairings I've seen. The intense emotion evoked from this movie continued to engulf me days after seeing it...I only hope that Brokeback continues to move viewers in the way that is has moved me.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It takes your breath away. The film is so powerful and so beautiful. After reading all the reviews I should say I'm surprised the gay population is so narrow-minded to see it as a gay movie. It is a devastating love story between two human beings. I think everybody should see it just to see how somebody can love, because that's why we all live, not everybody is that lucky though to find it.  <br /> <br />This is a DVD that everyone need to buy, and add it to their video collection for generations to come.   <br /> <br />The acting is superb! Good job everybody...
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I was so excited to hear about this release then it turned out that the original Star Wars movies, offered as bonus material, are nothing more than non-anamorphic 1993 laser disc reproduction after thoughts on DVD.    This release is not for the fans; George Lucas long ago forgot about them, this release is all about combating the bootleg DVD market (where the original Star Wars trilogy has been a mainstay for years).  The tragedy is this release is no better than the bootlegs it's trying to combat!  It's essentially, an \\"official\\" original Star Wars bootleg DVD.    Very sad to continue seeing George Lucas and Lucasfilm treat this trilogy with such disrespect.    The Special Edition DVDs are included here as well (and yes, they are still the \\"Special Editions\\" that have been hacked up with slapstick CGI and storytelling gaffs, even if they don't say \\"Special Edition\\" any longer).
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Except for the ommision of the death of Jack's father-in-law and the added importance of Enis's daughter, the screenplay faithfully follows the story's plot and characters.  <br /> <br />The film brings to the story vivid images of the magnificent landscape of Brokeback Mountain and the development of the characters present them as I envisioned them reading the short story.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I just bought this DVD and am enjoying it for the umpteenth time, because I showed it to my teenage daughters and now their friends all are starting to get into it. It's playing on ABC family now but I cannot stand the dubbed version; losing the profanity messes up some of the best lines. I graduated HS in 1980 and was the \\"princess\\" dating the Judd Nelson character so I totally relate!
0060543884|5.0|This book is THE book.  I will read this book again just before I die.   <br /> <br />A tale of the true hero in an average boy who follows his heart to his destiny.  I recommend this book to any teenager who is about to embark on his/her search for their own path in life.  I have yet to find another book that can replace this one in any way.  The only fault in this tale is that you wish it was longer.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is an incredible movie. If me and my friends aren't quoting it back and forth to each other were watching it. I would suggest this movie to western movie lovers or to those who arent the western enthuisits. Great acting and wonderful movie plot. You will fall in love with this movie after the first time watching it and want to start it over and watch it again.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Anthony and the gang have opened up a huge can of wiggly worms using Frusciante's new-found creativity on guitar.  His riffs form the creative foundation of this amazing amalgam of alternately muscular and subtle songs.  The Chilis have never sounded better - amazing hooks and surprisingly strong vocals (often accompanied by harmony).  The lyrics are a bit of a let-down after the brilliance of \\"By the Way\\" but the shear virtuosity of Frusciante's guitar work  more than compensates.  This is a GREAT rock/pop record - the absolute best so far this year and perhaps destined to be a classic.<br /><br />I can't WAIT to see these guys on tour.
B000BVD460|5.0|I love this CD.  Eminem picked some great songs to put on this greatest hits album.  Even the three new songs seem to fit perfectly in the play list, and even hold there own with some of E's best stuff.  I personally like it when Eminem raps about stuff that is personal to him and this album seems to be a collection of all of those songs.  I can relate to the song \\"Cleaning out my closet\\" and I understand E's frustration.  \\"Lose Yourself\\" is an instant classic that will motivate people for years to come.  The songs \\"When I'm gone\\" and \\"Mockingbird\\" are heartfelt songs about E's father-daughter relationship with Hailie Jade.  \\"Stan\\" (Live) performed by Eminem and Elton John live at the 2001 Grammy Awards presentation is the gem stone in this collection.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|In this movie, both main actors portray characters which come across as completely believable. Willingly or not, you are drawn to the difficulties they encounter and find yourself immerse and fully identified with both characters and the dilema that rules their entire lives.  <br /> <br />A must see movie this year!!! Definitely an all-time classic. Buy this film now! You will be happy that you did.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I was skeptical that Charlize Theron could pull of a believable tough girl.  It really worked in this movie.  The story concept was fantastic.  The only problem I had was that the story was to big for the movie.  It could easily have been divided into two movies or more.  If you can call that a criticism.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in Sci-fi movies.
0440178002|5.0|If you're reading this you're probably wondering if you want to read James Clavell at all because the novels are so big, and you have to invest time.  If this is you, my suggestion is begin with SHOGUN the made-for-TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlain.  It's largely faithful to the book - in tone as well as story - and if you like it, try the books.<br /><br />SHOGUN is big, but a fast read, exciting, rich with the history of feudal Japan, and packed with adventure and intrigue.<br /><br />If you like SHOGUN, I think you'll enjoy TAI-PAN and GAI-JIN.  Read them in that order because many Tai-Pan characters appear directly or are referred to in GAI-JIN.  Tai-Pan tells the story of the Struen trading dynasty and founding of Hong Kong.  The action and intrigue give a really interesting perspective on the clash between early Asian and British cultures.<br /><br />GAI-JIN jumps forward in time, and from China back to Japan, as Dirk Struen's grandson Malcolm struggles to keep his family dynasty strong in the middle of great personal and political crisis and intrigue.  It's also exciting, and paints a great historical portrait of English/American-Japanese dynamics the way Tai-Pan does for English-Chinese culture clashes.<br /><br />AUDIO VERSIONS - Tai-Pan and Gai-Jin are both available unabridged on audio, narrated by the British-accented John Lee.  Lee does an excellent job with both.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a beautifully realized animated (anime) film on spiritual decay and renewal set in modern-day Japan. The subtexts are rather bluntly stated: the uber-bourgeois Dad and Mom (driving an Audi, we note, a very expensive proposition in Japan) stumble upon a feast prepared for the spirits. Gorging themselves on the feast, they are transformed into huge pigs for their trespass. (Humans, by the way, smell bad to the spirits; the spiritual rot of humanity fills the very air.)<br /><br />Their young daughter, Chihiro, refuses to eat, and is thus spared. She is the pure-hearted heroine of the movie, the one who refuses the blandishments of greed and excess. When a spirit causes a free-for-all in the spirits' huge bath house (furo) by scattering gold from his fingertips, only Chihiro has no interest in scrambling for the material wealth. When the gold is revealed later to be nothing but dirt, her wisdom and purity of spirit stands in stark contrast to the wild greed of everyone else.<br /><br />When a truly repulsive spirit enters the bath house, it falls to Chihiro to lead the stinking mass of oozing filth to a large tub. She discovers a sword embedded deep in the repulsive spirit's body, and with the combined efforts of the entire bath house workforce, she succeeds in removing the weapon. But the sword is not a single blade; out of the wound pours rusty bicycles and a mountain of industrial and consumer crud. This avalanche of waste spews out, filling the entire cavernous room; for the spirit is a river spirit, and this mountain of metal [...] is everything that has been thrown into the river by humans.<br /><br />This is a story of a whiny, self-centered girl who grows through confronting enormous challenges into a powerful force for love and renewal. But more pointedly, it is also a story of the spiritual corruption of modern Japan: greedy and wasteful beyond measure, gorging on consumerist trash which is thoughtlessly dumped into the landscape.<br /><br />That is to say, the film could have easily been made by a sharp-penned filmmaker in the U.S. about the very same spiritual rot and consumerist greed which similarly afflicts our culture. If you haven't seen this remarkable and interesting film, do so; you will not be disappointed in its visual and thematic wealth.ld have easily been made by a sharp-penned filmmaker in the U.S. about the very same spiritual rot and consumerist greed which similarly afflicts our culture.

0385512104|4.0|The curious incident of the dog in the nighttime is a very interesting book. Not only does it tell a story of a young boy who is dealing with his life as an autistic young man, but it explains many unusual facts that the average person may not know. This book is dramatic and is hard to put down once you start. This book shows the chances that Christopher Boone takes to find out lies that have been surrounding him for most of his life, some being more shocking than anything he can imagine. The curious incident of the dog in the nighttime takes you into Christopher's mind and shows you what he thinks on a normal day basis. It shows you his good days and bad days and about why he hates the color yellow. The book moralizes that anything is possible, even if it has to do with a dog, a subway, or a trip to london. I would recomend this book to anyone. It's very good.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I won't lie to ya'll.  I started watching this show because I thought the brothers were hot as hell!  Now I am obsessed with the show because it's so damn good!  I get so into it, I laugh, I cry, and I screamed once.  It is addicting.  From the family problems to the supernatural things in it.  The cast and the places it goes.  The show goes all the way and the cast shows everything.  It's AMAZING!  Jensen Ackles is not only the hot older brother, but he's the smart-ass screw the world guy and yet when something happens to his family he is a caring kick your ass if you hurt my family guy.  Jared Padelecki is the younger brother who is also hot but he is a caring guy with some serious issues he can't help.  He never new his mom and his girlfriend who he was going to marry was killed the same way his mother was killed.  Add in the dad and you have a breakout star cast.  It is the best show on TV and I can't wait for next season.  All though it has switched from The WB to The CW because of a merger I will be there front and center when it starts up again.!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of the best movie experiences I've ever had.  Innovative, fascinating, and unusual, this movie breaks boundaries and twists your mind in interesting ways.  I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and I still find something new every time I watch it.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|If the films were cleaned up ie The Special Editions, and restored to today's technological standards then yes, I'd absolutely have to run out and buy the set.  But I'm not about to invest in an outdated version/1993 laserdisc transfer of one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time.  There are simply too many Star Wars fans who prefer the theatrical films to the updated ones and releasing a quality DVD of the Original Trilogy shouldn't prove to be this much of a problem.
0451191153|5.0|In a macroscopic sense, The Fountainhead is about the struggle of the exceptional mind (innovators and geniuses) versus the mediocre mind (intellectual leeches and society-at-large).  In a microscopic sense, this novel is about the relationship of Howard Roark (the exceptional) with his contemporary, Peter Keating (the mediocre), and his nemesis, Ellsworth M. Toohey and the rest of society (the unthinking herd).    The Exceptional:  Howard Roark is an architect who has not only pushed the envelope, but has broken the mold.  Reviled and undermined by his architectural peers, Roark, despite being the most brilliant, innovative, and cost effective architect of the time, is left to scrounge for any work he can get.  Since his work IS his happiness and highest ideal, this doesn't bother him, because he knows the day will come when superlative achievement and action, not masks of prestige and back-room deals, rule the day.     The Mediocre:  Peter Keating is loved by all and is called the greatest architect of his time.  Yet he has attained his celebrity and prestige not by standing on the shoulders of giants, but by stealing the shoulders himself.  Peter is a shell of a man and has no talent.  He is actually reliant on Roark for his architectural renderings.  Peter is a product of what OTHER people want, and his life and subsequent downfall represents the travesty of complete sacrifice of self.    The Rat:  Actively working against what Roark stands for is Ellsworth M. Toohey.  Toohey is a \\"meek\\" man, but he doesn't want to inherit the earth, he wants to drain it of the superlative, and replace the void with the ordinary, the mundane, and the mediocre.  Why?  Because these are the easiest people to control.  Toohey endorses the \\"average\\" and promulgates self-sacrifice for the betterment of others.  These are his tools he uses to gain immense social power; Toohey is an up-and-coming dictator.    Roark represents the highest virtue of man: unadulterated, egotistical achievement.  It is through the self-centered, egotistical achievements of men and women, like him, that society prospers through laissez faire economics, though \\"altruistic\\" power mongers (Ellsworth M. Toohey) want to usurp those thinking, reasoning minds in order to corral society into the grips of a collectivist dictatorship, all in the name of the \\"social good.\\"      This book is easier to digest in that the storyline utilizes more plausible occurrences as opposed to Atlas Shrugged; the Fountainhead is easier to believe.  The Fountainhead is also more of a scary parallel of what is beginning to emerge in the United States as well.    The overall \\"take-home\\" message of the novel is simple: the combination of multiple individuals acting in their own self-interest (NOT self-sacrifice) add up to create the social good (good ole' Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations)
B000002OVJ|5.0|One thing I admit being guilty of is not paying much attention to the Who during my formative years of rock listening. The last few years have seem me realize that it was a big mistake. Who's Next is one of the best albums of all time and Live at Leeds might be the best live album ever. The talent of bassist John Entwhistle is beyond compare and the res of the band is spot on. A high energy performance with some extended jamming.  When you want to rock out with a live album this one just might be the king. Fantastic sound quality as well which is very important to me.  A must.
0141301139|5.0|I definitely recommend that you get this book for your children, nieces, nephews, and any other kids who play an active role in your life. I loved this book when I was gorwing up! When my older brother turned [...], he decided that he was mature enough to read \\"real books\\" as he called them and so he gave me, his then [...] kid sister, his entier collection of Roald Dahl books and other great children stories. I stayed up all night and read as much as I could. Of course I probably spent more time looking at the pictures, as I was just learning English. Growing up in France, I really only gained a proficient english level around the age of 7 or 8. However, I know that it is thanks to Dahl that I am now writing this review, hopefully withough too many mistakes. Mr Fox is also the reason why I enjoy reading so much. At the age of 12 I had read most of Oscar WIlde's work,albeit without understanding the clever subtext. But back to Dahl's favourit Fox. Well the title really tells it all, he's a fantastic fox. And what kid does not enjoy a good story about a witty animal who manages to overcome idiotic traps set by the overwight farmers? None. So if you want your child to learn english while having fun, or simply learn to enjoy reading, then drop off \\"Mr Fox\\" by their bedroom door.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I hate hearing that question, don't you?  It's like hearing Lebron James is the next Michael Jordan.  But Coldplay is Coldplay, and that's good enough for me.  This album shows maturity for a group where expectations were extremely high.  And where it might be lacking some of the sing-a-long songs of Rush Of Blood To The Head, this is an excellent album.  Chris owns the piano and his falsetto has never sounded better (and what's also great about Coldplay is that they sound just as good live, which is huge since many bands in this technological age do not).  Songs like Fix You, What If?, and Talk show us that Coldplay will be around for a long, long time.  And yes, during that time, we will hear things like \\"the next U2!\\" or \\"reminds me a little of Radiohead.\\"  But time will tell that we will start comparing every upcoming band to Coldplay, as they will probably topple all other competition.  Can't wait for the next Coldplay CD!
B0002ZYE1Y|1.0|This album is rather crappy. My main problem with the album is the severe shortage of guitar solos. Secondly, Tuomas's writing has apparently gone to crap (Wish I Had An Angel is the WORST song I've ever heard). Thirdly, Marco's vocals suck and have gotten worse since Century Child. Other than having an annoying voice, he can't seem to sing in key. I didn't think anything could suck as much as his vocals on Phantom Of The Opera from Century Child, but his vocals on Wish I Had An Angel manage to take the cake. The bottom line is that Wishmaster was a masterpiece, and this band has gone downhill ever since that album. Century Child was still ok, but Once is utter crap.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab For Cutie is the best at what they do: write emotional songs that build beautifully with excellent heartfelt lyrics and perfect vocals.  And for anybody that cries sellout because they went major label need to get off of their high horse.  The fact that Death Cab waited so long to go major label and that this album does not change their style at all means that people need to rethink their definition of what \\"sellout\\" means.  Death Cab has once again released a perfect CD where all the songs have depth and meaning and are catchy.  Highlights include: Marching Bands of Manhattan, Soul Meets Body, I Will Follow You Into The Dark, and What Sarah Said.  Personally, Gibbarb could sing just about anything and I would enjoy it but the fact that he writes such earnest, relatable lyrics makes them that much better.  Death Cab is here to stay, so get used to it.  And with a major label backing, they will start getting the credit that they deserve.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore has been called a traitor by conservatives for making this film, for them, anyone who questions Bush or his actions should be condemned or even jailed, as one reviewer suggested on this board.  Is it not an American's duty to hold their elected officials accountable for their actions?  If a president deceives the nation on such a grand scale as Bush has, is it not reasonable to call his fitness to serve into question?  Moore has been accused of hating America for recognizing the wrongs of our nation in films like Fahrenheit and his previous works.  By this logic, a parent who questions their child's wrong behavior and tries to convince them to correct it must be full of hatred towards their child.  Moore makes the films he does out of love for a nation that he hates to see being mislead, the young men and women unnecessarily being sent to die or be wounded, and the millions of hard workers in this nation being left behind while rich corporations make off like bandits.    People have attacked the credibility of the film, yet give few, if any, specific examples of inaccuracies.  Every line of the film is backed up with sources that Moore has made available on his website and the companion book.   Even so, can anyone dispute the words coming out of Bush's mouth?  Did Moore hire the Tonight Show Bush look-alike to make Bush appear to say some of those ridiculous things?  Did he hire a talented makeup crew to make those Iraqi children look like their faces were scorched and limbs blown apart?   Did he hire a talented actress to give a convincing performance of a mother whose son was sent to his death in service to his country?  No, these are all real and unavoidable.        This movie is a splash of cold water into the face of all Americans to wake up and realize the despicable campaign of fear and deception waged on this nation by the powers that be, to profit off the suffering and death of innocents and the sacrifice of our servicemen/women.  If America would care more about who occupies the Oval Office than who is the next American Idol, we wouldn't be stuck with this incompetent fool of a president, surrounded by his father's cronies calling the shots.  It's time for America to stand up and take our country back.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent!  I love this raw sound of the White Stripes that doesn't sacrifice the melody.  Jack shows he is one of the best rockers out there (and Meg, well, you gotta love Meg!).  Standout tracks are Seven Nation Army (which sounds like Salvation Army), Ball and Biscuit (I love to crank up the solos!), I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself, You've Got Her In Your Pocket, and even In The Cold, Cold Heart (You go Meg!).  Yes, the drums are choppy in places, but it works well with the White Stripes and you gotta admit - there is no one else like them.  They are original and are here to stay!
0743424425|5.0|This book is a work of a pure genius.It does not only concentrate on the horror aspects of the story but on the emotional level as well.As much as people would like to  believe that this book is totally scary,think again.Yes,it is scary in a way,it has a lot of ghosts etc.But deep down inside,hidden inside this book if you read it carefully,you would feel the power of the words.Stephen King actually takes the family in the book and makes them yours...Yes,he is that good.I wounder how he does it?But anyway I definitely recommend this book...It simply begins when an unemployed man takes a job at a hotel,a haunted one I might add,and takes his family with him...Then the story begins,and once you begin there is no stopping.........enjoy...Nigel.<br /><br />Here is another piece of writing(not mine),taken from my research:Jack Torrance is a temperamental writer who is trying to rebuild his and his family's life after his alcoholism and volatile temper cause him to lose his teaching position at a small preparatory school. Having given up alcohol, he accepts a job as a winter caretaker at a large, isolated hotel in Colorado, hoping that this will reestablish him as a responsible person, enable him to finish a promising play, and resume his career. He moves into the Overlook Hotel with his wife, Wendy, and young son, Danny, who is telepathic (the \\"shining\\" of the title) and sensitive to supernatural forces. The hotel is possessed by a life force or is itself sentient and especially uses people with psychic powers. Danny, who has had premonitions of the hotel's danger to his family, begins seeing ghosts and frightening visions from the hotel's past, but tolerates them in the hope that they are not dangerous in the present. He doesn't tell his parents because he senses how important the job of caretaker is to his father's and his family's future. Having difficulty possessing Danny, the hotel begins to possess Jack, frustrating his need and desire to work as he becomes increasingly unstable, and gradually turns him to its purposes. Jack is turned insane and tries to murder his family but they are saved at the last minute by Danny's chef friend Dick Hallorann who is also a shiner. Jack is killed when the boiler explodes, different to the film version where Jack murders Halloran with his axe and then freezes to death in the snow. Wendy and Danny survive in both versions and Hallorann survives in the book...<br /><br />enjoy...Nigel.stable, and gradually turns him to its purposes.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|For those who did not like this album the first time around, give it another try.  This is one of those concept albums that actually work (unlike Green Day).  Win takes us on a ride through cold weather and death and heartache...and we're there every step of the way.  Highlights include Tunnels, 7 Kettles, Crown Of Love, Wake Up, and Rebellion (Lies).  But hey, that's half the CD so you might as well listen to it all.  These songs build and build to perfection and Arcade Fire features young people that are really good at their instruments (look at the inside of the CD to see how many they play).  I can see why some do not like the Arcade Fire, as we all have our different styles, but if you're a fan of Iron and Wine, Sufjan, and Bright Eyes without the uninsightful liberal political leanings, then the Arcade Fire is for you.
0671042858|5.0|This book is not at all scary but the technique SK uses is brilliant.The books takes you through the forest and back,leaving you petrified...I would recommend it,definitely...<br /><br />Here is the plot:(based on my reading of the book and also my research)...The story is set in motion by a family hiking trip, during which Trisha's brother and mother constantly squabble about the mother's divorce, as well as other topics. Trisha falls back to avoid listening and is therefore unable to find her family again after she wanders off the trail to take a bathroom break.<br /><br />She starts walking in the direction she thinks they went, but takes a wrong turn and ends up hopelessly lost, heading deeper into the heart of the forest. She is left with a bottle of water, four Twinkies, a boiled egg, a sandwich, a large bottle of Surge, a poncho, and her Walkman to survive. Now and then she listens to her Walkman to keep her mood up, either to learn of news of the search for her, or to listen to baseball games featuring her favorite player, and \\"hearthrob,\\" Tom Gordon.<br /><br />As she starts to take steps to survive by conserving what little food she has with her, and consuming edible flora such as birch nuts, checker berries, and fiddleheads; her mother and brother return to their car without her and call the police and start a search. Naturally, the rescuers search in the area around the path, but not as far away as she has gone. The girl decides to follow a creek, rationalizing that all bodies of water lead to a source and eventually civilization.<br /><br />As the cops stop searching for the night, she huddles up underneath a tree to rest. Eventually, a combination of fear, hunger, and thirst causes Trisha to hallucinate. She imagines several people from her life, as well as her hero, Tom Gordon, appearing to her. Author Stephen King purposely makes it unclear whether increasingly obvious signs of a monster in the woods are also hallucinations. (Noting she is in the same area of woods as Louis Creed in Pet Sematary, some even suggest that what Trisha observes are signs of the Wendigo, the bloodthirsty monster that haunts the woods of upper Maine, and the same thing the good doctor saw when he went to bury his son in the Micmac Burial ground.)<br /><br />Hours and soon days begin to pass, with Trisha wandering further into the woods. Eventually she begins to believe that she is headed for a confrontation with the God of the Lost, a wasp-faced, evil entity who is hunting her down. Her trial becomes a test of a very young girl's ability to maintain sanity in the face of seemingly certain death. Eventually she comes upon a road, but just as she discovers signs of civilization, she is confronted by a bear -- which she (possibly correctly) interprets as the God of the Lost in disguise. She attempts to fend the bear off by pitching her Walkman at it, but is rescued by a hunter.<br />...enjoy...Nigel.n Pet Sematary, some even suggest that what Trisha observes are signs of the Wendigo, the bloodthirsty monster that haunts the woods of upper Maine, and the same thing the good doctor saw when he went to bury his son in the Micmac Burial ground.)

B000F3TBIO|5.0|This album is unlike anything else that you will hear.  Some may call this pop, however I am mystified by that misnomer.  If pop is simply determined by beat than I guess this album might be 'popish'.  If you appreciate different music that is genuinely creative and you like electronic beats I believe that you will like this album.  If you are a long time Patton fan and are wishing for Faith No More or Bungle than this will not fit that bill.  However, if you are a long time Patton fan my guess is that you will not be expecting this to be a rehash of his other projects.<br /><br />This album should be one of the best of the year (for those who appreciate artists who could care less about pop culture or political correctness).
0553382179|5.0|I first heard about FlyLady.com from my cousin.  After seeing a few mentions on message boards, I eventually wandered over to her website to see what the fuss was all about.  There's a ton to read on the site, which can be a tad overwhelming, so I just started investigating her Beginner BabySteps page.  And I gotta say...after reading and implementing Days 1-10, I noticed my mornings were consistently starting off on the right foot.  FlyLady now had my full attention. <br /> <br />I didn't bother signing up for the daily emails since I really hate that kind of thing.  And because I was just starting this whole FlyLady cleaning/organizing stuff, I figured constant suggestions via email might start ticking me off, which would increase the risk of my quitting.  I really wanted to give this a fair shake, so I went searching for and found this book.  Granted, as others have pointed out, a person could get all the information on the FlyLady website for free.  But I prefer sitting down with a book, giving it my full attention.  Plus I wanted something I could refer to whenever I liked without hesitation and without getting sidetracked by anything else I like to do on my computer.   <br /> <br />Basically, Marla lays out a really great program to help you clean and keep your house (and yourself) in darn good shape.  Some of the suggestions seem so simplistic (like making sure the kitchen sink is empty and clean before you go to bed, or laying out your clothes for the next day), but they really do make a huge difference.  I personally wasn't aware of how crappy I felt coming down in the morning to dishes in the sink until I started cleaning it up the night before.  The difference in my attitude from just that act alone is what pushed me to continue reading the FlyLady suggestions. <br /> <br />In addition to adopting short, daily routines used to keep the house in shape (and yourself feeling pretty good about things), she offers more involved tasks called Zone cleaning.  I haven't fully ventured into that territory yet, but I plan to once I get the daily routine to where I like it.  I can see already how helpful that will be, and I actually look forward to tackling different parts of my house, which is kinda weird when you think about it.  Looking forward to really cleaning the living room?!  I know it sounds bizarre, but after you start getting into the book, it all seems more than possible. <br /> <br />Her attack on Clutter is wonderful!  You won't believe how much easier it is to clean and organize once clutter starts disappearing.  It's a process that takes time, so it won't get done in a day, but DARN it feels so good to take 1 full garbage bag to the corner for pick up and 1 full garbage bag to Salvation Army!  That's 2 bags less of stuff for you to dust/push around/pick up/feel guilty over.  :oD  Again, it's so simple yet so effective. <br /> <br />She suggests a Control Journal, which I find to be a little too compulsive, but that's just me.  If it works for you, then go for it.  From that suggestion, I just put together a well-rounded emergency phone list, and this alone made me happy.  I think this \\"take what you need, leave the rest behind\\" approach is a good one for anything in life, and it works well with FlyLady's technique.  Don't get hung up on doing things exactly as she says, as this may frustrate you just as much as a messy house will.  Be willing to make small adjustments that fit your schedule and personality.  Example:  If you don't want to create a Daily Checklist, then don't.  You can still create a morning routine for yourself, but not everyone needs it written down to be checked off later.  I don't do many of the specifics in the book, yet I've had great success so far. <br /> <br />There are chapters dedicated to Laundry, Menu Planning, Paper Clutter (ack!), Vacations and Moving.  All contain excellent tips. <br /> <br />For my fellow Agnostics and Atheists out there, yeah...she mentions God quite a bit.  You shouldn't find it offensive though.  If anything, her faith and her sometimes sugar-sweet professions of love for the reader are endearing.  Her heart is in the right place, and that's all I ask of any person frankly.  Anyone who goes out of her/his way to help others is okay in my book. <br /> <br />I may one day get to a point where I'll peruse her website for more ideas (which would mean my daily routine and zone cleaning will be a well ingrained habit...woo hoo!).  But right now I'm content with the FlyBaby progress I've made so far.  I also really enjoy re-reading sections of the book for both reminders and a shot of enthusiasm.  My house is looking so much better.  More importantly, I feel better and much more productive.  If you're on the fence, check out her website and try some of the BabySteps.  I bet once you see how much a straightened up kitchen affects your overall mood, you'll consider giving the whole FlyLady thing a try.  :o) <br /> <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|To misquote Eddie Vedder, Speaking as a fan from the '90's.... <br /> <br />Let me preface this by saying that at the time of their individual releases, I thought that Pearl Jam's last two stuido releases \\"Riot Act\\" (2002) and \\"Binaural\\" (2000) were pretty sweet records. Great Pearl Jam offereings from beginning to end. But over the last few years, I've decided that they don't quite stack up to the rest of the gems in their excellent catalogue. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy both these albums quite a bit, and there are some outstanding cuts from those two records (\\"Save You,\\" \\"Cropduster,\\" and \\"Love Boat Captain,\\" from Riot Act, \\"Insignificance,\\" \\"Of the Girl,\\" \\"Slight of Hand,\\" and \\"Grievance\\" from Binaural) but I can remember that when those albums originally came out (as I may have been suffering from an ailment called \\"new PJ buzz\\" at the time) saying that I thought both were on par with their best work of the '90's. <br /> <br />Sadly, I was wrong. <br /> <br />Now, don't get me wrong again...both albums were good, better than 98% of other bands offerings in those years, but both records were not without their flaws or filler (\\"Rival,\\" \\"Help Help,\\" and \\"Ghost\\" all spring to mind as songs best left in the vault). I also think both records would have benefited greatly if there had been some way to have simmered a bit longer, for the pot to have been stirred, songs to have been tweaked and reexamined, as well as if there had been a way to have found room to include the excellent B-sides that came from those sessions---songs like \\"Down,\\" \\"Undone \\"& \\"Other Side\\" from the Riot Act sessions, \\"Sad\\" & \\"Fatal\\" from the Binaural, all may have been the best B-sides PJ has ever produced in their history--far better than most band's best A side material. <br /> <br />(Of course, these songs are now commercially available on \\"Lost Dogs,\\" PJ's collection of B-sides, covers, & Christmas singles that came out in '03) <br /> <br />But never once in my writings didI compare Binaural or Riot Act to the perennials. No Code (1996), Yield (1998), or Vitalogy (1994) have always been considered by me as the holy trinity of PJ albums. All flawless gems, each one a five-star classic. <br /> <br />Those were the albums you'd want to play to introduce (or convert) someone to Pearl Jam. <br /> <br />Now, with all that being said as preface, this new album, eloquently titled \\"Pearl Jam,\\"at this moment, might just be my favorite Pearl Jam record ever . <br /> <br />Way better than their freshman and sophomore releases of Ten (1991) or Vs. (1993), by a long shot. More rocking than Yield or No Code, and perhaps better writing than Vitalogy. <br /> <br />There are no weak songs on \\"Pearl Jam,\\" no filler. Even the barely minute-long \\"Wasted Reprise\\" gives me the chills. The first 5 songs are, without a doubt in my mind, the most rocking five songs to ever start off a PJ record. From the poppy and catchy \\"Unemployable,\\" to the mournful \\"Gone\\" and the soulful \\"Come Back,\\" lyrically, musically, topically, this is finest offering the band has ever made us. <br /> <br />For those of you who have been waiting...for those of you saying that Pearl Jam was a great band who had never given us their great album, the eponymous release \\"Pearl Jam\\" is finally Pearl Jam's \\"Who's Next.\\" Finally, this is their \\"Physical Graffiti.\\" This is their \\"White Album\\". <br /> <br />Or to be more modern in reference, this is their \\"OK Computer,\\" their \\"Elephant\\" their \\"The Woods.\\" <br /> <br />This is the record you'll want to hand someone in 50 years time and say, \\"Here. This was what the finest American rock band in history sounded like in their prime. Enjoy.\\" <br /> <br />Though the world of music, and the real world might both be spinning in the toilet. With wars and debt and disease and hopelessness abounding, we can still look to and rock out with Pearl Jam, as they have given us something very special with this record.
B00005JO1R|2.0|The \\"extras\\" are all out-takes and posed pictures of Joaquin and Reese in-character.

B000002UAR|5.0|Because the Beatles mastered so many innovations in pop music and songwriting, any attempt to pick a work and claim it as their crowning achievement is almost futile.  Critics have spent much space defending their rendering of the best Beatles' albums, and, significantly, most of them have a good case.  'Revolver' is arguably the best Beatles' album because they reached the height of their songwriting powers and mastered a variety of musical forms.  The album finds them at the cusp of their career, just before they ended touring.  'Revolver' harnesses their best aspects with the energy of their early years and the creative mastery of their later years.  The variety is also greatest on 'Revolver' (except for 'The White Album,' which is also a masterpiece, but integrated less expertly).<br /><br />John and Paul split ways musically.  Paul's contributions are magnificent, but more traditional.  For starters, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" made a formidable double A-sided single.  It is taken for granted that both songs were innovative.  The former has rich sounds and great background effects.  The latter hasn't aged as well, but is one of the most frequent of The Beatles' songs to be put in poetry anthologies.  It is bleak, but beautiful.  His love songs are as haunting as ever.  \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" is articulate, if not ephemeral, but \\"For No One\\" is spendid, including a fine French horn solo.  His best contribution, however, is \\"Got to Get You into My Life,\\" featuring one of his best vocal performances and a lively brass band accompaniment.  He also rounds out the C.D.'s mood with another playful and eloquent number, \\"Good Day Sunshine\\".<br /><br />Conversely, John's songs are more avant-guarde.  \\"She Said, She Said,\\" \\"Dr. Robert,\\" and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" are all remarkable.  The guitars edge is razor sharp on each of these songs, and the lyrics are abstract and fascinating.  Then, \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" stretches The Beatles' repertoire even further, complete with a Harrison guitar solo that simulates yawning.  However, the finale', \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" redefines the group as never before.  With wild and mesmerizing background music, John sings into a storm of sounds with his abstract images and philosophical statements. (Subjectively, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" is the best song. It has nonsense lyrics and progressive guitar patters that showcase the Beatles as only a lucky few know them. It is a song about unrequited love in reverse [if that makes sense], a rejection of someone of pompous self-importance, sung with great trajectory by John.)<br /><br />George also is fantastic, for keeping up with his guitar on the smorgasboard of music, but his three songs are superb as well.  \\"Taxman\\" is great hard-rock with some of the sharpest commentary of any Beatles' song.  \\"Love You To,\\" is a mesmerizing display of George's affinity to Eastern religion and culture.  And, the spirited \\"I Want to Tell You\\" is perhaps the most underrated of Harrison's Beatles' songs.<br /><br />Song for song, 'Revolver' is the most varied and magnificent of their albums.  It is a worthy purchase.  For only having three songs as singles (one posthumous to the group) and so many  songs that were even better, 'Revolver' is a must for fans, especially those who may be tired of their familiar accomplishments.with a Harrison guitar solo that simulates yawning.

For only having three songs as singles (one posthumous to the group) and so many  songs that were even better, 'Revolver' is a must for fans, especially those who may be tired of their familiar accomplishments.
B000FC2FVA|4.0|If you've ever seen Phoenix in concert, or at very least heard last year's \\"Live! 30 Days Ago,\\" you already know that the band's stage performances are a lot more high-energy than the laidback, feel-good pop of their last two albums would suggest. And that's where \\"It's Never Been Like That\\" seems to pick up. Forget about their Air connections or early Daft Punk-inspired electro-disco tracks like \\"Heat Wave,\\" the French quartet's latest is a poppin' rock record, filled with more jangling guitars than the Strokes have been able to muster over the last few years. But don't let that assertion scare you into thinking that Phoenix are jumping on the garage bandwagon a couple of years too late, because that's not the case. Written in the studio with much of the album recorded in one-takes, singer Thomas Mars -- Sofia Coppola's lucky boyfriend -- is still coming up with non-ironic vocal hooks that could sound at home on your favorite MOR station, sandwiched between hits by Hall & Oates and Steely Dan. But quirkier pop charms, from Mars' cleverly oblique lyrics to the thoughtful arrangements, probably place Phoenix closer to the good company of, say, Utopia's early-'80s records, but with a decidedly \\"indie\\" feel (one could easily compare \\"It's Never Been Like That\\" to Sloan's \\"One Chord to Another\\" or \\"Twice Removed\\"). Though old fans might be thrown off for a second by the lack of electronics, they'll be pulled right back in by tracks like \\"Long Distance Call\\" which has a charged chorus that's every bit as catchy as \\"Every Thing Is\\" and \\"If I Ever Feel Better.\\" The same can be said for the summery strum-fest of \\"One Time Too Many\\" or the ringing-guitar-driven \\"Napoleon Says,\\" while album closer \\"Second to None\\" is about as urgent as anything the band has ever done. If today's top-40 radio were at all relevant, Phoenix would be sitting at number one with a bullet in the high summer days between the 4th of July and Bastille Day.
B000002UAO|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul\\" usually ranks among the highest acclaimed Beatles' albums.  The honor is just, for the album's texture and sounds are accomplished, and the words and music are mature and magnificent.  Notably, the glorious three-part harmonies are the best of any of their albums.<br /><br />Even if it is a collaborative success, each of the Beatles came unto his own, so it makes sense to break the album down by each contributor.  McCartney created two great classics, one is hard-rock with a fun story, \\"Drive My Car,\\" and the other is a polished ballad, \\"Michelle\\".  His lesser known songs are also substantial, including \\"You Won't See Me\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You\\".  Lennon easily outdoes himself, feeling free to break away from the formula of success.  \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"Girl,\\" and \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" are all literate and musically intricate.  Each song tells a story with the economy of words that have made the Beatles legendary.  Another contribution, \\"In My Life,\\" is one of the most spare and articulate love songs The Beatles ever created.  Similarly, on \\"The Word\\" John, the evangelist, delivers a memorable philosophic, rendering the bottom line of all religions.  Both John and Paul collaborate on \\"Wait,\\" one of the best unknown treasures on the album.  George managed to get his voice in edgewise.  The variety of guitar patterns he brings to the album is masterful, but he wrote some fine songs himself.  \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"Think for Yourself\\" would have found George at the same level as John and Paul if he'd have written them one album earlier.  Nevertheless, his songwriting is merely excellent this time around.  Even Ringo has his first contribution with another country-rock song, \\"What Goes On,\\" co-written with John and Paul (creditied for Richard Starkey, his real name).  The finesse of \\"Rubber Soul\\"'s music and lyrics is striking.<br /><br />(Thankfully, the first C.D. versions of the Beatles' albums are from the British catalog.  Their American company, Capitol, did a cut and paste on every album up to 'Sgt. Pepper'.  If you are sentimental for the American albums and the memories they elicit, buy the recent Capitol collection.  Otherwise, the British collection has their music the way it was originally intended.  The British 'Rubber Soul' is more balanced than the  American counterpart.)cut and paste on every album up to 'Sgt. Pepper'.

B00005JOVH|5.0|Forget what other people say.The only reason why people say they didn't like it because of it's change. X3 had way more action than the first two. Better characters, better script. Professor Xavier didn't die. When Phoenix killed him, time stopped. When the movie was over, they showed a final scene. Prof X transfered his mind and spirit and abilities to another human life form. (Its after the credits). Their effects were amazing. Storm, Jean, Wolv, Mag ,Beast, Angel, all wiped major ass. I felt sorry for cyclops. He really loved Jean. So did Wolverine. It was excellent. X-man fans are taking this movie  personally because they're really into it. They want to see it the way they want to see it. FYI, LIFE DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY! The Phoenix was scary and to powerful to let live. The first two was silly and kind of boring. The Thrid one is the real deal. Oh, that final scene after the credits should tell you there's going to be a fourth one.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|After seeing this movie, and never having had seen the stage version, I became an instant RentHead!  I did not have the chance to see the movie in theaters, but instantly fell in love with its soundtrack.  By the time I was able to buy the movie, i had the whole thing memorized and had found my passion.  I have seriously lost count of how many times I have watched this movie and am not overexagerating in saying that I have prpbably seen it 50 times in the last three months (if not under exagerating).  The best part is that since there are so many characters in so many scenes, you can watch a different person each time and have a totally different expereince.  Adam Pascal blew me away with some of his work as Roger and I am greatly taken by his song \\"One Song Glory\\".  All in all, you should see Rent, I'm sure that you'll appreciate it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Well ofcourse the movie made from a book 375 pages long could not there be details for Austen's fan to enjoy. But truly I find the movie to be very lovable and Keira portrayed the great Lizzy of Austen and Matthew was by far a great Mr.Darcy!!!! By watching this movie now I'm tempted to buy more period movies and books. I watched it over 5 times and now have it in my mobile phone for leisure.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Amazing that there are this many reviews for a DVD that has yet to hit the store shelves. Don't get me wrong, I'll pick one up too, when it IS released! This has to be the most talked-about concert DVDs in forever! I'd like to see what kind of buzz an official, Pink Floyd-sanctioned DVD of the band's 1980-81 \\"Wall\\" concerts with Roger Waters on bass and co-lead vocals would create ..... <br />I do love Floyd. They're 1C in the great pillar of rock and roll, just behind The Who (1A) and The Beatles (1B). Let's hope the new \\"Pulse\\" DVD is worth this eternal wait!! <br /> <br />Peace
0385338686|5.0|I couldn't wait to rip open this book as soon as I had finished reading the Shopaholic series. The Undomestic Goddess made me fall in love with the characters who are realalistic but still full of that fantasy-life Sophie Kinsella writes about.  You can't count the amount of times I laughed or screamed-out at what Samantha Sweeting (the main character) was doing.  After having a bad streak with books lately, this book brought me back to my book loving world I have come to be a member of. The Undomestic Goddess is full of loving characters and real people who I can only wish I knew.
B000002MTR|4.0|This album is the black sheep of the Red Hot Chili Peppers family. Recorded during their extremely unstable mid-90s period, the album is one of the band's most reviled. Being over ten years old now, perhaps we are able to gain a fresh perspective on One Hot Minute. Of course, it was recorded with a new guitarist after the departure of John Frusciante, however that new guitarist happened to be Jane's Addiction axeman Dave Navarro. Dave's an awesome guitarist and he did a great job on this record.  <br /> <br />Comparing One Hot Minute with the Peppers' recently released double album Stadium Arcadium, you might be amazed that they're both by the same band. Stadium Arcadium is melodic with intricate melodies and musicianship and lots of abstract, almost poetic lyrics. One Hot Minute on the other hand is a hard rock record with lots of heavy guitar, lots of profanity, the songs aren't nearly as melodic, and the lyrics are certainly not nearly as impressive. So it's not a big serious piece of art like Stadium Arcadium, it's just a fun rock record. I'm a big fan of this album, and quite a few of the songs are really memorable (for me, anyways). The best songs would be Coffee Shop, Warped, One Big Mob, Falling Into Grace, Shallow Be Thy Game and Walkabout. I challenge anyone who says this album is terrible to listen to Walkabout (track number 8) and tell me you don't enjoy the heck out of it. It's one of my favorite Peppers tracks.  <br /> <br />Fans who like the intricate, mellow, soulful sounds of Californication and By The Way may not be into this record so much. But if you like the Chili Peppers best when they're rocking out and having a good time, do check out One Hot Minute and turn it up loud.
B0000YB7Z8|1.0|The material is excellent as it comes from the late 70's period, some call Tull's best. <br /> <br />I have heard the remaster which is no better sounding than the original single cd at 77 minutes. <br /> <br />The double cd contains 3 extra songs originally on the album, and no extra tracks which should have been included. <br /> <br />Don't pay double the price for 3 extra songs.  <br /> <br />Either buy the orignal cd that was produced in quantity, thus plenty of used ones around, or get the album, produced in quantity as well, so there is no way anyone should try and sell it as a rare gem.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I'm very glad to see so many positive reviews for this movie. I was wondering if I was the only one who was in total awe of it. V For Vendetta is simply an amazing movie. I was a bit worried when I heard that the Wachowski Brothers and a first-time director were involved, however within the first ten minutes of the movie my fears were washed away.  V For Vendetta is spectacular in every possible way. From the first scene to the last, the movie is completely gripping and you will not want to look away until the end credits roll. The movie is well-written, well directed and well acted. Everything about it is top-notch. Everything. I can't think of any flaws. I'm sure that there must be one somewhere, but I can't think of any. It's unbelievable that director James McTeigue is a first-timer. The movie is so beautifully and effortlessly directed that you'd assume there must be some seasoned veteran behind the camera.     Being that it was based on a graphic novel and produced by the Wachowskis, I wasn't very excited to see it figuring it would be another bloated action-fest with tons of CGI and no story and I'd be bored out of my mind. Boy, was I wrong. For one thing, V For Vendetta is not even an action movie. It has a few action scenes here and there (particularly one Matrix-style scene near the end), however for the most part it's a fantasy/sci-fi/drama. Not being a big action fan I was thrilled by the lack of action scenes. For once we have a comic book movie that is about characters, story and ideas rather than special effects and car chases and fight sequences. The actors are great too. The large, primarily British cast is uniformly excellent. Particularly worth mentioning is Hugo Weaving (best known as Agent Smith in The Matrix). Weaving gives an excellent performance in the movie despite having his face always hidden by a mask. How do you emote without your face being visible? That is the challenge and Hugo succeeds marvelously. Natalie Portman is also very goodas V's helper/love interest and John Hurt is venomous as the evil British Chancellor.     If only all of the big-budget movies to come out of Hollywood could be HALF as good as this, we'd be in excellent shape. This movie will forever erase the memories of the Matrix sequels from your mind. In fact, V For Vendetta is better than all three Matrix movies put together. Bye bye Neo. Hello V.    I think my only complaint about this movie is that I have to wait until August 1 for the DVD.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|A domino effect starts with the kidnapping of sixteen Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. Israeli must decide to strike back, but how? Golda Meir authorizes a off the record Israeli terrorist elimination squad lead by Avner (Eric Bana).<br /><br />Director Steven Spielberg keeps this film energetic with detailed events that neither condone nor condemn the act of revenge. The squad starts with love of country at all cost, but ends up with the conscience in question. Is it all worth it?<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching this intense action filled film. It took me back to the actual 1972 era and recreated that same tension.  Kudos to Mr. Spielberg! This DVD is worth adding to your collection.
B000001DVD|5.0|This album rocks my face off just as much now as it did when I was a kid...the only problem is that on my vinyl version \\"Me and My Wine\\" was on it but I can't find it on any American release of High and Dry now. Other than a missing song you just can't go wrong with this.  It's all balls to the wall but with awesome melodic songwriting.  LOOOOOOOve it......yummy!
B00005JP4W|5.0|This movie is a powerful presentation, probably the best I've ever seen. The science is solid. The scientific consensus is solid. The media have not made that consensus sufficiently clear. Worse, the Bush administration \\"edited\\" the facts. No doubt there is plenty to say on the other side of this issue. But opposing views should be framed openly for our collective evaluation. For the argument on behalf of the environment, you should see this movie. Thank you, Al Gore, for doing a splendid job in presenting this important subject.
B000AA4JMU|5.0|\\"Oliver\\" is a remarkable achievement for a musical. Each scene expertly envelops the listener and viewer into a feast of a visual and audio masterpiece. For those who hate musicals or are at least less partial, the Dicken's story will quell some of the sentimentality associated with this genre. The rough atmosphere helps with some of the songs and invites those who would have a cursory interest to join in for the fun. The characters are engaging enough to begin with, but the performances are superb. Ron Moody's Fagin is masterful, especially that he can take a hardened character and make him seem likable. An emotional connection is easily made with every character: We like Dodger (Jack Wild), love Nancy, root for Oliver (Mark Lester), and sneer at Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed), a nuanced and menacing enemy.  <br /> <br />The technical achievements are also hallmark. It is no small thing that the camera angles are expertly framed for the wide view as well as for the intimate, closer shots. (Take a look at the first \\"Annie\\" movie and see if you don't agree.) The editing, too, is great, making the scenes unfold with grandeur and a timing that is as close to perfect as a musical movie gets. The songs are great, too, even if they sometimes linger too long, especially \\"As Long as He Needs Me,\\" but at least it gives the audience a moment to pause and catch its collective breath. Some are sing-alongs, like one would expect at a lively pub, including \\"Oom Pah Pah,\\" \\"Consider Yourself\\" and \\"It's a Fine Life\\". Then, there are songs with the grandeur of \\"Who Will Buy?\\" Variety is enhanced with other songs, like \\"Boy for Sale,\\" which seems rooted in opera.  <br /> <br />This movie makes one believe it could be made today; it is so timeless. Yet, it draws so much from the old musicals and innovates with new elements, that it could only have been made in this place and time (England, 1968). It is hard to find anything (except maybe \\"The Sound of Music\\" or \\"An American in Paris\\") that matches the quality of this film. It is heart-warming, suspenseful, and engaging throughout.  <br />
B000F5FNSE|5.0|This series is one of those ones you just can not put down. When I had to I couldn't wait for the opprotunity to pick it up and contiue the adventure.  This is great for the andventurer of any age (child to adult).
B0000029DD|5.0|I first heard \\"Last Goodbye\\" listening to KCRW in Los Angeles the day after Buckley died in a drowning accident, as announced by the radio announcer, and immediately bought the CD. I was stunned by the beauty, the evenness of the album, and the originality. Most of all the voice pulled my heart strings. That was almost ten years ago. Since then, this album remains a beloved classic and deseredly so. If you're looking for a similar melancholy emotional rush, you might consider the music of Ronderlin, Magnet, Blue Boy, Midlake, Montgolfier Brothers, Jans Lekman, My Morning Jacket, and Pernice Brothers.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|ROBERT GOODWIN who I haul you say?  <br />Slow and ugly you will be you, the next time returns some to you to listen to the disc of the tree porcupine.  ignoring, illiterate.  <br />That one that he is heavy!!!  <br />Not to listen to the cd with seating and suck you will make you.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|I absolutely loved how the \\"W & G\\" series ended with the nasty queen Beverly Leslie dying (hilarious); the antics of Lila and Ben (I wonder if the writers were paying tribute to the late Gregory Hines, Ben, from Season 2>)?; Will and Grace rekindling their friendship; Jack and Karen living a happy life together; Grace with her true love, Will with his.  But, I think it would have been great to show what happened to Elliot, Jack's offspring.  I loved that character and wish that the show would have incorporated him into the last show.  After 20 years, the final part of the finale, Elliot could have been shown with a wife and kids, or anything just to have let us know what happened to him.  Elliot grounded Jack in a lot of ways, and I always loved their relationship.  Oh well, Kudos to the second best comedy ever !!! (sorry Will and Grace but I thought that those 4 lovable gals from Miami had the best show ever &lt;\\"The Golden Girls\\">).  I will surely miss \\"W & G\\".
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's Lightning if often overlooked between Kill and Puppetz. This is STILL a good album that has some fan favorites \\"Creeping Death\\" and \\"Bellz\\" as well as some songs by the great Cliff Burton. This album begins the musical maturity for Metallica as songs begin to get longer and more structured preparing for Puppetz and Justice. Also features the epic instrumental - Call of Ktulu
0802130208|5.0|From the beginning to the end I could not stop laughing. <br />The characters and situations are hysterical. Especially the main character's rantings and ravings. Priceless.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Megadeth comes up with a quasi-Black Album with this release. They never abandoned what made them Megadeth though which still makes this album worth listening too - you can still tell it is Megadeth's stuff. Dave Mustaine says that this is his personal Megadeth favorite (he even says so in the liner notes). This is no technical masterpiece like \\"Rust In Peace\\" was but still has great musicians writing and metal playing
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Being an Israeli Jew of naturally sarcastic nature as well as a lover of different and independent cinema, it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a view on the holocaust that's sensitive and respectful while also being original and unusual. While I haven't read the book - or, for that matter, heard of its existence prior to watching the film - and therefore cannot, like some other reviewers, comment on how they stack up in comparison, Everything Is Illuminated gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on that. <br /> <br />To label Everything Is Illuminated a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice, even though it is undeniably about the holocaust. So would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film, although it's about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving. Everything Is Illuminated is about Jonathan Safran Foer - played to minimalist perfection by Elijah Wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance I've seen him in yet, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all - a young American Jew, and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts, who travels to the Ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. It's also about Alex, his tour guide through the Ukraine, and Alex's grandfather. What's fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of Wood's character; but both Alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film, and turn out to be at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin's as the grumpy, self-declared blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the film. <br /> <br />Aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, what made Everything Is Illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from Alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject; several excellent films, such as The Grey Zone and Downfall, have already given us the point of view of the lower-rank Nazis who are presented as human beings who aren't necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war. Everything Is Illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before: Alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war, who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact, who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people - and maybe his own family as well - were capable of. The change in Alex's attitude - and his grandfather's - towards Jonathan, towards the Holocaust, and towards the Jewish people in general, makes the film a fascinating and original study in character development. <br /> <br />Everything Is Illuminated is a terrific directorial debut for actor Liev Schreiber, and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. It's a highly recommended viewing experience, especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and World War II.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Yes indeed that is possible. I love the vocals of Tarja Turunen and the other band members suck for kicking her out of the band! Tarja was the one who made the band get popular? There will be no other vocalist like her, tough luck Nightwish. <br /> <br />This album would be the last output for Tarja and her vocals are so soothing and haunting at times. I love this kind of operatic vocal style blended in with symphony and heavy metal backgrounds. My favorites would have to be \\"Nemo\\" (a sad song but very catchy, melodic, and lovely as well!), \\"I Wish I Had An Angel\\" (a song actually about drugs - great vocals, and the bassist's vocals are very haunting! an awsome feel to this dark song!), and \\"Dark Chest Of Wonders\\" (i love those symphonic parts and it really builds up fantasy sounding things!) <br /> <br />I am going to buy more Nightwish albums because I love them so much, this was the album that first got me into the band and i have no regrets!!
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Don't expect any bat junk like \\"shark repellant\\" in this one. It's darker than Tim Burton's and it complexly makes you forget about all the other modern incarnations of PG rated goffery. This film has a great build up and a great explanation of things. Bruce works hard and fails continually, we get to see him develop and suffer and most importantly we get a great new Bat Mobile.  <br /> <br />The only problem I had with this film is that the scarecrow just seems unnecessary. The movie worked so hard to present a new kind of realism that seems detracted from one that stupid mask appears. Henri Ducard was a good enough villain and the scarecrow just seemed to get in the way.  <br /> <br />Still all in all, this is a great picture - one that you can easily watch over and over.  <br />
B000002H97|5.0|So Metallica abandoned their thrash style for a more mainstream sound yet keeps it heavy. The songs are much catchier than previous albums, and this album is what got Metallica on the map along with \\"...And Justice For All\\". Metallica shortened up the riffs and complexity in the songs for simpler structures akin tho \\"Kill 'Em All\\" but more slower. I thought this album was still pretty good, but it doesn't live up to pre-1990s era Metallica, but after this album came out, Metallica's early 90s live shows kicked a lot more [...] than others (check out Metallica's Box Set \\"Live Sh-t: Binge & Purge\\"
B000EHSVQ4|2.0|This movie in an interesting adventure. It contains some beautiful fight sequences and even has a little bit of a heart to it. In this particular version there are also a lot of interesting extras including a developing documentary and a great featurette with historical information on Jerusalem around the 12th century.  <br />Still this movie smacked of political eisegeses. Only in a Hollywood rendition of the crusades could you expect a speech on how all religions are basically the same. The movie has a ridiculous touchy feely kind of ending. No intelligent person in their right mind could ever find this propaganda historically viable. But if you are looking to kill some time, you like \\"historical\\" epics and great battle scenes then give this one a try. Personally I found the commentaries and extras to be far better than the movie itself.  <br /> <br />
0553801503|4.0|Okay so I admit it, I was as disappointed as the rest when some of my favorites--Jon, Dany, Tyrion--weren't included in this book, but I understand that Martin had to chop it in half.  Elsewise, it would have been a heck of a long one.  It's pretty cool the way he did that, instead of cutting it off in the middle he did full storylines of some characters.  Although I'm not too fond of the idea of having to buy two books instead of one.. <br /> <br />Overall the story was pretty decent.  It was definitely his chars, his universe, his style, but somehow it didn't live up to the greatness of the previous three.  Oh well, every series has a weak spot.  I mean, there is only so much action/killing/plot twists you can do without taking time to set up, and heck if he wrote constantly in the form of the last three, we'd be complaining that it was repetative.  So I sucked it up and finished it, and I can honestly say when I closed the book I walked away satisfied and eager for the next one.  My head has constantly been turning over the newly acquired information on the characters to see how it could possibly pan out in the end--and after all, we all want to see how it ends.   <br /> <br />Although word to the wise, grab the library's hardcover if you must read it now, elsewise wait for the paperback to come out.  I just can't justify the $28 with this one.
B00005JOEA|3.0|I almost walked out of V when he started jabbering on in \\"V's\\" during the scene when he rescued Evey. I had high hope for this movie as I hoped that the Matrix producers had recovered the fumble  of Matrix: Reloaded and the pass for an interception aka Matrix: Revolution. However, I was a bit disappointed of how the movies politics seemed crammed in there to fit todays headlines. Don't get me wrong, I'm what people would call liberal, but I feel that it was just too extreme. The action sequences were great though. If they had been more focused on the acting in some areas and the story (which seemed not to fuse together), this would have been a classic movie. Still, it was great entertainment.
B000002UAX|1.0|The Beatles are one of the most overrated bands of all time. They are overrated, lame, stupid, and lousy. Each and every song except BIRTHDAY is bad, especially the horrible WHILE MY GUITAR <br />GENTLY WEEPS. Avoid all the Beatles and get Nirvana Nevermind insted.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I've listened to John Mayer for a long while.  Like most of his fans I was listening to him when his stuff first started flying around the net.  To hear this beautiful change in his music does nothing but make me happy.   <br /> <br />However, to read some of the reviews that I've read here saddens me.  Then, I realize that these people who are down-playing John's talent are the same people who, for whatever reason, never liked him in the first place.  This leaves them without a valid opinion in my book and offer little proof that can change my mind about him. <br /> <br />I bought TRY! after listening to Daughters (my all-time favorite song) and sat perplexed as to how he could have made that song any better - but he did.  Possibly it's because it's a live cut and John has a way with an audience.  Or, maybe it's just his new mature sound.  You take your pick, but it's just good.   <br /> <br />If you still yearn for that \\"traditional\\" John Mayer sound - what some people may call \\"Pop\\" or melodies laced with lyrics only welcomed to overly hormonal teenaged girls (which, yes, you can hear screaming between numbers), I would suggest you skip down to track 7, \\"Another Kind of Green\\".  No matter how much this song sends me into a flashback of a failed romance, or the 11th grade - it too is just good. <br /> <br />I could go on and on about what's \\"just good\\" about John Mayer's latest line up, but I have to stop because \\"I Got A Woman\\" (track 8) is playing right now and I have to get up and dance.  I just want to take a minute and warn potential buyers, to not fret if they read the following reviews about how John's guitar playing only sounds good because he's supplemented by an excellent bassist and drummer.  Please realize that that's what good musicians do.  They love music that sounds right, why in the world would he place himself amongst poor musicians just to make himself sound good?  It's just a stupid idea.  I'm sure if he had done that he would have been very reluctant to put Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino's name on the album cover.  The music sounds good, and if it took three people to do so, who cares?  In this day and age we need more musicians who really play, play well, and love it.  <br />
B000000W5N|1.0|Who would like a band as awful the THE ROLLING STONES?? THEY ARE OVERRATED, LAME STUPID, AND LOUSY JUST LIKE THE BEATLES AND LED <br />ZEPPELIN.

The story was turned into an extremely corny introduction to this year's Super Bowl featuring among others Harrison Ford.<br /><br />A traditional way to end the school year at any grade level is for the teacher to read his or her students the classic Dr. Seuss picture book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! The book, published in 1990 by Random House, still is an enjoyable anecdote that reflects on the trials and tribulations of growing up and proceeding through life, all the while using Seuss' trademarks of simple rhyme and surrealist imagery. Oh, the Places You'll Go! would seem familiar to fans of previous Dr. Seuss classics such as Green Eggs and Ham and The Cat in the Hat. Seuss once again utilizes his uncanny ability to use fanciful rhymes and whimsical words to weave a charming and entertaining tale that could no doubt amuse readers of any age. Unlike many of Suess's better known works, Oh, the Places You'll Go! lacks any specific characters other than a narrator and the reader. A young lad referred to simply as \\"you\\" initiates the action of the story. However, the lack of a main character helps readers to identify with the book. The pages of Oh, the Places You'll Go! are filled with bright and colorful illustrations that exceed the limits of imagination. A journey through the pages of this book is a journey through life itself. One finds one's way to the \\"Waiting Place... for people just waiting,\\" \\"the bright places where Boom Bands are playing\\" and, of course, to, \\"Great Places,\\" where one's own future lies.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Enough of this you stupid idiots who love the 60's. <br />The Beatles were one of the most overrated bands after the Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin. They only made 2 decent songs in HEY JUDE, AND THE BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO. Other than that I have to hear like 24 of the worst songs ever recorded by anyone <br />such as 'I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND'. This music is very crappy... <br />I'm afraid, go buy Dire Straits ON EVERY STREET insted. <br />Believe me, I know.
1594481938|1.0|I expected more. I went to the library to get some books on CD to pass the time in my commute, saw Hornby's name, assumed the best as his other work has been good, and now I'm just forcing myself to finish the cd's.<br /><br />It's a tedious, predictable story. There is meaningless banter back and forth between the characters with the occassional \\"deep\\" comment thrown into the mix. It feels like a recipe for a typical fiction book, \\"...first you do this, then you do this...oh and it's missing something... let me add a few more depressing comments.\\"  It reminds me of sitting on the train listening to a pack of 12 year olds pass the time. I don't even know why I'm still listening. It really feels as if he was just trying to fill the space between the back of the book and the front. Then again, nothing ever really happens in Hornby's stories, but at least you can identify with the characters. This story missed that niche completely, it's no special in the least.
B00006AW2S|1.0|Now this is another really bad song by BOSTONS MORE THAN A FEELING, QUEEN'S WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, AND STEVE MILLER'S THE JOKER....SATISFACTION. IT SUCKS. STAY AWAY FROM ALL THE ROLLING STONES.
B00000K19E|4.0|An extremely good film- great action sequences, intellectual in places- the more often you watch it the more you pick up.  Everyone wants to know the answer, surely?  This film raises some very interesting points...unlike the others in the trilogy, which were quite frankly, unnecessary.
B000002LND|4.0|Madonna's \\"Immaculate Collection\\" contains most of the essential hits from the Material Girl's early career. Eliminate the hype and you have durable pop classics such as \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Vogue.\\" Purists may argue, but the extended remixes of \\"Into the Groove,\\" \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Like a Prayer\\" are superior to the original singles. Until a lavish box set comes along, this 1990 compilation remains the finest showcase for Madonna as Recording Artist.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Gnarls Barkley's collaboration effort \\"St. Elsewhere\\" is an album that is actually worth all the hype it's been receiving lately.      Cee-Lo, from the Goodie Mob, has been a so-so rapper at best.  But as a quasi-soul singer fronting Gnarls Barkley, he's great.  Cee-Lo's voice has always been his best unique trait.  He could read his grocery list and make it sound cool.    The production on the album from Danger Mouse is frenetic at times.  The beats are hip-hop meets upbeat electronica with some blues samples, with the kitchen sink thrown in.  Somehow, it all works out.    At first listen I thought some of the songs were a little annoying.  But then I found myself singing the hooks later.  So it is a very catchy album.    Someone's review compared this to DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, which is way off base.  The closest comparison for this album, is Gnarls Barkley is this decade's Dr. Octagon.  Both albums have experimental producers (Danger Mouse vs. Dan the Automator) mixed with relatively-obscure frontmen (Cee-Lo vs. Kool Keith).  Both albums are a little strange, but very uniqe and cool.      Even though St. Elsewhere is relatively short in terms of length, it's solid throughout.  There's not a lot of excessive filler here.  Good stuff - recommended!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|this is very creepy movie made even more so by the fact that its based on a true story. If you don't belive in God and the Devil, by the end of this movie you may change your mind.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|There are no words to describe this movie. It is 1 of my all time favorites! It is full of interesting story lines, beautiful people and of course your classic romantic fairytale only told in a real life way. I love this movie! I've watched it hundreds of times and I never get sick of it!
B00000J7JO|4.0|after the departure of john frusicante and the commerical failure of \\"one hot minute\\" with ex guitarist for jane's addiction dave navarro. and when they were about to compile a new album, frusicante decided he wanted too be involve with the sex magic and energetic funk that was to be a beacon in his life.  <br />and this is their most heart felt, album,.with kiedis writing beautiful and heart touching lyrics and frusicante gently laying the riffs to pulverise and gently massage at the same time..  <br /> <br />this album..attracted the attention of those ppl they weren't into the chili's and all around america..as stated in anthony kiedis book scar tissue, the chili's were blasting from the car radio's in every city,  <br /> <br />this is easily the best album of 1999 is it the best chili's album, NO that would be mother's milk or their new and soon too be classic \\"stadium arcadium\\"  <br />\\"by the way\\" the 2002 masterpiece also needs to be submitted  <br />in content with the aforementioned.  <br /> <br />this album had four cklassic singles and SORCHING VIDEO'S  <br />scar tissue, around the world,californication, and otherside,  <br /> <br />there's noway on this earth that you don't need not to pick this up, PUT THIS SUCKER IN YOUR CD PLAYER AND BE READY TO BE BLOWN AWAY, it has the funk and the ballads to even the scale's on the perception that the chili's had lost their funk rock roots BAH   <br /> <br />
B000F3TBIO|5.0|This friggin' album rules.  Since, of course, Patton is the man and can't write a bad track, contrary to what some may say, I should've known.  However, if we assume things, we make an ass out of.. well you get the idea.  Nice to hear Patton going at it instrumentally; it's such a rare thing. Can't wait for the tour, this thing is going to explode live.  AND BY THE WAY, This album can be on radio if we stop being selfish and request it at our local radio stations.  Does it matter if you listen to the radio? NO! It's not for you, it's for Mr. P. You know the guy who slaved in a kitchen to cook you up a nice helping of aural delicacies. I know what you want to say,\\"What if it makes him too big? I don't want a bunch of jerks at the show.\\" Those people might buy the album, true, but don't worry.  They may try to get some of his other work and be too scared to see him live OR it may help some kid who desperately needs something to help him get his act together, do what he needs to do, and realize that there are others out there like him, who are lovers of true music, not haters. Get this album, you won't regret it, unless you are a hammysink.  What the Hell is a hammysink?
B000EWBKM6|1.0|Not sure why anyone would just go out and buy the last 45 min episode when a 6 Disc boxset Complete Season 8 with all 23 episodes including this one will be released in the U.K on 7/8/2006!!!!!!!!!!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|My family decided to all sit down and watch a movie together. My son chose to watch Nanny McPhee. Thier dad and I tried to talk him out of it at first. We were not to sure about it. Boy were we wrong!!!! This is such a good movie. We loved every minute of it. We had such a good time watching it that if it wasn't so late we probably would have sat through it again. It is well worth buying!!!!!
B000669GAI|5.0|After reading some really lame 1-star reviews I felt the need to post my vision on this album. I think it's a great 'intro' album for the unitiated and also a great addition for the fans, with remixes from old songs and some tracks you can't find on other PJ albums. Besides that, the concept of the 'up' and 'down' discs and the sublime packaging make this a nessecity for your PJ collection. A great job has been done with the song-selection. Some albums may be underexposed but this collection selects their most well-known songs, each of them can't be missed at all and it leaves room for surprises to fill out 2 excellent cd's. Awesome!
B0006FFRW0|5.0|I played this very album in my computer many times.  Just because your computer is garbage doesn't mean this album deserves one star.  It is a foray into emotional turmoil that everyone but the most sheltered mommy's boy has gone through.
B00005JOYA|2.0|I for one have let off many video games movies like ( Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat 1&2, Tomb Raider 1& 2, Resident Evil 1&2, and Doom. Exluding the work of Uwe Boll.) off with a warning for the longest time.  But now they should have figured something out by the time they got to Silent Hill, about what they been doing wrong with video game movies.  Though there are few moment here and there in the film, where you think the movie is about to get good but I just falls back on its ass once again. The final with the barb wire was pretty cool, but the rest of the end just sucked. The dialogue is just terrible. The performane are terrible. You don't care about none of the characters, because they don't develop at all in the movie ( with the exception of the girl Sharon). Now video game movies are here to stay, but they should put alot more effort into  how they make these kinds of movies now. Or perhaps they should just this kind of genre  a five year rest, and come back to it with a refreshed sense of thinking.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I felt that the crux of the movie was to be how much Elizabeth and Darcy did not like each other and how that changed over time. I never bought into that in this movie. I got the impresion they always liked each other from the start.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|Let me start off by saying I own Akira, Appleseed, many of the Miyazaki movies, and even Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within...you know, all the beginner anime. While the previous Final Fantasy movie made it seem like there was some background I was missing, it was very watchable. But man I had no idea what was going on in this movie. Stuff happens, lots of stuff. I even read up on some of the reviews beforehand to familiarize myself with what the background was. Let me tell you that if you're not intimately familiar with the background, you're gonna be confused. I would have to summarize this movie as the next installment of the video game series...but you can't play it...you have to watch it. <br /> <br />On a technical level, I don't get why everybody is so ga-ga over it's \\"beauty\\" (although I didn't read all 345 reviews!). The CGI is subpar as far it goes today. I've seen homemade stuff these days that looks only slightly worse. The most noticeable problem is in the rendering of the characters' hair. On a realism level, the laws of physics are all but thrown out the door (one character wields a sword that might as well be a Buick on a stick, but does it look like it has any weight? Heck no, he swings it like a billy club). The sound is also rather weak. While the LFE channel is used, it's used modestly. Most of the action has no weight. <br /> <br />In general, if you're not a fan of the Final Fantasy series of games, I suggest avoiding this movie. The subpar CGI and audio in this movie does nothing to make the jumbled plot more tolerable.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Outstanding dynamic energy of the rawest is on hand here. They are still in the running with their finger on the pulse of what makes good rock work and why it ever came into being in the first place. I like the entire CD. Put it in and just feel bitter force. That's an interesting cover. Welcome back.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I only heard lateralus for the first time about a year ago and i was absolutley blown away by the intricate details to an album as apparantly hard rock as it was.  Therefore i was waiting for 10000 days with baited breath, and, despite some quite negative reviews from other fans on this site, i was certainly not dissapointed.  i find it impossible to pick a favourite from an album that has barely left my cd player for a month, the range of sound from the pounding openers of vicarious and Jambi to the less traditional sound of the Pot makes this an enthralling album that just takes a little time to get into.  I personally would rank this album right up there with lateralus and aenima - lets just hope we dont have to wait another 5 years with only a perfect circle to tie us over
B000035P5E|5.0|It is very rear to see a movie that stands up to it's literary origins. And almost never a movie is better than the book, save \\"The Godfather\\" and a few others. This movie does not surpass Follet's masterpiece but it is it's equal.   <br /> <br />Richard  Marquand direction is impeccable and tight, the recreation of the WWII era is top notch. Even the complicated love story blends within the other elements and does not distract but adds to the overall viewing pleasure. <br /> <br />Kate Nelligan and Christopher Cazenove have never been better; and what to say about Donald Sutherland, he was born to play \\"The Needle\\". <br /> <br />I would read he book first and then,  do yourself a favor and watch this. WWII thrillers don't come much better than this movie. <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Okay, so I was never introduced to the Final Fantasy games properly. My first game I played was Final Fantasy VIII. Boohoo. Thanks to a co-worker who was so stoked about this video game movie, he explained everything to me. So I knew what I was getting into and what was going on. I've seen this movie a few times and I've grown to really like it. Watch the Reminnisence of Final Fantasy to get the head's up! The more you watch this movie the more understanding you'll get.  <br /> <br />Not recommended for those who never liked the video games. For those who love the games, you'll love the movie even if the plot itself can be confusing. It rocks!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Like my title says, this movie is spectacular. The graphics are purely amazing, the voice acting was done terifically, the music was awesome although kind of weird in some places, and the fight scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. The only thing that I had a problem with was the story. I couldn't follow it at all. But, I think that the graphics, voice acting, music, and awesome fight scenes make up for it.  <br /> <br />In all, I think that Square Enix did a amazing job on Advent Children and I Congratulate them for it. If they make another Final Fantasy movie I will most certanly buy it without question. But, until then Advent children will just have to do. <br /> <br />
B000002C25|3.0|This is by far my least favourite Oasis album. Though many songs are actually quite good ( a few very good ), the production makes it hard to listen to the album for very long. Most tracks are burdened down by numerous over-dubs of distorted guitars, and the songs generally go on for way too long.<br /><br />Fortunately there are moments of pleasure too.<br /><br />\\"Don't Go Away\\" is an Oasis ballad like when they are best; a wonder this fine song was not released as a single.<br /><br />\\"Stand By Me\\" is almost as good, but it suffers a bit from going on for too long.<br /><br />\\"All Around the World\\" is the perfect closing track. It has a fine acoustic intro and an extremely catchy chorus. Though it is the longest track on the album it really doesn't feel like it. I would have cut off 2-3 minutes, though.<br /><br />The Beatles-inspired \\"Girl in the Dirty Shirt\\" is also quite good.<br /><br />The opening track, and the first single, \\"Do You Know What I Mean\\" may have sounded right in 1997, but the song has not aged very well, and it's more or less a drag listen though this overloaded and longwinded recording.<br /><br />Most of the rockers are not up the standards of early Oasis.<br /><br />At a certain point Noel said something about remixing the album; that would really be interesting. I'm sure a much better album could come of that.
B00007KWHG|5.0|All of these songs were from before my time. Even so, they were so much a part of the culture when I was growing up that I can claim them as my own. They are definitely dated as to style and the sound of the recordings but they are still great recordings. <br /> <br />Anyone who has a bit of nostalgia for the pop music of the 50s and 60s should love this one. It is thoroughly enjoyable. <br />
B000005IS1|5.0|The only reason I mention the fact that this is not punk -- I was there at the Electric Circus in Manchester, England in 1977 to see the Stranglers, the Damned, and many others -- is that it might put people off who would otherwise be amazed by this album. I once managed to convert a rabid Ted Nugent fan, for example. Punk is essentially speedball thrash (in a good way!), but this is akin to Led Zep and the Who (the MC5 supported them at a Toronto gig in 1968: sheer musical mayhem!). The MC5 were not a Nuggets-style band (and again, I have no problem with such bands), but heavily influenced by the likes of boundary-pushing jazz giants like John Coltrane and Sun Ra (in fact, there's a Sun Ra piece on this very album). The true \\"soul brothers\\" of this all-time classic are the Who's heaven-storming Young Vic live album (Who's Next deluxe edition), Live at Leeds, Albert Ayler's Live in Greenwich Village, and Peter Brotzmann's Machine Gun.  <br />But when are we going to get a remastered edition that really let's the dials stray into the red, like Iggy's Raw Power?
B000F3TBIO|5.0|I didn't really know what to think about this release. I was certainly anticipating it, as I do with any upcoming Patton release. Faith No More and Mr. Bungle rank among my favorite bands, so I always look forward to hearing more music from the demented genius behind the two innovative acts. I have heard nearly all of his releases, including all of the Faith No More albums, all of the Bungle releases, some of his guest work with Bjork on \\"Medulla\\", the track he did on the Handsome Boy Modelling School disc \\"White People\\", both Tomahawk albums, most of the Lovage album, and his work with the X-cutioners. Two things I look for in Patton releases are his unreal vocal performances (which is basically a given), and creativity/ innovation. So when I first heard the single \\"Mojo\\", I was a tad apprehensive about its commercial sound even though I loved the track. Peeping Tom was being hailed as his \\"pop\\" record, after all, and I wasn't quite sure what to make of this claim. On top of this, I had really struggled to get into the X-Cutioners album, and was thus slightly wary of being able to enjoy this next release. I shelled out 15 dollars on the day of the discs release, and I was absolutely ecstatic. This is the closest work he's done to Faith no More since Tomahawk's self titled debut.The songs are all great, and Patton delivers a top-notch vocal performance (as always). It manages to be both bizarre yet strangely accessible, which may be why it is being hailed as a \\"pop record\\". Probably none of these songs will ever receive airplay, but they won't send your sane friends screeching out of your car if you play it for them in the same manner that say, \\"Suspended Animation\\" would. Collaborators include Massive Attack, Kool Keith, Norah Jones, Dan the Automator, Kid Koala, and others. Absolutely essential listening for 2006.
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|The Janine Jansen recording of that old Vivaldi standard \\"The Four Seasons\\" (which itself is bordering on being hackneyed through over-use) just arrived. As one review I read somewhere noted, it is indeed probably not for most folks. Only eight instruments are used: 2 violins (Jansen plays a Strad.), viola, cello, double bass, box organ, theorbo(!!), and harpsichord.<br /><br />This one DEMANDS that you pay attention to it; it is absolutely chock-full of subtlety and nuance that the casual listener would probably fail to appreciate, if not find downright grating in places. If you seek background music for your garden party, there are dozens of excellent recordings of this work that fit that bill.<br /><br />I've heard things in the score I've never heard in other recordings, even discounting a bit of improvisational embellishment. The excessive voluptuousness of full string orchestra often mooshes everything out into an easily digestible pablum for public consumption.<br /><br />She handles both serene and frenetic passages with the ability one would expect from the temporary custodian of a Stradivarius. Her tempi (and transitions) are often surprising, as are the dynamics. There are times when one feels the instruments are being pushed right to their limits, (occasionally sounding like it verges on instrument abuse) thus generating tonal qualities seldom heard in this piece. I am mightily impressed.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|How do you improve something like eat a peach.  Add a second disc of the Allman Brothers legendary performance at the closing of the Fillmore on 6/27/71.  Long available in trading circles, this version is a blinder.  If you already own EAP (as most Allman Bros fanatics do) the thing to do may be to download the bonus disc from ITunes, but if you don't own EAP, get this version-well worth the extra cash.

B00005UW9T|5.0|Anastasia was my favorite childhood movie. Naturally, I was delighted to learn more about the real Anastasia in my russian history class. After I had completed the class, I rewatched the disney Anastasia and saw that many things in the movie was based on real russian history- about St. Petersburgh, The palace, the romanovs, and even the the villian, Rasputin. True, it isn't all historically accurate, but definately a learning experience for the kids.

B00005JM02|3.0|Finding Nemo is the tale of a little fish, Nemo, becoming lost from his overprotected father and then the father's quest to find Nemo. Not your usual children's movie with several well known quotes (\\"Just keep swimming\\"; \\"I speak whale! OOOOOOOOOOO\\") A very cute little movie, though I feel it has been slightly over rated by all the Nemo-Lovers, is worth seeing my children and even adults, just for the experience.

B000BB1MI2|4.0|So here we have the remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Good story + Johnny Depp, can't go wrong. Though I must admit that Johnny Depp's whole look (especially haircut) was somewhat frightening. Anywho, Charlie of course wins his golden ticket along with several other obnoxious children (I quite enjoyed Verooka) and tours Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Some nice special effects with Wonka's flashbacks make the story quite interesting. Definately a keeper.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I was initally forced to watch Veronica Mars: a couple of months ago, my friend said he would loan me the Freaks and Geeks boxset, which I had wanted to watch for a long time. Instead, he brought me Veronica Mars and told me he wouldn't give me F&G until I watched the UPN detective show. Like most, I was skeptical . . . but now, I can't thank him enough.  <br /> <br />It took me four days to watch the first season, and I downloaded the second season that had aired until that point and finished watching it as it aired on UPN. The second season was excellent, but this first season is absolutely perfect. The dialogue, the stories, and oh, the ACTING. Kristen Bell is amazing as Veronica, and Jason Dohring, playing Logan Echolls, is absolutely superb. Enrico Catolani as Veronica's father is warm and a perfect ally and foil to his daughter, while Francis Capra's Weevil is the pitch-perfect bad boy with a heart of gold. <br /> <br />The first season follows Veronica's quest to find the murderer of her best friend, Lilly Kane. Helping her along, whether they know it or not, are her father, Logan, Weevil, best friend Wallace (Percy Daggs III), and ex-boyfriend Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn). But you've probably already read enough plot summaries. My main objective here is to tell you that if you are hesitant to watch, DON'T BE. Buy the season 1 and 2 DVDs and watch season 3 this fall -- this year, it has been given a kinder time slot (Tuesdays at 9:00, immediately following Gilmore Girls), which will hopefully increase viewership.  <br /> <br />Don't miss out on one of the best shows ever. Buy the DVDs.
B0007CNXUU|5.0|I checked this out from the library primarily as a family film to watch with my daughters, but my wife and I ended up watching it alone.  What a delightful film!  The acting of Depp, Winslet and the boy actors was absolutely sublime!  As several of the other reviewers noted, not many films can be silly without being stupid, romantic without being risque and aspirational without being preachy, but this film managed to do all three.  It never ceased to be plausible--which is my most common complaint with films--and never insulted my intelligence.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've been a Knopfler fan for a long time but never new what a songbird Emmy Lou was.  At times her lilting voice is totally moving.  Surprisingly, Knopfler's understated vocals are a perfect match. And Knopfler's signiture guitar is written all over the album.  Just get it and listen to it three times through.  At least 5 songs will grow on you immediately.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Men often have the sense that they need to maintain their masculinity to be appreciated by society. (often women) Since I pursue a career that work very closely with men to achieve the personal and social status they want to achieve, I have constantly heard my fellow brothers talk about the movie as if it is a meteor that has crashed on Earth just because there are two guys in this movie kissing and making out. My response is: big deal? <br /> <br />This movie crossed the boundaries many viewers place on themselves about how \\"human beings\\" should behave. In fact, I am sure that many female viewers of this movie understand more about the \\"attraction\\" and \\"love\\" that made and destroyed these two characters better than most men do. But putting all that aside, I think all of us can agree that this movie has many extraordinary values, and if we can accept these values, or even appreciate these values for the true messages this movie delivers, then doesn't it just make sense that, whatever your viewpoint is, this is still a movie worth watching? <br /> <br />Great job hollywood, keep up the good work.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|While this is a decent version of the movie and I did buy a copy; it is really like owning the \\"Cliff Notes\\" version for evenings when I don't have time to see the whole spectacular movie that was by A&E starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Erhle. The characters in this version, directed by Joe Wright are not well developed, you do not have a chance to fall in love and understand them. The portrayl and development of the rest of the Bennet family, aside from Elizabeth, is rushed and mediocre.  Elizabeth herself swings in her moods from giggly girl to proud woman; yet no constancy of character.  Mr Darcy (Macfadyen) is a saving grace in this film. His facial expressions and delivery save his character and he does the part justice.  You just wish for more scenes with Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Overall, I like the movie for a dose of Pride & Prejudice on a night when I don't have time for the \\"real thing\\". But for those of you who really love the book and love this genre of film...treat yourself to the A&E/BBC version.  You will not be disappointed.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is just as good as the movie. Anyone who liked the movie should purchase this soundtrack. This is one of those soundtracks that you can listen to over and over. Klaus produces yet another great movie score. This soundtrack is so good that I can't wait for the second one to come out.
6305263248|4.0|When one considers director John Frankenheimer's career, it's almost a wonder he was ranked up there with other top names of his time like Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorcese; because for as many classic hits that he turned out (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, THE TRAIN, BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ, GRAND PRIX & BLACK SUNDAY), there were just as many stinkers.  Anyone remember FRENCH CONNECTION II, 52 PICK-UP and a particularly bad monster movie called PROPHECY?  His 1996 remake of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU was so bad, I concluded then and there that Marlon Brando should never again be in front of the camera!  Perhaps if RONIN had been released a couple of years later, Frankenheimer's final swan song would not have been the forgettable REINDEER GAMES.    Through all of its tense spy thriller action and several genuine car chase scenes, the viewer hardly feels cheated by never knowing what's inside the mysterious case (a-la PULP FICTION) that the team of mercenaries, lead by Robert DeNiro, is after.  Jonathon Pryce plays a chilling, frightening role as Seamus, a rogue Irish terrorist hell-bent on retrieving the case for himself.  Hard to believe this guy is a song-and-dance man, also.    Hands-down, RONIN is one of the most intelligent action spy thrillers ever made; a film that easily puts the more popular genre of DIE HARD and LEATHAL WEAPON movies to shame.
B000002UR7|1.0|I could give a long winded review on how bad this album is, but let me just say this... Radiohead is one of the few bands that I fell for all the hype about.  What an idiot I was, I bought this cd and listened to it about 20 times trying to figure out what it was that I was missing.  I finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever.  The song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable.  Garbage folks that is all this amounts to.  The most overated band of all time perhaps? Oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes I didn't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance, let me say... it ahas all been done before.  You just have to dig a little deeper than MTV and Rolling Stone magazine to find it.  Don't believe the hype!
0224076051|5.0|Back in 1988, Richard P. Feynman wrote about string theory before dying:    \\"... I do feel strongly that this is nonsense! ... I think all this superstring stuff is crazy and is in the wrong direction. ... I don't like it that they're not calculating anything. ... why are the masses of the various particles such as quarks what they are? All these numbers ... have no explanations in these string theories - absolutely none! ...\\" (Davies & Brown, `Superstrings' 1988).    String theorists hate Feynman and want to destroy the credibility of physics by turning it into a religion (check out the $1 million Templeton Prize for religion which has been awarded to string theory advocates including Davies and Barrow).  String theorists will be BITTERLY disappointed to discover that the book - as actually printed and published (someone bitter has reviewed a two-year old draft version of the book here on amazon) - has been proof read very carefully and does not contain any errors of fact.    But some string theorists may be offended if they are confused about the difference between facts and opinions (seeing that string theory does not contain even a single hard fact or checkable prediction!).  String theory contains 10 dimensional superstring-supersymmetry speculation, 11 dimensional supergravity and spin-2 graviton speculation, so-called brane speculations and the more sensible and predictive speculation that the string theorist's special \\"mathematical skills are assumed to derive from a special 'mental vacuum state'\\", made by Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson in his arXiv paper number 0312012: \\"String Theory, Universal Mind, and the Paranormal\\".  The nonsense injected into this science by such \\"string theory\\" is very worrying for us all.    I found the book to be, if anything, too weak in arguing its finding that there is nothing scientific in string theory.  Being too constructive, the author is apologist for the state of the art, and blames the sluggish developments on a mere over-concentration of talents in a single far-fetched design.  This reader feels that the author should have placed the blame squarely on what Josephson called the 'mental vacuum state'.    This is not a book which was written specifically for the great advocates of string theory mathematics like Professors Brian Josephson (who won his Nobel Prize for work in electromagnetism, a practical and therefore totally different subject), Edward Witten, Lisa Randall, and arXiv trackback dominating personalities like Jacques Distler and Lubos Motl.  If the book was about these people, it would not be of interest to science.    Instead, this is an exciting book written by a real world physicist who understands a lot and doesn't raise a warning unless he has a very good reason.  The author was educated to post-doctorate level and developed applications for Edward Witten's quantum chromodynamics solution.  He is Lecturer in Discipline and has taught quantum field theory recently.    Readers will find the best ever popular introduction to the Standard Model, written by someone working on its applications at the time it was being bedded in.  Readers will also find in the book a clear and well balanced guide to string theory.    The author is constructively critical and does produce insightful suggestions for improving the current situation, difficult as it is for string theorists to find funding.  He explains the facts about the \\"landscape\\" of solutions to string theory and other fundamental problems which prevent it from making any unique statements.    But the book is worth buying if only for the lucid summary of the Standard Model the author understands so well...  A book to really treasure? Definitely!  A classic and a turning point in physics?  Yes (if the media can learn to ignore stringy hype).

Nevertheless, being in the minority here, I truly wonder what I might be missing.  I beseech and BEG the admirerers of this book to cite a paragraph, a sentence or a turn of phrase they consider to be masterful and comic, or just comic, or just masterful.  I ask that in sincerity because, far from finding anything humorous or well written, let alone masterful, I found myself astonished that anyone could be even mildly amused or impressed, other than by the fact that the author actually had the will power to watch this much paint dry.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|This is an excellent movie with several themes woven together.  The main theme is a how a clique of four boys, principally Dave, feel like outsiders in their hometown of Bloomington Indiana as they search for an identity after high school.  They are starting to realize that their search will inexorably pull them apart.  None of the four are in college, and Bloomington's local economy, especially the fading quarries, seems to hold little promise aside from serving the Indiana University (IU) college students.  The IU students derisively call local kids \\"cutters\\" in reference to the quarries the local kids' fathers worked in.  The four in fact have a favorite closed quarry as their hangout and swimming pool, and they resent it when the IU kids want them to stay off the IU campus but feel free to invade this quarry.  Two of the four had ideas for college athletics, but are aimless now that their high school careers are over and do not provide structure.  There are several excellent scenes depicting their confusion and disappointment over what to do next.  My favorite is when the four are watching Indiana football practice.  Ex-football player Dennis Quaid still keeps in shape, and he says that he can't bring himself to light the cigarettes he keeps in his mouth because he can't get give up his opinion that he was a pretty good high school quarterback and should be on the college gridiron.  Now he's just \\"20-yr old Mike\\".  Eventually he will be just \\"30-yr old Mike\\" and then just \\"40-yr old Mike\\".  Every year there will be new contenders for starting quarterback, and \\"every year it's not gonna be me.\\"  Daniel Stern, as Cyril, has to overcome his dad's low expectations and too-willing acceptance of failure even though Cyril is a talented person.  Meanwhile, Dave, like many adolescents, has a silly, romantic ideas of what he will become.  He decides to transform into an Italian because his passion is cycling, and because he believes Italians are the best cyclists then heshould become Italian too.  Dave is played by Dennis Christopher, who was raised Catholic in Philadelphia and has a real last name of Carelli.  So Dave adopts an accent, listens to Italian opera and language records, calls the family cat \\"Fellini\\", and teachse his parents about supposed Italian family values from what seem to be the 1920s.  His dad is adamant as he addresses the cat: \\"Your name is Jake, dammit!\\"  Dave's struggle with and eventual reconciliation with his dad provides about half of the movie and comedy.  His dad, who is no great role model himself, has conflicting ideas of what Dave should become,  The dad does not realize that he is silly himself with what he does and should expect more from Dave.  The actors, Paul Dooley as the father and Dennis Christopher as Dave, are so convincing that according to IMDB they have played father and son on three occasions!  The father is the funniest person in the movie; so funny that you forget the poignancy of what is happening.  Several scenes are so unforgettable that I still think of them, for example when I hear the word \\"Refund!\\".  After you see the movie you might do the same.  Another theme, already alluded to, is that of the townies vs college kids.  A colleague of mine used to live in Bloomington, and she says this rivalry is profound.  The four are able to fight back against the college kids by representing the townies in the the \\"little 500\\", a bike race which is a huge event on IU's campus.  Apparently IU has built a new stadium for this race because it is so popular.  Oh yes, this is also an underdog movie about athletics, in this case cycling.  We see Dave's cycling career cycle up and down throughout the movie, culminating in The Big Race, the \\"little 500.\\"  Two of the actors, Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern, were up and coming, while one, Jackie Earle Hailey, had seen better days as Kelly Leak in \\"Bad News Bears\\" although he still gets roles.  According to IMDB, Dennis Christopher has had a productive career mainly on television.  This movie has a very wide appeal and is suitable for high schoolers and adults alike.  I think it would be especially good for adolecents as they struggle with their identity.  There is profanity and a few things about about girls that adolescent boys would say, but I recommend it wholeheartedly.  It is one of those fine movies that gets overlooked but is a wonderful discovery.
0436350238|5.0|My first book by Orwell was Animal Farm which fascinated me and that I have read several times since leaving secondary school about three decades ago. I then read 1984 and again having been thrilled by both the message and good writing skills, led me to seriously search more books by this remarkable author. I then read Homage to Catalonia followed by Down and Out in Paris and London.<br /><br />In \\"Down and Out in Paris and London\\", Orwell gives vivid and enlightening picture of the plight of the poor in London and Paris in the early 1900s. The book was written in 1933 and is partly based on his life experiences in Paris and London living the life of the poor of the poorest. He gives the reader a picture of what it is to be without money, shelter and being hungry and not knowing when the next meal is coming. He also describes the shameful and bleak lives of tramps in London, who were relying on begging and sleeping rough in filthy accommodation, whom he describes as \\"docile and broken-spirited creatures\\". The middle class is given insights into the life of the vagrants, and explains that they are not just worthless people who brought their own misery to themselves and suggests ways that society can ease their plight.<br /><br />This is another thrilling book by Orwell that makes reading the book an enjoyable and enlightening experience. The way that he portrays the human condition when people are very poor and desperately eking out a living; people living solitary and miserable lives; people living eccentric lives, freed by poverty and deprivation from normal standards of behavior is marvelous. I find it remarkable that Orwell, who came from middle class background, had to live for a time with the poor and so enlightened the world of their condition. The book provides an excellent historical perspective of life for the poor in the 1920s and 1930s. Things have since radically changed in France and Britain (indeed in all the developed countries) since the 1930s, with an advanced welfare system in place. However, his insights about misconceptions about the poor are still relevant today, particularly as to why they are so poor, their attitude to charity and malnourishment.ce the 1930s, with an advanced welfare system in place.

0156421178|5.0|George Orwell in \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" wrote an outstanding book on his perspective of the Spanish civil war not a journalist reporting on what they saw in war, but from the view of someone who participated in the War in 1936 and 1937. Orwell and his comrades, armed with raw idealism but ill-equipped with little training,  fought in the war for seven months as a private near Barcelona on the side of the loyalist (Republican) government forces.<br /><br />On the one hand were General Franco's fascist forces with the allies mainly the conservative groups such as wealthy classes, the Roman Catholic Church fighting to overthrow the Republican government.  On the other hand were the Republicans comprised of various groups including socialists, communists, trade unions, liberal democrats, anarchists and secularists. Orwell was exposed to all the horrors of war and almost got killed himself. His insight into the brutal Spanish Civil War is very enlightening, as he describes the sad story, sometimes in a humorous way. He brings to life the privations and squalor that soldiers in the front line had to endure. The human toll from this terrible war was staggering, running into hundreds of thousands of killed, largely as a result of callous mass executions.<br /><br />In the book, Orwell gives a vivid and eloquent description of the time he was fighting in the militia which provides an eyewitness account of the fighting. Orwell explains how the fascists managed to prevail against the Socialist Republicans. Among the reasons were the Communists and Anarchists who often fought fiercely against each other. The betrayal by the pro-Stalin Communists, with USSR machinations during the war being more focused on furthering the Soviet Foreign policy than the communists cause. In other words, the communists were as deceitful and insincere as the fascists. From these experiences, Orwell detested USSR style of communism, which he depicted in his famous satire \\"The Animal Farm\\" as well as in \\"1984\\". I now have a different perspective of the politics of this war.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, depressing and at times hilarious book. It provides the reader with a more balanced account of the fighting during that dark period of Spain's history. This is recommended reading for those who like war stories, the history of Spain or just good writing.as well as in \\"1984\\".

B000E5KJEI|4.0|I'm not sure how I ever missed seeing this movie until now.  The plot was mostly entertaining, although I teetered on boredome a few times.  The cast and acting was solid (Eastwood and Freeman are a great team and Hackman is one of my favorite actors.)  However, Clint's gravelly, monotone deliver got a little tedious at times.  The HD DVD transfer doesn't have the greatest picture quality as compared to some other releases, but it is still beautiful.  While this was not my favorite Eastwood western (I liked Pale Rider better) it is worth at least a rental.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Sometimes when someone has asked me, \\"What movie did you see last night?\\" I've had to stop and think a moment before I could even remember what movie I'd seen. They're all alike, or remade, or just generic mannequins doing predictable things, so that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart.     Not so with V for Vendetta: you won't forget what you've seen!     Its chief resemblance to the book is that both are flawed, not perfect by any means -- but there is so much more to love than to lament! Both entertain, provoke, and haunt you with home truths, both move to laughter and to tears, and leave scenes replaying in your imagination.     The movie was wonderfully faithful to the book, not in every detail, but more than faithful in spirit. The graphic novel had many subplots, which filled out the story but at times almost detracted, or at least distracted, from the key ideas. A movie, of necessity, must pare things down a bit, but in this case it was like chipping away excess to reveal the facets and true colors at the heart of a gem.     What remains is a haunting melody about the human spirit: we do mess things up badly, but even greater is our propensity to overcome and be transformed. The movie added focus to the ways V adapted to unthinkable torment, and the way Evey (and the woman letter-writer) discovered in the worst of times that our \\"last inch\\" of integrity is really our only treasure.     * The movie highlighted the way the human spirit responds to horror and brutality--to survive, surmount, and transcend, becoming more than we were before. V rescued and preserved the best of the human spirit -- not just in the art and music and books he treasured, but also in himself. He could have become a monster, but it was his love--for humanity, for beauty, for humor, for integrity--that kept him from the edge.     * The movie also emphasized that ideas are powerful instruments of change, and ideas can't be killed. If change is to be accomplished, it cannot be by the will of one man (like the despotic Chancellor), but must truly reflect the will of the governed. (The deployment of the Fed-Ex packages, for instance.) ;)     I heard that Moore had at first withdrawn, but had a change of heart about the film--I hope that's true because, as the creator who wrote the above points across so many minds and hearts, he should be thrilled and proud.     My deep gratitude to both Moore and the briliant creators of this film. I can't wait to get my copy!
B000AADYUI|5.0|The original Jefferson Starship album of 1970 with a lineup that includes members of Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna, The Grateful Dead, and Crosby Stills and Nash as one expanded group of musicians (of course, there was always some crossover anyway), BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE is a concept album that breaks new ground in its presentation as a musical science fiction novel on vinyl (now CD), and a Hugo Award nominee for best sci-fi story.<br /><br />Paul Kantner transmutes the scornful separatism of the antiwar movement and the drug culture into an epic of planetary exodus in which spirituality, psychic phenomena and Eastern philosophies are wedded to Western technology in a seamless, life-affirming whole of discovery and renaissance.<br /><br />In this troubled era, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE has regained its relevance. There is always the future. There is always hope. Kantner and Co.'s master plan, to hijack the starship, is really a clarion call to retake our own destinies on planet Earth: \\"Dear Brumus, the ship will be ours and you have to roll with it...and though your master's head's blown off you'll have to go with it...\\"<br /><br />The original sound quality of the album though layered and textured, was merely average but has been much improved on the remastered reissue. The extra tracks are studio outtakes and alternate versions of the songs that make up this album, and although it is interesting to see how BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE evolved, on the other hand it's an unnecessary frippery.<br /><br />A very untraditional album, BLOWS AGAINST THE EMPIRE \\"will carry you well past Gideon, and the people you see will leave you be, more than the ones you've known before.\\"
1401201911|4.0|\\"What was the point of Lex Luthor. A human being who dared to challenge a God.\\"<br />Superman, Red Son<br /><br />This statement by Superman pretty much sums up the relationship between Superman and Lex Luthor except that in a weird twist the God is the hero and the man the villain. `Red Son' turns the dynamic 180 degrees into its more natural state. Baby Kal-L lands in a Soviet Union farming collective rather than Kansas and becomes the standard bearer of Stalin's Communist vision. Thanks to the sheer might of Superman the Soviet Union is able to rise up while the United States (and Chile??) are left isolated and in disarray.<br /><br />This is a very deep story that cuts to the core of Superman in a way that canonized stories cannot. Essentially Superman becomes a metaphor for an all intrusive government. Benjamin Franklin once said, \\"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety\\". The question of liberty vs security is more important today than ever before with many Americans jumping to give up civil rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights to feel a little safer. Should we submit to random searches, warrentless wiretapping, suspension of habeas corpus, automated traffic cameras? Superman is a reflection of increasingly sophisticated technology that monitors and dehumanizes us all. In America, Luthor is as obsessed with destroying Superman as he is in the canonized version except this time his goal is more reasonable (regardless of his despicable personality).<br /><br />The Soviet Superman is never meant to be evil just overprotective and stifling. Unfortunately the author chose to absolve the alternate Superman of most of his crimes by blaming them on outside manipulations reducing the impact of the story. I also have to question the ending lesson. After Luthor is successful in wresting control of the world's destiny from Superman he takes a similar path of top down social engineering called Luthorism with even better quantifiable results than those attained by Superman including a life expectancy that went from 120 years to an astounding 180 years. The point of the story seemed to be that Superman's good intentions were oppressive because they dehumanized man but in the end the book seemed to imply that Luthor was better because he could put up superior statistics.thorism with even better quantifiable results than those attained by Superman including a life expectancy that went from 120 years to an astounding 180 years.

B000AMU0QC|5.0|Only time will tell if Sufjan Stevens manages to churn out enough albums for all fifty states. Since 2003, he's covered only two of the states. Maybe he can combine some state names...<br /><br />But whether or not he covers the whole USA, Stevens' will keep charming people with his music, as he does in his latest album \\"Illinoise.\\" And no, that is not a typo. It's sort of folk -- dreamy acoustic pop, with songs about aliens, God, and wacky interludes. This is folk music for the Wes Anderson fans.<br /><br />It opens with a dreamy intro about a UFO, written in elusive language that could hint at either aliens or a religious vision. Your pick which it is, but Stevens' sweet voice and birdlike instruments make it sound ethereal... before it switches over into the choral singing and inspiring horns of \\"Black Hawk War.\\" By the time it's over, you'll feel like saluting.<br /><br />Stevens uses that as a springboard for lighter material -- inspiring rock anthems, mellow acoustic music, and vaguely ominous balladry. Some of the songs wouldn't be out of place at a down-home barn dance, and others are sparkling indie bliss. And yes, some songs dabble at both styles, like the sweeping dancey \\"Man of Metropolis.\\"<br /><br />By the last stretch of the album, Stevens switches over to a folk-dreampop style, with cute little interludes between the songs. \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!!\\" wins for most unique title, but it also shows Stevens off in his eerie folk best. It's a sound that continues its melancholy way, right to the end -- the sparkling \\"Out of Egypt.\\"<br /><br />Yep, \\"Illinoise\\" is one of those albums that qualifies as an experience -- it's the sort of music that transports you away, and doesn't set you back down until it ends. Though it borders on maudlin in places, Stevens' songcraft and musical skill are enough to make every song on this album a treasure.<br /><br />Stevens has your basic folk voice, but he uses it with such sweetness and smoothness that he sounds amazing. Sometimes he just sings as is, and sometimes he lets the chorus of backing vocals swell up behind him, singing harmony to every line. And then there's the music, which adds further harmony to his vocals. Ah yes, the music. It's a colourful patchwork of basic folk -- acoustic guitar, drums, bells, horns, piano and what sounds like a xylophone. It's bright in some places, dismal in others.<br /><br />And it's full of Stevens' bittersweet lyrics, where he manages to make us pity a serial killer, mourn a city's passing, and wonder what those lights in the sky are. He has a definite way with words (\\"i can't explain the state that I'm in/the state of my heart... he was my best friend\\").

B00005JOVH|4.0|I liked the first 2 movies in the series, and this one competently carries the franchise forward.  Many of the same guys return for a final fight to preserve mutants from extinction.  The addition of the Beast played by Kelsey Grammer was a nice addition as well.  The plot moves along nicely and is not overwhelming with action.  My biggest complaint was there was not a good villian or foil for Wolverine.  In the first movie he had Sabertooth and in the second he had Deathstrike and Mystique.  In this one he deals a bit with Juggernaut, but I would have liked to see more Wolverine humor.  Regardless, it is well worth seeing.
B000E97HIA|5.0|This review isn't so much about the 3121, (although it is a great cd) but about the amazon.com reviewer's comments. I wanted to emphasize what the previous reviewer said because I too found the amazon.com reviewer's a bit out of line. <br />My one comment is how can Prince be the 'black Beck' if he was an artist before Beck was? Not only that, but Prince is a legendary artist and no offense but I don't think when we look back on pop culture in hundreds of years people will be holding Beck to the same level as Prince.
B0000067L2|5.0|The album cover, one of the best examples of mid-60s psychedelia, and the quirky title, are only two relatively minor examples of why Cream's second album acheived and maintained the status of a classic.<br /><br />The fact is that Messrs. Clapton, Bruce, and Baker found Cream's true voice on DISRAELI GEARS. As tight as any band could be, when they are not trying to replicate an aural hallucination they are laying down electrified jazz riffs and blues themes, more and better.<br /><br />Totally in control at all times, from the opener \\"Strange Brew,\\" the archetypal opening riff of \\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" and the odd lyric poem of \\"SWLABR\\" aka \\"She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow\\" Cream proves they can rock harder than almost any band ever has.<br /><br />\\"World of Pain\\" and \\"Dance The Night Away\\" are guitar-stretching numbers that prove once and for all that God, er, Eric Clapton knows his way around a fretboard.<br /><br />\\"Blue Condition,\\" \\"Take It Back,\\" \\"We're Going Wrong,\\" and the cover \\"Outside Woman Blues\\" are, as their names imply, solid blues pieces that establish the band's comfort level in that genre.<br /><br />Probably the all-around best acid rock song on the album is \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses,\\" Homer's The Odyssey redux with it's image-laden lyric wedded to a driving, screaming beat.<br /><br />\\"Mother's Lament\\" is a Cockney drinking song that closes DISRAELI GEARS on an up note.<br /><br />The underpinning of each song on the album explores the band's heavily jazz-influenced style. DISRAELI GEARS is neither hard rock nor blues nor jazz. It is an examination of rock music as art, and can well be considered the first Fusion album presaging bands such as Weather Report and Special Efx.<br /><br />Yet another album that came out of that year of nexus 1967, DISRAELI GEARS more than stands the test of time.

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel HAPPY and start dancing around the room to a little of Bruce's Best music.

Every now and then a synthesizer part will \\"bust- loose\\" and catch your attention, but for the most part the music here drifts in the back of your consciousness and is quite relaxing. This is actually quite uncarachteristic of Porcupine Tree music which commands strict attention (not that that's a bad thing!) Chris Maitland's drumming on here is exquisite (as always!) Love the fretless bass of Colin Edwin and Steven's Keys and guitar parts soar at times. Miss Richard, though ,and his mellotron on some of these tracks! I wouldn't consider this \\"essential\\" but to me, a die- hard fan, I am glad that I own it.
B00005JOYA|1.0|We even drove to Luxembourg ( Utopolis ) to see this garbage! I was hoping all the main actors/actresses were killed.  Makes no sense whatsoever and the dialouge was just terrible.  Do not see this movie. Its all sound effects but thats about it. SUCKS BIG TIME!!
B0000BWVCM|4.0|After seeing X-Men 3: The Last Stand, I can confidently say that this is the best X-Men movie of the trilogy. X-Men 1 was charged with introducing all of the characters, which limited the type of story that could be effectively told. X3, on the other hand, focussed very little on character development and was more about action. X2, then, is the perfect balance of style and substance. While it does not necessarily have as many complex action sequences as the third, it also is not limited in the way that the first movie was. That said, X2 is an enjoyable action flick that does not sacrifice good storytelling for action sequences. The characters are well thought-out and more developed than in the other two movies, and the story is probably the best of the three. This movie is not for everyone, but even casual fans of the X-Men comics or those who are interested in learning more about the stories should check this movie out. For the most part, it can stand on its own, and requires little existing knowledge about the X-Men universe, although those who know more about the comics will be able to appreciate this movie on a deeper level and pick up on things that others might just gloss over (such as the hint of Jean's emergence as Phoenix at the end).
B00005JMFQ|2.0|This film is an overly-sentimental, messy, cynical exploitation of the popular \\"contemporary British(esque) love story\\" complete with easy listening high tempo FM style soundtrack (I suspect the songs were selected first and the script written around them), attractive high profile cast and lots of romantic swelling-music types of scenes.<br /><br />In fact, that is the problem.  Rather than telling us one love story the film gets greedy and tries to tell a dozen, essentially eliminating the build up in each individual story and simply racing towards its climactic clincher(s).  We never get to know any of the characters very well (exceptions Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, and even then it is because of what the actors bring to their parts rather than what is written), we never get to care about any of the stories.<br /><br />Another problem is the men.  They are uniformly soppy.  Hugh Grant has only ever played one good part - About a Boy - and in this film he plays the usual soppy, weak Hugh Grant style of man.  Only now we are expected to believe him as the UK Prime Minister!  Colin Firth also displays his willingness to be typecast as the next Hugh Grant, but the real shocker is sexy Andrew Lincoln also being reduced to a soppy mess.  Is this really the sort of man that women swoon over?<br /><br />The story.  Well, there are just too many of them.  This film is not Nashville or Grand Hotel but it thinks it is.  Far too many characters vaguely and uninterestingly linked together makes a mess. Sometimes more star power is just more stars.<br /><br />The cast are, sadly, excellent (sadly because they are mostly wasted).  Why Laura Linney got involved in this is anyone's guess.  Bill Nighy is funny but verges on absurd.  Only Emma Thompson has a chance to actually act, and to be fair it is a killer scene - the Joni Mitchell scene - proving what a very clever actor can do with very little material.  Subtle, moving, beautiful.<br /><br />One scene does not make a film.  The songs are good, the actors good (and pretty - boys and girls), but the film is overall a  disappointment.<br /><br />Did anyone actually think that scene of the boy running through the airport was good, really?<br /><br />Still, if you enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun or Notting Hill (ie if you do not demand much from your films) you'll probably like this.(and pretty - boys and girls), but the film is overall a  disappointment.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is definitely the 2nd best album of 2005! The Mars Volta are a mix of prog-rock and punk. The lead singer kind of has a strange but interesting voice.<br /><br />CYGNUS...VISMUND CYGNUS: 10/10: The opening track, sounds like a deathmetal band going slowly insane.<br /><br />THE WIDOW: 10/10: You'll definetly love this song.<br /><br />L'VIA L'VIAQUEZ: 10/10: A classic song.<br /><br />MIRANDA THAT GHOST JUST ISN'T HOLY ANYMORE: 10/10: A very good song, another one split into many parts.<br /><br />CASSANDRA GEMENI: 100/10: a 33-minute song, probably the best on the album. Split into 5 parts, This feels like 5 songs in one.<br /><br />So if you love rock, then buy this CD.
B0002OERI0|3.0|When this album came out, many older Green Day fans bashed them for becoming poser. I bashed them, myself. But when you look at it, it seems to be a re-run of the Dookie era. Band gets big, old fans get mad, shun them, band gets new fans. And, we can all say that Dookie, while not GD's best, is a good album, and it isn't poser.  <br />So, will this be the same? In truth, looking at AI the first time, it seems poser.Heck, looking at it for the hunderth time, it still seems poser. Unless you consider that maybe, they just wanted to say what they thought, release what they thought was a good album, and they had the bad luck to have a couple of tracks loved by seven-yr olds. In that case, it would be punk, because what is punk but a life-style based on freedom?  <br />AI isn't the worst album ever. JOS, Homecoming, and St. Jimmy save it. And while I agree that Boulevard is a poser song, a lot of GD's albums had one or two poser songs on them, except for Insomniac. No one really cared, because a lot of punk albums have them, until one poser song became famous. Then it mattered, big-time.  <br />Green Day's American Idiot is punk-poser, in my opinion. They're on the brink of becoming posers, but they can stop it. And, before you confine Green Day to the world of posers with Blink-182 and Sum 41, remember that a concept album doesn't make a group poser. Bad Religion albums are all concept, and no one can all them poser. They just didn't make it big. In truth, AI reminds of The Empire Strikes First, which is not a poser album. No matter how many times Mtv plays a music video, doesn't make it poser.  <br />With that said, Green Day aren't fully posers. A bit, but not fully. And maybe, in ten years, all of who called AI poser will look back on it, just as the ones who called Dookie poser look back on it, and admit that it was, actually, a punk album.  <br />
1400079276|3.0|This is an odd volume.  I'm not sure what else to say given the fact that the opening pages dwell on a mysterious incident that occurred to a group of students in Japan during World War II, but the subsequent 400 pages never get around to explaining the reason behind that event.  If the definition of \\"post-modern novel\\" means that the author is free to write about anything that strikes his or her fancy -- such as talking cats, overlapping worlds, long, black, snake-like objects coming out of dead people's mouths -- without feeling the compunction to explain why, than I may need to run screaming back to the Dickens and Hardy section of the library immediately.  I fully appreciated Murakami's scene-setting capabilities.  There were several pages that read beautifully.  I was fully engaged within individual chapters and sections of the book.  But as an entity, this novel suffered from the lack of anything that may have resembled a motive or a sense of closure.
B000AWYOGE|1.0|Don't watch this.  It was stupid.  I sat through the whole movie, don't know why, but I wish someone would have warned me how dumb it was going to be.  Bad movie, decent acting, horrible story, even worse ending.
B0009IW88A|4.0|I made the mistake of comparing this score to Danny Elfman's operatic music for the original movie - which turned out to be a big mistake. The soundtracks I find easiest to listen to are those with distinct and obvious themes which I can easily discern. The obvious examples being Superman, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. This is not the case with Batman Begins. It's much easier to see the film first in order to appreciate the music. Once I did, I began to truly enjoy the music for what it was, rather than trying to impose my own expectations upon it.  <br /> <br />There are very very few action pieces in this soundtrack. The rare exceptions being Myotis (starting from 1:52 mins), Antrozous and Molossus. Apart from that they're all \\"mood pieces\\" (for want of a better term). So if you're looking for high-octane action themes ala' Zimmer's Gladiator score, it's best to look elsewhere.  <br /> <br />Overall, I don't think it reaches the heights of excellent of the \\"Original\\" Danny Elfman soundtrack. But it's still makes for an excellent listening experience, providing you can put aside your won expectations and appreciate it for what it really is.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Underworld is similar to a Shakespear tragedy (murder, lust, betrayal).  I won't give anything away, but you should really see this movie.  The fact that they run around with guns may seem hokey at first, but once you see the whole story you'll appreciate it a lot more.
B000286RNY|5.0|One in a long list of films that have been butchered by Miramax in an effort to make Hong Kong films more palatable, SHAOLIN SOCCER suffered doubly due to shifting release dates (it was pushed back for over a year and a half).  In its native country, SHAOLIN SOCCER was one of the most successful films and for good reason.  It takes the typical \\"ragtag underdogs teaming up to fight against insurmountable odds\\" adding Shaolin kung fu and special effects to the mix for a perfect combination.<br /><br />  When the formerly formidable soccer star Golden Leg Fung (Man Tat Ng)--now a limping lackey thanks to his teammate Hung (Patrick Tse)--loses his job, he hopes to start his own soccer team.  He happens upon Sing (Stephen Chow), a cleaner who has been charged by his former master with spreading the techniques of Shaolin kung fu.  Sing has been searching for a way to repackage Shaolin in a new, exciting, and socially viable form.  It takes a bit but Sing finally realizes that his \\"Iron Leg\\" technique would be a perfect fit in Golden Leg's dream soccer team.<br /><br />  Golden Leg and Iron Leg set out to convince Sing's five other brothers to join in their venture.  They discover that Iron Head (Yut Fei Wong), Empty Hand (Kwok Kuen Chan), Weight Vest (Lam Chi Chung), Hooking Leg (Chi-Sing Lam), and Iron Shirt (Kai Man Tin) have let their confidence and skills lapse.  Can they regain the spirit from their idealistic days of youth?  You better believe it!  After some hilarious training sequences, the brothers come together as a team and begin to make their way through the ranks of the soccer championships until their showdown with Hung's appropriately named \\"Evil Team.\\"<br /><br />  Along the way, Sing meets Mui (Vicki Zhao), a master of Tai Chi and bread making.  When the two meet, Sing's infectious optimism and singing create chaos in the streets and results in a dance sequence highly inspired by Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" video.  This moment is typical of the uproarious tone of Chow's film.  As much as it took from other \\"losers banding together\\" films like THE BAD NEWS BEARS, REVENGE OF THE NERDS, and THE REPLACEMENTS, Chow's film helped pave the way for other Asian \\"extreme sport\\" films such as Fumihiko Sori's PING PONG and Yudai Yamaguchi's BATTLEFIELD BASEBALL.<br /><br />  A word of warning: in all, nearly twenty-two minutes of the film were eliminated for the long-delayed, limited US release.  Things missing include the backstory between Fung and Hung.  Avoid this version at all costs.  Region free NTSC versions with English subtitles are readily available via innumerable web vendors.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|OMG I loved the original King Kong....it was phenomonal.  So, I thought that a bigger and better version would be cool, something interesting to watch, even though I was iffy about Jack Black playing the director.  I doubted him.  I shouldn't have.  I loved, loved, LOVED this movie.  The fact that they took the time to make Kong an actual character in the movie, with emotions and fears and heroism....wow.  I have been trying to finish the movie, but (spoiler) knowing that he dies in the end so far away from where he was from without understanding the why of it all...I can't do it.  What can I say, I have a big place in my heart for animals. <br /> <br />But truthfully, the monkey (Gorilla?  Ape?) made this movie.  I made it to the part where the two of them (the woman and Kong) were sliding on the ice, and lost it.  The missle came down and blew into the lake, and the rage and fear that I saw in his face...I turned it off.  But, I can honestly say that it was extremely well done. <br /> <br />The special effects in the movie were amazing, the bugs almost looked real as did the dinosaurs (what can I say, we know they weren't, right???).  The natives scared me.  And, the love story wasn't cheesy.  I enjoyed what I could make it through.   <br /> <br />Watch this one.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This trilogy addition highlights a major step in science fiction movie production.  George Lucas's genius vision has allowed all of us to experience the rich and wonderful ideas that only a true visionary could have originated.  A genius is defined as someone who changes the course of human history and culture, and George Lucas does exactly that.  Unfortunately, George Lucas's vision was not able to be completely fulfilled due to lack of technology when the originals were first created.  He always felt his movies needed the finishing touch that CGI allows, and I think it's amazing how he has incorporated that into his movies.   <br /> <br />Star Wars is meant to bring out the inner child in all of us, and I'm sure that George Lucas felt that that feeling was tampered with when the plot was changed so that Han Solo shot a concenrated beam of light through Greedo's head, unprovoked.  Adding the initial Greedo shot gives a need for Han Solo to defend himself, and makes his character seem more virtuous. <br /> <br />Lucas meant for his movies to be timeless, and not brutally criticized for the newly added special effects.  When you think about it, plot and character developement are what makes or breaks a movie.  They are the two main factors that make Star Wars a cultural icon. The special effects also play a lesser, but still important role.  Lucas propelled special effects to their max, in the originals, but they never reached the complexity he wished.  With the new tools now available to him, he was able to put in the intricacies and detail that he always envisioned.  The older critics need to get over their obsession with the original versions of star wars, because they are not Lucas's initial vision.  They are merely a \\"rough draft\\" eclipsed by the special editions now available. <br /> <br />I'm sorry that the original generation of Star Wars fans were not able to experience CGI initially.  They need to allow the new generation of Star Wars fans to fully enjoy Lucas's full vision.
B000AL730O|4.0|This cd is very good. It sounds like great old Mccartney - back to Mccartney I or Ram and even some hints at Beatles. But so what? It's 2006 and that was almost 40(!)years ago. \\"Driving Rain\\" sounded like great new Mccartney and playing with his band brought a fresh energy. I think the producer went absolutely the wrong direction having Mccartney play all the instruments himself and I'd rather see him back in the studio with his band.
B000BBYMA2|5.0|The 61st film of 70-year old director Kinji Fukasaku, BATTLE ROYALE begins with a prologue:<br /><br />  \\"At the dawn of the millennium the nation collapsed.  At 15% unemployment, 10 million were out of work.  800,000 students boycotted school.  The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act AKA the BR Act.\\"<br /><br />  While the logic of instating the BR Act due to the downturn of the Japanese economy is tenuous at best, BATTLE ROYALE screams into action and doesn't allow time to ponder such issues.  After a few scenes setting up core characters--Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and Noriko (Aki Maeda)--the forty-two high schoolers become trapped on a remote island where they're reintroduced to their seventh grade teacher, Kitano (brilliantly played by \\"Beat\\" Takeshi Kitano).<br /><br />  \\"This country's become no good,\\" Kitano says.  \\"The bigwigs got together and passed [the BR Act].  So today's lesson is... you kill each other off.  `Till there's only one left.  There's nothing against the rules.\\"<br /><br />  Armed with a random \\"weapon\\" (some get semi-automatic guns, some get less lethal implements like cookwear), each student has three days to dispatch his or her classmates in hope of being the last one standing.  Again, there is little time for logic and no room for pacifism. Playing like a high-stakes version of Martin Campbell's island prison adventure NO ESCAPE, BATTLE ROYALE finds fuel in the heightened melodrama of adolescence.  As these kids struggle to stay alive, classroom rivalries skyrocket and doe-eyed crushes become heavyweight love affairs.<br /><br />  Shuya, whose father abandoned him by taking his own life, becomes the stand-in for the audience as well as the prototypical Japanese.  Struggling in this microcosm of Japan, Shuya is a young man without a father as Japan is a country without a strong leader.  Meanwhile, the only male role model for Shuya appears to be Kitano, the slump-shouldered former teacher plagued with family problems of his own.<br /><br />  BATTLE ROYALE has its moments of \\"score-keeping\\" via graphics that appear, tallying the names of those who have died as well as how many students are left.  As the body count goes higher, director Fukasaku keeps raising the stakes, never relenting in this dogged contest.  Cleverly, BATTLE ROYALE doesn't appear as an outright parody.  Rather, it takes melodrama to the nth degree.  The film's score booms with emotionally riveting classical pieces, giving the proceedings an operatic tinge.Kitano, the slump-shouldered former teacher plagued with family problems of his own. <br /> <br />     BATTLE ROYALE has its moments of \\"score-keeping\\" via graphics that appear, tallying the names of those who have died as well as how many students are left.

B000E97Y6A|2.0|Sorry, but this was a big disappointment... I had to split the viewing over too evenings to even get through it. The special effects are cool but the acting is over-done, the film is too long (said by someone who usually hesitates to buy a film that's under two hours) and several overly long and sentimental scenes and the music just kills whatever suspense they manage to build up. I couldn't wait for the anticipated fall of the ape so I could go to bed and read a good book instead.

B00000099Y|5.0|The band Tool is know for their dark and myterious approach to music. The album Aenima (1996) to me is one of the greatest albums of all time. The music is dark and mythodical, yet the bridges in the songs are melodic and flowing. Maynard James Keenan ability to sing during the offbeat sequences of the songs is amazing. The song \\"Anema\\" is such a lyrical mastermind. A song about how fake and materialistic the people in California are. The song faces the issue of California eventually having the big quake and drifting form the continet. lyrics like \\" learn to swim, see you in Arizona Bay\\". Genius I say. Compared with the song \\"46 and 2\\" which addresses the Jungian psychology and evolution. with a lyric in the song \\"46 and 2 ahead of me\\" which deals with a higer evolved being than we are now. To me the lyrics are pure geniuos. They deal with complex thoughts and issues instead of the just everyday mundane sex, drugs and rock-n-roll, that the majority of bands sing about. A band maybe to complex and heavy for most, however if you just sit and listen to the lyrics and the arrangement of the songs you will be amazed. Definatly a thinking persons kind of music,,as well as tremendous muscians. The drumming of Danny Carey can be put on a pedistal with the likes of Neil Pert and Kieth Moon. As well as the melodic approach to the guitars and bass riffs. Truly a unique sound in American music.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|A sucky job, an uptight flat mate, an overbearing step-dad, and a row with your girlfriend; can a town full of zombies really make things much worse?  Starring Simon Pegg as Shaun and Nick Frost as his mate Ed, SHAUN takes the piss out of zombie movies with its referential dialogue and many scenes of having fun with the recently resurrected (such as trying to take them out with Shaun's prized record collection).<br /><br />  SHAUN follows the typical zombie structure with its group of mismatched survivors constantly seeking safety from the flesh eating former folks.  Completely unprepared for the walking dead, our heroes use an assortment of shovels, cricket bats, and other blunt objects to fend off the zombie menace.  Apparently they never read Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide!  Favorite scenes include Ed and Shaun doing a sing-along of Grandmaster Flash's \\"White Lines\\" with an undead chap and the remarkably choreographed bashing of a zombie all set to Queen's \\"Don't Stop Me Now.\\"  Funny stuff.
B000000132|5.0|This is the penultimate album from this ever-changing group of British musicians. Probably the most successful ensemble responsible for what I would consider as the best of the groups recording output in their brief history. This particular albums' (it was originally produced on vinyl) release was timed to be synced with their US Tour in 1974. Synonymous with the confusing musical direction of the times, their tour was the platform by which the launch of two notable seventies groups occurred; Kiss and 10cc. If there was ever a more divergent touring group, this was probably it. Interwoven strains of classically influenced music, tempered by harmonies and balance arranged by a carefully orchestrated rock ensemble which included traditional piano and contemporary synthesizer among others. All of this classical influence punctuated by lyrics that represent the very essence of the self-discovery of the times all done with a trace of nostalgic longing. This can be best heard in such tunes as \\"Running Hard,\\" I Think of You,\\" \\"Black Flame,\\" and \\"Mother Russia.\\" A delicate and intricate overlaying of vocal harmonies is also noteworthy in a number of compositions such as \\"Running Hard,\\" and \\"Black Flame.\\" I would consider this the one \\"must-have\\" recording to obtain out of their complete discography. Although, highly touted as another milestone recording from the group the album; \\"Sheherazade,\\" was a dismal disappointment to me. If you only want to get one Renaissance recording to sample the best of their work, \\"Turn of The Cards,\\" would be the obvious choice.

B00009W0U4|1.0|A film whose timeline has been altered always begs the question as to how effective the work would be if it were linear.  Would Christopher Nolan's MOMENTO have been more than a blip on the cinematic radar?  How about Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION?  The same should be asked about Gaspar Noe's lurid rape/revenge film, IRREVERSIBLE.<br /><br />  The plot (from end to beginning) is rather simplistic.  Alex (Monica Bellucci) is in love with Marcus (Vincent Cassel).  For some unknown reason the couple continue to hang out with her wet blanket ex-, Pierre (Albert Dupontel).  The trio attends a party after which Alex is sadistically sodomized by La Tenia (Jo Prestia).  After seeing Alex's beaten body, Marcus (now highly coked up) and Pierre are approached by two hooligans who promise to aid in their search for justice.  The quartet questions some prostitutes before learning the whereabouts of La Tenia (whose name translates as \\"the tapeworm\\").  With Pierre in tow, Marcus heads to The Rectum, a seedy gay bar, where he hopes to exact vengeance.<br /><br />  If it weren't for the reverse-order timeline and two scenes of intense brutality this film wouldn't have merited notice.  As it stands, however, IRREVERSIBLE isn't much more than an art house exploitation film.  Some may say that it's a treatise on voyeurism and that audiences will feel themselves compelled to watch even when they know that every scene could be more disturbing than the last.  Others will posit that Noe brings determinism to the fore with his characters dreaming about \\"future\\" events and eerily foreshadowing their fates.  Yet, while I enjoyed the nauseating camerawork and the lack of temporal touchstones, I found that the film was only compelling when it delved into the disgusting.<br /><br />  As Skizz Cyzyk says about Chrisopher Nolan's FOLLOWING, \\"I liked it until the beginning.\\"  Likewise, IRREVERSIBLE kept me squirming in my seat until the film came out of the underground and into the light.  I had no connection with any of the characters and the supposedly \\"shocking revelation\\" that the future victim Alex is pregnant with Marcus' child did nothing but compel me to roll my eyes.  It's as if Noe were trying to make Alex's never ending attack even worse.<br /><br />  Pretentious and grotesque, IRREVERSIBLE is a cinematic kick in the crotch.no connection with any of the characters and the supposedly \\"shocking revelation\\" that the future victim Alex is pregnant with Marcus' child did nothing but compel me to roll my eyes.

B0007939NO|5.0|I wonder why the beautiful Lerner-Loewe meoldies and lyrics and the movie itself are not more popular than they are - I'll go home with Bonnie Jean, The heather on the Hill, Almost like being in love. The movie itself is a serious production, meticulous in costumes, design and choreography.    This is a fairy tale, almost a charming ghost story, which is so unreal that it only happens in old places like the Scottish highland. Something beautiful that emerges beneath the fog only once in a while.    The story is also rich in Scottish culture - bagpipes, kilts, market place and folklore.    I also wonder why Van Johnson, with a big build and yet such a nimble tap dancer, did not have more dancing roles in other movies. And Cyd Charisse ballet dancing is simply an eye candy.     The melodies are so sweet and chorus so pure that the movie is worth watching over and over again, even if it is only for the songs.
0062502182|4.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" is a story told with utmost simplicity meant to inspire as it entertains and the style follows along the lines of a fairy tale. Its central theme is that  we all have a role that we have come to fulfill,our \\"personal legend\\" and that recognizing it and following its path leads to happiness.    However we may agree with its premise, many have found inspiration in its pages. The novel promps us to look further and identify what it is that we want out of life, somewhat along the lines of a quest or a pilgrimage. We glean from the story that for some the outcome brings fulfillment, and yet for others the gain is found in the process and the journey becomes the goal.

Now, he thinks and sits a lot, rarely acts and seems to be reaching his end as an action hero.    I have read all the books in the series and have watched Jack Reacher evolve from a hard-edged, no-nonsense seemingly amoral avenging and revenging angel into a character who is now developing into a \\"thinking\\" machine with feelings.    He is described in The Hard Way as being without the conscience gene; yet he is doing what he does for Kate and Jade...a show of conscience and a contradiction.    The trademark action is gone, except for a predictable ending that occurs in relatively few pages.      Jack Reacher may have overreached his need to be.  Now, his publisher is reaching for a new, less action-oriented  incarnation of a once powerful hero.  Has the twenty-first century hit Reacher?  Is he now becoming a \\"sensitive\\" action hero?  I hope not.
B000002LGA|4.0|What is it like, listening to Lou Reed's tribute to a self destructive New York of the 1980s, almost twenty years after the fact?  Reed's 1989 'come back' album, after a particularly abysmal \\"Mistrial\\", is considered one of his very best.  But it is such a topical album, all about Crack-dealing gangsters (Romeo Had Juliet), poor immigrants (Dirty Blvd), AIDS victims (Halloween Parade), and the death of Andy Warhol (Dime Store Mystery).  Who remembers Jesse Jackson nowadays?   <br /> <br />Perhaps surprisingly, Reed's New York sounds as good as ever, even if the age of which Reed sings about seems, in retrospect, like a long lost Golden Era - New York before 9/11, before the Patriot Acts, before two US wars in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.   <br /> <br />I think Reed's vision of his favorite city still sounds so compelling, even now, because the urgency is very much there.  \\"There is No Time\\", a call for action if there ever was one, does not sound that different nowadays.  For Bob Dylan, the Times aren't a' changin' anymore; now Things Have Changed.  But Reed's anger is still with us \\"Xmas is still in February\\" for Reed's heroes, even after all this time. <br /> <br />Because \\"Halloween Parade\\" Is not just about AIDS;  It's Reed catching up with his \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" creatures and find them dying and suffering.  What was once gay, glamerous and sexy is now decaying and dying.  It's a song about Loss.  \\"Busload of Faith\\" is about a desperate, murderous world, and it rocks hard, too.  It's a Cynical Lou Reed, to be sure, \\"You can't depend on any Churches, unless there's some Real Estate you wanna buy\\", but it is direct, honest, and utterly devoid of false optimism. <br /> <br />Even when the lyrics are most dated, the music is vibrant.  Austrian politician Kurt Waldheim is two years shy of his hundredth birthday,  Jesse Jackson's \\"Common Ground\\" is pre much forgotten, and the PLO has managed to be a Pariah, a Partner, a Pariah again and now a mostly irrelevant organisation.  But Reed's song about them, \\"Good Evening Mr. Waldheim\\", is nonetheless great Pop-Rock, and this remains one of my favourite songs on the album.  Similarly, \\"Strawman\\", about a unlikely superhero, is not one of Reed's greatest lyrical achievements, but the opening riff, and the chorus hooks work wonders. <br /> <br />Given the strength of the material, I find it easy to overlook the weaker songs like \\"The Last Great American Whale\\" and \\"The Beginning of a Great Adventure\\".  The latter one is about parenthood;  The earlier one is about... I'm not quite sure.  Both are forgettable. <br /> <br />The best of Reed's New York, and the best of his overall output, is the opener and the third song.  \\"Romeo Had Juliet\\" has a trademark Lou Reed, simple and extremely  effective chord progression.  But more then that, it is Reed's poetry at its finest (with the possible exception of 'Heroin').  \\"Trapped between the twisted stars the plotted line the faulty map that brought Columbus to New York\\" is the perfect opening for the album, because it describes not only street-wise Romeo Rodrigez and his beloved Juliet, but also every character on this album, and, in a way, maybe all of Reed's works. <br /> <br />Even better is \\"Dirty Boulevard\\", Reed's tale of an abused immigrant Child in New York's worst neighborhoods.  Featuring arguably Reed's greatest chord progression since \\"Sweet Jane\\", it is a story of prostitution, abuse, death, and surprisingly, hope and escape.  When performed live, \\"Dirty Blvd\\" can be liberated from the confines of the dark song cycle and sparkle with optimism, even Joie d'Vivre. <br /> <br />And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming <br />he's found a book on magic in a garbage can <br />He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling <br />\\"At the count of 3,\\" he says, \\"I hope I can disappear\\" <br /> <br />And fly fly away, from this Dirty Boulevard <br />I wanna fly... away...    <br />
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Korn always manage to reinvent themselves with each record (Even \\"Take A Look...\\", as they fused their old school sound with new songwriting tendencies), and you have to applaud their will to experiment. They really went on a limb this time, and most of it works. With trends coming and going, it's hard for some fans to put old favorites' new albums into perspective. Supposed \\"Fans\\" that have moved on to the next trend will have a biased opinion no matter what Korn puts out. Korn have been around a long time, and to be doing something innovative at this stage of the game is truly remarkable. Undoubtedly the next album will see Korn perfecting the ideas presented on this album, while adding even more twists and turns. Even Jonathan's lyrics have started to evolve, as they are less direct and more abstract. This is totally new to Korn. I have learned to never count Korn out, even as I sat through albums I cringed at (though everyone else ate up Follow The Leader and Issues). The best artists will sometimes take on new challenges that displease some fans. This album has obviously done that, But I think it's a super effort, with hints at things to come.
0141301139|4.0|I *LOVED* this book as a kid and re-read it as an adult to preview it for my niece and nephew. I was a little surprised about the story I remembered and the story that *is*. It's honestly brutal about farm life (shooting the foxes) and fantastical all in the same breath - which is fun. The three human characters are almost exact caricatures of alcoholism, gluttony, etc.     Mr. Fox definitely isn't a role model in his stealing to survive...because it was his stealing that got him in the stitch he is now...but, the story is very very fun and moves fast. I still recommend it, but think that it also might be a great way for moms/dads to talk with their kids about right/wrong...especially after the part where Mr. Fox is confronted by one of the other animals about their stealing.     Still a great story and I still recommend it! I love the idea of a little underground village where all the little animals live in relative peace with no fear or threat and outsmarting the mean farmers (which is what I remember about the book from my childhood)!
0446677450|5.0|This book clearly helped me understand some important differences between how rich and poor people think about accumulating money.  This is important info if you are NOT rich!  By contrasting the difference between how his \\"poor dad\\"  his \\"rich dad\\" think, he exposes some of the reasons that sincere, hard-working, educated people are still struggling.  Nobody has all of the answers to acquiring and keeping wealth, but I think this book is an essential start. I bought an extra copy for my teenagers to facilitate discussion on money and weatlth.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I thought I was losing her to other artists like Britney, Mariah, Christina and Ashlee, but she's back.  She's really back (tears of joy).  The song \\"NO\\" alone is worth more than the cost of this album, but really, all of the songs are amazing.  I was there during the release of her Spanish albums \\"pies descalzos\\" and \\"donde estan los ladrones\\", and then I kind of disappeared, but I'm back.  This CD is truly, truly wonderful.  I love her, she's so smart, articulate, beautiful and so very talented.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Sahara, directed by Breck Eisner, is an action/adventure film about two treasure hunters, Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino (Steve Zahn). Al and Dirk travel to Mali to try to search for a lost Civil War battleship filled with treasure, but then they temporarily abandon their own quest and join Eva Rojas (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) to try to find the source of a deadly \\"plague\\" that's spreading across Africa.<br /><br /> If you think Sahara is another one of those predictable, clich&eacute;d action movies that we've seen too many of lately...you're right. Everyone loves to see a great action hero perform some cool, humanly impossible stunt, and it just wouldn't be an exciting enough ending if the main characters didn't overcome impossible odds to achieve their victory, but when this happens again and again and again...it's not even thrilling any more. \\"There's no way that should have worked, right?\\" remarks one of the characters near the end of the movie, but by that point I'd already thought the same thing myself countless times. Still, I do have to give the filmmakers some credit. The special effects are great, and at least a lot of the stunts are imaginative, though unrealistic. But there was one thing about the plot that really got on my nerves. Isn't it suspenseful enough to watch the heroes and heroine try to save the lives of all the people in Africa? Apparently not, since part way through the movie it's revealed that if the nuclear waste that's poisoning Mali's water supply isn't taken care of in a few days, it will destroy the entire world. No, I'm not joking, they really expect us to suspend our reality that much.<br /><br /> The three main characters in Sahara are formulaic for this type of movie. You've got the laid-back, overconfident action hero who has more luck than skill, the comic-relief, and the brave heroine who, despite her brains and resourcefulness, still needs the aforementioned action hero to rescue her from the bad guy's lair. McConaughey wasn't very believable in his role, often appearing way too calm, but Cruz did alright in comparison. At first, I was pleasantly surprised at the way the movie down-played the usually inevitable romance between the male and female lead, but that just made it seem out of place when they started kissing at the end. Uh, did I miss something? On the other hand, I was really impressed with Zahn. He had a lot of funny quotes, and his comedic timing was perfect! I wasn't the only person in the theater laughing out loud at lines that would have sounded lame if they'd been said by almost anyone else. If you ever decide to go on a perilous treasure hunt, Zahn's character, Al, is definitely the type of guy you want to take with you; he'll make the whole experience much more enjoyable.<br /><br /> Sahara is funnier and more imaginative than a typical action movie, but that doesn't change the fact that it is still just that: a typical action movie. But, since I doubt that too many original action/adventure movies will be coming out in the near future, if you're a fan of the genre you might want to settle for this.asn't very believable in his role, often appearing way too calm, but Cruz did alright in comparison.

0553801503|1.0|I was SO EXCITED for the release of this book after reading the others. I was listening to it on audio-book and 1/2 way through I phoned my partner-in-audio-book-reading who was just finishing the 1/2 half...and I asked -- is there ANY story line in this book? His answer was \\"no\\". I didn't bother with the second half of the book. Apparently the author adds a bit at the end explaining that it is really is just a way to introduce people...but it doesn't really tell us much about them. I'm skipping this one and will pick up the new charaters in the next book...don't feel like I'm missing anything here.
B000003TA4|5.0|I was 16 when it was released and I loved it then and I love it now. For me this is something I can listen to the whole way through without skipping songs.  I think the 12 songs on this CD have aged quite well and fit well in any rock fans collection.    I have read the last 300 reviews and many people don't know what they are talking about. I didn't realize how polarizing this album was.    Music shouldn't be about technical guitar prowess or a 5 octave vocal range or hair spray.  People shouldn't be caught up with genre labels like grunge, punk, emo, hair metal, nu-metal, alternative. Reviews of music shouldn't comment on the personal lives of the artist's drug use, death, or bizarre choice of mate.  You shouldn't even care about how tastes in fashion and music changed after this (and other \\"grunge\\" acts) came onto the scene.    It should be about the songs and how you relate to them personally.  If you don't like this that is fine, but the other superfluous [...]shouldn't be relevant in the discussion of the album, please feel free to get a MySpace account and [...]about it there.
1592402038|3.0|In the future you might want to check your mistakes before talking about another's hubris. Though you may presume \\"oral\\" has to do with hearing, the last time I checked, it has to do with your mouth, which you should keep closed, acording to your post, unless you have checked all your sources.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This is a good compentant caper flick.  Nicely written dialogue and easy performances make this a good film to watch.  Many people have said this version is flat when compared to the original, but it holds up well.  Like most caper flicks there are some plot holes, but are these movies being used as tutorial, or as entertainment.  Some nice plot twists along the way definitely makes this a recommend.
B000002C4J|5.0|Celine Dion's LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE album has become my favorite music of all time.  I originally bought the album for its famous theme song from Titanic \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" but the more I listened to the CD, the more I found myself always skipping over that song to get to the best song on the album, \\"To Love You More.\\"  This song grabs your attention with its instrumental opening that carries throughout the remainder of the song and exhibits Dion at more than her best.  Celine Dion uses her talented voice to stun, mystify and move you throughout the entire album.   <br /> <br />And let's not forget the duets with Barbara Streisand and Luciano Pavarotti.  \\"Tell Him\\" left me speechless when I first heard it. The voices of Streisand and Dion in this timeless love song pull you into the theme, as almost everyone has wanted to tell someone that they love them, but is hesitant for whatever reason.  With a famous voice like Pavarotti, Dion definitely added even more greatness to this wonderful, love filled album with their duet \\"I Hate You Then I Love You.\\"   <br /> <br />#3 on the album, \\"Treat her like a Lady\\" adds upbeat and kick to give the album a variety of rhythm and sound.  The entire CD of LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE reminds people of how important love is and how wonderful love can be.  It also shows off the unbeatable talent of Celine Dion who actually knows how to sing without shouting, which has become the fad of the day.   <br />
6305882592|5.0|I liked this movie more than I thought I did. It was hilarious and very sweet. Harold and Maude are indeed the most unique couple in film history. For all its humor and eccentricity, it still has a universal theme about love/happiness and life/death, purveying a one of a kind love story that doesn't come off as being unrealistic, didactic, overly sentimental, or strange. Great story, great film.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Ok, so I've just finished watching Underworld and I have to say, I love it! And after reading some of the reviews, I'm a little perplexed...<br /><br />Don't people know that this is an attempt to get away from the crucifixes, turning in to bats and other camp vampire traits?<br /><br />Don't people realise that, after a 1000 years of fighting one another, the whole sword thing get's a little rusty? Why not use silver nitrate bullets for your average werewolf, I would!<br /><br />And to those saying that lycan means wolf - uh, hello? It means someone who has the ability to transform in to a wolf - thus, werewolf! It's called lycanthropy - thus, lycan!<br /><br />Anyway - as for the movie, a brilliant combination of storyline, not too much special effects, and a brilliant set layout. By the end of the movie, you have the real sensation that if you go and find yourself a nice sewer system on a rainy night, you better be  packin something heavier then your keys.<br /><br />I liked the way that it didn't overdo any of the traditional aspects, and gave a new look in to the history of the two traditional 'creatures of the night'.<br /><br />I've been watching a lot of the similar TV shows and movies, (Buffy, Angel, etc) and have come to really like the stories that surround them. I think this is a good addition to anyones collection, whether you're a fan of the action movie or of the bitey kind.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|i bought this album a couple of days ago and have had time to listen to it just once. this one does not need to grow on you. it is simply one of the most beautiful body of rock music i have ever listened to. <br /> <br />one cannot be on the edge at 60. gilmour doesn't even try to be. edge has given way to sheer elegance. the trade mark pink floyd feel canot make itself absent, and that is gilmour's strength anyway. but those distant sounding almost desolate harmonies are replaced by shimmering, iridiscent textures. turn it on and float away... <br /> <br />gilmour still has his musical sensibilities. and some terrific friends to collaborate with. <br /> <br />sunu charles
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead has done it again. Like many of their albums, the music is something that you have to soak in, maybe even contemplate, or wonder. I found something haunting about Hail to the Thief, which purveyed a more profound dimension to the band (and to Thom Yorke's chillingly beautiful, versatile voice). I found all of the songs to be very intriguing, creative, experimental, eccentric, and beautiful. The highlight of the whole album for me was \\"A Wolf At the Door,\\" which left me breathless. It somehow touched a certain emotion in me that I can't explain. Radiohead continues to reinvent their sound, creating a innovative concoction of depth, honesty, fear, humor, sadness, and life with darkness and pain. I highly recommend this album along with OK COMPUTER and THE BENDS.
0671027387|2.0|The first Dan Brown book I read was Angels and Demons and it was awesome. It was fast-paced, good writing and I just could not seem to put the book down. The second book I read was The Da Vinci Code, it was good, I was a little under whelmed especially because of the ending but over all the book had great ideas which hid the fact that Dan Brown's writing is amateur.<br /><br />However, Deception Point showed very clearly that Dan Brown's writing is overrated. This book like the previous one's, also had some good ideas but lacked the fast-pacedness of his previous books. It took me 8 days to finish it which is, according to me, a lot of days for a Dan Brown novel. The word \\"amazed\\" was used constantly to explain an idea. For Example, Rachel was amazed to see this; he was amazed to see that. This kind of writing made me feel stupid, as if he were writing for a ten year old.<br /><br />There were a lot of inconsistencies through out the book, some points that did not make sense or were not physically possible. I skipped a whole of lot pages near the end where Rachel and Michael were on the ship trying to save themselves, mainly because they were useless and were not related to the story at all. These kinds of scenarios made the book boring at times.<br /><br />If there is nothing to do and you are on a plane, like I was, then maybe you should read this book otherwise, you are not missing a whole lot. If you want to read a Dan Brown novel, read Angels & Demons. I'm just upset that I wasted my $7.99 on this. Dan Brown is over rated.
B00022LRXA|5.0|Most reviewers have pointed out the presence of upbeat songs, ethereal lyrical explorations, and all out ambience on this album, and it's definitely full of gorgeous examples of all three.  Although this is often classified as a transitional album because it houses so many varieties of songs, I think they work stunningly well together; While his first two solo albums are truly wonderful, the constant up-tempo pace was a bit relentless.  \\"Another Green World\\" introduced the ambience to stunning effect, but I think the amalgamation of each style is fully realized on this album.  The styles of song are interspersed just enough to balance the album out, and really \\"take you places\\".  Plus, the songs in each style on this album can certainly rival the best of Eno's previous three albums:  \\"Backwater\\" and \\"kurt's Rejoinder\\" match any highlight off \\"Warm Jets\\" or \\"Tiger Mountain\\", while \\"Here he Comes\\" and \\"Spider and I\\" easily match \\"Another Green World\\" in pure ethereal aesthetic.  Moreover, everything on this album is quite catchy, and almost certainly mood-inducing.  Just get it already!
B0000009XP|5.0|It is hard to compare this album with anything prior to or after. It stands alone in my Buddy Guy collection, and I have all that I can get my hands on.  <br />This album introduced me to Buddy Guy. I made me a true fan. This is reminiscent of the first times I saw him live at the Chestnut Cabaret in Philly in the summer of '85 I think. Back to back nights. Not a lot of people at the shows in those days (in Philly in the summer everyone is \\"down the shore\\"). But he played it just as hard as he does now in front of packed venues. Had the honor of passing him a Cognac at one point of the show. He used to walk through the crowd to the side door, walk outside and stand there for a while and continue jamming on the sidewalk. Truly amazing guitar player, and what a great all-around performer. If he couldn't play a note on the guitar, his voice would have made him a star. <br />Don't think about getting this album, get it. Now. It will not disappoint. \\"When I Left Home\\" is unbelievable. Check it out.  <br />
B00009UW0N|5.0|No Horror fan can deny how great Halloween is. If you don't like this movie, you don't like horror, period. What's there left to say? Well, I'll try to add some more. When people think of Slasher Movies, they usually think of some out-of-focused horror film that isn't about anything other than butchering naked teens, with a plot that doesn't go anywhere. That couldn't be further from the truth. Granted, there *are* a few Slasher movies like that (like some of the F13 sequels), but they're low in amount. Nope, Halloween is a true art-horror film. It also stands for everything great about Slasher movies.<br /><br />One intersting feature about Halloween is that there is hardly any gore in the movie. That's right. Hardly ANY gore. Strangely enough, it scares the hell out of you. Do you have ANY idea how hard that is to pull off? That's probably a question for experienced horror fans. Anyway, if you aske me, the best parts of the film are the beginning - which is a flash-back of when Michael killed his nude sister with a knife whil she was in the bathtub - and the ending - where Michael is supposdely dead but he's actually in the house right then and there waiting for his sister!<br /><br />This will definately go down in history as one of the greatest movies in Slasher history, along with other great Slasher movies like Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday The 13th, etc. You can't call yourself a horror fan/Slasher film fan until you've seen Halloween!<br /><br />\\"HE NEVER DIES!!!\\"
B000F48CD8|4.0|This CD may not change your life.  It may not be the greatest thing your ears have ever happened upon.  But, it's a lot of fun.  And sometimes I think we forget that one of the best things about music is the smile it puts on our faces.  I really enjoy listening to this CD.  Period.  No comparisons needed, no deep, profound thoughts about whether or not it is better, same or worse than anything . . . it's fun.  These people make good music.  So stop the internal dialogue right there.  Remember that it's okay to enjoy yourselves sometimes.  Really.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Because this isn't Pink Floyd or an attempt to recreate Pink Floyd... and there's absolutely no reason to expect it to be so. What it is - and what the title, cover art and credits clearly imply it is - is an album of mellow music by a hugely talented & experienced 60 year old rock star and his friends. Sure large parts of it sound like Pink Floyd on tranquilisers but that's hardly surprising given Gilmour's immense vocal, instrumental and melodic influence on the group's past work... you can't change the way the man sings & plays but reviewing it in the context of where Pink Floyd were or where you might hope they should be is unfair and ridiculously myopic.    So, having taken time to read the box, does it live up to expectations? Well there's no likelihood of David Gilmour being visited by his local Trade Descriptions office here because what it delivers is exactly what you should expect: a set of high quality, immaculately played and often quite beautifully reflective laid-back rock songs. Nothing more and nothing less. And, if you're prepared to accept it for what it is, you're in for a real treat as you're gradually drawn into one of the best albums of its type out there - and, if you're not, well maybe it's time to lock away your preconceptions and accept that people, even ageing rock stars, change... sometimes for the better.
B000002N2N|5.0|There's something about the Ramones that makes them enjoyable.  The innocence of their early songs and the fact that their early infulences were 60's based music may have something to do with it. <br /> <br />It's Alive captures the Ramones at their absolute peak.  About a month ago, when I first purchased this album, I could already feel the adrenaline rushing through my body as I pushed play. <br /> <br />There's nothing that can compare to a Ramones concert.  I've heard Hendrix, Rush, Led Zeppelin (though How The West Was Won is the best I've heard), Cream, The Yard Birds, etc.  But the Ramones are the best. <br /> <br />From the first \\"1, 2, 3, 4!\\" from Dee Dee to Joey's \\"Good Night!\\" there is no a single pause longer than thirty seconds on this album.  Twenty-eight songs are played at breakneck speed, hitting on favorites of every Ramones fan.  If you love the Ramones, this will surely make its way to being your favorite Ramones album.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is one of the few movies today that deserve a 5-Star status. Not only does this movie combined a emotionally moving script and world renowned conducting, but the actors and actresses also stayed true to the characters. You literally feel the boundaries between you and the story, and the actors and their characters shatter, placing you in a new reality; one that you have never witnessed before. <br /> <br />Though this movie does have minor flaws (such as the lack of aging and the characters aren't the best examples of humanity) It is surprising how people can use these flaws against these movies. Such actions demonstrate a lack of intelligence, since much more can be said about all other movies today. Nevertheless, this movie will remain in history for years to come, and it is my hope that every person living today at least have one copy of this amazing movie in their movie collection.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I wish every Beatles album received the treatment of being remastered to 24-bit quality.  The result is crystal clear sound and a whole new listening experience. <br /> <br />Let It Be has always been my second favorite Beatles album (the first being Revolver, if you care).  I was excited to find it remastered.  Like I said before, the result is a whole new listening experience. <br /> <br />The sound is clear, and some songs sound different because of the clearer, superior sound.  The \\"Let It Be\\" solos are better, different tones can be heard from the guitars. <br /> <br />\\"Fly on the Wall,\\" the second disk included in this package, is a \\"unique insight\\" into the making of Let It Be.  Containing snippets of different songs and interviews, it reveal different sides to the members of the band. <br /> <br />Let It Be . . . Naked is definately what I would want from Apple (I don't know what other people are talking about), and I hope that all Beatles albums receive this treatment.
0802130208|5.0|\\"What an egregious offense to taste and decency!\\"     So it appears I am forced to rate again; to expiate the dissenting views of fellow readers, and thereby reinstate my original (not to mention incontrovertible) viewpoint. In regard to the above sir's petition to proffer some entertaining excerpt, some comic citation, some redeeming rhetoric. I shall rise to the occasion:    Dialogue between Ignatius and his mother as follows;      \\"Oh, my God,\\" Ignatius said, \\"you have powder all over your dress, although that is probably one of Mrs. Battaglia's beauty hints.\\"     \\"Why you always knocking Santa, Ignatius?\\"    \\"She appears to have been knocked a bit in her life already. Up rather than down. If she ever nears me, however, the direction will be reversed.\\"    \\"Ignatius!\\"    \\"She also brings to mind the vulgarism 'knockers.'\\"     \\"Santa's a grammaw. You oughta be ashamed.\\"    Not the greatest exemplum of Toole's literary trenchancy, (or genius for that matter) but I'm quite fond of it nonetheless.    Hopefully that clever little excerpt will afford you all a change of heart.    Although...  Perhaps there is some veracity throughout the minority after all.  There's two sides to every story, and, in this particular story's composition, Toole did resolve to take his own life shortly thereafter. Food for thought, if nothing more.    Anyway, my rating remains as stands, abiding and true.    And to Ignatius, the green cap mother; your 'blue and yellow eyes', your 'worldview', your 'theology and perhaps geometry', your 'value judgments', your 'Dr. Nut', 'Fortuna' and her fateful 'spinnings', your constant and incessantly frivolous 'procurement' of 'something to eat', your 'taste and decency', and your fear of 'perversion' and the 'blighted bourgeois' (relative to your Medieval (Boethius induced) philosophy) will live on in my heart, in perpetuity. I salute you, Ignatius J. Reilly.    And your father as well;    \\"I suspect that I am the result of a particularly weak conception on the part of my father.

B000AP04FG|4.0|I really didn't think this movie was too bad.  I liked it a lot, actually.  I heard some negative reviews, and some wishy washy ones, but I found myself enjoying the movie very much throughout.  Neat little story about husband and wife both being hit-men, and ending up trying to take each other out.  It was predictable, yet still enjoyable.<br /><br />Jolie was Goddess-like, and Pitt was as cool as they come.  Those two together on the screen was fantastic, and I'd love to see them in another film together.  Definitely worth seeing.

That accounts for the warmth of the recording. It remains the standard against which all else is measured.
B0001HK21Y|4.0|Based upon the wonderful, well-written novel \\"Red Dragon\\" by Thomas Harris, this is a superior and chilling thriller. Grim and gripping, it features Edward Norton in the role of troubled, retired FBI agent, Will Graham, who is called back to service in order to track down a bizarre serial killer, known as the \\"Tooth Fairy\\". It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mindset and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by Anthony Hopkins. Unfortunately for Graham, Hannibal has not forgotten that Graham was responsible for his changed circumstances.<br /><br />It is Hannibal Lecter, after all, who was the catalyst for Will Graham's retirement. The viewer is treated to scenes of Lecter's life, before he was revealed to be Hannibal the Cannibal, one of the sickest serial killers ever to strike. The viewer sees the renowned psychiatrist in his milieu as an erudite, cultured, and wealthy patron of the arts. A noted gourmand, Dr. Lecter liked nothing better than to give intimate dinner parties for the favored few. Of course, some of the ingredients used for his dinners were best left unsaid. It was nice to see the always excellent John Rubenstein in the small role of a dinner guest, heaping accolades upon Hannibal for his dinner parties.<br /><br />The movie is compelling and, at all times, gripping. Anthony Hopkins reprises his career defining role and steals the show (Really, Hannibal Lecter has become all but a cottage industry for him!). With a twinkle in his eye, he is, in his low key way, deliciously malevolent. Edward Norton, one of the best young actors around, gives a decent and sensitive portrayal of Will Graham, the angst ridden former FBI agent and profiler, but lacks the grittiness and hard-edged veneer that the role really demands. He also simply looks too young and soft for the role. Ralph Fiennes gives a fine performance as the tormented Francis Dolarhyde, but his portrayal is hampered by the fact that too little is revealed in the film about what makes him tick.<br /><br />Emily Watson affectingly plays a blind woman who becomes romantically involved with Francis Dolarhyde. It is her involvement with him that helps bring the film to its stunning conclusion. Moreover, Ms. Watson is a wonderfully talented British actress who manages to get her American accent down pat. Good performances by Harvey Keitel, as Graham's former boss, and Mary Louise Parker, as Graham's wife, round out this fine, ensemble cast.<br /><br />This film is a taut, unnerving psychological thriller that is subject to comparison to its 1986 predecessor \\"Manhunter. Having seen both, I call it a draw. This current version had a bigger budget, so obviously it has better production values. Also, the opening scenes in the current version are more interesting than those in the 1986 one. Music, however, was used to much better effect in the earlier version. Moreover, the final scenes in the earlier version were much better than in this later version, as they were much more suspenseful. Both films, however, are well worth watching. Do yourself a favor and view both. Then, judge for yourself.soft for the role.

Their message was pretty bold and I have a lot of respect for them for speaking their minds.  The music itself is their best yet!  An Excellent Punk Rock Opera! <br /> <br />And to the last reviewer who ignorantly stated that the album cover has nothing to do with any of the songs...listen to the Song \\"She's a Rebel\\" and You'll hear the lyrics \\"She's holding onto my heart like a hand grenade.\\"  PLUS, the concept of the album is that the American people's hearts are being trampled on by an administration that is reminicent of Nazi Germany! <br /> <br />
B0002JK75W|5.0|This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book \\"The Bourne Identity\\". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural \\"Bourne\\" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.<br /><br />Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.<br /><br />This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre. This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.py thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall.

B00005JMK0|5.0|Well... Like a friend of mine said once: I'm speachless... I set myself on a search to buy this film on DVD, it's one of the best movies I saw in my teen years: brings back all the memories I have on some of my favourite things, romance, love, hope.... Well, I could go on and on... <br />Please, release it on DVD!...
B000003TAL|3.0|In truth, I think Sonic Youth are massively overrated in indie circles, but this album does have some good stuff on it. The first four tracks are the highpoint of the album, \\"'Cross The Breeze\\" in particular is thrilling and unquestionably the best track on here. After that, things are a little more mixed, with a fair bit of what I would call \\"filler.\\" The main problem with this album is it's tonal repetitiveness and it's sheer length. This is a seriously difficult album to take all in one sitting, in fact I can't listen to the album the whole way through, it just doesn't hold my interest. Overall, it's compelling at times but I wouldn't call it any kind of masterpiece. New listeners are better off starting with Goo, Dirty or even Murray Street. None of those have a song as great as \\"'Cross The Breeze\\" but they provide more rewards for the casual listener.
B0000AC8N4|5.0|I've given up trying to choose my favorite Dexter album, because it's always the one I happen to be playing. I thought I might be able to pass this one up--not close enough to the culmination of Dexter's resurgence, too late in Bud's career, too far from the Blue Note studios, too dependent on a French (or expatriate) rhythm section.<br /><br /> Strike all of the above. Dexter never played with \\"abandon,\\" but this recording is probably as close as he comes to it. He's on fire for each of the tunes, complete and fresh phrases flowing from his horn in musical narratives containing more than the usual number of serendipitous quotes and allusions. At times it seems like no end is in sight, as the master storyteller is in Homeric, epic form. He handles the four-bar break on \\"Night in Tunisia\\" as impressively as Bird but with half the number of notes.<br /><br />I wouldn't call the performances on this album superior to Dexter's \\"Love for Sale\\" (on \\"Go!\\"), \\"Tanya\\" or \\"King Neptune\\" (on \\"One Flight Up\\") or \\"Body and Soul\\" (on \\"The Panther\\"), but it's definitely in the same league and should be essential not just for fans of L.T. but for anyone who's serious about the art of improvisation.<br /><br />Powell loses his place a couple of times (forgetting whether he's on the first, second or fourth chorus of a 32-bar song) but makes quick, virtually undetectable recoveries.  Moreover, his fingering is precise, his melodic lines fluid and complex yet swinging. And the fact that the original recording was made by a French engineer insures that the piano, though somewhat distorted (see below), has a \\"realistic\\" or personal and natural quality distinguishing it from the usual Blue Note piano sound.<br /><br />Count this one among Dexter's top 3-4 recordings, which is high praise indeed for a player as consistently brilliant as he. Dexter in Paris must be the next best thing to April in Paris.  If there's a caveat, it's the quality of the audio.  I was so hopeful that the \\"RVG Remastered Edition\\" would be an improvement over both the LP and preceding CD version, that I shelled out for the session for a third time.  Disappointingly, Dexter's tenor still sounds compressed, compartmentalized, and even grating, and Bud's piano still carries that trace of distortion.  In spite of these obstacles, the substance of this recording simply will not be denied.ovement over both the LP and preceding CD version, that I shelled out for the session for a third time.

0811821846|4.0|I gotta admit, when I picked this book up to review, it was right after I read another Chronicle Book called Stir Squirt Sizzle that I thought was the lamest, the absolute most mundane and probably worst kid's cookbook in existence, so I was skeptical.<br /><br />But actually, this little spiral-bound coated pages number is quite cute with some really creative selections.  There's breakfast, (I liked the twin sun toast, with two sunny-side up eggs put in a thick piece of toast), Beverages (a Yoda Soda--too cute!), Snacks and Sides, (Ewok Eats), Main Courses (Boba Fett-uccine) and Desserts.<br /><br />This isn't a book that I would buy if I were looking to cook with my kids because I have a nine-year-old girl and a two year old boy. But if you have a Star Wars fan/finiky eater, then this is the book for you.  It is also a good book to have if you are planning a Star Wars birthday party with its myraid of Star Wars-themed desserts.<br /><br />The suppers in this book number a total of seven, and they are pretty standard fare, so this book is more about fun than real family meals.  However, it is a great addition to your kitchen bookshelf if you are looking to inject a bit of fun into a Star War's fan's life.  I mean, who can resist a book with Wookie Cookies?<br /><br />For other family cookbooks, see my other reviews.  I highly recommend several pantry friendly selections that will save you time, money, and effort.

B000286RKW|5.0|It is among the top 5 films of all time, in terms of dialogue, acting, character developoment, plot, background music, and sheer entertainment. Scorsese pays attention to every detail, but does not allow the flow of the movie to be bogged down by the incredible attention to details. This is the rarest of skills...the only other films that I've seen that perhaps equal this are the Godfather (Part 1), and Citizen Kane.

0385504209|1.0|Dan Brown is essentially a very poor man's Michael Crichton, attempting to spin a breezy adventure story from some stock characters and a scientific/historical what-if scenario. All of the \\"scholarship\\" in \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is made up out of whole cloth, yet Brown misleadingly presents a lot of it as established fact in a pathetic attempt to inflate his own importance. The book's ideas have been called challenging and controversial; childish and laughable is more like it. But that might be forgivable if he had created an exciting story out of it. Too bad this book reads like the script for the cheesiest, most boring and predictable made-for-TV action movie of all time. Brown's smoke-and-mirrors history may have made this book super-popular, but the emporer has no clothes. Avoid at all costs.
B000021XS0|5.0|To get off topic for a second, I was reading reviews by people who bashed this album, and this reinforced my belief that ONLY STUPID PEOPLE HATE DREAM THEATER!!! Let's look at the people who dissed them. Shannon Hoon? Not only is he a mediocre one-hit wonder, he's also dead. DT is not just \\"egotistical masturbatory\\"- John Petrucci said in an interview \\"we're definately not stuffy prog-rockers who condemn any music that isn't in 9/8\\" so it looks like the snobbery is only one sided.  <br /> <br />If you have an ability, you should show it, not pretend that you suck just so other people won't feel inferior. They can't help it if they're more talented than you, and they also have more soul and emotion than a lot of c*ck-waving bands of today. And they're not as \\"heavy\\" as Slipknot or whatever because proving how macho they are by being the heaviest isn't their goal. Whoever was saying they're not that good as songwriters and musicians, go on and write a concept album, otherwise shut up!  <br /> <br />This album took a few listens to hook me in, but this is one of my favorite albums next to Awake. It's about time they wrote a concept album, and the concept and story are intense and worthy of an album. The intro shows their influence by Pink Floyd, as does \\"The Spirit Carries On\\". \\"Overture\\" is exhilirating and so is \\"Strange Deja Vu\\". All of the songs are great to sing, too. \\"Fatal Tragedy\\" has good harmony, and yes, the solo at the end of it can bring on musical orgasms, as well as the entirety of \\"The Dance of Eternity\\". There is also an instrumental at the end of \\"Beyond This Life\\" that shows the confusion of the character. To me the instrumentals are almost like conversations in music form, especially this one. Even hippie bands have long instrumental sections, but no one accuses them of being self-indulgent. The difference is most Dream Theater fans don't have to be stoned to get into the music. \\"Home\\" is probably the heaviest song on the album, and I don't care ifit doesn't include screaming and tuneless guitars, it kicks! Songs such as \\"One Last Time\\" are very much like a musical. \\"Finally Free\\" has that feeling too and I love the \\"feeling good this Friday afternoon\\" up until the solo, especially.  <br /> <br /> Like most DT albums, there really isn't a song I don't like, and in this album the songs are all part of a larger picture, so I don't think of songs in particular, I think of this album in its entirety. And in its entirety it rules! Everyone I know who plays music, or has knowledge or appreciation of music agrees.
B000001BZT|5.0|This has to be one the best Country Rock records ever made!  A must buy! <br /> <br />Chris
B000002JKA|5.0|To me this is the quintessential Dream Theater album, and the one that is most frequently listened to among fans I know. Some of the songs I am particularly in love with, but like most Dream Theater albums, it really doesn't contain any badly written songs, and like other really great albums, I get into each song at some point or other. I got into this album at age 14 so it has a lot of memories. Erotomania is an amazing instrumental that repeats one guitar part with an unusual rythm while putting in new pieces. Since it is part of \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" it makes me think of someone in a wild mental state, maybe manic-depressive. Voices reminds me of a stormy sea. It used to absolutely drive me crazy (in a good way), especially the part where James sings \\"love, just don't stare...reveal the word when you're supposed to\\" because it's so emotional and beautiful. \\"Lifting Shadows off a Dream\\" is fantasy-like, seems to be about being healed after losing hope, and it is a very healing song. \\"Scarred\\" is long and complex,dramatic and emotional, just the way I like it. \\"Space Dye Vest\\" is a slow piano song, and in both lyrics and music is one of the best depressing songs I have ever heard by anyone. These are the songs that really stick out for me but I love all the songs on this album. They all have a lot of imagery and will put pictures in your head (although the gorgeous album cover also helps). If you have never listened to Dream Theater, I recommend this album as a start because it gives you an accurate example of what they are like.
B00005ATQD|1.0|I usually just write reviews for the things I like, but this movie is so bad I was compelled to warn people.  My husband loves the movie, and I have no idea why.  I like wacky, psychological thrillers, but this movie seems bent on shocking the viewer, without telling much of a story.  So, a wife says she's fantasized about someone else, and her husband goes off the deep end, like now he is somehow justified in cheating on her.  This isn't enough to drive a feature film.  I love Kubrick, but how disappointing that this was his last film.  Also, that piano music gets annoying really fast.
B000002JPA|5.0|I was 12 years old when I first heard \\"Pull Me Under\\", and it pulled me right under, sucked me right in to the world of Dream Theater. This song reminded me of Queensryche, my favorite band at the time. I remember sitting in class, unable to get this song out of my head and I knew I had to hear more. The rest of the album didn't have the same depressing fury as Pull Me Under, but after listening to it on and off for a few months (hey, I was 12) I got into it anyway. Putting DT songs in my head was a great way to kill time in class. <br /> <br />Now it has been more than a decade and DT is more established, coming out with albums about every other year. Looking back on this album it has some of the elements of their later music, but it stands out as most different from the other albums. It definately has that late 80's early 90's feel. The mixing is kind of treble-heavy and probably annoys audiophiles who spend lots of money on stereos. There are more off the wall instrumentals in this album, particularly Metropolis, which goes off into a big jazzy experimental section. Some people don't like their long instrumentals but I personally love them and memorized every note. They portray a lot without any words. And there are plenty of songs that aren't crammed with notes (as one critic said).  <br /> <br />Pull Me Under was my favorite song on this album, but at different times I've gotten into different songs. I also got really into Metropolis and was rocking to that while most people were into Green Day- yeah, I didn't fit in. Under A Glass Moon is also a beautiful song with vague, poetic lyrics and diverse musical sections. Wait for Sleep is one example of a simple yet well written song by them and I also love the lyrics. Learning to Live almost had the feeling of Pull Me Under and was a great, dramatic song. Another Day is a decent song, although the sax turns me off a little, but it's kind of optimistic and I especially like after \\"they took pictures of our dreams...\\" Lately I've gotten into \\"Surrounded\\", especially the fast, exhilirating guitar part right before he starts singing \\"Was lost but I was found\\". This album has less thrash, is lighter on the guitars and has a lot of keyboard. For me that isn't a better or a worse thing; this album is not better or worse than other DT albums, it is just different.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Some reviewers complain about all the violence and the despicable characters.  But what do they expect from a movie called Sin City?!  These are, for the most part, awful people in an awful environment, where crime and debauchery are a typical occurance.  But I really enjoyed this movie... the visuals, the dialogue, and the non-stop action.  And hooray to Elijah Wood for playing such a sick character.  And this movie left me appreciating Jessica Alba a little more as an actress.  I found the movie to be both artistic and entertaining
B00005JOYA|4.0|WOW!!!!!!!!!!! Great movie. Probably the scariest movie that came out this year so far.  <br />It is about a woman who adopts a little girl who keeps having dreams about the city she was born in. Which was Silent Hill. Her mother takes her there and strangly, as there driving along. Variaties of people try to stop her from going there. But of course she doesn't listen. As she is driving, you see a police officer follow her. So they get to Silent Hill and the mother doesn't pay attention to the road and crashes and gets knocked out. When she wakes up, her daughter is gone. She goes into Silent Hill, hoping to get her daughter and leave. But ends up going through a world of strange, terrifying creatures, strange nosies, the risk of her life and ends of finding out about the strage past of Silent Hill, and also her daughter. <br /> <br /> Now if you are in for a good terror movie. SOmething that will make you jump, I do recommend this movie. Everyone should see it. I would give it an A-. Good.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|No other film I've seen in my lifetime calls the viewer to reevaluate their thinking and personal priorities. An Inconvenient Truth casts in stark relief the very real plight the human race faces IN OUR LIFETIME! Al Gore is simply the messenger in this story and this message should transcend partisanship. The real story of this film is not Gore but rather the drastic changes in climate in just the last 20 years. Gore articulates from every angle how mother nature is slapping us in the face begging us to wake up. 9/11 was terrible and terrorism should be a serious concern but a real weapon of mass destruction is headed our way that will dwarf the loss of that tragic day. No I'm not going to say that anyone who voted for the Bush administration has unwittingly signed the death warrant of their grandchildren but the Republican Party simply must make radical changes to their environmental platform. I reiterate this is everyone's problem. Al Gore's mission here is to illustrate that we're not talking about the abstract here. This is not something that we will be forced to address 100 years from now. This problem is immediate. Tsunami's, hurricanes, fires and floods are just the beginning. Now as a film An Inconvenient Truth could have been unbearable with it's grim message but Gore offers a ray of hope that change is possible through technology and political will. American's bear the lion's share of this responsibility as our co2 output far surpasses other countries'. This means that you as an American voter has been empowered to quite literally save the planet. I urge everyone to explore their Rep's environmental record and vote accordingly. The writing is on the wall will someone please read it!
B00000G3PA|3.0|I've watched that movie for more than 5 times and believe me I cry every single time when it ends. Bruce's goodbye scene is so touching that it feels as you are his daughter in the movie. Maybe the entire movie is not so great, but the ending makes up for it. Even though it's a \\"saving the World\\" movie, it's pretty good because every character brought some feelings into it.  <br /> <br />
B000001F2H|5.0|When I was growing up as part of the Woodstock generation, this album, mostly a collection of blues covers, was one of my favorites. In late 60s New York, Clapton, along with Michael Bloomfield of the Paul Butterfield band and Danny Kalb of the Blues Project, were the top three stars in the \\"white boy blues\\" firmament. This album is historic, because it introduced Clapton, Mayall, and ace bassist John MacVie, later of Fleetwood Mac, and helped to ignite a blues mania among the rock-listening public. (Though Clapton had been a member of the Yardbirds, he was not known as such in America because he had left just as the band was hitting the charts, eventually replaced by then-unknown Jimmy Page.) Mayall's various bands not only introduced Clapton, but also Peter Green, founder of Fleetwood Mac, and Mick Taylor, later of the Stones -- all exceptional guitarists. As a vocalist, Mayall is, well, Mayall - odd, but enjoyable. But his reedy vocals and keyboard playing mainly serve to set up some of the best solos Clapton has ever played. Displaying the thick, chilling tone, perfect attack, and dramatic construction that were hallmarks of his early playing, Clapton's solos here are jewels of the blues guitarist's art, displaying the influence of Freddie King and B.B. King, but with perhaps even greater intensity than his mentors. If you like blues guitar, this album's for you. If you like Clapton's playing here, you would also like his playing on Fresh Cream, which is closest in tone and approach to this. In fact, most of his playing with Cream sounds more like this album than his later playing, which is partly a result of moving to more poppish material, but may also reflect his changing from a Gibson to a Stratocaster (guitar jocks correct me if I am wrong!) And if you like the British blues genre you should also check out very early Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer, which has some great guitar playing and better vocals, covering a similar repertoire.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|This movie shows two friends going through tough time in life. Movie does not have a lot of special effects, but the action is packed with surprizes. This is one of the best acts of Alpachino. good movie you should watch it. <br />
B000AYELVA|5.0|This was an extraordinary movie. It shows you the mutants that were created after a war filled with such hate and horror. There are two sets of X-MEN types, or as we would say MUTANTS. The X-Men are the good guys. They help save the world by fighting the others. Not unlike the Lost, there are two sets of Mutants, but our X-Men which are some of the best work I have seen, as far as the way they are made up and shown to us, shows some of the most colorful Mutants that ever were. This movie is not your typical movie of Sci-fi. This has great plots, and great good guys to protect the innocent. They are hunted down, yet their friends are always there to take them all in. There are 2 other sequels, one just coming into the theatre soon. But you must see this movie and I suggest all the others as well. It has creativity, suspense, and it is a wee bit scary. But once you get to know the MUTANTS, the good ones, you too will love all of them. I adore these films. They happen to be a work of art,

B00005JOVH|3.0|MOVIE: The supposed final installment in the X-Men trilogy opened to some amazing numbers, but the overall experience was less than spectacular. Sure it was entertaining with some amazing visual effects, but it was just very plain and did not exceed or offer anything new. The movie never felt like it was going anywhere, I never felt a sense of progression or a sense of accomplishment by the time it ended. We all know the story, Magneto continues to lead an army of mutants against humanity to prevent them from mass producing a cure to the mutant gene. The objective is to infilitrate Alcatraz Island and kill the boy who they are harvesting the ingrediants from that are necessary to making the vaccine. The movie is a short 1 hour and 45 minutes, and the pacing is incredibly horrible. We open with a flashback where Xavier and Magneto go to recruit Jean Grey to the school. Here we see the very creepy and digitally altered faces of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen so that they seem young since it is a flashback. The digital age reversal was obvious and was the only CGI work that I found awkward. The rest of the movie tries to create character relations between Jean Gray and Wolverine, but fails miserably. The whole film is incredibly hallow and empty, there is no substance to it. That is one noticeable difference that we see from Brett Ratner taking the director's chair. 20th Century Fox didn't want to wait for Bryan Singer since he was doing Superman, so they wen't along with the production and hired Ratner. Why couldn't they wait is beyond me, it wouldn't have affected box office performance, Memorial Day Weekend is an overrated movie weekend in my opinion. So, with no interesting character relations we are left with a very disorganized and melodramatic action movie. The visual effects and the make-up in the film were astounding, and so was John Powell's score. I thought that John Powell did a much better job with the music than John Ottman did. One huge thing that I caught in the movie that really bothered me was that there was a huge continuity error. It happened right after Magneto detached the Golden Gate Bridge and put it on Alcatraz. Right before he places the bridge down it is broad daylight. However, instantaneously we switch from day to night. There was no time transition or cutaway to signal a passage of time. It really bothered me that they let something like that slip into such a high profile film as this. So, instead of being an intelligent film about the intolerance of mankind, we now get a shallow and simplemined action film.<br /><br />ACTING: All the parts were overacted to a point where it became painful to listen to some lines. Some of the dialogue was delivered so poorly, and there were a few one-liners that lacked the punch they needed. Ian McKellen is the only strength of the film with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart delivering good performances as well. The rest of the cast was just plain bad. Vinny Jones as Juggernaut was rediculous, and so was Kelsey Grammer as Beast. How Halle Berry won an Oscar still baffles me since she cannot act to save her life. Famke Janssen noticeably overacts as well, I mean how is she supposed to play two people if she is hardly able to handle just one. I blame the script for the acting problems given the poor dialogue.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: What kind of \\"Last Stand\\" was this? They left the end so wide open for another installment. Also, if you stay and watch the credits there is a bonus scene afterwards that also leaves the movie even wider open for another installment. They are already working on spin-offs of Wolverine and Magneto, so I really can't see Fox stopping with the main X-Men series since it's proven to be such a huge moneymaker. I really think this movie could have been so much better than it was. I don't know if Brett Ratner is the one to blame given the poor structure of the movie overall. His direction and vision was consistant and uniquely different from thatof Singer's, but the movie falls short of being anything more than a bland summer action fare.hat of Singer's, but the movie falls short of being anything more than a bland summer action fare.
B00004RJ71|4.0|The movie is based on real events. This movie shows new world that few people get to experience. The movie does not really have any special effects. The action is great.  <br /> <br />
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I'll keep it sweet and short...This is how a double album should be. It's Californication and By the Way smashed together but more mature, a little funkier (as RHCP should always be,) and just plain better.
B00005JOVN|2.0|When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be something like Titanic, but I was wrong. This movie is also about a ship that sinks but only here almost everybody dies in the first twenty minutes of the movie. Only 6 or 7 people survive. I thought it wasn't that interesting. It's not worth watching on a big screen.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is hands down the best album ever made! Period!!!<br /><br />I have had this CD from the day it was released, and it still blows away anything released by any band today!
B00008K7AM|3.0|This movie is hilarious! Kept me laughing almost the entire time, except the part with her boyfriend. It's has some offensive language and rude jokes, but as a whole-the movie is great! It also has a moral of the movie: Appreciate what you have before losing it. <br />
B000002U9W|5.0|This is my favourite of all the Pink Floyd albums.<br />I think the tittle track and Fat Old Sun are two of the Floyd's best!<br />A must have Floyd album!!!
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie is the bomb. Action is spectacular. The plot keeps on unreveiling more and more action. This movie will keep you in your seats all the way until the end.  <br />
B000E97HIA|5.0|I just bought the Prince CD on Amazon. I have been a Prince fan from Day One. I was disappointed in his era where he was represented by the symbol. I was afraid he had had it and would disappear into the sunset. This album is great! It is funky and upbeat. It is also sexy and seductive with a Latin flair. I would suggest this album to anyone who is a fan of Prince.
B0006Z2KIY|4.0|It's awesome. It shows the real passionate love that two people can share. Two main characters were awesome, they played very good in expressing their feeling toward each other. The movie is pretty long but it's so intriguing that you don't even notice how time flies. The scenery is beautiful unlike in any other movie.  <br /> <br />
B000F1IQN2|5.0|I don't think it's necessary for me to give a summary of the movie in order to say I was mesmerized by it.  The subject matter is extremely sad and I'm not much for being 'entertained' by tragedy...though the 2 1/2 hours went by very quickly.  What interested me most about this story is that unlike Jason Bourne and James Bond, the main characters are normal everyday guys with a cause.  No Karate chops, no fancy electronics or gadgets...it's believable.
B000EGCITG|4.0|I am trying to stop myself from just handing out 5 stars to everything, unless it's really fabulous.  So this gets four stars. <br /> <br />I like Pink.  I enjoyed \\"Try This\\" a great deal, despite the critical disaster it was made out to be.  That album had a lot of potential in terms of taking Pink in a new direction, and \\"I'm Not Dead\\" is the result. <br /> <br />This is a solidly done album. It's lyrically strong, the arrangements are very well-done, and there are a couple of tongue-in-cheek songs which we expect from Pink (and, as usual, some people just don't get). <br /> <br />There one major thing about this album keeping me from giving it 5 stars.  Pink really, really, really needs to lighten up on the constant use of the \\"f word\\".  Look, I'm an adult, and I use it.  But that makes the album a lot less friendly in terms of parents being willing to sit down and let their kids listen to it.  Plus all the \\"beeps\\" in the songs, in terms of radio play, and the videos is annoying.   <br /> <br />Stand out songs in my opinion:  \\"Who Knew\\", \\"Long Way to Happy\\", \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\", and \\"U and Ur Hand\\".  Close runners up:  the rest of the album.  There isn;t a song on it I don't like.
0440213525|2.0|My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!<br /><br />The \\"storybook ending\\" just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.<br /><br />Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.<br /><br />First Grisham = LAST Grisham.
B000000OYQ|3.0|this is in a sense, at least for the length of 'the only one', the closest we'd ever hear of the hard zeppelin sound ever again.  jason has that touch on the skins, it's like soft, but confident.  no one else has got it that I've heard, except for his dad.  sounds like plant is singing about the moment, zeppelin, 'the suffix', briefly flying again.  and despit the great sound and so many very admirable things, one of my favorite albums alltime, it is nonetheless marred by the other dreadful singers, their unbearable lyrics and delivery, cringe worthy.  page couldn't pick em after plant.  farlowe, coverdale, not to mention that other insipid song writer singer from bad company.  bad company indeed.  say page, do us alla service and re-release your post zep output WITHOUT the singers'tracks, i'm begging you.
1593072937|5.0|Frank Miller, the very instant he entered the comics industry, became an instant inspiration to future comic book writers, and went as far to revolutionize the entire industry. It was Miller, along with Alan Moore, who made comics cool for adults in the 80s, when the whole \\"funnies\\" concept of sequential art in comic books (politically correctly now known as \\"graphic novels\\") was beginning to die out. He breathed new life into Daredevil, he showed us the very darkest side of the Batman, and now he goes solo on his own pulp fiction series, \\"Sin City\\". \\"Sin City\\", easily Miller's best work to date, highlights Miller's talents not just as a storyteller, but a visual artist as well. Miller paints in big broad strokes, favoring a loose-panel page structure and multiple splash panels, and he does this spectacularly. Miller's knowledge and command of his characters create an extraordinarily entertaining read. <br /> <br />In his first yarn of \\"Sin City\\" Miller introduces Marv, a tough-as-nails, thuggish anti-hero with his own style of heroism. When a prostitute, so-named \\"Goldie,\\" Marv had fallen in love with, is mysteriously murdered by an unknown assailant, Marv makes it a personal goal to find Goldie's killer and give him \\"the hard goodbye.\\" Marv is an interesting character in that he is very violent, causes a lot of trouble very easily, and enjoys killing people (except women), and yet at heart he's really a good guy with a big heart...he just has an unusual way of showing it. <br /> <br />Frank Miller, as usual, lives to up the praise he regularly receives for his work with \\"Sin City.\\" Anyone who likes to read good books, or any graphic novel enthusiast, like yours truly, is strongly advised to read \\"Sin City: The Hard Goodbye.\\" And while your out you might as well purchase all seven of Miller's \\"Sin City\\" books, because once you've read the first one you're going to want to read the rest.
B0000042H4|3.0|Fine recording, good performance, historical in scope and a great box set.  HOWEVER: <br /> <br />Being a musician and an opera fan, as well as being a recording engineer, I own several releases of this particular collection of recordings by London/Decca.  The original recording of Das Rheingold (the first set of CDs in this boxed set of operas) dates back to the late-1950s, and stands as a landmark achievement in audio recording, especially considering that it is the first EVER complete studio recording ever made of Das Rheingold.  First released on vinyl and reel-to-reel tapes in the late-50, this recording has been re-released countless times in several formats, including an excellent mid-1970s release on Dolby-B encoded reel-to-reel tape.   <br /> <br />The CD collection has a glaring, horrible problem that I do not see mentioned ANYWHERE in these Amazon blogs, and it shocks me that no other musicians have noticed:  THE ENTIRE OPERA \\"DAS RHEINGOLD\\" IN THIS COLLECTION IS OFF PITCH!!  PITCH FOR THE ENTIRE OPERA IS NEARLY A SEMITONE SHARP!!  NEARLY A SEMITONE!!!!!!  Historically, there is an explanation for this.  From my understanding of the issue, the recording was made in Vienna on American Ampex tape machines that were shipped to London/Decca for the purpose.  The tape machines used synchronous motors that were erroneously not adjusted to compensate for the difference in line frequencies between the U.S. and Europe, and therefore the tape machines ran fractionally slow.  Play the master tapes back on a tape machine running at the correct speed, and the master recording plays FRACTIONALLY FAST.   <br /> <br />None of the earlier releases of this opera that I have ever heard share this issue, since all submasters of the recording would have been adjusted to compensate for the original technical error, and the adjustment done properly in the analog realm has absolutely no negativerepurcussions on the product outcome.   <br /> <br />The CD collection portends to have returned to the original master, and that may be the issue.  Nonetheless, why hasn't anyone with music knowledge raised the red flag about this egregious error in the CD release??  Why doesn't anyone notice??  I even attempted to write London/Decca about the issue and have received no reply. <br /> <br />Most people with good pitch will recognize when a recording is 75-80 cents (nearly a semitone) sharp!!  If you are a musician, you will not be happy with Das Rheingold in this collection, due to the glaring pitch problem.  A true pity, and shame on London/Decca.
B00004R7TP|5.0|As you know, Hounds Of Love was released in 1985, and is generally considered to be Kate's best and most popular album (although my favourite album is The Dreaming). The album is divided into two parts - the first part features the first five tracks, all of which were released as singles (except for one), and the second part is subtitled \\"The Ninth Wave\\", which all rank among Kate's best ever songs, and area all better than the first five.<br /><br />This masterpiece begins with the classic \\"Running Up That Hill (a deal with God)\\". This was known as Kate's comeback single, as her previous album, The Dreaming, failed to match the success of any of her previous albums. It was the lead single and peaked at #3 in the UK, becoming her second greatest hit there (you know the first), and rightfully so, as the video is one of the best of Kate's career. The song begins after five seconds of silence - drums are heard, followed by the distinct harmony, which made this song a classic. The title track follows, and in my opinion, is better. It was the third single and peaked inside the top 20 in the UK. The song is unusual for many reasons, one is because doesn't have a chorus, and the song is one of Kate's best lyrically. \\"The Big Sky\\" follows and is the best song so far. It is such a fun and happy song, although just scraped the UK top 40, as the albums fourth single. \\"Mother Stands For Comfort\\" was one of my early favourites, but because of all of the other songs, is now my least favourite. It is a dark but beautiful ballad, which is about how mothers go out of there way to comfort their daughter/s, and son/s for that matter. \\"Cloudbusting\\" is defiantly another classic, and the best song from this first section. It was the albums second single, and peaked inside the top 20. The beat is very memorable, and so are the lyrics, which are very catchy, and the long outro.<br /><br />Now for the second section, which may even be better than The Dreaming album, but as a whole, this album falls just below it.<br /><br />I really didn't like \\"And Dream Of Sheep\\" at first, but I really do love it now. It is just so beautiful, and slow, and was covered by Tori Amos not long ago. \\"Under Ice\\" is the best song so far, and again, had to grow on me. It is a very dramatic, chilling, sharp and out-there song, the the violins work excellently with the subject matter ie falling under ice, as the title suggests. \\"Waking The Witch\\" was another early favourite for me, mainly because of the way the main intro leads up to the first part of the song, which takes about 1 and a half minutes. It is very distorted, alternative and futuristic and hypnotic, with the stopping and starting effect, the bizarre lyrics, the male singer (who asks Kate questions in a courtroom presumably) singing lines such as 'I question your innocence!' (which was very memorable), and the helicopter.<br /><br />\\"Watching You Without Me\\" is one of the most dreamy songs I have ever heard, and if it wasn't for the loud previous track, it might just put you to sleep. I didn't like it all at first, but do obviously now. \\"Jig Of Life\\" is my favourite Kate Bush song ever. The song begins fiercely as Kate sings 'Hello lady...' to some alternate Irish music, and the subject is about letting one live, who fell under ice, in track 7. The refrain starts ('Never never say goodbye...') the song turns into the masterpiece that it is, and you begin to feel that this is a very very powerful song. This is followed by a 16-bar or so Irish pattern, with bagpipes as the main instrument which repeats 5 times and may leave you in awe, as after this is, Kate quietly says 'I put this moment here' and the song returns to how it was earlier. \\"Hello Earth\\" follows and is my second favourite Kate song ever. The song shifts from operatic mean singing long notes, to the beautiful ballad that this song is. It is a masterpiece to say the least. The climax is stunning as Kate and others tell sailors, fishermen etc to get outof the water, but you really have to hear this song for yourself. \\"The Morning Fog\\" is a loud (but soft) song which closes the album beautifully.<br /><br />10 / 10ve to hear this song for yourself. \\"The Morning Fog\\" is a loud (but soft) song which closes the album beautifully.    10 / 10
6305511055|5.0|This is a great movie with plenty of twists and turns.  The only thing I think should have been done is the creation of a sequel and it could still be done now, especially now.  The ending leaves you wondering with a sliver of doubt and that's why a sequel should be made.  This is one of Robert Redoford's better movies and Fayle Dunway does a remarkable job.  Max Von Sydow is cold and calculating.  The rest of the cast blend in naturally.  I've seen this movie so many times but the plot is so real and the chances of probability well done.  The director did an excellent job of directing the actors.  I recommend this movie and after growing up and working at a Drive-In theatre I have seen my share.
0780622650|4.0|Having never saw the Lost In Space series, I will only review the movie itself. Now some of you have bashed this flick simply because you didn't think it measured up to the tv series. For all I know, that could be correct. Still, I enjoyed this movie regardless of having not seen the series. The only con I found with Lost In Space is that even though it was slightly over two hours, it seemed a bit rushed. Even putting back some of the deleted scenes would not have added much more to the story although the deleted scenes were somewhat good. On the pro side, the casting was great and the special features are overall interesting. I am usually not a fan of space movies with the exception of star wars though I really liked Lost In Space.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Been a fan for 13 years plus, they have never been a disappointment to date. The work is different, yet they remain unchanged...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first saw Firefly on Fox, I immediately identified with the characters and actually 'felt' for them when they were in danger.  I usually don't do that with any show.  The acting is great and the story line so original.  Western meets scifi.  I own this box set and have watched it 4 times and have loaned it out to friends and family who also want to buy the box set.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Panic! At The Disco is a relatively new punk-rock/indie band that realeased their album last Setember. The CD has catchy tunes that not everyone will like, because everyone has different tastes in music. The lead singer Brendon Urie, I admit, does has a similar voice to Fallout Boy's Patrick Stump. The difference is that Brendon has a better range of vocals. Say what you want about Panic! At The Disco, but I think this album was pretty good. Better then other debut albums from select main stream (as of now) artists I've heard.
B000089RVX|5.0|Going Under 5/5  Love This Song my second favorite song. <br /> Bring Me To Life 4.5/5 If I didn't hear this so much I'd love it more. <br /> Everybody's Fool 4.5/5 Love this song, but the music video is even better! <br /> My Immortal 5/5  The best song on the CD! <br /> Haunted 5/5 Love This One! <br /> Tourniquet 3/5 Good Melody, but is the worst song I think <br /> Imaginary 5/5 Love This Song, great to sing in your mind when in a stressful situation! My fifth favorite. <br /> Taking Over Me 5/5 Love this song, fourth favorite. <br /> Hello 5/5 Great Song! <br /> My Last Breath 5/5 Ditto <br /> Whisper 5/5 My third favorite <br />   <br />
B000F3TBIO|5.0|Probably NOT.  There is little justice in the music world.  This is almost a straight through album, but there is one song that is a skipper and it is Kill The DJ.  It is still pretty early on in my Peeping Tom listening so who knows, maybe I'll grow to like that one.  That being said, let's start from the ground up: Kill the DJ = worst song on cd.  Next up is Caipirinha, not the strongest song, but in the context of the rest of the cd it is not a skipper.  However, I don't hear myself ever saying \\"I'm in the mood to hear 'Caipirinha,' anyone else?.\\" The whole rest of the album is pretty awesome!!  MY favorite being Your Neighborhood Spaceman - it reminds me of something that could have come off of \\"California.\\"  If your wondering what I'm doing almost quoting Tomahawk with the \\"grammy\\" title I used, it's actually inspired by Celebrity Death Match.  he says \\"if I keep doin' it my way and you keep doin it your way...\\"  and it is totally reminiscent of that Tomahawk song.  I give the music four stars.  that extra star is because the packaging is ultra-creative.  You gotta see it for yourself!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's first album, Let Go was a very impressive disc from the rock/pop tart. Standout tracks include: My World, I'm With You, Naked, Mobile, Too Much to Ask For, Losing Grip, Unwanted, and that darn catchy song, SK8ter Boi. Avril defintely has the chops, her snobby attitude is refreshing, she doesn't want to be a sweet, wholesome girl and that's ok. Let Go is a much better album than her follow-up, Under My Skin. Some of the songs on Let Go can be a little too pop at times but this album is a great and fun disc from the Anti-Britney Spears.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I originally purchased the \\"limited\\" edition (which came with the bust and special case) but apparently it's on backorder.  Unfortunately Amazon didn't notify me until the date my item was supposed to be shipped passed.  I wasn't happy about that<br /><br />Anyway- the \\"unlimited\\" edition was in stock and cheaper.  I figured I could live w/o the bust and case so I went ahead and purchased it<br /><br />i chose the free delivery option and this item arrived a day before expected.<br /><br />the DVD set came intact- the dvd set was enclosed in plastic and 'air' hags were placed around it in a bigger box.  thumbs up to amazon for the speedy and safe delivery
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne's sophomore effort, Under My Skin doesn't live up to her debut album, Let Go but this disc isn't terrible either. Her songwriting is disappointing here, her voice is stunning, and the way the songs are arranged is fabulous but I like an artitst that has strong and insightful lyrics and unfortanely, Under My Skin fails to deliver poetic-like lyrics. Standout tracks include: How Does it Feel, Don't Tell Me, He Wasn't, Freak Out, Slipped Away, Fall to Pieces, Who Knows, My Happy Ending, and Nobody's Home. As you can see I like most of the songs but there is no orginialty but I have to admit her songs are so damn catchy and sometimes just that alone is good enough. I prefer Let Go, hope her next album grabs my attention.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|First, there are several complaints about \\"pre-reviews\\" before this has come out ... but the transfer technology & choice is an important component in making your buying decision ... if they were offering a COLORIZED CASABLANCA, you don't need to see the DVD before making your opinion known. You might not agree with the pre-release opinion but it is legitimate ... in this case, here is a man who's know for wanting movies to be technically projected perfectedly and even sending teams to calibrate and certify theater speakers & placement but in this case is willing to put his name on a laserdisc transfer?    This is not a Roger Corman film release where if the reels are in order, that's \\"good enough,\\" this is George Lucas who wants theaters to convert to digital but yet is willing to base a new release from a compressed digital print?    The official word is that this is \\"fun' and \\"free\\" as a bonus so we shouldn't expect anything more - but if you think about, wasn't EVERY SCRAP of Star Wars footage digitalized and CLEANED UP for the SE releases back in 1997 and on? So, the footage is already there digitized and cleaned - the SE containing NEW scenes but instead of basically just going back to SAVE AS version #1 ... he decides that it's better to avoid that truth and just buy some laserdiscs off eBay and hit RECORD in IMOVIE.*     so, really, this is a slap in the face ... because George isn't just saying that we're not worth the effort but that we are morons to love the original ... that it's so unworthy of his efforts, we should be glad to get any version?    Sad.    *Okay, slight exageration but not by much ... :-)
B000EMGAOY|3.0|This would get 4 or 5 stars if it wasnt for the AWFUL mastering. The sound is compressed with loads of digital clipping. It's worse than Californication in this respect.  <br /> <br />Apparently they are going to release the album on vinyl LP in the next month or so, and it is being mastered by Steve Hoffman (do a Google search if you've not heard of him before). Worth waiting for the vinyl release if you havent already bought this album. Why couldnt they have got Hoffman to master the CD???? It's so sad, a great album ruined by terrible mastering. <br />
0142437611|5.0|Saul Bellow was one of the most prominent, sharp and intelligent exponents of the American literature.<br /><br />Carpe Diem constitutes a somber portrait around a looser, a man who systematically is incapable to win in any order of his life. Emotionally destroyed, spiritually demolished, financially bluffed, this man has been victim of the rest of the world in all orders. That oppressive anguish of visible creative impotence, product of a total absence of will, has transformed him into a true puppet.<br /><br />This corrosive gaze still expands far beyond his inner demons and all the environment around him is the extension of his passiveness. A candid looser, a tricked man by his wife, is object of mockery for the rest of his social circle.<br /><br />This novel was one the most bitter and crude works in the Fifties. It reflects the existential uncertainness of a weak spirited human being, immersed in world that simply does not understand him and besides incapable to feel and to cry with him.<br /><br />An agonic portrait of a man worthy of the most genuine compassion, and also the a bitter metaphor around a man without emotional center.<br /><br />Stunning and devastating.
B00000J7JO|2.0|The sound quality of this CD is terrible. Whoever mastered the album onto CD is a completely clueless idiot, it is far too compressed and there is digital clipping galore. Harsh and unlistenable.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I was hesitant to see this movie due to it being a GAY COWBOY MOVIE. Not that I have anything against gay people (some of my best friends have been gay) I just don't particularly care for Westerns and was scared this would be boring.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain had my attention from start to finish. And what is even surprising to me is... I liked it. It made me cry at the end. It was very moving. Very heartfelt. Very heartbreaking. It is an emotional roller coaster.<br /><br />What do you do if you fall in love with someone you can't have? You carry that flame for 4 years and once you see one another again... the flame becomes a fire that consumes both of you with passion, desire, and love? Love is the hardest thing to admit to and the hardest thing to let go of. This movie, shows how beautiful love can be... and also how heartbreaking it really is.<br /><br />See it even if you don't LIKE that kind of movie. You don't see any sex really... you see naked man bum but that is all. It isn't all perverted gay sex with nudity. Seriously. All you do see is a few bums and that is all. I promise. The story isn't about SEX it is about love... a deep love... and a deep regret.<br /><br />I really think the lesson of the story was Never Put off love... you have to grasp it and hold onto it... or one day, you could loose it forever... and you will be left with nothing but regrets.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I dont own this yet, a family member owns it and I've seen it more than once. Matter of fact even now I'm watching it on demand until I do buy this but its amazing and it shows what these guys went through, you'll draw your own personal meaning to seeing how tough it is when soliders have to fight its really amazing. I'd recommend this to anyone of interest and even those who arent too sure. Check it out
B000EBEHR2|5.0|You might notice a few lackluster reviews, claiming this album is not as good as earlier work. Why oh why would you ever want Placebo to stick to only one sound, even if it were the sound that created the brilliant Without You I'm Nothing? I would hate anything adhered to too much, certainly over the span of 5 studio albums. <br /> <br />MEDS, for me, is fresh and a rewarding listen. Where Sleeping With Ghosts might have approached too polished, MEDS goes to a slightly less overwrought construction, with a little less synth.  My personal favorites are \\"Infra Red\\", \\"Blind\\", and \\"One of a Kind\\" ...you might notice there's some more generally bouncier songs on this album, but it's not without weak spots, for me, \\"because i want you\\" and \\"cold light of morning\\" just arent my personal highlights from the album. <br /> <br />They took the natural next step in the evolution of their sound with MEDS. Give it a few listens before you decide what you ultimately think.
B000000LZV|5.0|If you are set up to play vinyl. If not, GET set up!!! REAL indie labels like SST never stopped making vinyl. I was amazed by the diversity of new vinyl being produced on display at my local trade-a-cd place. There's very little indie rock you can't get on vinyl nowadays. Anyway... The LP comes complete and unmolested. The mastering is also VERY good, don't let any concerns with the so called inferiority of vinyl sound stop you. Plus, you can buy the album direct from SST for $12.98. That's right, amazon marks it up,   everyone marks it up. Give the label the whole chunk of change for once. and BUY MORE REAL INDEPENDENT MUSIC!!!
B0002858YS|5.0|I agree with a reader below that says that the Killers remind them of The Cure and Coldplay and I would definitely add Depeche Mode and New Order and even some David Bowie.  Somehow, though, the Killers have honed their own kind of sound, so that when a song starts playing, you know exactly who it is.  The Killers may have suffered a bit of radio overkill, but luckily there are enough good songs on this CD to make up for that.  Highlights include the first 5 tracks and I love the mellow feel of the last song.  And guess what, the songs in between ain't that bad either!  And it seems that many bands have tried to jump on copying The Killers' sound, but none have done it near as well as The Killers.  Flowers has a knack for telling a story in a Morrissey-like voice with shredding guitars, pounding bass (love it in \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\") and a synthesizer in all the right places.  I can't wait to hear the next Killers CD (as they say it is going to sound different).  And yes, there will always be the Killers-haters, but that takes way too much energy.  I'd rather sit back, have fun, and sing it loud (cause I'm Mr. Brightside!).

B0002OERI0|1.0|I remember hearing all the hype about a new, mature Green Day; a punk rock opera, they were calling it.  A concept album that will blow you away; great, polished music.  But when it comes down to it, this is the same Green Day.  We still have the 3 or 4-chord songs with the same vocal stylings.  Let's face it, Boulevard of Broken Dreams sounds like the old Green Day stuff.  But the genius of Green Day (and I use that term loosely) is that they overhype everything before it comes out.  And this time they focused on the Bush Administration with rants that don't make much sense and stupid little teenage kids, with no political background, actually eat this garbage up while watching South Park.  Green Day is older now and have grabbed back their 15 minutes of fame (maybe the Beastie Boys should have taken notes) but at what cost?  Will this album be relevant 5 years from now?  No, it's not even relevant now.  People who loved to talk about how much this album changed their life have moved on now to the new Fallout Boy record saying the same thing.  Green Day will continue with their cursing and their liberal, uneducated politics, but it will always be with the same 3 or 4 chord song structures.  Until they can get better at that, why are people even listening to this garbage?  Here you go free of charge.  A CD that can actually change your life: The David Crowder Band: A Beautiful Collision.  Go buy it.  Don't be part of the teeny bopper problem letting Green Day control your thoughts (while buying Kelly Clarkson, Maroon 5, and Gwen Stefani as you call yourself punk.  It's not punk to try to be like everybody else and having Billie Joe telling you what to think).
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've been a RHCP fan for about 10 years.  I can't say they are a favorite band-but I certainly have been addicted to some of their CD's.  This CD is no exception---addicted after only a couple of times through.  This CD literally rocks, you can't help but get into some of the great rhythms and inventive lyrics. The guitar riffs are classic Chili Peppers and truely inspired.   <br /> <br />Some of the tracks are truly outstanding.  My favorites are We Believe, ReadyMade, Torture Me and Turn it Again. Absolutely some of the best guitar I've ever heard.  I'm an alternative metal fan and lean towards Disturbed, Linkin Park, Mudvayne and the like--but have loved the CP's.  This Cd brings me to a whole new level of respect.   <br /> <br />Buy this CD right away-you won't be sorry.  Anyone who likes Rock, Pop or Alternative of any style will not regret this purchase.  28 Songs of GREAT Music
0765315246|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As other's have pointed out, it's reminiscent of Heinlein's Starship Troopers and Haldeman's Forever War.  Can't wait to read the further adventures of John Perry.
B000EULJLU|4.0|... in a long while that made him feel like he wants to strap on his electric guitar and rock out. That's appropriate on several levels. This is very much a King Crimson companion band, and Danny Carey has made a strong statement for taking up the drummer's chair vacated by Bill Bruford and somewhat adequately subbed for by Mastellotto, he of the plodding right foot. In Carey's case, this CD is a tour de force, evidencing his polyrhythmic and abstemious skills to great advantage. So much so that he tends to overshadow and eclipse the rest of them.  <br />On yet another level, Fripp is just what this record needs. The band lays down an intricate set of patterns through these songs that seem to cry out for the long ascending sustains that made Fripp's such a signature sound. Tool wears its experimental soundscapes and found sound badges ( a bit like the most experimental of Pink Floyd) proudly. This is less a rock out album than Fripp's comments might suggest, but then, isn't that always the case with Crimson? <br />For my ears, I have found this a lot less derivative of their influences than previous Tool jobs, and as such, I've also found myself listening to it a lot more closely. Now about the naff cover \\"art\\". It wanders preciously close to Spinal Tap. Maybe I'm just too old for 3D glasses and tattoo-inspired drawings. Never did get that nipple-thing with the safety pin. More's the pity. Truth is, I believe I've chucked the packaging anyway. There's something to be said for the artwork espoused by Fripp and perhaps Tool might look toward Chalke Valley and Bredonborough for yet more inspiration. <br />
B000F4RHB6|4.0|This much needed update of 1996's TIME FLIES... kicks off with \\"The Heart of Rock & Roll,\\" one of five chart hits from their multi-platinum album SPORTS. [Curiously, \\"Walking on a Thin Line\\" didn't get included.] During the Eighties, Huey Lewis & The News were all over the radio and MTV. Their two most successful albums, SPORTS and FORE!, both hit No. 1 and nearly half of their hits on this collection are from those two albums.<br /><br />How does GREATEST HITS differ from TIME FLIES...?  For starters it drops the four tracks that were recorded specifically for TIME FLIES.... Moreover, they add the singles \\"Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do\\" (from PICTURE THIS), \\"Hip To Be Square,\\" \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" and \\"I Know What I Like,\\" (all from FORE!), \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Small World\\" (both from SMALL WORLD) and \\"Couple Days Off\\" (from HARD AT PLAY) along with the duet with Gwyneth Paltrow, \\"Cruisin',\\" from the movie \\"Duets.\\"  [The only missing hit--other than \\"Walking on a Thin Line--is 1991's \\"It Hit Me Like a Hammer,\\" their final Top 40 hit.] All told, this is a very satisfying and enjoyable collection of hits.  The only thing that would have made it better was if it was two discs.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, Blender magazine placed \\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\\" No. 6 on the list of \\"50 Worst Songs Ever.\\" Methinks the editors at Blender had their collective heads up their $#%@. While Huey Lewis & The News were never critis' darlings, they were popular for a reason--their music was good. Period.  [Hardcore fans will want the CD/DVD collection which includes nine videos.]  (Running Time - 79:19) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00000612P|5.0|Easily one of the best \\"classic\\" rock records ever. I'd put it up there with Exile on Main Street, and that's pretty high. How can a rockin' song like \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" have such energy and with only acoustic guitars? Mick Waller, that's how. The drums on this record are so distinct and thank Rod for making them so prominent on the album. Ronnie Wood is equally stunning, playing guitars, mandolin and bass. Some of Rod's best singing ever, every song he interprets (of the 5 cover songs) in a way to make his own. Notable cover songs possibly better than the originals, \\"(I know) I'm Losing You,\\" \\"That's All Right,\\" \\"Tomorrow is a Long Time.\\" The rest of the early Rod Stewart albums, sprinkled with some great songs, pale in comparison to this gem.
0425188809|5.0|I've read almost every Koontz novel in print.  This is the one I come back to, over and over again.  I've probably read it 15 times.  You simply fall in love with these characters--including (perhaps especially) the dog.  All I can say is, if you haven't read any of his stuff, start with Watchers.   <br /> <br />Would give it 10 stars if I could.  Thanks, Mr. Koontz, for this treasure.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|PrincessKylie, SexKittenKylie, DanceKylie.... It's all the same thing!  Doesn't anyone notice this?!  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!!  <br /> <br />But seriously, Kylie in any form is inherently H-O-T!
1400079179|5.0|With my typical generosity, I'm giving this book 5 stars!<br /><br />There are plenty of twists and turns in this superb comedy about a search for clues to the location of a long lost treasure.  And as for narrow escapes, let's just say that \\"The Perils of Pauline\\" looks sophisticated by comparison.<br /><br />As for the religious aspects, I wonder if there is a book called \\"The Perils of Pauline Theology\\" that I could compare it to.  If there were, I suspect that Dan Brown's book would look unsophisticated by comparison to it as well.  Still, the pun I just used may be one of the few that Brown himself managed to avoid.<br /><br />What has happened to suspense books in which actual murders are rare, and where danger, not death, is considered more exciting?  And where there are more irrelevant leads than relevant ones?  Well, no matter.  I found this book fun to read.  It did tell all sorts of things about various religions, much of which I had seen before.  One could, when faced with the choice of cheering for those who want the truth to come out or cheering for those who want to keep it secret, pick one side or the other.  Or one could sneeringly dismiss both.  Perhaps you can guess which side, if any, I was drawn to.  But you'll have to read the book to find out what happens.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I remember seeing the \\"One More Time\\" video and loving it. Then a friend told me about a whole movie on this. The music along with the absolutely beautiful imagery have put this into my top 10 movies ever! I definitely recommend this for anyone that enjoys anime, though I think anybody could watch it once and appreciate it!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|When Brokeback Mountain came out in theatres, I didn't go see it due to the fact that I was extremely busy at the time, and didn't think too much about this movie. When it came out in DVD, and received high praises from people all around the world, it sparked my interested, and I decided to buy a copy myself. <br /> <br />The first thing you notice after you bought it home and play it the first time is the incredible scenery the movie comes with. Then as you watch even further, you will develop an empathy with the characters, and truly feel their emotions, and their lives' story. The movie also leaves us with a suspended emotion, motivating us to create a more accepting and better world that does not destroy true love, which, itself, is worth every penny of your purchase.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is the movie which stayed on all best selling list for the longest time out of all the movies I have ever seen, and how couldn't it? <br /> <br />Director Ang Lee masterfully produced a movie from a forbidden script, which has been drifting in holywood for years. Not only did he stayed true to the story, he enhanced the emotions, and the essence to the story for the readers. The master filmtography, the extraordinary music, and the fantastic actors in this movie further enhances what this movie brings to its viewers, which is a true demonstration of humanity. <br /> <br />This movie deserves all the honors it received. In fact, I will even give this movie the honor of the best movie of the year, and a true art masterpiece. Unlike other films, this is the movie that deserves your every penny, and you will treasure this DVD for years to come.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This is a great album, no doubt about it. There's nothing new here of course, it's really just a fresh take on the 70's hard rock scene, but don't let that put you off, this really is a great album and never fails to put a grin on my face. <br /> <br />Oh by the way... to the earlier reviewer, 'XYZ', you need to buy a new Atlas. Australia isn't in Europe. Duh!
0446691437|4.0|Noted novelist Steven Pressfield's The War of Art is a short, fast-moving guide to beating writer's block, or whatever form of \\"Resistance\\" that impedes what you were meant to do.<br /><br />The book is a really quick read. I'm a pretty slow reader, and I managed to read it in just about an hour. Pressfield has packaged a lot of thought and energetic philosophy into a very small book.<br /><br />The book reads like a free mixture of Ayn Rand, pseudo-Darwinism, Dr. Phil, and a bit of pop-paganism thrown in to boot. It's a smorgasbord of ideas--take what you want. Pressfield draws a lot of interesting dichotomies, illustrating the tensions between polarized attitudes within the human psyche that he indentifies as Ego and Self, the respective sources of Resistance and divine contact with the Muse.<br /><br />The book is a smorgasbord, like I said, and a good bit of it is of the \\"take it or leave it\\" variety. Pressfield freely admits this in the book, emphasizing that the terminology shouldn't stand in the way of what he's trying to say. I found a lot of it good, a fraction of it hokey, but all of it fascinating and helpful.<br /><br />Since this is, essentially, a \\"self-help\\" book, I suppose I should say whether or not it has helped me. I think it has. In a world that emphasizes mass mediocrity and the opinion of our \\"peers\\" (the Ayn Rand showing through), Pressfield points out that, in the end, we really only answer to ourselves and to God (or, as Pressfield would say, whatever you're comfortable with believing).
0743267478|5.0|I just adored this novel and could not put it down once I became involved with the character of Ram Muhammad Thomas!  This charismatic boy pulls you into his life and you share with him the joys, sorrows and amazing journey that he goes through.  All the characters are so believable and I certainly felt like I was visiting the poorer parts of India for real.  The Lottery Win I really felt was an aside to the main story, that of a young boy growing up and making good depite all the tests he has to endure.  He is endearing, funny & wise with a big heart and it is this that gives him the future he deserves.  I felt saddened to reach the end of this book and indeed felt like I was saying goodbye to a good friend.  Read it and see what I mean.......
B000EGCITG|4.0|After the travesty that was Pink's third release, 2003's spotty-at-best TRY THIS, I was kind of worried that 2001's brilliant MISSUNDAZTOOD was just a fluke....that Linda Perry's spot-on production and song-writing was the true star, not the artist herself. Well, I'M NOT DEAD proves TRY THIS was the true bump in the road - gone is all the attitude and posturing, replaced by a new found maturity and thoughtfulness. Oh, sure, there's plenty of room for growth - Pink has yet to find her one, true voice, channeling artists as diverse as Janis Joplin, Kelly Clarkson and Joan Jett throughout much of the disc - but that should/will come with future releases. Even at this point, though, Ms. Moore wants to make it clear - she still wants to have fun and push some buttons, but she also has something to say. Nowhere is that fact more obvious than on the stinging opening track, \\"Stupid Girls.\\" A musical tongue-lashing towards the Paris Lohan's and Jessica Spears' that seem to be cluttering up the tabloids and airwaves, Pink makes it very clear that A) she doesn't want to be lumped in with these soft-core paparazzi princesses, and B) feels strongly that these are not the proper role models for today's young girls (\\"What happened to the dream of a girl president?/She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent/They travel in packs of two and three/With their itsy bitsy doggies and their teenie weenie tees/Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?\\"). Set to a blistering hip-hop beat, the song opens the disc on a powerful, in-your-face note. \\"Who Knew\\" has a wistful melancholy to it, showcasing a softer side to Pink that is neither forced nor artificial (One of the main things much of TRY THIS failed to acknowledge is the fact Pink can SING; she has a major set of pipes on her! \\"Who Knew\\" is the first of a number of tracks that remind us of that!). \\"Long Way To Happy\\", a song about a one night stand that lasts longer than a few hours for one of the participants, is the kind of modern day power ballad that's so popular with young female singers today (hushed verses, booming chorus), while \\"Nobody Knows\\" is a piano-drenched ballad, complete with a soaring, crunchy chorus. It's the disc's fifth cut, however, that will catch most people off guard....\\"Dear Mr. President\\" is an acoustic-tinged folk masterpiece. Featuring the delicate strumming and angelic harmonies of the Indigo Girls, Pink shows us a whole other side, one that is equal parts angry, confrontational, probing and intelligent. Neil Young recently wondered where all the young artists were, why none of them were commenting on what is going on the world. \\"Dear Mr. President\\" proves at least one under-30 is aware of what's going on: \\"How can you say \\"No child is left behind\\"/We're not dumb and we're not blind/They're all sitting in your cells/While you pave the road to hell/What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?/And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?\\" Powerful stuff. Brava, Ms. Moore! Next up is the killer title track, full of alternatingly suppressed and sweeping vocals, crisp instrumentation and clever lyrics (\\"It's the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo\\"). Then there's the tongue-in-cheek \\"Cuz I Can.\\" One might be tempted to think this beat-heavy groover is just a throw back to the poseur vibe of TRY THIS, but it's delivered with such a wink and a nudge that you ultimately realize Pink is just messin' with us. Another winner! \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" is a slice of pulsating power pop that gleefully chronicles the push and pull of wanting it both ways in a relationship. \\"U + Ur Hand\\" is probably my favorite cut off of I'M NOT DEAD....it's Pink at her snotty best! Melodically closer to the overall MISSUNDAZTOOD groove than anything else on the album, Pink's vocal is assured and confidant without being arrogant, while the music goes straight for the hips. Toss in some funny, albeit true to life, lyrics (\\"So quit spilling your drinks on me/High five and talking s*#t/But you're going home alone/Aren't ya?\\") and you have a real gem! \\"Runaway\\" is another mid-tempo rocker that hits close to home. You get the feeling that much of Pink's youth was anything but cheery....the fact that it wasn't that long ago allows her to mine those emotions, showing others that A) you're not alone and B) you too can survive this phase of your life. Another gutsy, brave performance. With it's simple acoustic sway and Joplinesque vocal, Pink seems to be telling us a story instead of singing a song on \\"The One That Got Away\\", a tale of doomed love and treasured memories (There's always one that gets away/The one that sneaks up on you than slips away/In a closed off corner of my heart/I'll always see your face\\"). Incredibly intimate and honest, it shows yet another (wonderful) side of Pink. \\"I Got Money Now\\" is a sad little song that seems to be saying that, no matter how much you fool yourself into thinking you're happy once you have all that money and fame, the fact of the matter is....you're still fooling yourself. Family, friends, people that really care about you....those are the best possessions. Things wrap up with \\"Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self\\", another ode to misunderstood youth, and the hidden track, \\"I Have Seen The Rain\\", an acoustic duet between Pink and her dad, Viet Nam vet Jim Moore. All in all, I'M NOT DEAD is sure to be one of 2006's best surprises, confirming that Pink has true star potential and, that, if she stays away from the pitfalls of attitude and posturing, could be in it for the long haul (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).n me/High five and talking s*#t/But you're going home alone/Aren't ya?\\") and you have a real gem! \\"Runaway\\" is another mid-tempo rocker that hits close to home.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|Sales of previous dvd editions have plateaued. Everyone who wants it, has it. His office is flooded with pleading, pathetic letters and emails crying out for him to \\"honor\\" the original films and issue them, finally, on dvd. After saying they'll never come out, he decides it's time to throw some wood on the fire and get the revenue / profit stream flowing mightily once again. As an act of arrogant, cold, cruel business I take my hat off to him. Talk about milking the faithful. Be honest - do you REALLY think he's EVER going to issue the unmolested trilogy? Probably, but not until he's put out so many permutations that he's FINALLY run out of release varieties and options. In other words, you will not get the optimum video / audio originals for a very, very long time. There will be limited editions, 3D, anniversary, high-def, ad nauseam. And you know what? He KNOWS you - the eternally devoted SW fan - will buy WHATEVER he puts his name on. Admit it, you may be frothing at the mouth now but you'll bow your head shamefully and shell out the cash for these. He knows you will. Lucas knows you want the originals and he's going to tease every last dollar out of you. Lucas has made a horrific mistake not mastering these classics in the anamorphic format. Barring a postponement for proper transferring, the THX imprimatur will no longer signify the utmost attention to quality technical presentation. It makes one wonder what will wake Lucas up to this reality.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I'm sad that Tarantino would be associated with something like this - I think it is beneath his caliber as a filmmaker. I will be hard pressed to trust him again, if at all.
0307277674|3.0|My moral issues with the book aside, I must say that Dan Brown is an excellent fiction writer.  He keeps the reader on the edge of her/his seat until the end with interesting twists, the typical 'high speed' chases, and numerous intriguing and sometimes sinister characters.  At times, as with any book, the informational passages can drag a bit and the reader may have to flip back a few times to reread a passage or two in order to grasp the next piece of intrigue revealed in the plot. However,a book like this would make an excellent movie and I fully intend to go to the theatre to see it for myself.<br /><br />With that being said, I must say that other reviews on here are a bit irritating, but not the least surprising.  One thing I would advise readers to do is just enjoy the book for what it is: a work of fiction.  It is no more or less.  To think that people would actually give credibility to something that is meant to be purely for fictional enjoyment is beyond comprehension.  A work of fiction should never be allowed to rewrite history or change entire doctrines that are hundreds or thousand of years old.  It is really that simple.
B00005JOVH|3.0|I was so pumped for this movie, seeing that I am an x-men freak. Well I think I set my standards too high because when I left the movies I really disappointed. Number one, what happend to nightcrawler? He sort of just disappeared which really sucked because he was my favorite character. And then Scott dies, or at least I think he did. Whatever, he wasn't in the movie for more than five mintues. And then they kind of made it a lot about Jean Grey which is kind of idiotic because it really isn't about her at all and it annoyed the crap out of me. And I didn't expect the same polt of the comic book but I kind of expected the same great polt the other two movies had. Oh and another thing, Logan isn't that loving! Okay don't follow the comic book but at least get some of the character's personalities right. All in all I give this three and a half stars because even though I was disappointrf with it some of the parts I liked it and it was intense and very sad at times too. I just wished they didn't totally head in a different direction with this movie or it would have be so much better. My favorite character is probably the beast played by kelsey grammer becauce that's probably one of the few characters played exactly right. Go see it if you don't mind be a compeletly different polt and disappoitning scences and if you're not a freak about it following the comic book and just wanna see some good action.
0800141660|5.0|... the romantic, Mariane Dashwood (Kate Winslet), exclaims to her wary younger sister Margaret while walking up a grassy hill on a windy day while the dark clouds of approaching rain hover nearby.  So goes a scene from \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", Emma Thompson and Ang Lee's adaptation of the Jane Austen classic.  The story, which takes place early 1800's England, focuses on the Dashwood sisters, Marianne, about 16 years old, and her older sister Eleanor, played by Emma Thompson.   <br /> <br />After their father dies, the Dashwood family, including the mother and the three sisters lose their fortune and begin to embark upon a more modest life, being forced to move from their estate to a relative's \\"snug\\" cottage. <br /> <br />The film, in essence, follows Eleanor and Marianne as they are thrown into love with their likely and unlikely suitors,  the humble and slightly bumbling, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), the dashing John Willoughby (Greg Wise) and the tormented yet dependable Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  Another key element is the loving bond between the two sisters. <br /> <br />From the sweeping and lush English countryside to the historic streets of London, we see the two young women experience infatuation, passion, heartbreak, patience, wisdom, and finally, love.  Emma Thompson's screenplay is both funny and touching, sometimes pointing out how the times were hard for women.  She does not follow the book religiously but does an amazing job in capturing the essence of the Dashwood girls and their struggle to live a full life amidst their limitations of both class and sex.   <br /> <br />The sets and the exterior scenery are beautiful, the acting amazing throughout the entire cast (including a younger yet still brooding Hugh Laurie).  It sounds like a cliche but it's true, you will laugh, cry and fall in love through the eyes of the Dashwood sisters.
1400079179|4.0|I read this book recently with the latest media fuss in mind (and to get the story straight before seeing the movie). While it's true the book isn't nearly as intellectually satisfying as the fine works of Umberto Eco, it is indeed a page turner. Practically every chapter is a mini-cliffhanger. And yes, it is quite visual, but since we live in a movie/tv dominated world, is there any wonder? Forty million readers can't be wrong! -- and they aren't even all Frenchmen (or French movie-goers). I'd have to agree with them, too: Overall it's a good, and fast, read. But what I suspect has made the book so immensely popular is that it does do a nice job of popularizing (by way of the action/thriller genre) a griping spiritual, or at least psychosexual, truth that's been around as long as humanity itself (remember those well-endowed Earth Mother figurines they find in prehistoric caves?), though has indeed been systematically repressed by Christianity and the other patriarchal religions.<br /><br />That said, some of the book's scholarship does seem sloppy. What actually happened at the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. (the telling of which, by the way, the author, Brown, puts in the mouth of his most nefarious character) may well be a point of some contention with the Church. Brown should simply have added a long paragraph here, or even an extra page or two, to his 450+ pages to get things right and make his argument indisputable, instead of egregiously oversimplifying. The fact (readily confirmed by modern biblical scholarship) is that there certainly were many competing schools of Christian doctrine (including Christology), and many other scriptural texts (including gospels) that varied from the canonical texts. And these doctrinal and scriptural variants existed from the very beginnings of Christianity. The Church's claim that the winning theology's victory had more to do with \\"the Holy Spirit\\" than with politics can very ably be labeled the Church's, if not Western history's, biggest cover-up.<br /><br />The book's plot is certainly not perfect either. For example, the ease with which the French police enter the territorial U.K. and do as they please (even as they couldn't do likewise in the British Embassy in Paris) was laughable. The answer to the riddle involving Isaac Newton, which gave the symbology and cryptology experts in the novel such pause, would have come to any school kid who knew only the first thing about Newton in two seconds or less (it only took me about three). One of the same experts' difficulty with DaVinci-esque backward writing (which surely everyone else in the world knows about) was a bit lame too.<br /><br />The charge of Opus Dei bashing looks like a crock. Anyone who's read the book all the way through realizes Opus Dei is exonerated in the end. It's fictional (and inexplicably gullible) leader even makes rather substantial monetary amends for his mistakes. Most of the membership are even acknowledged as mainstream do-gooders. But the practices of some Opus Dei members are indeed accurately related, and any organization that sanctions such medieval masochism and misogyny should certainly be able to stand -- if not enjoy! -- some alleged \\"bashing.\\"ory's, biggest cover-up. <br /> <br />The book's plot is certainly not perfect either.

One of the same experts' difficulty with DaVinci-esque backward writing (which surely everyone else in the world knows about) was a bit lame too. <br /> <br />The charge of Opus Dei bashing looks like a crock. Anyone who's read the book all the way through realizes Opus Dei is exonerated in the end. It's fictional (and inexplicably gullible) leader even makes rather substantial monetary amends for his mistakes. Most of the membership are even acknowledged as mainstream do-gooders. But the practices of some Opus Dei members are indeed accurately related, and any organization that sanctions such medieval masochism and misogyny should certainly be able to stand -- if not enjoy! -- some alleged \\"bashing.\\"
1567184855|3.0|I have more or less finished Journey of Souls by Dr. Michael Newton. It is a fascinating book whose premise is that one can find out about the afterlife by regressing people to the point of a previous death from a previous life via hypnotism.<br /><br />  I found most of the spirituality presented to be an expression of a positive functioning possibility. In my heart it only seems right that souls have time to progress eventually returning to their maker. In the spiritual worldview presented here the afterlife is not about punishment or even reward but about reflection, with a choice to come back to finish learning the lessons needed for self-actualization.<br /><br />  There were however two aspects about this book that bothered me. First off this spiritual world seemed to be overly structured. I've often felt that the spiritual world would be a little more tailored or influenced by the individual souls' mindset before death.<br /><br />  If one has ever read the Tibetan Book of the Dead you do not get a sense this is the same place as Newton's Universe. This is because Buddhists philosophy is not so much into a higher power as the individual mind. The mind wanders around naturally attracted to some incarnations as opposed to others.<br /><br />  The other aspect I did not agree with is the chapter on how the soul attaches itself onto another human being. In this chapter using only one subject she states aborted babies don't have souls. I found this part a product of convenient theology based off of the dominant political demographic that most of his patients are from.<br /><br />  If Dr. Newton Hypnotized dozens of people from multiple demographics I would be less skeptical, but in this instance he only uses one case study, not very good science to say the least. If Newton would want to be truly scientific about this as he portrays himself to be he would have to have multiple case studies and control groups from various demographics, and be honest about the results, even if they were contradictory.<br /><br />  There were also parts in his book that viewed self euthanasia in a positive light, at least in particular circumstances. These circumstances may be true or untrue I'd have to know the specifics to make a judgment, but I do know this that one needs to be careful when it comes to these subjects.<br /><br />  First off, euthanasia and abortion are politically based subjects, hence subject to personal opinion. To claim a side as objective spiritual \\"Truth\\", especially one that enables the killing of sentient beings, may break the spell needed to immerse oneself in the possibility he and his subjects have created. If this is turned into political rigmarole it may alienate many who would benefit from contemplating this worldview.<br /><br />  Finally when it comes to living beings and spirituality the principles of Ahimsa or non-harm should be encouraged. It should not be the exceptions that are highlighted. A respect for life should be one of the pinnacles of any healthy spiritual world view.<br /><br />  In any case, Journey of Souls is good read if read with critical eyes. As with reading any book presented as \\"Truth\\" it is like the old saying of not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. In this case glean what is spiritually functional by taking the child of what is true and good out of the bathtub of your investigation. With Love and nurturing care dry the child off.  And then, throw out that dirty bath water.and be honest about the results, even if they were contradictory.   <br /> <br />     There were also parts in his book that viewed self euthanasia in a positive light, at least in particular circumstances.

B00001NFCY|5.0|The 1990s saw the rise of Alternative Rock.  Alternative Rock was originally a term that was a \\"catch all\\" to describe those genres of music that didn't fit into the mainstream. In the 80s, you had Punk, New Wave, College Rock, Underground music, etc. All of these were considered Alternative Rock. One genre that evolved as an offshoot was Grunge. Nirvana really lead the movement here. I looked at Grunge as integrating elements of heavy guitar (to a minor extent acoustic elements), heavy drumming, and often a feeling of anger and frustration.  As Nirvana led this revolution in the industry, they helped bring not just Grunge - but the entire Alternative Rock movement into the mainstream.   Eventually Grunge would begin to move toward the background and an off-shoot called Post Grunge would take place.  The elements of Post Grunge music contain simple chord progressions and gentle verses followed by louder choruses.      For whatever reason, Post Grunge sounds now seems to be the dominant form of music.   Many longtime popular music fans have accused this type of music of being very \\"cookie cutter\\" and all sounding the same.   I feel there is validity in that statement.   In the midst of this transition from Grunge to Post Grunge was a band from Florida named Creed.  Creed's debut album, \\"My Own Prison\\" would add a third element - a Christian influence in their music.  This album would demonstrate how Creed rode a fine line between Grunge and Post Grunge as well as lay the foundations for a successful career.  \\"My Own Prison\\" was a good album, but contained a very \\"raw\\" sound.  It would be Creed's follow-up album, \\"Human Clay\\" that would polish-up this raw sound.   While I wouldn't call this one of the all-time albums, it still is strong enough to be considered the best album for 2000. <br /> <br />\\"Human Clay\\" was actually released in 1999, but it was an album that would have an impact all throughout the year 2000 and beyond.    While this is a very good album, it still falls short of being rated an all-time great album.  Overall, I consider 2000 to be a down year in the music industry.  For the year 2000, this album would emerge as the best of the lot. <br /> <br />As for the album, for all practical purposes - the Christian influence is not really all that present on this album.  This album shows some darker tones and integrates many of the Grunge roots of faith and despair.   Song titles such as \\"Wrong Way\\" and \\"Faceless Man\\" exemplify this darker tones.  Creed does a good job at putting a \\"loose fitting segue\\" between these two songs - allowing one to flow into another.   At the same time, there are still some uplifting songs such as \\"Higher\\" and \\"Inside Us All\\" <br /> <br />As mentioned above, I categorized \\"My Own Prison\\" as a Grunge album as opposed to a Post Grunge album.   This was a hard rocking album with a heavy electric guitar sound and songs of personal anguish.  I felt the sound of \\"My Own Prison\\" was too hard to put into the Post Grunge category.   One problem with \\"My Own Prison\\" was a raw sound.   The guitars of Mark Tremonti - as good as they are - contributed to this raw sound.   One of the problems I had was that lead vocalist Scott Stapp was often overpowered by Tremonti's guitars.  This was not a unique problem to Creed - as many other bands have had the same problem (Van Halen had this problem at times when Eddie Van Halen's guitar would overpower both Sammy Hagar and David Lee Roth's vocals).   The good news is that on \\"Human Clay\\", this isn't as much a problem.   On \\"Human Clay\\", things are \\"toned down\\" a bit.   The nice thing is that Creed doesn't lose their hard rock sound.  At the same time, we hear Stapp's amazing vocals emerge on this album - proving that Stapp is one of the great vocalists in the music industry.   This \\"toning down\\" puts this album closer into the Post Grunge mold of simple chord progressions and louder choruses. <br /> <br />If you heard the two major hits on this album, \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" and \\"Higher\\", you really hear how good Stapp is.   These songs are sometimes criticized, but really the only downside I can think of is that they were overplayed on the radio.     Stapp delivers more than vocals on this song, but a full-blown performance in this song that is a message to his newborn child.   This song also exemplifies how Creed \\"tones it down\\" and gets an optimum balance between his vocals and Tremonti's guitar.       <br /> <br />But this album will has more than the hits.   Songs such as \\"Are You Ready\\", \\"What If\\", \\"Say I\\", \\"Wrong Way\\", \\"Faceless Man\\", \\"Never Die\\", and \\"Inside Us All\\" are all very good songs.  These songs definitely will require several listens, but as you listen to them - you will get an appreciation.    \\"Are You Ready\\" and \\"What If\\" are cut more from the Grunge mold of \\"My Own Prison\\".  Both songs also continue to showcase the balance of Stapp's vocals and Tremonti's guitar work.   \\"Never Die\\" is another one of those songs I just didn't care for at first, but the more I listened to it, the more I liked it.    From a musical standpoint, you will hear the raw sound of Creed in the chorus and the more polished sound on the main verses.   \\"Inside Us All\\" shows what great songwriters Creed were.   The song says \\"There's a peace inside us all\\" - creating an uplifting end to an album that does have some darker overtones.     <br /> <br />The liner notes include all of the lyrics which is good considering that Creed writes some great lyrics.   Perhaps the only weak point is that Creed might have lost some of their identity by moving away from the Christian influence that permeated \\"My Own Prison\\".    This is still a very good album - one that I'd recommend.
0425188809|5.0|This is by far my favorite Koontz book to date, and is in my top 5 all-time favorite list as well.  The story holds ones interest from the very start, and never leaves the reader bored.  I laughed out loud at times throughout the book and cried at times throughout the book - out of sorrow and out of joy.  I think that's partly what struck me most about it...  I have never experienced such a wide range of -genuine- emotions as I did with this book.  A true testament to Koontz writing and storytelling ability.
B00000I3JM|4.0|Ever since I first heard The Blue Nile, about seven years ago, I was hooked. Paul Buchanan's voice was one of the most special I'd heard in a long time. Yet, as amazing as I found \\"A Walk Across the Rooftops\\" to be, they never did anything remotely as powerful as their album \\"Hats\\". As a matter of fact, it may very well be one of the best albums ever recorded, one of those proverbial albums to take with you to a desert island...<br /><br />Just because of that shortcoming, I cannot give this one more than four stars. It's pretty good, yes, but \\"Hats\\" is where you need to start if you are going to dig into The Blue Nile's music.
B00003CWTI|1.0|It is interesting how many of the people who give Magnolia five stars fail to mention or attempt to explain what happens at the end. I was enjoying the film, intrigued and amused by the anecdotes about coincidence at the beginning, and anticipating a conclusion in which all the interwoven stories, several of which are quite compelling, would come together in an amazing, coincidental climax. And just when the film seemed to be rushing to just such a crescendo...it started raining bullfrogs. <br /> <br />I don't think I have ever been so disappointed, or felt so cheated, by the ending of a film, not to mention grossed out (it is quite realistic).  <br /> <br />It is obvious that the director was unable to come up with the ending that the beginning promised. You can almost imagine the script conferences...  <br /> <br />\\"I don't know how to bring all the plotlines together. What about a rain of bullfrogs?\\" <br />\\"But that doesn't make any sense.\\" <br />\\"There's this book that lists all kinds of weird things falling from the sky. We could show the cover in an earlier scene. That would justify it.\\" <br />\\"It still doesn't make any sense.\\" <br />\\"Well, I don't know what to do.\\" <br />\\"What kind of frogs?...\\" <br /> <br />A decent film ruined by its ending. Buy the soundtrack instead. It is gorgeous. <br />
B000AP04FG|3.0|I don't like Brad Pitt.  I think Angelina Jolie is ok.  But I _loved_ this movie.  It was fast paced, funny, thoroughly entertaining, and just kept me engaged the whole time.<br /><br />This movie is by no means a classic/Oscar worthy.  But it's good, clean fun with some great explosions/effects, and just a rockin' good time.  It really helped that the chemistry was so good.<br /><br />I don't buy many movies, but I got this one.  Worth the rental at the very least.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Lucas has repeatedly changed and damaged one of the greatest film franchises in history by making lame special editions and continues to slap those fans in the face with this new release.      <br /> <br />Without a doubt the original Star Wars (Episode IV)in its original form was one of the masterpieces of the 20th centuty.  Unfortunately restoring it apparently doesn't fit Lucas' artistic vision.        <br /> <br />Well Mr. Lucas, by looking at these reviews, isn't it obvious that fans are tired of your \\"new\\" vision of Star Wars?  I can safely say that you have lost touch with what made Star Wars great.  Not only that you continue to ignore those fans that made you what you are today.  Sadly you are no longer a great storyteller or movie maker.  Nor the George Lucas that made great movies like American Graffitti and the original Star Wars Trilogy.
1881273156|3.0|This book is no work of genius.<br /><br />It's just amazingly simple.<br /><br />But I really was astonished to find out my love languages and my gf's love languages.<br /><br />Turns out you can love someone immensely and do all sorts of things to show them how much you care, but if that method is not their preferred way of being loved, all your effort is for naught!<br /><br />We both went over this book and took the quizzes on a flight to Maui (8 hours).  I was floored, as was she.  She shows her love by performing acts of service, but does not care to have things done for her.  Her preferred languages are physical touch and quality time!  Turns out _my_ languages are more about words of affirmation and physical touch, but I was doing more gifts and words of affirmation for her!<br /><br />So we fixed all that, and although we were doing great before, I think it's really heightened things now.<br /><br />Just check this book out from the library or something and spend two or three hours with it.  You might learn something.
B000957O82|2.0|A couple of redeeming things about this movie. First, Kevin James. His performance stole the show, and his budding relationship was much more interesting than the jaded exchanges between Hitch and Sara (quite tiresome). Will Smith is his naturally charming self, which he plays in every movie I've ever seen him in (exception for Ali). The writers of the movie did come up with some clever dialogue / dating tips for those of us who are single.    {Spoilers}  And now the bad. The movie was enjoyable up until about a third of the way through. Sara's friend is seduced in to a one-night-stand by a real creep. As Sara's friend cries about \\"being used\\" and manipulated by the creep, Sara becomes determined to expose the \\"Love Doctor\\" that she mistakenly thinks set up the circumstances/date. The problems here are many. First, why exactly is Sara's friend crying? What are you crying over? You went out on one date with someone and had sex, what do you have emotionally invested here? Second, Sara, instead of pointing out to her friend that she is suffering the consequences of fornicating with a known adulterer, blames the \\"Love Doctor\\" (Hitch). So we're supposed to believe that Sara's friend wasn't in control of her body and completely at the mercy of a trained acolyte of the \\"Love Doctor\\"? And so Sara must expose this predatory \\"Love Doctor\\" and his evil minions. So much for personal responsibility. Great Hollywood victimization logic here. Third, Sara upon finding out that the \\"Love Doctor\\" was her new boy-friend could have just confronted him with her friend's problem instead of destroying his livlihood and Kevin James' budding romance in one self-righteous swoop. And lastly, how could Hitch (or any self-respecting man) want to make up with this self-righteous vindictive b*&*h?    Fortunately, I got to watch this movie recently at a friend's house.
B00003CX95|5.0|I, unfortunately, had seen bits and pieces of this movie at various times.  Don't do it!  Finally sitting down and watching this from beginning to end really showed me how fine a movie this really was.  Like the best of action movies, those bits between the battles were just as good as the action.  And the action scenes were top notch!  From small fights to grand battles, all were flawless.   <br /> <br />My only quibble would be the love story, which seemed a bit to quick and easy, and Mel might have been a few years older than ideal, so it's not a perfect movie, just near perfect one. <br /> <br />DVD extras have really improved in the last decade, so this one is a bit light on this side, although enjoyable.
B0002S947K|5.0|I saw Ray LaMontagne for the first time on Austin City Limits - with Ben Folds - (check it out when it airs in your area on PBS). The CD is certainly worth your time. His voice is warm and complete. He's compared to others but he's completely unique. You won't be disappointed.
1400062071|1.0|This is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn't finish this. It is drivel.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|I have been a fan of Will & Grace for the past 8 years and hate to see it go.  Thank god they ended it on a good note. Unlike the horrible ending to SEINFELD this is a satisfactory ending. I'm not gonna say anything about how it ends.. Just go get it and watch it yourself or catch on TV.<br /><br />The thing that killed me the most about this is the behind the scenes featurette.. You see how much ASS the writers really kiss during the typical day at the WILL & GRACE set.  The joke are funny but not that funny people.<br /><br />I hate fake people like that.<br /><br />Thank god the show was as good as it was.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen is one of those bands you just cannot dislike because they influenced so many bands after them. Just listen to this album, and you can tell it is a hard rock influence and is an important album in the late 70s and hard rock and heavy metal history! Eruption is one of those guitar solos that you just wanna learn up! I love Van Halen!
B00005JLRT|2.0|This movie was just plain stupid. That Shinzon character didn't look anything like Picard, I mean give me a break.  Plus the humor was just so cringe-inducing.  It literally gave me a stomach ache.
B000062YB1|5.0|This is my favorite Slayer CD. I love the combination of adding more melodies while keeping the traditional thrash style of Slayer still keep it going on brutal. No high pitch waling on this CD from Araya but this is still perfect Slayer showing maturity in their music and lyrics as well - including some social, polical, and issue lyrics while not losing the horror like and evil themes that Slayer is known for. The guitar playing is more structured and fancier in this album - instead of pure random shredding as fast as you can, there is actually scaled solos and more melodies in this CD - This is probably Slayer's last super album before hitting the mid-90s but the later releases are still alright, just doesn't match the early 90s and 80s Slayer!
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I avoided the DVD releases of Star Wars.  Didn't buy them. George Lucas owns the movies, can do whatever he wants to them, replace this, enhance that. Fine. But I realize I wasn't forced to buy the \\"new\\" versions, so I didn't. I began to realize that maybe I've seen the Star Wars movies enough times for the rest of my life. Time to simply accept them as a cherished childhood memory. After all, the original versions no longer exist, according to Lucas.  <br /> <br />For the first time in years, the news of this release prompted excitement about Star Wars.  But it was shortlived. Too good to be true. Lucas has managed to do it again. I have no respect for him as a filmmaker, that evaporated gradually with the releases of Episodes I, II, and III. But I guess part of me still managed to admire the pure chutzpah he surely possesses as a businessman. But these days even that is gone. This release isn't smart business. It's his way of trying to prove a point. <br /> <br />What is his point? With this release, Lucas is going way out of his way to ensure he can \\"prove\\" that no one wants and/or cares about the original releases. He doesn't give a hoot about all these 1 star reviews. He will never acknowledge the reasons WHY this release will be a big waste, largely ignored by the DVD buying public. We aren't buying it because it's non-anamorphic. But Lucas will simply say that he was correct about no one wanting anything to do with the original releases. <br /> <br />I'm done with Star Wars. It was fun. But no more of my money will ever go to this franchise.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer is one of the most heaviest bands ever and their brutality is headbanging enough for decapitation. This CD is not very long, but is very fast, brutal, wild, and will kick your a$$. I prefer South Of Heaven or Seasons In The Abyss more because of the more structured music and more melodic style, but this is thrash - 100% thrash, pure thrash, a little bit too pure but who ever said that was a problem? About 30 minutes of mayhem later, you will find your neck hurting, or if you are a singer, your throat will be soar like a razor blade cutting your throat. This is a must have for 80s thrash metal.
1400079179|1.0|This book is absolutely atrocious. Disregarding all the historical inaccuracies and pretending it is simply a fiction novel, (a novel idea, right?) the characters in this book are boring and stereotypical, the puzzles are less than intriguing, and the writing style could best be described as \\"a submission for 9th grade creative writing class.\\"<br /><br />I literally hated this book and everything about it. The only reason it has done so well is because people can't learn to leave well-enough alone. If the Catholic Church had said to themselves, \\"This book sucks, let's ignore it\\" then Dan Brown would still be languishing in obscurity. But that's beside the point I suppose. Anyway, if you haven't read this (and you are certainly in the minority) don't waste your time. Go read something worthwhile.
B000002INJ|5.0|Power metal has got my attention for a while - fantasy lyrics, epic moods, melodic vocals - high pitched waling and singing styles, fast guitars most of the time, it's got the heavy metal feel and spot. <br /> <br />Manowar has got to be one of the greatest power metal bands ever. This album is probably their best with their well known songs and concert favorites like \\"Wheels of Fire\\" and \\"Hail and Kill\\" and of course \\"Kings Of Metal\\" - i dont conisder them the kings of metal but they are a king of power metal!
0140189378|4.0|A middle-aged man at his wit's end; his past, present, and future seem bleak. Mr. Bellow wrote with ease and humor about such a man. Although the character is in his forties and has barely jumped over one hurdle after another throughout his whole life due to his own naivety, he continues to make more mistakes than ever. The story takes place only in one day. In about 115 pages the reader finds out what makes the man he is. It is also up to the reader to conclude Mr. Bellow's account of this man. Mr. Bellow's writing was fluent where he detailed each appearance and action thoroughly with a very good sense of humor. It is a fast and interesting read.
B0000931QA|5.0|This album is the definitive concept album - Queensryche's polical lyrics really put together a powerful storyline that grabs the attention of the listener. Such a complicated story for me to understand at first but I love this music and the story as well! They need to make a movie off this album kinda like a Pink Floyd thing. I bet this would make a good movie: Operation Mindcrime. This is great progressive metal writing (more like lyric writing) but the music itself is heavy as well - this is Queensryche's best album along with \\"Empire\\". If you love Prog. and concept albums be sure to get this when you can because this concept is great. I'm not spoiling so you gotta get this thing for yourself, man!!!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I really love this CD, the whole thing is a good listen.  I can't really pick favorites because I enjoy them all.  <br /> <br />Their sound is mellow,  melancholy at times, but beautiful throughout.
B000086EOB|5.0|I DONT THINK SO!! These guys are far beyong hair metal - they are true heavy metal and not that false metal stuff - this stuff is actually rockin' and heavy. W.A.S.P. gets unfortunate genre-ing of hair metal just because of what they look but these guys bang their heads and go crazy! Just like Motley Crue, they are HEAVY METAL and not HAIR METAL!!! Get it right people - it's about the music man
B00004S5TK|3.0|Led Zeppelin fans are deeply devided in their feelings for the band's 1976 concert film \\"The Song Remains The Same\\". They either love it or they think it's outright horrible. Personally, I'm in the middle. I don't hate it, but I do think it could've been (and should've been) so much more.<br /><br />First of all, let me start off by saying that i am a huge Led Zeppelin fna. I think they are the greatest rock and roll band ever. I have never heard a band with more soul, talent, emotion and presence than these four guys.<br /><br />\\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is a compilation of select performances from the group's legendary 1973 concert at the world renowned New York venue Madison Square Garden. However, we don't even get to see the whole show.<br /><br />The movie opens with some weird (and bloody) gangster movie fantasy sequence, then goes throgh about 15 minutes of the band at home with their family and getting ready for the show.<br /><br />The concert opens with a flacid and uninspired performance of \\"Rock & Roll\\".  The band is playing with the least of their abilities, andPlant's voice sound shot. Next is a more lively version of \\"Black Dog\\", followed by a raw and powerful \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\". Next comes \\"No Quarter\\", which, while a great performance, features a horridly cheesy fantasy sequence, the first of many.<br /><br />After a few minutes of backstage footage, we get \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", which is a solid performance. Next comes \\"The Rain Song\\", which, while performed beautifully, is accompanied by yet another cheesy fantasy.<br /><br />After some more backstage footage, we get to the film's low point. \\"Dazed And Confused\\" was known to drag on for a good 25 minutes (sometimes more), but this version is exceptionally boring and the fantasy sequence is horridly uninteresting.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is pretty solid. The performances are all full of life and overall great, especially \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", which manages to go completely uninterrupted throughout its length. The movie wraps up with a powerful \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".<br /><br />Overall, not a bad effort, but this is not the best of Zeppelin live. Thankfullt in 2003, Jimmy Page compikled a new two disc dvd featuring concrts by the band spanning nine years, including lost footage from the movie. It is much better than this, though I would recommend buying both since this film while flawed is quite intersting and overall enjoyable.s up with a powerful \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".

B000002J0B|5.0|This has gotsta be my favorite zep album.  Not a summer goes by when i don't play this one from beginning to end while sippin' on a brew or two.  It is a feel good lp through and through (no quarter is kinda gloomy, but the feel-good vibes from the all the other tracks easily lighten the entire disc).  One of the things i love about zep is that every album has a new sound to it...the band was not afraid of experimenting instead of sticking to the same tired style that many, many musicians did, have and will do.   <br /> <br />     I think if i only could choose one zep song to listen to for the duration of my life, i would choose \\"the song remains the same.\\"  That song makes me feel alive and want to be around a group of close friends out on the town.  It's just a light rocker that pours on sweet, exotic imagery, for example \\"california sunglight, sweet calcutta rain, honolulu starlight...\\"  The drumming and bass is typical bonham and jones...FORMIDABLE.  Page opts for a lighter, but faster guitar and plant's voice is carefree and as strong as ever.  To move from this song into \\"the rain song\\" is quite a change of pace, but rain song is just as beautiful as its predecessor, but in a more elegant way, largely accomplished by the addition of the orchestra.  I know page and plant will never be confused with nietzche or joyce, but for pop music, they write some pretty profound stuff.  Like in \\"over the hills and far away\\" they write \\"mellow is a man who knows what he's been missing, many, many men can't see the open road.\\"  Compare these lyrics to many of their peer-rockers who could only muster songs worthy of appearing in a beer commercial.  Musically, this album is all over the place, but somehow it all coheres extremely well.  I mean you got the funky \\"crunge\\" (early red hot chili's owe a debt of gratitude to this track) the best reggae track i've heard by a non-reggae group, the moody/mystical \\"no quarter,\\" (that piano solo is killer) and the traditional rocker in \\"dancing days.\\"  I would give this album five and a half stars, but the ocean just wasn't the ending i was looking for.  After listening to a stellar album I wanted the last song to be phenomenal, but I don't know if it's humanly possible to create a song that wonderful!
B0002EXH54|5.0|this album was the 3rd cd i owned from megadeth then i eventually owned all of their cds. this is the album that first put megadeth on the map then they got better with albums like rust in piece and countdown, but this came out in 1986 where other thrash masterpieces were released like metallicas master of puppets, slayers reign in blood, kreators pleasure to kill, and dark angels darkness descends. a must have for 80s thrash metal
1400032717|5.0|This novel had such a lovely, refreshing voice.  I love mysteries, but I yearn for a mystery written with style instead of fomulaic characters and stilted languge.  This was such a refreshing break and though I read this story a while back when it 1st came out, it has remained in my thoughts.  I've gotten a lot of mileage from this book in my thoughts and memories and fell in love with the title character.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|this isnt that good. their missing a lot of key songs. this shouldve been released as a 2 CD set with their other songs as well - i mean these tracks are good and probably their most popular, but guns n roses werent mean for only 80 minutes of good songs - you need maybe 2 discs of 70 minutes each. <br /> <br />dont get this cd if youre hardcore into guns n roses - you probably might have all their other cds anyway like me
950491036X|4.0|This novel has its defects (somewhat unbelievable main character and the profusion of clichés), but stressing those too much would be unfair to its accomplishments: an excellent rythm, intertwined plots that are a work of genius, constant tension, and all the passion that the writer poured in its telling. Sometimes it seems as if he were revealing the details of a very intimate affair.    -----    La novela tiene sus faltas (un personaje principal inverosimil y la profusión de clichés), pero destacarlas demasiado sería robarle sus virtudes: un ritmo excelente, un enlace de tramas que me pareció genial, la tensión constante, y toda la pasión que Ruiz Zafón derrochó en ella. A veces parece que hablara de algo que conoció muy de cerca.
B000089RV6|5.0|Regardless of whether or not I'm conforming about liking the most sold and popular album \\"Back In Black\\" by AC/DC is my favorite or not, this IS my favorite AC/DC album. This is such a landmark in hard rock history, it deserves all the attention it can get. Brian Johnson is the perfect replacement for Bon Scott, this is better than the previous albums by AC/DC albums although the Bon Scott era would come up with more consistently good albums more than the Brian Johnson era, but this specific album kicks.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I was first sucked into this album when I heard the single \\"Best of You\\" and couldn't seem to get enough of it. And I waited patiently to get this album as soon as possible. When I finally did, and unwrapped it from it's plastic casing, it was like unwrapping a piece of gold. I love this album that much. <br /> <br />Soon after bying this album, I took a trip to Chicago and their was a lot of downtime and this was the only album I happened to have. So, basically, I listened to it constantly. And every time I did, it got better, and continues to get better now. Whether it be the sheer power that comes from the title track, or the hypnotic rythem of \\"Razor\\" every song on this dualdisc album is a masterpiece in my eyes. <br /> <br />I recomend it to everyone, or at least go and try to listen to some of the singles for free first if you're skeptical, but just give it a try. It's worth it.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Metallica's Load and Reload were not very good compared to old Metallica sounds but although some of the covers here were recorded during that era, i love it. There are a lot of heavy punk and metal covers on this album that Metallica literally make it sounds like it was originally by them an they wrote the song! they practially own the songs here! and metallica cover things cannot be completed without covers of diamond head and misfits and motorhead as well. i like disc 2 the best because it's from the 80s metallica mostly and early 90s which was the metallica that i loved more than the new \\"polished\\" metallica without hair and extremeness in their concerts. but garage inc is still worthy of fitting into your heavy metal collection and metallica cd collecion!
B000EBEHR2|5.0|This ablum is so honest and real, which is what I wanted to hear.  The lyrics are incredible, the melodies are true to Placebo's style, and the album makes coherent and intriging statements from beginning to end.  It's so much fresher than what they've released so far, although I'd give 5 stars to every one of them.   <br /> <br />I hope Placebo keep up the great work.  :)
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This sure go against what a lot of negative reviewers say about the world. Not only do homophobes exist, they even exist in 21st Century. Brokeback Mountain is about love, and humanity, but of course, to homophobes, it is just another gay movie. <br /> <br />Just a thought: psychology shows that homophobes are homosexual themselves. They are just afraid to show their sexuality. So reviewer whose name we will not mention, don't be afraid to come out of the closet.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|Even for bands that I really enjoy, I generally take a dim view of \\"B-side and Rarities\\" albums. With few exceptions, there is a good reason the material wasn't previously released; it just wasn't up to snuff!<br /><br />Which brings us to LOST DOGS, which is (sort of) one of those few exceptions. If one took the very best material of this two-cd set, one would have a single excellent disc of songs that would rival any other Pearl Jam project. LOST DOGS seems to be \\"front-loaded\\" with its best stuff, so Disc I is decidedly better than Disc II. But any way you look at it and depending on how you listen to it, you won't be embarrassed by LOST DOGS. (Well, okay, some people might be embarrassed by the remake of \\"Last Kiss,\\" though I always liked that song.)
0060763280|4.0|'Creating Wealth' is obviously a very hot topic nowadays. The marketplace is seemingly overwhelmed with 'Get Rich Quick' books in permutable variations. They have even resulted in countless seminars & bootcamps across the world, including Singapore. Whether they pump any $$$ into readers' pockets, I am not sure, but one thing I am very sure of is this: they definitely make their publishers - & authors - giggle all the way to the bank!<br /><br />The first book - & I would consider it to be the best book on '$$$' I have read -, is Joe Dominguez & Vicki Robin's Your Money or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship with $$$ & Achieving Financial Independence. I perused - & worked on - it enthusiastically in the late 80's, during the criticial period when I was going through a mid-life transition. The nine steps to financial independence as embodied in this book have empowered me to do what I  love & love what I do today.<br /><br />Having said that - & discounting the slick factor & hyperbolic stuff -, I actually enjoy reading 'Secrets of the Millionaire Mind', especially the Wealth Principles): 17 Ways Rich People Think & Act Differently. The scenarios outlined by the author are very interesting indeed.<br /><br />They key phrase I would single out from the foregoing is 'Think & Act Differently.' In fact, I would even add one more powerful word preceding the phrase as follows: 'See, Think & Act Differently.'<br /><br />Let me share this harsh reality: You can't do things differently until you see things differently.<br /><br />Anthony Robbins puts it very beautifully (at the Mastery University): \\"The difference between those who succeed & those who fail isn't what they have. It's what they choose to see & do with their resources & experiences of life.\\"<br /><br />This means all of us have a choice in life. So, exercise your power of choice. This is the vital key to wealth & abundance.<br /><br />To sum up my review, I must say, reading this book has been a refreshing exercise for me in spite of the slick factor & hyperbolic stuff. I will give it a rating of 4 for the practical insights as embodied in the 17 Rich People (See), Think & Act Differently.<br /><br />For readers who are seriously considering financial independence, I would strongly suggest you go for Joe Dominguez & Vicki Robin's book first. Then read this one & the others if you like. Best Wishes!bolic stuff. I will give it a rating of 4 for the practical insights as embodied in the 17 Rich People (See), Think & Act Differently.

0446677450|5.0|I bought this book because I heard a lot of talk and chit-chat about one man became rich by listening to two different dad's view on how they were raised to believe how money works. <br /> <br />I read this book and thought about how my parents view money, my mom and my dad. I can say this book does open my eyes and my view on how money was handled and managed differently between my dad and my mom. I notice some differences as well. <br /> <br />All I can say is read the book yourself and be your own judge in your own experience, be an observance, watch and listen what your feelings tell about your own world. This book might be the 'missing link' for you to your world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003OSU4|3.0|I appreciate the reviews in which it is suggested that viewers try to experience this film in a broader context--as a time capsule of an era. However, as an avid fan of Anita O'Day, I was deeply frustrated by the camera's focus on odd-looking (check out the chick eating the ice cream cone!), and apparently disinterested listeners in the audience, when the camera should have been focused on this amazing singer. Still, because O'Day--at the height of her sensuous form-- remains sadly undocumented on film, this is the best we've got.
0385336691|1.0|Past Reacher stories have featured a strong blend of action, mytstery, and good dectetive work. In this story there is absolutely no action until the last segment. There is some slight mystery in trying to figue if the person who hires Reacher is a victim or a villian. The answer becomes quite obvious wirh very little reading. This is by far the  weakest Racher story. The best use for this novel   is to \\"give it to someone you dislike.\\"
B0000028UK|5.0|As the years have passed, my tastes in music have changed, and as a result, PJ started to see less and less time in my stereo, finally falling completely off my radar screen as bands like Radiohead and other electronic-based rock really started to move music in a different direction. <br /> <br />Recently I just got offered tickets to the PJ show coming up touring their new disc, so I spent a long drive listening to all their discs.  I completely forgot how great this disc is.  There is not a bad track on this album, and it really exemplifies the grunge movement of the times.  The sound is distinctly Pearl Jam's, not some other band's, with Vedder agonizing over each syllable he sings and the music constantly moving with a purpose - there is an incredible sense of importance to the music.  Often PJ has been criticized for being over the top with their sense of importance, however, in this edition, the music with its unique sound easily carries the weight and gives you a sense rock really is not dead at all.   <br /> <br />It's hard to rate this disc in terms of where it stands with other PJ discs, simply due to the fact I think each of their albums has a different tone - let's just say this is less rock than Ten, but more refined than Vitalogy and a whole hell of a lot better than the self-titled one that just came out (although I've only listened to it once, first impression wasn't great) <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you're a new PJ fan, please go back and buy this album <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002KHY|4.0|These are all great tunes and for someone not fully engulfed in JT, this will do for the earlier years. My gripe is, some thirty plus years alter, the WB albums are still not remastered and sorely need to be. The CD versions are poorly done and the sound could be vastly improved with even a good EQ. Some bonus tracks and aremastering would be nothing short of ectasy for JT fans, of whom there are still many
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Many different feels, many different emotions are brought together in this wonderful set. Normally one album of good stuff in every 2 CD set from an artist - but this one has few odd songs.  I liked it and listen to it constantly these last few days.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee makes an excellent debut with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", a story that examines racial issues and other issues through the eyes of an 8-year-old tomboy named Scout Finch. Scout lives in the small town of Maycomb in Alabama. The novel examines her life and how she responds to large-scale issues and small, petty problems in her own life. This novel is more of a slice of life, with the main narrative problem and solution not coming until the end. <br /> <br />Scout Finch is 8 years old when the story begins. She spends most of her time acting out stories with her brother Jem and their beloved friend Dill. The trio also has a fascination with Boo Radley, a man who has evolved into an urban legend. The three make it their goal to make him leave his house. The book focuses on Scout's small worldview for the first half or so, how all she cares about is making Boo Radley come out and acting out plays in the summer. That all changes when her father, Atticus, decides to defend a young black man accused of rape. As racial issues and prejudices broaden Scout's view of things, we can only go along for the ride. <br /> <br />This is a true masterpiece, with excellent characters like Atticus and Dill, along with the youthful innocence of Scout. \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a classic, a read that truly depicts life in a way I had never experienced before.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The truth about this album is that it's extremely deep.  In fact, I'd say besides being this band's deepest album I'd say it's the deepest album I can think of right now off the top of my head.  By deep, I mean there are 28 songs, mostly all of which are very strong tracks, and standout tracks in their own respective ways.  I'll try to say something insightful about each track... <br /> <br />Note that I think theres a lot more going on on the second Disc (Mars).  I would describe the first disc as good and the second as nearly mind-blowing, and extremely solid.  <br /> <br />Dani California:  The Mary Jane's Last Dance parallel is uncanny.   When I first heard this song on the radio before the album dropped I remember turning to a friend in the car and saying this sounds a lot like Mary Jane's Last Dance.  Not sure what the deal is here.  I'd say that Frusciante probably heard the Tom Petty song shortly before coming up with the riff and that it was the work of the unconcsious, IF the lyrics and drum beat werent so similar too.  Not sure what else to say about this one.  Its a simple almost folky song with a simple drum beat that sets its tone.  I like the section in the middle where anthony and John sing in unison in real high pitch. <br /> <br />Snow:  This might be the catchiest song on the album and it definately was one of the first and easiest songs to grab me.  Now it sounds to me like one of the poppiest songs on the album.     Sounds to me like it could have easily fit into By The Way. <br /> <br />Charlie:  Strong song, not one of my faves, but I could see this one growing on me over the course of years. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium:  Very nice, one of the darker songs on the album, sung in a sad tone.  One of the cooler guitar solos on the album.  They use a cool, echoey, almost western-like effect for it.  Everytime I hear it I picture a western saloon for some reason (think Desperado) To me theres nothing super cool about this strack other than that solo. <br /> <br />Hump De Bump:  Fun song, don't listen to this one often, nothing i absolutely love about it right now. <br /> <br />She's Only 18:  This one's the standout of the first disc for me.  One of the best songs on the album.  Arguably the best chorus on the album.  So heavy, a little slow but urgent.  This guitar solo works the best of any track because the segue into the last chorus is seemless and amazing.  Amazing transition there, listen for it, it makes the whole song.  Also love Keidis' playful bird-sounding \\"haha\\" in the middle of the solo.   <br /> <br />Slow Cheetah:  Acoustic ballad, not crazy about the chorus, kind of sounds cheesy to me.  I wish they would have done soemthing more with it.  <br /> <br />Torure Me:  Fast drum beat, decent song, nothing really stands out for me to make me love it. <br /> <br />Strip My Mind:  One of the slowest paced songs on the album.  Nice chorus.  The song works.  What cool is this is a track where the whole band sings in unison for parts of it.  Kinda cool, theres a couple like that i think. Cant imagine hearing this live though. <br /> <br />Especially In Michigan:  I've heard people say that this album's lyrics are pointless and meaningless.  I completely disagree with this and love the poetry thru the whole thing but this song is probably a testamate for those reviews.  Other than making a reference to the Detroit Lions and Tigers (kinda cool), the lyrics dont mean much...but they work, and to me they are just random observations about the state where Kiedis and Chad Smith grew up.  As far as the song goes, to me this is another stand out of the disc.  I love the chorus here.  Its very interesting, distorted and sounds like there might be 2 or 3 voices chanting the distortion, but it might also just be frusciante.  Who knows.  Very cool. <br /> <br />Warlocks:  I dont care much for this one.  Theres just not enough going on with it.  One thing thats cool though is theres a verse in the middle that stands out because it sounds so different (\\"Make a deal with...\\")  Its very cool and sounds to me like something off of Dark Side of the Moon.   <br /> <br />C'Mon Girl:  Arghhhh.  This songs not bad at all, nice guitar riff and a cool baseline, BUT the chorus absolutely bludgeons this one for me.  It just doesnt fit the song, and I'd say it even ruins it for me, making the song almost intolerable.  Wish they would have done something with the Chorus. <br /> <br />Wet Sand:  Heres a song that really evolves and has an energy that slowly builds throughout the whole song.  This is an example of one of many very creative tracks on this album that shows lots of versatility by containing sections that sound somewhat different, or extrapalate on eachother.  The Chorus is amazing.    Theres a point about 2/3 the way through the song right when the second chorus kicks in that is the absolute climax of this song.  Theres a swooshy, space-like sound effect and then the chorus kicks in, but unlike the first chorus, this one has another sound effect thats really cool and continues throughout the entire chorus, underlying everything and changing tone all along.  Its very discreet and you have to listen for it.  Not sure why I love this so much but, just adds energy I think.   Probably something Rubin threw in to add character.  Nice ending too. <br /> <br />Hey:  Not much to say about this one.  Kind of a lame chorus.  Good placement of this song because its successor is one of the stars of the album... <br /> <br />Desecration Smile:  Ohhhh yea, this song is a total emotional rollercoaster.  Its a somber, its joyous, its reflective.  All around just an extemely versatile and well composed piece. It starts out sounding like it's going to be a fluid ballad but about 20 seconds in it takes a drastic turn and the mood is set.  Kiedis vocals here are like nothing we've heard from him before (sung in such high pitch)  He sounds a lot like Neil Young from CSNY times.  Keidis' volcals hereare a major and crucial component of this song, but I'd say everything else is as important.  Everyone comes to play here.  Nice picking guitar work by fruciante. <br /> <br />Tell Me Baby:  Another gem on the album.  Totally cool track.  Lots of personality, great representation of this band.  Cool theme about the motives of 20-somethings that move out to LA searching for something they cant even put their finger on.   Nice rapping section in the middle.  Very versatile track, very nice chorus.  Overall extremely solid and I hope this DOES NOT become a single because I would hate for this to be overplayed and I generally steer away from songs designated for radio play (maybe for no reason at all, but I do) <br /> <br />Hard to Concentrate:  I think a lot of people really like this one, and personally I dont get it at all.  Probably one  of the 4 or 5 tracks I might dump if I were forced to cut the album down some.  Nice poem,  too schmoozy though. <br /> <br />21st Century:  An absolute standout for me.  Keidis' vocals dominate the whole song, and Fruciante brings the A-game.  Very dancable song with lots of energy.  Amazing chorus, amazing basework, Chad is solid on the drums, nice guitar solo closing it out.   <br /> <br />She Looks to Me:  Another stand out track for me.  This just works, dont know why i like it, kind of reminds me of early 90's rock.  Contains maybe my favorite verse on the album (\\"down in the south seas...\\")  So different than the rest of the track.  Cool lyrics here too.   I mean really, how much better can the album get from here???  LOTS... <br /> <br />Readymade:   Ohhhhhh man, I mean they keep bringing it track after track on this disc.  One of a handful of total gems on the album.  Hard rocking song from the start, a serious rocker, love the backround \\"ahhhhhh\\" vocals from the rest of the band behind Keidis' voice in the chorus. <br /> <br />If:  sounds like a slower phish song to me.  kind of a reflective song.  Cool electric sound effect underlying the entire song.  I'd consider this the breather of the second disc.  Some might say its a refreshing brake from the insanity and strength of the songs preceding and before they close the album out with another bundle of solid brilliance, others might consider this a break in the momentum. <br /> <br />Make You Feel Better:  Cool song about, well... I'll leave that one up to you.  Love Keidis' periodic \\"oh yea\\" high-pitch scream here.  If he didnt scream it I probably would.   <br /> <br />Animal Bar:  One of the most complex songs on the album.  It does different things.  It moves, it changes.  Grew on me the most.  Love the chorus (\\"rain on my...\\") and the \\"babadaba\\" in the background.  Crazy twist at the end and fizzles out... <br /> <br />So Much I:   how solid can this disc possibly be???  They are still bringing it with variance and full force here.  Like about 20 other songs on the album, this one has its own unique charater and sound thats nothing like the others.  Srong track. <br /> <br />Storm in a Teacup:  One of the gems, love the verse building up to both choruses \\"little lady love youre gonna make some\\"  brilliant structure of words and just well written.  This is almost beastie-boys meets RHCP.  You can hear the Rubin element here.  Energetic all the way through, but certain parts ooze enery, particularly when  it gets real quiet before the last chorus section and to me this sounds a lot like something off Check Your Head (an album i think rubin produced; not sure of this though)  Its got an extraordinary quality to it, great song.    <br /> <br />We Beleive:  Not sure what he deal is with this one, its definately the message of the album though.  I think its the band speaking directly to the album, almost a refleection from them.  I could be dead wrong.  Nice santana-ish guitar effect.  Cool lyrics.  \\"The risk is, it worth it, The disc is, it perfect?\\"  I'll let you answer that one.  Very cool distortion over Keidis' words to fade thetrack out.  <br /> <br />Turn it Again:  Huge rocker, very loud, led by somewhat distorted  heavy electric guitar.  This one is reminiscent of GunsnRoses for me, particularly toward the end.  Very heavy, very distrorted, similar sound. <br /> <br />Death of a Martian: Def a gem of the album, perfect closer, like nothing theyve ever done before.  Kind of trippy sound.  The song kind of trickles downward the whole time.  Some of the best lyrics on the album.  Very cool ending poem with some of the coolest lyrics I've ever heard in song.  Keidis ends the album on  a somewhat screaming \\"AWAAAAAAAAY\\" love it.  Great song to listen to while you reflect on what you just heard and its sad only because the album has come to an end.  Oh well, time to Turn it Again... <br /> <br /> <br />In closing I'd say there is definitely enough here to keep someone busy for a while and this is a truly expansive album.   <br /> <br />Thanks.
B00005JOVN|3.0|WARNING: SPOILERS!!<br /><br />Yes, I'm a fan of the original Irwin Allen film.<br />Yes, I have been on a couple of cruises.<br />Yes, I have seen James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\".<br />Yes, I can hum \\"The Morning After.\\"<br /><br />With those facts behind me, I can now embark on my take on Wolfgang Peterson's retelling of the '72 disaster classic.<br /><br />Shortening the original by almost an hour, Peterson's version delves sparingly into the lives of the stars and \\"dives\\" headfirst into the \\"adventure\\" for survival.  Perhaps, by having two familiar faces, Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss, the director wants the audience to fill in the blanks about their respective characters.  Russell's is possibly an extension of the character that he played in \\"Backdraft\\" inasmuch as in this film he's a former New York firefighter turned mayor; Dreyfus is, perhaps, \\"Matt Hooper\\" from \\"Jaws,\\" after the great white scared him out of the closet.  Both actors didn't seem to stretch their acting muscles much in this film.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, Josh Lucas's \\"reformation\\" from professional gambler to savior of the group is almost believable, considering the predicament in which the survivors find themselves.  Though he has more lines than original \\"captain\\" Leslie Neilson, Andre Braugher doesn't get too much screen time and \\"goes down with the ship,\\"...literally.<br /><br />Because of the brevity of character development, the rest of the cast is filled out with your basic stereotypes: the single mom and son (Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett), the young couple (Emmy Rossum and Mike Vogel), the stowaway (Mia Maestro), the wise-ass (Kevin Dillon), and the noble crewman (Freddy Rodriquez).<br /><br />The special effects are indeed spectacular but more than thirty years have passed since the first film and it's logical that there would be an improvement in that area.  However, the first one benefited from having characters of whom the audience could connect.  By going \\"straight for the jugular\\" with the massive effort spent on CGI effects and stuntwork, Peterson has crafted a nice-looking package but with nothing inside.<br /><br />And even the original had a nifty John Williams' score; Klaus Bedelt's does not compare, even to his own superlative score to the hit \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\\"<br /><br />The film does have one great bonus: the sinking of the ship at the film's end.  That is a most likely occurence, considering the massive damage inflicted on the ship by the \\"rogue wave.\\"t spent on CGI effects and stuntwork, Peterson has crafted a nice-looking package but with nothing inside.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|In the world we live in today, people have begun to let themselves grow out of their prejudice and restricted standard of living to become open, accepting people. There are, however, a few people who are not ready for the progress, and hence leave negative reviews about this movie.    Brokeback Mountain is a fantastic movie about two men hopelessly in love in an oppressive time. This movie is a significant step towards a free world, but it alone is not enough. It would take a lot more masterpieces like these before everyone is ready to accept the movie, and the Oscar Board to nominated a movie featuring same-gender love. Bombing angry letters on review board is not going to do anyone any favor.    Just mark that comment as inappropriate, and let it be done with that. There is no reason to lose your cool over a stupid comment.
B000002LMK|5.0|In 1990 ,Neil young decided to create a sound which many Seattle bands were playing in the Northwest. <br />The result is absolutely Jaw-Dropping of a Album , Ragged Glory.Friends listen to this album, and you will wonder, why is this thing not continuing in the 21ST Century.. I mean, look at us now, What direction are we going Musically..Absolutely nothing and No -where. The DEAD NU-METAL was crappy enough which better less said the better. <br />I take out all my past \\"GRUNGE\\" Collection out, and listen to it, wondering  whether kids of Todays generation are able to enjoy this music..Bad luck if they Arent. <br />RAGGED GLORY has TWO \\"LOVE\\" Songs well past 8 Minute mark which will make this album worth having. <br />Ajewel in my GRUNGE Collection.GET IT
B000E41MS6|5.0|I've been going through the other reviews... and not being a Dr. Who expert (I remember seeing the old ones here and there on PBS as a kid) anything I say will have been said already. What I will say is I love it... and can't wait for the Series One DVD to come out here in the States.<br /><br />I think my favorite part about this is that they DIDN'T go over the top with special effects (which is what would have happened if an American company had gotten ahold of the idea to remake it). I'm glad the creatures are a little on the low-fi side... not all super CGI'd up. It would have ruined the whole thing. ... its the kitsch that makes this show so fun!
B000FC2FVA|4.0|Although United and Alphabetical had several great moments, they failed to create what this new album does. This is Phoenix's first really great \\"album.\\" Meaning that every song is as good as the next and they melt together to create an unbelievable set of songs. This seems to me to be more of a straight forward poppy rock album, every track can be danced to. From start to finish this is by far superior to their past work (which I also love) and it should be listened to by anyone who liked their older stuff. This to me is just the perfect rock album right now. This is by far one of the best albums I have heard in recent memory.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|First of all, I think it's brave, if not bold, to launch your \\"comeback\\" with a double album. Most artists after a four year hiatus would have played it safe, but the fact that the Chili Peppers took a risk deserves special attention. \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" certainly qualifies as a collector's item because most double or single albums won't even approach this level of good. This is the kind of project that a great band should be capable of making this late into their career and the Red Hot Chili Peppers don't disappoint. From the moment you hear the first song \\"Dani California,\\" you're hooked. It reminds you of what has made this band so popular throughout the years.  And that's just the beginning.  Surprisingly, the album just keeps getting better. Most double albums would have collapsed halfway through the first set, but not this one. It's almost hard to appreciate both CD's just merely playing your favorites. When playing both disks straight through, that's when the greatness really hits you. \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" is almost overwhelming, but in a good way. It's hard to absorb it all. But that's a compliment. There's just so much good material. I wouldn't consider any song filler. I definitely think this is a big improvement over \\"By the Way.\\" The Red Hot Chili Peppers have clearly evolved and for the better. It's almost hard for me to properly describe \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" I just think you have to experience it for any of this to be meaningful. This work is probably destined to become a future classic and with good reason. No one should be able to make a small masterpiece look this easy.
0780622553|2.0|The movie has great sets, and is kind of a mix between matrix and blade runner. However the acting is unconvincing, the big secret is revealed at the beginning, and the character development is weak.
B000068UXF|4.0|Before the DVD, I listened to Solti's CD. I liked it very much at first, and the more I listened to it, the more I loved it. I followed the libretto and I imagined a very fantastic kind of opera with lots of sets and coulours. <br /> <br />I thought that Studer made a very good Empress, better than Varady. I turn on the DVD instead of the CD when I want to listen to the Empress in particular. Her acting is not very good, however. Most of the time she has a confused open-mouthed expression, as if she had no idea why she was on stage. One thing to note is that she cut out most of the spoken text in the third act, not that it's important but it's strange to see a bad actor conveying internal conflict without words. When Empress gets her shadow, a very bright beam shines through her skirt and you can't help noticing what huge legs she has. <br /> <br />I'll agree with other reviewers on Lipovsek. I was surprised by her excellent acting, she exhibited a whole range of emotions. She would stoop at times, and even swagger too. The only problem is in Act III, when she's misdirecting Barak and Wife. She moves her head around a lot and it seems like the mic doesn't catch everything clearly. Although she isn't as constant and Runkel, I really did enjoy her interpretation. <br /> <br />I don't like Marton's voice. It seems devoid of any delicacy. Here too, she screams most of her lines. They're accompanied with a ton of facial contortions. To make matters worse, the high notes don't even come out right. You can barely tell them apart because her vibrato is so wobbly. It's most notable at the end of the quartet in Act III, where she and Studer don't even sing the same note. Her acting is fun to watch though. For example, her reaction to the screaming fish is hilarious. She even starts crying at Act III. At least Behrens had the prerequisite vocal range, though I never really know what to think of her interpretations because her voice and singing seem so unusual. <br /> <br />Hale looks frail, but his singing is satisfactory. He's thin so you can see the bulging veins on his neck... a bit distracting. His acting was fine too, except he doesn't look very menacing when he's treatening the Wife. During Act III, he's stuck on the right side of the stage, sulking adorably. <br /> <br />Moser has the best costume! His singing is really light compared to Domingo. During the quartets and duets, it's especially noticeable. The huge bags under his eyes and his facial contortions give him an ever-changing mask. It's awkward and distracting. I don't think the role of the Emperor requires a lot of acting anyway. <br /> <br />Terfel as one of the messengers is very good. He's floating in a corner at the begining, which is really not how I pictured the scene. His make up doesn't make sense to me either. Another weird one is the female messenger; she looks absurd. The falcon is just a mass of red flesh that doesn't move at all. The chorus is really excellent though. <br /> <br />The staging was the most disappointing part. The stage is vast yet the sets are painfully diminutive. The scene where Nurse first tempts Barak's Wife with the crown is the only one that's impressive. The last act was the worst. There's no scene change during the Empress and Emperor's descent; instead they just hang out on stage, smiling and moving about aimlessly. Then, when I saw Studer \\"pull out\\" Marton's shadow from a roll on the ground, I was simiply shocked. And then no golden bridge materialized, Barak and Barak's wife just walk on her \\"shadow\\". That was absolutely ridiculous, what self-respecting singer would agree to move the set, during a performance, and in front of the audience? What they did to create the golden spring was so pathetic: two plastic cylinder filled with water and air bubbles coming up. Also the spirit messenger here looks like a singing rectangle. Why??? Barak's sword turned out to be a cheap looking lightsabre wannabe. The lighting wasn't good either. You can barely see Marton's face during the end of Act II. Also when Barak and his Wife are looking for each other, there's an awkward \\"searchlight\\" effect going on. The last scene with the chorus of unborn children is also very weird. I don't know who they paid to the background, but it looks so dumb! There's raw wooden paneling on the extremities and it looks out of place when the performers are there. I didn't like how they handled the broom bit. The \\"handsome\\" fellow Wife met on a bridge is terrifying. He looks very bright and metallic. The special effects for the Nurse's magic tricks aren't spectacular. It's hard to see the fish flying and the bed breaking happens in the dark. <br /> <br />So in the end, this is a good DVD. The singing and conducting is worthwhile, even if the visual aspect doesn't contribute much.
B000AYELVA|5.0|A great movie for those who did follow the comics and those who did not.  The actors did well taking on the personalities of the characters.  Worth adding to your collection.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|I'm not really a fan of the comic book or video game based movies, however, \\"Resident Evil\\" is one thrilling movie.  The story line is well put together and original for the most part (ok, so there are zombies, past that though...) <br /> <br />The sequel to \\"Resident Evil\\" I think makes this movie even better and you should definately watch both, in order.  While Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigues might be type-cast, they certainly deliever when it counts. <br /> <br />Those who play and know the video game I'm sure will like the movie even more then the uniniated such as myself, but do not let that stop you from see this surprisingly good movie.
B000E41MS6|5.0|What can one say about the \\"new\\" Doctor Who series that hasn't been said. If you grew up watching classic Who then this season will not disappoint you. Face it; we like watching the Doctor travel through time battling old and new enemies alike because deep down inside we want to be like the Doctor. The writing is superb contrary to another reviewers opinion. The special effects are great. My one complaint is that we can't watch season two yet in the US. Get the set, you won't regret it. It is absolutely fantastic!
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles are the greatest band ever.They are great,terrific,excellent and superb.Each and every song on this album is a classic.Get this with Abbey road.Highly recommended.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The truth about this album is that it's extremely deep. In fact, I'd say besides being this band's deepest album I'd say it's the deepest album I can think of right now off the top of my head. By deep, I mean there are 28 songs, mostly all of which are very strong tracks, and standout tracks in their own respective ways. I'll try to say something insightful about each track... <br /> <br />Note that I think theres a lot more going on on the second Disc (Mars). I would describe the first disc as good and the second as nearly mind-blowing, and extremely solid. <br /> <br />Dani California: The Mary Jane's Last Dance parallel is uncanny. When I first heard this song on the radio before the album dropped I remember turning to a friend in the car and saying this sounds a lot like Mary Jane's Last Dance. Not sure what the deal is here. I'd say that Frusciante probably heard the Tom Petty song shortly before coming up with the riff and that it was the work of the unconcsious, IF the lyrics and drum beat werent so similar too. Not sure what else to say about this one. Its a simple almost folky song with a simple drum beat that sets its tone. I like the section in the middle where anthony and John sing in unison in real high pitch. <br /> <br />Snow: This might be the catchiest song on the album and it definately was one of the first and easiest songs to grab me. Now it sounds to me like one of the poppiest songs on the album. Sounds to me like it could have easily fit into By The Way. <br /> <br />Charlie: Strong song, not one of my faves, but I could see this one growing on me over the course of years. <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium: Very nice, one of the darker songs on the album, sung in a sad tone. One of the cooler guitar solos on the album. They use a cool, echoey, almost western-like effect for it. Everytime I hear it I picture a western saloon for some reason (think Desperado) To me theres nothing super cool about this strack other than that solo. <br /> <br />Hump De Bump: Fun song, don't listen to this one often, nothing i absolutely love about it right now. <br /> <br />She's Only 18: This one's the standout of the first disc for me. One of the best songs on the album. Arguably the best chorus on the album. So heavy, a little slow but urgent. This guitar solo works the best of any track because the segue into the last chorus is seemless and amazing. Amazing transition there, listen for it, it makes the whole song. Also love Keidis' playful bird-sounding \\"haha\\" in the middle of the solo. <br /> <br />Slow Cheetah: Acoustic ballad, not crazy about the chorus, kind of sounds cheesy to me. I wish they would have done soemthing more with it. <br /> <br />Torure Me: Fast drum beat, decent song, nothing really stands out for me to make me love it. <br /> <br />Strip My Mind: One of the slowest paced songs on the album. Nice chorus. The song works. What cool is this is a track where the whole band sings in unison for parts of it. Kinda cool, theres a couple like that i think. Cant imagine hearing this live though. <br /> <br />Especially In Michigan: I've read reviews on here criticizing this album for it's pointless and meaningless lyrics. I completely disagree with this and love the poetry thru the whole thing but this song is probably a testamate for those reviews. Other than making a reference to the Detroit Lions and Tigers (kinda cool), the lyrics dont mean much...but they work, and to me they are just random observations about the state where Kiedis and Chad Smith grew up. As far as the song goes, to me this is another stand out of the disc. I love the chorus here. Its very interesting, distorted and sounds like there might be 2 or 3 voices chanting the distortion, but it might also just be frusciante. Who knows. Very cool. <br /> <br />Warlocks: I dont care much for this one. Theres just not enough going on with it. One thing thats cool though is theres a verse in the middle that stands out because it sounds so different (\\"Make a deal with...\\") Its very cool and sounds to me like something off of Dark Side of the Moon. <br /> <br />C'Mon Girl: Arghhhh. This songs not bad at all, nice guitar riff and a cool baseline, BUT the chorus absolutely ruinsthis one for me. It just doesnt fit the song, and I'd say it even makes the song almost intolerable. Wish they would have done something with the Chorus. <br /> <br />Wet Sand: Heres a song that really evolves and has an energy that slowly builds throughout the whole song. This is an example of one of many very creative tracks on this album that shows lots of versatility by containing sections that sound somewhat different, or extrapalate on eachother. The Chorus is amazing. Theres a point about 2/3 the way through the song right when the second chorus kicks in that is the absolute climax of this song. Theres a swooshy, space-like sound effect and then the chorus kicks in, but unlike the first chorus, this one has another sound effect thats really cool and continues throughout the entire chorus, underlying everything and changing tone all along. Its very discreet and you have to listen for it. Not sure why I love this so much but, just adds energy I think. Probably something Rubin threw in to add character. Nice ending too. <br /> <br />Hey: Not much to say about this one. Kind of a lame chorus. Good placement of this song because its successor is one of the stars of the album... <br /> <br />Desecration Smile: Ohhhh yea, this song is a total emotional rollercoaster. Its a somber, its joyous, its reflective. All around just an extemely versatile and well-composed piece. It starts out sounding like it's going to be a fluid ballad but about 20 seconds in it takes a drastic turn and the mood is set. Kiedis vocals here are like nothing we've heard from him before (sung in such high pitch) He sounds a lot like Neil Young from CSNY times. Keidis' volcals here are a major and crucial component of this song, but I'd say everything else is as important. Everyone comes to play here. Nice picking guitar work by fruciante. <br /> <br />Tell Me Baby: Another gem on the album. Totally cool track. Lots of personality, great representation of this band. Cool theme about the motives of 20-somethings that move out to LA searching for something they cant even put their finger on. Nice rapping section in the middle. Very versatile track, very nice chorus. Overall extremely solid and I hope this DOES NOT become a single because I would'nt want this to be overplayed and lose its unique quality. <br /> <br />Hard to Concentrate: I think a lot of people really like this one, and personally I dont get it at all. Probably one of the 4 or 5 tracks I might dump if I were forced to cut the album down some. Nice poem, too schmoozy though. <br /> <br />21st Century: An absolute standout for me. Keidis' vocals dominate the whole song, and Fruciante brings the A-game. Very dancable song with lots of energy. Amazing chorus, amazing basework, Chad is solid on the drums, nice guitar solo closing it out. <br /> <br />She Looks to Me: Another stand out track for me. This just works, dont know why i like it, kind of reminds me of early 90's rock. Contains maybe my favorite verse on the album (\\"down in the south seas...\\") So different than the rest of the track. Cool lyrics here too. I mean really, how much better can the album get from here??? LOTS... <br /> <br />Readymade: Ohhhhhh man, I mean they keep bringing it track after track on this disc. One of a handful of total gems on the album. Hard rocking song from the start, a serious rocker, love the backround \\"ahhhhhh\\" vocals from the rest of the band behind Keidis' voice in the chorus. <br /> <br />If: sounds like a slower phish song to me. kind of a reflective song. Cool electric sound effect underlying the entire song. I'd consider this the breather of the second disc. Some might say its a refreshing break from the insanity and strength of the songs preceding and before they close the album out with another bundle of solid brilliance, others might consider this a break in the momentum. <br /> <br />Make You Feel Better: Cool song about, well... I'll leave that one up to you. Love Keidis' periodic \\"oh yea\\" high-pitch scream here. If he didnt scream it I probably would. <br /> <br />Animal Bar: One of the most complex songs on the album. It does different things. It moves, it changes. Grew on me the most. Love the chorus (\\"rain on my...\\") and the \\"babadaba\\" in the background. Crazy twist at the end and fizzles out... <br /> <br />So Much I: Oh man, how solid can this disc possibly be??? They are still bringing it with variance and full force here. Like about 20 other songs on the album, this one has its own unique charater and sound thats nothing like the others. Srong track. <br /> <br />Storm in a Teacup: One of the gems, love the verse building up to both choruses \\"little lady love youre gonna make some\\" brilliant structure of words and just well written. This is almost beastie-boys meets RHCP. You can hear the Rubin element here. Energetic all the way through, but certain parts ooze enery, particularly when it gets real quiet before the last chorus section and to me this sounds a lot like something off Check Your Head (an album i think rubin produced; not sure of this though) Its got an extraordinary quality to it, great song. <br /> <br />We Beleive: Not sure what he deal is with this one, its definately the message of the album though. I think its the band speaking directly to the album, almost a refleection from them. I could be dead wrong. Nice santana-ish guitar effect. Cool lyrics. \\"The risk is, it worth it, The disc is, it perfect?\\" I'll let you answer that one. Very cool distortion over Keidis' words to fade the track out. <br /> <br />Turn it Again: Huge rocker, very loud, led by somewhat distorted heavy electric guitar. This one is reminiscent of GunsnRoses for me, particularly toward the end. Very heavy, very distrorted, similar sound.<br /> <br />Death of a Martian: Def a gem of the album, perfect closer, like nothing theyve ever done before. Kind of trippy sound. The song kind of trickles downward the whole time. Some of the best lyrics on the album. Very cool ending poem with some of the coolest lyrics I've ever heard in song. Keidis ends the album on a somewhat screaming \\"AWAAAAAAAAY\\" love it. Great song to listen to while you reflect on what you just heard and its sad only because the album has come to an end. Oh well, time to turn it again... <br /> <br /> <br />In closing I'd say there is definately enough here to keep someone busy for a while and the depth is amazing. Let me know if this review was helpful and/or if you guys agree with my commentary. <br /> <br />Thanks.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|WELL,ENOUGH OF THE STUPID IDIOTS WHO HATE GREAT BANDS LIKE THE BEATLES,LED ZEPPELIN AND THE ROLLING STONES.The Beatles are amongst the greatest,best and a classic band of all time.And this compilation contains gems like A hard day's night,from me to you,we can work it out and more.You got to have this in your cd collection.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWERS AND AVOID ALBUMS FROM OVERRATED CRAPPY BANDS LIKE GREEN DAY,NIRVANA AND FOREIGNER.

B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles are the greatest band ever after the stones and this is their best album.Very very very highly recommended.
6302886228|2.0|While I agree it was a fantastic concert (I was lucky enough to be there) the VHS tape & the CD wars very disappointing for the reasons I am about to write.  <br /> <br />They didn't include the entire concert and I was also very disappointed in the Mixing. For example, when George Harrison first came out, he sang \\"If Not For You\\"-where is that song on the Video and CD? Was it a mistake? I am also disappointed in the Mixing--they (Columbia) made it way too \\"commercial\\" in that the rawness of the music is missing. For example, towards the end of the song \\"My Back Pages\\" (a highlight of the Concert) Neil Young sang the final \\"Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now\\" as a solo. They kept the camera on him but when you hear the rest of the people singing-it looks and sounds strange. If they ever put this out on DVD, I hope they won't mess with it too much. Just leave it alone, as when you mess with something as magical as this you loose most of its authenticity.
B00004Y6NV|1.0|One of every street is the worst dire straits album.Heavy fuel is a awful joke of a song.The good album s from Dire straits are their DEBUT,BROTHERS IN ARMS and LOVE OVER GOLD albums.Avoid this and got those albums instead.
B0006SNK9E|5.0|Back in the 70's I was in a band called ACTION and we covered the Sweet song of the same name. We were all Sweet fans and actually got to meet the band and I have a photo of drummer Mick Tucker and me. The band was good when they were doing the bubblegum thing but were even better when they got heavier. I have this release on vinyl and I would easily recommend it. Tracks like SWEET F.A., SET ME FREE and HEARTBREAK TODAY lead the charge and the band is in fine form. These guys can rock! Their 4 part vocal harmonies were always superb and were one of the highlights of the band for me. In their day this was a very good band. I'd rather listen to this than a lot of the stuff that is out there today. R.I.P. Mick Tucker.<br /><br />[...]
B000000W5N|5.0|Well everyone likes the stones.They are the GREATEST band of all time along with LED ZEPPELIN and THE BEATLES.This classic album has anthems like Brown sugar.You got to have this along with Beggars banquet.

B00006AW2S|5.0|The rolling stones are my favourite band and satisfaction is my favourite rock song which I could listen to a billion times.hugely recommended with all the other albums from the stones.
B000067DNC|5.0|I really have fallen in love with this series. Season one was great, but everything has gotten even better! The story; the action, the new characters and races, it is all fantastic! I love how every episode in this great series always reveals more and more with almost every episode, and it does it again in this season. Almost every episode is great, but there are a few that are just average. I highly recommend this season to all SG fans. It really is wonderful
B000F0UV0E|5.0|The second time ...  what is this; folk , pop , where is  rock please. The eleven time ... i buy it, not very convince. Now is in mine car, and this for any singer suppose an honour, i think ; right now this is us, rollin' on beachcombing.
B0007OASII|4.0|Kamelot have continued to mature with Khan on vocals over their last few records. This addition to their armoury is a very good release and the equal of anything they've done before, adding a range of skills and maturity to their previous works.<br /><br />The album kicks off with March of Mephisto which is a great, heavy rabble rouser of a track with a rolling drum sound that sounds like the percussion was recorded in a cavern somewhere. And that's meant in a nice way in this instance.<br /><br />Track two continues barnstorming along - it's fast paced all the way and with a fully body to it with fine vocals by Khan. Things don't slow down for track 3 (The Haunting) which is full of interesting movements, mellow sections and some female vocal melodies that sound, indeed, haunted.<br /><br />The fourth track moves along brilliantly as well with excellent vocals with lots of timbre evident in Khans' still maturing voice and the whole track is steeped in dynamics.<br /><br />And that's just the first four tracks folks!<br /><br />Later tracks utilise Latin language sections, atmospheric patches that actually work and the whole record is a resounding realisation of the Kamelot manifesto.<br /><br />Production wise this is as good as you'd expect, a full bodied sound that surrounds the listener and everything about the package is well thought out right down to another excellent, evocative slice of cover art.<br /><br />The tracks unfold well and for Euro metal (yeah yeah I know they're a US band but apart from Savatage have you ever come across a US band that sounded so much like a Euro metal mob) and utlimately there is not a total reliance on double time drumming, a major drawback of much of this genre. By not falling into that trap of going for speed and therefore actually losing power - or gravitas if you will - Kamelot have played perhaps their ace card.<br /><br />Overall, with the lush production, excellent tunes and good but appropriate use of keyboards, which lightly wash over tracks like This Pain (track 7) and judicious use of string elements on tunes like Moonlight this is a fine, fine record. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Any downsides are these - firstly this record is a touch self important. It's also a touch long. The use of rather intriguing interlude tracks do break the whole thing up which is useful for the listener, but really, listening to this many tracks is perhaps asking a bit much of an audience, when they could so easily have levelled the place with a round dozen tunes.keyboards, which lightly wash over tracks like This Pain (track 7) and judicious use of string elements on tunes like Moonlight this is a fine, fine record.

0875428940|3.0|I had a roommate once who had the Robin Wood deck. It had been a while since I'd seen the images, but I decided to check it out, perhaps with the memory of my roommate in mind, who was a very sweet person. When looking over this deck I remembered what I'd liked, and didn't like about it.<br /><br />I like the fact that the images are lively, plus the minor arcana is fully illustrated and has a definite Pagan feel. Also, the cards have very attractive backs, a lovely green Celtic knot design. (For some reason, the backs are important to me to consider in deck selection).  However...<br /><br />One reviewer here described the artwork as something from a Jehovah's Witness tract. I really have to agree with that. The images are very perky and cartoonish for the most part. Some of the people in the cards I find to be just plain creepy...the Fool and the Chariot come to mind, although there are others.<br />Over all I find the cards to be somewhat of a turnoff.<br /><br />That being said, there are lots of folks who this deck appeals to, for its heavy Wiccan/Pagan symbolism AND the happy, happy expressions on most of the cards. (Even the High Priestess is smiling...very strange to me, but perhaps comforting to some!). I think of my old roommate when I think of these cards, who was a very upbeat, happy person, but also could be serious at times, and was by no means a fluffy Wiccan wannabe. So in no way am I *condemning* the Robin Wood Deck. It just will not appeal to everyone, myself included.<br /><br />Anyone considering this deck should try to look carefully at as many images as you can before purchasing. For me, the deck was not an immediate turnoff until I started flipping through, then the strange weirdness (to me) of it started to come through. Others, obviously have a different reaction. Which is why it's always a good idea to get as much info about a deck as possible before purchase, not just to rely on reviews such as this one.

B0000033RY|5.0|Even though I have all the albums that these cuts came off of, this is a great collection. I would have picked most of the same songs if I was putting it together. I wish that live album that was released a while back wasn't so hard to get and expensive, but that may change because these guys are back together. They are playing NYC and a rock festival in Europe in June and are going to release a new album soon. The original band is back, with the exception of Rusty Day who was murdered in the 1980's. Appice and Bogart have been touring with athe original Vanilla Fudge lately and Jim McCartey has been keeping his chops hot playing in local Detroit bars for the past 25 years. I don't think these guys realize the fan base that is out there, and once they do we should be getting a lot more touring and product out of them so we can make sure these guys die rich old men. Damn, life does get better as you age!!!  Rock on Cactus!!!
B000002J1U|4.0|Led Zeppelin comes through with another fantastic album. III is known for showing the band's mellow side. Jimmy Page really shows off his ability to play the acoustic guitar on this album. \\"Friends\\" \\"Tangerine\\" \\"That's The Way\\" \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" all display this new sound.  <br /> <br />There is still standard rock fare on this album with the radio staple \\"Immigrant Song\\", and others such as \\"Celebration Day\\", \\"Out On The Tiles\\". \\"Gallows Pole\\" should actually be considered amongst the acoustic songs but it really doesn't fit amongst them. It's a great, and often over-looked song. Bonham's drums coupled with Plant's vocals really make this song special. <br /> <br />My strongest recommendations are: \\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" \\"Gallows Pole\\" and \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\"  <br /> <br />Overall, I don't think this should be the first Led Zeppelin album one buys. It's not the most accessible of their works because of the mixture of hard and soft tunes. This album is probably my least favorite because of the soft fare, but I still give it 4 stars. You really can't go wrong with any Led Zeppelin album.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|It may be that that in the future, the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven will be cited as one of those pivotal films that underscored the drawbacks of producing certain screenplays within the restrictions required for theatres. Some stories are simply too rich and complex to capture as they deserve to be told within the compressed timeslot that a theatre presentation dictates. This is one of those stories. <br /> <br />Thanks to the skill of Ridley as a director and that of his entire production team and cast, the theatre cut was in itself a feast for the senses. Still it necessitated paring the finished film down to essentially just what had to be told to keep the main story unfolding, so sprawling was the historical tapestry that had been captured in this screenplay and shot during production.  <br /> <br />Anyone who sees both the theatre release and the Director's Cut will appreciate what was sacrificed and which so vibrantly brings to life the characters you barely had time to get to know in the former version. The latter's rich complexity of restored sub-plots draws you - as it was always intended to - right into Ridley's compelling storytelling of the world of 12th century France and the Crusades.  <br /> <br />However, if all you as a viewer want is a film that lets you take sides and cheer for the 'good guys', then you won't get what this story offers below all the wonderful pageantry and human drama. If there is one underlying message to this film, it is that you as the viewer need to and can go beyond the deceptive simplicity of faceless stereotyping. When you comprehend Christians and Muslims as real people as they are so brilliantly depicted in the longer version of Kingdom of Heaven, then the utter futility of war for whatever reasons is resoundingly brought home.  <br /> <br />Combined with behind the scenes commentary and features on two additional disks, the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven Ridley is not merely a longer version of the theatre release but rather the version that in every way deserves to be considered the definitive telling of this epic story. <br />
B000002J03|5.0|With Led Zeppelin's second release they continue to amaze with more of the same old rock & blues mix that made them famous after their first release. While this album is strong, arguably stronger than their first album, it's still not as polished as their later efforts. If I could I'd give this album 4 1/2 stars as the current rating on Amazon provides. This is a fun album to listen to. It's accessible to a lot of listeners. It's probably Led Zeppelin's most popular release with radio hits such as \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Heartbreaker/Living Loving Maid\\". Overshadowed here is \\"Moby Dick\\" and \\"Bring It On Home\\". They are excellent songs. My personal favorite on the album is \\"Ramble On\\". It's not even close, actually.  <br /> <br />Listed here are my favorite songs in order of preference: <br /> <br />\\"Ramble On\\" <br />\\"Whole Lotta Love\\" <br />\\"Bring It On Home\\" <br />\\"Moby Dick\\" <br />\\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" <br />\\"Heartbreaker\\" <br />\\"Living Loving Maid\\" <br />\\"Lemon Song\\" <br />\\"Thank You\\" <br /> <br />If having never purchased a Led Zeppelin album before, I would start with this one. It's probably the most accessible, radio-friendly record they have released. <br />
B000E994KE|4.0|I recently bought this cd after hearing House of Sleep on knac.com.  This is a very good cd.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|The risk has payed off...the chili peppers have produced a stunning double album that i find it difficult to see how anyone could dislike after 4-5 listens. Unlike previous phenomenal albums, every song has something to hang it's hat on - very consistent.  <br /> <br />Dani California- 6.5/10- Close to the worst song on the album, and it's not even that bad. <br />Snow- 9/10- A better single. Very radio friendly and melodic. Frusciante begins his dominance. <br />Charlie- 9/10- Love the bass!! Could be another single. Guitar riff is memorable. <br />Stadium Arcadium- 8.5/10- Great song, Anthony is getting better with the vocals- just missing one extra gear towards the end. <br />Hump de Bump- 8/10- Every peppers album has one of these upbeat songs on it. A little repetitive but good fun. <br />She's Only 18- 8.5/10- The chorus is formidable. This song has attitude. <br />Slow Cheetah- 7/10- Verses are quite good, and lyrics moving, but i'm left wanting more in the chorus and general climax. <br />Torture Me- 9/10- Close to best song on album. Trumpets great, and sensational build up to last chorus. Fasten seat-belt. <br />Strip My Mind- 8/10- Very solid. Anthony has definately improved. <br />Especially in Michigan- 8/10- Again very good. Good guitar here towards the end, but lyrics seem pointless. <br />Warlocks- 7.5/10- Good chorus and the combination of insturments shows the depth of the band. <br />C'mon Girl- 7/10- A good time in the disc for a fast tempo song, but chorus is quite one-dimensional. <br />Wet Sand- 9.5/10- Best song on the first disc. Frusciante at the end is some of the most well timed guitar i've ever heard. <br />Hey- 9/10- Very classy. Didn't know Anthony was capable of this one... <br /> <br />Desecration Smile- 8/10- Love the guitar at the start and end. Format could have been mixed up a bit more tho. <br />Tell Me Baby- 8.5/10- Could be a single. Cool chorus, guitar great quality. Not slowing down on the second disc at all yet. <br />HardTo Concentrate- 10/10- My favorite song on the album. The hair on the back of my neck stands up during solo in the middle of the song. A love song. Pure genius. <br />21st Century- 8/10- Fantastic guitar finish to a quality vocal performance. <br />She Looks to Me- 7/10- Beginning of a slight slump. Although still fairly decent song. Somethings missing here.  <br />Readymade- 7/10 Most people will understandably love this song's attitude, but my ears differ. <br />If- 6/10- Not too bad of a ballad, but this kind of stuff is best left to coldplay. <br />Make your Feel Better- 9/10- Flows fantastically. Reminds me of 'Friends' theme song. But better. <br />Animal Bar- 8.5/10- Great vocals and songwriting complimented by Frusciante's usual genius. <br />So Much I- 9/10/- Cool song, everything is good. God they are a good band. Although not sure about sequencing; a little similar to previous song. <br />Storm in a Teacup- 8.5/10- Similar tempo to a song like readymade but so much more polished. Guitar is superb towards the end. <br />We Believe- 8/10- Lots of ppl hate this one, but apart from the annoying 'we believe, we believe' in the chorus i found it great. <br />Turn it Again- 8.5/10- Wow. A good song it followed by guitar work that deserves a nobel prize. This six minute track includes two minutes of Frusiciante lovin his gutiar sick. <br />Death of a Martian- 8.5/10- Still trying new styles by the 28th track. Great finish to a masterpiece. As is often the case with the chilis, the first verse is the best.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I haven't seen the original version, so I won't compare it with that movie. This is a really nice movie, one of the best family movies I've seen. Funny all the way and a bit sentimenatal at times. I was actually gonna cry at a point!! Linday Lohan does a great job as Annie and Hallie, Dennis Quaid turns in a great performance as always. The rest of the cast is good too. <br /> <br />Give this movie a shot, you'll like it!!
B00005JP4U|3.0|Are movies or documentaries designed to inform or entertain? That's pretty much been a basic question most people have asked. I bring it up again because in cinematic terms Davis Guggenheim's \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" lacks but the message Al Gore brings to the table is essential.<br /><br /> For those who don't know \\"An Inconveinet Truth\\" is a documentary which follows former vice-president Al Gore, who has been giving lectures literally across the world on the subject of global warming.<br /><br /> Guggenheim takes Gore's lecture material and cross-cuts it with other footage of Gore and stats and pie charts. Perhaps I'm not doing a great job visually describing the movie to you. Or maybe it just doesn't sound all at that interesting. That, ultimately, isn't the point. Don't walk into \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" and expect to be thoroughly entertained. That's not to say the documentary is boring. I never onced check my watch. I listened attentively to what Gore was saying. But Gore's main intention with this documentary is simply to inform and make people act after seeing this.<br /><br /> I consider myself somewhat political. I've been interested in politics for about the last 4, 5 years. But I never knew until recently that the weather is a political issue. I knew Democrats and Republicans debate everything under the sun; tax cuts, health care, minium wage (although I don't know why!). But the weather? Who knew there was a Democrat response and a Republican response. I always thought it was a scientific fact global warming exist. I didn't know as some Republicans say \\"the jury is still out\\". But, what do I know I'm just a stupid 23 year old college student.<br /><br /> \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" will be turned into a political documentary. But it shouldn't be. Gore isn't really blaming anyone for this problem. Yes, I admit, there are a few jabs taken at the Bush administration, but it's mostly done for laughs. Gore says it is up to all of us to help solve the problem. But, knowing what I know now, about the weather being a political issue, I understand this will be turned into a political documentary. And I also understand that a large amount of Republicans will not see this movie. Even though I'm young, I've learned something very important about people. Ideology will always trump facts. Have hurricanes been getting stronger? Have 10 of the 14 hottest summers been in recent years? Have glaciers started to melt? Have there been stories of polar bears drowning? The answer to all these question is yes. But, ideology trumps facts. If you simply don't want to believe in global warming all the facts in the world can be presented to you and it's not going to change your mind. This is sad because in the end the only people who are going to see this documentary are people who already believe in global warming. Gore's message will not reach anyone new.<br /><br /> In the end \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is not a rabble rousing documentary the way \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" was. It lacks a certain excitement I admit. But people should see this because the message is so important. This issue will affect everyone. It doesn't matter how you vote. It everyone's problem. So inform yourself and go see it! *** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br />Bottom-line: Admittedly not as exciting as \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" but this isn't a political documentary and it's message is more important, because it goes across party lines. Lacks a certain excitement but truly needs to be seen by everyone.ut the weather being a political issue, I understand this will be turned into a political documentary.

B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk is quite simply the best war movie I have seen. It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.<br /><br />For whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After \\"stirring up the hornet's nest\\", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, \\"Leave No Man Behind\\".<br /><br />Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence.<br /><br />Black Hawk Down is without peer. It tells the story of 24 hours in the life of US soldiers in a clear, focused, and honorable manner. What other true-events film has come close? Apollo 13 dramatized and created people and events for a terrific film. Glory and Schindler's List did the same, successfully and honorably taking liberties with actual occurences for the sake of movie-dom. PS: check out Mike Durant's new book \\"In The Company of Heroes\\".rs, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|I remember in 1968 saving up my allowance so I could buy \\"Johnny Cash at San Quientin.\\"  I have been a fan that long.  I had read the autobiography and other things so I knew the story.  The movie did change some things, like what song he first recorded, but the essence and flavor is there.  The performances by Pheonix and Witherspoon are really class acts.  I thought their singing was great, especially considering that I knew what the songs were supposed to sound like.  The movie is harsh but that was his life.  Watch this movie.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I'm tempted to go ahead and purchase this full season one, but the fact that the last episodes are still airing in US forces me to engage my usually lacking self-discipline--often absent in such matters (queen of spoiler boards that I am known to be!)<br /><br />The offbeat humor and twisty plots make this show a ton of fun to follow.  Even my children love it, making it something we can all enjoy together.  Although parts of it are certainly the stuff of potential nightmares, I've been amazed how our kids just laugh the darker stuff off.<br /><br />For a tongue-in-cheek take on time travel (in a police box, no less!) this would be your show.
076790592X|4.0|My grandfather said, \\"We come into the world with fists clenched, as if holding tightly - we leave the world with palms open, willingly or unwillingly having let go of everything\\".<br /><br />Wisdom and grace in living is in willingly letting go, or in the words of Morrie Schwartz, about whom this book is written, \\"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\\".<br /><br />Morrie has been diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), and knows that he will progressively lose all physical capability, and then will lose his life. Yet he is serene, he views his remaining time as a gift, and he makes use of it to confer a blessing on those around him.<br /><br />One of the many who is blessed is Mitch Albom, the author, a former student of Morrie's (he had been a renowned sociology professor at Brandeis). This is the story of their dialogue over the course of fourteen Tuesday visits to the home of the dying sage.<br /><br />Albom, who is on a fast career track, comes to reevaluate the significance of his priorities as a result of these interactions. He describes the sessions with his mentor lovingly, and with a deep sensitivity that goes straight to the heart.<br /><br />He also describes the news of the outside world that is unfolding as he sits at the feet of his suffering teacher. Juxtaposed against the heroic posture of the dying man, current events are shown to be positively surreal. For instance, \\"In rural Kentucky, three men threw pieces of a tombstone off a bridge, smashing the windshield of a passing car, killing a teenage girl who was traveling with her family on a religious pilgrimage. In California, the O. J. Simpson trial was heading to a conclusion, and the whole country seemed to be obsessed\\".<br /><br />And Morrie speaks, \\"Love is when you are as concerned about someone else's situation as you are about your own\\".<br /><br />Tears come easily during the reading of this very good book.<br /><br />All this having been said, why a recommendation of fours stars rather than five? Albom's writing style seems at times overly slick and a bit commercial. This is the one aspect of which Morrie would not have approved.rly slick and a bit commercial.

B000002UJQ|5.0|this album is what defines radiohead. the sound, the minimalism, the epic sounds made soflty. ah but i cannot acuratly describe radioheads music to a stranger. different people see different things in it. i have a friend whos favorite album is pablo honey, and another whos favorite is the bends. everyone sees something different in radiohead, but all the people who have the patience to listen to them love them. in an age wehre singles rule the world and everryone goes only and buys individal songs instead of the whole album. this is destroying ok computer, because it is meant to be listened to as an album. that is why this is such a great work. it is meant to be listened to as an album. but on to how it sounds.  In the begining, oyur brought in with the ultimate opening song, whcih surpasses even my former fav opening song, tired of sex form weezers only truly great work, pinkerton. airbag sweeps you into this mildy desperate paranoid world, where people are fully aware of its hopelessness but blokc it out. paranoind android i ahve not given enough listenes to to fuly understand it, but i will come to that point. the next few songs cover various characters in this album, when we finally come to fitter happier. this song is the ultimate confession of an average citezen of ok computer, telling everyone how he still does everything the same as we do, but it lacks passion and hope, theres nothing greater to be gained from these actions than depravity. as the album moves tward its end, the world begins to fall apart, with megalomaniacs pushing for power and egotists realizin they need help. the final song holds a seperate meaning for everyone. to me, it was a visitor, who gets into a cab, but the driver is going too fast. they crash, but an airbag saves the drivers life.... and anyone who has been patient enough to listen to the album, i mean really listen. will get exactly how that works.
B00006RAKP|5.0|to put it in simple terms Elton John is a musical genius and this  2 disc set proves it beyond a doubt.there's hardly a song here thats not a hit there all great!!! go buy this set you wont be disappointed highly recommended!!!
B00006JIA4|5.0|This review might seem a little over the top, simply because Queen is my favorite band. Ever. Well, these were the first CDs I ever bought, mostly because I liked the songs \\"We Will Rock You/ We Are The Champions\\" and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was cool. Also, I got this one instead of the 2 disk set, not because the third disk was anything worth even listening to, but it was on sale for a couple bucks cheaper than the other one.  <br />   First of all, from the first time I heard it, I thought that Disk 1 was phenominal. Now that I'm collecting the records, I realize that it is missing some hits, such as, one of my favorites, \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\", but as far as just the music goes, it's almost perfect. <br />   I wasn't really interested in Disc 2 when I first got it. The only song I loved was \\"Under Pressure\\". However, listing back to it, I have come to like it a lot more now. The song \\"I Want It All\\" has a sweet riff in the intro. I only wish Brian May had more guitar parts like that one. <br />   And now Disk 3... this one is extremly awkward. It mostly consists of live tracks and remixes, all of which are not very good. The rest of them are ballads, with the exception of \\"Princes Of The Universe\\", which is a stupid song except for May's solo. <br />   Over all, this is a great collection. Still, I would endorse buying the 2 disk set instead, unless you get lucky like I did with the sale.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This CD is so  fine...It has that spacey, reflective mambo going on throughout, very sexy, island drift-away sounds... which might take you away  to where you want to be. As  Gilmour splashes his wonderful guitar in-n-out on all of these conceptive, intertwining, weaving sounds... Interesting, mesmerizing, laid-back thought provoking(mostly)instrumental loveliness ...It's a different plane your riding...Floating & stoney but a sure ride...I can see that Blue Water and introspective island, were all on & mostly ignore...I adore Floyd just as I love where Gilmour is going here in his life...Surrounded by emptiness we all feel from time to time and want to just get away...Still, were just on an island...The music flows from track to track and not any real surprises(but to me that's the restrained beauty of this CD)... warm sunny feelings, days of contemplation...to get us just right...I'm always be ready for the tripy, soaring Gilmour with Floyd... However, this is just as incredibly moving and kick-ass on it's own way...A great musician throwing out some perfect music to create & set the mood...MTV will never have a place for this...But, there's always a place for this music in my life...Chris Rea might be along for the ride here...Gilmour shows what a true cosmic master is capable of...When your done smilin and tripping... perhaps if one cares to, put on something else that breaks this insightful mood...This is an eloquent CD!
B00004THAY|5.0|For some reason, I waited a few years to get this. Do NOT ask me why. This is a stellar album from two absolute masters. Both are absolutely playing their butts off here with gorgeous tone,especially B.B. and Lucille( does blues guitar tone get any better than that?). And both men have never sounded finer vocally(Clapton especially. Everybody knows what he can do with a Strat, but he is absolutely underrated as a vocalist).There's not a bad track on here, but real standouts are the absolutely KILLER title track, B.B.'s classics 3 O'Clock Blues, Days of Old and Help the Poor, and the beyond-cool cover of the Sam and Dave classic, Hold On I'm Coming. B.B. and Slowhand had wanted for years to do an album together, but for decades were unable to. This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the best things in life are worth waiting for. B.B. has never to my knowledge failed to turn in a great performance on anything, but this is the best Eric has sounded in years. Clapton has a tendency to drift into adult contemporary waters, and sometimes sounds like he's phoning it in in recent years, but put him on stage or in the studio with someone he respects and admires, and he never fails to show that he's still got the passion and the fire. Stuff like this is why myself  and many other guitar players picked up the axe in the first place. If you're a blues guitar fanatic, you NEED this. Better yet, buy a copy of this and give it to the 14 year old budding guitar player in your life. They might not appreciate it now, but in time, they will.
B00000G3I2|4.0|i managed to miss this: one of those generational impact movies, and never caught up to it until now. it is difficult to remember that all the cliches were NOT cliches when this movie was released, but i was able to watch it and just enjoy the crisp acting by all 8 stars. and of course there IS that soundtrack. still, the movie ripped off \\"the return of the secaucus 7\\", and tho i havent seen that in a long time, my guess is id prefer it on a more core level.
B00005JP4U|5.0|First of all, global warming is a true fact. Anyone who doesn't believe in this needs to come out of their house more often, or stop driving gargantous SUVs. Second of all this film is NOT a propaganda benefiting the democratic wing of the United States. This was a BOOK written by Al Gore. True he does crack some jokes based on his brief presidency, and the Bush administration. But the whole film is about his arguements and his stand point of the fact that in 10 years or so we will be experiencing ultimatal changes  in this world. I.E. polar ice caps melting, cities flooding, hurricanes possibly three times as powerful as katrina hitting cities like New York, Cali, Nepal.... The mainframe of this film is to explain the causes of using carbon based fuel. True that huge SUV that cost you like a 100,000 dollars is killing the ozone layer due to a little chemical called CO2  (Carbon Dyoxide) decomposing the bonded chemicals that make up the ozone layer. See im not going to go on this whole scientific explanation of this whole ordeal 'cause I know no one is going to listen. So instead I will put it like this, pollution is bad, someone wrote a book and made a film based of the side effects of the pollution we've made, little to no people are going to see this film because they don't believe its true we're heating up the planet (which is painfully dumb), or plainly criticize it due to their political views.  In the end this is America, we're allowed to  think and act as we please. So by ending this rant I say watch this movie, think about it, and before you come up with anything to say ask yourself \\"what can I do to stop all of this?\\"
B00000DHRZ|4.0|The Offspring changed their style a bit. Songs such as \\"Pretty Fly For a White Guy,\\" and \\"Why Don't You Get A Job?\\" is the new Offspring, while, \\"Staring at the Sun,\\" (my personal favorite) \\"She's Got Issues,\\" and \\"The Kids Aren't Alright.\\" is the old Offspring. If you like the last couple, I suggest Ixnay on the Hombre and Splinter before another Offspring album. Staring At The Sun is a great song, in my opinion, one of the best by Offspring.
B0009JAENU|5.0|Just got it today and have only listened to it twice, but I think this one is going to get listened to a lot. <br /> <br />I was wondering why it seemed so enchanting to me. I have heard each of them 3 or 4 times when they were at Curtis together and once in a mini concert together back then. It finally struck me that in addition to fine musicianship, an interpretation that suits my prejudices and all the other fine things the other reviewers said... they play so wonderfully together. I had never realized how much that could add, but doing the dance of the music together the way they do on this recording adds a magical quality. <br /> <br />I hope Natalie Zhu records some solo things. If she does, I'm a buyer.
B000003TAR|5.0|This album blew me away when I first put it into my 89 Olds tape player back in 1994...<br /><br />Serve The Servants kicks it off with a hard shot to the balls:<br /><br />\\"Teenage agnst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old..\\"<br /><br />I still crank that song when I'm pissed:)<br /><br />And Senseless Apprentice shows just how damn good they sound when a producer lets them make some noise. How good is Dave Grohl? He was the DRUMMER folks, and he went on to make today's hugely popular band \\"Foo Fighters\\".<br /><br />There isnt a bad track on here. The CD is just a laundry list of clues leading up to the enevitable death of a rock icon. This was a lasting legacy to a GREAT band, take it for what it was.. excellent power infused poetry..
B00005ATQD|5.0|hellooo? did critics see the same movie i saw? this movie joins stanley kubricks great science fiction trilogy of 1964-71 (\\"dr strangelove\\", \\"2001\\", \\"clockwork orange\\") in my list of the 100 best films ever. tom cruise reminds us that if you skip the baggage hes a fine actor (always has been, always will be) and nicole kidman was ridiculously not even nominated for an oscar (repeating the injustice of \\"to die for\\", and pointing out even more the absurdity of her eventual victory in the bloated \\"the hours\\"). there is sooooo much going on in this movie. this is imho the finest comedy of manners (does anybody even know what that phrase means nowadays?) about american life since \\"the graduate\\". i remember being 14 years old and sitting in a theater watching \\"2001\\" with my bewildered parents and looking over and realizing the gap was there (love you still, mom & dad); you either get this film or you dont, but i defy anyone to not remember it. thank you stanley kubrick, for the rich movie experiences you gave us, and especially for this final masterpiece to which i will gladly return.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album portrays the many different styles of music the Chili Peppers are capable of making.  It mixes the sounds of their more popular songs with those that are equal in quality but never catch on in the main stream.  Over all, this is an amazing CD and is worth the list price.
B000002N2P|5.0|Green Day has always been known as a pop-punk band. Which is impossible. You don't mix pop and punk. It's one or the other. But this album shows pure punk.   Armatage Shanks- it has a basic beat, with raw enegry. Good lyrics. 7/10    Brat- Funny lyrics, but i don't suggest your parents hearing it. \\"I'll just wait for mom and dad to die, get my inheritance.\\" 8/10    Stuck With Me- One of the larger hits from the album. Great guitar, and awesome. \\"Well, I know I'm not alright.\\" - 9/10    Geek Stink Breath- Good song about drugs. Awesome bass line. The music video is pretty gross, though. \\"I'm on roll, no self-control.\\" 10/10     No Pride- an ironic song about losing respect for yourself. One of my favorites. \\"You'd better swallow your pride or you're gonna choke on it.\\" - 9/10    Bab's Uvula Who?- simple bass line, simple in everything, but still good. \\"I've got a knack for [...] everything up.\\" 7/10    86- A very basic song, very repitive to the point of annoyance. A slower song than the rest. \\"So stand aside and let the next one pass.\\" The chorus, \\"There's no return from 86,\\" can get annoying, though. 6/10    Panic Song- An instrumental for the first roughly 2 minutes, then BJ starts singing. Clever, and the intrumental doesn't bore you. It sounds panicked and leads well into the lyrics. \\"Well, the world is a sick machine, breeding a mass of [...].\\" 10/10     Stuart and the Ave. - I have heard every Green Day album there is, including the awful AI, but this song remains my favorite. Clever, awesome work with the bass and guitar, and simply a great song. \\"Seasons change as well as minds, and I'm a two-faced clown.\\" It really should have been International Superhits! They curse alot, but who cares? If you don't want cursing, you shouldn't be listening to Green Day. - 20/10    Brain Stew- way overrated. It's really not that good. Pretty boring, actually. But if you want to learn how to play bass, this is a good song to use. The bass line's pitifully easy. -6/10    Jaded- The fastest song on the album. Amazing work. Really great. \\"Hooray we're gonna die!\\" A sarcastic song. - 9/10    Westbound Sign- Probbaly, beside Brain Stew, the softest song on the album.Pretty good, doesn't bore you, intresting lyrics about Adrienne coming to California to live with Billie-Joe. \\"Weighed out her choices on a scale, prevailing nothing makes sense.\\" 8/10 [...]    Tight Wad Hill- A pretty sweet song. Not awesome, and really fast, but that's good. \\"Making the rounds once again.\\" It's a pretty good song. 9/10    Walking Contradiction- AWESOME! Clever lyrics, awesome bass line. \\"Talk is cheap, but lies are expensive.\\" The msuic video's great too. This song really deserved to get on International Superhits! - 10/10     Insomniac is a great album. But for all you losers who haven't heard anything but American Idiot and want this album to be like it, fat chance! This is a real punk album, not pop-punk. So, if you listen to pop, don't get this. If you're a real punk, get it. You'll love it, trust me.
0920668372|1.0|I don't know exactly what the problem is with this book- ordinarily when a book is a parable I can appreciate it for its message. And I realize lots of people seem to like it because unfortunately I received 4 copies as gifts (leaving me to wonder ungraciously if my loved ones actually read beyond the title before purchasing?!) It starts out great and funny and each page turn it gets a little worse until by the end I'm wondering why I feel not sentimental and touched but weirded out and miserable.  I think it is the overwhelming sadness caused by pondering the fact that my son and I will ultimately be separated, and particularly the grief that this will cause him.  But when you are bouncing your beautiful preschooler on your lap, who needs to dwell on death and separation?!  I say read \\"I Love you Stinky Face\\" by Lisa Mccourt to your kiddo instead, and enjoy celebrating a mother's undconditional love in a completely fun, well illustrated way that doesn't leave you wondering about the state of your mental health and doesn't cause your child to ask a lot of disturbing questions at much too young an age.  BTW, I love the suggestion to omit the text and use the pictures to point out the funny no no's in the book.  Maybe I will unearth it from the bottom of the book pile for that purpose!
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 just are'nt what they used to be, and that my friends is bad! <br />Just don't give me that, oh \\"you can't accept that this band has moved on, bla bla bla bla\\", yeah, moved on to corporate junk. <br /> <br />The music does not speak for itself at all on this album, I found \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" alright, nothing as insulting to U2s fans as this joke. This is the so called back to basics U2? Well U2 were never about the basics? What is the basics anyway the way critics and some people percieve your music, mainly cause they are told what to think (ie Pop). <br /> <br />Pop would of been U2s best album yet, if they had finished it, which they did'nt as they booked the tour to soon. <br />Heres hoping they go back (which they are planning to) and finish it. Anyway the video clip versions sound better than good if you've seen them. <br /> <br />Everyone called U2s Pop album techno? Which is beyond alot of true U2 fans, its not the U2 people were probably used to, but when I saw the video versions of \\"Discotheque\\" \\"Last Night On Earth\\" \\"Please\\" \\"Mofo\\" and \\"If God will send his angels\\" on thje eve of the release of this album, with the every U2 video ever made television \\"show\\", I was blown away, it was the best stufff I had ever heard by them. Anyway, U2 panicked after Popmart, because they thought they were losing their fan base who they thought wanted their 80s sound again. <br /> <br />So in 2000 they went to a more Pop sound on \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" mostly good songs, lacking somewhat, no sellout. <br /> <br />Apart from their crtappy Elevation licve from Boston 2001, in which one fan complained they came out and picked young fresher faced people for the front row, as they were filming it for the DVD, the show of course was appalling. (Watch the DVD) <br /> <br />Actually thinking about U2 these days is making me feel physically sick, so I am going toi stop typing now and hope they redeem themselves from all this crap, and released a proper album. (Heres hope hanging by a bit of dental floss)
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I'm a huge fan of RHCP. They've had a great career and they just keep the albums coming, each one fun and awesome. This isn't as good as some of their other albums, but it's on par with By The Way. It's a very easy listen. I find myself listening to it every time I'm just relaxing or driving in the car. <br /> <br />There are a few things I find strange on the discs though. I feel as if the songs weren't spread out very well. I feel as if the first half of each cd is better than the second.  Although all the songs are fun to listen to, some aren't as good as others. <br /> <br />RHCP have given us another great ablum. This time a wonderful 2-disc set. Give it a listen, you'll enjoy it.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Steve Vai says that Satriani is the one guitarist who can make his hair stand on end. This is the best example of why he says this. Just listen to the title track \\"Surfing with the Alien\\": rock-solid grove, uncanny tapping passages, middle estern modal ideas, it just does NOT quit. Looking back on this recording I can only lament that the musical concept that Satch is working with (his band, his sound, the compositions) just never got much better than this. Perhpas that is noramal, \\"first (nearly so) album syndrome\\". There are not many people who can play rock (shred) guitar better than this.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Some of my best friends are gay, so your comment becomes especially sensitive to me. <br /> <br />Reviewer Kyle Bob \\"tyrone,\\" welcome to America, where people of all beliefs and ideals can come together. Unfortunately, you overstayed your welcome. Brokeback Mountain is the American cry for freedom, and a big step towards change and acceptance, but if you can't see that, you are hopeless.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This legendary album remains, nearly 40 years later, one of the most harrowing and unforgettable recordings in country music or any other genre for that matter.  There is little to be added to the wildly told story behind this album and its recording in front of prisoners and for anyone who hers this for the first of the one-millionth time who doesn't get chills you'd best be taking your pulse.
0679735259|1.0|But if you have seen full metal jacket, if you have seen apocalypse now, if you have seen any vietnam movie (year of the pig, hearts and minds...) there is no reason to buy this book. It's done in the kerouac style of the 60s, which impresses no one these days. It's a smallminded personal narrative (fiction).
0553565915|5.0|I had an NDE (near death experience, in my case, being near someone else's death!) in 1980 which resulted in an experience of the \\"Light\\" that was so instructive and revelatory that I read Ms. Eadie's book with great anticipation.  It, along with Betty Malz's \\"My Glimpse of Eternity\\" and Dannion Brinkley's \\"Saved by the Light\\" describe the Light I saw and know.<br /><br />My heart leapt when I read these (and other) passages from \\"Embraced by the Light\\":<br /><br />\\"I saw a pinpoint of light...I was instinctively attracted to it...  As I approached it, I noticed the figure of a man standing in it, with the light radiating all around him...the light became brilliant...I knew that no earthly eyes in their natural state could look upon this light without being destroyed.  Only spiritual eyes could endure it--and appreciate it...<br /><br />\\"I saw that the light immediately around him was golden, as if his whole body had a golden halo around it, and I could see that the golden halo burst out from around him and spread into a brilliant, magnificent whiteness that extended for some distance.  I felt his light blending into mine, literally, and I felt my light being drawn to his.  It was as if there were two lamps in a room, both shining, their light merging together.  It's hard to tell where one light ends and the other begins; they just become one light....And as our lights merged, I felt as if I had stepped into his countenance, and I felt an utter explosion of love...<br /><br />\\"Then questions began coming to my mind...His light now began to fill my mind, and my questions were answered even before I fully asked them.  His light was knowledge.  It had power to fill me with all truth.  As I gained confidence and let the light flow into me, my questions came faster than I thought possible, and they were just as quickly answered...<br /><br />\\"As more questions bubbled out of me, I became aware of his sense of humor.  Almost laughing, he suggested that I slow down, that I could know all I desired.  But I wanted to know EVERYTHING, from beginning to end.  My curiosity had always been a torment to my parents and husband -- and sometimes to me -- but now it was a blessing, and I was thrilled with the freedom of learning.  I was being taught by the master teacher!  My comprehension was such that I could understand volumes in an instant...Knowledge permeated me.  In a sense it BECAME me, and I was amazed at my ability to comprehend the mysteries of the universe simply by reflecting on them.\\"<br /><br />Compare my experience, though hers was much, much greater:<br /><br />April of 1980: Mrs. Schumeister and the Light Dream<br /><br />My \\"Light Dream\\" occurred in April of 1980 in St. Paul, MN. I was 25 years old and was engaged to my husband Jim.<br /><br />Preamble to dream/vision: In the Spring of 1980 (this is \\"real life\\", not the dream/vision yet), I was working as a station secretary at United & Children's Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota, helping Jim through school. At the hospital, being in charge of the rolladex, one thing I did know about each patient was their religion.<br /><br />In April of 1980, a Jewish woman, 84-year-old Mrs. Ruth Schumeister, died, separated from me by only a wall. Her room was the first in the row of rooms and was therefore closest to me at my desk. Three nights later I had this dream:<br /><br />THE LIGHT DREAM<br /><br />Mrs. Schumeister has died. Jim and I are at the funeral home, in front of Mrs. Schumeister's daughter. I am filled, consumed by, a fervent desire that she accept us, even though we aren't Jewish. With every fiber of my being I yearn for this acceptance, and fear that it may be withheld. Mrs. Schumeister's daughter asks us, \\"Would you like to review the body?\\" Before I can answer, Jim, standing just behind me, grabs my left elbow and hisses, \\"You know how much I am affected by Death!\\" I think, \\"No I don't...And that hurts!\\"<br /><br />Then I hear a voice say, not in \\"out-loud\\" words, but in precisely these words, \\"Something about the nature of Death will be revealed to you.\\"<br /><br />In the next scene, Jim and I are alone in a waiting room, on the opposite sides of an oval table, kitty corner. I'm to the right, and Jim is across the table to my left. We are waiting to review the body. An empty ritual, a boring, meaningless act. Familiar, useless, custom. People do it, so now we will do it. I am very, very bored, but not unhappy. In retrospect I see that it was the familiar, deep boredom to which we, unbeknownst to ourselves, are quite accustomed. I was so bored that (amazingly enough) I had forgotten anything that was out-of-the-ordinary in the scene before: Jim's grip on my arm, his words, the Voice.<br /><br />Looking about, I cast my eyes about the room. Hither and thither.  Unexpectedly my eyes meet Jim's -- Mr. \\"You Know How Much I Am Affected By Death\\" Jim. The instant our eyes meet, to my amazement (I only knew how bored I'd been by how unbored I was then!) a joyous golden light poured out of his eyes, swept past me to the right, glittering with glitters and sparkles, swirling, dancing joyously...It wasn't as if it were one thing, but as if it were many things, friends, happy together and celebrating! Above all, celebrating! Its very \\"Being\\" was communicatory: in pure fun, anticipation and joy it radiated - I saw it was - Jim's \\"Foreknowledge of the Splendor After Death.\\" Those were the exact words of what it was, which it communicated by simply joyously being it. I know this is hard to believe.<br /><br />Following its trajectory, I turned to the right.  Before me I saw an arched doorway. Mrs. Schumeister's body lay just beyond (reclined, head higher than the feet, not supported by anything, and although I'm not sure about this part, it was as if wrapped in a kind of cocoon - I saw that death, to my surprise, was not \\"gone forever\\", but instead, a deepest of sleep). Above her body, a Light was working on her, working and pulling, working to change her into what it was.<br /><br />I couldn't see this Light clearly enough! I struggled to see it more clearly (peering as if around a bunch of heads in my way) but it was no use. I couldn't see it clearly enough. I re... what's the word? When you make due with something because you have no choice, so you console yourself with the status quo?<br /><br />Then, when I'd resolved to accept that's all I could see, suddenly the Light was in front of me, to my right, 6 or 10 feet away! It was about 6 or 8 feet tall, white and oval shaped (the smaller part of the oval shape was on the ground with the wider part above). I was instantly filled with joy, the most I'd ever felt! thinking: \\"Now, I'm finally going to be able to know everything I've always wanted to know!\\"<br /><br />My curiosity pierced into the Light and all I saw was Light. It was a golden, teaching light, that poured past me, through me (especially through my eyes), and as it did so, it taught without words. It was like reading the best book, having the best conversation, learning every second more of what one wants to know.<br /><br />Suddenly the Light did an unexpected fuzzy dissolve. During this dissolve, its power of teaching halted, as if held in abeyance. I watched, uncomprehending. After a couple of seconds, the fuzziness broke, and a GREATER power of this same Light resumed its \\"pouring past and through and into\\", it's teaching. I thought, \\"Wow! What was before was enough, and there's even more!?! This is incredible!\\" Then I became caught up again in its teaching... (I can't put it into words because it taught without words).<br /><br />Another dissolve happened and took me by surprise. I was so absorbed, I'd forgotten it had this tendency. An augmentation in the Light again!  And again I became engrossed...<br /><br />When the NEXT dissolve merely began to begin, I sensed the Power behind it and instantly knew I couldn't handle it. Its incipience contained the very beginning of the HINTS of what it contained, a world, a gift, so glorious, so revelatory I knew I could not take it in in my present form. I felt it was going to blow me into a million bits. I didn't know who or where I'd be, if I could come back, if I'd be alone... I was utterly afraid.<br /><br />I turned my head quickly to look away, to stay in this world -- to forestall this shattering. To my shock, I saw that the power of the Light had my eyes in its hold. My head could not turn away! I knew I had only a second to steel myself.  Eyes glued to the dissolve and growing Light, in greatest fear, I made my body stiff...<br /><br />At that moment, a Wind came out of the Light and blew my head to the side!<br /><br />Whew! I have never been so relieved. The Light was still to my right and communicated (I felt its humor): \\"I'm still here. Nothing prevents you from turning your head and looking again. Then you can `finally get to know everything you always wanted to know!' \\" (Being created in God's image, did I see where our gift of sarcasm comes from?)<br /><br />I thought, \\"No, thank you!\\"  Grateful for what I had seen, and what I had not seen!<br /><br />END OF LIGHT DREAM<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />By the Light's hold on my eyes, and by the wind's subsequent rescue of me, the Light taught me that I had taken it for a mere 'vehicle' - alive, yes, but alive for my personal use and enlightenment - whereas it IS (to put it mildly) alive in its own right.  How do we get to it again?  Prayer?  Yuck!  After considering it a second, we wave it away, for fear of prayer's horrible boredom.  Then I remember the dichotomy (above) between my utter boredom and its opposite!  In this regard, I love Betty Eadie's vision of prayers themselves, as they appear coming into Heaven!  And how they are attended to.<br /><br />Betty Eadie, Betty Malz, and Dannion Brinkley's experiences involved a life review, and what they learned makes their books worth owning and cherishing.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|This is the recording Pat Metheny has been building towards his whole career. NOW I understand what Pat was aiming at all these years. He's been trying to pull off a true fusion of world music, folk, bebop, and minimalism. That requires incredible chops, composing ability, and taste. Pat's chops have been good enough to play virtually anything he wanted at least since 1989's Question and Answer. He's been writing strong tunes at least since his 1991 collaboration with John Scofield, I Can See Your House From Here. But the compositions on past Pat Metheny Group recordings have uniformly been marred by an excess of sentimentalism and a lack of taste, especially in the vocal arrangements. The ability to write a compelling suite of compositions was really the last barrier Pat faced. And boy has he overcome it! The Way Up is really 69 minutes of through-composed music with room built in for soloing. It is both intellectually rigorous and incredibly moving. Up until now, I've begrudged Pat's incredible financial success with his main group because there have been so many other bands that have left him in the dust artistically but haven't been supported by the public. But it's time to eat crow. The Way Up is nothing less than transcendent. If you would like to read more reviews like this, check out JazzboNotes.com.
B000056VJ7|1.0|It is sad, and more than a little scary, to see how many reviews use the word \\"classic\\" to describe this roadkill of an album. To do so further reduces the word to utterly uselessness. <br /> <br />\\"Bat Out of Hell\\" remains what is was in 1978 -- a horrifically bad set of songs made all the worse by the bombastic and pompous production. That people still listen to this today just goes to show that no one has even gone broke underestimating the taste of the American public. If you have not had a copy of this for the past 28 years you need to think long and hard: If you have gone so long without it, why buy it now? <br /> <br />Overwrought and completely and utterly unlistenable, it is claptrap like this that remind us just what it was that punk was (thankfully) rebelling against in the first place. <br /> <br />Avoid.  For all that is good and holy in this world, AVOID!

B000E97Y6A|5.0|When I saw the first King Kong movie I felt like I wanted to throw it away. But then I saw this movie and the special effects of Peter Jackson and not only Jack Black plays as Carl Denham I'd have to say bravo! My favorite part is the T-Rex battle. Especially when kong snapped its jaw. Well done Peter!
B000E97HIA|5.0|I can't even fix my lips to say I've been a Prince fan. I was never too sure what he was about. Yeah, I was there for \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\" in the late '70s. I took mental notes as he dropped hits tit-for-tat against big-dog MJ throughout the '80s. I even caught the rocky '90s, where Prince battled his label and fought for continued relevance simultaneously. I admittedly own a couple of old Prince albums, but I was just trying to get girls, man. I've heard Prince enough to know what he's capable of, but it's just now, with the release of 3121, that I'm starting to listen.  <br /> <br />With the warbled intro-title track, I thought, \\"Uh oh, what would this say if it was played backwards?\\", but what followed was nothing but high-quality Prince. The Purple One pulls no punches with the freak-funk \\"Black Sweat\\", which features Prince's classic falsetto that should all but put Pharrell out of business and flashes a sound that the strip clubs will fiend for, yet actually conveys a message of dance and discipline. \\"Lolita\\" is a definite jump-back to his '80s style with dance-worthy synth chords and playful call-and-response reminiscent of himself and The Time. \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\" featuring Tamar has a sound you would swear was neo-soul, but is straight gospel in terms of its message. Only for the Saved & Sexy!!! \\"Get On The Boat\\" is a metaphor of positivity wrapped into a '70s style funk session. Envision the cut \\"Musicology\\" with a big band behind it, you're in the ballpark. It's almost like Prince knew I was an EWF fan! I play this one back often and it's the longest cut here! <br /> <br />Prince's conversion to Jehovah's Witness is no secret, but just in case anyone out there is wondering, \\"What about his infamous sex songs?\\" well...just don't call them that anymore. But there are plenty of intimate (yet somehow clean) joints in this package, such as the fluid & steamy \\"Incense and Candles\\" (\\"I know you want to take off all your clothes/But please don't doit\\"), the emotionally combative \\"The Dance\\", the bluesy \\"Satisfied\\" and the salsa-inducing \\"Te Amo Corazon\\". Those that are not standing over every word will not realize the strategically air-brushed lyrics. <br /> <br />This album is simply a thoroughly diverse work of art that eerily manages to sing a moral and even Christian message without sacrificing the magical mystique Prince has forged over the years. A feat that thousands of artists have attempted and failed. Don't get me wrong, this is not a gospel album, but it's a refreshingly positive change to the Prince of old, at least lyrically. And to be this sharp pushing 50 is just short of unheard of. He hasn't lost a thing, folks. He's just managed to get the \\"new him\\" 100% right this time around, and I wouldn't be surprised if 3121 leads others to the path of righteousness. Finally, an album with a purpose!
B00009W0U4|3.0|This movie is among the 1000 Best Movies in DVD by Peter Travers, that is why I bought it. During 10 minutes, you see the beautiful Belucci being raped on a tunnel in Paris, and that scene is disturbing. The whole movie is, with an interesting plot told backwards, from the end to the beginning on a full day of the life of these characters. At the beginning of the movie (which would be the end of the story), we are at the club \\"Rectum\\" (ass in Latin ...), a gay night club where people meet to have sex. There, Marcus is looking for Tenia, the responsible for raping and beating Alex, his girlfriend. Another extremely disturbing scene takes place in that club (but I am not to say, since I don't want to spoil the movie), and so on ... Saying this is not a good movie would not be fair, but it is definetely a movie not to please the majority of the public, with a kind of \\"dizzy\\" camera style, moving here and there, in circles, crazy, to tell a crazy-disturbing story. It's a French movie, so don't expect anything related to American standards, because European films are different from American. The movie won best film at the Stockholm Film Festival (2002), and was in the official selection of the Sundance Film Festival (2003) and Cannes (2002) among others. The DVD comes with an interesting documentary about the special effects, and two lame \\"deleted scenes\\" that look more like video clips than deleted scenes. Also a commercial about the soundtrack and several trailers of the movie. The movie is in French with Spanish and English subtitles.<br /><br />After all, an interesting movie which will please those who like to see the beautiful Bellucci, gay and lesbian movies, violence, disturbing scenes, weird stories, and transgression on art.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|I must say this DVD is great, the outfit she wears in the first songs is amazing, she looks great during the whole concert, though. She's a great performer, although she's not as good as Madonna. I hate comparing them, but both of them are good at what they do. I feel sorry for Madonna because she hasn't released many DVDs lately, I would like to see her Re-Invention Tour: Live in Lisbon on DVD, but I guess I'll have to wait, how long? She needs more DVDs, We don't even have either her Virgin Tour or her Blond Ambition Tour on DVD. Why??? I have no idea. <br /> <br />Anyway, Kylie is a good performer, her voice is pretty good and her dancers are great too. It's a very good DVD, very fun concert. Thank you Kylie for releasing DVDs very often, I have them all. Thanks again.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie has the most amazing look to it...like an animated Maxfield Parrish painting.  Neverland is full of lush, dense color, and peopled by all sorts of fantastical creatures, from the ever popular Tinkerbell to the beautiful, but feral mermaids.  The story stays pretty true to Barrie's original, with the emphasis on Wendy and a girl's sometimes frightening journey into womanhood.  And because of that emphasis, the tradition of having the same actor play Mr. Darling and Captain Hook has more resonance than ever.   <br /> <br />And what an actor.  Jason Isaacs is so good in each part that a viewer could mistake him for two different actors.  His Mr. Darling is a rather pathetically timid man, redeemed only by his obvious love for his wife and children.  His Captain Hook, on the other hand, encapsulates everything about adult males that gives Wendy pause as she contemplates growing up.  He's angry, vengeful, violent, even lustful.  But he's also attractive (Hook has amazing costumes and wigs, which provide a frame for Jason's wonderfully expressive eyes) and seductive and worldly, which gives him an appeal, even as he frightens her so badly. <br /> <br />It's really a great performance, because, through it, you can see that Hook is a mirror-image of Peter Pan. A funhouse mirror, but a mirror, nonetheless. Peter refuses to grow up and move on, and Hook refuses to let go of his grudge and move on. Peter doesn't respect adults, and Hook resents youth. Both are attracted to Wendy, because she exudes her own kind of power...the power to make a young man yearn to be better and an older man yearn to be young. They are locked in a combat that they simply refuse to relinquish, because they're both consumed by their lust for the fight. <br /> <br />All the performances in the movie range between very good and excellent.  Rachel Hurd-Wood is particularly charming and winsome as Wendy, and the Lost Boys are cute and funny.  Ludivine Sagnier is a very pretty, but also a veryarch and malevolent Tinkerbell.  The only occasional weak link is Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan.  He has a great look for the role and the youthful exuberance to make a convincing Pan, but his line delivery sometimes slips from cocky into smarmy, and it makes him a slightly less attractive figure. <br /> <br />Still, there is so much good about this movie--Jason, Rachel, the magnificent setpieces, and the attention to even the smallest detail, not to mention the classic story--that I gave it 5 stars.  The extras on the DVD are very nice, as well.  I recommend especially \\"Through the Eyes of Captain Hook\\", which is comprised of footage that Jason Isaacs shot on set, and the feature about the mermaids, which shows how much work went into creating a scene that lasted only a few seconds on-screen. <br />
B00005JOVN|3.0|Poseidon is not as bad as the critics say it is.  It's a decent movie, with very realistic special effects, atmospheric booming sounds of explosions and rushing water, and some impressive directing.  Two things that are bad about Poseidon, are....<br /><br />1. The bland talentless acting.<br /><br />2. And the story. (There isn't any)<br /><br />The movie starts off very quickly and goes straight into the action of the gigantic wave smashing into the titanic sized 'Poseidon', which is very impressive.  After the disaster (that kills nearly everybody) a group of survivors try to escape by making their way through the dangerous maze that is the upside down cruise ship.  And thats it.<br /><br />Characters are poor, with brief introductions it is hard to form a relationship with any of the cast.  Some characters you feel as if you don't care if they die a horrible death.  However, with Richard Dryfuss' and Kurt Russell's characters you do care if they live or die. (Maybe its because they are the only GOOD actors in this entire movie) Some deaths in the movie are very gruesome, but also funny.  With women smashing through glass, guys running around on fire and a dancefloor full of people being electrocuted by dangling power lines.  The music and the excellent audio makes every scene thrilling and exciting.  Other scenes evoke situations of panic towards the viewer.<br /><br />Overall, Poseidon is just an OK movie with minimal flaws.  Not a summer blockbusting hit, but more of a Sunday evening treat.  The director has made a brave attempt at remaking the original, but the questions are:<br /><br />Is it as good as the original?<br /><br />The answer:  .....No.<br /><br /> Is it better than Titanic?<br /><br />The answer: YES.
0307276902|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book, it was great writing, incredibly descriptive, and very engaging.  I respect Mr. Frey and feel somewhat bad for him now.  I do not believe he realized the harm lies could actually do to people in the depths of addiction as well as those in recovery.<br /><br />I lived a life similar, give or take a few indulging scenes.<br /><br />Addiction is painful, destructive, and as insane as this book describes.  However, recovery is indeed possible with individualized efective and competent treatment.<br /><br />Hopefully, Mr. Frey now realizes the importance of honesty and will continue on his spiritual path.<br /><br />I think enough is enough and we should practice forgiveness for this mistake.<br /><br />Recovery is a tough journey, lets not make it more difficult for James.<br /><br />Any comments or discussions please feel free to contcat me.
B000005Z0E|5.0|This is the pac that many people initially fell in love with. All political and less of the gangsta stuff that he never did. Pac spoke out against many things on this album and made a dope solo debut into the hip hop world. This album gives a message, dope lyrics and some decent beats. I love the later releases that pac had, but this one is a little more real due to the subject matter.
B000001FFJ|5.0|this is one of the coolest albums i own.  I think this is really where Waits started perfecting his stranger musical writings, but there's still plenty of room for the sligtely more normal songs of his earlier style.   <br /> <br />begining with the see shanty singapore, waits uses his idiosyncratic voice in a great way with the chanting, and the malets are awesome.  one of my favorites on the album is clap hands, which uses mallets again, but perhaps in an even cooler way than on singapore.  this song has some of the most interesting lyrics on the record, my favorite line being 'a Cincinatti jacket and a sad luck dame; hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain.' the song creates an atmosphere of the most exagerated old school urban decadence, completely grey and raw. cemetary polka sees chanting again, but somehow the style is quite different than on clap hands.   <br /> <br />to me the coolest part of the delivery of waits is his ability to use his voice to conjure so many different sounds and emotions.  this record goes from the delicacy of time to the surreal bark of cemetery polka, desperate and intense on anywhere i lay my head, and swinging and groving on walking spanish and jockey full of bourbon.  and just as his voice itself is varried, so too are the song styles, instrumentation, and overall feel the songs give off.  somehow waits is able to go from popular music to avant garde strangness so fast and so smoothly that he creates a sound totaly his own on totaly different songs.  if you told me waits had multiple personality disorder problems around the recording of this record i might believe you.     <br /> <br />as this record is in the middle of his discography i think it is one of the most essential, it just showcases so much. one thing i think people have to realize is that there wasn't a perfect point when Waits started playing very strange music, and to me that slowely happened until his albums became more consistantly in one style again.  some of the songs here are very weird, such as diamonds and gold, but others are pop songs, such as downtown train. i suppose not everyone will feel this is a good thing, this album doesn't have the emotional or concistancy, nor the pure strangness of an album like Blood Money, but it probably has better songs.  get it.
0385336691|4.0|I am a fan of Lee Child books and I have enjoyed each one. I would have liked to see more detail about how Edward Lane and his men were able to capture two men and a women that were armed with machine guns in a fortified house. I rated the book a 4 star.
006441034X|5.0|I consider myself picky about the books I like....This one was right up my alley.  While trying to find books to fill the void while waiting for the next Harry Potter to come out, my nephew told me about Howl.  I was surprised that it was written in 1987 (which would put me in highschool) and I'd never heard of it before.  Well, I loved it.  It has a little of everything....romance, humor, mystery and lots of magic!   <br /> <br />Sophie is the oldest of 3 sisters and therefore (in her mind) doomed to a life of bad luck and boredom.  She accepts her fate as a hat maker in her family's shop until the dreaded Witch of the Waste visits her store and in a fit of temper, turns Sophie into an old woman and furthermore the curse won't allow Sophie to tell anyone what happened to her. <br /> <br />Sophie has no choice but to leave the shop and seek her fortune.  She decides to go to Wizard Howl (A handsome and powerful, but incredibly conceited wizard who lives in a castle that is fueled by a fire demon) in hopes that he can remove the spell.   <br /> <br />Howl is the most interesting character.  He is vain and selfish and just when you think you hate him, he turns kind and compassionate.  By the end of the book, you can see how Sophie falls in love with him.  They are a perfect match for each other. <br /> <br />The book can be complicated for younger readers (I even found myself re-reading particularly difficult chapters to make sure I had grasped them) I also found myself coming up with questions that don't seem to be answered in the book.  However, all in all, I thought the book was imaginitive and entertaining.  It's full of colorful characters and creative plots!
6305922756|5.0|This first \\"mockumentary\\" is a treat to watch, chronicling the (invented) adventures of the rock group Spinal Tap, \\"Britain's loudest band.\\" <br /> <br />Filled with a host of comedic talent, there's much to laugh at in this film, but one of its great strengths (and what sets it apart from the team's later mockumentaries such as Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show) is that it is never too absurd to be believed. The characters in this film are absolutely believable and the situations they get themselves in are, too (like the stage malfunctions, and the cancelled bookings). <br /> <br />This is a movie that never gets old, and it's recommended for all fans of comedy and music. Five stars.
B000ELIVB0|5.0|Wow. This is captivating stuff: like artists such as M83, the Knife's Silent Shout has a \\"future noir\\" sound that brings drama, depth and vibrancy to the stereotypically sterile elements of electronic music.   Simultaneously combining female, male, and high-pitched alien (!) layers within the same voice, the eerie pitch-shifted vocals give the melodies a slippery strangeness that is also surprisingly powerful.  \\"Marble House\\", for example, soars with a chorus that is both heartbreaking and uplifting; \\"Forest Families\\" is like the evil step-sister to Ladytron's \\"Soft Power\\";  \\"Neverland\\" thumps along on a catchy yet otherwordly beat; and \\"The Captain\\" combines atmospheric instrumentation with a haunting chirp of a vocal that will send shivers down your spine.  True, the lyrics on this album are a bit oblique and sometimes hard to decipher (\\"We had a communist in the family / I had to wear a mask\\"); but lyrics are not the point here as much as generating an emotion in the listener.  And on that level, the Knife have definitely succeeded -- I can't stop listening to this album, and I definitely can't forget its effect on me.  One of the best of the year so far.
B000069KE0|5.0|i first heard 25 or 6 to 4 when our stage band played it at music camp. my dad heard us, and the next week he brought this home. it's one of the best hard rock with horns songs i have ever heard. <br /> <br />there's plenty more great things here, too. the road and the country are 2 of my favorites, along with poem for the people, fancy colors, and it better end soon(especially the last 30 seconds or so, crazy brass going on). <br /> <br />and of course, there's make me smile and color my world, both movements from \\"ballet for a girl in buchannon\\". all classic. <br /> <br />the classical type ones near the end are a bit slow for me, but still really pretty. <br /> <br />bonus tracks are the single versions of make me smile and 25 or 6 to 4. they're not better, just shorter and make me smile's missing the intro. not necessary, but you get to hear them twice. woo! <br /> <br />if you like this get the first one to. apparently everything after this is not so good.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|I think I'm one of the few people who wasn't smitten with the single, \\"S.O.S.\\" For some reason, the song never caught on with me - what can I say? Anyhow, that single aside, I really am enjoying this album. I just got it a few weeks ago as a grad gift and I like it. I don't own Rihanna's first album, but now I'm tempted to buy it. Dance fans who enjoyed \\"Pon de Replay\\" and the aformentioned \\"S.O.S.\\" might be disappointed as this album is a little heavy on the ballads, and although I'm not a huge fan of ballads in general,the ones on here are pretty good. There are quite a few songs on here that could stand alone as radio singles. It's a good album.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|they're the beatles. i like the red + blue albums better, but it's all good. even my least favorites, like love me do + ballad of john & yoko, i still love. the beatles are amazing and if you think they suck no one really cares what you think anyway :P <br /> <br />to all those reviewers who give 1 star & reccomend \\"better\\" bands, please stop. how stupid can you be to be talking about \\"overrated\\" then recommend green day? they're ok too i guess, but you should know better than that. silly. <br /> <br />i know it's supposed to be #1s, but i miss a day in the life, i saw her standing there, twist and shout, in my life, with a little help from my friends, here comes the sun, and a lot more. <br /> <br />ok, fine, i want everything.
