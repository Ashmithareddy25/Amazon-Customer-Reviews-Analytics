B000FC10IO|4.0|Garth Nix wrote an excellent trilogy and wrapped it up beautifully in Abhorsen.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the fantasy genre.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|We laughed a lot while we were watching Ted, it was pretty funny. A little silly at times but a good laugh.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love the really great app. I couldn't live without it.  thank you for making the app. ill see you later
B009LUAR0I|5.0|Ask anyone that knows me and they will tell you I am very critical of musical performances but what this man is capable of musically just astounds me. I don't normally like love songs (requited or unrequited) and this entire album is about love songs and each song just takes my breath away. It delves into the overwhelming of, the destruction of, and even the ability to love oneself. Just listen and enjoy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid: the third wheel is just as amazing as all the other books. I say it's a good read.
B009CGAMK6|4.0|Les Miserables is the top of my list for musicals not written by Sondheim. I was overwhelmed by every performance with one extreme exception. I didn't think that Nick Jonas belonged among this cast of exceptional performers. Perhaps someday with more training he might have a chance of being worthy of some of them but he didn't cut it at all. It was purely a decision to pull in the younger crowd. However the Star performance was Norm Lewis. When the show started and he came out I was incredibly annoyed because I was being close minded and he didn't look the part. Then he sang and I Stopped breathing. He has the most beautiful voice that I have ever heard and even my sibling who tends to dislike musicals sat with me and rewatched &#34;stars&#34; multiple times just to hear him sing. The rest of the cast was almost as good.
B007SGM084|4.0|Is not the greatest book but no the worse either, and even though we all think is only for girls I think man can learn a couple of things from MR Grey lol !!!  Very interesting book
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game makes you think on some of the puzzles. Good games for kids. They learn how to put together the colored dots.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this story was so good!  I actually gave myself a migraine reading it so obsessively; and it was worth it :)
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I found this book to be very insightful into how this mans life was when he was a child. It reflects how things are in different countries and was a very compelling and emotional book. I day you should read and try it out!
B00633W614|5.0|The book was very well paced with all the different characters and plots.  It held my interest throughout.  I'd recommend it to anyone, especially Jeffery Archer fans.
B0089BSOPA|4.0|Before I weigh in on this understand this is just one persons opinion and understand taste is subjective. I really liked this special edition but wished the Directors Cut was included instead of the TV version. The directors cut had scaled back the violence and had an alternate ending, the TV version seems to have been cut from that version. The TV version which I have never seen until now seems a bit of a mess to me. Some of the scenes are run out of sequence and a lot of UN-necessary dialogue has been added to pad out the running time for television. With that said I think this deluxe package is pretty good, with the theatrical release and some good interviews from some of the people behind the movie. I think I like this movie more with this release. Still would love to find the Directors Cut on DVD someday.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love all of the books in the series but this one is the best<br /><br />I hope another book will come out
B0058VW36U|5.0|Both my kids, ages 5 and 10, are having so much fun with cut the rope. They each have it on their kindle now, and it was so worth it. I didn't realize this game involved thinking and analysis as to the process of getting the candy to the adorable monster. It reminds me of the alligator/water game.
B005HSL626|3.0|IT IS A LITTLE YOUNG FOR ME BUT SINCE I JUST HAD A STROKE  IT IS HELPING ME TO GET BACK THE USE OF MY RIGHT HAND
0345803485|1.0|Thought it was a peice of junk. Thought it was a peice of junk.Thought it was a peice of junk.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I am a young newlywed. I prefer not to see older people struggle with their marital sexuality. Nor do I like to pay to watch it played out on the big screen.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Exciting from beginning to end!  Connelly holds my interest in every Harry Bosch novel.  Angels Flight holds the suspense and ends with a solid display of fireworks!  Harry, to me, is a real individual; he feels emotion and always takes the high road no matter the outcome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A good book<br /> Uhhhjjjnnnnn hubbub j j h h h h h h huh h h h h h b
6305428425|5.0|This movie is just funny. I loved this when I was a kid. I used to watch it all the time. Good movie!<br /><br />Movie Description:<br />Romy and Michele are roommates in California. They are best friends, with no boyfriends. Michele is a funny, not really smart with no job kinda person. While Romy is the one with a job, and the smarts. But then they realize that there ten year high school reunion is coming up in to weeks. Then they realize that their lives are not impressive as they thought it was. So they decide to do all these impossible things in less than two weeks. Do they succeed in impressing the people that they have went to high school with? Or will they figure out that who honestly cared?<br /><br />I recommend this movie. I have already watched it eight times, and will continue to watch it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Not something in the genre that I would usually get but it was informative.  However, it did give me some insite on how the seal teams operate.  The most interesting (and amusing) fact was how why and how the seals were created.  Oh yes, the name, what a hoot.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have every one of Patricia Cornwells' books, either on Kindle or hardback. The Bone Bed is an okay read but seems a little disjointed in places, the conversations are stilted and seem to be more of a formal recitation rather than &#34;normal&#34; conversation. Of course, with Kay Scarpetta some recitation is needed during an examination. However, it is not needed in conversational periods. Dialogue and events in this book just do not seem to hold my attention because of the style of writing. My style of reading is complete immersion in the story; I was not able to achieve that in this book. Not my favorite of her books. I would compare it a bit to Isle of Dogs because it wasn't one of my favorites either.<br />Having said that, Ms. Cornwell is an excellent writer and I will continue reading her as long as she keeps writing!
B00371QQ0M|3.0|This movie is hard to rate. Generally they did a good job of condensing the book to a movie for the most part, but I have some major gripes (which I won't bore you with). Any Dune fan will probably have similar mixed feelings. I watched it my father-in-law who found it &#34;interesting&#34;. He drew a lot of comparisons to real life, but he couldn't get the real plot of the book since the movie fails miserably in the last few minutes while it tries to make a happy ending. For example, the ending voice-over says Paul brings peace and harmony to the universe. If you've read Dune, and you were drinking liquid while reading this review, you'll be getting a towel to wipe down your monitor now.<br /><br />Anyway, it's worth the price for a Dune fan to just see this thing. For everyone else, skip it and read the damn book already!
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|Really fun game,  but it has problems saving progress.  I saved 100,000 points twice for most expensive jet pack and the game did not save my purchase.  Also,  clothing I bought and was wearing reverted to unpurchased.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|much better than what was originally shipped, this is an actual app and not just a link to the website!
B007MJSSCY|4.0|This series has a lot to recommend it.  It's set in two interesting time periods.  The setting is a beautiful English manor with georious countryside.  The characters are wonderfully believable.  The story is unique, capturing our interest.  The only negative thing about it is we aren't quite sure what audience it is aimed toward.  It is a little below an adult level and a little more than what I would allow my children to watch.  If it has a little more detail and depth, I would have enjoyed it much more.  As it is,  it would be too frightening for my children to watch.  But all in all, it s a good series.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a good book, enjoyed it lots and recommend it to all readers who like stories about life long ago.
B000KE1PDC|5.0|Dickens is always good-- this miniseries captured the essence of the book.  The humor, the melancholoy, the bleak and the brightness.  The characterizations were perfect.  Whole-heartedly recommend this miniseries.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have just finished Hopeless. I read it in one day because I could not put it down. I laughed and cried a lot. It was so good. I recommend this book for anyone who loves a romance that has a lot of heart. It has many twists and  turns. It is so fearless and funny and tragic and wonderful and horrible and sweet and loving and thoughtful. There are not enough words to describe how fantastic it is!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works like a charm. I could play it all day! No complaints here. I'm gonna keep playing now...have a nice day.
B000HKW7E0|2.0|I never watched this movie when I was a kid and that's probably the biggest issue I have with the film. If you're not going into this with any kind of nostalgia, honestly, the movie is just not that good. I'm worried for everyone on here who refers to this thing as \\"hilarious.\\" If by \\"hilarious\\" they mean, mildly amusing at a select few points, then yes. But really, if you've never seen this movie before then save yourself the trouble and watch A Christmas Story for the billionth time instead.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great story that connects two generations of women with unexpected twiists along with insight into life in London during the Blitz.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|(500) Days of Summer is a movie I can relate to. While watching it, many, many scenes felt very similar to past experiences, and I bet many guys (and maybe girls) will relate to as well. This movie has a different feel than the usual romantic comedy, where characters are put into situations that are unlikely to happen, and in some way, have created unrealistic expectations for people.<br /><br />Here we have a story, where we see how a relationship sort of develops and falls apart, making you realize that the person you loved wasn't all perfect when you look back. Yet, it's not all somber. It shows how people move, make professional and personal changes, opening new opportunities. Highly recommended! I still have hope someday I'll get to the point of the ending scene :)
B001JRB16U|5.0|My grandaughter was elated Mee-Maw brought the gift that Santa didn't have in his bag of goodies.  Good quality!! A classic movie for children of all ages from 3-103.
B00371XIP8|5.0|Saints I and Saints II... Hopefully one day they will make Saints III!  Plenty of action - humor - everything guys want.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|we did not finished watching ,amazon had to rewind it to a piint we stoped watching the movie,, not very good &#62;&#62;
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|If the movie was HD I think that you guys should make it surround sound plus subtitles...<br />other companies does....
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Pretty good film. Great pacing with the story. Considering there are soo many comic book hero films lately, this one is good. The chemistry between all of them is good.
1402793375|5.0|It is fine, I have not finished it yet.  CM  Easy to hold in paperback.  I have not ordered a book from Amazon, unless I have forgotten.  The book 'Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee' was recommended to me.  CM
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the easiest solitaire game ever. Intuitive play action makes for quick games. Great take-along when waiting for appointments.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Can't wait for more books. I'm sad that I'm such a fast reader and it's all over. A must read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a download for the Kindle, but received very prompt.  Did not have to worry about shipping because it was automatically delivered as soon as it was paid for.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. It takes time and patience to play so I don't finish fast. The dragons are adorable and have cute quirks. Its fun to breed them too. So many different kinds of dragons!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|This was a Christmas present for a Broadway fan, who was very happy to receive it and played it right away.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Provides me with all that I need in a free display clock for my kindle. I also love the simple to use features including the alarm clock.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|This movie should have a rating of NC-17 and I cant believe they actually spent the money to make this horrible movie that no person in their right mind would agree to make.
B006O3MU96|4.0|Instructions:<br />There should be instructions on how to play. I figured it out after trying playing to 4 games.I enjoyed playing it
B0039UTDFG|5.0|Great series, the visuals are spectacular in high def!!<br />I definitely recommend this series.  It gives you great information and is beautiful to watch.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|enjoyed every minute excellent musical. I would recommend this movie for all ages. I saw this at the movies when I was a little girl and it was even better in my own home.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This is a awesome movie. the special effects were great and the actors were great. ridley scott did a great job directed this movie. the aliens in this movie were pretty cool. is this the prelude to aliens? mabey or mabey not who knows. all in all this is a great movie. i hope they do a sequel because they left it open for another one. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B003O86FMW|5.0|Usually, I am disappointed in sequels. however this is turning out to be one of the best series I have read in a while. a delight for all ages, an adventure of sorts and a brilliant continuation of a unique and dark idea. If you enjoyed the first of the trilogy, this book will not disappoint. A must read!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|awesome game . best angry birds yet ! what game will they come up with next ? and yes, I would recommend this game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Even the second time.  I had this book in paperback and let a friend read it.  I purchased it again with my new Kindle Fire HD that I got from my husband this Christmas.  Read again with just as much enthusiasm as the first time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love a unique story line that I can't predict and this book has it. All 3 of this author's books are original and highly enjoyable. I would happy pay more for her books then some of the more well known authors that charge $12+ for an e book. Colleen Hover has me addicted and I can't wait for her next one!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I aways thought this was a stupid game...until I played it.  I can't put it down! I love this game!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This book was good...Not great but good. I found myself skipping over some parts because they were drawn out, but at the same time this book made you reflect.
B0053O89WY|5.0|good as ever, jim parsons is always great, and we love  the other characters as well. we can't wait until the next season is available.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|I purchased this as a gift, and honestly it was so much better than I thought it would be.  The way the piece opens up to display the movies is actually pretty cool.  I don't want to hear about those complaining about how sturdy it is; show me one movie case that is!  The way it pulls up from the inside is pretty awesome, and the receiver was like a kid on Christmas (a big kid on Christmas) eyes lit up and he played with his cyborg.  Great deal, great price, great gift.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|its great.!!!!!!!!  thank you.  better than the first one.  it had so many stars in it than i thought.  loved it.
B00A0R42L6|5.0|This was my first purchase for my son's Kindle Fire HD Xmas gift and it was well worth the wait!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|its great!!  johnny Depp is great in everything he does. he also puts a little humor in everything.  He did a great job. thank you. I love Amazon.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I do not recommend this film to anyone looking to watch a good film with good acting and things that make sense, like when a trained cop or a super droid shoots at them, they would probably be dead right?...oh no, you won't get that here. It's cheesy, lots of cliches, bad acting, etc. Just wait till it comes out on TV and you'll thank me.
0425263908|4.0|I heard that if I enjoyed the 50 Shades trilogy that I would also enjoy Bared to You. Although initially I thought Bared was similar to the 50 Shades Triliogy, as I continued to read I realized there was more suspense & drama, which I enjoyed. Cannot wait for the final book to be released.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Don't download the application crashes all the time I'm not happy at all<br />find a better then this one trust me it sucks camera HD why do u do this to us time to keep looking for a better app
B0094BB4TW|5.0|its just like regular facebook!  I read some comments and they aren't happening when I use it. I'm using A Kindle Fire by the way. its an excellent app
0071422943|5.0|Very detailed. Essential for any chemical engineering course. A massive tome of facts. Pages and pages of calculations and tables.
1419705849|5.0|My son has all the books. These are funny and fabulous if you did not know buy wimpy kid and you won't regret it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Loved this book!! Reading of all the hardships that Abby and Travis went through and they still were together in the end..though I think there's a lot more to Travis that isn't said in this book. All in all a good read.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is a perfect mmo to take with you anywhere. It's super fun and a breath of fresh air from WoW.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is an amazing choice for readers. A great addition to the Wimpy Kid series,and I hope other children will enjoy it too.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Absolutely love the show. Each season is better than the last. The twists and turns of the characters leave me speechless.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book was a great book. It only took me three and a half days to read. I couldn't stop reading! Definitely recommend this book!
B00992CF6W|4.0|The Pocket Edition of Minecraft just needs multiplayer for me to give it the 5 star rating. You can play with someone via local WiFi but that's not enough. As I said great game but missing the multiplayer feature.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I laughed the whole way through. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a good laugh.
B001IYVUEW|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining.  Nothing that will stay with you forever like with Lost or Battlestar Galactica but worth the price of a rental.  Katie Holmes is particularly good in this.
B00656C6KK|5.0|No problems with this order.  More words required is just ticking me off.  More words required is just ticking me off.
B001I189MQ|4.0|Would have been better with Katie Holmes.  Otherwise a fine movie for a little entertainment.  It's no Lost or Battlestar Galactica though!
B005HSL626|5.0|My granddaughter and I both compete against each other in the arcade mode and have a ball..she on her kindle and I on mine!
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I needed a spare pair of batteries for my Canon 5D dslr.  These batteries are working perfectly for me.  Excellent!
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Some of the best ideas I've seen for getting all resisting human bits to harmonize toward achieving a common goal and improving lives, singlyand as a group.
1423134206|5.0|I have the set of books now.  Imagine being able to stop a classic Disney animation and appreciate it shot by shot.  I love to analyze images. This book has a very good printing process with large images.  My mom grew up drawing characters from Fantasia, so I got one for her too.  Much better after the price went fro $60 to $30 or there abouts.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great show !!! What a great show, hopes this show continues.  Great plot, family drama, brooding sidekick, what more can you ask for?
0425252868|5.0|Heard about this on NPR and I am so glad I was able to catch it and get this book.  I encourage all of you who have no idea what war is really about to read this.  Excellent read!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I found a kinship in Cheryl's journey and lostness that I didn't understand at first. Her writing is so powerful that I felt as if I traveled with her. Loved the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really a fun game, esp. while traveling by plane.  Keeps my husband busy when he doesn't feel like reading too much.
0425252868|5.0|one of the greatest world war 2 stories which is true and honorable. \\"a higher call\\" a b-17 was badly shot up and a german fighter pilot went to shoot the bomber down but instead of shooting the plane down the pilot showed remarkable courage aand escourted him to his allied lines so the bomber pilot could get home alive. this is a remakable story. the pilot came home after the war and went to germany sent some adds into some of the papers so the american pilot could get in touch and meet with the german ace and both the american and german pilot were able to meet and become friends and the american pilot was able to find out why the german pilot was able to not shoot down the american plane fasinating story.
1423140605|5.0|My granddaughter has read the other books in the series and was excited to receive the book .<br />You guys rock!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is hilarious!<br />Rented on Amazon, after watching it I decided to put this on my purchase list.<br />Great family movies are hard to find. Thank you Will Ferrell for all the laughs!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I adore the Pendergast novels and this one doesn't disapppoint.  Continues the tale with plenty of suspense and action. Ya gotta love the characters, plot and excitement.
B004VUP8WK|3.0|George is proudly and self admittedly \\"from another planet\\". And by the term \\"another planet\\" I mean \\"so far assured of his own self worth and releveance by the adjulations of his fans for the past 27 years\\" that he can put out an album that his fans hate and still go on tour to pay his bills because his earlier body of work seemed more original and less derived enough keep a paying audience perpetually coming back for an encore of the old favorites. As MA have progressed from their inertial sound they have blended old ground w/new ground but this outing is 10-20 years too late. Even listening now it is obvious that George was in charge of this sonic MA debacle. Blame or congratulate him as your fancy suits you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down!!!!!!!!I was so caught up in the story I finished it in a day! Suzanne Collins is now one of my favorite authors. Can't wait to read Catching Fire!!!!!
0439023491|4.0|Great young adult novel!  The story is fun, but the biggest disappointment, in my opinion, is the main characters developement..  I get that she internalizes alot of her feelings, but at the same time she still comes across as wooden, callous.  I really never got to &#34;like her&#34;.  I wanted to care about her...but I just couldn't.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|As a self proclaimed Disney movie aficionado, I must say that this one of my favorites, ever. I really love the New Orleans setting!
0439023513|3.0|As written in my review of book 2, I enjoyed the story, until the end.  And I still couldn't care about the caracter.  Nothing she did inspired me to like her.  Nothing.  The twist at the end was unexpected, but right before that I was like &#34;WTF just happend!?&#34; because the story was going well...and then just went sideways.  I was really disappointed in how it went.  But I was more disappointed that I couldn't care about the character.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Great edition to any Castle fan's collection. It's nice to watch it without the hassle of fast-forwarding through commercials and such. Fast delivery too!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Love the stories in this book.  I am very grateful that there are men and women willing to do this to keep us safe.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I find all of his books interesting.  They keep you in guessing till the yery last on the outcome.  Very good.
B009E2WX3W|4.0|Peter Gabriel is great, so what's not to like about this? It's a nice range of his talent too! It's relaxing music and brings back memories :-)
B001EYGOEM|4.0|kids loved it.  Would buy cd from this source at any time.  good product ...good price.  Product arived on time and in good conndition
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is great the hole family play's it and we are not young people.My sister started it and then got me started and we are in our 80's my brother is in his 70's and guess what can't stop him so I would say it's quite A game.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This &#34;full&#34; story of a man, complete with his ups and downs gives everyone hope...and insight to why some are born different than others...including his wife and now his legacy lives on in his children...
B0063IH60K|3.0|It could be better as it's to easy to win. Play A few games and then you win. Need to make it A little more difficult to win then it's more interesting.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This is the second Sophie Kinsella book I have borrowed, and I'm hooked.  I love her characters and her books are so easy to read. Can't wait for the next one.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I love this movie and it's 60's theme music. The crazyiness of the plot, the humor and of Johnny as vampire are perfect. I sent a copy to my son so he wouldn't miss it.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Recommended by my sister - and the guy at the AT&T store - somewhat difficult to get on and off, (be sure to watch the how to videos online) but worth it since your phone basically lives in the case anyway. Everything works except the speaker phone is not great through the case - everything else is great and I'm no longer paranoid about breaking my phone. More colors/patterns to choose from would be nice.<br />Forgot to mention - purchased new - but original packaging had been opened and re-taped. Product inside looked new and untampered with.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was one of the coolest books that I have  ever read besides the Harry Potter books,<br />If read good books but The Hunger Game's
B00457X7IQ|3.0|In this second installment of the series, the story grinds to a hold right in the beginning of the book. Where you would expect things to be explained/revealed, they just don't. The introduction of 2 new characters is not done very smoothly, all of the sudden they are just there. Don't get me wrong, you will still want 2 know what happens, but the book could be better
B003O86FMW|5.0|I recommend this book to all ages. Once you pick up this book you can not put it down. Thinking far my favorite book of the series! Collins is able to draw you into the story an write about real people and their struggles along with the war in the district's. This was the third time I have read this book and I plan to read it even more in the future!
B0086700CM|4.0|My grandchildren love that I got this game for my kindle fire.  They want to play with it all the time
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This has great acting --(with Charlize Theron you'd expect nothing else), but the movie is a bit violent -- not for children.
B00APUQT7I|2.0|No even close to the first 2. There is no real story. Disjointed. Even scrat was not funny. The director lost track of the comedy from the first one
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I absolutly love this movie. The product came in perfect condition and i could not be happier with my purchase.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Pulled all the Bourne movies together. Loved this one. Chase scenes were pretty incredible. Highly recommend this for action movie lovers.
0142501123|5.0|Kindergarteners are all about making friends and sharing.  This is a great book for developing those concepts.  My 5-yr old loves this book.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Great movie. Fantastic writing and acting. One of the best that the Brat Pack has ever done.  Hilarious, sad, and life learning.  I would recommend this movie for fans of all ages.
B003SNKBXW|4.0|Once again, the author writes a book that has you guessing right up to the very end. His books never disappoint. What was disappointing was that no one seems to have proofed this book after sending it through the OCR software. I don't know how many times Paris became Pans. Many, many of these errors making it difficult to read at times. Punctuation disappears and words are restructured. Very distracting. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Makes me gain more interest in the TV series ...  Castle.  This was a well written mystery with lots of intrigue.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Useless application!  With the lens on the front, there's no way to see what you are taking, or to conveniently actually take the photo.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic book. I watched the movie and I knew the book would be even better. I was right!!! It's a brilliant book and I recommend it.
B005LAII3U|2.0|There was no discernible plot, even less character development and a complete absence of a coalesced underlying meaning to tie the numerous scenes together to convey a unified theme.<br /><br />At the end one is left not knowing what really happened and what's worse...one doesn't care, but one does appreciate that it is indeed OVER.<br /><br />Watch the Arnold version again and pretend that it's the newer version.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This app worked great, sync'd well with my other devices and pretty much did all that I could ask.  Then along came the update (read all the other reviews regarding the update).  Multiple problems have occurred: the Yahoo! icon is now just a gray blob (I could live with this), slooooow uploads of email, says it deleted email, but it really hasn't, cannot remove old empty folders from the created folder screen, etc.  Thought I would give Yahoo a few days to debug, but things have not gotten any better.  I do like the new format and think this may have potential...  However, I am so frustrated that I am going to remove the app.  Maybe I will reload it when reviews regarding the update start improving???
B008518MOW|5.0|Amongst the biggest issues with this dying franchise was the repetitious second installment which literally pulled all it's virtues from the first flick.  The inevitable outcome, lack of creativity, same ol' same 'ol.<br /><br />Then along comes Men in Black 3D and I was completely taken with the movie.  The acting is great, young 'K' is beyond expectations and the whole movie circles back to an outstanding ending...truly!!!  The video and audio are reference quality and the 3D presentation is outstanding!  Highly Recommended.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|My son loved it.  I wish it was closer to the book, but I understand the changes and why they had to make them.  All and all a great movie for people of all ages with a great message!

B004C3DLJ8|5.0|We've been watching the Toy Story movies since my oldest was a young boy. We watched this as a family and all loved it. It tied up the story lines in a satisfying way and had all 4 of us (aged 20 to 55) in tears at some point--from nostalgia and a genuine love for the characters.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked all the action and suspense from start to end. Enjoyed the action. Love the plot.The book was much better than the movie! I would recommend it to friends to read

B0084U0IEG|5.0|McEwans storytelling once again grips the reader in quiet absorption that doesn't let up until the final page is turned.  It is not the suspense or a startling revelation that makes Sweet Tooth another fantastic novel, but rather the authors deep understanding of human desires, motivation, and troubled sense of identity.  The cover of espionage and betrayal makes it all palatable and cohesive.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Enjoyed this series very much.  I read the whole series in less then a month!!!  I wish she would continue the series.
B008PPUMVY|5.0|This is a great album that is a really good example of Zappa at his best. Excellent musicianship combined with a story-telling style that is funny and depthful.

B00838F4IE|5.0|this is one of the books that made me become in love with physics, it was a fun read and made me study Physics and will make it my major in university. I recommend it to anyone Who thinks god is needed in the Universe because this book shows you that you don't need a magical mythological Person in the sky to understand or explain the World because you don't need one. the universe is very beautiful as it is. Thank you professor Lawrence Krauss!
B004N66XYE|5.0|Really a nice follow-up to the original series. Picks up in the 1930's leading up to WWII. Looking forward to season 2 and more.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Original ending.  Never saw it coming. Too many books in this genre tend to fizzle in the end.  This book did not disappoint.
0385474547|3.0|My child needed this book for school. Easy ordering, fast shipment, sent just as described. So much easier than trying to find it at a store. My teenager didn't enjoy the book though.

1451620829|4.0|courtesy of [...]    by the Matman    Like the Beatles, KISS had four distinct personalities within the original band. In any interviews I ever saw, drummer Peter Criss (the Catman) always seemed to be the most humble and honest with his feelings. Sadly, his life and music career were deeply affected by drug and alcohol excess. For years I wondered when Mr. Criss would put his life story to paper and reveal what exactly happened to him.    `Makeup To Breakup: My Life In And Out Of Kiss' is Peter's story; a kid who fought to survive on the streets of New York, clawed his way to the top of the music world, lost it, replaced some and then turned his back on everything. This book is honest to a fault and gives you a new perspective on the KISS story that seems to be constantly rewritten with Peter's contributions diminished each time.    For Peter, the rise of KISS seemed to bring more problems than anything else. With each rung of success he felt outvoted and constantly fighting to show his creativity. This ended with him sabotaging his final years in KISS as well as self-destructive behavior and drug and alcohol abuse.    After reading the book I felt I had a better understanding of Peter, the inner workings of the KISS machine and the 1970's hedonistic lifestyles. Peter (with contributor Larry Sloman) goes into serious detail about all things KISS, marriage, groupies and bad decisions. The language can be crude and descriptions leaving little to the imagination, but he is honest about his feelings. Where Gene Simmons' book was boastful, Ace Frehley's was just sad, Peter's examines the soul. He tells it like it is when it comes to Gene and Paul Stanley's domination of the band, Ace's betrayal and the stupid things he did that ruined two marriages.    The part of the book I was most interested in was his solo music career after he left KISS. Peter tells of the frustration of having his first two solo records bomb and subsequent projects meet with no luck as well. You could see that the success and adulation Criss had from the single `Beth' had more of a negative effect on him than a positive. More than the respect as an artist, the song became the validation of his arguments with Paul and Gene and ultimately started his downward spiral.    Congratulations to the Catman for an amazing book. And more importantly on surviving to tell the tale!    Matman Rating: 4 out of 5 cat lives!

B008TMA1LY|4.0|I like this game a lot...but as you progress you can drive yourself crazy trying to keep up. You can upgrade your characters and tables but after a while it requires the hello Kitty coins and you will need more help. Ive been playing it a while I'm on level 17 and I only have three characters helping me. It also takes forever to get more help because it takes forever to get 400-300 hello Kitty coins.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Just what I expected and a perfect gift for someone who loves this kind of thing. Would recommend to anyone.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|excellent product! the sound track is great for 7.1 set ups. and i enjoyed the inter active setup that explains the plot. i think this will help some people understand the plot, and for those of us that get it its a nice tidbit to throw in.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|That's really anyone could say about this book. Amazing. It made me angry and hurt. But it also made me smile, laugh, and cry.<br />It's hard not to throw your self into this book head first, I could not put it down and literally read all night.<br /><br />The ending was magical, that last little bit was just the most perfect thing that could have closed this book.<br /><br />Who knew the pinky holding was so significant :)<br />To me this book was a must read I'm so glad I found it!!!!!!

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Looking for a quick read? I didn't expect it to be as it was but was very happy with the book! Would be a great summer beach read!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|To me it is so rare for a book to get this many 5 star ratings,  but how could it not. After such great books in Slammed and Point of Retreat, Hopeless does not disappoint. Holder and Sky are both unbeleivable characters. I still can't get over Holders tattoo. How fitting. Well done once again!!!!
B000HC2LI0|4.0|We are big fans of the West Wing--it's a terrific show.  However, as other reviews have stated, although the packaging LOOKS nice, it is not functional.  We are placing the discs in another container so they don't get scratched. Still, we are enjoying watching this fantastic show once again.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I have always been captivated by the story of The Duke and Duchess of Windsor. In &#34;W.E&#34; Madonna weaves a tale of dual stories in the past and present tellin the famous story from the point of view of The Duchess and a young woman obsessed with her in modern day New York.<br /><br />Everything about the film is perfect. It is beautiful to look at, historically interesting and thought provoking. The acting raises the bar even higher. There was not a second of this film that I was bored or not totally drawn in.<br /><br />What is most profound about &#34;W.E&#34; is that because it was a Madonna project, it was automatically panned by critics. What a shame that is. Luckily, however, the story lives on in DVD and will find its captive audience.<br /><br />Madonna should be very proud of this film. Its a stunning work of art.
0316069434|5.0|There is no disappointment with Michael Connelly's books. The story is riveting and as usual I read it is two days.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. As usual, this actor gives you your money's worth. Strongly recommend to all fans of J. Depp
B0063IH60K|5.0|I take it in the car... nice to have along on a trip. My husband said it keeps me busy when he's driving.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|J. Depp is wonderful in this role. Displays the original tv series in a modern way. I recommend you check it out.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|Though my grandchildren are young, because they love Legos so much I bought this.  Both they and her parents love it.  There are many small parts so supervision is needed for younger children.  Many cute little people.  One piece of advice! If this is meant to be a gift and needs to be mailed, I HIGHLY advocate having the set mailed directly to gift receiver's home. I had wanted to gift wrap it myself for Christmas and then send it.  Bad idea. The box is bigger than it appears in pictures and can not be mailed in a medium or large Flat Rate Box with the USPS. Very expensive to mail.
B007MJSQSK|2.0|Great animation, cheesy storyline. The story could have been written better. Some of the characters were annoying and made it hard to watch all the way through. I couldn't finish it to the end.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All I know about it is that my son-in-law was extremely excited when I gave it to him for Christmas!.  He thinks it's marvelous.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|I have not read any of the books, so I don't know if I should have expected such a small amount of action from an 'action movie.' There were two, maybe three brief action scenes throughout the entire two and a half hour running time. The other 90% of the movie was just talking heads. The dialogue was either boring or laughably unrealistic for a gritty crime thriller. (Example: Jack Reacher:  \\"I will beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot!\\") The whole movie was a contrived, boring, convoluted mess. Frankly, I'm kind of pissed that I paid to see it.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Even though I cancelled the order for &#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; that I ordered from Amazon Digital Services, Inc., I reordered &#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; from Amazon.com. to be used as a Christmas gift.  I was told you did not put this in my Video Library because the order was cancelled.  I did not cancel the DVD order.  It should have been put in my Video Library.  I did not watch it because it was used as a Christmas gift.  I really would appreciate it if you would put in in my Video Library so that I could watch it.  I have talked to two different Amazon employees that just can not understand my problem.<br /><br />I do hope you can correct this mistake.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I thought this was a nice twist on history.  The kids love anything with Vampires.  I can't say this is masterpiece, but it was enjoyable.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|The settings and plot of this novel kept me enthralled throughout most of the book.  Perhaps the ending was a little obvious?  I still found it a very enjoyable read.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read the prelude, and I have to say I can see why the author got the tongue lashing he did.  You just have to remember that this is Fantasy and not real life.  What would you do if you couldn't defeat an alien race with out using the youth of the world to fight them??
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I ordered this soundtrack so that I can dance/exercise to.  I liked the movie and the music.  It is fun music and gets you moving!  If you liked the movie, I would reccommend it.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Have never seen the broadway musical but I enjoyed the movie.  The songs were great and Tom Cruise was perfect in the role of the aging rocker. Am not a big fan of Tom Cruise but he has made some good movies and he certainly showed his diversity in this one!!  Even if you are not from the 80's and can overlook some of the more raunchy scenes the movie can be a fun watch.
B003A8FESM|1.0|The movie was deffective and would not play at all..So sad because it was a gift for my father ...
B000UFUXC0|5.0|Fun CD with the ride version of Pirates on it, yet some of it is a little silly with the animals singing the pirates song...Although I only listen to the ride song, it is worth it.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put it down.  Highs and lows, but mainly highs. Captivating and suspenseful. Definitely not the ending I expected.
1401200923|5.0|It got a little complicated but it was a great story, i liked how it tied everybody in and the art was great. The only thing I didnt get too much was why the villian hated batman so much, is tells you the whole story but I think it isnt enough motivation to spend your whole life after someone.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|By far the best app I downloaded I wish there were 10 stars to like it I recommend this app to college students and for business use great way to store information

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it was a very good book about romance and I wish I could read more about what happened after that night, if she got pregnant, if she had the baby already and if they are still together. I loved this book and I am glad I read it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is soooooo much fun!!! I have been playing it soooooo much!!!! ,  please get this app, you will love it
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is so amazing, Rick Riodan just keeps coming back with more ideas to keep his readers sucked into the series. I just know that when the house of Hades comes out it will be even better then all the last books put together. So praises for the mark of Athena
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works like a caculator. What else is there to say.<br />It should have been included with the tablet when purchased
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely love this book! It was amazing, the plot of the story was just unbelievable!! I recommend this book to all females, teens and up!
B003L77GRO|5.0|I was very pleased with my purchase from Amazon of Dexter the Fifth Season. It was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, it came quickly with no issues. Thanks Amazon!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It's really fun, but you have to work pretty hard to further yourself in this game. I also cannot log into gameloft in this game in order to invite friends.
0399160450|3.0|I don't know why I keep buying Clancy's books.  I guess I was spoiled by the  first two which were absolutely awesome.  Unfortunately it has been pretty much downhill from there.  This one was no better or worse than the last half dozen.  I consider these \\"money books\\" which an author pumps out to live off his great early books as long as he can.  I suspect that Clancy lends his name and Greaney does most of the writing.  This was a book to pass the time lying on the beach or on an airplane where you don't have to think to much.  The plots are thin and often almost ridicilous and always end up the same way.  Bad guys look invincible, goods guys are struggling, bad guys are blown to hell.  I can see the plot for the next book already,  John Clark takes over for the dead Sam Granger, Melanie comes back from making up with Dad and takes a job with \\"The Campus\\".  Bad guys, maybe Iranians with nuclear bombs, threaten the world, Dom, Caruso, Jack Jr. and Melanie save the world.  So I will probably buy it anyway.  But if you want a really great spy/espionage series,  forget Clancy, Vince Flynn and Brad Thor, read  Alex Berenson or Daniel Silva or better yet Alan Furst who may be the best contemporary writer in this genre.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I loved this book because I just kept wanting to read more and more.<br />It was so cool. I love it! The movie is cool too. The book had some kind of magical force that tempted me to read it.<br />The trunchbull is hilarious and scary<br />Matilda is kind and smart<br />Miss honey is understanding and loving<br />Lavender is courageous and cool<br />Mrs. Wormwood is nicer than Mr wormwood<br />Mr wormwood is really mean.<br />I was laughing out loud when the newt hopped into the glass.<br />It's really sad that miss honey was poor.<br />My favorite character is Matilda because if you just talked a conversation about anything other than mathematics or school she would seem like an average four year old.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to navigate big font easy to read without my glasses loads quickly easy to start over like the winning deal option too
B001DJ7PQ4|1.0|There are obvious & blatant misspellings on the dvds.  While so far the disks play ok, but I am disappointed that I have defective disks.  I checked the disk size and while there are several episodes on each disk, the size seems to indicate a bootleg.
B001E6X4W0|4.0|There is no &#34;down time&#34; in this one! The characters drive the mood and suspence...  and not the gore and violence.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Enjoyed the novel plot and storyline in general.  Although slow at times, had a good balance of action and drama.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|Most likely you'll like this book. I'm NOT into sad story or this kind. This one you'll have to make up your on mine. My grandson in college recommend it to me.  And He's deep at times. About her life and how she aquired books in war in Germany.  Take a chance.  He said it's GOOD.  Sad story
B009K0OL06|4.0|Season two seems to be moving in a different direction than Season one. Missions from the Japanese guy and all. The whole pretext of the show was to do in the Grayson's for what they did to here father, yet with Season two almost over she has done nothing to hurt the Grayson's. The only people she has hurt are Amanda, Jack, and Nolan, her friends.
B005IQZB14|5.0|My husband and I loved this book. I'd compare it to Bill Bryson's story about the Appalachian Trail. This was funny, sad, challenging, exciting, and interesting all the way through.
098555780X|5.0|Very informative, great illustrations, and great variety of projects.  Pictures are very clear and high quality.  I would highly recommend this book for every paracorder's library!
0451232852|2.0|I read on recommendation of a history-loving friend. My husband had already bought it for the Kindle. It opened brilliantly, and the first chapter was a gripping account about life in a Welsh mine. It quickly declined after that, and it was clear the author has never had sex with a woman (or all the women with whom he has had sex have been FAKING IT). I felt like I was reading a cheap romance novel. The history dragged and I had to force myself to finish it. I will not read the other books in the series.
0920668372|5.0|This book is like an old family friend.  I read it to my children and to my grandchildren.  Each generation has taken it to heart.
B009PMB3CI|4.0|Haven't played yet but I'm sure it deserves five stars. Rating four because of the loooooong download time. Enjoy!! Btw, the other games r terrible, like 3d pet rescue. Ugh!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A Great Video for my kids.  It was very informative and a history lesson.  I would highly recommend it to my friends.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book! I highly recommend reading it! A little on the lovey dovey side, but a page turner for sure.
B009MO5960|1.0|Could not wait to get this on 3D version. Pretty much ended Christmas to ensure that I made time to view in both 2D and 3D because I really enjoyed the entertainment value from the previous movies.<br /><br />This was a real disappointment.<br /><br />No story, no development, just rehashing from prior movies and some tossed in fighting sequences.<br /><br />One of the few times that I paid nearly full price for a blu ray when originally released, and hopefully my regret will save someone else this disappointment. My advice is to wait for this thing to fall to bargain basement prices if you feel the need to purchase. Then you will not feel the rip-off effect that the rest of us are having.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|If you're a senior citizen, about to become one, or just want to watch great actors in an exotic location, you'll enjoy this movie.
B008220D5K|4.0|Apatow characters might look like us but they are way funnier and so they deal with their problems with humor. Even when they are mad and/or frustrated (which is much of the time in THIS IS 40) they are funny. In fact, the more they vent the funnier they become to us and to each other. Thus, in Apatow's world, mid-life crisis never really feels like a threat to marriage, rather it feels like a stimulus package (that awakens each to the comedic potential of their shared and respective life situations).<br /><br />Now to the particulars: Paul Rudd is the mellowest charmer in mainstream comedy today while Leslie Mann is mainstream comedy's most hyperactive and unpredictable force. Paul is like a comfortable overstuffed chair that makes you smile when you sit in it and Leslie is like an overly-caffeinated (or under-medicated) transformer who never sits still and never stops talking as she relentlessly fleshes out everyone's (especially her own) insecurities. Put these two opposites together and you are bound to have multiple conflicts per second. And thats exactly what you get in THIS IS 40.<br /><br />In THIS IS 40 Rudd plays \\"Pete,\\" a guy who wants to spend his life sitting on a stool in a small club listening to his favorite indie bands/singers (Graham Parker and the Rumor, Ryan Adams), and Leslie Mann plays \\"Debbie,\\" a trendy shopowner whose sole mission in life is to fight the kind of nostalgia-infused stasis that Rudd so charmingly seeks. It will come as no surprise that these two are at each other the entire film. It doesn't help things one bit that Pete left a lucrative post at SONY in order to pursue his dream job and that the dream job (owning an indie record label) means a greatly reduced paycheck and the possible loss of the family's dream home. But for Debbie the material woes are less threatening to her sense of self than Pete's waning sexual interest and a general loss of passion in their relationship/lives. This film offers keen insight into what married people fight about (little things about the other that remind you of your own imperfections that you dwell on in order to avoid dealing with your own imperfections), and the many fight scenes ring 100% true. Unfortunately, the film never really explores any of the issues it fleshes out in any detail. For instance, Debbie does notice Pete's interest in her sexy and firm young employee (Megan Fox) at a time when she is not feeling particularly attractive/desirable to her husband, but she never feels threatened or jealous and this just doesn't ring true. Instead of dealing with the issue in a comedic but truthful way, Apatow just evades the issue altogether by turning each thing into light comedy (the single guys flirt with her, the married guys just stare from a distance and their wives joke about it). This makes the film infinitely watchable, but, for me the film loses some of its credibility here, and it loses more credibility when Debbie and Pete make peace with each other not because they've re-ignited their passion for each other but because they must re-unite to fight a common enemy. As funny as these scenes are (\\"you look like Tom Petty, and I don't mean that in a good way\\"), they just don't ring true. In fact, these scenes just feel like set-ups for some extended improv. So although you're laughing out loud, you are also kind of disappointed that Apatow took this short-cut to get this couple on the same side again. Also what this short-cut does is convey the message that its shared responsibility (for the family unit) that keeps people together not shared passion. This is a fine message and the ending of the film solidifies this message, but is \\"shared responsibility\\" enough to keep Pete and Debbie together? Apatow cleverly leaves this couples primary internal and external conflicts/questions unresolved: Do they really still love each other? Are they only together out of habit and shared responsibility? Are they ok with the status quo they've stablished? Do they need something more? (So theres plenty of room for sequels). I suppose you could argue that in real life we don't really resolve our conflicts, we just learn to live with them. But at the end of THIS IS 40 all we really have is a long list of divisive issues/uncertainties and a temporary peace (in a bar where a singer sings a song they both like about the inevitable changes that life brings) but no real indication that Pete and Debbie have made any real breakthroughs that will allow them to survive this mid-life crisis. It's a very generic laughter-(and music)-will-cure-all comic ending. We know these characters well enough to know the peace will only last as long as the song (a song that expresses their shared pangs of growing older). But maybe that's all that couples need (or can hope for): a momentary peace to regroup and recall what it is that brought them together in the first place.<br /><br />The rating: For being dead-on accurate as to what people fight about and how they fight, I give the film 5 stars.<br />For the time spent exploring those issues and how people deal with them, I give the film 3 stars.<br />So 4 is the average of those two scores.hey need something more?

B0062NAX1U|5.0|We had movie night at church and everyone was moved by this movie. Great cast and acting. Really sends a powerful statement.<br />h. davis
B00002SSKI|5.0|I absolutley love this movie. It is so sweet and comedic at the same time. This movie totally brings me back to my summer vactions as a kid. I would highly reccommend seeing this movie. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will most definatley warm your heart.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|Lang Lang continues to bring so much wonderful music to life again with his superb talent and interpretations. This is a beautiful recording that highlights the musical genius of both Chopin and Lang Lang.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's not flawless, but it gets so much right, I don't care!  Like Tim Minear said at the 10th Anniversary Firefly Reunion, the creators were right, they had the right ideas, the right crew, performers, writers, directors, everything, except Fox's executives, who must be thanked for throwing money at what they never understood long enough for Joss Whedon, et al, to get these made, and of course, Serenity, the unprecedented film made after a cancelled and single short-seasoned show.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Despite the title of this book, this books fills you with hope. I makes you question life and existence. I'm sure we do this all the time but this book discretely pushes it to the forefront despite the drama in the book, which I may add was well put together and perfect. I will make my little sister read it. It's the perfect fiction with a lot of dose of reality.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read. Once I started reading it , I  couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the next book in this series!
B009GESJH2|5.0|Love it! Great music, exceeded expectations! Kid Rock has really evolved in his music. The meaning to each song is so clear. There are a couple of surprises, keeping Kid true to his roots.
0385535147|3.0|I think the part that bothered me the most was the inconsistency in the story. Sometimes the main character couldn't make a move without the FBI knowing exactly what he was doing yet he was able to set up all of these fraudulent things and they had no idea. Yeah, right. Learning the truth wasn't nearly as thrilling as I'd hoped it would be while other things were easy to figure out. As other reviewers have said, it doesn't seem like a John Grisham book.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is so f@/@ing funny. Its really original movie no other out there like it. Enjoy this movie,\\" I no u will\\" :-D
B0041KKYEM|5.0|i can not express how good this movie if you ever have a interest in ballet kinda of the dark side of it but its awesome full of drama if u like that sort of thing
B003VR5PPY|4.0|This game works really well, it's just really really hard so I put it down for a few weeks. A true room escape game.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Loved this game and all games made by Gameloft the reason I gave this game 4star is cause its very buggy and glichy but other than that its epic game
0688014291|5.0|A great book for those who are taking on a managerial role or for anyone who is wanting to become more effective managers.
0545265355|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to like these books, but once I started I couldn't stop. The price was right and the shipping was fast and reasonable. I like that. Thanks!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My husband and son went to the theater to see this and they really enjoyed it so we bought it to have at home as well.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a story of a man and woman that end up married after he decides that she would work in his idea of a convenience marriage.  Little does he know, things did not work out the way that he planned it.<br /><br />I read the book in three nights.  It is a short read.<br /><br />I would recommend it to a friend.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|The Heroes was a good book, but not as good as his previous 4... Red Country is a return to the magic that Best Served Cold had... The return of one of the greatest characters in modern literature helps a lot as well. I guarantee the Bloody Nine will not disappoint.. His return is everything all First Law fans could hope for...
B00A757EFW|5.0|Love the game but it is kind of to hard. If the creators of the games are reading this then plz make it a tad bit easier.
B008HSJVCK|3.0|As of late the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen has been seeming more and more aimless. After beginning strong and building a great set of characters, only to tear that team down and build up a great, mostly new group in the next book the survivors seem worn out and faded. Most everything that made the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen unique has been eliminated. True, everything is still based around cultural references as before, only now we are getting references to 'Harry Potter' and 'Burn Notice' instead of Jekyll & Hyde and Captain Nemo.<br /><br />The story is what truly seems lacking, it seems as though Alan Moore is going through the motions without creating the interesting plot twists that usually characterize his work. We know the villain is coming throughout the book and then, just in time, he arrives, just as the surviving members of the team have reconciled to battle him. There are no surprises and no substantial character development. The characters just come together and inertia takes over. Apparently there will be more LoEG, if it shows up I hope it takes a more inventive turn.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Funny movie.  Loved all of the normal weird alien beings.  Josh Brolin playing the young 'K' was great!  Will Smith is awesome
B009FZFONO|5.0|There is no zombie television series with which to compare the show, however, in the genre of post-apocalyptic shows in general, the Walking Dead is the best-in-class. Since men often spend a certain percentage of their lives meditating on survival of such encounters (dealing with intruders, survival on a deserted island, level 4 zombie infestation), the show satisfyingly portrays intelligent protagonists who overcome the sheer numbers and force of the zombie herds aptly and reminiscent of the best survivalist daydreams.  With such a mindless juggernaut antagonist, zombies as a genre threatens to produce either uncontrollable situations outside of human control or force-based solutions.  Instead, this show explores the nuances of living in an undead world and a variety of choices made by a rotating cast of characters who have to make difficult choices regarding both the living and the dead resulting in anti-heroes whose slight differences from other vigilantes make them sympathetic to the audience.
B00ARAOBKS|1.0|Do not waste your time watching this film. Terrible! Avoid at all costs.  Should be listed with porn films.<br /> Nothing good to say about it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|bloon tower defence is a great tower defence series that just keeps getting better, especially on mobile as there is less lag, btd5 improves on the few problems of btd4 and gives us more, defenally worth 3. ucks
B005UBNKWO|4.0|I purchased the FX-6100 as part of my desktop upgrade. I needed speed at an affordable price so this chip was a fit for me. I use my PC for video editing, picture editing, browsing online, and streaming movies. For gaming, the CPU is only mediocre; this CPU will not perform nearly as well as the Intel i5's like the i5-2500 quad cores. Also, the FX-6100 CPU is power hungry, rated at 95 watts, which will heat up a small office fast. On the other hand, in pricing, the AMD FX wins compared to the Intel's i5 CPUs.<br />Most PC games use just 2 cores and rarely 4 cores. Games today do not take advantage of the multiple cores in some chips, especially 6 or 8 cores which are underutilized during gaming.  AMD APUs like the A8 and the newer A10 will be a better choice for gaming due to its advanced CPU and GPU combination on one chip die (an A8 APU alone will allow the PC to play games that require DirectX 11, currently the latest revision for the gaming market). The AMD APUs are also more energy efficient and better on the budget because purchasing a video card is not required (a Crossfire video card can be added later to complement the AMD APU). My next upgrade will be from an AMD FX CPU to the AMD APU socket FM2 or better.<br />I am still impressed with the FX-6100 because it allowed me to install Windows 8 Pro and the free Windows Media Pack in under 20 minutes. A fast processor and a SSD like the Crucial 128 6GB/s solid state drive is essential for improving speed of installs and PC cold starts. My FX-6100's CPU Windows Experience Index (WEI) is 7.4., and the Crucial 128GB Sata3 WEI is 7.7 out of 9.9 max.
B0011UF792|5.0|You like Kevin smith? This is a great movie. Just don't take it to seriously. Remember its just a movie. Also remember don't take life to seriously, you will never make it out alive...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved all of the action in this book!  It always kept me on my toes, wanting more!  Amazing book!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I chose it be because I like to draw and if you make a mistake you can erase it and re-draw.  The Drawing Pad gives you lots of options including coloring or painting.  You can save your work in an album and go back to them later.  Really fun to use!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Since May I have read 47 novels.  (And to think... I used to hate to read!). This novel exceed any thoughts or expectations that I might have had before I read it!  I read it in less than 24 hours.  I loved how everything within this novel was real... Sky, Hope, Holder, Karen, and Les.  There were times where I was laughing, smiling like a goofy teenager, and crying at what happens in our lives- past and present.  I love how our past effects our future, but we have to embrace it and move forward.  I have read Slammed and Point of Retreat as well.... And There are def. in the top 15 of my 47 books, but this is #1.  I honestly want to read it again as soon as I finish this review!!
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett has created a masterpiece in this work which covers the rise of fascism and communism in the period leading up to and including World War II.  His characters are some of the same from his previous work which dealt with the period of World War I.  Some characters represent the second generation of those families.  He has woven an amazing story which has encapsulated the various philosophies and people who were part of the history of the &#34;Greatest Generation.&#34;
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Just hope the coins come faster the longer I play this game. It is like at the fair and I find myself holding my breath.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I was a bit confused trying to follow the story line as it didn't coincide with the original. Great special effects and the acting was very good.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Brought this out at a party for my kids, and it was a HIT!  The kids all loved it!  Recommended for kids!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really had an easy time getting into this book. I felt like I was following Katie 's every move and getting anxious over Kevin. It really kept me glued for more.
0783240287|5.0|Our family really likes this movie.  We all love the upbeat and &#34;catchy&#34; music.  I catch everyone singing along lol!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|best app ever...this is the first ap i had no problem buying it even though the free version was great...thank you for this alar
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I wasn't sure that I wanted this book because I felt that I already had a great handle on the exposure triangle. I've been into photography (5 years) and shooting in Manual (1 year). Once I started reading the book I was wowed by the fact that there was so much more to know. I have read this book once and it has really improved my photos. I plan on reading it again.<br />Highly, Highly recommend!<br />A++++++

B004KKX80A|5.0|My son could not wait to receive his toy. He is very pleased with this product and seems to be holding up well.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Can't get enough of the gang and season 5 did not disappoint.  The continued roll of the &#34;love interests&#34; really adds to the comedy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well, she's done it again!! I read both Slammed and Point of Retreat in less than a week and was riveted from page one of both. The same thing has happened with Hopeless. The characters just drew me in from the start. All of them. I felt a connection with each one. I never wanted this book to end and can't wait for her next book! She is amazing! Thank you again Collee Hoover!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great quality video. Easy to access. Watched on iPhone and iPad. This show is my favorite! Can't wait until the rest of the season begins again!
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a great hidden object game for both adults and teens.  if you learn the rules if the game, and figure out how much energy to expend, you can play it without having to use any real money to play it which us definitely a plus!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great deal! I bought a few of these for Christmas gifts. They arrived quickly and were a great value for a small children's gift.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|Just read this if you're a fan. It doesn't disappoint. Couldn't put it the book down. Glad to own it.
B00866JL96|5.0|Great deal! This was a great value and shipped fast. I recommend this good movie. Very satisfied with this purchase.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I devoured the first several Scarpetta books years ago, enjoying both the storyline and the writing.  Now, the writing is surprisingly lackluster and the storyline less than compelling.  I was disappointed.
B005XLN97M|4.0|My daughters received this for their birthday in early December and were so excited.  They had been wanting a house for their Barbies for a very long time but most of them are so expensive so this was a nice alternative.  It did take me a while to set up and the girls to put stickers on things, but they love that they can change things up and use the back as a play area too and they finally have a house that their Barbie dolls actually fit in.  I might suggest taking it out of the package and getting it all set up before giving it, if it will be a gift, since my daughters were so eager to start playing with it, but had to wait for all of the pieces (and I mean ALL) of the pieces to get put in place.  That being said I think it's a great alternative to the expensive Barbie houses and my daughters have had a great time playing with it ever since, even after getting other Barbie items for Christmas.
B001HPP2X2|4.0|I had heard a lot about the TV show called Dexter, but had never watched it.  I spent basically an entire day watching Season 1 because I became so immediately interested.  The show is cleverly done and even though the main character is a killer, the character is funny and endearing.  There are a couple of actors who aren't that great, which is the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes suspense.
0143119680|1.0|I bought this at Target.  It seemed like an interesting story, but I couldn't finish reading it because it was so badly written.  I have no clue how it managed to get such high reviews.  The book actually sucked.  I fell asleep several times while trying to read it.  The main character is too perfect and boring.  Mathew Clairmont is not much better.  It seems to go and on and on describing boring things like what she eats, how she exercises, exactly what exercises she does, her doing yoga, her drinking tea, her making toast, going to yoga again or worse, her waiting for Mathew.  The book sucks...  Save your money.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|The movie was quite good, great acting and graphics. Unfortunately my family kept interrupting the movie all the way through, will have to see again soon!
0061122416|5.0|I bought as a gift because I loved this book so much. It takes you on a adventurous journey filled with fantasy and morals. Learned valuable lessons here. Highly recommend reading.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|game is really fun.  however it freezes up when i lose and do not have a high score.  also would be nice if you could switch out a ball color once in a while.  i use this on my kindle fire hd 8&quot; and paid for the game.
0802473156|5.0|This book truly changed my life. It is a must read and you can apply these five love languages to all relationships. It has helped me view love in different avenues and how to adjust the way I love to meet others.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have fallen in love with this show. It is very entertaining and the actors are very talented. Cant wait for the 3rd season.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it works like my android app....maybe a bit faster. recommended product . I like the sincing ability. I use my kindle for everything now. it's smarter than my smart phone
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was , a really good book and I recommend it for anyone who likes action and adventure! SUSANNE COLLINS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A thought provoking book that shows how multidimensional a marriage can be.  Very entertaining, couldn't put it down, will recommend to many friends.
B0099G3I96|4.0|No Doubt is back!!! :)  It's a perfect mix of No Doubt's signature sound with a splash of new elements. Love it!
B00APUQPX6|4.0|this is a good movie that is great for the family. it's funny and very entertaining. i hope you like it too.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My parents purchased this for my nephew and he loves it.  It is one of his most favorite movies.  Thank you.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie was just soo incredible I wanted to buy it to try and capture things I missed the first time.<br />LOVE how amazon gives you a digital copy to watch online with your DVD purchase!! :)
B00942S4OY|5.0|Our daughter received this for Christmas.  She loves One Direction and was so excited to receive this as a gift.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This is MY favorite movie that came out that year. If you havn't seen the movie yet this is a movie you gotta watch. filled with unexpected twist and turns.
0385536828|3.0|I liked Atonement better!  Serena seemed like an immature teenager and I tired of her affaires.  The plot had some interesting twists but the protagonist spoiled it for me.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Love this movie it's one of my favorites this year. The acting is SOOOO good and the atmosphere is believable.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It's a Good page turner, mostly a romance and chick lit book but  if you enjoy those kind of books I definitely recommend it.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Unlike the book that drag on. This movie is more entertaining and much better graphics then the first two of this saga.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I read this book in one night, four short hours. Ellen has this way of making people happy, whether it be through her talk show, her books, or her facebook and Twitter posts. Supposedly, her audience is the adult female, but I am a young teenager, and I will forever smile and laugh because of her. This book truly makes people happy, inside and out. I laughed and smiled through this whole book, and I feel so lucky to be able to have such an amazing and strong woman to look up to. This book teaches you important lessons, and has you laughing during the whole thing. If you enjoy this book half as much as I did, it will still be the best book ever.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I've been watching this show sense season 2 but i own ALL the seasons. this show is one of the best to watch from season 1 all the way to this one. you see such a change in the characters development. ENJOY
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great present or movie to sit down with someone and enjoy.  Also for those awkward family's moments pop this in and everyone is sure to get a laugh during the holidays.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|this is probably my FAVORITE season from the series so far. it keeps you on the edge and has some fun graphics
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's the Weather When I need to know, it's there. it. does the job well,  What more can i say.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I love this movie and just had to own, was so glad that it comes with the ultraviolet copy. And VERY happy that it came in very quick time!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game!!  And we young-old folks need things that will keep our minds active and alert. I will keep being challenged.  Thank you.  The sound effects are also entertaining.  Mona_o2lady
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Love this movie. i bought it for my brothers birthday gift, but we all ended up falling in love with well scripted tale.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The Brits have figured out this acting mystery.  All of the acting is superb, from top to bottom.  And the varied plots keep the story very interesting.  I cannot pick a favorite character, they are all so well done.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite from the series. It explains alot about the X-men and has great graphics and acting. very pleased with this purchase :)
B009YX02T8|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!!!!  I am listening to it as I write this review. I own all the movie soundtracks and this is my absolute favorite!!!  Great songs were really picked for this one. I love them all!  Love it! Love it! Love it!
B0002I831S|5.0|I could not believe the price i got for this, and it was definitly worth the purchase. i gave it to my boyfriend for our one year and he loved it. we started a marathon and continue to watch it together.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|This cover looks nice and elegant but it is in the way. When it opens up so you can read it, it either hangs over on the right side or the left causing it to be awkward to hold and my hands are small so it gets uncomfortable after just a few pages of reading. When I first opened it and started using it, it was crisp and stiff and would hold the Fire up, but now it is flimsy and falls down more than not. The credit card holders are basically useless as when you put them in, you can't really close the cover because the magnets don't touch anymore and the edge of the cards is right against the screen which I don't like either. The only reason I haven't cut the front cover off is because I like to have the screen covered when I am not using it. I'll be searching for something else in the near future.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|The game isn't too bad but there are some kinks. Not a lot of songs to choose from on the free version and when having to press more than 2 keys, the sensors are off.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is addictive and fun to play. It is a bit sensitive and cards can get placed where you didn't plan to place them adding an extra move to your game.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Enjoy Kate Morton's books. Read the Secret Garden first and then tried this one because it was by the same author. every bit as good!<br /><br />nice style of writing. Good story lines and a good read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Amazingly accurate portrayal of the life of seals. Live by am ethos greater then you<br />Expect nothing in return .
B00A77II0U|5.0|What can I say about this game that is enough praise?!?!? Graphics and story line are great!!!  Will buy more games for sure! Played expert
B009ERK1T0|4.0|When I first heard this album, I was slightly disappointed. It's different from Diamond Eyes, which I thought had been a huge return to form. But now, after listening a few more times, I can honestly say I love this album. There are moments that simply transcend...if you are a Deftones fan, buy it. If you aren't, well, I'd listen to a few tracks on youtube and see what you think. Me, I'm very happy with it. Thanks, guys, for another great album.  Update: June 23rd, 2016 Haven't listened to it in a while but Leathers, Tempest and Rosemary continue to fascinate. There are other intriguing cuts on the album as well. This is not an instabuy by any means, except for ardent fans of course...but yes, I would rebuy this if I had to. :)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I saw the TV series first so had to get the book.  I love it more than the TV version, which  also love. Very well written, interesting characters and great storyline.
B00005AXKF|2.0|dvd would not play on any of the dvd players in the house. when i change my region on my computer to germany it play on my computer only, but my family doesn't watch movies on the computer so this dvd is useless.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love this continuation of the series. the characters are well developed and and the story continues to hold my interest.
B00785P2QC|3.0|only on level 8<br />too many goals require payment<br />so far just ok<br />will post another review when I get further along
B000FCKGPC|3.0|i really loved this series in the first 3 book.  But this one seems to drag on and wander, and still more characters are introduced, making it harder to keep track of everyone.  I'm 2/3s of the way thru it and and still no mention of Tyrion or the dragon princess, 2 of the most interesting characters.  Seems like the author has lost his way in this labyrinth he's created.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|The creative writing on this second season is just as good as the first.  Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the dynamic duo!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love this second book as much as the first one.  Characters are interesting and unexpected turns in the story keep you coming back for more.
B003274QH6|5.0|Breaking Bad's dark comedic drama is well-written and features the great acting performances of Bryan Cranston, who deserves all the accolades from this smash hit!
B005IULERU|5.0|This book deserves more than 5 stars.  Seriously, I was laughing so hard my stomach actually started hurting and I had to put it down!  I am the type of person that finds more humor in things that were not meant to be funny, like a misspelled or autocorrected text message, especially when it is completely inappropriate, and less humor in someone that is actually trying to be funny.  That is why I love this book.  After a very brief introduction, the hilarious texts are laid out in \\"chapters\\" according to the content and/or relationship between texter and textee:<br /><br />1) Parents Just Don't Understand (Awkward Texts with Mom & Dad)<br />2) Love Gone Wrong (When Couples Text)<br />3) What's Cookin (Autocorrected Food & Beverage Texts)<br />4) Freudian Slips (When Autocorrect Reads Your Mind)<br />5) Say What?! (Totally Random Autocorrect Incidents)<br />6) Textin' 9 to 5 (Autocorrected on the Clock)<br />7) With Friends Like These (When Friends Let Friends Get Autocorrected)<br /><br />From \\"Love Gone Wrong\\":<br /><br />>>We have 7pm reservations, where the heck are you?!<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Sorry... Running a few minutes late!  I'll be lesbian in five mins, I swear.<br /><br />>>You're a lesbian now?  I wish you told me that before we got married. :)<br /><br />Or this one, from a daughter to her mother:<br /><br />>>Did you leave a s*** on my bed last night?  Thanks...it's great! :)<br />>>Oh my goodness...that was supposed to say shirt!  Whoops!<br /><br />Honestly, these aren't even the funniest ones, I would rather save those for you to read in the book.  There is a website also under the same name (damnyouautocorrect) and if you find even one of those funny, you will love the book.  One disclaimer is that this book is in no way PG or family friendly, it is full of adult language so keep the children away from it.  The only way they could have improved this book would be to make it larger and longer, maybe like the larger \\"coffee table\\" books.  I definitely recommend buying this!
B000F8O35U|1.0|I received the DVD and the cover was in good shape.. But when I put it in to watch, it played half way through the movie and quit. It does not work at all now.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Had been an avid Sparks reader but lately I felt like I had outgrown this author and was tired of the predictability of his writing. On a whim, I decided to read Safe Haven and was pleasantly surprised when reading. The storyline of this book had a uniqueness to it that differed from other books of his that I've read but also held true to some common themes seen in Sparks books that his readers look to see.
B0086700CM|5.0|because i like it and i wish everybody can have it intretains alot and i can share with my brother
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love this game, but it IS addictive!  Sure, it helps if you buy stuff with cash, but the price is very reasonable.  I don't mind paying to play sometimes, either, because I love to support great games like this.
0785163174|5.0|For any Marvel fan out there, this hardcover collection should be on your shelf. 500+ pages of awesome artwork and a suberbly written story. Don't pass up the chance to pick this book up right now.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Enjoyed it so much I bought the full version, which I rarely do. The key pencil is a little tedious, though.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Had a hard time getting through this book.  Just didn't keep my attention like the first two.  Ending was ok.
159420411X|4.0|During these times of dubious economic and political stability, the buzz word &#34;uncertainty&#34;  is often heard in the media and felt in our personal lives.  When hearing of the success in which Mr. Silver predicted the outcome of the 2012 election, I became curious as to how he was able to so closely call precinct results and bought this book.<br /><br />  Not being a gambler per se, and knowing very little about statistics, I was a bit apprehensive at first; but soon comforted by the straight-forwardness in the text, and how conversational it read. Also, I could see why it was listed among self-help books, and like how broadly the concept of finding our personal signals (reliably factual), amid ambiguous noise, could be applied.<br /><br />  The author's analyses among various topics reveal a plethora of knowledge and wide range of experiences that serve as examples of how to think in specific ways in given situations. His gift for conveying what went wrong and why makes the book intriguing and fun to read. Far from the tone of a condescending know-it-all, Nate Silver writes as a buddy who is willing to show you the ropes in sports, investments, medicine, weather, etc. In short, he offers you a key to reliability.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think that this dictionary is helpful when your reading and you don't know a word you can real quick look it up and then you know the meanings of words so you will understand the book a lot more and the book will be more enjoyable.
B008602KQI|1.0|The movie was boring and for it to be 2 and a half hours long, there could've been more details from the book to incorporate in the story line....everything happened so fast that it seemed to leave out the descriptives of why the different scenes were actually taking place.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It's pretty cool I guess but just for you to know Greg dies in the end so the series has ended with this book
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The book kept me on edge with characters coming together like never imagined. I loved every second of it. Anyone wanting to get lost in a book can do just that in The Lucky One.
B0064W639K|5.0|Amazing artwork and a thrilling story. Very hard to put down! Makes me want to read all the Bat Man comics right away!
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|George Clooney does a wonderful job ... casting terrific ... excellent movie. Shared this movie with other family members who also enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very captivating. I can't wait to read the next one and see how the storyline continues. Very easy too read as well.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Had never viewed a West Wing program when on the air but friends had told us it was very good so we bought the collection. We love it. We are now into the third season and we have to drag ourselves away. We, of course, wonder how much of it is true and how much fiction ... it's very interesting and entertaining. We recommend this collection to any and all who have an interest in politics.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is simply amazing! I will probably read it over and over again. Anyone who could grasp the meaning should love this particular book. Maybe rated for teen to adult for some violent content
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In a matter of hours, I devoured this book. So much action and suspense; I couldn't stop reading! I can't wait to read the next book!
1400067820|4.0|I suspect this is a 5 star book; the missing star represents my difficulty with parts of it. I loved and comprehended perfectly the parts when Taleb writes as himself, and connects his own experience to his ideas. He can be exceptionally clear and entertaining and delightfully cranky. Then, in the next paragraph, I'm in a thicket of foggy abstract language. Does anyone write philosophy clearly?<br />To be perfectly fair, as a reader of this author's material, I may only be worth 3 stars. He obviously knows everything and everyone, and unfortunately, I don't. Still, I wish a good editor had pruned it a bit. If it were 1/3 shorter, the content would have been clearer and more potent. More people would pick it up, read it, and finish it, and maybe our world would become more anti-fragile. So: it's a good book, thought provoking, funny, possibly mind-blowing, and still on the coffee table where I pick it up, read a page or two, then put it down and think about it.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for hubby.  Blu-ray/DVD combo was a great deal on Cyber Monday!  Enjoyed the extras about the stunts after the movie too.  Fast Fun!!!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|For a FREE arcade flight sim, this one is quite good. I've been looking for one like this. Lots of nicely modeled aircraft to unlock,free roam (not on rails like old Afterburner games), easy controls, great frame rates even on the first gen Kindle Fire, good sound effects. Best of all, the Amazon version is fun and free of obtrusive, annoying ads (at least on my Kindle Fire). You heard correctly, as of the writing date of this review, this game on my Kindle Fire surprisingly does NOT have ads (Update: The version I tested from the Google Play store DOES have ads in the aircraft selection menu -- which showed up on the Nexus 7). It's a keeper. If it weren't free, I'd gladly pay for a game of this caliber. That's not to say that it doesn't have its drawbacks. It is strictly air-to-air combat so far as I can tell (no bombing runs). I haven't yet encountered any flak or attacks from AA batteries. You fly solo without any wingmen. But these are minor quibbles for an excellent free game.<br /><br />Update: I tried to install this on my phone from Amazon's app store, but it turns out that the Amazon version is a Kindle Tablet version!!! This is not stated in the title. So looks like you have to use the ad version for non-Kindle devices such as phones. Interestingly enough, this Kindle version DOES work on my Nexus 7 after all. It doesn't run as smoothly (occasional stuttering during play and slower transitions between aircraft in the selection menu) as the version in the Play store, but it is ad-free.
B006WXHJTO|5.0|I received the movie right away and best of all the price was amazing! I got a great deal! I definitely would recommend it to everyone.
0061969656|3.0|My husband didn't really like this book but our son thinks it's wonderful.  To much detail on trees, etc for my husband.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game...tap feature makes it easier and more fun..so much easier than dragging...teaches you to think accurate and fast<br />.
B00004TS0E|4.0|Who does'nt believe in Santa Claus? This heart warming movie brings a smile to the young and young at heart
B000JO9JHW|4.0|This totally unique plot is entertaining in a dark humor style. It can not be dismissed as just another cop show. I would recommend it only to mature adults with a twisted sense of humor.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app has a lot more than just the basic functions.  works great to buy and sell items. very user friendly.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|farting, smoking humping... I love it all. I like Family guy and south park 90% of the time. I saw this 3 times in theaters to show my loved ones and bought the Blu-Ray combo pack for the extras and so far I love it! Making of was awesome nd the combo pack lets you install on up to 10 devices!!! watche the mkaing of and all bonus features!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun challanging game. Simple enough to be fun but hard enough to make you think. A friend recominded it and i've been playing it ever since.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The main character in the book, Charlie, has a very interesting life. By writing letters he describes what it's like to be a teenager and the true ups and downs of life.  The book was very good and very well written I highly recommend it.
B0079R8KO0|3.0|Doesn't stand up as well as I thought it would, has a flimsy back, picture makes it look sturdier than it really is, otherwise it is a good cover, just not a good stand.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not something i would let a teen read , but I thought it was  good. Not so much of the sex ,but of the writer . I held every word. I couldn't put it down . Finished it in 6 hrs off in on for 3 days . I've even told a few men to read it.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|My daughters LOVE this app. That was my reason for purchasing and it met my expectations. This was a wonderful purchase for my daughters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I luv this book of romance and tragedy. It is an unforgettable story. Peeta and  Katniss make a great couple... i wish i had peeta.
0316069434|5.0|I have not had a chance to read this yet.  But I know I will love it.  I have read all of his books and have never been dissapointed.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for laugh-out-loud material... I have read all of the dairy of a wimpy kid®<br /> books and Jeff Kinney never fails to bring new, hilarious material... I am not a real reader myself... but there's something about Jeff Kinney's work that intrigues me...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This app is very fun and is very addicting! I have no complaints with this app what-so-ever. I recommend getting this app
B0041KVZ18|2.0|My records were both warped . This is probably due to heat during shipping, I am ordering another in replacement. I had the same problem with my yellow submarine copy but not with revolver
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I started back reading with this book as my first waypoint; and I'm glad I did.  It was longer than I would have wanted for my first book, but it didn't make me quit, only motivated me more.
B009MF56GC|3.0|E 2 was about what I expected.  A few more &#34;old&#34; action heros got some screen time.  Lots of bullets fired with almost &#34;hero&#34; damage.  If you like this type spoof you'll like Expendables 2
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I would say that this is honestly a great book to anyone trying to get some backstory on the Halo universe. If you like halo then I highly recommend you read this.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|What struck me the most during the show was the respect and love shown to Jason, not only by Jones, Plant and Page, but by the audience.  It is obvious the admiration that the guys and the crowd have for him.  I'm not sure if the show would have had the same impact if a different drummer performed.  You could see the confidence and perhaps even some fear in Jason's eyes as he parlayed his late father's ability to carry the songs.  He made this show Magic as much as Jones, Plant and Page.<br />As with any show of this magnitude, you will never be able to satisfy everyone's ultimate set list, or sound quality or even editing ( could certainly do without the grainy bits ).<br />I thought the performance itself was beyond expectations.  True professionals all around.  Musicianship at its best.<br />JPJ is the consummate bass/keyboard player, love the 10 string bass.  Scream like Plant for 40 years, yah, he can still belt out a rock song like nobody's business.  Page swaggers around the stage like a 20 year old kid, try that with a 12 lb. Les Paul on your shoulder for 2 hrs at any age.  I could watch his facial expressions for hours.<br />I quote, &#34; I'm not a guitarist as far as a technician goes, I deal in emotions&#34;.  Love it!!<br />Led Zeppelin were in their element on this day, make no mistake about that.  Thank you Ahmet and Atlantic Records.<br />&#34; What were my expectations for the show?&#34; said Page.  &#34;That if we did it, we did it really well.&#34;<br />I'm not sure who enjoyed this evening more, the fans or the band.<br />You be the judge.  Turn It Up!!!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This was a very interesting and different point of view on history if there was real vampires. Would recommend if you want something different to watch.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Started somewhat slow, but I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. Some old characters were revisited and some new ones were met. In the end it was a solid output from an edgy, seat of your pants fantasy writer.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Intertaining movie, watched it twice since I missed parts the first time around. Would recommend for a good time and laugh.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Love this indie Christmas recording from She & Him. I'm certain it will become a classic! Check it out! The indie / lounge sound will warm up your holidays for sure!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Before I got this, I had heard from a lot of people that I know that \\"King Animal\\" was a letdown. I decided to hear for myself and determine. My conclusion is that \\"King Animal\\" is a great Soundgarden album that might not please the entire fan-base but it still is very well done.<br /><br />\\"King Animal\\" sounds like a mix of \\"Down on The Upside\\", \\"Superunknown\\", and Chris Cornell's solo stuff. The band still rocks hard but it seems like they recognize that they're older and want to explore more territory. There a couple tracks on here that don't come together completely and sound like an attempt at the sound of the early years of the band (\\"Badmotorfinger\\", \\"Louder than Love\\", etc) but there aren't many misfires on here.<br /><br />Chris Cornell's voice is great on here; the only time when it gets to be a little grating personally to me is on the 2nd song. Kim Thayill is still amazing on guitar, Matt Cameron is still amazing on drums; all the band members are impressively capable at their age.<br /><br />For people who are looking for another \\"Badmotorfinger\\" or \\"Louder than Love\\", there's a good chance you'll be let down by this album. On the other hand, people who loved \\"Down on the Upside\\", \\"Superunknown\\", and \\"Euphoria Morning\\" by Chris Cornell will definitely find something to appreciate here.<br /><br />My one major complaint is that the packaging of the CD is extremely irritating. I don't mind a cardboard case but when it's next to impossible to get the CD out without damaging it, it's pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />The Soundgarden albums of the 80's and 90's will never be topped in my mind but there's no denying how good this album is. I highly recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Riveting! Couldn't put the book down. Excited to see what happen in the third book! Great job Suzanne for excellent story telling!
B0056BMK6K|3.0|I purchased this book long before the issue of paid reviews ever came out. And, I don't want to base the review on the fire fight that's currently raging.<br /><br />What I will say, though, is that I felt this book did one thing and one thing very well - - it gave indie authors the inspiration to get out there and fight for their books. Although the author used paid reviews to help market his books, the bottom line is - anyone who is a smart marketer can use white hat techniques (not black) to make a name for themselves and build an audience. Personally, I'm happy that I bought this book because it does go into techniques that I can put into place - beyond that, I'll leave the review argument to others.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|**********CAUTION: This movie is an ADULT COMEDY. It is NOT meant for children or impressionable audiences (i.e preteens, those easily offended, or immature audiences). *************Thus being said, this movie is sheer GENIUS. It is a SATIRE. If you want an autobiographical account of the music/glee/a capella industry, then watch something else. This movie makes no apologies in it's attempt to entertain/parody. There are moments of stupidity and cheesiness but it's all in fun. Before you even contemplate seeing this movie you should realize that yes there are stereotypes, and references to sex, drugs, and alcohol. There are 2 scenes which are frankly very disgusting but if you can stomach all of these things and focus on the actual movie and characters then you will love this movie. Those that have issues with the characters or story should realize that this movie is based on a novel written by Mickey Rapkin called \\"Pitch Perfect\\". He was a journalist whom in fact followed and covered the trials and tribulations of 3 a capella collegiate groups over the course of one year. The characters and events are based on his findings and experiences. If you have a problem with that then watch something else. Personally I consider this movie one of the greatest comedies I've ever seen. Rebel Wilson is extraordinarily funny in this movie. This movie is easily the funniest and best feel good movie of the year. I would even go so far as to say that I would rate as one of the 10 best comedies I have ever seen. First and foremost, if you go into this movie with an open mind, and not expect Shakespearean dialogue, acting. or directing then you will enjoy this movie as well. To reiterate, Rebel Wilson is an absolute joy in this movie. She made me laugh so hard I cried. As an added bonus, the musical arrangements and the singing are both great. I would definitely have seen this movie in the theatre.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This game is ok so far.  I never played the origional, but I got into Final Fantasy around FF5 for the SNES.  I fell in love with FF7, and always loved to play Tactics as wellS, so I have given this game a 5 star rating to further that cause.  Both those games would work so well on the Kindle, so please Square Enix, just do it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book will leave your heart pounding, but gives a perfect ending! Sparks tells a different kind of story with so much raw emotion that makes you appreciate real love.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|Saw the tour live in Atlanta and therefore, it makes sense to re-live it as often as possible!  Truly MAGNIFICENT production!!!
B0067R0APK|5.0|App is awesome and its worth the upgrade. By far this is the best weather app available. I have it on My Droid Razr and my kindle fire HD
B006MW3V6U|5.0|place and timing of this movie is of my interest.  Great leading actors, life of people different cultures and positions in life.  Very entertaining.
B00866H7SS|3.0|You do want to keep reading and see what happens but this hole thing of they are madly in love after one look is OTT, it's pushing it a little to far with the whole story/ relationship happening in just a few weeks where one day they are madly in love and can't live without each other and 2 days later they are jealous and there is always some thing to separate them and cause problems, don't get me wrong it was the same in Fifty shades of Gray and I'm not sure which one came out first ??? but I think the whole Dom/ Sub story line has been wrong dry at this stage. Some times it would be nice if all the characters weren't so beautiful and rich and a bit more realistic.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game keeps the kids busy for about 20 minutes. Nothing spectacular but they aren't the biggest angry birds fans, but its a good go to game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this book was a great read. I just started high school a couple of months ago and this book helped take my mind off all the stress. It helped me feel like I do belong, it made me feel infinite.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 6 & 4 year old love this game. It has two player mode and they both can spazz out chopping fruit together. They get a lot of laughs out of this game, but doesn't hold there attention for much more than 20 minutes, but they are busy bodies.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Bought the Fire for my daughter for Christmas. This was the first game she purchased and loves it. Would recommend.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Good game, is a brain user, which is good if you are going to be sitting playing a game. You have to swing your guy on the end of a rope to avoid obstacles. My 8 yr old really likes his game.
B005BCE7II|5.0|O bougth this movie cuz i wanted to try a 3D movie the movie is good I couldn't get it to work with my system I am still figuring out what is the problem if is the 3D samsung TV , the 3D Samsung DVD, or the actual DVD disk.<br />However, I haven watch the movie yet.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Hellooooooo, great movie! This should be in everyone's home.  Awesome kid and family movie about treasure, adventure and kids grabbing some independence.  What recent movie had this stuff? All I see now is violence, bullying, smart ass disrespectful kids on tv who dress like adults and aren't really kids but mini adults who I'd never like in real life and do not want my kid to emulate.  Enjoy that rant? Well I'm right :)<br />The Goonies is an amazing movie!
0743270754|5.0|Moved a long quickly considering that it was a long book. I was surprised about Lincoln's political manner and how he could outfox others. It almost seemed like he was born for the presidency at that time. I wish it could have covered the 13th amendment in more detail.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|This is a great series and makes the perfect gift.  The product is of great quality and presentation. Glad I ordered.
B0015AARJI|5.0|it was packaged very nicely. there was nothing i did not like about it<br />I came in better than i imagined

B0018J2QB8|5.0|The plot is more intricate in season 2. The character development more interesting as well. Can't wait to watch season 3.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Thus book has lots of great examples of simple successful businesses that didn't require a lot of money to start.
B0001I561E|3.0|Everything was as described but the disc skips one part which is disappinting since it was brand new.<br />Other than that I would have given the review four stars.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I first read this book years ago, and right from then I was blown away by Mitchell's literary vision. Not only is the writing itself magnificent, but the story and message therein are also beautiful.<br /><br />When the movie came out, I saw it three times, loving it each time. Afterwards, I went back and read the book again. It was still magnificent, possibly even more so.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone willing to give it a chance.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Enjoyed story line and principles told through story of Sergeant York.  It is a good educational and family movie. Word
098555780X|5.0|This book is a great for beginners looking beyond the common Cobra Stitch/Solomon Bar. The book offers many ideas including contrasting colors, items other than bracelets (key fob anyone?) but it really shines with multitude of tying techniques.  With variations on the Solomon Bar, the quick to pick up Endless Falls and much more, this book will occupy the knot tie-er in you life for weeks.<br /><br />Fusion Ties was a great confidence booster for me. I began experimenting with ties of my own mix and matching the start and finish of tying techniques.  It's also great for getting others interested in tying.  I took it to a scout camping trip and all the adults wanted to try one technique or another.<br /><br />In short, the book is a winner. Buy this and a couple of reels of paracord in your favorite colors and see what you can make.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|Not much of a piano -- might be great for keeping a child occupied but in my opinion not much good otherwise.
B003PM5Y4M|5.0|This comedy is brilliant!  It seems to get funnier the more I watch it.  It will go down in comedy history as one of the great ones.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I tried everything I could possibly think of to change the programed city to my city and it just would not work! After two days of attempts I finally gave up! What a waste.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow this is an amazing read. The twist and turn of this ha  me on the edge with every page.
B002VECM4A|4.0|A very compelling movie that broaches a subject that is hard and painful...great movie...I love the ending!!! Her mother is quite a piece of work!!!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I can't rate the product itself because Amazon marketplace refuses to deliver the product unless I register a credit card number on my tablet FOR A FREE PRODUCT!!!<br /><br />SCAM!
B000002HO3|4.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all times...love Simply Red!!! His songs are wonderfully unique and his sound is one of a kind!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|we love this game!! my daughter is four ans we both play it.. thus game is great! I highly recommend this game!! it is adorable!
B009CGCQPU|5.0|I found the sound and picture quality to be as good as the original I purchased for the flat screen. I have watched this movie several times but never with the X-ray feature. It gave an added dimension of enjoyment to an already favorite feature.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I loved how cheap this album was. I just saw the movie and it was fabulous so I knew I needed the soundtrack too!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put it down!!  Finished it in three days-great story! A must read - you won't regret it!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is really good . It runs great on my iPhone so far no problems with it just wish they would stop changing stuff I liked the ORIGINAL FACEBOOK the BEST .
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This movie hit home.  So close to my heart where the issue of feeling alone when you are together.  I saw myself and my husband in both of these characters many times through this movie.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone thinking divorce or the other side of the fence is greener!
B007EE4XKI|4.0|A good book.  I enjoyed the first person narrative and the ending left me wondering about book II.  An interesting and enjoyable book.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I would recommond it people who are not appalled by bad language. It was funny but a little on the foolish side.
0385040253|5.0|Bought it for a gift -- husband says it's not only the definitive knot book, but also a history lesson, as it describes how and why certain knots evolved.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Great CD! All the songs are amazing. However, I am not sure if this is an app issue but it wouldn't not play right in Amazon Cloud on my phone... kind of annoying.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|My favorite of the three Christopher Nolan movies. Takes you into the beginnings of Batman and how he becames such a badass. Also, Liam Neeson is fantastiic as well as great performances from Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman and Michael Caine.
B007IQWQ88|5.0|This set is a record collector's dream come true. By that, I mean that if you did collect records back in the day, you'll appreciate the packaging of this extraordinary set, which features all of the orchestral recordings Herbert von Karajan recorded for DG in the 1960s, presented in their original LP configurations, with the LP original cover art AND liner notes (which are well nigh unreadable at the reduced point size necessary to fit them on the back of a CD-sized cover. Those liner notes appear in three languages - one wonders if a better course of action would have been to choose one language and print the notes at a readable size).<br /><br />A nostalgic aura surrounds this set, which may not mean anything to the average listener. It certain makes its effect on me.<br /><br />My very first DG LP purchase back in my HS days was Karajan's 1959 \\"Ein Heldenleben.\\" That LP featured the \\"helmet\\" artwork that graces the current  DG Originals issue CD cover. The cover art in this set features that of \\"Heldenleben's\\"  initial release, which is an image of Karajan conducting that has \\"1950s\\" written all over it. The nostalgia continues for me with the 2 discs that comprise K's recording of Bach's \\"Brandenburg Concertos,\\" as these 2 LPs were two of the LPs I purchased in Berlin back in the summer of 1972, when my HS band went on a tour of Europe to promote the 1972 Olympic Games in M&uuml;nchen (yes, THOSE fatal Olympic Games). I traded off those lps long ago, so reencountering their cover art 40 years after the fact brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />Every CD in this set has been remastered using DG's very successful \\"Original Image Bit Processing,\\" which is the same technique they use for their \\"Originals\\" series. The sound on these CDs is probably the best sound we've ever heard for these recordings - definitely an improvement over the earlier CD reissues on DG Galleria, as well as bettering the sound that was present on the LP issues. DG has now had 20+ years of experience working with their OIBP technology, and its application to every disc in this set is now a tried-and-true upgrade in terms of getting as much as possible out of the original source material.<br /><br />Playing times on these CDs match their LP lengths, which mean some discs are short by CD standards. I was a first a bit annoyed by this, until I realized that such concerns are meaningless when one owns a 5-CD carousel player, as do I. One might gripe that K's 1962 recording of the Beethoven Ninth is spread over 2 CDs in this issue, when it could easily fit on a single CD. But what's the difference if you can simply load the two CDs in your carousel and let them play in sequence?<br /><br />I have only one complaint about this set, and that is in the way it was packaged for shipping by you-know-who, which was in an oversized box with the product sitting flush against one end of the box, with the empty space filled with those airbag thingees. That created a package with all the weight on one end. So when the package was inevitably mishandled in transit - and was dropped at some point along the delivery route - the weighted end of the package is the end that hit the pavement, not the end stuffed with the air-filled bubble wrap, resulting in one corner of the enclosed CD set being slightly crushed. That crushed corner extended into the inner packaging of the product, though none of the CDs were damaged.<br /><br />Why the shipping department didn't center the product in the middle of their shipping box with bubble wrap on either side is beyond me. You may well want to give the people who run the \\"river-in-SA\\" company a heads up about how they pack your copy before sending it out. One expects better decisions on how to pack a product for shipping when that product costs nearly $200.<br /><br />Still, very highly recommended.experience working with their OIBP technology, and its application to every disc in this set is now a tried-and-true upgrade in terms of getting as much as possible out of the original source material.<br /><br />Playing times on these CDs match their LP lengths, which mean some discs are short by CD standards.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|this was my favorite book before the son of neptune and then the mark of athena came out. highly recomend this book,though anybody getting this book shold read the percy jackson sieries first if you have not already got it. anybody who have not got that sieries won't understand this sieries. again, AWSOME BOOK!!!
B005VTGB0S|4.0|The cover is good, the elastic bands are too tight.  Makes me think it was made in China close, but exactly the same product as the Apple made cover.
B007SGM084|3.0|it was an easy, rainy day kind of book series with not a substantial plot and whiny characters. The first book was great, but after a while you want Ana to stop the simpering and Christian to stop with the attitude.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Hilarious!  Especially for any of you Bean-towners out there. Ted's accent is &#34;wicked&#34;. I never would have watched this movie in the theater because the trailer was so lame. But my son insisted on us watching this over the Christmas holiday and I have to admit it was a riot! I always love Mark Wahlberg movies but I thought what the heck was he thinking with this??? Right on..Markie Mark....Wicked funny.
0307346617|5.0|this was a great read. ... the author was able to keep me reading far into the night to the point that I finished the book in one day... something that I rarely do these days.... highly recommend it, especially for &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; fans.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This was a good purchase and I got it for a good price. It met my expectations and this product also came very quick!
B0063IH60K|3.0|its just plain solitaire cannot . say I love it would prefer more varieties  you can get easily bored after a couple games
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Seamless and entertaining.  Maybe a bit short...the special powers are fun and the graphics and music are pleasing.<br />  Good game.
B00723NWJE|5.0|This CD is more personalized and intimate than previous albums.  It is perfect easy listening on a rainy day.  Just relax and enjoy the most wonderful voice in the world singing with a laid back but provocative aural sensuality; akin to Sade at her best.  Norah does not disappoint.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|this is a fun game! because I use to have one and I deleted it so I know in My heart that this a beginner if! you Want to learn how to play the piano so yeah hope you have. fun! (my 9 year old wrote this review)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was worth the four dollars you have to pay after the demo runs out. It was a bit shorter than I had hoped thought.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Whenever I can play games, I would recon to play this! U can play creative mode of survival mode!!! Tip: MPE is hard, so u may die a lot!!!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Interesting presentation of the agency activity during and after the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs. A bit confusing by interspersing scenes from former movies in a disjointed manner. Not truly enough backround to be relevant.  Hard to accept the new character after 3 Bourne films with Damon.  Another film would be interesting to consider what direction they can take with the plot given the burn down of the current program.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|This movie is funny, appropriate for kids, with simple child-like humor and great Christmas spirit! We will even watch it again!
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Game got old really fast so I uninstalled it because I got bored. Too cumbersome to play on a small phone screen too.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I liked it, but was not what I expected. Sorry. I use my american dictionary on my other tablet. Thanks for trying though.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|When I want to kill time, I play Plants vs. Zombies. I've beaten the game multiple times and love going for all the achievements.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Arrived in plenty of time to give to my brother for Christmas. He said this was his favorite gift. He loved it!
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|Possibly the best horror movie of all time, Stanley Kubrick is an amazing director. Modern directors should take more cues from Kubrick.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put this series of books down.  I liked the characters and became invested in their journey.  Highly recommended!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|The best Christmas story ever written, one to re-read year after year<br />Highly recommended. Dickens at his best, would be good to read aloud to all the family.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Knowing the premise of The Hunger Games, I was reluctant to read this series.  I know it is young adult fiction, but as an adult I could not put the books down.  The subject matter is handled well and I became totally enthralled with the books.  I was invested in the characters and the dilemmas with which they had to deal.  Highly recommended!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Me and my family play it together and we love it ....The game just needs to give u more free gems
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|At epitome of 1960's nuclear war nervousness, released as a comedy after Cuban missile crisis (probably coincidental).  Kubrick gives actors freer hand than usual and gets career-great performances from Sellers, Scott, Hayden, and Wynn.  In the day, many moviegoers could recite entire scenes verbatim.  Still gives laughter and shivers at what-could-have been.  Essential to an understanding of American political psychology, when global was more important than personal.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|My imagination many times thought of ancient Rome, the Holocaust, and modern day struggles to survive. A definite page turner. Love of family, friends, and life centers the story well.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|This book is amazing. Awesome plots and character development. Plus it taught me so much that I didn't know about WWII history. The stuff they don't teach you in history class. I'm excited for the third book!
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|It was a little difficult to transform. many moving parts. There were two pages of instructions on how to fold up into the truck
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I could Not believe how dang Good this movie is! I've watched this movie time and time again, PLEASED with this purchase, Indeed!
145210655X|5.0|I bought this for my father in law. We're all huge Star Wars fans, and the artwork is fantastic, the jokes we know from the series are hilarious. Parents will be turned to the Dark Side of parenting.... just kidding.
0385501560|5.0|It's Chuck Palahniuk. It couldnt be anything less than awesome. I've grown to expect a certain amount of greatness from all of his books. I am rarely ever let down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season had me on the edge of seat the entire time. It's full of twist and turns,can't wait till next season!
B002PNDEXK|5.0|Love it!  It was sweet, romantic and so very &#34;English&#34;.  I especially enjoyed the period costumes and attention to detail.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|My sister told me read these books and I am a soooo glad she did. I couldn't put the book down and now I'm ready to read the next one. Yeah!!! Hope enjoy this book as much as my sister and I did.
B008K8U13K|4.0|I was surprised. It was fun, I enjoyed the difficultly of the levels. I had few complaints about the game, getting emeralds for example was...interesting. Other than that it was great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so awesome now to catching fire......thrill seeking and so interesting I can wait for mocking Jay either!!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I was so afraid this would be one of those movies with the best parts in the trailer but it wasn't! There were so many good parts I don't want to spoil it. This is a must see!!!
B000TU16GS|5.0|This is a fast pace and a great book. Is is a real page turner and a great book for everyone.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Kudos to Preston and Child on Two Graves.  I love the Pendergast series.  Two Graves has some unexpected twists and turns that will take you by surprise.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I gave 4 stars and thought it was very good, however the first is sill my favorite. May the odds be ever in your favor.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|this movie was filthy, and hilarious.  if you are not a fan of low-brow humor, perhaps this isn't for you.  I laughed so hard, we had to re-wind the movie multiple times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Me and my sister always fight over the kindle fire now to play it. But I think it needs updates because 0.4.0 alpha takes you back a bit. So when I found out that it hasn't updated in a long time I was sorta upset. I am hoping that it will update soon!!
B005HIBWFW|5.0|I have been waiting for Ken Russell's The Music Lovers to be released on DVD and it was well worth the wait. The audio is much clearer and you can even hear the actors saying their lines in the background which you could not hear on the VHS version. The stunning visual images are much sharper, too. My only disappointment was that there were no special features. I was hoping, for example,  that Richard Chamberlain and/or Glenda Jackson would have been interviewed about their experiences while making the film. Hopefully, now that The Music Lovers and The Boy Friend have been released on DVD, Ken Russell fans can look forward to DVD releases of The Devils and Mahler, too.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great book very interesting , couldn't stop reading , great page turner ,  I recommend this book to many ,
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Baby loved this doll.  Baby is two and one-half years old and loved the doll.  The doll is very small, but it makes it seem like a newborn, so it was just right.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|it kept my interest.  I like the puzzles in the game.  I can see where you might get frustrated.  the puzzles are not extremely tough yet.
0374531943|5.0|Michael Collins tell's the story of Gemini and Apollo as if you where talking to him in person.<br />Beautifull addition to my Apollo collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The movie sucked, but the book was excellent. It is 3am and I have to work tomorrow and I want to read a preview of the 2nd book.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|The backpack is much smaller than what it seems. Though the camera equipment fits, the pack only comes down halfway on my back. It makes caring it somewhat uncomfortable.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|The bug had more character. I was ready to turn it off at the restaurant. only the fish kept things going. about 30 minutes in one is either inured to how weak the writing is or it gets good enough to watch till the end. in some respects it is typical III of a series. the only thing keeping it going up to the weak end was the almost snappy patter of K and J. why O was even there is a mystery. Unlike I which is rewatchable at intervals or II which is significantly less rewatchable than I. I doubt I'll revisit III  a IInd time.
B001R4KQDE|4.0|I enjoyed the various stories done in comic book style.  I also enjoyed the extra features where Robert Rodriguez teaches how to make tortiallas and potato and egg tacos with jalapenos.  I highly  recommend it.
B005PK553C|1.0|I was interested in this series because of the reviews I had read about Jessica Lange.<br />While she is always good these stories did not hold my interest.  They seem like<br />storylines I have seen before and not done particularly well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an awesome book! I loved reading it very touching story and heartbreaking at the same time. All I can say is amazing
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen DeGeneres. This book was a fun and an easy read. Looking forward to reading more of her books
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I just finished the book and its beautiful! I'm crying, I enjoyed every bit of it! Now I get to watch the movie!!
B0085FF55W|5.0|I really am enjoying this CD. Great tunes. Well played. Well done vocals. Everything flows and no bad tracks. I recommend this highly.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and decided to by the book. Totally worth every penny! I enjoyed it and finished within only a few days! Definitely recommend to anyone who likes a little romance.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Got this as a gift and my teenage daughter could not be happier. She has listened to it multiple times and I feel it was a great purchase.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book challenged me. I fell in love with Characters right away. A very bitter sweet book. I would recommend this.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It did get a bit slow in the middle but I see why the author gave so many details. I really liked it and would recommend it highly.
B001NTXHU2|5.0|This album, released in December 1969 on the cusp of the '70s, was one of the keystone albums that introduced me to the British folk-rock scene, which was ruled by bands like Fairport, Steeleye Span and Pentangle (on the jazzier end of the musical scale). This is among Fairport's best, with rockers and ballads deeply rooted in traditional songs. Sandy Denny's vocals are haunting throughout (she quit the band after the recording), and Richard Thompson's guitar stellar and stinging, but always within the Brit-folk and Celtic idiom here -- no Dylan covers or contemporary rockers. The lead instrument throughout is really Dave Swarbrick's ever-present fiddle, which snakes in and out of the melodies and dances with Thompson and Denny. It's been a long time since I listened to the album in its entirety, and it's great to hear it again.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Entertaining. The story line was kind of there but it's mainly focused on male stripping...Channing Tatum is HOT so worth the watch for fans of his...
B009HEJXFS|5.0|If you like the last two MIB, than you won't be disappointed ! Totally worth the fee to relax at home and have a great movie night.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Give us a little more background on why they needed to take the pills.  Also, expected more coherent plot than was actually there.  Dragged in spots.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This game is not self-explanatory, nor is there instructions on how to play it. I'm probably going to delete this from my library.
B006TTC57C|5.0|Bought this movie as a gift. The minions are the cutest things. Everything was included in the packaging as well as a separate disk to download to different devices.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like the game of solitare and with this version,spider solitare it gave me more of a challenge and that helps alot. a really good way to use up time in many different waiting rooms.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Not flashy or anything. Just a good app that works. I am not a PRIME customer, but this app does everything I need it to do as far as buying, watching, wish listing, etc.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the book after watching the movie, and still couldn't put it down. It is a testament to the author that I was riveted to the page event hough I knew what was going to happen. This is a great read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Pretty fun game for when you are stuck at an airport and it takes a while to finish so it can eat the hours away when you are bored
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Lots of fun and the ability to upgrade different features and repair your buildings means lots of repeat game play.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i really like this game its fun. you can get free gems in this game too just get on everday for like 2 seconds and it will give you some, really really fun!
0385742886|5.0|I loved the Maze Runner trilogy and couldn't wait to get this book. It is a prequel, but doesn't really have anything to do with Thomas or Teresa.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|For starters, all of you are getting fleeced if you are buying this app from Amazon. I won't name where since this might get deleted, but this is free from other, bigger app downloading places.<br /><br />That being said, I have this on my Galaxy S2 and I love it.  I recently bought my son a Nabi 2 for Christmas and this app will not work on it despite being within specs.  It just, for some random reason, will not work on this android device.  My son uses this to go to sleep and I was excited to put this on his Nabi so I could reclaim my phone at night for the short while he takes to go to sleep.  No such luck.  I have contacted support a few times about it with no response back. I'm beginning to wonder if they ignore support requests if they are unsure.<br /><br />For the app itself I would rate this 5 stars for my Galaxy S2.  However, for the Nabi 2, 1 star seeing as how it should work.  As for Amazon, 1 star for the fact they are selling it vs. elsewhere it's always free.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is fun. What sucks is having to pay to really get ahead in it and games like it. Many of us do not have the time to constantly press tiny icons and it would be nice if all the things you could buy in the game were readily available to all users.
B002ZG999U|1.0|The DVD never worked. I sent in a request for them to send a new one and never heard back.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this game a few days ago an I uave to say. IT. IS. AMAZING. GET. IT. NOW. It's a great way to pass time. ;D
1594135851|5.0|can't wait for the new one. .. i did not want to see the movie until i had read the book
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Great! Can you tell i think it is great!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A neat little tool for maintaining an edge on your knives. Nice size, not too big or complicated with many parts like some others. Like the fact that it is designed to enable you to sharpen serrated blades, also! It's not a $300.00 sharpening system but it's functional and inexpensive enough to enable one to purchase several for the BUGOUT bag, tackle box, tool box, garage and kitchen 'junk' drawer! 5 Stars with a Recommended 'Buy' rating!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever. I read Harry Potter a few weeks ago. I was crazy telling everybody to read it. But then when people asked me how good this book was I kept silent, smirked and yelled,\\"GREATEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!\\"
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good game very fun and easy my little brother loves playing it. This game is a very good game to play with spare time.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of Heaven<br />I liked it.  It is pretty much what we all want to hear. I will recommend it.
B005DOKIYG|2.0|The Zip Sleeve has only one use, to protect the Kindle.  It is not a versatile product.  The outer material would be prone to getting soiled and snagged.  The Sleeve is slim in design yet appears to offer decent protection for your Kindle.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Another brilliant Tarantino soundtrack, which accompanies this great movie! Check out the recent Esquire review if you're on the fence about seeing it: Django Unchained Is a Better Movie About Slavery Than Lincoln.  Esquire [...]
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I haven't seen this but my daughter did and she loved it the extended edition she said was great glad I got it for her.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you remember playing it for hours on your first computer than you won't be disappointed.<br />Pretty self explanatory so you can just dive right in.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This is such a great movie wish Alex was in it more but great none the less it's a guilty pleasure for sure
B0086700CM|5.0|Loved it, give it a 10+++!  14 year olds loved this game!! squirrels loved it too as did 5 dogs in the family!!!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|got this for my daughter for christmas I don't understand her wanting it the movie wasn't that good the dancing was great love Channing  Really what's not to love.
B003KRGCTI|5.0|This movie is great in my opinion and I  am not a curch going person but I believe people need something to believe in this movie was more about a purpose driven man.and The movie is about the bible.yes. but its not preachy.not at all.  like people seem to think. I tell you this movie rocks. if it was preachy i proboably wouldnt have watched it.  I loved this movie Give it a try at least you can say you have seen it and can give your own opinion ..I tell ya its proboably not at all what you think.
1595141979|5.0|my daughter loves this so glad I got it for her anything to help a child read is a good thing
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|A true superhero movie in every sense. The way this movies portrays the human & weak side of Batman is just so realistic and amazing. That itself hooks me to it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven is moderately well written. Even though it is fiction it could stick closer to the facts of the actual location chosen for the setting of the book.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  It came quickly.  Was in great shape.  I love the product.  Watch it.  Johnny Depp rocks.
B005HSL626|5.0|Keeps my kids entertained without being innappropriate.  Challenging styles of play, but not too difficult for my almost six year old to enjoy.
0545265355|5.0|I loved this series and got it at a great price.  What can you say about books other than I recommend them.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Move over Christian...hello Gideon! Loved that Eva was not so naive. Loved the love story. Was left hanging until the 2nd book was released!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|So,so, might have been more acceptable without so much of the F word.  No prude, I have been known to use it on occasion, but not in just about every sentence.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Hot hot hot! read it record time as i couldn't put it down. The only part i didn't like was when it ended and the third book wasn't available for download for another 6 months!
0547564651|4.0|This book will be of interest to parents, educators, business people, and those involved in public policy because it looks at a question that lies at the root of many of the issues we argue about in the public sphere:  What is it that makes children grow up to be successful people?  What does it take to succeed in school, in college, and in life?  And is it something that those of us who interact with children can influence?<br /><br />Paul Tough begins by arguing that the \\"cognitive hypothesis\\" is seriously misguided.  This is the idea that what matters most is intelligence and information.  Hence, we must try to get as much as we can into our kids brains, starting with playing Mozart in utero so that they can grow up to be \\"smart.\\"  For example, this theory would imply that what matters in high school is the information you are taught.  Therefore, if you can show by taking a test that you understand the information, you should be just as well off as someone who has sat through four years of classes.  And yet, according to the study he cites by James Heckman, this is not the case.  Though GED holders are more intelligent than high school dropouts, their life outcomes (college completion rates, income, divorce rate, etc.) were more similar to high school dropouts  than high school graduates.  The issue was that success requires the discipline and persistence to see a task through, even when it takes a long time and may seem boring or pointless at times.<br /><br />So, the point of this book is that character matters--in school, and broadly, in life.  And the key character traits that matter are not what he terms \\"moral character:\\" fairness, generosity, inclusion, tolerance--the things that most school character programs emphasize; but rather \\"performance character:\\" those old fashioned concepts like hard work, conscientiousness, and persistence.<br /><br />Tough argues that these character traits can be taught and fostered in young people as they mature and that this would be a place where we should focus our efforts as parents, teachers, and public policy makers.  He uses two key case studies to explore these concepts.  One is a character building program that is a joint effort between an inner city KIPP charter school and a tony private school catering to wealthy parents.  The other is a champion middle school chess program in a New York City public school.<br /><br />Ultimately, I didn't think that he fully clarified exactly how this could be done on a broader scale, but he certainly tells a number of engaging stories of individual success and cites current research relating to the power of character.  This book will extend the conversation on character, but leaves room for others to continue exploring these issues.  It will leave you with a lot to ponder, especially if you are responsible for any children or young adults.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|I did not see in the description that there are pop-up ads on the screen.  The flashlight worked fine, but it was nearly impossible to use without inadvertantly clicking on an ad, so we uninstalled it immediately, especially since it was on our child's Kindle Fire.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Wow. An incredible book about an incredible man. By turns thrilling, inspiring, funny, insightful, and heart-breaking. I turned to Goodwin's doorstop of a tome because Spielberg's LINCOLN movie hooked me, and though the movie covers only the veriest sliver of TEAM OF RIVALS, both are excellent. It was also fun to see where bits of the movie came from, the Ethan Allen anecdote, for example.<br /><br />My only regret is that the Kindle edition does not include all the sections of photographs found in the print version ( and which I pored over when I saw a copy at Christmas).<br /><br />If you read only one history book this year, make it this one! While you'll sigh over how politics are politics, you'll meet the brilliant man who both played the game masterfully and rose above.
0880796863|5.0|Bought this as a gift and was delighted everyone knew this deck. It is the one.<br />I am going to take another customers advice and buy a good book to go with the deck. Still researching that and will update. I love this and think collectors will like design.
B009XEE0DW|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Mylene Farmer. Mylene has her own distinctive style, different from any other singer I know and she never disappoints. \\"Monkey Me\\" is no exception. Unlike many \\"pop\\" albums that come out today with a few outstanding tracks and the rest of the songs being just \\"ok\\", the track line up on THIS album is very strong.The songs have a dark and poppie feel with nice melodic refrains that are guarenteed to hook the listener. This album (for me) seems to reach back to her earlier styles (like on her \\"L'Autre\\" CD).In fact, Laurent Boutonnant is back in the picture as a collaborator again. Mylene's voice  sounds as good as ever as she performs in styles encompassing pop,dance,and ballads, all arranged in a sweet, light,and catchy pop style. In my opinion, this album is one of her strongest releases to date, and will be an excellent addition to your Mylene Farmer collection.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is a fun little game to play. My only problem with it is the energy pool. Every task requires energy and some tasks require several energy. You only have 20 energy which is not enough to get much done. You can purchase more energy for bucks (not coins) but bucks cost real money!
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|I always wanted to play the piano and now I can. We passed this around at Christmas time and had alot of fun.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|I don't mind saying how I liked the movie, but I don't have any other comments - IS THAT OK ?!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game.  Very addicting!  Bought it for christmas. Family enjoys it too! Going to buy the next one
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Yeah it was funny, a simple star rating would work better, cause I'm simply not going to write out a review of each movie every time.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Very nice group, most songs are great also stories behind songs,ballads. Since I gave it 5 stars, I recommend this group-JAB
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Once you start to play you wont want to stop. You will become addicted. Very challenging and you will get angry at the birds.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|One of my favourite books EVER!!! I bought this on kindle first and loved it so much I bought the hard copy too. Fascinating and captivating it had such a broad spectrum of coverage. Love all of Tim Ferris's work, he is a wonderful author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love solitaire You will love this game. Many different deals available. Can be addictive too. So enjoy yourself and challenge friends.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I put this on my kindle to entertain my grandsons on a recent trip where they (ages 2 and 3) were required to  be kind of quiet for a period of time and this surely helped.  I watched it with them, as I have many times, and it never fails to engage them.  We took them to the new CARS exhibit at Disneyland last week where they were able to &#34;meet&#34; their favorite cars characters and they were just thrilled.  If you have small children, this is a wonderful dvd with good values and lots of colorful action.
B001NAT05W|1.0|Worst movie I have ever seen. Wouldn't waste my time to watch this out of curiosity. Unable to find anything about it that is positive. Viewer beware.
0062200909|5.0|I have all of the concept art books for the Lord of the Rings movies. Obviously I had to have one for the Hobbit. Since Weta produces this book, you get to see all of their concept sketches. What makes it awesome is you also get to read the thoughts of the crew designing and making the items. I am looking forward to the concept art books for Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again if this book is any indication of how those will look.
B0087240Z4|2.0|I liked all the old stuff, and even liked Adore and Machina.  When you read more about this album (compilation, really) online, you will wonder why paid money for it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a fantastic read, like all of her other books.I couldn't put this book down, however I absolutely despise the ending, almost to the point I wish I didn't read the book, I'm pretty conflicted about how I feel about the whole story, which I suppose is the point. Sharp objects is better, read that one!
B0090YHSFC|3.0|good game for passing time. Also good game for free! My grand kids love it very addictive game. Good for kids and parents also.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|After reading all of the very high ratings for quite some time, I expected a game that would be better than what it turned out to be. I have to say, I like games like Quell, Refraction, kona's Crate, and Machinarium much better. I'm VERY glad I waited for it to be the faotd and didn't spend the too high price of $5 for it. Maybe that's why they don't offer a 'lite' try it before you buy it version. The only thing I can say, the game does work as it should on the KF with no issues. It just seems outdated and kind of boring. With all the other good new games out there these days, maybe they should consider lowering the price, or updating the game so it's more interesting. So that's my frotd (free review of the day) .
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Love the Movie! The only reason that it is not 5 Stars is because the movie case was cracked and the paper was little torn where the case was cracked. I'm upset about that, but not enough to let go of this great movie!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A wonderful movie. The Griswold family antics are a joy to watch, and there's even a moral. A must watch Christmas movie.
B0000542DH|3.0|Not what I expected.  Good movie, but I didn't like how it was filmed.  If it had been filmed like an actually movie and a little less over the top, I would've enjoyed it more.  You can tell it's a Taratino film but I like his stuff, I think Oliver Stone messed it up by re-doing it.
B002B790YC|1.0|The seller made was on the DVD movie purchase site with this musical score only for the movie, misleading had to return after some hassle to do so.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas, she loves them!  They are just the ones I was looking for! Perfect size for the advanced Lego lover in your life!
B0018B1O7I|5.0|One of greatest albums by the greatest  band ever. It sets the standards for what an album should be about, talent.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie arrived in all it's brand new wrappers and putter cardboard movie box. It's a funny movie with lots of good music. Good teen and young adult movie.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I thought this movie was ok. I did not think it was a great movie. There's times when I sort of lost interest but would get back into it.
B004X75RK4|2.0|It was hard to keep watching it. We didn't stop because it was too late tto start another movie. Otherwise, we would have bailed out.
B009HELT3C|5.0|it was funny and it had a plot to it ad ate the end u find out why he cared so much
1935251740|5.0|I've thought about stuff like this my whole life. The world \\"out there\\"  is just NOT what you think it is. The equipment you dream with when you sleep is the same stuff with which you experience your \\"life\\".  Neither \\"experience\\" is \\"real\\". Sorry for all the quotation marks.  What you know is not necessarily right.  You do not exist the way you think you do. If you have read or are reading this book you have stumbled on to something very profound.<br /><br />The first chapter contains  some of the most important ideas  you will ever know. Read this book carefully.<br /><br />Mere words are not enough to describe just how...magnificent YOU are!<br /><br />There are some who will scoff at these ideas. Do your own research. Get  \\"The Seth Material\\"  by Jane Roberts  for a simple explanation of how you are...put together.<br /><br />Some notable scientists have noted recently that we may exist in a simulation. Indeed we do! WE are the simulators! Other scientists say there is \\"Dark matter\\" and \\"Dark Energy\\". Of course there is! This is un-realized \\"stuff\\" that an \\"observer\\" hasn't been \\"aware\\" of! Once again forgive the quotes...mere words...<br /><br />Here is a mind bender: The Hubble Space Telescope can see \\"infant\\" galaxies so far away [13.5 billion light years] that they must have formed soon after the \\"Big Bang\\"  This means the light from those objects is 13.5 billion years old. The \\"speed limit\\" for light is 186,000 miles per second. Mere matter CANNOT go that fast!  HOW did those objects get so far away if they can't  move at the speed of light? Are we looking at the back of our heads? Is the universe a circle ? Just where the heck are we anyway? What is light? What is matter? What is speed? What is distance? What is space? See? ALL of these IDEAS are YOURS! They exist nowhere else! YOUR ideas are unique. No one else has them! YOUR existence is yours alone!<br /><br />Water is not \\"wet\\". Our experience of it is \\"wet\\". Oxygen and Hydrogen are as dry as popcorn! There are many things like this. There is no time and there is no space...here are many things like this. There is no time and there is no space...
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Just when I thought I had this book figured out out would throw me a new curve. It kept me up at night to get to the end. Anybody that has an interest in symbols masons and possibly true history should read this
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down once I started. Well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. More than worth the read
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Still an endearing Christmas story. The book is short but sweet.  I saw the movie which obviously extends the story; both are excellent.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a gift for my son, he loves it. All Star Wars, All blue ray. It is what it is.
B005NGKLX2|5.0|I had often heard that Butch and Sundance didn't die at the bank shootout but I don,t see how they could. Anyway..I really liked this movie . It stands on it's own, with the senery,music,actors and story line. A nice addition to my weastern collection.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Decent movie. Even hubby liked it and he normally doesn't care too much for my chick flicks. :) I would recommend it.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever! It is gorgeous, has beautiful music, acting is amazing. couldn't ask for more!
6305754969|4.0|It would have been nice if the move was not open and a fingure print on it but it is great condetion have not watched it yet so dont know if it skips but my husband was very happy come xmas morning
B003L77GH4|5.0|We all love this show. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she was so excited! Like I said, Big fans!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love this movie have nothing bad to say it came in one piece and plays great cant stop watching it
B001LF347E|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! Going to buy the other seasons for Easter. Love it!
1419705849|5.0|Keaton has been reading the whole series so this just adds to his collection.  He seemed happy with it which was good.
B0045HCIYA|5.0|Great movie for a great price. This movie makes me laugh so much! It was a great deal at this price!
B004H4XLRE|3.0|This toy is made from a less expensive plastic when you think of Disney you think when they stamp their name you would get a higher quality item, probably will last a couple of months
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I love the this series. I bought 2 of these this year. One for myself and one for my daughter. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!
B0051XJ9YE|4.0|Wheels on car not good, color great, small kids love these cars from Disney movie, need several cars to go with other purchases
B0096DZKZC|1.0|This game will not download. I've tried several times and always get the same responce.... &#34;download failed!&#34; Not worth the hastel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I choose to read John Green books because he understands the human-ness that we all try so hard to see. Reading his stories isn't about escaping or about hiding, but rather about finding out about the human-ness of it all and embracing it.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game worked perfectly on my kindle fire.  The hidden object scenes were just<br />tough enough to be fun.  I want to play it again to try and get all the beyond objects.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that, as seems to happen to a lot of games, it feels like the developers were rushed at the end or they were out of diabolical puzzles.  Overall, good game.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I Loved watching Pretty Little Liars on ABC Family. I wanted to enjoy PLL time & time again so i decided to buy season 1 on DVD. Evrywhere elce i looked the price was outrageous & way out of my price range. A great oder from Amazon.com. I am very pleased with this product.
B0035JRVBO|1.0|he is retarded, why is he so stupid, terrible movie, duhhh im forrest gump duhh ahaha i can run like hell
B0058YPGVQ|4.0|i love this show, it is getting very silly but still alot of fun to watch. This season was starting to get back on the right track
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good game, but better legends or instructions about truck routes would be helpful.  Also, a better way to know how much upgrades cost.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|It's Dexter! Who doesn't love the way he gives badguys what they deserve ;)  Love how he has a baby too, so cute!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Funny to see these actors but predictable just one of those things you felt you had to see if you saw the first one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book speaks of the rare kind of love that many look for but few find. Very heat warming. Definitely recommend.
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|I thought it could have had the same outcome in 20 minutes as it did in almost two hours just okay in my book.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|It was a page turner. I can't believe all the surprises and return characters. Another savory morsel in the feast of the outlander series.
B009HELT3C|3.0|Good actors so you would think it would be decent, I don't like supernatural but appeased my husband, we have seen them all and this was not as good as the others.
0345441184|5.0|I read this book many years ago and it still to this day stands out as one of my favorite books of all time. I've read it over and over!
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|Not much story just too much gore didn't need it to make a point.Its like they figured out the gore then wrote a story around it.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|There is no question this book, and the entire series, earned 5 stars!  As the intricate story unfolds, leaving you eagerly wanting more, you envision a life of what fantasies are made of.  Only you MUST keep reading because you can not fathom what us coming next.  To be the unconventional heroin Mac or her soul mate Barrons, this is a love story like no other.  Thank you Karen Marie Mining!!!!!
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This one just plain insulted my intelligence which I should have known but guess we just had to prove it! Gross
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I wasn't sure how I felt about the book at first, it was a different read than what I'm used to , however I'm happy I read it. I couldn't help but feel bad for Charlie though, he's so innocent and naive.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game!  l love to play when. there's. nothing. better. to do and its snowing outside and its warm inside.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Had borrowed my daughter's first 3 seasons and couldn't quit---needed to see all seven.  My special Christmas present to me.
B00338QENI|4.0|This is a true story of deception and racism manifested within the world of human medical experimentation in the 1940's and continuing to some extent through to today.  This is not a story of evil. Most of the participants were well intended and operating within what was considered morally acceptable at the time.  This book will educate you, anger you a bit, and force you to question even today's moral perogatives.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Have enjoyed many of Mr. Follett's books.  I was reading this in book form and was leaving on a trip.  Had it put on my Kindle for the convenience while traveling.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|needless to say this gets interesting but it has opened my wife to possibilities.  While she hasn't said anything, things are certainly more interesting since she began reading it AND she is much more involved in making sure she is completed and that makes me even happier.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this. Now I want to watch the movie! The end left me hanging enough to read book number two!
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Reasoning behind the one star is it causes freezes and there is no room for error. You can not even miss one lum.
0140042520|5.0|This is timeless and inspiring. i buy it for many people who think Kerouac is just &#34;On the Road&#34; .
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I gave this only 2 stars because i have no idea why it chooses to tell me what is lost or what is won. So it is not a very consistent app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book! Saw the first movie then decided to read the books! Great book! Should've read first then watched the movie!
0553565915|4.0|We have experienced no problems with  this product.  It arrived on time, and we are completely satisfied with the service.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Easy to use, just press it, and put this stuff over the processor, once installed in their socket. Don't let much time until put over the cooling and dissipation system. make sure both make contact.
B001I189MQ|5.0|Batman got even better!<br />The new trilogy and gives back the respect to the Batman series. It was sort of lost after those movies that were sort of a joke, like Batman being played by George Clooney, and takes being done of their butts when putting up the Batman suit.<br />This movie is even better than the &#34;Batman begins&#34;, the Joker is a really must see and really deserved the Oscar he got! Batman strikes again as a savior, deep, strong... a real Dark Knight!<br />The phrasing that is said in the end, at the very last scene of the movie is legendary!<br /><br />SEE IT! Then watch Dark Knight Rises!
B006YM9JSW|4.0|Its a very fast and good processor with LGA2011 socket. It doesn't come with cooling system, so you have to choose one. but there is a lot of available. To install the processor is easy, its only fits in one position. but depend on the cooling system that you buy, it could be very tricky. but is very important. this kind of processor tends to get very hot and could be damaged if don't get enough hot dissipation.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Been waiting for years for it to come out on blu-ray. It's hokey and hilarious, scary (sort of) and silly, and I love it a little more every time I see it. I'm sure not everyone will agree, but I consider it a Sci-Fi classic.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|Excellent movie. We are always riveted when watching this movie. The filming and sets were done extremely well. Tim and Morgan gave excellent performances. Don't miss it.
0140544518|5.0|I remember reading this book as a kid so I ventured and found it again. I still enjoy it. Reading a classic from a different perspective is fun, especially in a picture book format. I imagine (just like another reviewer stated) that that old wolf has a sly, southern accent when I read it. SO as you can tell, I adore this book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a great game to play when you have nothing to or when you want to play just for fun :)
B00003OSTK|5.0|They don't come any better! Out of this remarkable cast, Lionel Barrymore runs away with the very finest role he has ever shown! (yes, even though his brother, John Barrymore, plays a most compassionate, romantic role at the top of his fame!)<br />This is definitely a movie for your collection, to be watched over and over again.
B00A5IYXY6|5.0|Read the script about the inspector buying a pineapple, and you'll find nothing to laugh at. Watch it onscreen and you'll double over.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I've only done levels 1 and 2. Level 1 is challenging if you haven't been working out in a long time. Level 2 is much more difficult and makes me a little worried about what level 3 will bring. Just give me a few more days and I'll be ready for the challenge!<br /><br />I really like that the workouts are only about 20 minutes long, which makes it really easy to fit into my schedule. I've noticed that I'm a little stronger now after a few weeks. I'd recommend this DVD.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|It you love this show like I do, you will enjoy having this.  It is really great watching and seeing some scenes that aren't included in the shows in syndication.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Usually when I read books I can't get hooked. But with this book it was instantaneous! I started reading it on Christmas! I am surprised.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory!  I didn't start watching it until it first went into syndication, so I missed out on the first couple of seasons.  There are scenes that I hadn't seen before.  It is great!
B005LAIHR2|2.0|I was going to give this only one star, but the music used in the movie made me give it two stars. I wanted to like this movie so bad, but it was just plain weird at some points;and the acting was really corny. The music in the movie is really good, but the plot for this movie was just horrible. There were so many times when I just wanted to turn it off, but I was still enjoying the music. I'm trading this in for an Amazon gift card if that tells you anything!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I can't get enough of it!!! Can't wait to see more!! This show is thrilling and keeps you guessing on what's going to happen next....
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is something special. It really is more than a book. Its hard to explain, you just have to read it to understand. I would really recommend this book to everyone.
0545425115|5.0|The Hunger Games lives up to its reputation as one of the best young adult books from the past couple years.  I know I'm coming to this realization a bit later than most, but there are reasons for this.  From friends I had heard enough about The Hunger Games to glean a basic understanding of the plot and premise of the book, and I was reluctant to read the series because I am not a fan of dystopian or post-apocalyptic novels, having read dystopian novels in the past.  When I finally broke down and read The Hunger Games, I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least, that it didn't match my preconceptions.<br /><br />I would characterize the first book as more about action, less about the struggle between the districts and the capitol.  The plot moved fast without forsaking any explanations or descriptions, the characters were well-developed and very interesting, and overall, the book sucked me in from page one.  At times I became frustrated with Katniss because it seemed like she was oblivious to what the people around her were planning, though I thought it was fairly clear.  She gradually started to understand more and more, and as things became clearer for Katniss, I became less frustrated with her.<br /><br />I am very pleased that I finally decided to read this book, and to those who might be hesitant for the same reasons I was, I would just like to say that this is not the typical dystopian novel.  The Hunger Games is engaging, well-written and worth your time to read.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I think this is a great way to learn words you don't know that are ahead of you current learning path which allows you to be consider high in vocabulary level by you fellow colleges/students.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the second book in the Hunger Games series, continuing where the cliff-hanger ending in The Hunger Games stopped.  In this book we learn what the repercussions are following Katiniss's stunt with the night lock that saved her and Peeta.  What Katniss didn't know was that that act served as a catalyst - a spark - that is beginning to ignite all the districts.  President Snow tasks Katniss with putting out that spark, otherwise the consequences for herself and Panem will be dire.  Catching Fire starts with Peeta and Katniss's victory tour, which is where Katniss is supposed to quell the growing rebellion.  It's also where Katniss sees what life is like outside her own district.<br /><br />Catching Fire widens focus from just Katniss's own troubles and quarrel with the capital, to the greater unrest that lies throughout Panem.  This book is much more intriguing than the first, readers learn more about Panem and the cruelty of the capitol.  There's a definite shift in the book to not just action, but also explanations on why things are the way they are.  More mysteries are introduced to the reader, such as the status of District 13.  At times Catching Fire moved slower than I would have liked.  It was also occasionally frustrating when Katniss was struggling with decisions and not able to understand what was going on, even when it was clear to the reader.  In the end, though, this contributed to Katniss's growth and that was enjoyable to read.<br /><br />This was a great second book, and it definitely makes the reader even more excited to read the final in the series.  Readers will enjoy learning more about Panem, and the growth of the characters and their relationships are a strength in this book.
1419705849|5.0|Came in earlier than I expected and was a lot easier than fighting in a store trying to get a copy in time for Christmas
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  In my opinion, Mockingjay and Catching Fire could be one long book, and Mockingjay should be read soon after Catching Fire so all the details will be fresh.  Of all the books, this was the most different.  New characters are introduced, there are many different twists, and the nature of the plot changes.  No longer is Katniss confused about how she feels about the capitol, and no longer is she alone.<br /><br />Moockingjay was very different from the first two books, but I thought it was one of the most intriguing.  There were many twists I couldn't anticipate, Katniss finally accepted what her part in the rebellion would be, and the new characters were just as good as the ones who had been in the series from the start.  The changes between this book and the first two made sense in the progression of the story: they represented the next logical step for the characters and for the struggle against the capitol.  At times events moved too swiftly, I was unsure of what had happened and had to read some sections of the book over.  This was a bit distracting, but it was also a realistic portrayal of the action as it was unfolding.  Mockingjay is written in first-person, and Katniss didn't have time to reflect on what was going on, so it wasn't included in the book.  Some readers will be more annoyed with this than others, I found it a bit confusing, but it was simple enough to go back and read certain parts over again for clarification.<br /><br />Mockingjay - and the entire Hunger Games series - didn't conclude how I expected it to, but not in an unpleasant way.  I found this book to be as captivating as the entire series had been, and honestly, you can't really read the first two books and then not finish the trilogy.  I would highly recommend the Mockingjay and the Hunger Games to anyone, regardless of what type of books they usually read.
B0084AZXKK|1.0|The all time worst book a teacher ever made me read I wouldn't make my worst enemy read this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing<br /><br />·I would recommend this book to all ages<br />·I love it because it has so much detail and the pictures tell about 40% of the story
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Truly a remarkable job. Another Riordan masterpiece. Well worth the read. Great character development, and sets up well for the next book. Can't wait!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book related to mine and my best friends life so well and I'll tell all of my friends to read it. It is very inspirational and I bet it will help me and other people through a lot
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was filled with questions it left you thinking eBay is going to happen next I was blown away
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book,  I know I am the daughter of Apollo for sure and I know all the half bloods in this story, I love this book so much
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story helps you believe that oppression can be thwarted with the human heart.  This uplifting book is set in an a dark time in humanity, yet shows the resilience of the human soul.  The Hunger Games is addicting and satisfying at the same time.

B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is the moat addicting game I've never owned! I've also gotten all of my friends addicted to it as well. must have game for your tablet!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This was an alright film.  I felt that it dragged on and constantly reminded us of how great Jason Bourne is. Legacy goes into more background and side stories from the Bourne universe, and while interesting was not necessary. Jeremy Renner does a fine job here though and just adds to his great year of films.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have seen. Its time to let this series die. The movie has no plot and is just a bunch of running around and shooting. Im sorry that I paid money to watch it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wasn't expecting the ending! Can't wait to read the next one! Leaves me wanting more! Loved reading it on my kindle!
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I bought this CD along with Rodriguez' CD Coming from Reality as a result of seeing the movies Searching for Sugar Man.  Although I am not a rock and roll fan, I found this music interesting and understandable because I could understand the lyrics.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I bought this CD as a result of seeing the movie Searching for Sugar Man.  I am not a fan of rock and roll,  but I can actually understand the lyrics on this CD.  Very nice music for driving.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series is a celebration of life, and makes me long for simpler times. It was a great discovery, kind of addicting to watch, and I loved every episode. There is so much love in there. My only regret is that they canceled the show before its time.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|For the price, this is a really nice watch. I'm a big fan of Seiko watches and this is my second one, and my first automatic watch. It wears nicely on the wrist and you can hardly even notice that it's there. It is a little on the small side so people with big wrists, take notice. But onr thing I love about it is the sweeping second hand, it really adds to it and I love the calendar and date.<br /><br />The reason why I'm giving this watch four stars is because of the calendar. I really wanted it to be in all English units and I could not find a review that said it was not. That being said, the calendar is bilingual and because I work night shift, the calendar switches over when I need to see it and unfortunately I can't read Spanish. But, I think that is a very small gripe all things considered because I know many watches with calendars do that and unless you want to spend big money you won't be able to find one with all English units.<br /><br />I would absolutely consider picking one up for a gift, especially if the person on the receiving end likes watches
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Bought this for a friend who bought an investment property and hired the wrong people to remodel.... &#34;How long will it take to fix it?&#34;.....&#34;Two weeks&#34; ....Ha!
0375704027|5.0|I cannot review this. It was a gift for a friend. Will purchase items like this again in the future.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am not a reader or book fan at all but got a kindle for Christmas and came across this book while learning about my new toy I decided to down load it and in less then two days finished the book. It is an amazing story that just pulls your full attention in. I am so impressed with the book I am going to try and read the authors other best sellers.  Thank you to the author for making me see what all the hype is about reading for pleasure I have a new hobby
B000001FDK|5.0|The music is still as great as the movie.  It's a classic.  Brings back great memories for me and my wife.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Definatly deserves five stars!! Couldn't help but read it five times! Even better than the movies- :)<br />Your crazy if you don't like them!
1607885719|5.0|I bought this for a stocking stuffer for my daughter.  We previously had listened to Zero Day.  She is very pleased with it!  Once again, &#34;Santa&#34; comes through!
B008J34466|5.0|Paid  a fair price on this CD and it shipped fast. I like the CD a lot.  Would use this vendor again.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This product was priced fairly shipped fast. Would recommend using this vendor.  I enjoy the mellow sounds of Jason Mraz

B005HSG3TC|5.0|Light weight and good protection...great combo for someone always on the go like me! I would really recommend this case.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a great book it was jaw dropping I could not stop reading it left me on the edge of my seat I can't wait till the next book I want it to be in my hands to find out if Percy and annabeth  get out I hope the gods win I think u should read this it will make you begging for more
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book. I enjoyed the creativity of the scenes and the imagination to be able to create the such people, things, and dialogue in this book.  Actually in the whole trilogy.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|I don't think anyone has me laughing at his songs more than Paul Gilbert, and yet the music is good and the guitar playing is extraordinary. Out of all my Christmas albums, this one has caught my attention first. You can expect rock, jazz, funk, a little blues, and some humor to go with all of that.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Just another five star review. Her songs are great, but are even better when you watch her videos. Every song on this album is good.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It looks great on Kindle and they have an absolute blast playing it.  If you like Angry Birds on an iPhone screen you'll love it on a bigger screen.  Great features and graphics.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I never right reviews but this book was great.<br />I highly recommend it.<br />I also recently finished The Shoemakers Wife which I also highly recommend
0385535147|5.0|Grisham has again brought us a great read.  Once started it is hard to put down.  The intrigue is a bit different from some of his others books, but does bring in the attorney who usually shows up in the books.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Got to catch up on the series very happy with purchase and would do so again . . . .
B002Z0TPFE|4.0|Good action movie! Defiantly a guy movie, don't try to watch it with the wife on a date night ha ha
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I think that Google is the best search engine on the net. I never use anything but Google!!!! Thank you Google!!!
B000FC10WU|4.0|Miss Marple does it again. I love her \\"power of deductions\\" as Sherlock would say. Recommend this book to any mystery novel lover.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|now I have the next version on my android. if it weren't for the slow amazon updates I would buy it from here rather than the play store it's. 2.0.2 here but 2.0.3 in the play store
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  The mix of songs in great and the jazzed up version of old classics is perfect.  I love to have this CD playing while I am doing my Christmas baking!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book kept me enthralled.  It's interesting to see Katniss slowly begin to accept her male counterpart as the story progresses.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Been on for quite awhile.Like keeping up with family. Have alot of problems with the games. Can be very aggrevating.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This film has quickly found it's way into my Top Ten Desert Island choices. Every aspect of it from the writing, directing, music and art directing, acting is perfection. I'm sure it will become &#34;a Classic&#34; that will wear very well over time since the primary issue that it deals with---the coming of age outsider's search for privacy and respect is such a universal experience.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was awesome! I couldnt put it down.  I love this author.  Her books are easy reading but also grip you to your seat! Please read this book!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It would not download at first but my problem was that it was using the incorrect account to pay. If it does not download for you make sure your default payment settings are correct. Great game, very addicting.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Having seen the movie a number of times, I was surprised how little I actually knew about the characters and the challenges they faced.  I am anxious to read the rest of the series
B008645YH6|5.0|Marina's sophomore album, &quot;Electra Heart&quot; builds upon, her wonderful artistry. The follow to 2010 album, &quot;The Family Jewels&quot;, Marina spent around two years producing this record. While, Electra still features thought provoking lyrics, it's musical is new direction for Marina. The new record features a more electronic sound. I hesitant to call &quot;POP&quot;, while does have many pop elements, the album's poetry is far deeper and meaningful, then a casual pop song. &quot;Electra Heart&quot;'s main purpose can easily be uncovered through a listening session - to tell the tragic tale of Electra's (the vehicle of the album) life. The American edition, I'm reviewing contains 14 tracks. &quot;Radioactive&quot; and &quot;Sex Yeah&quot; are bonus tracks on the deluxe edition found in the UK, while &quot;How To Be a Heartbreaker&quot; is a US exclusive track. &quot;Living Dead&quot; from the UK edition, has sadly been omitted, but strongly suggest American Diamonds listen to the track. (It should be available on YouTube. If you like it, you should order the UK edition of &quot;Electra Heart&quot; as well as the American.)<br /><br /> Track Reviews:<br /><br />1. Bubblegum Bitch<br />The album is opener, is fun and sassy. The lyrics act as clues as to the rest of the album. Defiantly a standout track. The lyrics are basic description of the album's main character, Electra. She wants love, but isn't afraid to be assertive and stand up for herself when taken advantage of. Her strong side is shown in this song.<br />&quot;I'll chew you up and I'll spit you out. Cause that's what young love is all about&quot;<br />10/10<br /><br />2. Primadonna<br />The first official single from the album. It's perfect first single. Forty second intro draws in the listener, just as the beat kicks in. The lyrics speak of Electra's need to be adored, as well as spoiled characteristic. The infectious lyrics are still dancing in my head, but I'm not complaining! The backing vocals cooing &quot;WOW&quot;, &quot;YEAH&quot; and &quot;OOH&quot;, were a really nice touch.<br />9.6/10<br /><br />3. Lies<br />After a lamenting intro starring Marina's fine vocals, &quot;Lies&quot; dives into Electra questioning her relationship's credibility. The instrumental works very well with vocal permanence, and the lyrics. Proof (along with Primadonna) that Dr. Luke can be just as great as any indie-producer's song.<br />&quot;What's the point of the playing, a game you're gonna lose? What's the point in saying you 'love me like a friend'?&quot;<br />9.3/10<br /><br />4. Homewrecker<br />An airy intro, with spoken words, set the stage for this anthem's theme. &quot;I don't belong to anyone&quot;. Written as a response to &quot;Lies&quot;, &quot;Homewrecker&quot; finds the protagonist coming back, and breaking hearts &quot;just for fun&quot;. She proves that she belongs to no one, and that she is the heart-breaker, not broken.<br />&quot;I'm only happy when I'm on the run, I break a million hearts just for fun. I don't belong to anyone&quot;<br />10/10<br /><br />5. Starring Role<br />Similar to &quot;Lies&quot;, Electra is unhappy with her lover, however in &quot;Starring Role&quot; she much more assertive, however her broken heart can still be heard underneath the strong exterior. &quot;I'd rather walk alone&quot; &quot;Fed up with the fantasies&quot;. She dismisses her role in her lovers heart as too small, wishing to be the star. The production creates a sense of anxiety, as if the relationship is on the edge of shattering.<br />9.5/10<br /><br />6. The State of Dreaming<br />The song seems to recall the &quot;Electra&quot; is a fictional character lived through on the album. &quot;I've been living a state of dreaming&quot;. Or it may recall that Electra lives in her own world, where her perspective on others is altered/warped. &quot;Living in a make believe land&quot;. There is a certain sadness to the track, in all it's airy beauty.<br />9/10<br /><br/>7. Power &amp; Control<br />In the album's second single, the protagonist in at odds in her relationship. This time, is seemingly over dominance, and heartbreak. Electra has decided to break her lover's heart, before her heart is shattered, while also a playing a game. She desires to make him fall, hard. She is no longer under his control.<br />&quot;we can't have peace, without a war&quot;<br />10/10<br /><br />8. Sex Yeah<br />&quot;Sex, sex, sex sells&quot; chimes. The beat of the introduction brings to mind factory work line, where soulless pop stars, are somehow mechanically produced. The song then announces that history has given little to allow people to be who they are. They're lives mapped out for them, due to gender, among other factors. The protagonist wants to find what history and society can give to her that's positive, at the same time encouraging listeners to question their morals, and the morals of the society.<br />10/10<br /><br />9. Teen Idle<br />The ode to regretted youth is emotionally devastating. The song connects to both adults and teens. Teens relate, who feel pressures of their age. I feel youth these days are put under much more pressure then the previous generation. Adults connect, as there are regrets from their youth. Easily one of, if not the best song on &quot;Electra Heart&quot;, the song mixes sad vocals, with up beat cheer. &quot;Feeling *Super Super Super* suicidal&quot;. The bridge brings the song full circle with self-deprecating lyrics of fear of living a lonely life. Eventually the protagonist &quot;dies, only to find I've come to life&quot;. A possible rebirth?<br />10/10<br /><br />10. Valley of Dolls<br />The protagonist cannot go on in her current form. It seems her identities are crushing her, she wishes to just sleep in &quot;the Valley of the Dolls&quot;. While it's tenor is downcast, a feeling of hope somehow permeates it. As if, she is letting go of her other personalities. Can she now just be herself?<br />&quot;But to zero, here we go again. Racing again into oblivion&quot;<br />These lyrics to me, recall &quot;Numb&quot; on Marina's debut.<br />10/10<br /><br />11. Hypocrates<br />An more upbeat song after the darker section of the album, Electra is finally done with the relationship. She comes to complete terms with his actions and his hypocritical behavior. The lightness of the track, seems to suggest she is not longer saddened by the relationship. She is just calling him out, no wars.<br />8.9/10<br /><br />12. How to Be a Heatbreaker<br />A lesson on how to be a hearbtreaker, Electra encourages having fun, and looking pure. She suggests not getting attached, as well never wearing a your heart on your sleeve. She now know how to keep her heart unbroken, and how to break to the others. She isn't taking anymore risks in love.<br />&quot;Girls don't, we don't want our hearts to break into... So it's better to be fake&quot;<br />9/10<br /><br />13. Radioactive<br />One of the first songs debuted off &quot;Electra Heart&quot;, &quot;Radioactive&quot; sees Electra finds a love that makes her feel electric.... Radioactive even. Easily the most electronic song on the album, Electra states &quot;I'm the one who left you&quot;, not the other way around. It does makes sense to place Radioactive, after Heartbreaker, even thought their recording dates are far apart.<br />8.5/10<br /><br />14. Fear &amp; Loathing<br />The conclusion to Electra's journey. It begins with a reflection of her life. It admits to the multitude of personalities, and her bitterness. However, she is not truly changed. She's realized that she must let go of her negativity. She is done with fruitless effort of &quot;having it all&quot;. She has been saved, free to live in happiness now. The track ends with a haunting vocal by Marina's grandmother. It's beautiful, and strangely fitting.<br />&quot;I wanna touch the edge of greatness. Don't wanna be completely faithless.&quot;<br />10/10<br /><br /> &quot;Electra Heart&quot; is not &quot;The Family Jewels&quot;, but why would you want the same album twice? Both are masterpieces in my opinion. It's Marina has stretched into territory - the sound works quite well. This album is one that requires analyzing and input. It's poetry will leave breathless - on the edge of greatness.
B00867GJYK|5.0|It was worth the wait!  The colors are beautiful in Blu-Ray. Great movie for the whole family. Plenty of material to keep adults entertained too.
141659521X|3.0|Not up to the Vince Flynn standard that I have found in all the other books of his that I have read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy playing this game because it is addictive and I like the matching games.  I have played it for a long time on my computer but the one on my computer is not delux so with this one I can play different games. I would recommend this game to everyone
B0063IH60K|4.0|I sometimes like solitaire.  It is not my favorite game, but I like the way it works and I will definately be playing it more.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to play solitaire.
1451620829|5.0|The people who criticize this book for being too candid and frank are moronic . If Peter played it safe and held back, he would be shredded for wasting people's time and money. Here, he is explosively honest and direct-and still people complain. Life is full of disappointment and tragedy. If Peter reports what happened honestly-which I believe he has--then that's just the way it was. I commend him for baring his soul... warts and all. If many of the people around him back then get blasted, they deserved it. It tops the Frehley and Simmons bio-books by a mile or so and is infinitely more moving and interesting. I knew Peter would deliver when he finally decided to tell his story-and he does. Peter, don't ever be less than truthful to your heart. You are a \\"for real\\" person!
B00846REIS|3.0|Ok read but way too much of an exact carbon copy of 50shades....well-written but I felt like I just read this same book.
0307279189|5.0|I originally listened to this on audible. This book changed my entire outlook on running. The story is spectacular and the digressions into the scientific details of our biologogy and evolution are equally incredible. Must read for all  runners.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book. I think I would have been able to relate to the book more if I had backpacked or hiked more than a day. I was expecting a little more on the nature talk but it was more about her, which was fine. Over all a good book.
0684847248|5.0|A true classic that will never be irrelevant.  Recommend it highly to all who care about making a difference in this world.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|The movie is good and stays true to the comics. The television scenes are dumb and pointless plus they take up most of the movie. Robin sounds really bad, i know she is a girl but she sounds like a little snotty brat. Very good voice for batman and two face, i think batman's voice steals the show. very good movie can't wait for part 2.
B005NFJAMG|5.0|I purchased this Blu Ray DVD (and I have to say I purchase about 90% of my over 200 Blu Ray Collection from Amazon.com), as I usually try to wait for the to go on sale for $9.99 or less and I'm extrmely happy with their packaging and delivery of the Blu Ray DVD's).<br /><br />About the movie, it stars Kurt Russell, with a camio appearance of Steve Segal (he gets killed early in the movie, sad), there are other good actors that you will recognize but maybe not be able to name them, but they do a good job of acting in the movie.<br />The Blu Ray quality is very good and if you were to purchase it (I paid $9.99 for it) I think you would be happy with it.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|I purchased this for my 8 year old who loves the show Austin and Ally, and needless to say we were not disappointed in the purchase! This soundtrack is full of fun, energetic songs from the show as well as a couple from Austin's own group, R5. Definitely a fun CD for fans of the show, highly recommended!
143911000X|4.0|My son is a fan of the TV show &#34;How I met Your Mother&#34;, but he says he would love the book even if he wasn't a fan of the show
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has completely got my wife hooked. Lots of fun and sometime challenging.<br />Keep in mind this is not a twenty dollar game so don't expect one. I love the locks that just drive you nuts.
B000OCXF0Q|3.0|I Bought This CD At Barnes & Noble I Didn't Take Off The Plastic Beacause It Was A Gift To My 8-Year Old Daughter It Was 2:00 P.M And Takes Off The Plastic She Listeins To It And Then She Screams In Terror She Throws The CD Down And Says It's Terrible She Said I HATE Her It Is Horrible!!! I Listein To Sure Is Right
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I loved Florence + The Machine's last album and I love this one. Definitely recommend! Some great songs on this album.
B00973902K|4.0|Cute, catchy song. That's pretty much the only reason I got it. And I had free music credit. So yeah.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|As soon as I discovered Kimbra, I fell in love with her music. She's a great artist and I can't wait to hear more from her! Awesome CD.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Very interesting read. I would suggest reading this book if you enjoy psychology and studies in human behavior. I read it in 3 days and couldn't put it down. I read Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics and Amazon suggested I might like this book. Good job Amazon.
0425263908|5.0|This makes the Fifty Shades look like a children's book! Although there are similarities between the stories, this is a good, hot read!!
0425263916|5.0|I loved this book! Fast read. Hot read. Better than the first in the series! Can't wait for the next one. :)
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook  is fun.  I have been able to get in touch with old friends and family members near and far.  The only thing I am beginning to dislike is some friends never post real comments anymore....just pictures with ecard sayings, etc.  How many Like if you love Jesus and scroll down if you love the devil can you take???  We need a friend rating!  Lol
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|if you are into match 3 games then this is the one for you.  its soothing and simple enough to play.  the music Is nice and the colrs are bright.

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I knew this would be good. He has his own way of singing and adds his own style. I was for him from the start to win American Idol. Kinda had a Joe Cocker  way with his singing. He made every song his own. Just love,love,love this cd. Can't wait for his next one. I am a big fan of his. Proud he did so good with all his health issues that were going on at the time but he did a great job. Wish him much luck and success . Would recommend this to all. you won't be sorry you bought it
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was VERY intriguing I soundly put the book down but there were a couple parts that were confusing and I still don't understand if peers is dead or not a lot of my friends just right out hated this book but I think that it was a good book I will definitely be downloading the next book in the series mokingjay Suzanne Collins is a VERY talented writer and I know for a fact I will read more of her books
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I think it's a great app just the video recorder doesn't work and I don't know how to save the pics from the timer cam
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I think this is way better than cut the rope. It is easier, but not to easy. Great for puzzle lovers and anyone who wants something fun and simple to pass the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could write such an amazing book!!!!!!!!! I just have to read the others due to a cliffhanger and I just can't wait!!!!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is a short book which introduces the topic of publishing a Kindle edition. It doesn't assume much knowledge about Microsoft Word, the preferred authoring program (OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice get a mention, but no detailed instructions). If you have a complex or very large book, however, you'll need other help.
B009CPES4I|5.0|was exactly as i thought - how can you not love judi dench?!  we really enjoyed this movie - left us with in a good mood.
B006LRUVUA|3.0|The file transfer feature is great. But desktop control stutters a lot. Team Viewer is faster and smoother, but doesn't work outside my home network without disabling my firewall. Team Viewer works away from home, even with my firewall up. So it's a trade-off and neither is glitch free. I do like Team Viewer but only use it away from home since it's more reliable. Just wish it snappier with the desktop control. If not for that, hands-down I'd keep it instead of Splashtop. Nice features, like session recording and online interface and account. Free for personal use. Splashtop has an annual fee for the same features.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've loved mahjong since I first saw the game on Windows 3.1.  I grabbed Mahjong Artifacts Free from the Play Store a few months back for my Galaxy S3 and thought it was outstanding and VERY playable on that size screen.  We bought the 9\\" Fire HD for our boys for Christmas and I happened to find the full version of Mahjong Artifacts for free a couple days later.  SO glad I got the full version!  The changing tile sets as you work through the story line adds a bit of challenge, but the ability to play the \\"classic\\" layouts with those tile sets gives you a chance to get used to them.  Endless mode is a true test of stamina, and again, even enjoyable on the small screen of my S3.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what the negative reviews for ads are all about.  If it's the initial screen advertising their other games, even my 3 yr old figured out the \\"play\\" button in a less than a minute.  Beyond that, I haven't seen an ad in the full version of the game.  Maybe G5 has updated it since those reviews were posted?  I'm not sure.  But this may be the best mahjong game you'll find on the Android platform.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I've tried most of the RDC apps out there and Spashtop, by far, has the fastest desktop control interface.  It's pretty much just as fast as sitting at the computer itself and controlling it hands on.  So, for that, I give it 5 stars.  Just wish they had a file transfer feature on this version.  I think they added it to the newest one, but that one requires a yearly subscription fee, and I'm just not interested.  I used TeamViewer for file transfers, and Splashtop for just basic desktop control of other computers.  It works really well at home, but once I leave my network, Splashtop is really spotty unless I turn my firewall off before leaving home.  I don't like leaving my computers exposed like that, so I only use Spalshtop at home.  It's certainly not perfect, and the subscription app prolly resolves some of these issues, but I just don't think it merits the subscription fee.  I'll stick with  this and TeamViewer.  At least that combo works for me and costs nothing.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Dove right in and got hooked - another great book by Ken Follett - want to read first in case this one is also a movie.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|These are my favorite movies of all time!!!!  The HD stream off of Amazon instant video is equal to blue ray quality with a good internet connection and quality tv.  Recommend highly.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Was a little skeptical about Neeson's kick-ass-ness but he pulled it of. Storyline was mostly believable. Will be watching the sequel for sure.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This is my favorite movie and Today it still is my favorite movie<br />The widescreen was great and I'll buy some more DVDs soon
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|I've been playing this for two days straight and I haven't done that with any CD for a long time.  Can't decide what track is my favorite but I may be partial to Cocaine and Gin.  This is my first Kid Rock CD and now I need to get the others.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very awesome game and I love how it get even harder after the easiest ones. love it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks doesn't let me down.  I find myself reading his books and falling more in love with my wife. His books make me want to be a better husband.
B0063M22QO|1.0|I AM UNABLE TO GET TO THE OTHER GAMES AS IT SAYS TO COMPLETE FIRST TOWER. I DID.....BUT IT WILL NOT UNLOCK FOR ME TO GET THE BEST OF ALL.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It makes him think but isn't too difficult. I even get into it myself lol. Nice game to entertain kids.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The price is 6.99 and it is not over price. The game is so fun!!!!!!!! Never ask to rate it or buy something which make it better than most already. This game is just like any pocket edition but better with the newest update!!!!!!!!&lt;3!!!!!!!!&lt;3!!!!!!!!!&lt;3!!!!!!!!&lt;3!!!!!!!!&lt;3!!!!!!!!&lt;3!!!!!!!!&lt;3!!!!!!!!&lt;3
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It met my expectations and is working well. I would recommend purchasing the case to other people.  The price was right.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After watching the movie, it was nice to read the book and get more of the backstory. Can't wait to read Catching Fire.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I have been watching series here in Australia-always anxious for the next weekly episode-series has just ended until next year here<br />I bought this series for my family who work when weekly show is on=to good a show not to watch!<br />excellent show
B009B0L324|5.0|Not necessarily a fan of live CDs/albums but for fans of the band AC/DC this is a must have !  Some bands are recording artists, pure and simple. This CD proves that AC/DC have been and always will be, live rock legends !<br />Rock on, Skip Wieland
B00005JM1F|5.0|This is one of my old time favorite movies. My old copy was stolen. It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and excellent quality
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I purchased this CD as a followup to reading the three Fifty Shades novels.  Let's just say my wife and I enjoyed reading the books and the music enhances any &#34;literary benefits&#34; we are enjoying !  Great music to listen to while reading or whatever ! :-) Skip and Peg
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I have to keep spending money if I want to keep playing.  It took less than 15 min. to reach the point where I would have to spend more money, for example, the third circle requires an additional 1.99 + tax. I feel this should have been made clear before the original purchase of $2.99 + tax.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I like Kid Rock music, but I didn't buy this CD for me, I bought it as a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it !<br />As you read this, my son has this CD cranked up as loud as possible in the bathroom.  He's happy, so am I, thanks, Amazon !  A big fan, Skip !
B007GFDVEE|5.0|My son has gotten into loving legoes, I saw this pack and knew it was perfect.  there is the capt. his bike and the gun is almost bigger then the little man but it is great.
B008G59IKO|5.0|We all take turns with the Green Day CD, Dos, my son in the bathroom, my wife on the treadmill and myself in my office. Sure we could each have our own but we simply trade.  Seriously, we bought all three CDs by Green Day, thanks to Amazon and we share all three with one another.  Is it good music ? Yes, crossing gender as well as generation gaps in our family. We are having a happy musical new year, thanks to Amazon !<br />Skip Wieland, a devoted Amazon fan, as if you couldn't tell !
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I just love everything they write.  This is my favorite series.  I wait for it every year. They're amazing writers and storytellers
034580404X|5.0|Originally, I bought these books on a whim, to see what all the hoopla was about, almost as a joke.  But now I am a  Fifty Shades fan !  After I read all three books, I gave them to my wife to read and &#34;critique&#34;. She, a fan of Romantic novels, became a Fifty Shades fan also.  Although, not in the literary category of Lady Chatterly's Lover, author E L James has truly found a literary niche.  Subsequently, we bought the Fifty Shades CD and the Fifty Shades Chicken cookbook and are enjoying those products immensely, also. A gentleman never tells but the books are being enjoyed by my wife and I, on many levels beyond their literary benefits!  All we can say is, Enjoy !<br />Skip and Peg :-), :-)
1449415881|5.0|This is a great gift for anyone that likes Dilbert. I get this for one of my family members each year, and he loves to keep it on his desk at work.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Purchased a Used complete first season and it was great, DVD's in great condition and I was able to enjoy the whole first season for minimal cost!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Super funny this movie is so funny it is funny and therefore you should watch it and have fun times laughing with your friends and or family
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this triology!!!!  This author is brilliant and her writing is beyond captivating :)  I would recommend these books to everyone.
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|Terrible movie. No plot. A complete waste of my money. Who the hell came up with the idea to make this movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Never a dull moment in this newest Mitch Rap novel. I have read all and believe this one to be the best. Well written and well presented in this suspenseful story. I am sorry it's over, can't wait for the next one!!!!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|The hype seemed to be to much for the movie to live up to, it did. Was better than what people said.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my &#34;go-to&#34; movie when there's nothing on television. I love all the character representations in this version. You won't be disappointed.
B005LAII12|5.0|Got here the day after Christmas but considering I only ordered it two days before I could not be happier
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Love this movie from watching it on cable when I was a child. My kids have learned to love it too. Good clean fun!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love diary of the wimpy kid books, I read them in 30min.  I think you should read these books! :)<br />Nana (female) age 10
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Hey any movie with Colin Firth and Hugh Grant has got my vote. Not crazy about Renee, but she does a nice job - I guess.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|well done....decent, family-friendly entertainment...good character development, keeps you interested and waiting for the next episode...hopefully it will be around for a few more seasons...we need more shows like this on TV.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Color or black & white, this is a amazing movie. Any other remakes are pale in comparison, not even worth the time to watch. I'll stick with the original, thank you.
0393338827|4.0|There are many books detailing the fall of the investment banks, and by association the world economy. This is another one of those but it comes at the crisis from a different angle - by looking at the people who, rather than losing their shirt, became rich - in some cases, obscenely rich - from the downfall. In my opinion, deducing how these smart few made their millions is a better way of understanding the whole crisis than concentrating on those that lost everything. Above all, you garner a sort of respect for those guys who had the wherewithal to buck the trend and despite immense pressure from their investors and colleagues were able to have the last laugh.<br />All of Lewis's finance related books are easy to read for someone with no finance background, and although this one gets a little dense when he's explaining credit default swaps, it is by and large very digestible for the layman.
B0017SXHR2|5.0|I saw this on cable, years ago and loved it then. Would like to see a remake that would be as good. I did watch a remake on PBS, but it just didn't impress me. Maybe I just like older film....
0684803356|5.0|Hemingway is one of the best known authors worldwide and with good reason. As someone with limited knowledge of European history and a complete ignorance of the events of the Spanish Civil War, this had me engrossed and wanting to learn more. It had me so engrossed that I nearly wanted to go join a rebel movement and dedicate myself to war a la Robert Jordan.<br />This book has the vital ingredients of sex and war and mixed together with Hemingway's unbelievably creative writing style, makes for one of the best works of fiction of all time.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Whenever there's nothing on the tellie, I just pop this in and I've got hours of entertainment. The more I watch it, the more I like it.
0316010669|3.0|Gladwell's other books 'The Tipping Point' and 'Outliers' both were great to read and had some really interesting, important insights. 'Blink' is likewise, a great read but not with quite the same validity in the insights. Cognitive science is a deep and little understood domain so it is perhaps a little beyond a journalist such as Gladwell to be making any groundbreaking claims.<br />But what he does do well, without fail, is provide interesting examples and find insights that a mere mortal would never even consider. He is at the very least, thought-provoking, and what more could you ask of a book than to make you really THINK about things?
B008QTVNUI|4.0|We watched all 13 episodes in 2 days.  The video was erratic at times, but we got through it.  Recommend it for Homeland fans
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Although this book cops some knocks from the strictly academic-intellectual types, it is far (very far) from being a squishy, new-age self help book typical of that part of the bookstore. Gladwell delves into several stories and dissects perhaps the most interesting and most difficult to see explanations from them. The opening chapter about the corellation between date of birth and ice hockey prowess is excellent. Other examples are used to show that there is much more to success than just pure hard work. Sure, hard work is a prerequisite, but by itself will only bring you to mediocrity. The other vital ingredients include where and when you were born, social connections, opportunities you are offered (and are able to take), but above all, a healthy element of LUCK!
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought this book was great. I chose to read this book because I was one of millions who was captured by the character of Christian Grey. I noticed many similarities between the two books but they were both great and I am looking forward to continuing to read the series.
B0053O89IS|4.0|We love the series so, we knew these would, again be terrific. We were hoping for a few more stories in the season.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I found this book to be Funny and entertaining! Similar to the movie What Happens In Vegas. Would recommend  if your looking for a nice romantic comedy.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I absolutely could not put this book down. It was funny romantic and heartbreaking. Thank you for the story. I will always remember Hope
B005COO1X6|4.0|I wanted it to be longer!  I miss being totally consumed by one of Stephen King 's books for days instead of a couple of hours.  Still, truly one of the best storytellers out there.
1401924352|5.0|I am a huge fan of Miranda Kerr as a model but now, after reading her book, I am a fan of her as a person! The book is very inspirational and made me feel good about life in general! I suggest this book for anyone!
1419707663|4.0|This series of books is great.  They are all great reads. My grandson and daughter love them.  Would reccomendto anyone.
1451695195|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone of any religious belief!  I would especially recommend it to athiests---might make you reconsider!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was so thrilled to find this boxed set.  It is a great price for all the movies.  It comes in a cool case to hold all the movies.  My son was thrilled to receive this at christmas.  I would recommend it.
0446573019|4.0|I always enjoy Baldacci's books. This is another very good read. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is amazing I didn't think it was going to be good but it's a fun challenging game for all ages
B007HACDLK|3.0|Always like Mitch Rapp, tho this one a bit formulaic with rather difficult premise and an ending that proved to be un-climactic.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I fell in love with this book from page one. I couldn't put it down nor did I want it to end. I think it would be amazing if Jamie continued the story.
B008602KQI|4.0|I read the trilogy before seeing this movie.  Although I really liked the movie I would have loved it if it were longer or in 2 parts to fit in more from the books! Excited for the next one!
0345529057|5.0|these are the best books i have ever read! one of the best stories i have ever herd and read. huge story line always twisting and turning keeps you turning pages and yearning for the next chapter
1476712042|5.0|Once I started this book I could not put it down! I finished it within 2 days! Awesome storyline that you can actually relate to.. kinda bummed with the ending but only because I wanted it to go on :) Can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out!
B0034G4P94|5.0|Emotional, kind of transparent story line but i still get choked up at a few parts. heart tugging action packed fight themed film. well done great camera work and very realistic fight scenes. i enjoyed it very much
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a beautifully written novel, I absolutely loved it. At times very funny, and heartbreaking sad, the characters altogether \\"real\\".
0553801473|5.0|warning, this is the latest of the Fire and Ice series! the story IS NOT OVER but if you read this you will be like me, stuck and waiting patiently as possible like a kid at a carnival waiting on a ride, first in line. its so hard but there is nothing you can do about it. amazing series, one of the best stories ever told
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This is a wonderful item, but it took me a while to get through it, but it's a great product.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|This is a very good dvd, sound is good video is good and obviously you can't see the Bee Gees anymore live, so I would say this is the next best thing
B00322PK2G|5.0|I am delighted with this watch.  It is exactly what I wanted.  Something simple for playing tennis and doing sport.
B008966SLM|5.0|Excellent,I love Robert Cray, even though this is live it is still a good cd, with a great sound quality
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A quick read. Refreshing after reading intense books. A very well written book about young inexperienced love moving too fast.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|This set started out very expensive......my 10 year old loved it though.  Personally, I would like to see more of a Christmas theme even with the Star Wars set - it is an Advent calendar after all.  Would also like to not see all the things inside pictured on the box as that ruins any kind of surprise.  And I would also like to not see the scary guy (sorry, not a big Star Wars person, so don't know the name) in the upper right hand corner......that really turned me off thinking I was buying an advent calendar.......I would love to see Lego come out with some less expensive advent calendars and with more holiday &#34;stuff&#34;...........
B00275EGWY|5.0|While some will say this movie does not accurately describe military life in action, I will say it does have the drama and action only Hollywood can produce...but, as other reviews state this is ENTERTAINMENT, not a documentary, with that being said, it is a movie which grips you and keeps your attention. (Btw, I have family in military and law enforcement).<br /><br />Makes for a good movie night.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|As a fifty something, it was a bit hard to relate.  I liked the characters.  I liked Charlie.  Unfortunately, don't think I would have had the courage to be his friend when I was in high school.
B00007AJGH|4.0|I first bought this film when it came out on VHS. I hadn't seen it in many years.Wish it was out in Blue-ray.A fun film on a rainy day! It got here quick. Keeps little children still!!! Thanks,Buck
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Worst of them all. Dramatic background music to nothing or I should say to a lot of talking. Not much action until the end and then it was to late. I could care less. Just a washed up Bruce Wayne. What happened to the original batman feel. For example the penguin and all his gadgets. The batmobile and all of the fun of what batman is, is gone.
B005USZYDU|1.0|I over paid for this book. While the story was good the price should have reflected it shortness. I think publishers overcharge for electronic books.
B0041O40EI|5.0|This puzzle took us a while to put to gether, but it was worth it.  We learned many things about London.  We looked up each building on wikipedia as we installed them.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Although not as good as the original the action was well done. I do think reusing and intertwining the previous movies footage in this one sort of lessened the impact ( you really had to understand and keep up with the plot in the previous movies).This one did not meet the intellectual standards set before.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|...maybe it's the cynic in me, but pls tell me I'm not the only one who thinks his reported &#34;achievements&#34;, be it weightlifting or other crazyman gym-pumping etcetc, is ridonkly inflated?! o.O<br /><br />Otherwise, very informative read, hv no probs owning an e-copy :) xx<br /><br />xx
B000FBJF7I|3.0|I chose this rating because of the ease of reading.  The intertwined mysteries and relevant history and references to culture by Mr. Smith develops a great book.  I also liked some vocabulary challenge.  Christian character lessons are excellent.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I gave this to my newborn nephew since his mom was always losing his pacifier, now its always there to be found
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing. I loved it and I would read it a billion more times it was simply amazing and heartwarming. Great book
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very funny. Fat Amy steals every scene. Able to watch with my tween, which is very unusual these days. The plot is predictable, but the movie moves along at a good pace.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|Love this CD, she is just great and all her music is always great too, look forward to many more.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|I Love the big bang theory.Kaley's so hot . laugh at every episode .so awesome . blu ray's the best.enjoy
1400079144|5.0|As a practicing Mason, I found this book to be very intriging.  It held my attention from the beginning to the end.<br />I did not expect the ending as presented.  Very clever.  Much enjoyed.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I loved the entire book. Read it cover to cover in one night. Paulo Coelho has created an amazingly inspiring story... Definitely would recommend others to read it.
B002JMLMKE|5.0|this book held my attention from beginning to end.  Very suspenseful and complements the movie very well.  Or should I say the movie did a great job sticking to the story of the book..
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I enjoyed both cd's and dvd. I have already recommended cd. I am a huge fan of Nicki Minaj. Much success N.M.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I couldn't stop reading.  Loved the way it went forwards and backwards.  I was able to keep up with the story.  It brought me to tears.  I thought the ending was plausible.  I couldn't just skip to the end to see what happens.  I had to read the whole story not to miss anything.  It was a very enjoyable way to spend a week off.  Loved that it was long!
B006SV2LWA|3.0|As a movie I did like it, and I thought it was exciting enough to be entertaining.  That said, it is quite accurate and my microbiology professor, who has also toured the CDC, loved this film.  So while it is a good movie it also manages to stick to the facts, which can e difficult to do in a thriller.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I am only rating it a four because I just wanted to keep on reading it.  I had lost 40 pounds.  Then this winter I regained ten. What happened?  I see now where I let thinking into the equation.  I didn't have a backup habit for when it rained.  Once I had to start thinking about whether to go out in the rain, my habit of exercise changed, which spilled over to diet and everything else.  I am now confidant that I will soon be back into my habit of exercise first thing in the morning, my diet will improve, and work reports I need to do will get done.  This  book is not about any of those things.  It's about how we acquired our habits, how to change them, and how powerful they are.  We succeed or lose in life because of our habits.  The book didn't need to be longer.  It's really not that complicated or hard.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|One of the weaker films I have seen from Pixar, although still better than Cars.  That said, a weak film from Pixar is still a higher quality than most films.  The setting of the  film was wonderful, a good backdrop for the friction between selfish Merida and Her proper mother.  A simple story, beautifully told, can be very powerful.  And indeed , it is, even if we never quite see Merida's strength.  We can see her bravery, because bravery is not always about adventurousness, but sing the courage to admit you are wrong and to try and change to become a better person.  That is real courage, because it can be more difficult that courage in the face of physical danger.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I completely loved this book series. I am so sad that there is not another book to read. I feel like I did when the twilight saga was completed. This book had so much drama and suspense. I was on edge with the whole Ana and Jack Hyde situation and would Christian every come to terms with their impending pregnancy. I loved the fact that the author revisited a piece of Christian's  life at the end and let us readers in as to what he was exactly thinking when he first met Ana. It's amazing how when you met the right person they can change your life in ways you didn't see possible. Ana changed Christian for the better and it was amazing to see how the story would pan out.
B0038P59A0|3.0|It has its problems, and sometimes it strays a little too far from the source material.  But it is also tosses fans some nods, such as the bullet holes in the walls, the bulldog (Watson mentions owning one in a novel,mbur never mentions it again).  While Sherlock is rude and a strong fighter, the sort of antithesis to Basil Rathbones character, he is actually much closer to the spirit of the literary Holmes.<br /><br />My litmus test is Watson.  If he is useless and weak, then the film is probably not close to the story.  In this version, Watson can hold his own.  The films has it's moments where I wonder what the point of it all is, the action scenes can sometime drag, but in the end it all comes together and in the end I was entertained.  What more can a viewer ask?
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult is once again able to captivate readers in a way that has them burning through each and every page as if they are being pulled magnetically. Absolutely an amazing novel.
1449410243|5.0|This was a gift for a female relative who has a &#34;devil&#34; cat.  She absolutely loved this book and everyone had a fun time reading the captions in it.
B008S80P38|4.0|I had this on my wishlist and was excited when I got it for christmas.  I immediately put it in my cd player, but was surprised.  I had already heard Channel 42(with Wolfgang Gartner) on my pandora station and was expecting more or less the same from the rest of the album.  It isn't.  I don't think the music flows into each other as smootly as pervious ablums like 4x4=12. And it is a lot more slower paced music I think.  But there are some really good songs on here.  The Veldt (feat. Chris James), Channel 42, Sleepless, and Telemiscommunications (feat Imogen Heap) are some of my top picks for the album.  The absolute worst thing on this album is Failbait.  Piece of junk that is.<br /><br />Overall it's still enjoyable and something a little different.  Any Deadmau5 fan should want to get this or would enjoy receiving this as a gift.
B008RXYOKY|1.0|They sent me the wrong product! it was not what the website shows. I would make sure that you know what you are ordering.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought the story was wonderful with many ideas suggested that are worth considering. The parallel stories were a pleasant surprise. Reading the book before seeing the movie seems a must, for the movie cannot present the whole story. I have read the book twice, and the second reading was as revealing as the first.
0375869026|5.0|Good service, good price, would order again from vendor, gift for Christmas for Grandaughter, I'm sure she will enjoy it
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very well written.  Good story.  Author showed knowledge of dogs and racing.  Made me believe he really knew what the dog was thinking.
1419705849|5.0|Good service, good price, this is a gift for christmas for my grandson, I'm sure he will enjoy reading it
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|Loreena has the voice of an angle.  I know, everyone says that.  But I am moved - get tingles and have to remember to breathe - every time I listen - and I listen to her a lot.  I am especially drawn to the songs with the Mediterranean influence, so &#34;An Ancient Muse&#34; is a no-brainer-purchase for me.  Add the especially diverse and talented musicians who join her, and you have, simply put, magic.  Every song is beautiful and tells a story with a mesmerizing beat, and takes me away to another time, another place, on the wings of this angel.  If you like &#34;eclectic Celtic,&#34; you must have this CD.  But be warned, once you listen to this one, you'll want all her other CD's!<br /><br /> P.S:  If you have any problem understanding the words as he sings them, and it's as important to you as it is to me - I am deaf in one ear so I try harder, I think, than those with stereo ears, to hear every nuance of musical arrangements - invest in her DVD, &#34;Live at the Alhambra.&#34;  Thank you, Loreena, for sharing your musical art with us!
141970642X|4.0|This was purchased for my 9 yr old, who really likes the series and has read all the books. He is happy with the book, and overall I'm pleased with the purchase.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|From reading the reviews I had high expectations for this book, which weren't fulfilled. Not a terrible book, as I read the entire thing, but not as great as I had hoped.
B009IF82SK|5.0|They just keep getting better and better!  I frigging love how the characters interact.  Can't wait to see what happens next.  Will \\"Shamy\\" get physical?
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am impressd and am going to purchase more Bosch novels.  The detail is right on.  He cuts the LT no slack as it should be in this case.
B0058SNKM4|5.0|Muy a gusto con los zapatos. No tengo ningún tipo de quejas al respecto. Buena atención, entrega puntual y calidad del producto. Recibí lo que compré (es decir, no fue un fiasco)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey fans already know how excellent this series is. If you haven't already watched it, I highly recommend it.
B009LA3RJ6|4.0|I bought \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" the moment \\"Just a Girl\\" showed up on MTV. Gwen's vocals and the tightness of the band really blew me away, which caused me to listen to it over and over in 1995. \\"Push and Shove\\" is a good album - not a great album- but worthy to listen to. If anything it shows how far the band has come when making an album. \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" was simple in its production and musicality. \\"Push and Shove\\" is lush in sound and shows many musical genres that need multiple production styles. I can understand the negative or critical reviews of the album since it tends to lean toward following the current music trends (if there are any) instead of sticking to their musical roots of ska, reggae, and rock. Bottom line, the band still plays well together and it is an enjoyable record to listen to.
1439153663|5.0|I read this book for my book club and found I couldn't put it down.As a 65+ white woman, I would be interested, to read some reviews by African American people who may view it differently. I found it moving and enlighening....similar to The Help.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Cannot wait to start reading the next one in the series! Discovered this author by accident and very glad that I did. Started out a little slow for me but quickly got absorbed in the story. Well worth the read.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|It helped me to understand myself better in ways I can’t explain. I am extremely introverted and a shy guy. Now I know why I react so highly to anyone and anything new. Like most introverts, jumping in the deep end of the water and learning to swim is not my thing. I like to sit and and read and think and observe people. Talking is very hard for me to do.  I imagine its the same for all introverts to a varying degree. The author mentions that in America, every 1 in 2 people is an introvert, I completely agree. However, I strongly believe, it's the same the world over.<br /><br />I am an Indian living in a western world. Classic East meets west scenario. There are examples in the book about how new immigrants from the east feel when they first come to the west. I too feel the same. The cultural differences take a while to get used to. Although it's not to say that all people from the east are the same, It's hard for us to express our self with the same ease as most people here in the west do. They talk with such an ease it's great to watch and listen to them but we just can't do it with the same ease. We can do it with our own people but hard to do it with westerners. But if we need to grow in their world, we need to adapt. And coupled with my introversion and shyness,lol, it’s even even harder than I thought. But I am trying.<br /><br />There are lot’s of other very useful things I have learned from the book. I am sure everyone who reads the book will too. Especially when we are surrounded by introverts. They standout easily in a crowd as they are the silent one’s, the people who are observing more than they are talking. Extroverts think that there is something wrong with them since they are not talking much. They just react highly to new people and new situations. They are a bit shy and slow to open up. If you find anyone in your circle or anyone new who is like that, don’t afraid to pull them into the group and have them involved in the conversation. They will like it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a great book and I could not stop reading this book and it is such a heart warming read
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The characters were well-written and engaging, and there's plenty of action, even in such a confined place as an underground post-apocalyptic bunker. I just kept turning pages, and it was over all to soon.
B009329Y30|5.0|I love & read all of Nicholas Sparks books and I go to all the movies that are based on his books.  I am never disappointed.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Bought this case for my wife for Christmas for her new Kindle Fire HD. It's very nice. She likes how well it holds and protects the Kindle. And its made well that it's going to last for a long time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|an easier to read battery status than the one that comes installed.  It was easy to down load and easy to install.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is the first mahjong game I've played since the 486 dx2 days, and I much prefer the touchscreen interface. Graphics are very nice on my tablet, and the quest mode gives the player a story to follow as the tile themes change with the ancient civilization being explored. 5 stars!
1939416019|3.0|So many raving reviews I had to write something.  This is not Tolkien or Rawlings or Martin level work.  The overall theme will catch you if you like this sort of story and it did me.  I'm interested to see the overall or develop.<br /><br />It's the details that rate 3 stars.  Personally, I get annoyed by generic names.  We have Thor, the McCloud clan.  Yeah for Norse Mythology and Highlander.  You're not going to have an epic using common epic names.<br /><br />Next up, everything is just too unrealistic.  Common boy repeatedly being in the key spot by complete chance.  The breaking into the Legion training.  Stopping the knife throw.  The arrow.  The wine, etc.  I mean its like Harry Potter thwarting Voldemort several times in the first book.  Also, the end scene is ridiculous for several reasons.  Really?  He left with the knight for the whole day,never mentioning the issue; never talked to Reese?  That's how you treat someone you've publicly proclaimed as family?  I realize there is drinking and rudeness involved, but come on...  And the cliffhanger ending.  Not typical for a series.  Reminds me more of a play where the next act will fall in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />So, in the end my intention is not to chastise the author for writing the book, but more so some of the reviews, especially the official ones. Hoping the author will put some more time and thought into how to connect the dots in the scenes.  It will make for better books.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Call me crazy, this is one of our family Christmas &#34;must watch&#34; movies. Every man has a bad day - Yippee Ka Yay!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|only goes back 45 minutes worthof updates. how can this happen? Makes me wanna go back to myspace. fix it quickly
B004U8VWLE|4.0|I had seen the movie a few times before. What I would suggest is to read a synopsis online about it first, about it meaning and about all the symbolism behind the scence even if the website has a spoiler alert read it. Then u will understand and apprieciate the meaning behind fame and glory in the sence that its not necessarily the artist alone that can destroy themselves but how other are know contributors to there downfall. However with out reading up about it initially you would not get this from the movie so I think that the director ir whoever didnt depict its measn in a movie well enough to get it the first time has nothing to do with being intelectual.
0446572993|5.0|Process and quality of product very good. I reiceved exactly what I expected. Would recommand to anyone.<br /><br />Thank you very much.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|It was very worth it. It had almost the entire game for free, with over 130 free levels. the ads are kind of annoying, though.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I liked this book because of the good examples of habits and how people got caught in them. I would have liked a little more explanation of changing and forming habits but it was a well written book anyway.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got this book because I had started the series but not finished it, and since I loved the first book I figured to go ahead and finish them. This book is amazing, I couldn't put it down. It draws your attention with ever aspect of the hunger games world. LOVE IT. Definitely going to read the next.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful.  Absolutely wonderful.  Made me physically feel claustrophobic at one point.  The character development is amazing with the courage of George Martin (if you know what I mean).  Kept me guessing around every corner.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I had higher expectations for this. But it may just be that I'm not a hug  fan of diary style books.
B007THA4FI|2.0|She can write a book thats not fantasy!  Too bad it was depressing and made me feel like a piece of crap.  Everyone knows life sucks and isn't fair but...  Life was so much better when we were fighting for good and when Voldemort was involved.  What!?!?! Life is better with Voldemort?  Yes! This book made me want Voldemort back.  At least he just outright killed children.  Ugh.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|It was a very creative story, enjoyed it very much!<br />I gave this book five stars because it was so entertaining, putting all of the pieces together.<br />I recommend this book to any  one who loves a mind-bobbling story!
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I remember watching them as a kid and I consider these movies more of horror fantasy movies than anything.  Definitely worth buying in the blu ray box set. Fo' sho'.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I liked the story overall. It got a bit gory, especially at the  end when Pi is telling the story without the animals. The first hundred or so pages offer interesting perspectives concerning the story without the  animals. Overall, it made for a good book. Can't wait  to see the movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The best batman movies ever made - hands down.  The blue ray box set gets it all - content, quality, and a little extra.  Comes with a little book thats nice but these movies sell themselves.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|This cd is a step up for Aerosmith, since their las work of original material, this work sounds like their work in the late 80s, which I love. If they keep up in this line of work, I'm sure we'll get a greater album next time around.<br />LOVED THIS CD!!!!
B009K916ZK|5.0|So far it's really been a good piece of equipment.  It allows me to connect my computer to another monitor so I can have dual screen at work.  Everyone is super jealous and I look like a pro at computers.
B004Z9B9SE|5.0|This collection of live songs is great and since its their first live cd, it makes it better. The dvd is not a concert but just footage from that tour.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is so heart breaking I couldn't imagine going threw this I'm 12 years old almost 13 and I can't believe what she been threw I admire her for not giving up hope and I really hope she's happy and I also hope that phillip and Nancy feel bad for what they have done to a 11 year old girl to a 29 year old women
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the book, it was interesting and kept my attention though out the story.  I would recommend this book today.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|this is a perfect rpg  game with a long play time hours .<br />battle system is like other jrpg games as old final fantasy games<br />but there is a lot of conversations and social life events .
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Breaking Bad is my favorite TV show (maybe of all time) and I always enjoy watching something that is free.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is awesome!! I can keep in touch with family far and near and I get to play some pretty cool games in the process!
B005GSVFF0|5.0|It has all the ingredients of a good movie: humor, romance, action, adventure, music and a moral of the story ending.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I loved him on American Idol and this album is so true to his style.  Every song is a winner.  And for $4, how can you go wrong.  Crazy good songs.  Well done Phillip.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Initially, I didn't want to watch this movie because I thought it would be negative. It is just so cute and silly. You can&#34;t help but love Gru in the end. Unicorns are just so FLUFFY!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not as good as the other Bourne movies. Worn out plot. Not much of a story, just a real long chase.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great movie, one of the most exciting I've seen!  Don't miss this one--it's the best of the Mission Impossibles.  Edge of your seat suspense!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book. My brother gave me my first copy and I just read it to my daughter who loved it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables is a long book, and is not easy to read. Many times I thought about calling it quits, but I stuck with it, and it turned out being one of the best books I have ever read.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|To have such an amazing story as this to also teach you of the inhumanity of some countries is astonishing.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|This movie is intense and contains a scene which is hard to see. Personally I liked the movie and what happens after the scene
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Having the point of view from more than one character in the story was great. It showed the struggles that all the demigods had to face as well as the ones who's point wasn't taken. Rick Riordan also had a vast knowledge of Greek and Roman mythology as he always does and even managed to have a bit of humor and romance mixed in as well. I can't Waite for the next installment.
B000QE1U9K|4.0|Pretty much what I expected.  I just needed to get it to complete my collection.  Thanks to Amozon for always doing a good job on getting the product to where it needs to go.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this kindle fire so much cuz I have so much fun with it. Every time I play on it I can see much more clear and much more bigger than my iPod
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This movie is awesome! It is quite hilarious and is a little bit of a tear jerker. All in all it was a great buy!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great book! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Not much to say.
B004G600A4|5.0|My daughter really enjoys this movie--she is 4 years old. Tangled is her new favorite princess. Great Buy, thank you!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book seriously made me laugh, cry, and smile. I want a relationship just like this. I absolutely loved it.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|It could have been funnier; the crude language and the fake Boston accent really was terrible. I managed to watch the entire movie, reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was pretty amazing. I've never read anything like this . I couldn't put it down . Very well written.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome and i play it a lot. the only thing that could make it better is if half brick would consistently updafe it, like adding more jetpacks and acheivments more often
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would recommend this book to all my friends and to anyone who enjoys a good read. It's easy to follow.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book series . The story is well ended and a lot better than the movies. I would really consider reading all the books<br />. I don't read a lot and these books really caught my interest.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoy reading this book. I did think there were some aspects that could've been better, but I definitely enjoyed the overall plot and storyline.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|when I download a app I don't see it in my kindle fire and that makes me mad I need help or fix this please [[ASIN:B008JGSM6G Flow Free]]
B003ODIZL6|3.0|When you are looking for a certain word you have to know the exact page it is on or flip through all the pages to get to the word.
0374533571|5.0|This was a good read which I thoroughly enjoyed. Stayed up until 3am to finish it. But something puzzled me and I wonder if I missed an explanation in the book. Pat asked Nicki to meet him where he proposed to her but didn't mention the place. How would Tiffany know the exact spot?
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is  rooted in real science. Because of this I was very absorbed into the story. It was very exciting but not over the top. Believable. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in space flight or adventure, or both.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|This movie, GasLand, is filled with half truths and full blown lies. The director even readily admits it on film in the counter film \\"TruthLand\\" which features actual experts in the field commenting on the safety of fracking and the lengths natural gas drillers are going to be safe.    You can watch the movie that tells the real story of a great resource boom that's creating jobs and not harming the environment here:   [...]    I have no affiliation with the movie, but knowing towns in places like Western Pennsylvania that were poor and suffering from massive unemployment and now have some of the lowest unemployment in the country because of opportunities created by fracking for natural gas, I wanted to make sure the other side is shown.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Takes great photos and movies...well worth the $1.99!!!!!  Would recommend this product to everyone.  Better than most digital cameras.  Buy it!!!!
B001FBJTRS|5.0|First, the 2008 vinyl imprint of \\"Cold Fact\\" is fantastic -- Light in the Attic has done an eceptional job of producing a very clean, true recording -- up to our audiophile standards -- read vinyl snobs for over 40 years!<br />The vinyl imprint compares favorably to recent vinyl releases such as Bob Dylan's \\"Tempest\\" as well as some of our Folkways recordings purchased 40 odd years ago. Buy the vinyl without fear if you have the gear!<br />We have been listening (not always together!) to Dylan since the first concert one of us went to in 1964 -- Toronto Canada. PPM since the first concert one of us went to in Pittsfield MA in 1962? and Leonard Cohen since he gave a poetry reading at UWO in what? 1963? We hung out at coffee houses and heard Buffy at the Purple Onion. At first, we spend our scant allowances on vinyl, then when in grad school spent money on records and concerts rather than eat.<br />So, we are at a total loss as to how we missed Sixto Rodrigues. But we found him -- thanks to the flick \\"Searching for Sugarman\\". As other reviewers have stated, if you love the messages bought to you by Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, PPM, even Simon and Garfunkel -- then you are going to get all rebellious when you listen to Rodrigues. The topics of both \\"Cold Fact\\" and \\"Coming From Reality\\" songs will once again, show you both how far our American Society has come -- while going no-where on inner city problems.<br />We love Rodrigues' messages -- from \\"I Wonder\\" (forget how many times have you had sex and listen to the other questions closely!) to \\"A Most Discusting Song\\".<br />Nothing dated about Rodrigues -- except perhaps the \\"angel voices\\" back up on a couple of tracks -- but then even Leonard Cohen had angel voices!
159420411X|5.0|A must read to get over the expert opinions. Many examples of the use and misuse of statistics and polls.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Creationary is my favorite new family game in quite awhile.  I bought it with my 7 year old son in mind and it has proven to be much fun for him and for his parents.  Gameplay is very simple: players take turns building items out of Legos while the other players try to guess what the item is.  If a player's creation is recognized, the builder gets a point and the player who guessed the item correctly gets a point.  First player to 5 points wins.  On his or her turn, a player rolls the dice to determine what category their object falls under: nature, buildings, vehicles, or things.  Then they draw a card, each having pictures of items from those 4 categories, and try to build the corresponding item.  It doesn't get much simpler.<br /><br />Initially my son was a bit intimidated at the prospect of having to build the items without any instructions or help, but he warmed to it quickly.  Parents of younger kids should be prepared to make the game manageable for their children as needed.  If an assigned item seemed too hard for our son, we allowed him to pick another card to try another item.  If he had trouble building the item to his satisfaction, we allowed some verbal clues: is it a living thing?  do we have one of these?  is it a kind of boat?  By combining the Lego-building with a kind of \\"20 Questions\\" vibe, we were able to keep him from getting frustrated and it was still fun for all.<br /><br />One thing that makes this game great is its flexibility.  Players can make up their own alternate rules.  For example, instead of one builder and several guessers, have all but one player build while the remaining player tries to guess the item.  Whichever builder's item sparked a correct guess gets a point.  In addition, we've created our own object cards using index cards with simple hand-drawn illustrations.  The allows us to come up with easier items for younger players and it allows us to extend the game's lifespan by enlarging its library of items.<br /><br />If you're looking for a game that encourages creativity, that's fun for a wide age range, and that's easily expandable, this is a great choice.  About the only downside I can see is that this game might frustrate those who prefer rigid rules.  There are no stated time limits, some of the pictorial item clues are open to interpretation (is it the actual Tower of London or a generic clock tower, for example), and some verbal clues may be needed particularly for younger players.  I think the open-ended nature makes Creationary all the more enjoyable, but others may find it distracting - especially very competitive players who might be more concerned with winning that enjoying the creative heart of the game.  If you like the idea of expressing your creative side through Legos, don't hesitate - get this game!'re looking for a game that encourages creativity, that's fun for a wide age range, and that's easily expandable, this is a great choice.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Like almost everyone else who reviewed this book, I give it five very enthusiastic stars.  It is a truly lovely, heartfelt, heartbreaking and ultimately triumphant and unforgettable story.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a great movie plus I only purchased it for $3. What a great gift for the little ones. Thanks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good read, finished it in two days, couldn't put it down. I liked this one even better than the first one.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I've got a 4.7&#34; Droid, but you can't play this game while zoomed into a portion of the screen. Hence, 'good luck' trying to click the correct tiles when making a match.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is truly a piece of art. The graphics are truly beautiful, the gameplay and level design is amazing, and in addition to all that the game has a very interesting and amusing storyline. I got it for free on Kindles free app of thee day section, but I think it's well worth the $5. Definetly give it a look.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I'm not a fan of reading but the book hooked me in. Now ready to read the other books
B005MMYBXI|5.0|The actual start of the story and how the status quo was obtained.  I do have to say the Romans must have gone to school to learn how to party.  Never a  dull moment.  Plots and subplots were very abundant in the story...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very unusual writing style which captivated me every moment!  The ending is a bit over the top, but still I would highly recommend the book.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|An excellent read, always kept your interest in the plot.  A few things were hokie, but ole Tom keeps you guessing and wondering what is going to happen next.  Very enjoyable...
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Wasn't sure how good this movie would be (sometimes best parts are shown in previews) so I rented it on amazon instant video.  Liked it so much that I purchased it so I could watch it again
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Very good story and if you like action this is the dvd for you....The romans sure had the party thing down to a science.
0486274268|4.0|I love drawing and painting. This book has given me many ideas and help.<br />It has help me draw my beloved puppy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my option for this game is so kids can or mite no what it fells like to be a miner .
055358894X|2.0|I don't understand how this book received such stellar reviews. It is just plain boring from the very first word of the very first chapter. I tried, I really did but if you find yourself skipping entire paragraphs or pages from the fist chapter, well then you already know it sucks. Didn't care about the main character, didn't care about his crew, and ultimately never finished this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun and very addictive coin pushing game. I play this game every hour and everyday. As the description says, it is very addicting
0805095535|5.0|&#34;m a journal writer so after I read this book, I decided to chronicle my own life via the homes I have lived in.  I really enjoyed the journey...both Paul Auster's and my own.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|It's cheaply made and certainly isn't even worth the (low) price.  Wouldn't buy again.  To be fair, it offers some minimal protection but next time I'll spring for a better one.
0375703861|1.0|The characters are artificial, the friendships and relationships contrived and utterly unconvincing , the anachronisms abound and the research is nill. Had Zadie Smith not been an attractive mixed race young woman I doubt this multiculti fairy story would have even been published. However it clearly fitted with the wishful thinking, fanciful imaginings of many of the privileged people in the media and book world expressing how they like to think multiculti London functions, and thus they were blinded to it's amateurishness and tedium.<br /><br />The fact that the author has failed to produce an impressive follow up, is something of an indicator of her lack of real application and talent IMO. I believe she has now quit novel writing entirely, evidence of the old maxim that 'those who can,do, and those who can't, teach', perhaps?
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this movie. Especially if you are like me and can see through the smoke screen of masses, government, and placing limitations on one's self. To me, I have a deep and profound connection to this movie and its meaning. My favorite quotes is from Morpheus: &#34;Don't think you are. Know you are.&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|For me it was forced reading! Dull. Not nearly as interesting as the other two books. I was warned ahead of time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover outdid herself. I read a review about having someone at that was the best non first kiss ever. Well you had me before that. I was truly hooked just with how technology different her life was, but the first time Holder became the night in shinning armor I was already passed in like with him.<br /><br /> I was so wrapped up in Sky's emotions they felt like my own. I felt the happiness, the  excitement, the sorrow, the betrayal, the falling in like, and the falling in love. I felt it all! I normally never get into a book to the point of being the main character, but with Hopeless I did. I found myself trying to figure everything out with the foreshadowing Colleen used, but I was off by a good bit. That made me enjoy the book even more knowing that I didn't know what was coming next.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book of the series!! Keeps you reading late into the night in suspense of his it all ends. Emotional.
0812984412|5.0|I finished this a few months ago and I'm still not sure I have much to add to the avalanche of praise.<br /><br />Yes, I'd call it a masterpiece: brilliantly conceived and executed.<br /><br />If you're a would-be reader, I'd highly recommend starting with an hour-long podcast about this novel on the Slate's Audio Book Club.<br /><br />When the podcast starts, you'll hear the critics encourage you to read the book first.<br /><br />I think this is the exact wrong advice.  Listen to this podcast first and you'll get a better idea of the whole arc of the book and you'll hear some interesting insights about the themes, imagery and underlying concepts.  This will help you get your bearings.  I wish I had listened to it first.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" requires an investment of your time and mental energy.  The payoff is worth it.  The variety of styles and stories is impressive, the language, of course, is stunning.  Beyond that, I doubt I can add anything to the discussion that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />If you had any feelings of unimportance in the sweep of history and billions of people on the planet, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" will give you a lift.  In many ways, it's a big \\"feel good\\" story.<br /><br />I listened to this book on Audio CD and later bought a copy to just see how the words looked on the page.  The performances by Scott Brick, Cassandra Campbell, Kim Mai Guest, Kirby Heyborne, John Lee and Richard Matthews were brilliant.<br /><br />I still can't decide whether to see the movie, but \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a treasure.  I predict it will be read for centuries to come--and that no other writer will dare to mimic its construction.
044024630X|5.0|This book is a must read. Lee Child does it again with another phenomenal Jack Reacher novel that hooks you from the first chapter!

B0036EH3WU|5.0|I'm one of those that has decided to wait and watch it after it stopped airing....well wow.  I starting watching it in March of this year and just finished the last episode tonight.  The last season is a little odd I admit but the final episode had me ruined.  I was bawling the entire time.  Wow great job on bringing back all the people that we loved.  I love love love this series and highly recommend watching it!
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Magnificent book is much more than enlightening for realities sake, but crucial to living a complete & free-thinking life. This book is absolutely necessary to know which is fact & fiction, & what history is truthful.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing a classic and a new all time favorite. Puts life into perspective and hits all the main points of teenage years.
0307277887|5.0|After watching the TV series first, my wife and I decided to read the books.  The books are pretty good, but the series is much better.  More detail, and you get more into the characters.  The books, as is normally the case, would have been better to have been read before watching the series...but, oh well!
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|This book was interesting though, at times overwritten and wordy; the amount of .25 cent words overwhelmed many of the sentences! I also found the description that Black mothers aren't surprised when their kids get in trouble while White mothers are outraged and surprised to be an idiotic comment. This was one of the many racist beliefs within this book.<br />The premise was interesting though, at times, not believable. This book began with so much promise and the ending was powerful but, the middle was sometimes difficult to wade through.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved this book! There were so many relatable situations. The only thing I had wished for was some clue of who Charlie was writing to.. But overall I really enjoyed reading this and hope the movie is as good as the book.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Five stars, The Perks of being wallflower .Great book loved it.  One of the best books I have ever read.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I've had this album for a while and it's had some great usage. A fantastic album and it's great to hear her perform 'Skyscraper' since the one on the album was recorded before treatment. Such a change from her first two albums, it's more pop and dance music. If you're a fan of her previous work i suggest you buy this album! Can't wait for the fourth album!
B004498KPU|3.0|This is a pretty great collection, the case, booklet, and bonus disk are all awesome;<br />However, I definitely have some complaints. I was really looking forward to owning this set because I'm a huge MJ fan, and it claimed to be the definitive video collection. It was not.<br />I was very disappointed that it did not include the complete \\"Ghosts\\" short film, (which also included a dance number for the song '2 Bad' ) instead they slapped together the song with various clips from the movie, and called it a music video.<br />I was also disappointed that it did not include the whole \\"Moonwalker\\" film for \\"Smooth Criminal\\".<br />What downright upset me though was the \\"Black Or White\\" video. It included the extended \\"panther\\" version, which was good, but for some reason, they edited out the most important thing about that video. When it was originally released, it was considered controversial because of the racist graffiti on the windows that Michael detests, and smashes in a fit of rage. But, they edited out the graffiti, so Michael just looks like a jerk smashing up some random person's car for no reason. They included the extended version, but negated the whole point of it. On the plus side, it did have the complete versions of all the rest, including \\"You Rock My World\\" which I was happy about, as well as both versions of \\"They Don't Really Care About Us,\\" a big plus. To truly make your MJ video collection complete, I also recommend owning History Vol. 1 + 2, Moonwalker, and Ghosts separately as well, because sadly, I think this is as complete as it's ever gonna get. That being said, I definitely recommend this set for any MJ fan.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I would rate it 5 stars but the ads in a paid game are annoying. Fine if the first time you start they are there, but after that they should only show as an additional option labeled &quot;More Games&quot;. The tutorial is at most 45 secs to go through. Other than that I like it so far. BTW got it as a free Amazon app. Works very well on my Kindle Fire.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Mr. Palahniuk's writing inspires a look into ones self as to how far one can take themselves into an ideology. Obviously, the main character is an exaggeration of the longing in men today to exhibit manliness, but it is a great analogy to how men desperately try to assert their masculinity through any means, and how men try to find their role in an increasingly sexually clouded world.  Also, I like how the novel may not necessarily be a love story, but rather, a like story. And that may be enough in today's world; just to \\"like\\" someone.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|I'm new to Halo, and know nothing about the franchise. But I am a sci-fi fan. When this movie started I thought it had great potential. The opening was in a surprisingly natural documentary style. The characters were being developed and the story was interesting. As the movie progressed, it was slow at times, somewhat unbelievable at times, maybe a bit simple, but it still kept my attention through most of it.<br /><br />In the last quarter of the movie it turned. It became entirely unbelievable, and it seemed like the producers were trying to integrate the video game, taking it from a sci-fi with realism and some depth through the various characters, to a kind of cartoonish and shallow movie.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much in case you want to see it, but by the very end, I wished I could take back the time it took to watch the movie. I'm guessing that those gamers who know the back story will have a better experience. Also the movie clearly was making way for a sequel, so almost nothing was resolved and there were no answers.<br /><br />For me, it wasn't a movie I could recommend.
B006LSZECO|2.0|When I first began reading this I loved it, especially when I got to the first plot twist.  I didn't see it coming and I love it when an author surprises me.  The problem came after that,  the story became less believable, especially the ending and that ruined the entire reading experience for me.

B006P4FBUE|5.0|Being a musical coach and director of a 100+ Sweet Adelines chorus, it is so helpful to be able to pull up my mini piano to check questionable notes or to get a pitch when no one has a pitchpipe around.

B00280LYIC|4.0|Good read. It is fun to read about the mythology you studied in school. But this is still  book for a young adult.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|This book is a delight from beginning to end.  Animal stories are not my genre of choice and the only reason I read it was because it was the selection for my book club.  The first chapter made me curious, but not overly engaged. Pressing on I discovered a delightful storyteller in Herriot.  He uses his actual experiences as a rural veterinarian in early 20th century Scotland as his source.  He mixes up the personal and incident details in order to preserve his clients' privacy without sacrificing authenticity. The end product is a book I didn't want to put down and was sorry to discover the last page.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|I really don't think that this is a good app.  I couldn't even start. It kicked me out every time I tried to get on.  It looked like a good app.  Please fix the bugs.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent miniseries, especially for women.  Great story lines, great acting, lovely scenery.  I watched all episodes in one week and am looking forward to Season 3.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Love this soundtrack, but was disappointed that it didn't include a couple songs (Fantines' Death, Do You Hear the People Sing, Dawn of Anguish) while they did include some short, unimportant ones and intrumentals.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Whether it's an election year or not, I enjoy books about politics. This is  informative and just gossipy enough to keep one turning pages. It tracks the splits and alliances between former presidents from Hoover to Obama. I am a great admirer of Bill Clinton's abilities to connect with people and was especially interested in his interactions with his predecessors. Spoiler alert: Despite the fact that they share party affiliation, Bill and Jimmy aren't best buds. Indeed, Jimmy Carter emerges as a man easier to admire than like. Clinton seems to avoid Nixon initially but is eventually in  frequent contact with the disgraced ex-president asking him all sorts of nuts and bolts questions and confiding in the older man about his own struggles in office. Ronald Reagan teaches Clinton how to salute. Gerald Ford convinces him he has to come clean about Monica Lewinsky and he and George H.W. Bush become so close that Bush is at his bedside when he wakes up from surgery.<br />  There are also wonderful stories of Harry Truman helping to restore Herbert Hoover's reputation, Eisenhower counseling the young John Kennedy when it appears that Kennedy is in over his head, and Nixon and Johnson trying to stay one step ahead of each other.<br />  Though there were times when these guys drove each other crazy (Jimmy Carter has a special talent in this regard), there is also a reminder that in times of crisis, they were able to put aside partisan considerations for the good of the country. This should be required reading for current members of the House and the Senate).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love this book! It can be a little disturbing at some parts but thats not really til the third book. I have read this book 3 times and that  is not enough. I went to see the movie the first day it came out. I am a total hunger games fanatic!READ THIS BOOK it is my favorite no douts. Of course it is hard for me not to like dystopian fiction novels.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is definitely one of my favorites. The multiple breeding combinations combined with new dragons really give it a great feel. The best part of DragonVale would be the colleseum races. Now you can enjoy the game even more. All in all a marvelous game.
B00APUTEBG|2.0|The plot is trivial and acting is poor. Characters are shallow (even for an &#34;action&#34; movie) and some scenes are really ridiculous and make little sense (the shootout in the garage at the end). I was disappointed and didn't feel great about spending money on a movie like this...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|honestly, I hate to be negative, but guys, this is just a romance novel. not even a terribly good one. please don't take away my girl card. this book tells its readers that love fixes all of our flaws, and all of the flaws of the people we love. the characters have no gravity to their personality or decisions. it's like those wheels you could spin when you were a toddler and it would land on an animal and the toy would make that sound? like that, Ana & Christian have like 7 basic reactions to any situation, they feel them with no particular affinity or relationship to the situation itself, and each of the 7 are rote, trite, prerecorded spiels.<br /><br />for reals, the sex would be hot if I gave a damn about any of the characters<br /><br />=gets off soapbox=
B005LAIHZY|4.0|I really wanted to watch this movie over Christmas but every copy I rented stopped and got stuck in the exact same area in the movie, which was soon after the beginning.

1881273377|5.0|My husband and I listened to this before we got married and feel that every couple should read or listen to this book before marriage.  It is such an eye opener and for couples that have a problem with loving their partner the way they feel they need to be loved, it can teach you so much!!!
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Feynman was a brilliant physicist, but he's also a brilliant observer of the human mind. His puzzlement over the inability of others to see the world as a scientist does helps to explain science in a way that the actual explanation of scientific results might not do.  Entertaining and insightful.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|As I watched this movie, it went from being funny to tired after an hour or so.  I realized that is basically only had one running joke to carry it the whole way, in the manner of 40 Year Old Virgin.<br /><br />I made it just barely through the party scene with Flash Gordon when I realized I was thoroughly bored of the movie and shut it off.<br /><br />If you are into the mindless single-joke comedies, I guess this would be ok for you.  For me, however?  No.<br /><br />The more I think about it, I think having the bear be voiced by Seth's Peter Griffin persona was a big part of the problem.  About half an hour into the movie (or the length of a single Family Guy episode) I realized how much funnier it would have been if someone like Joe Pesci had done the voiceover.  Sadly, we'll probably never know.
B008QTV3X0|2.0|I had heard so many good things about this show, but after watching the first two episodes, I think I'm done.  It's got an &#34;idiot plot&#34; (Siskel and Ebert's old definition of a plot that only moves forward because characters act like idiots), hackneyed dialogue, lots of ugly imagery, and so far, nothing much to recommend it.  If someone can point me to better episodes, I'll give them a try, since I made the mistake of buying the entire first season.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|Bought this one for a Christmas gift. Made a big hit. Now they are collecting his DVD's as well. He is so mesmerizing.
1419367323|5.0|I'd never read any Virginia Woolf, and after listening to this audio version, I'm glad I didn't.  Virginia Leishman's beautiful reading slowed the book down enough that the beauty of the language and the emotion came through in a way that I might now have appreciated if I'd read the book myself.  One of my favorite audiobook experiences of all time. I've now bought additional copies of this for three or four friends.  Highly, highly recommended.  If you aren't a Virginia Woolf fan, it will make you into one.  If you aren't an audio book fan, you will be after listening to this transcendent reading.

1416955070|1.0|City of Bones is about a girl named Clary who, one day, suddenly sees things she shouldn't. This leads her to learn about the Shadowhunters, people who fight demons, and is sucked into this other world that normal people (\\"mundies\\") cannot see. Cue the action, romance, and slew of characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, from the first chapter, City of Bones began with a handful of problems.<br /><br />-x-Writing -x-<br /><br />The writing was the main culprit for why this book fails to be, simply put, a good book. It's mediocre, riddled with descriptions that do nothing to bring the story forward or flesh out a character. It seems to be shoved in just for the sake of sounding pretty or the author fails to grasp when and how descriptions are best utilized. This swells the book to reach it's near 500-page mark. I appreciate a few details to get a grip on the setting, but I don't need a constant step-by-step descriptor of everyone's outfits (unless it pertains to the plot, etc) or a vast amount of information on the random pedestrian standing at the curb. I also don't need to be told five times within one chapter that so and so has golden crowned hair or slit eyes. Once is enough. It doesn't do ANYTHING for your story, and serves to irritate the reader.<br /><br />The book also reads like you're watching a movie, which isn't a good thing. The story begins with dual-POV, of Clary and a suspicious boy whose POV, we learn later, becomes moot and ceases to exist. This is sloppy execution in terms of holding a consistent POV (whether multiple or not) for the reader. It's randomly tossed in (for dramatic effect, it seems), and nothing else.<br /><br />There were also stretches in creativity, rattling me out of the story's flow to wonder where the heck that came from.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />\\"Jace raised his head and smiled. There was something fierce about the gesture, something that reminded Clary of documentaries she'd watched about lions on the Discovery Channel,the way the big cats would raise their heads and sniff the air for prey.\\"<br /><br />One, I don't understand how the gesture is considered fierce given her analogy. The cats raise their heads and sniff for prey and somehow Jace only lifting his head is all it takes to reflect that (he doesn't lift it at all the way a lion does when sniffing)? Also, a lion lifting his head to sniff is more of a casual gesture than a fierce one, so again the point was lost to me. Similarly, the reference is random. Unless Clary is a documentary fanatic or had another quality that was becoming of such a random metaphor, the effect is lost and made silly. This happens a lot, her making random analogies that don't reinforce who she is as a character.<br /><br />Another issue with the writing is the dialogue tags. There's an abundance of adverbs and tags like \\"protested angrily\\", which are considered a no-no for good reason. It's another jarring effect on the reader and yes, we could have figured out she was protesting by the dialogue itself (and/or body language). Pair that with the abuse of similes and you got a recipe for a weakly constructed book.<br /><br />All in all, if the book had only been guilty of a few writing foul ups, and sprinkled throughout, it wouldn't have been such an exhausting read. However, the author has a poor concept of the writing craft, and it shows all too well page after page after page.<br /><br />-x-Characters -x-<br /><br />All of the characters came across as cardboard cut-outs, which I attribute to the poor writing style.<br /><br />Clary is a weak protagonist. She goes along with things too easily, never really revealing a conflict within herself given her circumstances. She's just there to bring the plot to action, a tool rather than a character with a personality and motives. Similarly, the author goes to great lengths to dub her a clumsy, not-beautiful girl, only to have others deem her beautiful and show absolutely none of those clumsy attributes when in battle; instead, she's graceful--where did that come from?<br /><br />I don't need to hear about how flat-chested she is over and over. Browbeating the reader is going to backfire instead of reinforce what you're trying to say. Not to mention when Clary constantly compares herself to a more beautiful character, it becomes trite and lowers her appeal as a character (if she had any to begin with).<br /><br />Another issue were details about characters--again, randomly inserted. It seemed that the author wanted to sprinkle in references to manga (even including the word \\"otaku\\") and how it is somehow part of Clary's life (which it really isn't actually so...?), which I found in poor taste. These things are mentioned in passing and thrown in randomly, like the author was trying to let you know that she knows about those interests when it does absolutely nothing for Clara's character.<br /><br />It makes me cringe when things like that are thrown in just for the sake of throwing it in. This also goes for other qualities of Clary. Supposedly she likes to read and draws/paints, but we don't get that information until much later. While I don't believe you have to info dump about characters early on, there should be mentioning of important aspects of their character so the reader has at least a hint of what kind of person they are. We get essentially nothing about Clary in the beginning, other than she is a girl with a best friend named Simon.<br /><br />I didn't like Jace either. I don't have a problem with a cocky character, but he didn't have much depth. What attempt at depth was there felt too pushed, a bit forced, and I just couldn't find sympathy to give him. His story about a falcon and how it serves as an allegory to love is overreaching; overreaching happens quite a bit in this book in general so prepare for that. Also, his sarcastic comebacks become stale fast and the author drives the point home that he's gorgeous. Sarcastic, won't-ever-love kind of guy whois gorgeous? Meh. Nothing special here. The romance between Clary and him is dull too, possibly due to the fact I didn't care a lick about either of them, especially Clary who had no distinct characteristics of her own.<br /><br />In chapter one, Jace drops his knife, startled by Clary appearing during their interrogation. He's supposed to be a hunter, the best of his age group, so I can't fathom how he would whirl around like a frightened doe and drop his weapon. Instead, I had expected him to be on his toes, knife clutched tighter and aiming for the source of the sound. That hiccup, I found out, is a precursor to other personality continuity issues, which the book is plagued with.<br /><br />I felt similarly about Simon and the other characters. Simon seems to exist to set in motion the ingredients for a love triangle. A strange one that I didn't grasp. Clary's feelings toward him liking another girl were overly dramatic and I just tried to ignore it after the halfway point. I didn't care. It wasn't doing anything for their character development really. It was silly and not believable.<br /><br />I was curious about Alec, but he ultimately has no development of his own either, which was a shame given my interest in him. Magnus could have been a fun character, but the terrible dialogue, which is not funny as many claim it to be (it's forced and stereotypical), makes him unable to shine. Hodge was another character I was interested in and he had the most potential in terms of being the strongest character. However, like I've said, the writing is so poorly done that he isn't able to keep his head above water and become a vibrant character.<br /><br />And the bad guy. Well, nothing special here. He hates another race of creatures for the sake of hating. Nothing imaginative about him, no other qualities that would make him a great bad guy. He's just the bad guy because...there had to be a bad guy.<br /><br />I also thought it was odd how characters were introduced, their name tagged in a sentence by someone else to reveal the other character(s) in the scene. Once or twice I can forgive but it occurred so often that it seemed like a blatant device used to introduce characters--a weak device at that since that isn't how people generally speak so it throws the flow off.<br /><br />-x-Plot -x-<br /><br />Plot wise, the big `surprises' were seen coming miles away and I wondered how Clary could be so dumb she couldn't pick up on some of them. While I like foreshadowing and getting hints to the climax/surprises, there was none of that here. Somehow, the obvious was a constant presence in the story, which I found startling given the lack of foreshadowing or any other technique that would have normally suggested at it.<br /><br />I will say, however, that the book doesn't drag on in terms of action. There's always something going on, places to go. It's the bad writing that makes it tiring to read about. I don't know if the constant pace of something going on is a good or bad thing, however. I'd like to think it's a good thing, if nothing else.<br /><br />All in all, I felt like I was reading a story where the author put herself as the main character and stripped away any appeal with mediocre writing, weak character development, and a desperate need for editing.<br /><br />Readers who have no appreciation for the craft of writing and are looking for a relatively fast-paced story would like this book. I can understand why many have read it, liking the idea of Shadowhunters and their world (I did too), but I find it insulting that writing and characterization can be left in the dust as a result. Hence, why I felt the need to point out a handful of the things that bugged me that people either forgave or altogether overlooked.<br /><br />Readability: Never again.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|The graphics are excellent. Game play is just difficult enough to make the game challenging without making it frustrating. The map and notebook features allow one to play the game without having to take notes on paper which can be lost. The hint system provides complete solutions to questions so be forewarned, they are spoilers.  I used the hints a couple of times. I am a big admirer of Tesla so buying this game was a no brain er, it was destined. This is a winner, buy it.

B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I liked the idea of this movie.  I really enjoy against all odds stories of wilderness survival.  Maybe I didn't like this movie because I've read so many non-fiction books on this subject, and this is more like a unrealistic horror movie.  Honestly, if you were trapped in the Alaskan wilderness the last thing you'd be worried about is wolves.  The movie makes it seem like it would basically be a walk in the park if not for the super smart wolves that always seems to be in the right place.  Little to no talk of freezing to death, starving, physical exhaustion, frostbite, etc.  Some of the guys are wearing baseball caps or no hats at all, and seem to be doing just fine except for the wolves.  At least they talked about elevation sickness for a moment, and then the guy died.  I understand that using the wolf as the villain helps sell tickets, and I don't have a problem with a movie exaggerating certain things for entertainment value, but I felt like they missed an opportunity to highlight the challenges people would actually face.  Keep some wolves for drama, but explore the idea that climbing down the side of a mountain in Alaska in the dead of winter would be challenging without the wolves.  Maybe I'm being too critical, but I felt like the story would have been richer if it were a little more realistic.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is a fun and amusing way to pass the time.  The levels are hard, but not overly challenging, so it's good for most ages.
B0086700CM|3.0|This game was ok it is kind of boring and not to entertaining as plants v.s zombies. If you are here look at that.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I find this to be a bit challenging to say the least.  The laugauge, even though it is English has been hard for me to follow.<br />I find myself putting it down frequently after just a few pages. Being that it is so long, it will take me forever to finish. One positive I can speak of is it does take you far, far, far away to a land that seems so beautiful that I want to go and see what that side of the world looks like.  The characters are also so interesting and descriptive. I will continue my journey with it and I hope to finish it before too long.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I read The Pillars of the Earth a long time ago and didn't realize there had been a sequel.  Follett does his research well.  I felt I was there in Medieval England walking the pathways and standing in the cathedral.during ceremonies.  You can't miss if you choose a Follett novel.
1878424114|5.0|Deepak is a wonderful author, and seemingly a wonderful man.  I have read several of his books and meditated with him online. This book carries you through a step by step process to fulfill your desires. It is easy to follow and if you stick to his concepts, I believe things will work out for you in obtaining your dreams. It certainly is on a spiritual level and its impact is felt while you are reading it. It takes you on a deep spiritual journey and sometimes you get lost in the moment. You feel you can accomplish anything at anytime. He promotes strength and success. He also allows you to know everything you have is within you and you have the control and power to change anything.  I LOVE HIM
0739340131|5.0|Unlike most books on tape, the characters in this story are all voiced by different actors, making the story even more enjoyable and easy to follow.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I wasn't sure about this case at first but after watching the video on Amazon I had more thought that it would work for me. Once it came it was great. it put my screen to sleep when I closed it and it was light and comfortable to handle and use. If  I had to choose again I would choose the same one.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Good condition. No issues with shipping. Imagine Dragons has a very unique, pleasing sound. My boyfriend loved this as a Christmas present, but I'm finding to love it just as much!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|it makes searching the web easy. I have no complaints about this app. it was a little weird at first but I like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once again Colleen Hoover draws the reader into an amazing story full of twists and turns. I love when reading a book you don't know which direction it will take and to make you produce many gasps along the way. Holder and Sky will have you hoping for them all the way
B0086700CM|5.0|Once you start playing you continue to try to get farther. It keeps you saying, just one more run, about fifty times!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Good story but at times a bit slow moving.  Concernes too much detail on Guns etc. as if deliberately trying to fill up space to make a thicker book !
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Literally the best book I have ever read! I have read a lot of Navy SEAL books and this one is by far the best'
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Good value, adequate protection, Slim and lightweight design, comfortable in the hands, ordered one for my iPad mini, no complaints.<br /><br />Recommend
081299471X|3.0|I found the use of different writing styles and the use of obscure terms made the book difficult to read, and the links among the various chapters were weak, with the final message more anticlimatic rather than insightful.  I found it overrated.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|amazing rick riordon did it again he blew my mind with anamazing book. i love mark of athena and i cant wait for the next one thanks rick for all your books
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was most certainly a \\"page turner\\" for me.  I couldn't put it down and read it through putting my household chores on hold.  I was impressed by the historical research the author did before writing the book.  I felt like I understood more fully the ugliness of slavery and the repressive attitudes of most slave owners during that period in our country's history.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not a bad book by any means. In fact, I really enjoyed it, but it was fairly predictable. Storyline is laid out well and character development is good, but the predictability keeps this one at 4 stars for me.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A fantastic read... i couldnt put it down... not your usual 'who dunnit' novel... i enjoyed the changing narrators and their perspectives....definitely a great read.
0525478817|5.0|I never had a book make me cry as much as The Fault in our stars. Amazing book. My new favorite.
B002RHL8DC|4.0|Other reviewers have stated it as well. It's just a different type of show from the other Stargate shows. One that I loved, and was very sad it was cancelled.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing. At some points it can be  really sad. I was  crying at the saddest part. This  book alternates point  of  view, like Auggie to Miranda to Via etc. This is on  of the best books ever totally worth 10.00 !!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I grabbed this app on a whim since its free and was really impressed with it. The level of information it gives is so useful, and I especially love that it calibrated the program for my device specifically. When my battery is running low, I know how much time I have left reading, listening to music or during the web. Especially useful on long plane rides. I really love this app and made sure to have it on my android phone and kindle fire
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a great book. I could not put it down! Would highly recommend reading it.<br />It was one of those books that kept you wanting more!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's easy and fun and very addicting so I would say go for it it's free get it and you will experience the fun
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing!! I loved it!! Such a sad book but an awesome story line. Didn't lose interest once. Good job !
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I love this case cover for my iphone 4s from SPRINT. Fits perfect even though it says its for AT&T and Verizon iPhones. Update your description Amazon as it does indeed fit the Sprint version of the iPhone 4s.
B005O64VH8|5.0|This is a very soothing cd to listen to.  Secret Garden is one of my favorites and this is right up there with the best.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I guess this could be one of those stories what happens in vegas did not stay in vegas! Very delitful and funny!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Ther are too many spam posts / adverts that can't be hidden. Much better to go direct to the F/B webite. App is a waste of time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am addicted to this game, it challenges my brain activity and keeps me competing with the last score.  Love the game, and most important in today's economy; it is FREE!
