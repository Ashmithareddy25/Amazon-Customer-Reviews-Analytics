B0041D843M|5.0|Probably the most significant book I have ever read! The study was so compelling, my husband and I stopped eating meat as we were reading along and then quickly quit all animal protein based foods!  This is a MUST READ for EVERYONE who wants to live a long and healthy life!!
B008JFUS28|5.0|To be perfectly honest, everything about this movie was excellent. There were a few cheesy moments and those seemed to be the ones shown on TV interviews, which made me worry a bit for the movie's success. However, it absolutely did not disappoint and those scenes blended with the rest of the film wonderfully. I think Loki was written much more truly to his God of Mischief roots, what with his sarcasm, jokes, and teasing of his brother. There was real drama, serious plot twists, but it was a super fun ride and, as the title of my review noted, I will absolutely be buying this the moment it comes out. It was Marvelous.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I read this book before but I think I just didn't understand it. After I  re-read Enders Game and then watched the movie and I read this book again and I must say that Card really gets you tied to characters and made me show enough emotion to cry! Great and amazing book! 10/10
B003L77G6A|5.0|What should be evaluated here? The quality of the disks? Well good quality, good blu ray image.  Or the quality of the content? If you are a techie or a geeky person you would easily like it and laugh.  If you are a &#34;regular&#34; person you'll laugh a little less. Lol
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am in love with this app. fun for all ages. updates are awesome for more challenges. and love the added characters

0439813786|5.0|This book is absolutely beautiful inside and out.  The amazing black-and-white illustrations appear every couple of pages, so it's more like seeing a movie than reading a book!

B000002KDS|5.0|Original Alice Cooper Band with Bob Ezrin, you need nothing else. Fantastic story telling backed up by the tightest band in the business. If stranded on a Island bring this, Love It To Death, Schools Out, and if you have the room Billion Dollar Babies.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|the movie is good, but the sound quality totally SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wHEN PEOPLE TALK, HAVE TO BLAST THE VOLUME TO HEAR WHAT THERE SAYING, THEN HAVE TO TURN IT DOWN AS SOON AS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS KICK IN...............NOT THE FIRST TIME WITH AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO.....
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I cannot really explain why I loved reading it, but if you make it 100 pages in or so, chances are you will be sucked in to this amazingly detailed and unique series of worlds. This is probably not a typical style of book I read, I generally like more humorous or books with action or whatever, but I am glad I read this. It may not grab you right from the start, but it is thought provoking, rich, at times funny, exciting, and sad. It is most certainly not a feel-good type of book, but I really enjoyed it. Sometimes I was frustrated at the choices the characters made, but I think they were appropriate because of how richly the characters are described. This book can leave you sitting contemplating about it and is a great discussion book.<br /><br />I could go on about the plot and other things I liked, but instead I will offer a slight critique that I did not read anywhere.<br />One thing I would say negatively is that sometimes I felt like descriptions of rooms or whatever sometimes went on for too long. That is partly why this world is so rich, but at times it just seemed like irrelevant details and after a few pages about a cabinet, I was just like, &#34;alright, I get it, move on&#34;.  The other thing is that I have never read such long run-on sentences. It is kind of the style and worked at times, but literally whole-page sentences were just awkward, occasionally.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|great album, loved it, this guy kills a guitar. Puts on a really great show. Doesn't need amps. Bought each of my daughters a copy.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Pulse is a great little health tracker, the mobile app and web app aggregate your data in easily understood displays.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I like it. But some of the emojis don't make sense together. I think that you should get more coins after passing a level depending on how fast you finish it.
0062238868|1.0|Among the many extraordinary things Chris Kyle may have done in his life, particularly those intended to help veterans, this book sadly cannot count among them.  It is just self-congratulatory crap.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I can not wait for the next movie of the man of steel to come out. Great movie, would totally recommend it.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I've known people like these characters ... dialogue is so fitting ... I visited with Tommy Lee Jones after viewing numerous times and this was a perfect role for him.  I wish that he and Duval would make another movie together.  One of my favorite all time westerns.  I did get in trouble after watching the movie with my 3 year old grandson who later told his Mother he was going to get a &#34;poke&#34;.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I have this app on my Motorola Razr M and on my Nook. This is a very good program if you have an interest in the moon phases and knowing where it will be at a given time. The photos of the moon are very detailed.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|No logic or strategy needed, just double click any hexagon with the same colors, than tap the color.  Easy.  You do have to find the starting point, but after that just follow the double click method.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun way to waste your time, particularly since I had the free version. Eventually beat it and actually wanted more levels. Not too easy but not too hard either. I did get this free, but I might pay a little for it if I actually paid for apps.
B00992CF6W|1.0|So I'm trying to do a multiplayer with my sister I can join her but she can't join me and I hate it they need to fix it she has a tablet I have kindle my brother he has kindle and I can't join him and he can't join me fix it
0061119725|5.0|I love big books to use in my pre-k classroom.  When children are sitting on the carpet, they can all see the pictures and the words much better than with a regular sized book.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Of course the viewer will like it. It's another &#34;Tom Cruise&#34; movie. Good action although a bit off the planet. After the movie, I wander where and how the base in the space came about. Anyway, Mr. Freeman did a good job with his short part in the movie but could have been a stronger character. This movie is only a &#34;one bagger&#34; of popcorn.
068987751X|5.0|Great book to use in a preschool setting when studying the zoo and animals.  The children love to guess what animal is in each cage/box.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the books. I didn't like the ending...at all. I understand why Ms. ROTH would end it that way but still, I didn't enjoy this book as much as one or two. Four and True are great characters. Ugh!!!!
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Damian Stevenson set the bar high with Operation Armada and I had big expectactions for the sequel (this book). Once again the author did not fail to disappoint. The story is filled with drama and action, lots of blood and shootouts. The story enwraps in a really fast pace, which brings even more tension inside the reader's mind. Wonderful work.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is a good movie.  The main character is a great actor.  Any boy who likes superhero movies would love Iron Man.  It is an awesome movie for boys.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|The author really took his time in perfecting this book. The visions with which the main character Nate struggles feel so real and the way they are described actually make you feel that you are inside his head. The story contains a lot of life phisophy, drama and action. A very entertaining read!
B00C8RFS82|5.0|It is a good movie.  My son really likes it.  It is great for boys that like the superheros.  I would recommend it to other parents.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy Candy Crush is available fir Kindle!  I sm so addicted to this game. Levels are fun and sometimes hard. I play it day and night.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|A great take on rock standards.  Very surprising and exciting arrangements. The sound of the cello adds a new level of mystery and suspense to the songs.
0395389496|5.0|If your child likes Christmas and trains, this is a gorgeous picture book including those elements.  I bought this book for my sons when they were little and for my nursery and kindergarten classroom.  It is a classic and a perfect Christmas gift.  The illustrations are luminous.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another fine novel by John. Kept my interest peaked for a couple of days. He does not write a bad novel.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|I LOVE Zooey Deschanel's voice, so I was super psyched when I saw she had a Christmas album. It is very low-key with sort of an island theme (features a ukelele). The part that I was not a fan of was the echo. There is heavy use of voice echo in this album, and I am just not a fan of that technique. To me it takes away from the singer's voice, and in this case, that is really disappointing since her voice is so lovely. I listen to a few songs, but most of it just sits in my library.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is by far 1 of the best. Gun fights and stealing cars is the most common part in game. End wasn't that good though
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of my 5 island movies. This is how I describe it to people who haven't seen it and assume it's a romantic comedy (it is not): This is a movie about love. Love, as we all know, is complicated, is not planned, and it does not always have a happy ending. In addition, love comes in many forms, not just romance. This movie portrays all the faces of love: first love, unrequited love, love taken for granted, friendship and unconditional love. The movie follows several story lines, but it never feels choppy or confusing. It is quite funny, and it features a really strong cast. If you haven't seen it, give it a shot.
B00471TLZS|2.0|It is a matter of preference. This film does nothing for me. It is not even comedic. Some people just love it and good for you. I find it to be trite. Not even silly. It is well filmed.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was a  great conclusion to the three book series throwing twists and turns in the story that you did not see coming.  But more importantly it showed the negative side to trying to control people's psychological make-up and dictating knowledge and wisdon in our world based on training. Would recommend this book for anyone dealing with teens.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Yo or no so go lo to no act no no so  no  coco home do cu duck so Leo
B00D2I8E46|1.0|Shuck and jive. Costello, the ultimate dilettante. Not funky, not clever, just a trite waste of time. Did ?uestlove think this s*** would sell units?
B004BUGCRK|1.0|This is not the entire concert that you receive on the CD. Very disappointing download. The name should be &#34;Some of the Live in Berlin Songs&#34;
B008JFUO72|5.0|This is a great movie! Like all the marvel movies it has a lot of of action. The best Iron Man movie so far.
B005LAIII0|5.0|The DVD on how the movie was made is almost as good as the feature film. Both are a testament to human creativity and perseverance.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Wasn't sure how I felt about moving to another keyboard after using Swype for years. However, once I began using it I truly did enjoy it. The predictive text was spot on nine times out of ten. The settings are expansive, really making the program work in the manner that you text/type.<br /><br />For those of you that like stats/goals/achievements, the app has a lot of nifty ones built in. I personally only look at the length I've swiped and how many words I've saved by using the app.<br /><br />There are a lot of visual enhancements as well, changing both the color and layout of the keyboard and the color of the swipe.<br /><br />Worth the money. Fun to use.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Beautiful graphics, unique story line with a twist.  If you like Tom Cruise and SiFi you'll like it.  Worth renting.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|A must read. It's really that simple.  It's a world full of characters the reader just gets absorbed in, and that's not a bad thing.
B0013F1D02|2.0|Claire Danes isn't enough to make this movie shine.  Perhaps the book is better, but I found the movie to be disjointed and the characters quite shallow.  I rather liked some of the ideas, but as a movie it simply didn't interest me.
0992251656|5.0|seems to be a great game with 4 like minded friends, just be prepared for a 3-4 hour game.  There's heaps to do during the game so it keeps it interesting and i really like how strategies change throughout.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works, out of the box!  In the past I purchased the more pricer Roku to stream Netflix to other devices.  The Roku works wonderfully.  But for my needs, the inexpensive Chromecast does just as good, if not better job.  I will be ordering more for Christmas gifts for friends and family.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This was action from start to finish!  I can't wait to start on the next book in the series. The author keeps it thrilling!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|So charming! I love these quirky characters. Production values are excellent and the acting, superb. Why can't we get more tv series of this quality?
B002NWXRYY|5.0|Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin make a great team in this movie. It is funny and anyone watching this movie will like it as much as I did
B004HGBUVG|5.0|I love Lucinda Williams and this is one of my favorite CDs of her!  A more mature sound... love it!
B0041WVTBM|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. It remains a favorite of mine until this day. It hits on all levels of our own lives. Makes<br />you reflect. An absolute all star cast!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A rather easy ready, I finished in it two night's worth of reading. I adore liane moriarty's writing style. I definitely recommend this book for a perspective shock. You never know how your mistakes, troubles, trials, and changes are going to influence your future.
B000TFHJJQ|5.0|Always love a movie with Sly in it! Cliffhanger is exciting and the photography is beautiful. Spend an evening or afternoon with this movie, you won't be disappointed!
B003O86FMW|5.0|second time reading it and I enjoyed it as much as the first time! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the hunger games.
B009NW9QE2|5.0|One of my FAVORITE Movies. GR8 this time of year!<br />Bottle of Red (or White) + Cozy Blanket =  ^-^<br />Will the guys like? If they love you, they will.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|Bought this as a gift for someone else who wanted it.  I've never seen it myself.  Can't really rate it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so excited for this book. I didn't like anything about it. It had none of the spark the first two had. Dull plot line and the ending was a total let down. Not excited for the movies now. I'm an avid reader & get emotionally connected to the characters and their stories and good stories stick with me. I'm hoping to forget this one.
B002ZG994U|3.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who wanted it.  I've never seen it myself.  Can't really rate it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I did this five star rating because it's pure perfection. Never in my life have I read a book like this. It's different. Not a book you'd stumble across. It's not your average book. That's what gives this book that special spark. I liked how John Green made the characters unique. You know that in every story the characters are all insecure or something. But in this book, Hazel and Augustus aren't like that. They think outside the box. The way you're  suppose to think. I disliked how the author made Augustus die. It was very disappointing. And upsetting. But overall, the book was absolutely amazing!!!! Thank you John Green!<br /><br />  -Janely P.
B0000041DF|5.0|These are among the greatest of Argerich' performances. To say the music is divine is carrying coals to Newcastle but it is indeed.  Perfectly satisfactory in every way. Isn't it great to have disks forever?
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Love this app.  It's free and I can listen to thousands of music for free!!!  Not just famous artists either.  NOPE!!!  There's thousands of unsigned artists that posted their songs on here for the world to hear.  Tons of FREE DOWNLOADS as well.  My favorite artist on this site/app has to be D the Delinquent.  Amazing artist among many others.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers held my attention from the beginning to the end.  Being a super hero movie fan, I found the movie to be fast paced and full of action from the very beginning that built up more and more towards the end.  I enjoyed all of the leading characters and their individual strengths.  From the intellectual conversations between the Hulk and Iron Man, the conflicting love of brotherhood in Thor, to the superheroes forming a bond that brought them closer in working together and becoming a team.  It was a very good scripted and directed movie.  I look forward to the next edition.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I LOVE this app it's AMAZING. It's so AWESOME you can be the Dark side,or,the good side. There is little maps if you get them there's a BONUS level. It is,AMAZING,FANTASTIC,SUPER STUPENDOUS,AWESOME, LOL ,THIS LITTLE PIGGY, SUPER DUPER,YIPPY. I'm just glad I got it.
B00AEFY08O|4.0|Difficult to categorize this film's appeal.  Gump is not very smart, yet manages to do so many things right in this film, including becoming a football star, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, a Ping Pong champion, a distance runner, and eventually a multi-millionaire, etc.  Yet his romantic advances to the free spirited Jenny, capably played by Robin Wright, misfire.  But even here, he stumbles from success to success while she becomes caught in a declining death spiral that almost leads to suicide.  However miraculously she and Forrest click in a way that will satisfy the viewer.<br />The history of a turbulent era in American history and some of its leaders and failures make the film worth viewing.  Watching a naïf like Gump serve as both catalyst and pawn in our history is far fetched, but still fascinating to watch.<br />The actors are terrific and make the film one we will remember.  I recommend it highly.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I would have liked more things for the film but everything was great, the shipment arrived on time and I'm glad for that.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This classic, of course, was a repeat viewing--but what a treat! I have never seen Casablanca so crisply presented in both picture and audio. This was like a movie I'd never seen before, with visual and audio nuances that were lost by the media in prior viewings. I viewed this through a Hulu connection to Amazon on a 10-year-old Panasonic 50 inch plasma screen with an equally old Sony audio system.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The DVD's where in excellent condition on arrival and everything seems in order when received, it's working perfectly and I'm happy for that.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|A bit choppy and laggy when streaming PC content but other than that, works seamlessly over connections and does the trick!
0316322407|5.0|Outstanding! Hard to comprehend how so many women in the world are relegated to &#34;second-class citizen&#34; status. I put this in the category of the move &#34;Once a Slave&#34; which I thought excellent!
B001HN6918|5.0|Gave as a gift to grandson who is 8 as it was on his Christmas list. He loves it. Sign me, a Happy Grandma!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Absolutely love this device. I don't have cable or satellite in my home but I do have high speed wi-fi so this device is perfect for the TVs in my home that I can't connect computers to. I only wish this has been invented before now.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|amazing fanally<br />with a twist ending she did it agen<br />read this series in oder though<br />the end allbeit is SPOLER: sad
031623480X|5.0|Great book, with lots of great science to back it up. I highly recommend this book to anyone concerned about their health.
B0087X728K|5.0|This is the best paste on the market as far as I am concerned.  Never had a problem with this paste.  Works great!
B00632HWOG|3.0|I like my laptop version of Yahoo mail, but I am not all that happy with the Yahoo Ap. Decide for yourself.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great book that was easy to read yet full of helpful information. Well written with insight into the world of creativity and the possibilities of imagination.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Thsi is clearly one of the best purchases I have ever made. I urge anyone who loves on demand movines and TV shows to consider one. I love ours.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great little device; can't wait for more supported apps. The Cast extension for Chrome also needs some polish. *tips hat*
B009PNQUXO|5.0|This is indespensible for those of us who like to determine our own entertainment. It enables me to keep track of my favorite shows.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|[Update for v1.2.0 as tested on 7 Mar 2015]<br />- Good to see they've finally updated the Appstore version to be the same as the Play Store, although I am not sure what new stuff if any v1.2.0 brings. The previous v1.1.9 was supposed to have a &#34;Spooky Halloween update&#34; but I failed to find anything new there too.<br />- This is available in the Play Store as an ad-supported free version. The Flurry module is likely a leftover from there. There are no signs of Flurry activities in this paid Appstore version, and it runs fine offline.<br />- The minor complaints in my original review seem not to have been addressed, including the lack of an exit option, doesn't support replaying certain levels, etc. So, regrettably, I am letting my 4-star rating stand. I still recommend you give it a try while free though.<br /><br />[Original review for v1.1.1]<br />Gameplay could not be simpler: King Oddball is hell-bent on destroying the military, and he has three stones to do it for each stage; he grabs the stones & swing them left and right like a pendulum, and you tell him when to release them. In that regard, it's similar to the Gold Miner games. There are no different weapons you have to choose from, no need to consider the amount of force, etc., just look for the right spot to hit (and hope any knock-on effects prove deadly for the enemy) & wait for the right moment to release. Simple.<br /><br />Its simplicity makes it easy to pick up, and hard to put down. The graphics and sound, while equally simple, complement the game well.<br /><br />If you kill three or more enemies with one stone, you get another stone. If the stone you threw ricochets back at the King, you get to keep it for another go too. (Although it seems if hit by such ricochets three times in a row, the King will get a headache & disappears, and you'll have to restart the level.)<br /><br />Apart from the big 9-grid map (the Regular World) where you start off, you also get 6 extra levels by entering the correct words when you &#34;talk to the King&#34;, and there's also a secret Moustache World with another 140 levels (x=8, y=7 however is an empty level) which can only be unlocked after collecting all the moustaches. When you add the Hall of Diamonds & the One Stone Challenges levels in the Regular World, there are enough levels to keep you playing for days.<br /><br />All in all, this can be quite an addictive game. Personally I feel it's a bit overpriced at $2.99, but for $0.99 while on sale it's a steal.<br /><br />I would have rated this a 5 (assuming the price is $1.99 or less), but it's not without shortcomings. First of all, there's no exit button. Secondly, it does seem to consume more battery than games with equally simple graphics & mechanics. Thirdly, you can't replay completed levels in the Regular World (although you can do so in the Moustache World, the Hall of Diamonds & One Rock Challenges.) Last but not least, the version here in the Amazon Appstore is v1.1.1 but it had already gone through several revisions in the Google Play Store and the latest is v1.1.9. Together they are the reason why I just have to deduct a star.
B004UID2LC|2.0|This Ap is among the ones I consider a mistake. There are so many others that work better. Perhaps others may like it. I suggest reading a positive review. Someone must like it.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Been a while since I watched these prequels and I know this blu-ray version has been out a while so I finally forked out the cash to pick this one and the originals as well. The discs themselves are of top quality and Blu-ray has really set these films off ( especially the prequels ). i remember when these originally came out and being disappointed with them ( expectations were high ). Time and Hi-def however have been very kind to these films and as I look at what we have seen since these episodes were released and There is no question that Star Wars are the absolute best movies made in this genre and that includes Star Trek ( original series notwithstanding ). My 9 year old daughter got completely engaged in them as I went through and watched them all ( yes they are appropiate for young children ) she was sad to see the last one go off. To tell you the truth, so was I.
B00AEFYNTU|5.0|Funny, cute movie with good acting. Bought this so I have something to watch with my mom and her friends lol.
0345529057|5.0|I bought this set as a gift for my daughter, and I have read all of them myself. I love this series. I have since purchased the fifth book in the series and am in the process of reading it. A great read!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive..and I didn't realize u should watch your every move..it keeps me checking my lives...playing with my th friends is just a bonus.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One word awsomeeeee!!!!!!people please play this game the number one monarchy yay people but pc still better which I have but best game for devices
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun but takes a lot of your time your significant other will not like it!!! Have fun and play responsibly....lol
B009AMAJPA|2.0|Everyone in this movie is miscast, especially the two leads. The basic storyline is good, with a few surprises and a satisfying but predictable plot. The storyline is also a bit complicated, and because of the choppy, atmospheric directing style, it is not always clear exactly what is going on; which detracts from viewer's enjoyment. Noomi Rapace was not the best actress for this part, and her damaged face and clothing and situation just did not work. Her mother was a strange, odd addition to the mix. Colin Farrell was appropriately moody, and grungey; but his lack of articulation made the storyline hard to follow. Some of the set ups must have looked good in the design stage, like the two strangers waving from balconies in the same apartment complex; or the truck driving in to the house at the end,; or the warehouse wired with explosives; or the restaurant meeting next to the large plate glass window... but none of these elements worked well enough in the final movie. There is one very uncomfortable scene in which Terrence Howard the gangsta boss asks Colin Farrell the new recruit to bring him food when he'( the boss ) is waiting to trap the killer/tormentor/ note writer in a large empty apartment... nothing happens... and it's not clear what is supposed to be happening... it just hangs there...
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I've always wanted a videogame that allowed me the freedom to build my own Jurassic Park. I'm aware of Operation Genesis, but I was never able to find it in stores -- even used. Purchasing it online now would cost almost as much as a new videogame for the current generation. JP Builder is a wonderful substitute for Operation Genesis, and it allows my childhood dreams to become a reality.<br /><br />There are tons of different dinosaurs, each with the ability to be leveled up and evolved. The scenery and buildings available for purchase are also of great variety and each is beautifully detailed. The missions aren't very creative but you'll look forward to their rewards to continue updating your park. The graphics are vibrant and sharp and the numerous options available make sure you never grow tired of the game. Plus, IT'S FREE! If you work hard  on your park you may never even need to pay for extra content, unless you're impatient, which I'm not. However, The ever expanding content includes the only downside to JP Builder: You can only play the game when you have an internet connection.<br /><br />The game is a lot of fun. It's free. And it allows you to be creative. I highly recommend it.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|If you're the type of person who thought Transformers was a good movie then you probably gave this heaping pile of cliche four stars. This was awful and I want the last 120 minutes of my life back, plus the $3.99 with interest.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great way to waste loads of time when you could be productive just  doing life in general. :) I'm finishing this off as best I can!
0131480057|5.0|I looked at a lot of Linux books before purchasing this one. I am not saying that this is the ultimate one for your need, but this is honestly a great book on Linux and Unix Administration. This book covers a lot of information including installing Linux, file formats, building software, the kernel, boot loaders, virtualization, (including much much more).

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|similar to the original mario brothers, but one player. my favorite quick play game, just a tad hard to play it long on my kindle without hand cramps. very addictive. :)
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Very good. This brings ingenuity, style and well, guns to the table. The only problem is well, it updates about as much as Gun Club 2.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Holy heartbreak. This book was… amazing.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. I loved it so much more than I thought I would. I honestly don’t remember the last time I loved a book like this. It’s been a long while.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is adorable! It was an absolutely adorable, heartbreaking, beautiful, sweet story. And oh, that ending! The ending was perfect and hopeful. It couldn’t have ended any better. It brought tears to my eyes and made me so happy for Eleanor and Park.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pick up this book. It’s lovely and bittersweet.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|There were a few things I did not care for in this book but the good writing, story telling, fun, and sci-fi-Ness of it out weighed everything bad by a factor of ten. Enjoy.
B00E9A656K|5.0|got this because a friend said it was fun, i have to agree with him. when im in the bathroom makes the time pass.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I use to love to play all the time but they keep making it harder to complete the rooms by having non tradeable and making them to hard to get. I have played one room every day since it opened and still can't get the one item I need. I am over wasting my time!!!!!
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I like the different tip widths - they will fit a wide variety of circumstances.  Wish the top locked onto the body more tightly.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love kik and if you don't put it back up by thanksgiving day I'm going to sell my kindle and switch to a Google tablet and never use Amazon again I'm soo pissed at yall
B00BATG18K|5.0|This is a wonderful story, I enjoyed so very much getting to know these characters. Amy Tan is a great storyteller and there are few authors who are as engaging as Amy Tan.<br /><br />You will want to savor this book, but you can't not finish!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game! It is pretty addicting and some levels are really challenging but is worth it. I recommended if you want a brain challenge lol
B000062Y98|5.0|Exactly what I wanted and my husband will love it as part of a anniversary gift.  I will be buying more.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great movie for the holidays.  Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire -  Brings back memories of Christmases gone by.  One of my all time favorites, along with White Christmas, which is similar in some respects. Can't beat the old Christmas movies.
B00000ITOY|5.0|We love this you. I often give it as a first or second birthday gift. Ours is 7 years old, and looks perfect--the paint has never cracked. Heirloom quality, super educational.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun, really addictive, just wish that they didn't have items to buy. I wish more games were just games and didn't tempt to buy items to &quot;help&quot; out.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Another smash album by the Queen of Pop! As she tries to shed her &#34;bubblegum-princess&#34; image, her style turn more into an Indie-Style, like Cider Sky, especially as mainstream pop has started to take a turn for the worse (as you can see from Miley Cyrus, I know, I know Forget The Haters, I dont care what Miley does as a person, I just dont think she is the best musician). Personally, my favorite songs from this album are<br />1.Double Rainbow<br />2.Ghost<br />3.By the Grace of God<br />4.Spiritual<br />5.Unconditionally<br /><br />  I think these songs prove that Katy Perry is a serious contender in the battle on the charts; she can write deep, meaningful songs as well. I do hope she returns to Christian music. She would be amazing in that genre. Keep the light coming, Katy!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Glorious. Beautiful. Painful. I won't ever forget this book. Quickly in my top five all time. Luminous. I can't praise it enough.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I can't give this album enough stars. Buy it. Buy it so much. Every song is so catchy and meaningful.
B004W4N55C|4.0|I have been using this app for months now and find it to be a good resource for learning cover tunes, especially if your new to trying to play covers. I'm more into playing original music but this app has helped me add some favorite songs to my set list to and helped me to play some requests by listeners.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good for relaxing while working the brain to keep sharp. Nice for all age groups. I would recommend to all.
B00FR3WZKI|4.0|I really dig this collection of reworking of Donna's music. I know a lot of people were disappointed by this album because they were wanting perfection. Well, it's not perfect but it's still really good. Don't expect extended remixes of the songs you know so well. These songs have been reworked and re-interpreted. I doubt this album will gain her any new fans but it's nowhere close as bad as a lot of reviews claim. I love Donna Summer and I really dig this album.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|has been working great on kindle fire with no problems. little slown loading but very detailed so no wonder why.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I went crazy when &#34;Applause&#34; was released and this album didn't let me down. It's got a nice darker edge to it. Way better than &#34;Born This Way&#34; and I loved that album. Critics will hate her because she's so popular. Well, she doesn't make her art for the critics...she makes it for us, her fans...and she's delivered a fabulous album of groovy dance songs. She's simply wonderful. Highly recommended.
B005V20JKI|1.0|This is a really fun game.  My boys played it a lot and unlocked a lot of levels and characters.  I found out recently that they stopped playing because an &quot;update&quot; a little while back locked levels they had already been playing.  To play those same levels, the developer wants $2 now.  That's ridiculous and I'm uninstalling it instead. I would not give these jokers a penny after pulling this stunt.  Too bad, too.  It was a neat game.
B0002YMOVW|5.0|Bought for Christmas, so anxiously waiting to see my girls playing with it, Love love the quality, cute little pots, everything calico critter is so cute and detailed. Excellent buy.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I loved this book. It gives a fascinating look at running/life that I found really motivating and powerful. I've recommended this to many of my friends.
0399255370|5.0|What a wonderful book.  I ordered this book as a gift for two children this Christmas.  A 5 year old and an slightly older autistic young boy and I think it is wonderful.  I was showing my husband and he was laughing out loud.  It is so well written and very nicely illustrated and it will also give a child and insight into thinking outside the box.
B0045TYDNC|4.0|Does what it says, no problems with it whatsoever. Fits perfectly on my lenses and I keep a couple of extras around just in case.
0880794968|5.0|loved this and would suggest everyone study this wonderful system of divination.  Very pleased with the quality of this product.
B008742O32|5.0|Incredibly simple to use. AirDroid gives you access to everything on your cell by displaying it on your computer via an internet browser.. I use it on my Samsung Galaxy 4s and it works flawlessly every time. For those of you concerned about security, you log into it using a web address or ip address with a port, then it gives you a password on your phone to verify it.... Love this app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was disappointed to see that I had reached the end. I wasn't ready to set it down. I am looking forward to the third one.
1412960991|5.0|The best reference book yet on how to do case studies for both beginners and advanced researchers.  Comprehensive and explanatory.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing on my phone. Happy to have a second option.<br />My son likes to play too. We compete with different levels.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had to think about this book for days after completing it. I had great conversations with a grandchild and family members that saw the movie. It is mentally stimulating and thought provoking.
1401234550|4.0|Geoff Johns has had a great run on Green Lantern. This new 52 launch is a great jumping on point for people who love Green Lantern or are just interested in the character.  I'd recommend it.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|While I loved Delirium,I got caught in the tedium of this new society being explained. Now that all of that past, and Lena has come into her own, I could not put this book down!!!
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|I love Rihanna's music. This is the third CD of her's that I have bought.  There are some great selections on here.
0156012197|5.0|One of my favorite stories! Arrived in perfect/new condition. Bought it so that I can read it to my son.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is a great album full of all of her hits! Would make a great stocking stuffer or general gift.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great. It is so much better than the standard Android alarm clock. The ability to gradually increase the sound volume is great.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I love Bruno Mars, he is so diversified in his music and songwriting, delivering so many styles. It's a good traveling mix.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|this was such a neat app! I showed it to every one in class and they liked it too. Way better than punching in numbers. It works well on kindle fire, no clitches or download problems
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game helps me clear my mind of frustration that is typically caused by my wife.  I am a searing kind person who has a big heart. In fact, it's so big that my loving wife finds it easy to trample on it when the mood suits her.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|The graphics are high quality. The game is fair, realistic and conforms to the laws of physics, unlike certain other games (Angry Birds.) I love that you have the option of practising offline or playing a random opponent online. A great use of my time!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this album.  I had this years ago and it was lost so I'm so pleased to have it again.  Norah Jones is an absolute favorite of mine.  She sings with such feeling and depth on each recording.  The whole collection of songs on this CD are outstanding.  You will enjoy this for years - it's timeless!
B00992CF6W|1.0|The multiplayer will not work so I can't put my world's on multiplayer<br />But it is very awesome on single player also
B000006YXV|3.0|I have heard so much about Marvin Gaye that we decided to try it.  I expected smoother softer music so I was disappointed.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|It had a good story going and then boom. when you realized at the end it was a complete turn around from what you thought it was going to be.
0439023491|5.0|Terrific and could not put it down so finished it much sooner than i would have liked.  An intense read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put this down. I loved the characters and the symbolism of the wool and the silo. Thanks for a good read.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|It was a good rental movie. Interesting idea, generic plot, good acting. Not an epic film but worth the price of admission.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This extension really works. Anybody who has a smart phone or the iPhone this is a great way to give a lot of feet on your cable which is a no-brainer for home, or travel. And it's only a few bucks. It obviously has many more uses. And price is right. Definitely get it
1609611543|5.0|Several times doctors have suggested that eliminating wheat might help me get rid of some chronic problems.  However, they never could tell me why?  This book tells me WHY very directly.  I would actually recommend that everyone read the book.
0756407915|5.0|Love his writing.  He is able to capture a new world and gains a wonderful artful thought provoking challenge for the readership
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is the first game I ever played like this. I liked the graphics in this game. I just wish that I didn't run out of energy so fast. I would recommend this game to everyone .
1250030951|4.0|I don't generally read realistic fiction, but a friend thought I might like this book because I'm big into fandom studies.  While some parts of the book were a bit slow for me, overall I really enjoyed it.  I like how excerpts of Cath's fanfiction are included in chapter breaks along with bits of the Simon Snow stories.  That was just a nice touch I thought.  And the book isn't so much about her as a fanfiction writer as it is about the coming of age story of a really nerdy fanfic writer.  But I thought the book did a pretty good job of explaining why Cath writes fanfiction and how important it was to her, without it taking over her character.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|It was a bit small for what I paid BUT I understand the whole Minecraft craze is why the price is higher!  My son loved it!
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|This was a cute back story of Sulley and Mike's relationship.  It was a nice way to show that everyone has different strengths and that that's okay.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I just love all of Pink's songs!  I like what she has to say!  My kids love her songs as well!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It worked for my kindle, and when my wife was having trouble with facebook on her kindle, I recommended it to her, and all is well....
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It is rare that I read a book and it leaves me exhausted, this book did that to me as I finished it.  It left  me exhausted and emotionally spent.  As I read the last words my chest felt heavy with sadness for a couple of reasons, the ending was not a happy one (this should not come as a surprise or a spoiler considering the subject matter) and I want to believe that a world described in this book never existed.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is searching for a story told that seems to come to life in its pages.  The Book Thief is one of the best reads I have had in a long time, I literally could not put the book down.  I will not go into the book's detail other than to say you will know every character in the book as a friend or an enemy by the time you finish it.  If you are like me and can read a book two and three times if it has meaning or is entertaining enough then you will think as you read the last page &#34;I cannot wait for the day when I read this again&#34;.<br /><br />Buy this book, enjoy this book and do not feel guilty for being human.<br /><br />Read this book and expect to read a story beautifully told from one of the darkest characters of the book. It is beautifully written.  I cannot imagine anyone being able to make a movie of this book and being able to capture the images as told in the narrative style of the book. I most likely will not see the recently released movie of this book because I have my own images of each character and I do not want that ruined, I have those images because the author is able to describe each character so vividly that the imagination does not need to work very hard to see and understand each character, they are who I have made them and I like it that way.<br /><br />Kudos to Mark Zusak, you have written a masterpiece and I thank you.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Probably one of the most intriguing movies I seen in a while. I didn't know what to expect, as it wound slowly and (I thought) aimlessly through these different settings......A movie that you think is over about half way through, and you think: Is That It?? But alas, as all great movies do, you have been drawn in to a deception of comfortable watching, thinking you know how typically the storyline is going, and it will end. It's like being in the ocean, and you look at the shore, and in a few minutes you're farther out and farther down; That is a Side Effect of this movie. Enjoy......
1476734941|4.0|The premise promoted in this book is interesting and believeable.  The actual practice of the method was not so easy, but that's my personal take.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read from start to finish...It grabbed you from the first chapter and kept you interested till the end of the book.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Cute<br /><br />I like it, it is not what I initially thought it would  be but it's still pretty darn cool.
B00EC7GRS6|1.0|There are much better aftermarket docks. This is a light piece of junk. It doesn't fit the Ultra well and you have to force it in each time even if you have only a skin on. The magnetic connector doesn't stick out far enough and each attempt to connect requires 5 minutes of fiddling. A super rip off.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so so<br />pleased to see that we could finally download this app on kindle fire....I love playing this : ) Thank you amazon!
030789701X|5.0|This book is very helpful.  It is a lot easier to read vs the regular Skyrim guide.  The index is also rearranged.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|The first unit arrived with a malfunctioning display, I returned it but I had installed the app on my nexus tablet. The app is great but the help file is outdated. I couldn't delete an erroneous weight entry.for example.<br /><br />When a working unit arrived I was impressed by the display and it's light weight. I strapped the tracker on and was impressed by its accuracy and the pulse meter. Everything synced perfectly on the first day and I recorded my sleep. The graph was interesting. I seem to sleep fairly well.<br /><br />When I woke up I charged the unit and went for a shower. I took a blood pressure reading and a weight measurement and manually entered them into the app. I clipped the unit on to my belt and went to work. After work I went to wal mart. I came out and I found that the tracker had separated from its holder! I had lost it! I looked for ten minutes and eventually found it. I resolved to place the tracker in an inside pocket. When I got home I washed my pants... ...the tracker was inside. It is not washproof. I managed to kill it. I would recommend getting into a routine  with this device as it is way too easy to misplace. I am now sad.<br /><br />EDIT- I bought a new one, I will try not to wash this one. when I went to charge the new one I found teh old (washed) one sat there charging and I solomnly removed it from it's cable to dispose of it. I looked down at my little dead friend imagining his circuits all full of water and non functional. his dead display forever dark.<br /><br />suddenly, the unit came alive \\"hello!\\" it said (the unit actually does say hello when it powers on which is quite cute). Then it said \\"error 1\\". Fair enough, I thought, the cicuits are probably fried anyway. I decided to do a long press to reboot the unit and it came back functioning normally. Surely the bluetooth wouldn't work? It worked. Surely the touch screen would be dead? It wasn't. surely the readings, when compared with a brand new unit over several days, wouldbe off? nope. The pulse meter had to be dead, right? wrong! it functions perfectly even after washing it.<br /><br />Now I have two of them, I ordered another one. This still makes me an idiot, just a different type.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I thought it was a good book. Grisham books are the same delicious cake with different frosting, but he keeps you coming back.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book brought me back to a world I didn't know existed. I am very impressed, by the work and feel mods should be done to help the North Korean people.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|An intricately woven and fascinating story around a boy coming of age and a painting that changes his life. Exquisitely and lovingly told.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|First game I got for kindle and can't stop playing. I love it.  Who would have thought that killing the world would be so much fun?
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I used another note taking app for my Kindle fire. At assemblies and conventions it is nice  to take notes. Thought I would give this a try and wish I used it from the start.<br /><br />Love it and being able to sync and get them from my pc is wonderful.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It is a great book I recommend  to 5th  graders  like me if you are looking for a great  book that is a little challenging or you are just looking for a great page turner  it makes you feel like you can make a difference for people with the disease he has and that you should be friends with them<br /><br />Read this book it is a great book:)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is amazing and is just as addictive as the ad says. My aunt got this game before I did and now we are both candy crush addicts. Anyone and everyone would like this game. If you like long games that are fun and difficult this is the perfect game for you.
B005544V6A|5.0|Best Season of show ever to appear on USA NETWORKS, really awesome pilot episode that shapes the bond for every episode to follow.
B00005MP58|5.0|Just awesome. Colin Firth is a fabulous Mr. Darcy and the rest of the cast is right on target in this wonderful Austen classic.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Brilliant, movie, came in great condition. the digital effects in this film really drive the endless quest to find peace once you've achieved so much in this world. Love this movie thanks so much.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game got me started with all the Angry Birds games!  It is challenging - sometimes extremely so - but not so much as to  become frustrating.  As a senior player I feel it helps my mind-eye-hand co=ordination.
B00E9A656K|4.0|I love this fanned rough edges this to a dinner with your family is a kindle and and sister brother sister
B00FWAZ87I|5.0|Originally I wasn't thrilled with the format of Arjen Lucassen's eighth Ayreon album, &#34;The Theory Of Everything.&#34; Four 20+ songs divided into a total of 42 tracks, ranging in length from 20-something seconds to just under 4 minutes... Ay yi yi. But with each spin, I've learned to leave my disgruntlement behind. &#34;The Theory Of Everything&#34; is just that fantastic. It contains that familiar fusion of progressive rock, heavy metal, electronic music, and folk instruments from past Ayreon albums. However, it's more experimental and instrumental than its predecessors. Some of the divided segments take on a normal verse-chorus structure, while others act as melody-driven monologues, conversations, or arguments. Recurring motifs and lyric verses also connect the songs’ themes and the characters’ conflicts. Hooks and contrasts abound here, as do solos from guest musicians such as ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett, Dream Theater keyboardist Jordan Rudess, and Nightwish piper Troy Donockley, among others.<br /><br />Concept-wise, this new Ayreon story isn't &#34;out of this world,&#34; as past albums have dealt with outer space and science fiction plots. &#34;Theory&#34; centers on human struggles with ambition, greed, finding one's life purpose, and solving one of physics’ most elusive equations. And the vocal line-up... Honestly, I don't know how Arjen keeps creating stellar singing casts with each album. Each vocalist plays their role with convincing emotion. I was particularly impressed by Marco Hietala as the Rival (he truly &#34;acted&#34; out his lines and is so much fun to listen to) and Cristina Scabbia as the Mother (a real comeback quality-wise, after letdowns with her past two Lacuna Coil albums).<br /><br />In short: No other artist comes close to creating a playground of sound the way that Arjen Lucassen does on his Ayreon records. &#34;The Theory Of Everything&#34; needed some time to grow on me - and it has done so, substantially. I even think I'd rank &#34;Theory&#34; right behind &#34;01011001&#34; as my favorite Ayreon album of all time.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This is an Awesome DVD. The songs, outfits were Awesome. I liked the way Cher did songs from the begining of her career when she was with Sonny.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|there has not been a single update for this app.  why?  no wonder people go to Apple products.  many updates there!  Apple is already on to Draw Something 2.  I don't recommend Kindle any longer.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|This is a Fantastic CD. I would recommend it to any Cher fan. The songs are the best and Cher sounds as good now as she did back when she was younger.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is  really good game m e for the kindle fire.  Just as go o d as a Pc. You should really get it.
B00AEBBA1I|5.0|I love this movie. Depp is stellar in his role as the Demom Barber! If you loved any movie from Burton you will love this one.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />From the beginning of Divergent, there was something magical about the idea of the city. The factions, the unique plot. I had never read anything quite like it. The second book branches out from the original plot,  but there is still something special. This book contained no sense of magic for me. I consumed the book, simply because I had to know how it ended, but it was far from enjoyable. The entire thing felt rushed, and the ending was a massive disappointment, not only because of Tris's death, but the way the city of the factions, the isolated city with its rituals and customs, just became another metropolis. I may get too attached to books, but this was tragic to me. The magic is gone.
B000002OTL|5.0|cd was in very good shape i was happy with the deal this system is requiring me to keep writing ?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We (me, my 6 &amp;5 year olds) are enjoying this game so far. We've only had it for a few hours.  The ads that pop up regularly are a bit distracting, but not the end of the world or inappropriate as of yet for this free game.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|the first book took me two days, the second book two weeks, and I finally finished this one.  as with the others the end read faster than the middle, but I an still torn about the whole thing ...
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game. It kept me occupied for a month! It's definately worth the 2 dollars. Its very fun. I recommend it for all ages.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Highly recommended to all. Very moving and thought provoking.  Will make you question love, life, and how choice is a privilege that not all are able to have.
0545586178|5.0|Good story, interesting continuation of character development, accessible writing for teens, appropriate topics (though the violence is a little rough).
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I started watching this movie with no information as to what the plot was about. I just knew it had to do with a plane crash, and I was thinking it was an action movie or something like that. To my surprise, this is not at all what this is about. The accident is the catalyst for a wonderful story to come.<br /><br />This is about a man's battle with his addiction, and how this affected his life. The way in which the situation is presented is clever and thought-provoking. The reason I am saying that is because Whip, a pilot that is an alcoholic and drug user, is in charge of a flight when things go wrong with the plane. Even though Whip was inebriated, he performed a series of miraculous maneuvers and landed the plane saving most of the passengers. Almost no one could have prevented everyone from dying, but now comes the question, even if the fault was mechanical, is the fact that Whip was fulfilling his duties in that state criminal behavior?<br /><br />The moments after the crash get a little slow, but the intensity of the movie soon picks up. Denzel Washington delivers an amazing performance, and we completely believe he is drunk / high when we see him on screen. The many relationships Denzel's has in the plot provide this story with multiple layer of complexity and we end up feeling like we watched a masterpiece.<br /><br />This is not a movie to watch if you are looking for some light entertainment, or for a relaxing-have-a-good-time type of film. But if you are looking for a compelling story, that will make you think and that provide drama at the highest level, this is it.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|When the formatting on Google drive is just not cutting it this is my go to program. This is also handy if I don't have any of my Google drive docs stored on my phone.
B008RC72G8|5.0|Good comedy version of the old show.  I enjoyed it. Decent script and fantastic soundtrack and score. Great cast.  Does Michelle Pfeiffer ever age?  She looks better than she ever has.  Johnny Depp has his usual strong comedic performance where he becomes the character.  Chloe Moretz, can you say up and coming superstar?  But Eva Green....sigh....any movie she's in deserves 5 stars.
B003274QH6|5.0|FRIEND RECOMMENDED. He was mesmerized by the story, the characters and action.  In fact, two friends swore by this series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was an awesome book, a page turner, I truly enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it.  The author did a lot of research on this book.
B000031XCR|5.0|Love ALL Celine! She is the best singer of all times and my idol. BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME was my absolute favorite, as well as My Heart Will Go ON...
0545626382|5.0|Read this! The story flows from book to book (you can read the summaries of the book so I am not going to do that for you here):<br /><br />Book I: Conditions of game…how it came about<br />Book II: Unfolding of the &#34;rebellion&#34; from both sides…how it affects the human body and mind :(<br />Book III: Full rebellion and the efforts for each side to &#34;win&#34;…WAR!<br /><br />I read a book a day…that's how much it captured my mind!
B00G91Z8AQ|3.0|Well, of all the Superman movies, this is by far my favorite.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty good. A slightly different approach but remains close to the basics. The weakest point of the storyline was the love story between Lois and Clark. It just didn't jive at all. Since a large portion of the movie revolves around Lois, the poor integration of Lois into the plot weakens the movie significantly. So, once I ignored the Lois portion of the movie, the rest was really good.<br /><br />The acting was very good, especially from Henry Cavill. Russel Crowe was a great Jor-El. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were good as the Clark's parents, but I feel no one will ever be as good as the parents of Superman as Annette O'Toole and John Schneider from Smallville. Michael Shannon was an excellent villain. It is nice to see Christopher Meloni in another role.<br /><br />The acting also had some weak points, especially from Amy Adams (Lois Lane) and Laurence Fishburne (Perry White). The audience is almost automatically made to dislike Lois and there is not a lot done to warm her up. There is a reason CSI got rid of Laurence Fishburne. Lois and Perry were by far the worst parts of this movie.<br /><br />The computer generated graphics were superb. Top notch.<br /><br />Family friendly: No cursing, no nekkid people, no sexual stuff. There is a lot of fighting and destruction.<br /><br />If the makers of this Superman would have left the Lois part out, or made it better, this would have been a really top notch movie. The rest of the cast and storyline keep it a good 3 stars.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|At this point, the only thing a Chromecast is good for is casting Netflix to your TV if you are already watching it on either your smartphone or laptop. I don't really know of anyone who endlessly entertains themselves by watching YouTube or even Hulu. I don't, at least. You technically can cast webpages to it using Google Chrome, but the image shown on the TV is nowhere near High Definition and there is a delay of about 1 second from the time you move around a webpage with your phone/laptop to the time it's updated on your TV. If Chomecast was rebranded as a Netflix caster it would make more sense. I'm sure it's usefulness will improve in time but my advice would be to let Santa get something else for your kids this Christmas. Sorry, Google. I Really love the vast majority of your products... Just not this one so much.  :-(

B00C5W3SBE|4.0|Enjoyable rendition of Frank Baum's books.  Got a bit too CGI for me.  Possibly if I got the wife to break down and get a great big 3D TV my opinion might differ.  The film was made for 3D, so watching it in 2D leaves a bit to be desired.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|At first I did not know what to expect from this book. I approached it carefully. I was quite impressed. Col. Corso did not hold back anything at all. Like the excellent soldier he was, he offered only straight talk. This book broadened my political knowledge regarding several issues: the Cold War, World politics, modern American history. I will definitely re-read this book at some time in the future<br />I recommend this book in the highest way!
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Don't know why the critics panned this.  Ok, problems in development.  So what?  Results are what counts, not re-writes, new directors, etc.  The results were great.  Different from the book in a lot of ways, but what book-to-film isn't?  Action, exciting, liked the evil government blackmail.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have both this and the Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson. I love them both. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful. It is really artistically very beautiful. (You can tell it's the same team that made Pride and Prejudice with Kiera Knightly-they both have the same melancholy feel.)  I think the Masterpiece Theatre version is truer to the novel; it is longer and develops the plot better, but I love this one just about as much. I watch both.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|Excellent soundtrack!  I loved the Lord of the Rings soundtrack and this surely does not disappoint.  There are descriptions by the composer regarding his choices for instruments, sounds, etc. for each track.  Even my kids love hearing it and asking me what part of the movie the music is from.  Great for all Hobbit fans!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Love this version! I own this one and the Mia Wasikowska version. Both are great, but this one captures their relationship with more depth. Their attraction makes sense in this version. This version is pretty true to the novel. I love that it is longer (about 3 hours) and that this enables a more complete story to be told.  I bought this based on reviews, and I am so happy I did. It's my favorite version to date.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS IS A FUN GAME!!!  A little too much fun, definitely more addictive than most games of its kind.  This is a match 3 game that is extremely popular.  I am so glad Amazon decided to make this available to their customers, but if you don't have &#34;Amazon Coins&#34; to make the in-app purchases of the different helpful booster candies, it could get really expensive really fast.  I have to &#34;take breaks&#34; every few days because I go through my &#34;Amazon Coins&#34; like wildfire each time I play this.  It's THAT addictive and costly.  I won't stop playing it, though. I'm hooked for life.  So will you if you decide to give this game a chance.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|I don’t actually hate all the mixes on this CD as much as most seem to, mostly because I would never expect anyone to be able to remix the original masterpieces (especially the Moroder/Summer collaborations) into something spectacular. So here are my thoughts on each mix:<br /><br />Love To Love You Baby – I absolutely love this mix of the song. Without changing much about his original production, even keeping the bassline pretty much intact, Moroder, along with Chris Cox of Thunderpuss, updates this classic into a modern electro funk track. It’s so sexy sounding.<br /><br />Dim All The Lights – pretty much agree with everyone on this one. It’s boring without all the vocals, and it only manages to update the sound to, well, the 90s. This is the kind of dub that would have been hot in a New York City club in late 1992/early 1993.<br /><br />Hot Stuff – Frankie Knuckles does what he does best, delivers a soft house mix. And yeah, it just isn’t the right tone for this disco rocker.<br /><br />I Feel Love – I think Afrojack pretty much gives this landmark synth track a thumping update, retaining the swirling synths and bassline of the original.<br /><br />Love is in Control – This is a bright pop remix. As much as I love Donna, I just never really got this song. It was so shrill—especially the chorus. Donna was a singer, not a screamer. I'll always be a team &#34;I'm a Rainbow&#34; LP as the one that should've been released in 82....<br /><br />Sunset People – I find this mix outstanding. Virtually cutting the tempo in half, it creates an atmospheric and sleazy track that really fits with the subject matter of the song.<br /><br />Working the Midnight Shift – I totally agree that it is a shame they didn’t use Donna’s vocals. But I think the mix of the song is actually awesome. It is a sleek funky electro house groove—Donna’s vocals would have put it over the top.<br /><br />Bad Girls - I personally think the remixer here absolutely locked in to Donna’s vocal delivery and crafted a song that complements the nuances of her performance. The music just works in sync with her vocal so perfectly—it manages to sound like she sang to THIS mix.<br /><br />MacArthur Park – I love Laidback Luke, so I’m feeling his instrumentation on this song, but I agree with others that this song is just too beautiful and epic for this kind of techno-electro club feel.<br /><br />I Feel Love – I’m bored just even trying to think of words to describe this lifeless track. There’s really no sign of the original song at all.<br /><br />On The Radio – brutal. I can’t imagine anyone getting any joy out of listening to this downtempo mess.<br /><br />Last Dance – Eh. This sounds like typical Masters at Work…from the 90s. Lounge house music.<br /><br />La Dolce Vita – I’ve seen this described as a Crayons outtake like that’s a bad thing. I loved the fresh sound of the Crayons album, so I’ll take it. This is a light, happy pop tune and I’m psyched to have one last new song by Donna.in to Donna’s vocal delivery and crafted a song that complements the nuances of her performance.

B00FAPU0UK|5.0|\\"Bedroom Games: 1\\" is the \\"get excited while you are spooked\\" sort of read. There is Pamela, the protagonist, who likes to play games with her lovers. There is also a serial killer on the loose, who just claimed his fifteen's victim. He too, likes to play \\"games.\\"<br /><br />It's hard to avoid spoilers, so suffice it to say that there is constant tension throughout the story that builds up towards the finale. An observant reader will notice how the authors juxtaposed the serial killer and Pamela, as if hinting that there's really a thin line between \\"innocent\\" fun and sinister obsession.<br /><br />This is a masterfully written story that suggests, teases, and leads the reader while letting her imagination wide open to the possibilities. Make it a drinking game: Every time you get spooked while reading this story, take a shot of whatever gets you through the night. I bet you'd be flat on your back by the time you turn the last page.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I think the role of the antagonist was a bit over acted, but I liked the story.  The real appeal to these later-day Star Trek movies is the look and sound of my 50&#34; Plasma TV and surround sound system.  Awesome!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This Showtime series is riveting.  The acting is superb and the writing is so close to real world events.  I do not subscribe to Showtime, so having the series on DVD is very nice.

Her hjourney somehow leftme feeling relieved of lifes burdens as they seem so simple compared to what she went through even though I went through similar things.

B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Best superman ever. Well laid out contrast between statism vs. individualism.  Krypton a socialist paradise come to its unavoidable conclusion and the choice comes down to Zod, statism..tyranny, and Superman's father, individual liberty and rights. Zod was the perfect character of the person who thinks a few should rule over the many while Superman strives to give even those who were weaker, the humans, freedom of choice and respected those choices. Superman had hope that eventual even the weak would achieve great things through free will.

B005G4TJUC|1.0|The same tradition of immaturity from Revenge of the Fallen continues. The action scenes are so busy they are a chore to watch. The jokes fall flat. The actors, voice and live-action alike, are doing a good job. Unfortunately, the script they are reciting is awful.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Decepticons are hiding in a predictable location given the name of the movie, and they want to enslave Earth. To accomplish this, their plan is to teleport their home world nearby. The original leader of the Autobots is convinced this is a good thing.<br /><br />Ironhide dies unnecessarily. Optimus Prime achieves peace by killing without mercy. Although humans win the day with some robot help, the ending is not satisfactory.<br /><br />Sentinel's betrayal is clumsy. Shockwave is boring, and his overgrown drill bit gets entirely too much screen time. It is disappointing when Starscream dies. Mr. Gould is an unnecessary human bad guy that doesn't get zapped soon enough. The injured Megatron is still strong enough to knock out the elder Prime, yet manages to get killed by a one-armed Optimus.<br /><br />So much for a satisfying end to the series. Maybe Age of Extinction will be better. Transformers: The Movie from 1986 certainly was.
0061950726|5.0|Great book. I truly loved this novel, and recommended it to my book club.<br />It has an historical base. I learned a lot from this book about the real Orpan Trains that existed in this country, and got a feel for what foster care can be for some children, even today. A must read!

B00GNAO70K|4.0|Chloe Moretz has come a very long way since starring in the 2010 movie Kick Ass. And she is only getting better with each role she plays in. With a supporting cast that includes Judy Greer, Julianne Moore, and many others, here is my review on Carrie.<br /><br />The film starts out very strange; almost to the point of you wanting to look away from the screen. Nonetheless we are soon introduced to Carrie (Chloe Moretz): shy, quiet, and an outcast. She is often teased, and when she is not being teased she is being kept up by her overly religious mom. And soon enough, Carrie comes to slowly understand why she is not like everyone else. You see the things that happen in this movie. And you want the conflict resolved. And for the most part, the conflict in the story is resolved exactly how you would expect it to be.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is top notch. Chloe Moretz embodies the character of Carrie extremely well. Julianne Moore had a very realistic approach playing Carrie's mom. Supporting cast was good too.<br /><br />All in all, while Carrie is once again a movie I would not consider to be scary or terryfing, it is a film that is quite enjoyable and exciting to watch. You are in for quite a surprise. Definitely one I will buy when it releases on dvd.<br /><br />7.8/10<br /><br />Upcoming reviews: The Hunger Games, The Hunger Games:Catching Fire,
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This movie was just &#34;ok&#34;. Nothing really stellar about the movie. Some good special effects for the most part in the movie.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|A fine novel.  A good wrap to the trilogy.<br /><br />Reading reviews of Allegiant spoiled the plot twist, but made the events more understandable.<br /><br />I liked the ending because it really made the whole Trilogy become a story about Tobias.  His growth, his evolution, his acceptance of himself.  Lessons learned quickly by Tris.<br /><br />Very good.  Very thoughtful.  Not shallow and not for those who like nicely wrapped happy endings.
006114665X|4.0|I very much enjoyed reading this tome, front to back.  It delivered a whole new perspective on what may be the greatest tragedy of the twentieth century.  The book is large because Mr. Clark goes into meticulous detail in describing the role all of the major actors played in causing the war.  He goes back to the original sources to show who knew what, when, about whom, and why they acted or reacted the ways they did.  I found his discussions of the various and often competing centers of power in each capitol particularly interesting.  This is not light reading; the book is written at a very high level, so keep your dictionary handy.  If you really, really want to know why this war happened, read this book.
B00E00PM40|5.0|Love this Movie!!! It's my 3 years old son's favorite movie now. All my family enjoys watching Turbo. My son has 3 Pet Snails thanks to Turbo though haha. Love the soundtrack too. THAT SNAIL IS FAST!!!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|If you are a fan of the original Star Trek, you already know why you need to have this.  If not, then what are you watching?  We were struck by how much more vivid and beautiful the picture is than when the original series aired.  And the new computer effects in place of the old model on a wire are stunning.

006202406X|4.0|If you can't tell by the many negative reviews, some very intense things happen in this book.  Did I enjoy all of those things? No.  But did I feel like I had an emotionally authentic experience?  Yes.<br /><br />Allegiant feels more like a &#34;New Adult&#34; book than &#34;YA&#34; for whatever that's worth.  Roth has matured as a writer while also giving some interesting commentary on both personal growth and societal values.  As the book wound down, I got a feeling of dread because it seemed like there was no way the story could end in any kind of uplifting way while also working through the character development and foreshadowing throughout the series.  Yet, I found a kind of hope for the world and the power of people in the choices that the characters made.  I think the strong reactions from readers are a testament to the solid characters in the series.  Honestly?  More than anything, it made me want to tell my mother that I loved her.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|its a great game full of exciting things to do i give it a five out of five even with tablet game standards
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a fantastic survival tale with a slightly misleading title. In the context of the book the title makes sense, but there are 0 aliens in this book (unless you count the hero, a human, surviving on Mars as an &#34;alien&#34;). I was somewhat leery of a full length book with basically one single protagonist and an antagonist that is the planet, but Mr. Weir pulls it off in spectacular fashion. Whether you are a sci-fi fan or just like a good story, this book is for you. And for the sci-fi fans: this book doesn't have anything &#34;fantastical,&#34; and the tech is absolutely realistic and not too far removed from now. (I forget when the novel is set exactly, but I think it's somewhere in the second half of this century). If I were to compare it with something, I would say &#34;Robinson Crusoe in Space&#34; purely because the main plot is a similar concept to being stranded on a deserted island and trying to survive.<br /><br />This is one of the most enjoyable books I have read in a long time, and not simply one of the most enjoyable sci-fi books I have read.

B00005K3O0|5.0|This movie didn't get the publicity it should have - for anyone losing a loved one, it helps understand grief and loss in this lifetime plus the beyond stage.  It talks in a more real stage of reincarnation using a life experience story.  The soul never dies, it lives on, as in the movie &#34;Ghost&#34; with Patrick Swayze.<br /><br />I feel this movie should have won Oscars for the actors performances, music scores, and interpretation set forth of cultures attempting to open the mind into the world of reincarnation.<br /><br />This is a documentary of that spiritual growth and this movie needs better promotion.<br /><br />I loved it.

Our 2 yr old grandson loves it so much, he can repeat most of the story without help! The fact that there is a simple jingle running through it makes it more fun!  In response to his mom's scolding him about one of his antics, saying &#34;It is not good to do (whatever)&#34; my grandson responded the final line of the book, &#34;It's all good&#34; mommy!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I am not a professional nor a 'semi-professional' movie reviewer. (As some I've read here on Amazon) I simply watch & will tell home viewers what I liked & disliked. &#34;World War Z&#34; (Unrated Version) is a movie I REALLY liked! I had to watch it twice, due to my missing a fact early on in a scene. I thought there was a HUGE error in the movie! LoL! I knew there just could NOT be such, and the movie was so good, so thrilling, so exciting, such down right fun; I fought, 'Why not watch it a second time and see what I missed?&#34; I found it of course, and a few other things for that matter!<br /><br />This movie starts out with a bang, a REAL bang, gets your adrenalin going from the very start. My heart was beating very fast & I was sitting up straight in my chair within the first five minutes! After that it never truly lets up on that constant feeling of a thrilling apocalyptic scare ride! There is a 'Real Story' that coexists with the end-of-the world plot also, no worries there; so this isn't a simple one dimensional story. (Brat Pitt, father, hubby, save the world, blah…blah…blah…No! It is a GOOD Story!) I mean, what more fun is there than watching Brad Pitt running from Zombies? Sigh...<br /><br />The thing that hit me most about this movie was that the idea, the  plot-actually COULD happen! And that scares the living daylights outa me! There are new and unknown viral and bacterial breakouts found around our globe every day/week/month. Check online @ the CDC/NIH! LoL! (No! I am NOT a conspiracy theorist! HA! No worries there! Neither am I one of those 'Survivor' type people-although I know a few!) I am however a Medical Researcher…. This movie IS close enough to reality to be just a tad….. scary! Enjoy it…. (While you can…! Whoo--Whee!)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because although Chromecast does the job it was advertised to do very well, it cannot cast everything to the TV.  Google makes it clear that Netflix, YouTube, Hulu+, Google Play Movies and Music, Pandora, and the Chromecast extension on its Chrome browser are supported.  It would have gotten all 5 stars had more streaming services been supported at the outset.  I'm confident more services will be supported now that Chromecast's popularity has soared.<br /><br />Many reviews already discuss the technical issues in depth.  I was curious to see what all the buzz was about since I don't like to watch movies on a computer monitor. I've never used a Roku, Apple TV, or any other video streaming device.  Setup was quick and painless. It's connected to one of the HDMI inputs on my home theater A/V receiver (rather than to the TV itself). I've been using this for a month.  There were a few hiccups in the video output in the first days of watching Netflix.  The company, however, updated their Android app.  Now the occasional video stuttering is a thing of the past and I can only attribute it to the app update and not to Chromecast itself.<br /><br />For Netflix and YouTube shows that are in HD, video quality is excellent.  I raved about this to my friends.  So guess what.  Now 4 of them got Chromecasts to watch Netflix and YouTube on their big screens because they too had no desire to watch videos on their computer monitors.  For something that works so well that is so inexpensive, there is real value in this small device.  And for only $35, where can you go wrong?
1476733953|4.0|Slight spoiler alert:<br /><br />Really enjoyed the book, even if it was a bit simplistic at times.  Couldn't help but think of Fallout and what might happen when/if the action actually focuses on outside the silo.  That idea alone was enough to hook me, but there was much more to like here.
034553056X|1.0|Usually like John Grisham books.  Couldn't even finish this one.  No suspense, unlikeable characters.  I kept thinking it was going to get better, but it just droned on and on.  Boring.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Can't go wrong with Amon Amarth.  Love Vikings, love metal, love reliable  bands.  They don't change much from album to album, but why would you when every album is so awesome?  Will continue to buy all releases with confidence and anticipation.
B005NFJB2A|5.0|I saw the coming attractions for this movie at a theater but missed the short time it was available at theaters.  I would have loved to see it on the IMAX screen but owning it is better that not seeing it at all.
B00FR0PVSY|5.0|One thing about Lemmy and Motorhead, they just keep doing what works.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I keep loving it.  They haven't let me down yet.  Can't say that for most bands.
0345536886|3.0|Style of writing. Nothing is astonishing about it but enjoyable reading. The author as usual is good at writing. Been reading his other books.
B00EU98VVC|3.0|Love Tyr, but this is not their best.  &#34;Mare of my Night&#34; is simply embarrassing.  I guess Viking metalers, even folkish ones, should probably avoid love and sex themes.  Hopefully they decide to take their next album into a harder direction without some of the cheesy lyrics.  I know, sing about battles and the hardships of Viking life and such!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I just started it but so far I like it we well how it gose.it's fun and so far I like it it got my attention
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Cool game, but it's pretty weird getting used to it. Takes a little time as it's very different from most games, but once you get the flow it's simple and beautiful. Nice graphics and a great idea.
0316067598|5.0|This is a very interesting true story about a Navy SEAL.  It really makes you appreciate the risks that make for our country, most of which remain untold.
B00G15MDI0|5.0|Note: I saw an advanced screening of The Book Thief.<br /><br />The Book Thief is a book that has stuck with me for so many years, there is just something so powerful and raw about Zusak's novel. The Book Thief has to be one of the trickiest books to adapt because it's far from a simple story. The novel is nearly 600 pages and it's main narrator is Death himself commenting on the events of World War II. How could Brian Percival (Downton Abbey) direct such a movie without doing the novel injustice?<br /><br />  The Book Thief is true to it's source material, even though it doesn't maintain all of the major plot events in the novel. The filmmakers rarely utilized Death's narration, so the few times they did use it, it felt a bit awkward and out of place. I didn't get quite the chills from hearing his narration like I did when I had read the book. Despite the unevenness of the narration, The Book Thief really captures the essence of Liesel's story. All of the characters were truly perfectly cast, the dialogue is well done and the film truly captures all of the emotion from Zusak's novel.<br /><br />  Sophie Nelisse is essentially a newcomer to Hollywood and this is her first major role in a movie. I really hope Nelisse wins an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance because it's absolutely unbelieveable. Nelisse's performance is absolutely unbelievable and it's clear to me that Nelisse is an extremely talented actress. Even though Nelisse shares screentime with veterans like Watson and Rush, Nelisse truly steals the show and easily makes viewers fall in love with Liesel.<br /><br />  Both Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson did wonders in The Book Thief, they truly translated the characters from the book into their performances in a flawless manner. Rush and Watson became Rosa and Hans as if it was natural to them, like these parts were made for them.<br /><br />  Rush and Nelisse are a duo that demands the viewers' attention and they truly make this a poignant movie. Their performances carry the film and bring The Book Thief to the next level. If neither Rush nor Nelisse receive Academy Award nominations for their performances, I'll truly be disappointed because their performances are something brilliant. I don't want to discredit Nico Liersch (Rudy) and Ben Schnetzer (Max) because their performances were also unbelieveable. I was just completely caught off guard by Rush, Nelisse, and Watson's extremely memorable acting.<br /><br />  I'm not an extremely emotional movie viewer by any standard, I rarely am moved by movies. The Book Thief really captured me emotionally despite the fact that I knew what would happen next because I had read the book. Despite my knowledge of the plot, the actors fooled me into thinking that maybe it would end differently, maybe my heart wouldn't be stomped on. I was wrong, by the end of The Book Thief I was driven to tears by the movie's incredibly heartbreaking conclusion. I can't remember the last time I had cried this much during a movie, my head ached from crying so much over Zusak's characters.<br /><br />  The Book Thief may not live up to Zusak's novel, but it is one of the best movies I have seen in years. The Book Thief provides an incredible, unique perspective of World War II from a whole new angle. This is the type of movie that will truly stay with viewers long after the credits roll, absolutely unforgettable. I truly hope that The Book Thief will find an audience because it's an extremely well-done film that deserves widespread acclaim. The Book Thief is an absolute must-see and I hope it will continue to strike a chord with audiences everywhere.ovie. Their performances carry the film and bring The Book Thief to the next level.

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bill Bryson is one of the most interesting writers of our time.  Anything he writes will keep you spellbound until you finish.  Amazing the things I learned about that summer but what let up to it.
B007N0REX6|5.0|i love this album. ordered this cheaper than i had seen in store. high quality CD. i will order more! thanks!
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I felt the final book was rushed through, not that I didn't enjoy it.  It just did not read like the other 13 books.
0385302320|5.0|I love this series and have read it several times.  I am eagerly awaiting the new book. I had the books in paperback but bought this to complete the hardback set.
B0037EAJAC|5.0|This movie was bada**.  It was a lot more realistic and believable than &#34;The Last Samurai&#34;.  I felt like I was watching Chess being played.  It was like a more epic version of The Sopranos or The Godfather in Feudal Japan with the family drama between the father and his sons. I can see where the Yakuza gets their mentality. You gotta watch this movie before you die.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is addictive and fun.  I have a hard time putting it down. Bust bubble game out there to play .
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is overly and you  spend countless  hours working the next level. I do wish their were more options to get the helping candies though.
0679805273|1.0|All three books from all three sellers were not as represented in their ads.  NONE of them were &#34;New&#34; as stated.  Two of them had writing in the books and the third was not even the book I ordered.  It was a USED BRITISH (purple) version and not the NEW version shown in the ad.  The first two sellers resolved the issues but the third STILL hasn't given me a refund.  I sent the book back (at the seller's request) and it has been 11 days since it was delivered by the USPS.  DailyDeal USA owes me a total of $12.76.  I am hoping to have them resolve this by Monday.  If not, I will be contacting Amazon.com regarding this matter.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Really excellent Lav mic for the price. I use it for recording cleaner audio from my camera, as well as a mic for my Macbook pro. It is definitely better suited for cameras, but works as an ok mic for the mac.
B0090SI4LU|3.0|the movie is all right , but its' not the same as the book. This is just one that did make the jump from print to screen very well. It;s not to badly done, but just not the same. Definitely read the book before seeing the movie,
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just started playing and I can't stop. Each new level there's a different challenge. Will recommend it to all my family and friends.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I am new at this. I just bought the Kindle so I have to learn the kindle and the games. I'm sure when I get the hang of this game I am going to love it.
B00EPFEZJI|5.0|The definitive return of the Lady Rock & Roll which never stops! this album is pure energy and good vibes.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have only played this a couple of times so far and I don.t get to far with it. I am forever jumping in space but I will learn this game.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Very eloquently written. Each sentence meaningful. A book you can sink your teeth into and enjoy. Just as good as the first book in this series.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Cleverly written. The characters seemed to work well together, although some of the illusions were a bit obvious due to CGI, but hey, altogether, it was great to watch twice!
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|This game is like super Mario bros. TIMES TEN-THOUSAND !!!.  changeable characters, guns, and more fun stuff. The only thing this game needs is more levels.  other than that, this game is the best.
B000IHJ2B8|5.0|In my opinion the best of the Rambo series, though I like the first one a lot too. This becomes a one liner treasure chest: i.e. &#34;I  will find this man.&#34; You won't have to, he'll find you.&#34; and &#34;Who is this man GOD!&#34; &#34;No, God would have mercy.&#34; on and on.<br />This movie should be prescribed therapy after filing your tax return or any time you deal with the government.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|We love tom Selleck and love this series so we have all of the movies we wish they would make some more soon.
1451695195|5.0|I have an older sister with Cancer . A better understanding of Heaven.,, and a vivid account of Heaven and what To look forward to.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the ending was wonderful. Once I started I could barely put it down. Awesome.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Awesome book!  The true honor of serving his country just flowed from the book.  A true hero!  These United States would not be in so much trouble today  If we had more men that were even a fraction of a man that P.O. Luttrell is as well as the rest of the seals and our other special forces!  Thank you for serving and thank you for the REAL story.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I don't like having to get on Facebook to enjoy a game. Not enough instructions to make it fun .Spent more time trying to play, than I did playing. Not for me.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|interesting story of a young man trying to find happiness and improve his self-esteem in the poorer side of an Australian city.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I actually love this book series but the problem I have is that is is suggested as a series for teens.  I for one will not let my teen read these books.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but I see no point in cursing in general and I think an author who curses shows they lack the ability to find better words.  The cursing in mild but for a series for teens again I say it should be excluded.  Also there is a homosexial relationship and insest between brother and sister.  Spoiler alert: it is clear very early on that they aren't actually brother and sister but in the book they don't know it and still want to be boyfriend and girlfriend.<br /><br />The story line is captivating and I as an adult I have enjoyed it.  I would never let my 14 year old read it.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This is a great movie, we enjoyed as much as original movie. highly recommended for any age group to watch
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Awareness of children in danger and how it can affect their adult life. Plus a beautiful love story. Good read
B008MM9630|4.0|I like this game. The only thing is you tend to run out of energy  quickly if you want to play for free.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this dvd a couple years ago and I keep returning to it whenever the weather gets cooler and I need to workout indoors. I personally do not like Jillian's personality; I find her egotistic and annoying. So, I am amazed that I actually like her exercise dvds. I think it is the 3-2-1 that I like; each circuit is a limited time and she breaks it up with different exercises that I am able to complete. In fact, her dvds are the only ones that I use repeatedly. I like the exercises so much that I am able to overlook her personality traits and focus on the workout.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I like that Jillian does not do all the exercises herself. One thing I find irritating on some videos is when the instructor is huffing and puffing while trying to tell how to do the exercises. I wish more instruction would be given on proper form. Once I became familiar with the exercises, I looked up how to do them properly. As for pacing, I do not try to keep up with the pace on the video and prefer to go at my own pace so I can pay attention to the proper form so I do not injure myself.<br /><br />One thing I have difficulty with are the number of exercises requiring the plank position. I injured my wrist and am unable to hold that position.  Several reviews mentioned issues with their knees, but mine is my wrist. Level 1 is manageable but level 2 is too painful. But then, this is a dvd that I am working out to it on my own and I need to use my own judgment as to what I can or cannot do. This is why I am giving a 4 star rather than a 3 star review. In addition, it is also why I am giving a 4 star instead of 5 because when she says that she a 400+ pound people able to do jumping jacks and therefore there is no reason why you [whoever is listening] cannot do jumping jacks.  I find that remark to be irresponsible for a trainer to be giving. (This is my opinion because everyone has different needs and circumstances. Just because some one can do something that does not set the standard for me being able to accomplish that same task.)<br /><br />I have to say that level one of the 30 day shred is one of my favorite routines and I often use it as a warmup before I go for my run.t the standard for me being able to accomplish that same task.)<br /><br />I have to say that level one of the 30 day shred is one of my favorite routines and I often use it as a warmup before I go for my run.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Cute movie! My 9 yr. old nephew loves this movie. I was happy to buy it for him for Christmas. There are too many inappropriate shows on. This was entertaining for the whole family.
B000QE9ERK|2.0|Watched it all, kept my interest throughout until the ending turned to crap.  Polanski bombs on this one.  Do you think Dean Corso was Rosemary's baby?
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's fun, it's really just \\"bejeweled\\" with candy instead of gems. I don't like being asked to purchase coins etc to advance, so I took off two stars.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My kindle is cleaned up and also responds faster then before It's okay it's easy to use I must say that.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app! It is very helpful. It helps to know my battery life. I even love how you can customize the color of the battery.
B00D3Y1C8Y|5.0|Like other reviewers said, there was some slight difficulty with the swords and stand. I was able to get the right sword in easily but had trouble with the left one. It took a while but I managed to get both swords in and the pegs into the figure.<br /><br />Despite that, it's still a very nice figure. It's very detailed and looks great with such a dynamic pose. The paint job is great along with the colors. A real treat for One Piece and Zoro fans. I just love the figure so much that I had to give it 5 stars. I'm definitely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it, just be careful with the initial setup though.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Loved this Empath Anthem, great song. Music. Vocals,  I first heard this on Witches of East End, had to find out more about this artist.  AFTER researching I found Mecca on YouTube. HAD to get her music. I KNOW she is the next Big Thing.
B000003RCY|5.0|Upon first hearing of the Herzeleid CD, I thought it was pretty good.  After the second hearing, I thought it was astounding.  This is as strong a debut album for any band I can recall.  The first 8 tracks alone make for a very worthy album.<br />Sensucht was my first RStein album and I plan on collecting the others as well.  Highly recommended.
B008MM9630|2.0|Fairy Farm Game is an entertaining and relaxing game for the young and young at heart. Nice beautiful pictures, different levels.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|As a lifetime fan of science fiction movies and books, I picked up this DVD (The Darkest Hour) at a bargain price.  However, I should have been more suspicious because I did not recognize any of the actors in this film.  Nevertheless, I did film interesting at times.  This movie revolves around five young people who are visiting Moscow when an attack comes from aliens.  These invaders are unique in that they are electrical creatures who completely destroy anything they touch.  Unlike good science fiction movies, which I love viewing over and over, once is quite enough for this film.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like science fiction movies like Cloverfield you may want to check out this film, but just keep in mind that it is no Star Wars or Star Trek.<br /><br />Rating:  3 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale  (Author:  Never Trust a Politician)
006202406X|1.0|This book was really bad! The writing felt rushed, some characters were undeveloped, Trsi & Tobias' voices were so similar it was hard to tell whose perspective I was reading from chapter to chapter, and don't get me started on the ending!!! It was just BAD. I love the first two books, but I should've stopped at Insurgent & imagined my own ending, or read fan fiction online. Such a disappointment!
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|This is that only book I found that really breaks HTML5 down. Very interesting and downloaded easily to my kindle.
B00CGNYDIE|2.0|that is so stupied and I did'nt even play the game yet but Dp not ccaarree that much.  so ggoooodd bbyye-bbyyee I know that that makes no avenges and cutttt
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing this game, it's challenging and fun.  The downfall is you have to pay to level up a certain levels.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book, in its TV- movie elegance, is quite wonderful. The characters are too wise, too smart, and just perfect. This book is a simple nugget of joy and sadness and deserves to be read.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|So, this is a Superman for this &#34;new generation&#34;, then the writers must think that this new generation is STUPID!  There was almost no character development and a very weak plot.  I won't spoil this for anybody, but the &#34;rules&#34; of Superman and Krytonians were also broken.  What the hell happened to the 'molecule chamber' to take away Zod's superpowers??!!!  Stupid, stupid, stupid.... gone are Richard Donner's brilliant direction and the touch of comedy, and gone are Clark Kent's vulnerabilities and nerdiness.  Very weak plot and horrible story, but that's the direction hollywood seems to be going in - insulting movie goer's intelligence with CGI and extravagant special effects.  Who knows, though?  Maybe it's the fact that the Superman story has been told, re-told, and re-told some more in the form of CW Network Series, &#34;Smallville&#34;, and of course, the &#34;New Adventures of Lois and Clark.&#34;  Maybe movie-goers didn't want to see the full re-boot due to the stories being rehashed and rebooted so many times throughout the decades...  Bottom line, if you were a fan of 1970's and early '80s Superman, you will HATE this movie with a passion and you will keep comparing it to Christopher Reeves and Richard Donner Superman.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Got the whole collection on DVD (finally). Great set of movies for the &#34;trekkies&#34; out there. The only complaint I have is that the artwork is on the clear cover and is really tight on the boxed set. If you remove the plastic cover the set is just in a white box. I think the artwork should be on the box.... not the cover.
B00EI2Y4MQ|5.0|Perfect calculator for my phone.  Great FAOTD.  So glad I got this, does everything I need it to and comes in pink.  Glad to have found a calculator that shows the numbers I put in and shows the whole equation.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am a huge Gone with the Wind fan and have read the book over 20 times, in the book this is the book Melly is reading when Frank, Ashley, and so many other men go out to take care of the men in Shanty town. I had to read the book because I know that the author will put cookies in the book. After reading this book and then Gone with the Wind it has put a new light on Margret Mitchell's book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app I'm on 0.7.6!!!!! The app is the best ever! I also play PC Version none of  the versions have failed to impress me  another thing is 0.8.0 is submitted soon you can only get 0.8.0 if you have 0.7.3 or further sorry
B0092S4WLY|4.0|We all liked this game...me, my husband and 7yr year old daughter. We were hooked for days. The Only drawback is that there are not many levels. More levels added please
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|Because it doesn't fit my Kindle. I talked to one of your customer service people and she said it was the right one for my device but it didn't work.  I have one of the earlier Kindles and need a new charging cord.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Best game has all instruments and song that you could want and has modified things to make your song better also has a instrument that has all and my favourite on the one that has is called all other has my favourite FX echo
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|This is a fun game. A bit weird but after you go along the story kind of makes more sense. A little too much conversation between characters but the scenes make it sometimes a bit more challenging because you first find objects by name then different ones in the same scene by just outline pics. Not sure if this is the type of game for me..a bit elementary. The kids will love it though. Overall it is fun to pass the time when u are bored or want to kill some time. Very colorful. Cannot zoom in which makes it a little harder on aging eyes to find objects as quick. You are timed and do get penalized for too many clicks. But you can try again same scene if you run out of time.
B00GBCMW9S|1.0|It sucks his others where way better maybe 2 or 3 good songs on here but that's it set waste ur money or time
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This is the first book by Denise Grover Swank I've read.  I thought it started off slow but before I realized it, I was engulfed in the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was profoundly affected by this book in two ways--the reality of the story and the amazing beauty of its language. If you write, you must read this book. If you read, you must read this book. I read passages of this book out loud to friends for the sheer poetry of it. Liesel's story underscores the tenacity and fragility of life during war. From the common place to the absurd, you will get to know each character and be sucked into this world until you can't stop reading--wanting to know what happens next. Have patience with the beginning--the convention of Death as narrator seems odd at first. You will also, most assuredly, need a box of tissues in some parts--Liesel's losses will bring out the echo of any losses you may have had in your life. Excellent read. I highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. My kids and I play everyday! It is addicting though but so fun. It is so nice to have a game that everyone can play together.
B006MMX1GU|5.0|wow.....what a great classic album,.,,,you get both vinyl albums on one cd......if you have not bought it , do not hesitate,,,,the mastering is brilliant....the sound is as good as it gets......the songs and arrangement are hippie rock classics,,,,no slop,..its tight and powerful,,,get it,,,
B00AESN8XY|2.0|The Game is great. I'm giving only 2 stars based on availability of updates. The problem is that game updates aren't released on Amazon quickly.  Update 1.6 has been out for months and has been available on IOS and at Google Play. The creator says that the update has been sent to Amazon but that Amazon hasn't been released yet. Unfortunately update 1.7 will be released soon and Amazon customers will be lucky to have gotten the 1.6 update by then, we won't get the 1.7 update when it is released. Ndemic creations is the developer who creates the game and updates for IOS. They have miniclip create the updates for Google play and Amazon. They are slow, and the updates are buggy. Personally I believe that Ndemic should try another Android developer to work on their updates, there are better ones out there.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I'm addicted and am unable to estimate the amount of time I have spent playing this game. I really like the design of the tiles and the increasing difficulty of the games. In my opinion, there are only two flaws: the banjo playing when you win and the lack of fire-breathing dragons. Even so, this mah jong is my favorite.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting to get this game for my Kindle. Now they did and I absolutely love it!!!! Bout time Amazon!
B00G6SDX36|2.0|worse than I expected...it's just another filmsy,  low quality case that i could buy elsewhere for 2 dollars. don't waste your money on it.
B0019IB0II|4.0|Great book in the teaching of how our two hemispheres work. Best part, though, is she gives great strategies as to how to &#34;tend the garden&#34; of your mind.
B007R41E8O|2.0|I just didn't like. It didn't grab my attention from the onset, which is why I always go for the free trial first. Luckily those free trials give you enough time to judge for yourself if you're going to like it or not. Guess it just wasn't gonna happen for me.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Like this game.  You can't play for a long time at one time but it has a variety of things to keep you interested.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I've gotta say, I'm getting a little sick of this &#34;hate on Lady Gaga&#34; bandwagon that seems to be all the rage right now. Sure, I had my doubts going into this album, as Applause didn't really hit me over the head the way I wanted it to, but Gaga has completely won me over with this album. I can't say I was knocked over on the first listen, but when Artpop clicked with me, it clicked big time. And now, it might just be my favorite album she's released. As time goes by, we'll see how that holds up. For now, it's sounding better with every listen.<br /><br />1. Aura - The album kicks off with what almost sounds like an extended intro. The vocal delivery isn't so much singing as it is spitting the lyrics with the type of full-on theatricality and bizzaro-ness we expect from Gaga. It leaves you want just a bit more, which is always a good thing. 9/10<br /><br />2. Venus - This is the album at its most self-referential campiness. I realized from the beginning that this is not going to resonate with all fans, in particular those who want their music a little more &#34;serious.&#34; But really who the hell cares when a track is as fun and interesting as this. A perfect pop song, though I'd advise against making it a single. 10/10<br /><br />3. G.U.Y. - Of the three tracks so far, this sounds the most like a classic Gaga dance track. It definitely shares pieces of past classics like Bad Romance and Poker Face, but the sledgehammer beat, gorgeously anthemic middle eight, and aggressive outro make this an instant standout. The gender politics on display in the lyrics are also refreshingly blunt. It'd make a great single. 10/10<br /><br />4. Sexxx Dreams - Another winner, this piece of plastic funk sounds like it would have been right at home in the 80's. It's one of the breezier pop tracks she's come up with in awhile -- devoid of the artier self-indulgent tendencies that get her in trouble with some listeners. Simply a great chorus, wonderfully delivered verses, and hook upon hook. 10/10<br /><br />5. Jewels n' Drugs - The real oddball of the album, and something that I consider more of a palette cleanser than a real song. Part of the problem is that Gaga herself really isn't on the track as much as her rapper collaborators are. It feels more like a feature, and as such, it's an album lowpoint. What it does do well, though, is split the first suite of four tracks from the three that come next. 7/10<br /><br />6. Manicure - And we're back! Manicure is some kind of weird rock/cheerleader chant hybrid that totally works. I'd say it's the most instantly catchy thing on the album, though I'm not sure it holds up quite as well as the best tracks on here. Still, a total triumph. 9/10<br /><br />7. Do What U Want - The second single, and an excellent choice. What first seems like a kind of dull midtempo r&b track, it took me a few days until this clicked with me. Now, it's one of my favorites. Gaga and R. Kelly's voices blend so well together and the whole thing is so funky and sleek. Brilliant. 10/10<br /><br />8. Artpop - A spacey, dreamy sort of track. It's got a real futuristic, electronic sound to it, I find that, among the bigger moments in the album, it kind of gets lost in the shuffle, but it's definitely a pleasant listen and a nice change of pace. 8/10<br /><br />9. Swine - One of the more experimental tracks on the album, this EDM-influenced hissy-fit of a song took me awhile to get used to (mostly because of those long industrial instrumental breaks), but then I started looking at it as another palette cleanser before the next of the album's song suites and I really appreciated its place in the running order. And Iloved those rocky verses and hiccupy production from the first listen. 9/10<br /><br />10. Donatella - This is where the &#34;fashion&#34; portion of the album kicks in, and of the two tracks referencing this side of Gaga (not my favorite side, btw), this is the weirder and sillier. I'm not in love with the lyrics,which are a sort of obvious satire, but the production's nice enough. 8/10<br /><br />11. Fashion! - This reminds me of 80's era Bowie, and it's all the better for it. I wouldn't have suspected Will-i-Am and David Guetta as producers, as this sounds little like their music. It's laidback, summery and simple. 9/10<br /><br />12. Mary Jane Holland - This is where the album enters its darker, more personal portion, with the first of two tracks concerning drug use. This is a dramatic rock/pop hybrid that reminds me heavily of the late 90's in its alt-pop sound. It's like a mini rock opera, with an amazing breakdown at the middle eight that may just be the album's highest (pun intended) moment. 10/10<br /><br />13. Dope - The album's only real ballad, this Rick Rubin-produced dirge is a haunting, dramatic diary piece theatrical enough to be operatic. Instead of going for precision, though, the production ensures that this is every bit as rough and gritty as the subject matter. 10/10<br /><br />14. Gypsy - My favorite track on the album. I'm a huge fan of Edge Of Glory-style Gaga, mostly because I live for anthemic, driving rock/electronic tracks with a sense of euphoria and bombast. This ticks all those boxes, and adds on top of that some fantastic personal lyrics chronicling the nomadic life of today's popstar. I don't see how anyone could dislike this. 10/10<br /><br />15. Applause - The first single, and oddly enough, not one of the stronger tracks on here. Its sound just kind of feels out of place. Despite its success, I'm not sure it ever really worked as a fully-formed single in its own right, and sounds jarring coming out of the much-bigger Gypsy. Still a great pop song. Just not my favorite. 9/10<br /><br />Album Grade: 9.2/10

B004VF68AQ|4.0|I have to laugh at the reviewers lamenting the long-lost, bad old days of JA's feral junkiedom and proclaiming these men - now middle-aged, comparatively more responsible and (naturally) more reflective than their 20-some-year-younger counterparts - as \\"sellouts\\".<br /><br />To all of you, I ask: are you still doing the same s*** you were doing at age 19, 20 or 21? I'm willing to bet you've got a regular job. Maybe even a family. A house and a car.<br /><br />Well what a SELLOUT you turned out to be! What happened to the crazy, out-of-control youth who got wasted and dressed all wild and talked about revolutions and lived each day walking the razor edge on the precipice of oblivion? What a mainstream sellout you turned out to be...<br /><br />Jane's Addiction are human beings. To expect them to live their lives on some endless, reckless collision course with nihilistic disaster is infantile and hypocritical. To expect their music to summon cultural sea changes for decades on end is absurd. I for one am glad that Steven Perkins, Perry Farrell and Dave Navarro *survived* their attempted self-destruction and are still here to make music as honest, committed and vital as that which graces The Great Escape Artist.<br /><br />Is this album as thrilling, game-changing and life-altering as Nothing's Shocking? Of course not. How the hell could it be? TGEA is a vibrant, gorgeous album made by three (four counting Dave Sitek) weathered, wisened, reflective individuals who have lived through more than any of you armchair critics could ever dream.<br /><br />There's a persistent restlessness in Perry's vocals and lyrics which betray the struggle of a natural born wild spirit trying to walk the line between grown-up sanity and all-out abandon. That's interesting to me. He still looks at the world through wide, wondering (and now, wisened) eyes. Dave Navarro's guitar work on this album is restrained, yet inventive and evocative. I'm thankful he's not still trying to be the Jimmy-Page-on-speed guitarist he was in his late teens. How boring would that be? Steven Perkins has always been the most stable member of JA and his drumming has shadowed this: purposeful, muscular and committed, Perk's sticksmanship is the dependable, rock-solid backbone of the band. Professional but unmistakeably vital.<br /><br />I saw Jane's on this tour and the show was transcendant and moving. They can absolutely still deliver the goods.<br /><br />Stop holding up your favorite musicians to a different standard than you hold yourselves to. Consider who these people are, and what they've done and where they've been, and listen to this album with an open mind.

His relatives accept him back into the family and Barnabas helps them to regain their former status in the community of Collinsport , which is named after the family, when he discovers that his old flame and nemesis is still around and causing problems for his family.

0805086846|5.0|The famous or infamous depending on your ideology historian Howard Zinn is well noted for writing a book that was written from the perspective of minorities and other people which was published in 1980. He was considered to be a radical historian for writing in that style. Dee Brown had written in that style a full decade earlier in his classic work; Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Brown wrote from the perspective of the Native Americans who over the course of four centuries went from masters of North America to displaced and despised survivors eking out a bare existence and living at the whim of their conquerors. Brown’s work was a best seller and helped change how Americans viewed the Native Americans.<br /><br /> He focused on events after 1860 that showed how white American expansion into the frontier zones clashed with the cultures that were already established there. In each case the Native Americans lose the struggle and were displaced and forced to relocate. The concept of Manifest Destiny was at work and that concept did not allow for any other culture to block white Americans from controlling the West. The publication of this book clashed with and still does to this day with elements of America that feel Manifest Destiny and American Imperialism to be acceptable and laudable ideas. For many others, the book shows at what cost those concepts were fulfilled.<br /><br /> The sources Brown used were primary sources which gives the book its realism. Culled from actual accounts filed by army officers who took part in the events depicted in the book as well as accounts from the Native Americans who were also part of the events, the information speaks for itself. Brown gave life to the participants with his outstanding narrative writing skills. The readers couldn’t help but feel the incredible wrongness of the situations that Brown covered. This is an excellent book that has been in continuous print since its initial release. A movie adaptation has been made and it has been translated into 17 languages. It is a must read for any student of the American West.has been translated into 17 languages. It is a must read for any student of the American West.

I devour books that write about the horrors of the holocaust but I've never read a book like this one. I am horrified by this time period in history and the atrocities that people had to endure yet books like this help all of us to look at  horrendous details and remember. We owe it to the lost and to the liberated. I fell in love with these characters in the book and wept at the conclusion. I will long remember 'The Book Thief' and the words that painted this story.

B004LROUW2|1.0|I kept wondering why this book and writer are celebrated, kept thinking I was missing the merit.  Until I finished and was convinced this is a silly book.<br />Mostly the language was my big problem, and this probably owes to the translation. Maybe in his Japanese it works.?....this is too awkward and cliche to tolerate.  I don't believe he's riffing on established American mystery fiction while reading this.  That's a problem as he likely is, (while inhabiting the space<br /> of magical realism.)<br />Some  of the use of language was so  immature I had to scratch my head wondering if he was an adolescent --had he actually had sex ? and known a woman's breasts?.<br />Possibly the most compelling quality was his portraying 1980's Japanese culture as so western and familiar,  like this could be anywhere, it was subtle enough and comfortable enough to question whether this is factual or not.<br />Even the title turns out to be too silly to believe.<br />I would normally try another work by the writer now, but don't think I can .........

This is modern day, thought provoking, personal development thinking.<br />After reading this book you will be more aware of the old saying - \\"Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it\\" - and be much more careful what you wish for.<br />We are in an age of change and metaphysics is bringing science and \\"religion\\" closer every day.<br />Come to this book with an open mind and be prepared to accept the way you think influences your world in ways you can barely imagine.<br />I have read the book once and enjoyed the concepts - I am trained in Hypnosis and NLP so I am already very open to the possibilities - and have completed the first two exercises.<br />Maybe the positive results I received would have happened anyway but my guess is that my mind would not have been attuned to them and I would have missed them in the daily clutter.  The results were significant enough for me to believe they are not just coincidental and that the infinite potentiality of the universe is accessible to all of us.<br />Pam Grout's style is very light and easy to read and her exercises are positive and do get you to focus on what you want which is always a key to achieving results.<br /><br />It's going on my reading list for my Hypnosis and Business clients.<br />Pam Grout has written a great book, easy to read and fun to play the exercises with potentially life changing outcomes.

006202406X|4.0|I absolutely loved Divergent and have read it multiple times. Insurgent was good, but not nearly as good as Divergent. But that is what happens in a series. The first book is always the best. But Allegiant, let me down a little. It isn't a happy ending, but I still think the book was well written. She had two options, the typical happy ever after where readers are left asking for more, wondering, and still living inside the book after it ends, or the way she chose, the way the world is today, not perfectly happy ever after, that leaves you sad, but wraps up the series and book a whole lot better than the happy-ever-after. You don't feel as if you need to know more. It is just done. I'll admit it, I cried, ok, bawled the last 8 chapters. But Tris made a sacrifice, out of love, and instead of cutting down the ending, look at what it teaches teens. It doesn't teach that you should let your brother die because you are mad at him, but to make self-less sacrifices for those you love. Roth has a deeper meaning in these books than just a really good story. They were well written. I cannot wait for the movies!

B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />If there is one parallel between Director Steve McQueen's powerful adaptation of Solomon Northrup's 1853 memoir, '12 Years a Slave', and Spielberg's 'Schindler's List', it's that both are told from the perspective of survivors. Both are exceptions to the rule: in Schindler's list, the 1500 or so Jews who were saved by a German businessmen, of course do not represent the fate of their 6 million co-religionists who were exterminated by the Nazis; and similarly, Northrup was only a handful of kidnapped freedmen turned slaves, who was heard from again. In a sense, the survivor's tale mitigates the horrors somewhat. While the survivor does not represent what happened to the majority, at least the audience can identify with the exceptional rescue --in this way, we can all feel that there's at least some hope, despite all the surrounding darkness.<br /><br />Having read some excerpts from the book the film is based on, it appears that this is a very thorough, truthful adaptation of Solomon Northurp's original account. Director Steve McQueen already established himself as a master of the visual medium in his disappointing, fictional effort, 'Shame', but here, dealing with a compelling true story, McQueen is finally able to shine.<br /><br />The film begins with Northrup already in captivity and we soon flashback to his almost idyllic existence as family man/musician in 1841 Saratoga, New York. The inciting incident of course is his kidnapping after he's conned and drugged by men who misrepresent themselves as businessmen who are in need of a musician to play a limited engagement in Washington, D.C. The break into the Second Act, which constitutes the beginning of Northrup's nightmare, is when he's sold into slavery down in New Orleans. The scene is doubly horrifying as Northrup witnesses the separation of two children from their mother, who are all sold into slavery.<br /><br />The first half of Act II features heightening tension as Northrup is sold to a relatively kind plantation owner, William Ford, who treats him decently and even gives him a violin as a present. Ford recognizes that Northrup is educated (without questioning where he got his education) and allows him to assist in engineering a waterway for transporting logs downstream. Nonetheless, the plantation overseer, the brutal racist Tibeats, resents his boss' special treatment of Northrup. Things come to a head when Northrup beats Tibeats up after the arch racist provokes him. Northrup is tied up and almost lynched but is prevented by the head overseer, who tells Tibeats he can't kill Northrup because Ford will lose his original $400 investment. The big revelation is that even though Ford 'owns' Northrup, he is unable to prevent Tibeats from taking revenge and settles on selling Northrup to another plantation owner, the even more brutal Edwin Epps.<br /><br />Epps is a religious fundamentalist who reads Bible passages to his slaves but also beats them whenever he's in the mood. He's also a hypocrite, as he's sexually infatuated with a young slave, Patsey, who he rapes and will not stop, despite his wife's constant entreaties. The jealous wife takes out all her hatred on poor Patsey too; in one powerful scene, she offers treats to all the slaves, except Patsey, who she strikes in the head in front of her husband, and a horrified Northrup and his fellow slaves.<br /><br />The dark moment of Act II occurs when Patsey obtains a bar of soap from a neighboring plantation at the time when Epps is looking for her. Epps has her stripped and orders Northrup to whip her. When Northrup doesn't whip Patsey full force, Epps takes over and delivers a horrendous beating.<br /><br />Northrup's deliverance occurs in Act III when he meets Bass, a carpenter, who's doing a job for Epps and has abolitionist sentiments. Northrup is reluctant to tell Bass his story since earlier he was betrayed by a white worker on the plantation, after he attempts to convince the man to mail a letter for him, to alert his family and friends in New York. Northrup finally decides to trust Bass and things are set in motion, which leads to his freedom. Perhaps the only real weak spot in this gripping saga is the casting of Brad Pitt as Bass. Pitt is one of the producers of the films and obviously he wanted to get in on the action. But we're too familiar with him as Brad Pitt to believe that this is a 19th century benefactor. An unknown actor here, would have added much more to the film's verisimilitude.<br /><br />Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent in the role of Northrup as he echoes the original author's restrained dignity. Now with a great story to work with, Steve McQueen, has delivered one of the best depictions of the antebellum South to date. The film is a great antidote to those who still yearn for the phony story of the south as depicted in films such as 'Gone With the World'. I wouldn't be surprised if '12 days a Slave' won the Oscar for both Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director at this year's upcoming Academy Awards.pts to convince the man to mail a letter for him, to alert his family and friends in New York.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The book is slow to start ... but I didn't realize how many characters there were to be developed!  Also confusing in the beginning by other characters entering in other chapters and their parts in the plot.  But once that settled down, the book was on a roll and I couldn't bear putting it down! I did get a bit annoyed at times that there was much &#34;dialogue&#34; over absolutely nothing but one can't miss a word for fear of losing an important turn of phrase, a clue, etc.  The author does an excellent job of building suspense which is rare for most female authors, in my humble opinion.  This is a serious &#34;chick&#34; book with many aspects of life/lives delved into; one gets to view the lives and feel some of the shock and emotions that overcome people.  Author does an excellent job of &#34;reeling you in&#34; b/c once hooked, you will not be able to put the book down ... or at least I couldn't!
B00866JL96|5.0|Zac Efron acts in the role of Logan, a veteran Marine returning home after 3 tours. He's shell shocked and edgy, and believes that the picture of a pretty, smiling blonde woman that he found on the ground during a raid gave him luck and protected him from harm. He sets out to find the woman in the picture and ends up working for the woman, played by Taylor Schilling, in her dog kennel business; but he doesn't reveal to her that his presence there is anything more than chance.<br /><br />If you've ever read or watched any Nicholas Sparks novels, you know the two will end up together, but the journey of discovery is always interesting and filled with a few challenges and sub-plots. In this case, the angry aggressive ex-husband, a policeman in the local force, bullies his wife, constantly threatening to take her back to court to win sole custody of their son. The actor who played the young son is delightful, and the grandmother, played by Blythe Danner, is the Rock of Gibraltar, always ready with some pithy comment or observation. I want to be just like her when I'm older - oh wait I AM older :)<br /><br />The chemistry between Zac and Taylor is palpable and beautiful, as are the wonderful settings in the old home and grounds surrounding the family business. I don't know whether the same cinematographer works on all Sparks' movies, but there always seems to be an ethereal light and glow that signifies happiness, and this film is no exception. Some of the scenes in early morning and late afternoon light are just breathtaking.<br /><br />Without providing any plot spoilers, I'll just say that the plot is interesting and believable and the characters are well-cast. The plot rises to a dramatic arc, leaving you wondering whether a happy ending will occur... I won't say whether or not that happens though.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This is one of my favorite films!  The Blu-ray is an absolute must.  A lush, gorgeous film with a lovely story.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie. Both my husband and I enjoyed it which doesn't always happen. Kept our interest, suspenseful and even though it was based on a true story we didn't know much about it before.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|Loved this movie!!!  If you liked the Men in Black movies you will like this one.  Have owned it for about 3 weeks and have watched it 10 times.  My 14 year old daughter though it was hilarious!
B007BLCGNU|4.0|This movie tells Hoover's story from the time he was a young agent until his death, how he rose to head the FBI and all the changes he made.  It exposes the real Hoover as opposed to the public persona.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|The worst of the 3 Iron Mans.  I have been a comic collector and enjoyed the other movies developed from comics. They completely killed the character of Mandarin from what he was in the comics.  The placed more of the hero factor on Pepper.  It seems that the Directors and screenwriters need to research the comics before trying to do another on of these.  I was really disappointed!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is the story of a B-17 pilot and a ME-109 fighter pilot.  It goes into great detail of how things were in Germany and the Luftwaffe during the war.  If you are interested in WWII this is a must read whether you care about aviation or not.<br /><br />The author started a newsletter in high school which evolved into a magazine while he was in college.  One grandfather was a B-17 gunner and the other was a Marine in the South Pacific so he grew up hearing their war stories.  That's what he wrote about in his magazine.  He lived in a very black and white world, we were the good guys and &#34;they&#34; were bad, and his number one rule at the magazine was that no stories would be told from the enemy's viewpoint.  He happened upon a story that had to be told but the American B-17 pilot wouldn't tell him everything until he interviewed the German fighter pilot involved.  Reluctantly the author agreed.  During his research he traveled to Germany and later went on combat patrols with Americans servicemen.  He found out that life isn't quite so simple.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is a lot of fun. Keeps your mind off life for awhile. I do wish it would either give you more lives to start with or give them to you more often. I only get to play a little at a time because life is just so hard and busy.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|The sex is &#34;suggested&#34; but it doesn't take much imagination to know what is going on.  In this day with so much hard core porn available at a mouse click &#34;Deep Throat&#34; might seem relatively tame by comparison but at the time it was truly groundbreaking.  This movie though is the story of Linda Lovelace, her stage name, and not a porno.  It shows how she was used and abused before finally quitting the business and resuming a normal life.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I saw no flaws with this game. It is very fun and addicting,and yes you get a jetpack. I beat this game many times, but its still fun! :D reccomend to any one who has a kindle!
B005IGVYUG|5.0|He is what he is.  Saw him on Lederman, bought the album.<br />Enjoy his type of music.  He is one of a kind.
0142410705|5.0|Lovely story. Very unique and insightful. Colin is a very relatable character and his plight only makes him more endearing. Would definitely suggest it to a friend.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I was super excited to use this.app and it wont install! so if it works great like the reviews say I wouldn't know.
B00GINENG0|5.0|By far the most cool,fun ,little kid friendly,game I have ever played. It is also vary addictive and I highly recommend this game.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game so far! Love the combination of an adventure with puzzles and HOG. Just wish I could play longer without my energy running out--its too tempting to spwnd money to keep playing (but that's what they want you to do so I guess it does that job well). 4 stars for having to spend money/wait around for energy... if I didn't it would be 5!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It answered my questions fast and to the point. What else can I say... get it and you'll learn more about Kindle publishing. That's the goal right?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it for all that it offers like the different reading plans and different languages and Bible versions. I have Japanese friends who also like it. It's really wonderful and I'd recommend it to anyone.
6305428050|5.0|This is one of the best ever family movies. I this this is where Elizabeth Shue got her start and I have like her acting ever since.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is a great book that highlights the issues that face IT dept. The ideas shared in this book could easily be translated into any IT dept regardless of industry.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Good acting that brings the continued story alive and the settings are real as well; not back lot studio setup stuff. Hurry season two!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ok so I loved the first two books but I hate the way this ended... I looked forward to a conclusion where tris finally gets what she wanted, what she fought for. I was very disappointed. Just my opinion I'm sure others will love the way it ends but I wish I stopped reading at book two.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Nice visuals, nice length of play, no hidden objects just puzzles to solve.  By the time you are done you will have covered quite a few screens, so it's good exercise for the spatially challenged - even when you look at the master map you find yourself muttering &#34;one back, two left,one up, one right, two up&#34; etc.  Pleasant story-line for kids - you are fixing something important but there is no fear or nasty stuff involved.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|This move is great! Loved seeing Helen Mirren in action. Great cast, as good or better than the first movie.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|My 10-year-old daughter and I had a great time with this one.  Nice visuals.  Nice range of problems to solve.  Hints if you get stuck.  No hidden objects, just puzzles to solve.  Long enough to make you feel like you've had a nice adventure - we played it a bit a day for a little goofy together time and it lasted more than a week.  And she is going back through it again on her own because it is complex enough that you forget where you went to get what or how to make sense of the clues.  I also like that there is nothing going on that could feed a nightmare or make anyone feel bad.  Well, okay, the evil sorceress has a nasty laugh, but you take care of that by the time you are done.
B00846REIS|5.0|Good read an loved the characters an how the book moved .  Could read this book over an over loved it
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|I just love Enya, another great CD. Her voice, the music just blends together so well. A Wonderful CD to kick back to, and relax.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|Just one of the best series written for TV, ever. Based on an Israeli series, I believe. Dramatic, engaging, insightful, and always involving. Therapeutic. Not for anyone in denial about the human condition. You will be sorry when its over.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|rereading.....read last June 2012 & 11-16-13<br /><br />Wow, reading this the second time and for some reason I didn't think Maddox was as bad as I thought he was. Abbi and Travis definitely deserved each other since they both drove me up the wall between their drama and crazy antics with one another. I went back and updated my reading status for notes later & post on Amazon also. Fixing to start reading Walking Disaster......
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Reads like a thriller. And of course, like most books, better than the movie. Couldn't put it down till it was over.
1936719010|5.0|This book is short and poignant in it's message. I read it in one sitting, I definitely recommend it to anybody trying to demystify accomplishment and it's unattainability.
B00B1MJ02K|4.0|Andrea does another excellent job but was a little disappointed when they cut out some songs as in the one shown on TV. Wanted the uncut one.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Not quite as brilliant as the first two installments, but plenty of hilarious episodes nonetheless.  Bridget Jones fans will enjoy it.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|This app is functional but has some performance issues. I have a Kindle Fire HD and video skips a lot. Video quality or network speed don't seem to matter, the app still stutters at odd intervals. Missing chat features.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series. I cant wait for the next one already. I was wrapped up in this world all weekend.
B0050I978S|4.0|Arcadia is a land being taken over by creatures called Thanatos. People known as Purifiers are the only known defense against them. However, there are only a few of them and the Thanatos are multiplying and becoming even more troublesome. The Purifiers must work together with their allies and find a way to stop the Thanatos.<br /><br />This is such a good show. The characters and story line are interesting. Everything in the anime is so colorful. The artwork is beautiful. Although after a few episodes I could guess the ending, knowing the title and all. Although, I already guessed how it would end, I was still disappointed that I was right with the ending. I wished it ended differently, which is why I gave it 4 stars.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My son loves this game. He played it so much and so often that I think he passed it in a week. There has been no issues with the game or the app.
B00BC5I6Q2|3.0|I love this series! I'm so glad I can watch it again whenever I want to be completely disturbed by cut-throat politicos (5 stars). My only complaint is the packaging. It looks pretty, but the DVDs get scratched removing them from the tight cardboard sleeves (1 star). I purchased a really ugly six disc case to keep the DVDs from getting more scratches, but It's disappointing when the manufacturers screw up the packaging design so badly.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I've got this on all my android devices and can't get enough of it. You don't have to spend money to advance which is refreshing.
B00E9ZATJO|1.0|Bad issue. I have returned this movie and received a second one with identical problems. The movie stalls in several places and with captioning off, there are strange extra big, partial subtitles that appear and the few words stay long after the scene is over. This is a cute movie. It's not as clever as &#34;Monsters, Inc.&#34;, but they are trying to give the characters a backstory not dazzle us with a different take on things that go bump in the night. I'm going to wait for a new release of this movie and try to buy it again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You an always have fun when your are playing this game. Everyday you get money or like a token. I would get this game there are new places for you to run every time you upgrade the game. This game is so much fun! Get this game for me! Thank you hope you like it.
145210655X|5.0|Very creative.  It was a father's day present from my 6 and 8 year-olds. Jeffrey Brown's other writings are great too.
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|Simply a great box set, and a great value for the dollar.  I had all of them on vinyl back in the day, now I can hear distortion in clarity on the CD's.  Also, with the cloud I get the free downloads.  I enjoy this a ton
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book this much in ages.  Marvellous.  I could not put it down and I am ready to start re-reading it right away.
B002LANLDK|5.0|One of the best Fast and Furious movies made yet. I know they will continue to get better. But, this one tops the cake.
B000002J0G|5.0|It’s been a long time since I listened to “Low”, but I’ve been checking out a lot of Testament lately after the release of their live album, “Dark Roots of Thrash”.  All I can say is….wow!  I remember liking this album a lot when it came out, but having neglected it for so long, I had no idea what a powerful, well-written, absolute riff-laden album it actually was.  The thing is, metal was weird when this came out in 1994.  After Metallica went commercial with the Black Album in ’91, Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies, Testament, and Anthrax, to name just a few, dropped their all-out thrash approaches and adopted simpler styles more rooted in hard rock or alternative.  Megadeth had some success with it, Anthrax got their whole sound confused, and Suicidal and Testament reverted to their heavier sound after failing to make much of an impact on the radio.  For Testament, “Low” was a return to form, a scorching blast of thrash metal, but with a new groove sensibility in the wake of successful albums by Pantera and Machine Head.  It delivers on every front.  Chuck Billy’s vocals return to the roar of the first several albums after attempting to soften things up on “The Ritual”.  Eric Peterson serves up one of his most potent collections of heavy, galloping riffs song-for-song, ignoring the waning popularity of thrash and concentrating on writing quality songs.  The production is also better than the two previous albums, especially the drum sound, which is much improved over “Souls of Black” and “The Ritual”.  It sucks that as good as this album is, it’s basically their refusal to play mainstream, hit-song hard rock that lost them their record deal after “Low” and almost ended the band altogether.  As far as the Testament discography goes, you won’t find a more solid all-around album.  I put it right up there with the first two albums, “The Gathering”, and “Dark Roots of Earth”, but I know that’s debatable.  I don’t really think Testament ever did a bad album, but the quality of the songs definitely suffered on “Souls of Black” and “The Ritual”.  I’m not even overly fond of “Practice What You Preach”, but it’s no doubt a strong album.  Back to the point, “Low” holds up extremely well all these years later, and it’s a shame they don’t really play any of it live anymore.  It’s a sterling example of what Testament is capable of.think Testament ever did a bad album, but the quality of the songs definitely suffered on “Souls of Black” and “The Ritual”.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|very helpful. shows battery life. approx hours of use on the Internet or music or reading. tells me the health of my battery which is nice cause my old kindle 's battery wore out and I didn't know why.<br />overall good app. annoyingly opens only sometime when u plug it in. cant figure out why....
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I love this game.  The idea of a short tap for a hop and a long hold for a spin is brilliant.  The coin trail is a great way to show you what the ideal path is.  The cane is great, both a way to hang on and slide down the rails and as a weapon to whap the apple thief when he gets within arm's reach (which slows him down).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just love it! Can't wait for more fun...kept me thinking. It took me awhile too figure out what to do but once I did it was very entertaining
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This is life changing book. I wish I had read it 20 years ago.<br />I saw a TED video from Shawn and it was a lot of fun. The book is even better.
B001SKB1Y0|1.0|The greatest dissappointments of all time. This time around Woody cannot even relate to the Spainish ambience.  Music selection is the greatest dissapointment... The plot and the dialogues are forced and unnatural...  Artificially created emotions with horendous music selection.  As much as his music selection was the best ever in Midnight in Paris, this one was the most awful.... Spain without flamenco ( even in Barcelona) is like guitar wtihout the strings...  Woody does not undertand spaniard mentality.  he can only rellate to upper class americans from Manhattan... That is what he does the best... Crimes and misdemeanors, midnight in paris by far his best.<br />Woody, do what you can, not what you want!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Everyone loves Facebook lol haven't seen how it's is on the kindle yet because I loaded it on for my daughter her kindle fire is for Christmas but I sure it's great it's Facebook 😃
B004W648Y2|5.0|This 2 CD deluxe set includes the Mono and Stereo versions of Arthur along with some BBC, remixes, outtakes, and bonus tracks.<br /><br />Arthur itself is a deeper push by Ray Davies into what has become his niche, Englishness. Ever since &#34;A Well Respected Man&#34;, Ray has written songs about English life and society. Arthur takes that of &#34;Village Green&#34; and adds a darker side to this Englishness that really hasn't been heard since &#34;Big Black Smoke&#34; and &#34;Dead End Street&#34;. Arthur depicts English society through the eyes of Arthur from pre-war England to current times (for the album that is: 1969). It is about English pride, war, personal shangri-la's, moving to Australia, and a poor man/woman's life and thoughts.<br /><br />It is an interesting album, a concept at that. Far from what anyone was doing in 1969 and far from the rock n roll rough and tough attitude. One can say the Kinks were ahead of its time or even before its time. Nonetheless though the album sold poorly in the late 1960s it has become one of their best and is treasured amongst fans.<br /><br />This 2 CD set is the best out there. The songs are remastered and sound better than they ever could be...and that's coming from a vinyl enthusiast. It is pricey for Americans for it is pressed in the EU but well worth it for Kinks fans. The packaging is subperb and the booklet is very informative. Each CD matches the likeliness of the original PYE labels from 1969. Packaged well, sounds beautiful and well worth the money.<br /><br />Now who is this album for? If you only know the Kinks for &#34;You Really Got Me&#34; and &#34;All Day and All of the Night&#34; then I recommend listening to Kink Kronicles first to get the whole array of the Kink sound. If you like that give Arthur a try.<br /><br />Oh by the way...if you do like Arthur after buying it and hearing it for the first time....welcome to the Kinkdom.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The hotties game of today I love until I get stuck lol I loaded it on my daughters kindle which is for Christmas but I know she love it she plays it on her laptop all the time!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I read the book and was very excited when this was picked up by HBO.<br /><br />I really think they did a good job sticking with the story. My husband was not excited to watch it and thought it was going to be lame but quickly got addicted and became a fan!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Ok my daughter loves uno and I have it on my iPad and I love it so much also we have the card game but now when she want to play you don't have to wait to play it's always someone ready for the challenge!
0553593714|5.0|I have never read anything like this! I am an avid reader but mostly of biographies and historical fiction dealing with women.<br /><br />This is so far from my norm but I kept hearing about it so I gave it a try. I could not put it down. I'm currently on the fourth book and my house work has suffered greatly!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Have played its for my daughters kindle fire for Christmas she will love she love these characters lol it's free!
B00B1DC2FQ|5.0|bought this for my grandson for his birthday.. it is well constructed and the  coloring is well done. he said it looked like the one  in  the book at school.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughters favorite game we haven't played on the kindle yet because it's her Christmas gift but it's one of her favorite she will be please!
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|You can really notice the difference between Sanderson's and Jordan's writing. But hey, you gotta read to the end. Some anachronistic choice of words. Sometimes Sanderson inserts stuff that is almost pure Sanderson, like a couple of characters that i felt were designed by him. Overall, it reads more like Mistborn or Way of Kings rather than WoT.
B009RH973I|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my daughter it beautiful and we love pink and it fits the kindle fire perfect and very stylus a must have for and diva😊
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was as enjoyable as the first two seasons.  Some of the characters mature and others well..... you will have to watch it!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I knew someone's husband who is interested in<br />special effect graphic action movie, and so I gave<br />&#34;Inception (Two-Disc Edition (Blue-ray) as a gift.<br />In this way he could do what he love. I appreciate<br />his passion. We need more people like that in film<br />industry.<br /><br />I had to watch science fiction because it was so boring<br /><br />T. M.
B00DV9QHB8|5.0|Amazing Music and the finest artist!!!!!! The world is lucky to have Lang Lang as he promotes music to all ages
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is awesome - no resolution issues, perfect clear HD picture, no audio sync problems, NONE of the usual computer-to-tv video issues these inexpensive devices often pose. Works exactly the way it's supposed to and the compact design is efficient for TVs in tight spaces. Couldn't be more satisfied.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Having previously read A Time to Kill it was good to revisit the town and characters from that wonderful story.  This book is another of John Gresham best.  It is a must read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loves this book. It was a very hands on book and a game changer for those on the fence of law of attraction. I will be buying a hard copy to keep with me at all times. Thanks, Pam!
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Received it today and listened eagerly. I would listen to Jonathan sing the weather forecast. He is just wonderful.his solos are great, I hope that the fact that they had solos means that Jonathan will move on to more operatic venues, his voice is a true gift. they are great together anyway. I recommend Perhaps Love to anyone. The love songs are great, and the solos too. I will be buying more CDs as they make the perfect Xmas present for my friends and family.  I Love Jonathan!!!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Kept me glued to it all throughout the pages.<br />Beautiful depicting the surroundings. I'm not usually patient enough to read all non dialogue &#34; paragraphs, this book made me to, as each scene was set for something amazing to happen.<br />And it did, to the end. My mind is rushing still to find a sequel, what would I want to do with the characters ? It's so much to say. I love it.
B0037QGS0A|4.0|I liked the suspense good acting the nudity of both stars all of this made it worth my time enjoyable
B00DY951RQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this compilations of alternate takes and take-outs of two of Dylan's lesser liked albums. I also love the live Isle of Wight concert.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Have you ever read a book where every single sentence was a work of art? That's Gone Girl. I've heard a lot of people say they had a hard time getting into it so I thought it would be confusing and drab like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. But no. I was sucked in from the first sentence and couldn't stop reading until I'd seen the last one. Reading this book is not just a way to pass time. It's an experience.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|AWESOME... Any movie with the Rock is good enough to watch....I just wish, the prices were cheaper at Amazon for movies or more could be moved into the Prime free section....
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I enjoyed reading this, though not as much as I would have if I was a Harry Potter fan or a reader of fanfic. I did like the relationships between Cath and her friends at school and I thought her hardships with her family were realistic. But something about her rubbed me the wrong way. She just wasn't very likeable. I actually liked the roommate better than Cath. Not that I have to like a character to like a book. It's still a 5-star read for me because it entertained me the whole way through. I just wish I had been able to relate more to Cath.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|I liked it the story line was interesting so we're the puzzles. Though it could have been longer. But overall I enjoyed it.
B000B0WO0I|1.0|One good song threw the CD away one of the worst purchases I've had.  Love the Artist not the songs
B00GB7GX20|5.0|Celine never disappoints and continues to get better!!  Her voice adapts to all notes and this CD has a variety of songs showing them off!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love game really passes the time and great graphics keep up the good work hope to see more games in the future
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was recommended to me by my brother and his wife as a book on tape.<br />I downloaded it to my kindle and loved it so much I read it twice!
B005CRQ3LG|5.0|my grandson is 22 months and loved talking about the fish in this story...pictures are fun and the story is sweet! we recommend it!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Timeless classic. A MUST read if you haven't already. I downloaded it onto my kindle and have it in my cloud in case I want to refer back to it - or read it again. . .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super addicting!  Challenging puzzle-type game where you try to link 4 or 5 like-pieces of candy together to create special pieces that have special powers.  Love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is very nice, sometimes i get irritated whith adds popping up, but i recommend if your going to get a horse game get this one!#1 app
B000GLKLCK|5.0|I am not an expert on classical music. but  i have good ear. this cd. sounds good. the Mozart piano concert is this kind of music than you can hear over and over again. the quality of the sound is almost perfect and the interpretation is elegant, refine, and nostalgic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome you should get it the graphics are really cool and the money is worth it you Haft to get the game if you like building or crafting
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Husband writes: It's just not fair, I don't watch many TV 'shows,' and recently watched the pilot episode after hearing all the buzz about the series finale.  Well crud, got hooked and am buying it up season by season.  Expensive, but this is now my meth addiction.  Buyer beware - stay away or suffer the same.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|There are a lot of gun apps to choose from but I think this is by far one of the best. It has excellent graphics, a good variety of guns and attachments, and overall it's an incredible app. There are really cool options that make the experience even better. You can activate smoke, simulated jams and can select unlimited ammo. I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys  learning about the history of WWII or any other gun fans.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Didn't receive Amazon coins either.    I really don't like rating games until I have played them for more than a couple of hours, but even using 'remind me later' it was still asking, so....  Pretty easy to learn. When you first start you are offered a discount to buy crowns. I did and was kicked offline. When I went back to the game, my crowns weren't there. I went to my email and had confirmation of the purchase but still haven't seen them.    Edit 11/17: Reviewed the game and still get the message to review the game...  Got a pop-up that there was a problem and to reinstall.  Hope this helps get my crowns.    Edit 11/20: Still haven't received the crowns.  Couldn't get the game to work at all yesterday.  I got kicked back to my Kindle screen every time.  Tried the uninstall/reinstall trick and still got kicked off.  I will try again tonight, but this is not looking good.  If I can't get online to play, what's the point of having a game?  Updates to come.    Edit 11/24: Game works, but haven't gotten my crowns. If anyone knows how I can get my crowns, please reply.  Thanks.    You have to buy crowns to get dragons.  There is no way to get 750 crown in the first few levels to buy the first dragon unless you pay for it.  I really dislike games that force you to pay for something that is needed.  Since the first dragon costs so much, the player should be given enough coins to cover the purchase.  If they run out before the dragon can be accessed, then it is their fault, but you have to give us a fighting chance!    Edit 8/28: I went online and contacted Zynga.  They were more than helpful and I have gotten my crowns.  I really like this game!  Very addictive since they added Alliances.  You can chat with other players in your group, who can help you with the needed items to finish quests or orders.  Updates can be a headache, until all the bugs are smoothed out, but the developers are very customer-orientated.  Love the game, two thumbs up from me!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best, most realistic, deer hunting game ever!!  I've been waiting for these kind of games for so long.
B00CSYR432|4.0|This is a present for my nieces and nephews. They enjoy Miyazaki films, because they learn from them and they are never boring.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is amazing because it gives me something to do when I'm boared and is really fun to play
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a fun game and addicting everyone I know loves it so get this game for every age too
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book fascinated me in many ways. Before reading it, I’d never had an understanding of how chaotic life must have been in ancient Israel. Take the money changers as an example. I never understood why they were exchanging money (even though I took a course on the New Testament in college), or how corrupt the clergy were. Thousands of years later, the practice of extorting money from commoners (such as my aunt) to gain plenary indulgence today on earth for admittance into heaven later would continue. My aunt is long dead, as are the clergymen who took her money to line their pockets and festoon their churches. If that wasn’t enough, I see now why independent, liberal leaning feminists have a clear distaste for Paul, formerly known as Saul. He indeed took on the persona of rock star (we can call him a rock star of the ages), who made himself into a pillar of the Catholic church yet wasn’t even alive when Jesus the prophet walked, talked and died on earth. How Paul managed to turn everything Jesus the prophet did upside down is beyond me. It reminded me of all the times I remember men turning things upside down to suit their own egos. I believe, though, that Paul’s sleight of hand left me  scarred. The fact that I still like men after reading this book is the most stunning miracle of them all. This book may have just as easily been titled &#34;Men and Their Egos.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game but it is to addictive. It's hard to stop playing. That's the only bad thing about it.
B009HSPODE|2.0|These stories were boring, pointless accounts of indifferent people in humdrum locations. The writing style is decent, but the message was nil, the entertainment value negligible. The N Prize committee must have seen something more in them  - I surely didn't.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think it is th best hunting game ever. You get to by guns you can kill other animals like wolves

B001OFJPIS|2.0|predictable, and they couldnt think of any new jokes from the first one. i must admit we only watched the first hour though. . maybe it got better.
B00G727J7C|5.0|When Amazon posted this as a recommendation for my musical tastes, I was reluctant.  I didn't check this out until after the 'Extra' was released.  Then I scanned through the songs and was pleasantly blown away!  A reviewer had said that The Next Day was Bowie doing Bowie and I whole heartedly agree!  Bowie is in his mid 60's now and uses it to his best advantage.  Some songs, you hear it in his voice, yet he also reaches for those high notes that we remember and hits them! The music is fantastic: it's as if he has taken everything he's learned over the years, even the Deram recordings, and painted us a mosaic in musical form, every aspect starting with the doo wop of the 50's and right on up to the latest electronica.  Favorite songs?  I downloaded the music so don't have the back cover to look at, but take your pick, they are all infectious, but in a good way!  The ten minute remix is also fun to listen to.  The cover is that of the Heroes album with a white square over it with The Next Day printed on it.  I'll have to dig out my old copy of Heroes to see if there is some sort of pattern going on here, but for right now, this is all the Bowie we'll need!  .
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Works perfectly with the flashlight coming right on. Very nice feature with the screen lighting that you can set the color of. And for free!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|.  I saw the concert at the Frank Sinatra school in NY via Yahoo and Paul and his band just seem to be in simpatico.  They performed 3 tracks from this album at that show and the kids were great with their questions and admiration for Our Paul.  There are alot of strong songs on this album, and surprise, a bonus track if you wait about 45 seconds after the disc 'ends'.<br /><br />Paul's' voice does show it's age at times, which is kind of refreshing: he's comfortable in his own skin and 'gets by with a little help from his new friends.'  One of the stores offered a bonus DVD with this, but i never really watch those except to preview them, so...there you are.  New, Queenie Eye, Everybody Out there, Save us and Alligator are the first impression, stand out tracks for me.
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|Try it and you will surely like it. Does all that you want it to do. Great tool to manage apps!
B00F3VOL38|5.0|I had an old bootleg called 14 Unreleased Songs by the Beatles, which turned out to be from the BBC.  The first set of BBC records was just a blast to listen to.  They follow the same format here with song intros, banter with the announcer with the same charm that captivated us when they came here to America.  I must say that Brian Matthews seems alot more comfortable with the boys than the other announcer on Disc one of this set, so that was sort of a put off, but the extensive bonus interviews at the tail of each disc were also fun to listen to.<br />The sound quality is somewhat superior, yet, as the difference between analog and digital, some songs seem to lack the warmth, although, it could also be too much treble.  Please Note that if you are a young listener or prefer a 'certain' period as opposed to the Beatlemania days , this may not be for you.  But for the rest of us, this is the last in this series, according to the producers of this set.  The original Beeb recordings were also 'remastered' with new bits put in between songs.  Good Show all!

B009E9QOEO|5.0|Did Led Zeppelin ever do a bad concert?  Don't tell me, i don't want to know.  I own the commercially released live concerts and each one has something different.  This has the history and the power to back it up.  Older, they have never sounded better!  Oh, and I understand that Page is re remastering the catalog, with previously unreleased songs......sigh...we'll buy them....AGAIN!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its a pretty addicting game, very enjoyable. candy crush is finally available for the kindle fire. good good good<br />good
0399157573|5.0|I'd like to start off by saying I'm a 28 year old male who doesn't do much reading unless it's for school or work.  A friend of mine recommended the Scarpetta series to me a few months ago while we were having a discussion about all the different crime shows on TV.  She had told me that Patricia Cornwell was the one who influenced all of those shows.  Like most long-term series I was a little reluctant to check them out this late in the game (I'm embarrassed to admit how many &#34;great&#34; television shows I missed because of the mere fact that I was way behind) but I decided to give this a shot anyway and now I'm a believer.  I started reading this the other day and haven't been able to put it down.  You don't have to start from the beginning of the series.  Cornwell is both suspenseful and informative, and I'm planning on going back and reading other titles in the Scarpetta series.  Highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting epic and fun I also like the mini games within the game...like the mini bosses.I really really like it ll
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Of the game.  Totally addicted to it.  My son loves to play as well.  It is easy for him to follow along.

B0009A21R6|5.0|I'm currently listening to this CD for the 3rd time having received it just yesterday evening.  The use of rear channels is spectacular. The rear channels are not just for ambient noise.  There is a lot of volume back there.  Each song has something unique to offer for your listening enjoyment.  I assumed that I'd appreciate Money for Nothing the most but the other songs on the CD lend themselves to more rear channel mixing.  Don't get me wrong, Money for Nothing is still very good, just that the other songs shine as well or better.  I'm enjoying the 5.1 aspect so much that I've yet to listen to the 2 channel CD layer.  I do enjoy accurate music reproduction but with this SACD I'm justifying the money I spent on my surround system :)  My system is fairly accurate: Oppo Blu-Ray, B&W monitors for front, NHT center and rears, Outlaw Pre/pro with 265W/ch Outlaw 5-channel amp, NHT dual driver sub with 500W amp.

B00FM8WGK2|5.0|Oh my ghoul!! What an amazing Jinifire. Usually I start with describing the doll, but this time I am gonna skip to the singular most amazing feature in my opinion.....her shoes. These kicks are absolutely amazing both in style and color. They are a pearlized/metallic jade green, and the heels are perfect little miniature foo dogs!!  Jinifire herself is goregeous as well. Her hair is very long and pulled back from her face. It has two shades of green (one is just a tiny little bit lighter) and black. The two vary similar shades of green in her hair provide an awesome depth and dimension to it. Her eyeshadow is also done in  two shades of green. This looks beautiful against her metallic gold skin. Her lips are a very pretty berry/maroon shade and have almost a geisha like shape to them. She wears red earrings that look like paper lanterns.  Her blouse is a silky material with a wraparound neckline. To me it looks the same shape as the top of a traditional cheongsam dress. It is light aqua with what looks to be a print of purple flames. The trim is black with gold metallic designs printed on it.  Her pants are red metallic with a black and gold section sewn onto the very bottom of the pantleg. She has a beautiful red fan shaped purse with a gold painted accents and a black strap. She also has a red plastic folder/portfolio with a golden dragon embossed on the front. She wears a small jade green bracelet (the same plastic as her shoes) on her left wrist. She comes with a booklet, It is done in the style of a datebook/calendar. I was also happy to see that she comes with a stand and a brush. In this version she seems to have a little more modern/young edge to her and is a little less formal. I love the old version of Jinifire, and think this version holds its own too. Overall, I love this doll!!
B009XWD02G|5.0|Allowed downloading music only available on cassette tape and then loading onto hard drive in my Lincoln MkS after burning to CD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Once you start playing this game its very hard to put it down. Gotta have that one more try, one more try, ONE MORE TRY!! Next thing you know, it's 3am!
B00064ADR0|3.0|I mostly agree with the other three star review. This first track is top of the the line but IMO it stands alone. Frankenstein is of poor sound quality and I'm in no hurry to listen to much of it again. Maybe it will be sold for a couple dollars,
B00011ZBXO|5.0|Very happy w/this Movie, has been an interesting add to the book, and correspondence w/Michael.  There's something to be said about our fascination with fantastical horrific occurrences and our need to learn as much as we can about it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A wonderful story with depth and emotion. Using Death as the narrator was brilliant. The characters were all so vivid and real - the story was truly compelling. I couldn't put it down.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I waited for this on kindle I even downloaded an older version on my kindle because I could not wait any longer for this. But now its here and I love the multiplayer.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|What can I say, Lee Child is an amazing writer and Jack is such a great character.  Better than the previous book too!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|cant stop playing it. love it. have it on my kindle and samsung s4. I'm on level100, lot of sweat and hard work put in lol
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Ridiculous. I just couldn't get into this at all. I'm not even sure why as I generally like this type of game.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Once I started I couldn't put the book down! While it is definitely more sexual and more graphic than some of he other books the stories of love, loss and tragedy Lulu and her daughter Violet endure are truly touching. I am a big fan of Amy Tan and had been anticipating reading this book and this book does not disappoint.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great game. Different ways to play, a wonderful way to pass the time. My granddaughter plays it too, helping with eye hand coordination I think. Really a good game.
0060763280|3.0|I like the basics of this book. It is helpful and the messages are solid. There is. A great takeaway in reprogramming one's blueprint...<br /><br />I hate that he pitches his expensive seminars every few pages......after awhile the entire book just seemed like a desperate infomercial for his other products. Gives the impression that he is now a millionaire because he preys upon the downtrodden and desperate. It is definitely implied that the only way to really learn the method is to take the seminars.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Really good simple and easy read but a charming story with a bit of pain and heartache. Makes you look at your own life and be prepared to fight for the underdog. Did make me realize that all that bull poopoo my old granny said about growing up in Ireland made me realize why she left.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Some may pick this up and experience a fictional story about Zombies. I read a deeply emotional and moving commentary about society, bureaucracy, consequences, and the human will to survive. Most importantly, nearly every page was painted with the very real emotions of people facing trauma. While purely fictional, most everything written has at some point been said and felt by someone at some point in history facing hardship and the horrors the world can deliver to our doorstep without any warning. Even being fiction, there's more truth about individuals, groups of humans, governments, and how we collectively and singularly deal with the unfathomable than many factual books I've read. Moving, haunting, and an indelible look at humanity.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This has to be Outlet 7's best app yet! The notifications are simple and not annoying, there aren't many ads for slot games (why do people make those?!) And the app pic is soo adorable! I have to admit they did a great job. Best game ever! Hope everybody liked this! GET THE APP!
B000FBJAOG|3.0|My annotations and clarifications, plus amendments to this book would be a book unto itself. I had hoped for more of the in depth human perspective and societal commentary the first was bursting with, but alas it looks like a sellout work to further line a pocket. It's not that _some_ of what's in here isn't helpful, it's just hollow. And in some places, misinforming. My constructive criticism is based on my experience and training from being a former certified firearm instructor teaching concealed carry classes. Our method of teaching was very different than most programs, as we focused on situational awareness, survival and consequences. So it was much more than a class in basic civil law and gun safety. What we taught were lessons and knowledge all humans should be taught for dealing with a potentially life threatening situation, regardless if armed or not. Using my accumulated training and experiences led me often to shake my head in wonder, or at least question the value of this purely fictional read. But if you're a big fan, be sure to get a copy for yourself.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Very moving and thrilling read.  Sad ending, I wish our nation characters could have had their happy ending. However there is a lot to be learned about life love and forgiveness from this series characters.
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|Kids love the game and love lego, so great combination for them.  Kept them going on and off for a few days.  Smaller pieces than normal lego but no issues putting together.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Wow, I really wanted to see this in the theaters but did not get the chance to. I was SO glad I gave up on Netflix and stuck with my Amazon Prime! The day I saw this movie was available I watched it and wow, completely blown away does not even scratch the surface of my reaction to this film. I've seen several amazing Denzel movies and for me, this is the finest performance he has ever put forth. While his character carries an air of confidence (and to a certain degree can even come off as cockiness) he is an incredibly vulnerable man who is extremely flawed and quite broken. His portrayal of this broken man was both heart wrenching and gorgeous to watch. Any decent actor can play a drunk and make it convincing but Denzel's performance, he takes us inside of his tortured and troubled soul and really lets you look into the darkest all places.
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|Let me start by saying I always respected Satriani's talent and place among the great guitarists of our generation. However, over the years I would like one or two songs per CD and he would lose me on his 'airy' songs. This CD caught my attention in a way that resembled The Extremist years. IMO, the melodies have intent and songs are not just a venue to shred. Songs are memorable, even if one reminds me of the theme song for the Transformers :) Based on this I looked fwd to Unstoppable Momentum. This CD made me a Satriani fan, now I get what his music is about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game ever if u like being addicted to games this . Is . The . Game for u
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|All songs are crafted masterfully. Lead work is much better than Murder by Pride or Reborn. However, their best lead work is still that of Against the Law but this is a better record than that. It is like this, IMO if you could only buy 4 stryper records this would be #1, THWTD #2, SUC #3 and ATL #4. All the others are nice but a step below those 4 in that order .<br /><br />For the first time, there are no fillers- all songs are excellent.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I got  on Friday and bored of it now<br />Get the talking Tom app that lets you take care of it from when  it's a baby to adult<br /><br />Plus its free
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Tone, purposeful melodies and excellent musicianship make this album a must have. This is coming from someone who jumped off the Satch bandwagon after The Extremist and just jumped back in on Wormholes and Wizards. What Joe has been doing lately is great, memorable songs and what feels as a higher maturity level as a musician is the only way I can explain it. I mean that as a compliment, he was always a great musician but now, as a listener I feel like he lets the song itself come out vs. putting his chops in- that is what I mean by that.<br />As a side note, having Vinnie C. play the drums was the best decision since many times Joe's songs lend itself for some boring drumming. It takes a master drummer to breathe life to such passages and Vinnie is such a drummer for sure.<br /><br />Anyway, this one is a 5 star effort in my book.<br /><br />Cheers!
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this book a few times over! Can not and will not stop reading over and over again!

B008JFUPFI|4.0|Man of Steel review<br /><br />Loved everything but was overwhelmed by the final fight scene. Really loved Clark/Papa Kent relationship and I’ll always love Diane Lane until the day I die.<br /><br />Young Clark may have offered a ‘it gets better’ moment to all those youngsters in the viewing audience who are being bullied. Although Jonathan and Martha try to keep Clark under wraps, his powers are the worst kept secret in town. I like that. Even his young tormentors become allies as adults. I read about Paul McCartney-once a Beatle- who moved into a small English country town. His children went to school there and he contributed heavily to the town. The residents would shoo fans away. He was a neighbor, you see, and deserved his privacy. In Smallville, Clark’s supporters where quiet but solid folk. It’s his own business. And I personally love that he sought advice at church-advice that he acted on.<br /><br />And I like this Super Clark. Henry Cavill isn’t a pretty-boy in a blue suit. There is some meat and potatoes there and his internal conflicts show in his face and body. Loved Christopher Reeve’s version for that age. However the Man of Steel is battling terrorists; serious work there. All in all the movie was a joy.
006202406X|1.0|*spoilers*If I could give this book zero stars I would! I loved the first two books and this one started out strong. However my first problem starts about mid way in when \\"four\\" just basically says f* it I will trust a stranger and follow there lead because I'm a follower, not! This book had great potential that was lost when the main character was killed off. The out comes are endless and you choose that really! I thought mocking jay was terrible and depressing this book far surpasses that ending in a bad way. I agree that authors try and stay clear of predictability but again really you are going to kill off the main character. I'm full of disappointment I would not recommend this series now and I had originally thought it to be my favorite. This book proves people don't really evolve, they constantly make the same mistakes. A true surprise would have been Caleb finally being selfless but nope we don't evolve. Or even like other have mentioned have tris loose her memory and maybe even having four chose to loose his too and two years later showing how they found their way back...happy ending are made for a reason to make the reader happy...this reader is not happy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love I  when you play it enough you get addicted but it's an awesome game I love the minions adorable (;
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|This game is extremely fun however it is extremely irritating that there is no option to opt out of the tutorial. I haven done it like 10 freaking times now and the fact that I have to go through it 9 out of 10 times I play it makes me not want to play. There should be an option to sign in first and then ask if tutorial wanted. It is a huge point of contention in giving this game 5 stars. otherwise I would highly recommend.
140006922X|2.0|In spite of the author's own statements about his fine scholarship, there are several easy-to-see errors in his statements about scripture and its origin, and his understanding of Christianity is narrow and immature.  The bulk of his arguments against modern Christian understanding are old, narrow, and overused as opposed to the original ones i expect from a scholar.  Sorry, but this book reads like one written solely for the purpose of big sales of a semi-sensational subject, and in that it succeeded.<br />I felt it was a waste of my time to read it and my money to buy it.
B00B52F278|5.0|A 100 starts rate needs to be created only for Spartacus. I can't describe All I need to describe because I can't fined the words. What an actors! The production, director, make up, etc'etc, etc but the most important what a great message  Simply Perfect!! We should only allow this kind of programs in our planet. The ones with real meaning like this one!!! I fell totally in love w/ Spartacus.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love this game!!!! It is fun and makes me laugh. Play it and you'll see what I mean.
B009P25TQE|5.0|He is so great! So romantic. Amazing songs and voice. I can listen to his music for days non stop.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The novel is not the usual Grisham thriller.  It was pretty dull and included too many characters.  I did like the manner in which he tied the historical occurrences with the present day.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is excellent. I am really enjoying it, with no glitches that I have discovered. I really recommend it for anyone looking to kill some time with another addictive game!
B008JFUPK8|1.0|There are various ways in which to expect Superman to be, based on comics, personal opinion and taste. I will not consider theese in the review, since individual taste can't be judged.    I WILL however speak my opinion about a - if not the - SUPER-hero-MOVIE. It is supposed to be a lot of fun, action, good script and most important of all - inventive. It should show us our beloved Superheros in ways we've never seen them before.    This is ultimately not the case with this movie !!! It ripps of approximately 30 maior movies without the slightest bit of shame. to give you some examples: The ships attacking the cities (looking like the STAR TREK vessel nero uses) release an energy beam to destroy bulidings (INDEPENDENCE DAY). The Robot chick (TRON look) jumps (UNDERWOLRD MOVE, even with the bent knee). There is a lot more of this, but to complete the list, I would have to watch the movie again, and I certainly won't do that!!!    The girl-friend of the hero volunteers absolutely unneccessariely to go to the alien ship where she needs the computerized father of the hero (again, rip off TRON) to do nothing else than - escape! This escape fails so that the hero has - another - reason to save his - useless - damsel in distress. I'm not a feminist, but this portrait of a woman is shamefull! Useless decoration! Whoever wrote this should be visited by \\"the black widow\\" if you get my meaning!    The movie rips off shamelessly a lot of movies, but that's not the only bad part: the flashbacks happen now and then, suddenly and lame, don't help to build the already set super-heros character and even lack the right ammount of pathos, gravity and heroism.    This is the worst movie I've seen this decade - and I've seen Super-Shark and Sharknado!    Don't support the \\"copy-paste\\"-Strategy with unimaginative (or unwilling to take risks) Hollywood and DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!    If you want good popcorn-Super-heros: Go Avengers: Far from perfect, but an eternety better than this S***
0375869026|5.0|Excellent book.. on time.. as expected....<br />great read for all ages!!!!!!!! You will not regret buying... great for kids and adults both.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books. Although his books can be predictable, you still always pull for the love and character to win. This one is no different.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Amazing product - I'm loving the fact that you can pick whatever color you want for the back of the Mouse to show. The weight changing feature is pretty cool too. So glad I purchased this one over higher priced models. WIll definitely buy Anker in the future!
0307730697|5.0|It is an amazing book, that tells the story of a brave man; a man, that was able to overcome an addiction, to a specific substance that  never truly relinquishes it's grip. It is a story, that I would recommend anyone reading. It is a testament of how one can hit rock bottom, and rebound to the Himalayas. Adam Brown shows, anything is possible, you just have to want it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it, but it needs an update with more levels like my phone and pc have. I have beaten all these levels already. Please update
B00D9RQO56|5.0|Video and audio quality are simply amazing. This is a great upgrade from the dvd release and is a worthy addition to anyones bluray collection.<br /><br />This release is truly a masterpiece.
0316322407|5.0|My 11 year old son is reading this and he loves it, he says it will make you cry and it's a tough read at times, but it's really helping him understand how important access to education is.  Malala is his new hero.
B005CWRB44|5.0|Just Groovy. Bought one, had it for a while and then bought four more to give to my family members. Small enough to keep with your keys and powerful as a motherflower, it packs a strong beam. Three settings (low, medium, high). Battery goes for ever.
1451666179|5.0|Seriously, unless you are dead inside, you will find much enjoyment in this book.<br />It's funny and silly, but also deeply insightful and honest, which really makes for the best writing.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|In this album, Paul seems to be taking a look at himself, his feelings about life, and the world around him. This album has a number of excellent songs arranged in a variety of styles (rock, bluesy, ballads, etc.). McCartney took the time to collaborate with a few producers in order to help bring a fresh arrangement to the many diverse songs and also give the album a different kind of &#34;edge&#34; . The diversity of the arrangements help to keep the listener engaged.<br /><br />I liked this album right from the start, but I found the more I listened to it, the more I liked it- even better than before. Some of my favorite songs include &#34;Queenie Eye&#34; (which reminds me of &#34;I Am the Walrus&#34;), &#34;Alligator&#34; (Love the line where Paul says; &#34;I need a sweet communicator I can give my alligator to!&#34;), &#34;Everybody Out There&#34; (where Paul says &#34;We are the brightest stars in the sky&#34;, and &#34;It's time to do some good before we say goodbye&#34;.) Another interesting song is &#34;Appreciate&#34; ( which seems to sample the main guitar motive from Boney M's &#34;He Was a Steppenwolf&#34;). &#34;Scared&#34; (the hidden track on the album) is (in my opinion) the best song with it's beautiful haunting melody. &#34;Hosanna&#34; is my least favorite song, but it is growing on me each time I listen to it.<br /><br />There are a number of different editions available if you purchase this album. There is the regular edition (with it's red cover) containing 12 tracks (and the hidden track &#34;Scared). There is the Deluxe version which adds 2 more tracks to the line up (along with the hidden track). There is the &#34;Best Buy&#34; version that comes with collector cards. Then there is the &#34;Target&#34; version that comes with an extra DVD. If you want 15 tracks (plus the hidden track),  buy the Japanese version which includes the extra track (&#34;Struggle&#34;). The rarest version of the album that I'm aware of is the F.Y.E. version whichcomes with the battery powered cube that glows in different colors. I had a hard time tracking this one down.It's almost impossible to find now. (I have the F.Y.E. version, the Target version, and the Japanese version in my collection.)<br /><br />Yes! Buy the album. Which ever version you purchase, you will enjoy it. The songs are in a variety of styles, the arrangements are excellent, and the lyrics will give you insight about McCartney, his feelings about his life and the world around us.
B009FZFONO|3.0|This is the one season that they could have done without.  Too much prison time and Woodberry time.  Not a good mix.  But you have to watch to keep up with the story.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very well made. Entertainment for hours on hand. Perfect for spare time. Down side is only being able to use when Wifi is present.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|This movie was pretty good.  You have like this guy's style.  It is a great story about a dead dog come back to life.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Simply one of the best series every made for television!  John Ham and John Slattery are tremendous, so is the rest of the cast.  Deals with social issues of the time, extremely well. Can't say enough about the series.  No BS here, makes things and issues, how they really were.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I like playing this game. It remin ds<br /><br />me of my childhood and playing with my kids...everyone should play this game.it's fun....
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Bought two of these for my son (Army) and son in law (Navy).  Good quality product. They really liked it.
0823015017|5.0|An inspirational volume, filled with gorgeous illustrations, and clear, simple to understand instructions. A great beginning for the amateur, and good for the more advance clay artist as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the one touch feature and after playing for a while the ads go away. Best free solitaire I've played.
0823013626|5.0|Donna Kato has given us yet another excellent teaching book, ranging from simple to advanced techniques that anyone can easily follow. My wife says that it has made a valuable addition to her instructional volumes, and that the quality of her projects has improved noticeably since acquiring it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My kids and I play together. They love seeing all the different kinds of fish and things you grow. It's just a fun app!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Great gift for my Grandson that I am surprised he hasn't wore it out.  He can tell you every toy character and has collected most of them
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game.... its addictive and fun!!! take caution u might fall in love! its challenging and so much more! recommended for all ages!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This &#34;horror&#34; TV series requires above average suspension of disbelief.  Nonetheless it is great fun to watch.  Gun & Ammo magazine even did a piece on the weapons of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;.  The homemade silencers require an exceptionally open mind, as does the world class marksmanship these people show at some times and exceptionally poor shooting at others.<br /><br />It's still fun, but not for kids!
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Well, it's Sigma. Of course it's good.<br /><br />Rollins didn't kill the new guy this time. Maybe he'll be back. Can't say I want magnets in my fingertips. With all the electricity in the world, I think it would drive me nuts. But they came in handy for this story.<br /><br />Rollins did, however, kill one of my favorite characters. I cried.<br /><br />Unrequited love appears to be requited. Now what?<br /><br />And the ending? It's definitely got me thinking.<br /><br />If you haven't read a Sigma Force novel, I strongly suggest you start at the beginning and work your way forward. You have a lot of good reading ahead of you. If you've been reading the series, here's another good one.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is fantastic the only problem is it needs UPDATES biscuit to be on because the first to comment by a coin is no r a coin is healed and terrible things that are practically all Pokemon
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love the direction this books takes. Intertwining lives, decisions and fate. Love is tested. Secrets revealed, in such a way that you can not stop reading. Great read!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Well-written, fresh and filled with intelligence, &#34;World War Z&#34; is both attention grabbing and entertaining.<br /><br />A must read for anyone with a mind for logistics and strategy. A must read for anyone with a taste for adventure.
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|Yay
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app is very informative and works well on my Kindle Fire..  I would recommend it to a friend.  Yah !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  The graphics are great, it never freezes up like some games do and if you're competitive, you can tell your friends when you've passed them!
B00E9A656K|5.0|I think you should play this awsome car racing game if your a real car racer.Even if you not a car racer you cold still play.If you play you will get amazed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love it.....can't stop playing! I could play in my sleep if it were humanly possible! I wish it was!
B00428CPUY|2.0|i got this for my dad who now is not apart of my family anymore.  so when i see this it makes me disappointed again. ha.  i never watched this.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham invites the reader to wrestle with the complexity of issues they haven't even taken time to wonder about.
B005LAIGLO|4.0|it is a good movie but not stellar.  Im a big Marky Mark fan and it keeps me entertained.  get it
B0095H4FAA|1.0|Here I find myself going against the grain (which I'm certain will happen more and more as I post reviews). I can't rant and rave and tell you how super this book was. Why? Well, because....to me it wasn't. I guess I just missed something. Or perhaps it's the \\"popularity\\" of \\"If it's made into a movie it has to be great.\\"<br /><br />I never was able to fall in love (or hate) with any of the characters. They all seemed to fall flat (and we know-I love vivid, crawl out of the book characters). They were dry. They told of feeling, happening -- rather than showing it. I want to feel like I'm in the middle of something. I want to immerse into being one of the characters (or at least, wishing I could be one of them). Or, at the very least, relating to whatever it is the author has them going through.<br /><br />[...]
B004EPYZV2|3.0|mission impossible is just not as good as the first one or the second one.  i think i fell asleep to this movie honestly.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|A terrific view of the inner workings  of last decade's A's. I liked the book even better than the movie!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Miyazaki won an Oscar for this and it was well deserved.  Tight story, gorgeous animation, and fabulous soundtrack (thanks to Joe Hisaishi).  Watch it!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|These are quality DVDs and what's not to like about the Castle series.  Crystal clear picture and very good sound.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|Hiromi shows off her brilliance and her sincere music loving spirit shines through as always. I'm always amazed at how her face shows how much she loves to play and she is surely one of the best. I saw her in an NHK documentary with Yano Akiko (there's also available in Japan a CD/DVD that they did together) and I was surprised that she looks so different to me when she's just standing around talking and not playing, the keyboard just sets her on fire. Anthony and Simon are tight and their playing makes this session hit. Simon plays with the power of rock, but the fluidity of jazz and Anthony walks all over the bass. Video quality is good, sound is also good with Dolby 5.1 and stereo PCM. It would have been great if a producer would ever use the multi-angle feature of DVDs to show each player and their hands and let the viewer switch, but I haven't found one yet.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Typical Moore flamboyance. For those who believe in universal health care rights, a must. For those who still think that our healthcare is the best, a myth buster. Some will get upset, but hopefully it will prompt people to do some research of their own.
B0024FAG1W|4.0|This is an entertaining action film.  Roy Scheider does his usual good job as the lead, Warren Oates as his police captain has some great lines, and the helicopter chase scenes are real time, not CGI (except maybe for the loop).
B005CKPQNE|5.0|first rate, soprano-esque for quality screenplay.  breakout roles for many new players plus a small cadre of established superstars.  what a man won't do to provide!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Miyazaki is a genius and this is another example of why.  Tight story, gorgeous animation, and fabulous soundtrack (thanks to Joe Hisaishi).  Good stuff.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I just purchased the book, mainly for two reasons.  Most 5 star reviews say that Dr. Scarpetta is back in good form.  I have missed her from the early years and wondered why she got so off track with werewolves, etc.  It got to the point that I didn't even like the characters anymore and they all depressed me.<br />Secondly, because so many people are violently outraged that the author used the Newtown tragedy as a backdrop.  At this point, having not read the book I see no reason why she shouldn't and would be interested from a Medical Examiners perspective what awful things must must have happened that day  with first responders.<br />After I read the book, I will return and adjust my review if I feel a need to.  This five start in the mean time is given only to offset the one stars given only because of the Newtown backdrop.
0767919408|5.0|Enjoyable! Not only does he tell of the events, but he gives interesting tidbits connected to the event. For example, one event is Lindberg's solo flight to Paris. You learn of the other pilots who tried, why everyone tried to do it, and their outcome. You learn who was in office and the time and why that was interesting to know. You learn about the condition of economy and the land. And, you learn it in an easy to read and understand format. It is definitely a story and not just a history lesson.
0316019984|4.0|our favourite childhood super heroes are larger than life as they spring out of the book. simply love turning the papers.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|This is the best Christmas Album ever.  The boys' voices are just superb. The variety in arrangements of the songs makes this Christmas album very classy.
0385350864|5.0|I know some of the negativity of past fans to this book is that (spoiler) ......Marc Darcy has died. But to judge a book so harshly just because a favorite character is gone isn't really fair to the writing. Yes, it's terribly sad, but in a way it makes the book somewhat more realistic alongside the usual Bridget based silliness. Just like in the first books when you could feel Bridget's frustration with the men she met and her fear of winding up alone, in this book it is Mark's death that serves the same purpose. Once past that the book is extremely funny. Bridget's frustration with technology, her children's activities and sometimes bad behavior, fellow private school parents, aging, and of course dating, all make for a very entertaining read. There is some sadness and a previously un-Bridget like sense of responsibility that underlies it all, but without that it would seem like Bridget hadn't matured in the last 15 years, so I am glad that was there. Read it without holding a grudge against Fielding for killing off Mark Darcy and you will like it. And if it makes anyone feel better (more spoilers), Fielding does give Bridget a worthwhile companion that I think even Mark would approve of.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|So bad I regretted having read the frst two books.  Mommy AND daddy issues?  That's what this comes down to?  Ugh
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Played on facebook. And now to play on my kindle is awesome. Different from original but in a very good way. Im not sure i will be able to put it down.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Great for your kids! I played for 2hours. Like the graphics too. cool games that they put out too. For fun for hours and hours of play.
B0067EKY9K|5.0|The overall transfer to Blu-Ray was done very well.  My wife and I saw this movie in the theater and loved the story.  This is one of those movies to watch again and again without getting bored.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|it's depeche mode, what more do you want me to say, ok, fine i'll say more, martin gore is a brilliant songwriter, underappreciated, and never lets me down, except when it's appropriate because life is a balance i'm still trying to get right, anyways i've gone on long enough, have some cake
1603429999|5.0|Fantastic book - a must have for beginning to advanced. A real classic - up there with my Barbara Walker books. You won't regret the purchase. Everything you need to know about how to make beautifully executed and finished circular items, with a variety of techniques, beautifully laid-out book, good photos, useful projects. Decent index.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The author does a good job using many illustrations to show that the things which have become our default behavior can be changed once we recognize our natural actions are as much a matter of conditioning than they are of conscious choice.
0307719219|5.0|Acemoglu reveals the structural and dynamic realities of national growth. He shows the importance of rule of law in allowing people to thrive, create, and invest.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This, along with King's recent novel about time travel, gives me hope that the master is back among us.  I quit reading him after the regrettable &#34;Tommyknockers&#34;, but have enjoyed these two books.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|My favorite Pixar characters are back and better than ever. Monsters INC is a classic film. I think everyone can agree with that. So I was nervous while watching Monsters U but it did not disappoint at all. Such a pleasure to watch. It's basically an animated, family friendly, remake of Revenge of the Nerds, and as a child of the 80s that was really fun to see.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was great! It was a lot of fun and a couple of rooms were challenging. fun fun fun fun
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This has been one of the most compellingly books I have ever read. It ha  opened my eyes to the struggles of the Afghan refugees.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Bizzarre Frankenstein of a movie. For most of its running time, it appears to be some sort of Dwayne Johnson throwaway intercut with an unfinished asian martial arts film. Only towards the end to the two plots kind of come together, with a climax set at Fort Sumter. Fort Sumter?! Yes, Fort Sumpter. This sequel makes GI Joe look like Paths of Glory. Oh, and England is completely destroyed, but we save France. Really, we save France at the expense of England? And how did Jonathan Pryce, a respected actor, get involved in this sort of thing? Not that I mind, he is the best thing about the movie, and given the best lines. And why not? He delivers them with gusto and class. The same goes for Walter Goggins (Justified), whose turn as the warden of a super prison is the second best thing about the film.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|There are many episodes in this season that are so entertaining, fascinating, and well written. The episode &#34;A Matter of Time&#34; is very captivating and just shows the creativity of the series.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very enjoyable, easy reading. Read it with my children out loud. We also read several chapters then discussed them. It showed that children do have worth.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Finally a superman movie  where Superman actually kicks some butt. This film does for superman what Batman Begins did for Batman. It reinvents the hero for the 21st century. The movie is a classic in my opinion. I just finished watching the blu ray and it is great! The picture is absolutely gorgeous in 1080p. The special features are cool as well. Some really entertaining making of's, which are my favorite special features on Blu Rays. Overall I highly recommend this movie for Superman fans as well as people who maybe haven't really been into the Superman character.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|My game has reset somehow and has me starting over! I was level 50 something and have spent real money. I love this game and refuse to start over can this issue be fixed?
B0089LOG02|4.0|200,,000 children were removed from the New York street, put on a train though  various country America and people picked out who they wanted to take home. Very  little protection for the children and certainly di not have a lot of say in their lived.
B0010T3UUC|2.0|Sent these back as they weren't like my first pair that fit perfectly.  The instep was too tight for me.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|After extensive research, I chose this model over all others.<br />It works well with my iPhone, but my wife's Samsung Galaxy Stellar would not<br />pair with it.<br />So, it defeats the idea of using this unit with 2 phones when we are both in the same car.<br /><br />I went to a local Verizon Wireless store, and they could not pair Samsung Galsxy Stellar<br />with this Supertooth. They said that some Androids have trouble with some blue tooth devices. So, be aware!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addictive. I cant stop playing this game. I play on the kindle and the blackberry and the action is great on both.
B008JFUS28|5.0|Excellent sequel. One of the problems I had with the first Thor was it spent so much time on Earth. This one really shows Asgard and it's great to see as a long time comic fan. Also the battle scenes during one part, won't go into detail because of spoilers but WOW. This guy who directed this movie also directed several episodes of Game of Thrones and it shows. He was a great choice and I would love to see him get a shot at directing one of the Star Wars movies that are coming out in the future. Overall a really fun experience and I can't wait to see Captain America and Guardians of the Galaxy next year!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I gladly gave this book 5 stars because it was very clever and I<br />love fantasy books. You should try it if you like fantasy
B001E45XT4|2.0|I use this headphone for playing starcraft with my friends online.  The sound isn't amazing.  The comfort isn't amazing.  But it works well enough and reliably and it was cheap.  I wouldn't use it for listening to music...I have better headphones for that.<br /><br />The only annoyance is that the volume control on the cable gets turned very easily (by my 2-year old).  Also the mute button on the cable gets engaged really easily, which means I often find myself trying to figure out why people aren't hearing me and having to dive for the volume.  Maybe if the volume control was closer up on the cable or something it would be better.<br /><br />======= Edit some time later ===========<br /><br />I only used this periodically but it actually broke in a non-repairable way after a smallish number of uses.  The volume control and mute are in a little plastic box in line with the cord.  Well, the cord isn't very securely attached to that box, so if the cord gets yanked, it pulls directly on the internal soldering.  With a pretty moderate yank (I think I tripped over it while it was plugged into my computer) one of the solders detached.  I tried bypassing or fixing it but it's not easily repaired even if you have a moderate amount of skill repairing this kind of thing.<br /><br />Taking off two stars from the original 4 star review because it's not very durable.  These headphones work ok but be sure not to let the cord get pulled.
8186336141|5.0|great descriptions and illistrations of poses, and full of beautiful ideas from the Bihar style of yoga. worth sharing with your friends who love yoga and want to learn it from another deep perspective.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This is a really great film. this is the superman i have been waiting to see since i was a child. so what if its a little darker than previous installments. get with the times people. everything cant be sunshine and rainbows. the effects are extremely well done. highly recommend
B005C6HGSG|4.0|If you are a fan of Supernatural you will enjoy this book.  There is the main story of Bobby losing his memory and writing down all he knows about things that go bump in the night.  Within that are short stories of Bobby's past adventures that made him who he is (his origin).  Dean pops in near the end to conclude the story.  The book stays true to the series due to author, David Reed, who was also a script coordinator on the TV show Supernatural.<br /><br />The only hole I can find in the book is when Bobby is talking about Werewolves.  See if you can find the flaw that conflict with the series.
B004Q3RKH8|5.0|One of the greatest rock records of all time gets even better! I missed out on getting this on vinyl when it originally came out so I was happy to finally be able to add this to my record collection.  Also love how Amazon gives you a free MP3 version to listen to on my smart phone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very entertaining nice app I'm living it recommended to all who like challenges with a lol bit of fun aid it
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Pretty good movie.  For most of the movie it's just fun but then the end is really fun.  My wife liked it more than I did but we were both happy to add it to the collection.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Good family movie! As a fan of the old Japanese scifi movies (Godzilla, etc.) this was a fun movie to watch.
B00C2C637I|2.0|It was ok but I could not completely grasp the wording maybe because it is kinda old. I will most likely finish it at another time maybe read it again.
006202406X|4.0|Allegiant in regards to its predecessors was definitely a slower read, but the plot still kept me interested and thirsting to get to the end. I have read online many reviews from people who were disappointed by the ending and feel like there was no hope left. However, I still felt that hope in the character of Tobias who continued to be strong and prosper. I enjoyed the book because I thought it was well written and I think the author made a great decision in the way she ended it. It was truly the only realistic ending to the story.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|A really fun sequel that reminds me of how much I liked the original. Hard core comic book fans will probably be mad but I've never been a huge Iron man comics fan so the big reveal in the movie didn't bother me at all. Also this is probably the closest we will get to a &#34;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&#34; sequel.  Just a fun movie overall and Marvel made an inspiring choice with the director.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|BLAZING FAST, everything i need to play games on my computer. Set up is instant with my motherboard MSI B-75. Playing Skyrim and WoW at amazing FPS with the Radeon 7770hd &#60;--out of date but i'm still pushing 180fps on wow and over 100 on Skyrim.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|My wife has been using this processor in her computer for some time and it has been a great performer..very reliable.  I know the fourth generation is out now, but this one is still a good performer.  There hasn't been all that much innovation.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Storyline great, hard to put down; very good psychopath story.  I found the book hard to put down.  The ending was disappointing, a let down, which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Certain characters came so close to figuring out Amy, but they all of a sudden just gave up, after everything she had done.  The author is obviously writing sequels to this one, but not interested.  The next one will involve a baby; I don't think I can stomach what Amy might do to a child.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Being able to wirelessly stream content controlled via laptop, cell phone, or tablet for only $35 is incredible. You can get one for each the TVs in your house. You can put a TV almost anywhere, such as your kitchen, and cast content to it without having a TV connection. Note to readers, there is a way to cast your entire desktop from the Chrome browser running on your PC. Once you've installed the Google Cast extension into your chrome browser, you'll have the cast icon in the upper right. When you click on this, there is a little &#34;down arrow&#34; and if you click on that you can select to cast your entire desk top. I find this very useful for casting pictures viewed on my laptop. By the way, I recommend the FastStone picture viewer for Windows which can be downloaded for free via CNET downloads. If you like it you can make a donation if you want.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|very clever the way the plague/virus spreads throughout the world and there's a need to visit several countries in an attempt to find a cure
B00E00P5JC|5.0|Such a fun family movie! I saw this in the theater and it was one of the best film experiences I had this past summer. This film was really overlooked by the general public because it came out after Despicable Me 2 and Monsters University, two sequels to two massively popular films. Dreamworks really dropped the ball on the release date. It should have came out later in the year and I think the box office return would have been much higher.  Hopefully this film will find its place on Blu Ray and DVD, much like the under appreciated Dreamworks film Rise of the Guardians that came out last Christmas.
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|Great book. It explains the story a lot better than movie. Could not put it down. Already downloading the next
B004EPYZUS|4.0|This is a fine movie.  I'm glad they didn't drop the ball with this like they did with the second one.  The first was so great.  Second one was just awful.  I like this better than the third one, so I'd say it was the second best in the series.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This is such a great game I let my kids play it and my husband likes to play it too!
B00499NHLC|5.0|The stars are unique, crazy, fast paced, and sometimes laugh out loud funny. It is the best modern rendition of Sherlock that I have seen. Watson has a slightly different approach toward Sherlock in the story line which makes It a very enjoyable and interesting series that I will continue to view.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|This was a good book but I hated the ending. I didn't want her to die! She was my favorite character and her death wasn't even dramatic! ;(
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Sometimes Stephen King drags a story to long but I love the climax story of the book. I love have he ties the characters together<br />actually had me go back to reread parts of the The Shining. I was a little disappointed with Rose. She should have been more<br />powerful, since she was the leader.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I have absolutely adored Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle since I was a child, so reading the book that inspired the beloved movie was delightful to no end. Even better? The book was just as enjoyable as the movie.<br /><br />What I liked in the book that wasn't in the movie was how Sophie's perspective is shown in a much clearer and interesting light. Sophie's knack for adapting to her new physical form is amusing, and a few more characters appear. It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I'm pretty sure Howl didn't have an apprentice and there was no Miss Angorian either. (If I'm wrong, please correct me. ;)<br /><br />The magic involved is also just so... Magical. That's really the only way to describe it. The wizardry invented isn't fake and cliche, and what it reminded me of most was Harry Potter. It's the kind of writing that makes me wish I lived in their world so I can walk around in seven-league boots and whatnot.<br /><br />If you loved Studio Ghibli's production of Howl's Moving Castle, you will be captivated by this book. I think of it as almost containing all the good parts of the movie, except with more detail and complexity. Reading this was a very pleasant stroll down memory lane for me, and it will be for you too. ;)
B00464AVXW|5.0|As much as I make purchases from Amazon, I should have written at least one review by now. But this movie was such a thriller that I felt obligated to say at least a few words about it and this will be my first, but brief, review. Without spoiling anything, the movie in general had me on the edge of my seat. The ending, on the other hand, had me staring at the tv with my jaw on the floor. Enough said. Great movie, solid plot, great character development. Seven has earned 5 stars from me- and typically I'm pretty picky when it comes to movies.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|It was hat to understand in the first few pages. Once they moved to the island it made much more sense.
B004VQFQ2Q|4.0|Was hesitant to move on after Mob Rules but I'm glad I did. Quality Work and heck Bill Ward is back on it so why not give it a listen! Gillan did a great job on vocals. The live recordings sound fantastic on this Deluxe Edition.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|One of my favorite Authors , has capacity to take the reader through his bizarre, genius mind through story telling. I love how Gaiman  incorporates an &#34;enigma within an enigma&#34;, with the mundane. Please leave your rules of reality the door, before turning the first page.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Yep, I know. Many of these songs have appeared on other compilations. On the other hand, as of 2012, this does a nice job of presenting major songs over the past five decades. Are all songs I'd like to hear on this CD? No.  Some early songs are not here. But it's not easy to include songs from 50 years on even 3 CDs.<br /><br />One of the things that I like is the inclusion of more recent songs--&#34;She Was Hot&#34;; &#34;Harlem Shuffle&#34;; &#34;Love Is Strong&#34;; &#34;Under Cover of the Night&#34; and so on. Would I have liked to see more recent cuts? Sure. But this CD does a nice job of giving us a sense of the body of work.<br /><br />We see some of the earliest songs--&#34;Come On,&#34; Buddy Holly's &#34;Not Fade Away,&#34; &#34;The Last Time&#34;. . . . Then, we experience some of the classics--&#34;Satisfaction,&#34; &#34;Get Off of My Cloud,&#34; &#34;Under My Thumb&#34;. . . . Then, the wow era--&#34;Jumping Jack Flash, &#34; Street Fighting Man,&#34; &#34;Sympathy for the Devil,&#34; &#34;Street Fighting Man,&#34; &#34;Brown Sugar,&#34; and so on (II do wish that &#34;Midnight Rambler&#34; was included--a classic!).<br /><br />Then, some key songs from the wonderful &#34;Exile on Main Street.&#34; After that? Cool songs from later albums. The number of terrific songs per album/CD decreased (with some fine albums yet to come)--but there were still fine tunes created later by the band.<br /><br />If you want a sense of the Stones' oeuvre over five decades, this does a nice job.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is one of Disney's best offerings ever. The animation, the story, the writing, the music.  Each of these is flawless.  People like to talk about Disney's renaissance period (beauty and the beast, etc.) but I think this one is actually better than their hand-animated movies.  For me it's more enjoyable.  I always recommend it to people who (for whatever reason) haven't already seen it.  To miss this movie would be quite a shame.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Good game I am also playing another dragon game which to be fair you are able to complete quests quicker than this one's
B000067FP7|3.0|One of my favorite all-time films (especially around Christmas) so I'd never say anything negative about the movie itself, BUT I bought this edition because the case claims to include a \\"behind-the-scenes documentary.\\" I've gone through all the special features, and all the behind-the-scenes option includes is a couple pages of text. That was a big selling point for an 80s kid who grew up under Spielberg's reign. Beyond that, I am appreciative of the commentaries, and I'll never get tired of watching this movie.
0446569909|5.0|Excellent Read. You will laugh. If you are a Sabbath and/or Ozzy fan, and you are capable of reading, buy this.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I upgraded to the H4N from an H1 a few months ago, and haven't looked back since.<br /><br />The audio quality is unmatched by the rival Tascam DR-40, and the fact that the H4N comes with its own plastic case is a small touch that goes a long way in terms of practical usage/packing/transportation of the device.<br /><br />The two XLR inputs work flawlessly with my audio devices, and I've been able to utilize the very cheap (&#60; $20) Audio Technica ATR-3350 lav mics with a &#60; $10 Rode adapter to achieve astounding results at bargain-basement prices.<br /><br />The menu on the H4N is intuitive - but do give yourself a tour of the menu when you first receive the device. It gives you great flexibility over recording modes and quality, but if you jump in to use the device without checking it all out first, you may get some surprising results. In my case, phantom power was set to ON for the XLR inputs -- that Phantom Power created ear-crunching interference when using my ATR-3350 lavs + Rode XLR Adapters. But once I took a trip through the menu and turned off phantom power, set record settings to 4 track with the onboard mics on 2 and the XLR inputs on the other 2, and record quality to the highest setting, I've achieved better audio quality than I imagined possible at this price point.<br /><br />If you're recording serious audio on ultra-low budgets, go straight for the H4N. I wish I had skipped the H1 and just spent a bit more for the H4N to begin with -- there is also a standard 1/4 input, as on the H1, but the onboard mics, recording quality, and options on the H4N so vastly exceed those of the H1 should go straight here and, like me, never look back.

B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Be prepared for a wild ride if you venture into the realm of music hosted by Lady Gaga and her new album ARTPOP.  The album itself is a diverse mix of songs that keeps the journey fresh.  Although not perfect, it’s still a good modern pop musical adventure.<br /><br />This compilation houses various standout tracks.  Aura’s pounding beat and blend of foreign music with futuristic sounds starts the album like a roaring engine with Lady Gaga inviting us to witness the determination hidden behind the Aura.  Do What U Want’s warm yet powerful beat and composition is very catchy and reminiscent of Lady Gaga's synth-fueled album The Fame.  The hidden gem on this album is most certainly ARTPOP.  An alluring, gentle pop track, ARTPOP is mysterious, fresh, and addicting.  It’s a new sound not just for Lady Gaga but for many unsuspecting pop spectators.  Dope is an emotionally-fueled confession of addiction between a person and the green stuff, showcasing Lady Gaga’s raw talent in front of a piano.  Applause ends the trip strong, with a clapping beat and brash synth that thunders like a room full of happy people.<br /><br />ARTPOP is a bold album, and while the risk mainly pays off for the best there are a few nuances to the experience.  The production on MANiCURE and Sexxx Dreams is subpar; Lady Gaga’s vocals, although great, overshadow the instrumentals that supplement towards delivering the songs.  The tracks Donatella and Fashion! are just downright all over the place.  It’s easy to hear the sound, but it’s hard to truly listen to the music generated in these two tracks.  Lastly, considering the album was brought forth by Lady Gaga, the majority of the tracks are themed around sex and drugs.  Although there is deeper meaning in each track, sex and drugs may be a large obstacle for listeners to get around in order to fully translate what they’re listening to.  ARTPOP embodies plenty of special qualities, but those who can’t see beyond the prevalence ofsex and drugs won’t be able to see the true vision of ARTPOP.<br /><br />Like The Fame Monster, ARTPOP takes a bunch of tracks with different sounds and throws them together to create a unique audio experience.  Lady Gaga explores and meshes various genres with different beats and synths to produce a modern pop album unlike any out there.  Although it has its flaws, ARTPOP is a cool experience that redefines pop music.  Fans of Lady Gaga will enjoy ARTPOP, and people new to her music will require a few listens (and maybe some sampling of her previous work) to adopt the correct perspective for listening to the sound spectrum that is ARTPOP.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This book is a paradigm shifter.  I have always encouraged my students and my own children to trust the practice process but now I understand exactly how it works.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I don't really care about the majority of the characters introduced in this book, preferring the original 3 books characters, so I couldn't get into it
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun and super addictive. It's like a throw back to my Tetris days, sigh....but, when I used to play Tetris there wasn't a charge, or waiting time for more lives. You lose 5 (which can happen quicker then you think) you either have to wait or pay....not necessarily a bad thing, but it'll tick you off.
0773541837|5.0|In this brilliantly written biography, the only modern one of Lord Mansfield, Poser deftly details the life and times of the most important English judge of all times.  Judge Mansfield's continuing influence on American law (he is still cited often today), is something about which all American lawyers and judges should be aware.  Yet the book is written in a readable and fluid style that also captures the complexity of the man along with his times.  I am giving this to all of my lawyer friends for Christmas!
B002C4YYEU|4.0|We went back and forth a bit before deciding whether to get this.  It was definitely an interesting and compelling movie.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.  What we haven't done is rewatch it over and over.  Maybe I should have just rented it again if necessary.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I don't know whose ideas came first, but this book - along with the Wheat Belly series - seems to answer all the useful questions about weight loss and the food connection to general health.  Unfortunately, also like Wheat Belly, Dr Perlmutter tends to wander off in rants from time; which, to me, raises some suspicions.  I'm a little frustrated at how much genuine scientific expertise it would take make a realistic evaluation of all the facts presented in this well-written book.<br /><br />I can say that the changes I've made, based on the findings in Grain Brain and Wheat Belly have resulted in remarkable improvement in all of the health indicators that I track (along with my doctor).  My internist is pleased and impressed with my progress.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|The book varies from the movie in several ways,  especially the relationship with Peetah and Katniss. The book was as entertaining as the movie and because of the differences, makes it more inviting.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|Best movie about sweetness and all the things you want your kids to emulate.  Work hard, take care of each other, don't let someone tell you that you can't do something.  And leave your reality at the door.
6305428042|5.0|This was the perfect movie to show to a group traveling by motorcoach bus to Salem, MA in October.  The fact that it was filmed in Salem and mentioned several times in our Spooktacular Tour of Salem made it even more special.  It is not an easy task to find a movie that will appeal to a group of varied ages...this movie was enjoyed by everyone.  It was fun.  Thank you.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Cute movie and and great birthday gift for my 6yo. She loved it and I know it'll be on her movie rotation!
B00CFA222M|4.0|This movie was suprrizingly good. Somehow I thought it would be sillier and less exciting than it was.  It's mostly an action movie.  My family and I liked it quite well.  We decided we would buy it if we ever found it cheap.  Then we did.  Thanks, Amazon.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a pretty good game if you want something to just pass the time. I do a lot of playing on this between classes.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie in the theater and enjoyed watching it again at home. The fight scenes are great and there's even a good plot with story arcs for most of the main characters.<br /><br />The BR transfer is very good and the behind the scenes extras are pretty interesting. I gained a lot of respect for the actors watching them filming the Jager scenes on a massive moving platform.<br /><br />Story gripe: Why don't they use their ranged weapons (guns, missiles, etc.) first before closing to boxing range rather than last?
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Amazing graphics, great storyline, great acting and the 3D is phenomenal. not as great as the cinema, but nearly on par.
1476734941|3.0|Boring read, not enough recipes for me and the subject matter is a little nuts. Was delivered on time and in good shape.
0399157573|2.0|I have read all of Ms. Cornwell's books and have progressively liked them less and less after about book 6 in the series. Books like Postmortem, The Body Farm, All That Remains, Cruel and Unusual, focused on forensic science and it's practice with Scarpetta's personal life and relationships secondary. The later books are more focused on Scarpetta's relationships with forensic science playing second, or even third fiddle.  Ms.Cornwall remains a gifted writer and continues that in this latest book but for me personally, I don't like the shift in focus: I'm really tired of the trials and tribulations of Scarpett's gay niece Lucy, and her husband Benton's mysterious disappearances and absences, and Marino's everlasting &#34;crush&#34; on her. Enough already, please return to focusing on forensics, those were the best, most interesting books. If I wanted a rather twisted, psycho, version of a Harlequin Romance, I'd buy one.
B0093H8H8I|4.0|I bought this processor to power a computer that I use for one purpose only: to run a MIDI software piano connected to my digital piano.  I need something with moderate performance and that didn't cost too much.  This little guy fit the bill perfectly.  I have had no problems with it.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Probably one of the best Batman films out including the Nolan films. And although Conroy isn't voicing the Bat, Greenwood still provides an amazing performance.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Very solid charger. I have both Apple and Android phones and iPads and this charger is FAST.  It is the only one I've used that can charge and play internet radio at the same time while driving.  All my other chargers discharge slowly while trying this.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Play all the time.....please add me.  Like being able to play anywhere I go.<br />It is a lot like castleville on Facebook.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This was actually a children's book made into a movie. It's a wonderful WWII movie, though gory in parts. 18,000 horse were left behind after WWII. Many were slaughtered because the British could not bring them back to England. In the book, the story is the view of the horse, but that could not be carried into the film. But any WWII buffs would find this movie educational.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Star Trek meets twilight.<br />I hate to be &#34;that guy&#34; that goes against a popular movie and look down his nose at it but... It is just soooo bad. A terrible bland waste of a great character Khan. Why did they get a wimpy accountant to play him? Like the other Trek movie by JJ, the story is an absurd rushed paint by the numbers movie that should appeal to all those twilight fans. The casting is great, and the acting, what little there is, is good. But the story is pure clich&eacute; and so painfully predictable, I nearly fell asleep in the theatre. With MTV fast cutting and everyone running and screaming it should has been called &#34;Star Trek Extreme to the MAX DUDE!!!&#34; And every character should have had his own tricked out skate board. I cringed throughout this embarrassing mess of a twelve year old boys take on star trek. Most of the Star Trek movies have had flaws, but the JJ brand is an insult to anyone who expected more. A sad lost opportunity.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Current trends in music are pretty good.  I'm well beyond the demographic that determines which music is in right now, but I have to say this is one of the better boy bands I have heard.  This CD has many songs that I like well and none of them are annoying or boring.  It gets listened to a lot in my house.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|Such an underrated film. I honestly don't know what people were expecting when they went to see this in the theater, but it captured the original show beautifully. Just sad not more people were able to enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Pretty cool game. Keeps me coming back and I am not easy to get hook on a game. I highly recommend it.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun and addictive. app seems to work well so far. no crashes or slowing of the kindle. recommended for kids and adults.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|After watching seven seasons of Doctor Who within 3 months, I decided to check out the Torchwood series. For the most part, Torchwood is an awesome ride that I really enjoyed. Watched it all within a month, it's probably better this way. Season 1 will probably be more enjoyable when I go through and watch it again. It took me a while to really appreciate Gwen, I didn't dislike her but it seemed like the amount of time spent on Gwen's life outweighed the other team members. As sometime who already watched Doctor Who I'm curious if viewers were supposed to catch on to exactly who's hand was in that jar Jack had back when this first aired. My only real complaint is we never find out HOW exactly Jack ended up with the hand. Moving on, Torchwood season 1 was a lot of fun to watch, there are some darker episodes, the finale was absolutely great, the box set is beautiful. I'd recommend catching a rerun on BBC America or watching it for free somehow, somewhere before committing to buying the sets.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that it is a great game, but my brother is totally addicted. How did he get to level 347?!

B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This is a very fun movie for kids and adults. Reminds me of the animated Japanese cartoon 'Gigantor' that I used to watch as a kid, but a 1000 times better special effects. Once you suspend your belief into the world they are creating, it's good fun watching giant robots controlled by people save the world from huge monsters from another world.

1572815108|5.0|I bought this deck many years ago and used it until it was completely worn down. I was recently in the market for a new deck and every time I shopped around my mind kept coming back to this one. I couldn't wait to order it and the suspense waiting on it was well worth the time and money. I love this deck a lot. It's beautiful. It's insightful. It's perfect.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|I love this game and so does my three year old grandson. It's something he can do over and over and still enjoy. It's educational, teaches steps from preparing soil to planting. It's colorful, has cute pictures and sounds. You will be delighted and not mind helping them do it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love to bate this game. strangely addictive!! I have found it to be a great down time distraction.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The subject matter is burdened by much medical detail ,and lacks spiritual depth. I was surprised that the medical profession  is so narrow minded in its approach to problem solving.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game so much! The graphics are really awesome; and the weapons are really good. I DEFINATELY recommend this game to anyone who loves hunting games. It's cool how the predators actually try to kill you. Great game!
B003WUYR6I|4.0|Good book, couldn't wait for the end.  Only to be left hanging at the end.  Hope a sequel comes out soon.
B00000IZOR|3.0|My little boy loves to drag his phone around or have it pushed toward him to make the chatter noise.  However, I hate how short the blue cord is.  Look at the pictures next to it.  Even the models look awkward holding it up to their babies.  No babies are gonna have it at shoulder level to pick up the receiver.  It will be on the floor and when they pick it up the whole thing is going to come off the floor.  I don't know why some mention things lighting up in other review.  This thing is not electric at all.  No lights or batteries.  Maybe they got a different version.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|This is a fun little game. Nothing more, nothing less. It won't teach moral lessons, but it's innocent enough. It will teach good aim or the monkey suffers a sore head.
0061191981|5.0|Lots of fun to read. You can really &#34;hear&#34; the author's voice in the conversational writing style. I am a big fan of Kitchen Nightmares so it was interesting to get a little background on Gordon. He is not the monster portrayed on Hell's Kitchen.<br />The book moves along briskly and kept my interest.<br />I find the author to be honest and surprisingly forthright on personal subjects, like his brother's drug addiction and his feelings about his father.<br />Gordon is unsurprisingly apologetic in his views and writes about his life in a clear and engaging way.<br />I found this to be a quick and enjoyable read.

B0054PSY2W|1.0|Don't hate the movie, the movie is great, but the one that I received didn't work! I threw away the box and receipt because I'd never had a problem with anything from amazon before, and didn't think you could screw up a movie. A few weeks later we put the movie in to watch it and it just wouldn't work. It was like putting a blank disk in. Nothing happened. We tried it in a few different machines and made sure we had all of our settings correct, it was definitely the movie.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Read the whole book waiting for it to get good. Got to the end and was somewhat disappointed that this mediocre book has gotten so much hype. Will not be reading the remaining books in the trilogy.
1586210661|5.0|David Sedaris is an American humorist, essayist, comedian, author, and radio contributor – type his name into YouTube and be prepared to get lost in a vortex of his various bookstore appearances, Jon Stewart and Late Show guest-stars and any number of clips of him reading an essay to peeing-in-their-pants delighted crowd. He’s really, really funny and his autobiographical essay collections came highly-recommended when I let it be known that I was getting into “the audiobooks.” And it’s no wonder, because if you really want to have a fabulous listening experience it doesn’t get much better than a David Sedaris book, because he narrates all his own work. He has to – Sedaris has a high-pitched, lisped North Carolina accent that is surprisingly melodic, and after a few sentences I could not fathom an actor reading his essays and getting their tongues around his quirk storytelling (like singing TV commercials in an Etta James imitation, for example.)<br /><br />The run time is 5 hours and 51 minutes<br /><br />‘Me Talk Pretty One Day’ was his essay collection from 2000, based loosely around life-lessons; from the grand to the gross and everything in-between.<br /><br />In “Go Carolina”, David recounts the day his school speech therapist came for him and began, what would become, a series of torturous lessons to correct his ‘lazy tongue’ and lisp. This, despite the fact that the young speech therapist herself hailed from the Deep South and, as David disdainfully pointed out; “Here was a person for whom the word pen had two syllables.”<br /><br />Many of the stories are about the year that he moved to France with his boyfriend, Hugh, and had to enrol in beginner French and then harder French lessons. Sedaris describes his broken French tongue as him “speaking Yoda” but revels in the heady fear of being a stranger in a foreign land – things like going to the doctor and describing ailments in lousy French, or becoming the town idiot who only knows the French word for “bottleneck” so repeats it at every opportunity. My favourite of the ‘David in France’ stories had to be “Jesus Shaves”. Involving the recounting of a particular French class when the lesson plan was based around major holidays, and a Moroccan student had to be explained by her fellow classmates what Easter was. Aside from the cultural differences between bunnies and bells, describing the cornerstone of Christianity is hilariously hard to do when you know very little French.<br /><br />He nice, the Jesus. — “Jesus Shaves”<br /><br />The bulk of ‘Me Talk Pretty One Day’ is about Sedaris and his boyfriend Hugh, and Sedaris’ adventures in French. And no wonder when this chapter of his life was clearly a deep well for personal anecdote. Particularly because it involved the rare occasion of a grown man going back to school and learning the very basics of a new language. And, as many English-speakers who have studied foreign languages will know, a main headache of such learning is no thanks to gender;<br /><br />I find it ridiculous to assign a gender to an inanimate object incapable of disrobing and making an occasional fool of itself. Why refer to lady crack pipe or good sir dishrag when these things could never live up to all that their sex implied? — “Me Talk Pretty One Day”<br /><br />All of Sedaris’ stories are brilliantly funny, and he writes beautifully. Throughout my listening of the audiobook I was struck by certain thoughts and quotes that Sedaris delivers so as to linger. Even mundane musings on why he persists with the typewriter over a computer are delivered with sharp wit;<br /><br />At the end of a miserable day, instead of grieving my virtual nothing, I can always look at my loaded wastepaper basket and tell myself that if I failed, at least I took a few trees down with me. — “Nutcracker.com”<br /><br />But the reason I think David Sedaris is clearly a beloved author for so many (truly, heseems to have a cult-following status) is because he can have you in belly-aching tears one moment, and then ease you into poignancy. My favourite story of all was “The Youth in Asia” (the title is in reference to ‘euthanasia’ but Sedaris is struck by very different imagery when he initially hears the word). This story is initially a recounting of the Sedaris family pets and the histories of their deaths . . . but becomes about the loss of a parent. He read this story on the radio program ‘This American Life’and I highly recommend it for a listen. Likewise, it has appeared in Esquire. I think I fell a little bit in love with David Sedaris after hearing this story, as I think anyone would.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed my first encounter with David Sedaris, especially listening to his storytelling via audiobook. I was so enamoured, that when I typed ‘David Sedaris Australia’ into Google and found out he would be touring in January (doing a series of conversations and readings from his 2013 book, ‘Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls’) I snapped up two tickets for his Melbourne appearance.seems to have a cult-following status) is because he can have you in belly-aching tears one moment, and then ease you into poignancy.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is challenging and satisfying. It teaches spacial concepts. I like that it can be played without an internet connection, so one can enjoy it while waiting (for the corn to pop, dinner to be ready, or whatever life's got you waiting for). It has lots of levels and puzzles available.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|This book was... not what I expected. I mean this in the most wonderful way. I've never read any other books by Rainbow Rowell, but I've heard lovely things. So, when giving the opportunity to read Fangirl I jumped at the chance. But, I didn't expect for it to be anything more than a light, funny, read with the ability to be quite charming, but, what I got was so much more.<br /><br />Fangirl is one of those books that pulls you in and doesn't let go. You really love all the characters, and even the most secondary characters are truly well developed. You become Cath as she explores life outside her sister's shadow and life as a freshman in college. She has to make her way through life without Wren and you cheer her on as she realizes that she can do it. I, personally, loved reading about her roommate as well, and would love to see a sequel involving her. I feel like Rainbow Rowell really wrote a beautiful coming of age story in which Cath faces ups and downs but ultimately finds her way.<br /><br />**View all of my reviews at [...] and follow me on Twitter at [...]

When I become frustrated by a level, I'll go back and play easier levels for fun.  I'm still 3 levels from completion, and enjoying trying to pass them.<br /><br />Basically, Granny is a rollerskating racer.  She jumps, she uses her umbrella to zip-line, she rebounds, she floats, she throws baseballs.  After passing multiple levels, new avatars are unlocked:  a dog, a businessman, and a robot.<br /><br />Granny usually only skates left to right, unless an obstacle or jump changes her direction.  If you get stuck beyond redemption, the level will restart.  You can watch replays of your most recent performance, which helps you learn the course and is sometimes entertaining.<br /><br />A nice feature is that there are different goals you can meet in all levels.  One goal might be to just cross the finish line for the race.  Another goal would be to collect all the coins.  A third would be to collect all the apples.  Once you've crossed the finish line for a level, the next level will unlock for you to play, even if all goals are not met.  As you become skilled at the game, you can also make other challenges for yourself, such as staying just behind your race opponent or making marvelous, unscheduled maneuvers.<br /><br />Granny's trek takes you from the farm to the city to the industrial park to space.<br /><br />Nice graphics & gameplay.  Simple game.  Highly recommend.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|hey troll I would love to go to your bridges but lest talk about the app I watch my mom play it and it looks awesome the people that rated it one star might have the first amendment on there side but show some respect amazon just put this app on here and your going to give it a bad tarring even thought you know what the app is going to be like no heart.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great acting, good story line.  Sorry there is only 3 episodes for each season.  This show is much better than elementary.
B00AEBBA36|2.0|I have an interest in the history of the Vietnam War and have read the book of military history upon which this novel is supposedly based (that book is &#34;We Were Soldiers Once... and Young,&#34; by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore and Joseph Galloway). This film presents some historically accurate facts about a really interesting and historically important battle that took place early in the Vietnam War in a region of Vietnam known as the Ia Drang valley. (As a little sidebar, in Oliver Stone's film &#34;Platoon,&#34; from 1986, the character Sgt. Elias, played by Willem Dafoe, is a veteran soldier who is on his 3rd tour of duty; one of those tours was with the 1st Cavalry Division Airmobile [aka, &#34;the Cav&#34;]; this is indicated by a shoulder insignia (or &#34;flash&#34;) that he wears. The soldiers fighting in the battle that is dramatized in the movie &#34;We Were Soldiers&#34; belonged to the Cav [specifically, the soldiers in the film belonged to the 7th Cavalry Regiment -- which historically was the regiment that Custer led at the Little Big Horn. The 7th Cavalry belonged to the 3rd Brigade of the Cav -- the so-called Garryowen Brigade. In the film &#34;Little Big Man&#34; [from 1970], there are several scenes in which units of the Garryowen Briade are attacking while a drum and fife band plays the Garryown Song.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film &#34;We Were Soldiers&#34; presents only a smattering of the facts of the battle that took is described in detail in Gen. Moore's and Joseph Galloway's book. The film restricts itself to the fight at the base of the Chu Pong Massif (ie, the fight for landing zone X-ray). It ignores all together the disaster that struck US forces the day after the fighting at LZ X-ray, as those forces were marching overland to a position referred to as landing zone Albany. During that overland march, hundreds of US soldiers were overrun by North Vietnamese Army forces. This so-called &#34;massacre&#34; is described in detail in the book &#34;We Were Soldiers Once... and Young.&#34;<br /><br />Gen. Moore's and Joseph Galloway's book is a great, great book of military history (and, what perhaps is most important, it is a great book of human drama, courage, sacrifice, comradeship, and duty). But the movie &#34;We Were Soldiers&#34; doesn't  measure up to the book. And this is regrettable. The events that book place in the Ia Drang valley in November 1965 warrant more (that is, a truly factual presentation, not a fanciful patriotic gesture).
B004742Y40|5.0|GIVE ME......A KEG.... OF BEER !!!!!!!!!<br /><br />&#34;Three Things&#34; speech by The Coach is classic.<br /><br />Great movie from the 80's that is suitable for the whole family.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I don't usually write reviews (even for my favorite author's books) but i felt compelled to do so here because of the amount of hate Veronica seems to be getting. I loved everything about this book it was not boring (and trust me, i get bored severely easily while reading) and the ending was absolutely phenomenal.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Great movie for those that like Science Fiction. Very fast paced and entertaining. Very realistic and bonus features also add to the entire package as it is very interesting how they created this movie.  Unbelievably realistic!
006202406X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought that what was outside the fence was a nice twist. At first I was really disappointed about the ending because, like everyone else, I wanted Tris and Tobias to end up together. HOWEVER, after sleeping on it, I believe that Tris' sacrifice was an excellent twist. I definitely didn't think she would die, and then after she did I realize that it was for all the right reasons [unlike if it had happened in Insurgent].<br /><br />I hate to compare the two universes, but it reminds me a lot of the ending of The Hunger Games, both series show the YA genre that their protagonists don't always live a complete &#34;happily ever after&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Seriously, I couldn't imagine watching youtube on a TV without this anymore. Whenever we're at a friends house and want to share a youtube video - it takes forever to use their TV's smart remote to cue things up - and we always talk about how cool the Chromecast is and how it works with your computer, laptop, ipad, iphone and even android phone.<br /><br />Warning: make sure you don't try to connect to it with multiple phone at a time! With two, it's ok, but with 3 it starts to act wonky.<br /><br />Product Innovation: I wish they made it HDMI powered rather than requiring an outlet. Then I could throw it in my pocket and take it with to friends houses or just have one on a keychain. But I'm not lugging a power adapter.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This film is based on the tenth novel of author Patrick O'Brian's so-called Aubrey-Maturin series of historical novels about naval warfare during the Napoleonic war (there were a total of 20 such novels all together). I have an interest in military history and have read volumes 1 through 18 of that series of novels by O'Brian. Of all the war movies that I have seen, this one is perhaps my favorite. Not only does the screenplay do justice to O'Brian's novel, the acting, casting, cinematography, and special effects are first rate (Russell Crowe was especially well cast as Captain Jack Aubrey). In the novels, the sensitive relationship between Captain &#34;Lucky Jack&#34; Aubrey and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin is well presented. But because this film did not do well at the box office, no future film adaptations of O'Brian's novels are likely to be forthcoming, and so the relationship between O'Brian and Maturin will not be further developed in future film versions of O'Brian's story. (In addition to being a naturalist and an outstanding trauma surgeon, Maturin is also a highly effective intelligence operative [ie, a spy] -- a fact that is only briefly alluded to in this film.)  Nor will Jack's bittersweet relationship with his wife, Sophia, be developed. The fact that none of these relationships and none of these dimensions of Jack's and Stephen's characters will be developed further in future film versions of O'Brian's story is regrettable. All that being said, as war films go, this little movie is as good as it gets.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Nice to have a movie to overcome adversity rather than pure stimulus and violence. Thought it was good father ad son adventure.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Must have for fans of the original series. Reasonably priced and beautifully packaged, this is a perfect gift for those of us who remember and still appreciate where it all began.
B004FHP9KA|2.0|Very slow to start into action and it leaves you confused until the actual dreams start and then you catch on. Also, while the ending was cool, it still disappointed the viewer.
0399157573|5.0|As a female in my young twenties, I just started getting into the Scarpetta series and I seriously cannot put these down, they are too good! Patricia Cornwell's writing brings me to another place- wow! Dust is an excellent read!
0307951529|5.0|While the concepts aren't that technical or anything too revealing, it presents points that when taken as a whole can challenge you in your startup and encourage you not to accept the status quo. Quick read, good points, definitely some good conversations after reading it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great spin on an old classic. Works well on a Galaxy S II. Touchscreen controls are very natural. Really brings you back in time.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|THE BEST BOOK I have ever read! Highly recommend it and I hope everyone enjoys reading it the same way as I have.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart was different from my usual YA reads but I loved it.  The action started on the very first page and didn't let up for the entire book.  It made for a very fast-paced and exciting read!<br /><br />The premise of the Epics: ordinary people who developed superpowers after Calamity (I'm still not sure but I think Calamity was a star), was really interesting.  I liked how there were lots of Epics, all different kinds, and not just one person with a superpower.  The idea of the Epics ruling America was terrifying.  Sanderson's world-building was perfect: he wove the history of the Epics into the story, so there were no slow parts at the beginning of the book.<br /><br />David wants to kill Newcago's (previously Chicago) ruling Epic: Steelheart.  Steelheart's name depicts his powers: he is strong, invincible, and can turn things to steel.  He turned all of Chicago to steel in what's called the Transfersion.  The imagery describing the cold, dark, gray Newcago was exceptional.  Not only is Chicago now made of steel, another Epic called Nightwielder has turned Newcago into a state of permanent darkness.  What a bleak, scary place to live!  Anyone who offends the Epics (there are several ruling under Steelheart) in any way is killed.  The Epics are in complete control of the city's resources and people.<br /><br />David has devoted his life to studying the Epics and devising plans to kill them.  Steelheart killed David's father and David wants revenge.  He learns of the Reckoners, a group devoted to killing Epics, and wants to join them.  The Reckoners come to Newcago and David devises a plan to meet up with them.  I enjoyed the camaraderie of David and the Reckoners.  They were a devoted, loyal team and I liked that they joined together and David found his purpose in that way.<br /><br />But what made Steelheart so great were the plot twists throughout the story.  Every time I thought I knew where Sanderson was taking the plot, things would change and I was continually surprised.  I love that!  The characters were very well-developed, and I grew to care about the Reckoners, more than I expected to.  I often find character development lacking in sci-fi, but not so in Steelheart.<br /><br />My one complaint about Steelheart was that there was more fighting than I personally like, but it did fit the story.  The fight scenes were long yet well-depicted.  I think they would appeal more to the male readership than they did to me.<br /><br />Overall, I loved Steelheart and look forward to the next book in the series.  Sanderson ended the book with a big surprise and I'm really excited to see what happens next in book two!ually surprised.  I love that!  The characters were very well-developed, and I grew to care about the Reckoners, more than I expected to.

B00G32VYDG|1.0|Story line was familiar MIB. Execution was shotty. Characters were fun but all in all an unimpressive film. Could have been much better.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|outstanding selection of songs performed with the &#34;off the charts&#34; talent of The Piano Guys<br />really got me in the Holiday spirit
B001GKJ2F2|4.0|The storyline is kind of out there, but that's what a fantasy-action type film is.  James McAvoy is very believable as a loser-turned assassin in this film.  The action is what makes this film great.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Another great book by two great authors.  One of their best books with all the twists, turns and excitement a reader could want.  Highly recommend this book as well as all their books to anyone who enjoys great writing, a great story and wonderful characters.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry birds AND Star Wars? Why are you even bothering to read this review? Of course it's a good way to spend your 99 cents and your time in the waiting room. Works great on a Kindle Fire and an Android phone.

B000FL7CAK|4.0|CW made a bad decision to cancel the series, but thankfully there's DVD to help fans re-watch the series.  Veronica is again investigating a major mystery, while also solving smaller crimes.  She's balancing her love life between Logan and that drip, Duncan.  Great acting from this cast again.
1401917232|5.0|Gary Renard is on an amazing ride.  Gary, who I might add, is hardly extraordinary on the surface, has become the catalyst of two ascended masters who are giving us the most extraordinary information on spirituality there is out there.  Ironically, here is this rather crass, beer-drinking, uneducated, low-energy average guy, digging deep within to become probably one of the most important spiritual portals ever to walk on the earth plane.  I have a lot in common with Gary as I too experienced myself with Werner Erhard's est in the mid 80's which led to an assosication with &#34;A Course in Miracles&#34;.  &#34;A Course in Miracles&#34;, when truly understood, is the most important information of our time.  It is Jesus' second coming in book form.  The problem with it, it is not easy to understand.  My ego has put up many obstacles to elude its message.  Then comes Gary with the help of his two ascended masters, Arten & Pursah, and clears up the intended meaning.  And I saw Gary transform from a shy awkward lost soul in the 90's evlove into a powerful important spiritual teacher.  &#34;Love Has Forgotten No One&#34; is a must read as are his other two preceeding books.  As a musician and for who you are, you rock!  Thanks for your contribution and keep the love flowing.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|Can be fun, but goes too fast, often have all but one square early on but never hit a bingo.  I don't get how some people win after three numbers drawn, even with an instant win, you'd need four numbers....something a little off about that.  Rewards are a little cheap too.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is very well thought out and fun. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to hunt in exotic locations and would never otherwise get to do so.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Even though we were given 'Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection\\" and the \\"Part of Me\\" movie I must say this album was definitely worth the wait. One thing Katy Perry is good at doing is delivering what you expect: Fun heart-felt pop music. It doesn't matter if her lyrics are deep as the Pacific Ocean because she knows what she is doing and puts all her heart into it. One of the more genuine celebrities out today.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Most of the tale takes place in a Mississippi court room or in preparation for litigation of a will. The will was hand written by a dying man who hanged himself at the beginning of the tale. Seth gave his large estate to his black housekeeper that he has known for only three years, and clearly cut out his self centered dis-functional family..<br /><br />Then the legal war begins.If you are not passionate about courtroom drama, this will be a lengthy slog.

159315724X|5.0|Great book! I highly recommend reading this book if you are a business owner or are looking for and easy motivational read.
B00000G3I2|5.0|So much has been written by this film that I hesitate to add my words.  'Just to say that it's still wonderful after all these years.  It touched a nerve, the idealism of a generation of students who were going to change the world and then they didn't so much.  I think one of the things that makes this movie so watchable is that it touched the hearts of the superb cast and their performances really shine.<br /><br />This is a story about a particular time and set of people but somehow it transcends those limitations.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an awesome game filled with obstacles and awesome way to pass the time! Don't listen to bad reviews!!!!!

0399157573|1.0|SHAME ON YOU PATRICIA CORNWELL  and YOU TOO AMAZON FOR EXPLOITING THE SANDY HOOK, CT TRAGEDY.  There is no excuse.  I WAS looking forward to this book but this is the last Cornwell book for me. To use that tragedy for profit in inexcusable.  It appears in in the opening pages and although I have not (and will not) read the rest of the book, I did look for Connecticut and Sandy Hook references and they are throughout the book.  I had hoped there might be a foreword or other reference to the proceeds going to some charity but that's not there either.  And you, Amazon... you are just as bad for allowing that misuse of a horrible tragedy to occur on your site and for not identifying this detail in sales info.  I'll be returning the book and expecting a full refund, including shipping since I don't want either party to benefit from this.  I'm upset by both of your lack's of ethics.
0143113100|5.0|Incredible book with thought-provoking and fascinating information!  Written clearly and directed to the layman but does not dumb down the science, just makes it very accessible.  I have recommended it to everyone I know interested in how our brains work.
B00FCAK12A|5.0|There are very few albums on which every track is a good song.  The songwriting for this album is so good that you can't tell what &#34;the good songs are supposed to be&#34; other than if you look the singles that were released (Ruin, 11th Hour, Vigil).  I can't go 2 minutes of listening to any song on this album without feeling a rush of adrenaline and optimism.  Lyrically, each song paints a picture of the harshest unfiltered reality faced by the artists at the time of they were written.  The thoughts shared by vocalist Randy Blythe are effectively confrontational, destructive, and full of clear purpose for the listener. LoG provide zero shortage of offerings to their audience on this album from start to finish.<br /><br />About the mixing of the 10 year edition, I will say this: If you listen to a lot of underground music, then your ears will be adjusted to the original and you may view this remix as unnecessary and possibly a Pandora's Box opened to a &#34;volume war&#34; within the loudened mix.  Those of you who don't listen to a lot of underground music but are looking to expand their catalog of heavy music should really hear this mix.  It will sound more like how people have come to expect this kind of music to sound.  The key to figuring out which version you will like is that expectation is everything.  Underground music recordings don't give much in the way of production and instead leave their audience blown away by the songs.  The new mix allows the listener to be blown away by both the production and the songs.
B00B4804KS|5.0|You get what you expect and maybe more. I review 3-D and if this was a new movie I might find something to criticize but that is not the case. I did not expect that much from this so on my 60 inch screen I was jumping and shouting with delight. If you got butterflies from this in its original form be prepared for real motion as far as your brain is concerned. While there is not a lot of extras they take it that extra step so the special features is also 3-D and you do not have to change disk.

0399157573|5.0|I picked this up the other day because, I don't know why actually.  I have head some great things about Patricia Cornwell.  I'm not a huge reader of novels, nor have I read any Scarpetta books (thought it was a women's romance novel series haha). I am a young guy, and a buddy of mine suggested I read some of this.  Wow, this is no cheap romance stuff here.  I'm not finished with it yet but I wanted to post how impressed I am so far and thankful my buddy recommended picking up a book like this.  Guys, start reading this. I dare ya.  You're gonna be surprised and keep reading!  Thanks Patricia for wowing a man like myself.

0385537131|4.0|As usual  Mr Grisham's words were flowing.  There is a lot going on in that book. Being a person who usually only reads before going to sleep, I stayed up late several nights. Plus found a few afternoons to pick it up.  You know a book is good when you are thinking about it during the day. I enjoyed the book very much.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I hit the wrong star.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I bought this twice.<br />some of the songs were disappointing bc I didn't understand EXACTLY what I was buying this is basically unreleased practice material and demo versions of songs. so you actually can hear how the song develops.<br />this is good to have for you Michael Jackson collection espassially because theres music on here that only the fans know about. now people are releasing them and its like &#34;that's old&#34; haha

B009A9SULS|5.0|I LOVE the Kobo Mini!<br />For those of you who, like me, want an ereader that doesn't constant send notifications from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, and other forms of social media, then the Kobo Mini is just for you!<br />For me, it makes the reading experience much better. I tap on a book, it opens, I swipe the screen to flip the page, and read until the end of the book! It has a WiFi option, which is great for buying books and updating the firmware. And the screen display closely resembles paper, and doesn't have colour. Some people think the ereader sucks because it doesn't have colour, but to me that's just another &#34;plus&#34; to the ereader.<br />The battery life of this product is INCREDIBLE. I can charge it at the start of the month, run it every day during the month, and charge it at the start of the next month*<br />*sometimes it had to be charged BEFORE the end of the month, and sometimes it lasted EVEN LONGER*<br />I love reading books on my ereader; it's so much easier than carrying physical books with me, and I can take all of my books with me all the time instead of picking and choosing which book(s) I take with me... because I always like to have a book everywhere I go!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|What can I say? Michael Connelly remains one of the two best contemporary writers of crime fiction in America. While I don't always like Harry Bosch, I admire his integrity, and Connelly does an excellent job of developing his character. As always, a good story well told.
1400031001|5.0|Set against the epochal events of the last century, this book is a moving portrayal of how a man manages to retain his honor even as war, reversals of fortune, and privation force him into betrayals and compromises at every turn.

630471193X|5.0|On the sad side.  John Travolta and Kyra Sedgwick are great together.  Travolta goes from a very normal person to someone that can learn a foreign language in 10 minutes. He can't sleep and reads 10 books a day.  There is very sad reason this is happening to him.  Highly recommend this for the family.

B0045HCJRG|5.0|This is a Great movie! Heartwarming, funny and such a brilliant cast. I actually ordered multiple copies to give as gifts.
9382951008|4.0|Well written, it was engaging and moved along well, interesting perspective gave insight to history of area and social norms
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'm honestly not a James Bond fan, never have been. However Skyfall was incredibly well written. James Bond finally has a decent film, and it's one I plan on purchasing in the near future.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This is for all the peeps that said one star.IT IS A GOOD GAME BUT WHERE ARE TE UPDATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />AND WERE IS THE STUFF REDSTONE AND GUESS WHAT DIAMOND FORGET ABOUT IT
B0039O8AQK|4.0|I just about gave this 5 stars, pretty close. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.  The nudity is just a little bit over-done, no big deal.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Funny, cute and great movie all around!  Would recommend for any adult kid or kids age 5 and over...  Make sure to watch Monster's Inc. first!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Its great but part of the text for logging in to facebook is missing so I cant log on to facebook plz fix
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best app ever all kind of seasons<br />Plus glitches you can ho through its just so cool dude ha ha
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing the game but I hate having to wait for more lives ill be deep into playing and run out of lives and have to wait half an hour to get more lives.
1452126577|5.0|More than just the regular sayings, although Grumpy's wisdom is as pithy as Proverbs and more true these days, the Grumpy Cat book has all kinds of humorous, grumpy wit including how-to guides, travel commentaries, and I just can't give away the rest, it's too good! If you love Grumpy Cat, you HAVE to buy this book!!!
B00GINENG0|5.0|You should totally get this game! I check on my little kitten every day. I will recommend this game to children. Get this app, ASAP!
B004I744AS|4.0|It helps me a lot with words I don't know and more. It even helps me with my study guide and it is really easy to use.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I went to Rod's concert a few weeks ago and it was fabulous!  He sang many of his former hits as well as some songs from this album.  I knew I had to purchase it and it does not disappoint.  Rod still has it!  The songs are a story if his life.  My favorite is Pure Love.  It would be the perfect song for a wedding dance with the bride and her dad and the groom and his mom.  The song reflects how I feel about my son every day.  The rest of the music just makes me smile!  I grew up with Rod and he just keeps getting better and better.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is hard but it's good for your brain to think it's like a brain work out I like it so I can be smarter I encourage you guys that are reading this to download this app right now
0545265355|3.0|I bought this for my daughter.  I also listened to them on audio.  I hated them, my daughter and her family loved them.  To each his own I guess!
B00GINENG0|5.0|This app is so funny it is like my own cat :D u should make more like this I don't know Wat else to say
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khalid Hosseini does that magical thing where he takes the reader from their comfortable modern home to a world and time most of us have never seen. A wonderful read about life and what tears us apart often binds us together. Can't wait for the next story!
1619699826|5.0|The Harry Bosch series is one of my favorites. ANGELS FLIGHT is just one more gem in the collection. I recommend this and all of the Harry Bosch novels. Once you read this one, I'm sure you too will be reading them all and agreeing...
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you thought the HBO series was detailed and well thought out wait till you read this. It goes into far more detail and tells a lot more stories (including several characters just eliminated from the tv series). While I enjoyed this greatly, be warned at times this attention to detail can make he story drag on much like the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy so if you aren't one to read those kind if books stick to the excellent tv version.<br /><br />In short well worth reading if your a fan of the tv series.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|One of  many of Johnny Depp's good movies.  Nice fun romance.  I really like it and so does my husband.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|get this game you wont be dissapointed. there are SOO many levels. This game is great. the metal levels are my favourite!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Because im awesome is y i think im a beast or in other words number 1 so have fun guys
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|I purchased this headset to use with the Playstation 4, because this was the nicest one that popped up on Amazon when doing a search for PS4 headsets.  I bought this with intentions of being 100% wireless, which you currently CAN'T do with the PS4 with this headset.  For some reason the PS4 doesn't support this headset syncing via Bluetooth.  You have to use an audio cable (which is included thankfully), which connects to the bottom of the headset and then connects to the controller very similar to how the Xbox 360 headsets work.<br /><br />So, long story short this works great for the PS4 and is an excellent headset, but if you plan on using this for voice chat then you won't be able to be 100% wireless.  Excellent headset, but that cable seems unnecessary.  I'm hoping for an update that allows this to sync via Bluetooth at some point.
0824835921|5.0|This book was recommended to my son, who is studying Japanese in college, from another graduate in the program. He said it makes learning Kanji so much easier then the traditional methods of teaching it. Saved him countless hours of studying and makes it all make sense.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|New interpretations of his songs are always welcome from Dylan. I love the version of Went to see the gypsy.<br />I do wish he had released  Pretty Saro  many years ago so that I could have been enjoying it all these years.<br />IT'S ALL GOOD
067144901X|2.0|The pictures are adorable, and the story is cute, but it only mentions the pigs singing one time at the beginnins, so just ok...the title made me think this story was going in a different direction, but my toddler liked it...
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this app often to tell me the weather to see how it may affect my plans. It's pretty much always right, plus there are cool little interesting videos like on the actual Weather Channel. There is a bonus, though sometimes annoying but are kinda cool, mpoints, you can earn these for sweepstakes and what have you. Anyways, if you just need weather, there is probably simpler functional apps, but this app is pretty cool and reliable.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Finally came in the mail today. Stryper's best ever! Michael can hit all the high notes. Oz & Michael dual guitar solos are amazing. Finally the production lets you hear how great Tim is as a bass player. And Robert is still a beast on the drums. The writing & the message was powerful/heartfelt.<br /><br />These guys are true professionals.<br /><br />My favorite was Marching into Battle. Can't wait to hear it in concert...
0399157573|5.0|As my new interest in crime novels emmerged I was led to Cornwell's enlightening Scarpetta series. Being sick of the over use and run down dramatic novels I decided to lean towards a more scientific and suspensful approach. I found myself in awe and submerged in this series! Cornwell's captivating detail provides proof of her knowledge and makes it impenetrable to scrutiny. I have not been able to finish Dust, however putting it down has been hard and the end is unfortunately drawing near! Patricia's reference to the CT terror was touching and therapeutic for both me and I believe her as well. Yes, it was a horrible disaster but this particular reference was not about the case itself but about how it affected people so much so that it found its way into a fictional world. Kay Scarpetta caries the weight of those children much like we do in &#34;real life&#34; and I do not think it should it should impede people from reading it. Patricia Cornwell creates a cloud, or Dust if you will, that encompasses a &#34;real&#34; emotion in a dark aura that is crime. Truly loved the book and anticipation is an understatement for her next release! Keep it up Cornwell your words are inspiring!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. Can't wait for their next novel, they are great writers on their own or together.
0671449028|5.0|We like this author, and purchased this for our newly turned 2 yr old for her birthday. She loves it. It has really cute pictures and is all about this group of animals on a ship, who are getting ready for bed...they do all of the familiar bedtime things that a child would relate too, plus some things like exercise on the top deck, etc. This was a hit and the illustrations, as usual, are adorable.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Its nice because it really does loads of help for kids I think it helps them find out words they don't know and it helps them with school work
B00E9A656K|5.0|it a good game. I love it . I just think that they should stop with the gas Its no fun when u race and then.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome!! Can't wait for more levels. The rooms are hard but not so that you finally give up and look for the you tube cheats.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|This game is amazing to play but for us kindle users it stinks. Everyone else gets the new updates two to three days before us and it costs time on the special .missions and we lose friends because we can't help them. Not sure if this is the fault of the game maker or Amazon but it's horrible to wait. Other than that it's addicting and fun with lots of missions and rewards.
006029129X|5.0|My kids all love Harold and the Purple Crayon...we've been reading these books for years! I highly recommend them, as they are simple, yet have more intricate stories woven in...I highly recommend this to anyone with children between the ages of 2-7 or so...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive. Play for hours without getting bored or having to spend additional money to continue. Scenes very challenging and interesting.
B002XG1OUE|3.0|The phaser is not as crisply moulded as the 2009 version, and there are issues with the manufacturing, Mine has the bit underneath the barrel glued on out of true.<br />I'm keeping it as there are reports of much worse issues...Check the internet for more.<br /><br />The film is a great transfer, and replicated what I saw in the Theatre.<br /><br />Paramount should be kicked somewhere sensitive for what they did with the Bonus Features (Retailer exclusives mean you can't get all the bonus features without a detective style hunt). The worst marketing of Bonus Features since Prometheus, although Prometheus is still at the top of the heap.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|They are both brilliant games that stimulate and also helps with spelling as well as hand eye co-ordination,<br />which is good for stimulating the brain and cognitive skills.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dr Sleep<br /><br />this is an awesome read, typical King keeping me on edge the entire book and will read it again
B0035LGXXO|4.0|This movie was Walter Hill all the way.  Non-stop in your face action, causing you to sympathize with the protagonists. A cult favorite from the late 70's, has always been a favorite.
B0027MJU00|4.0|if you liked gone girl you will enjoy this!!! slightly grim but entertaining. it was hard to put down !
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great app. Easy to use.  Has many translations of the Bible which is really useful. Extra features, such as notes, highlighting, sharing handpicked scripture option via media. LOVE IT
B0001I561E|5.0|Movie is in excellent conditions. I played it several times for my kids and works great.<br />My kids love it, it was a great buy play it several times for my kids and works great !!!!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I can't believe it's finally on the Amazon store. I've been waiting for so long for it to come out. It is almost exactly like the pc and console versions and it has the bosses from the pc and console. If you like it on either of those you're going to love this.
B001VTTRC6|4.0|Clint Eastwood has done yet another great job from the director's chair !!!  Who would have thought that &#34;Dirty Harry&#34; would become such a great director.  With the ensemble cast, and well written script, this movie is Clint and cast at their best !!
B007PFD90G|4.0|The book is very well written as any book by Rushdie is but the whole drama becomes uninteresting and boring.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Good for saving yourself notes if you have so many things to keep up with. Very useful in reminding you of anything you forgot.
0525478817|3.0|This book is mostly directed towards a young adult reader, but I will say that anyone any age can read this and still appreciate such a well written story. This book made me cry. I'm an avid reader and I've read many books, but this one is the only one that has ever made me cry so much. The characters are a little out there, as in, their personalities cannot be related to most teens but they're adorable nonetheless. Definitely recommend.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Remarkable story of Mr. Lin, If it's true than this person has lived a life which is beyond imagination. Worth a readout you need to be an Indian to have a feel of it
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Denzel is the premier actor of the last 20 years. This movie opens up yet another facet of a truly dynamic actor.
0393064476|5.0|The author leads us smoothly through the history of the Middle Ages in this wonderful account of the search for a revolutionary manuscript.
B001KWZ796|5.0|After all these years I still love watching this movie. ITs full of hateful sister & step mother drama and the love a prince that finally turns out wonderful. Everyone should have such a great dream and it come true. But life is not a fairy tale, lord know some of it should be.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I don't know what book you people are reading but this one does a pretty good job of being pretentious AND obnoxious in the face of some pretty serious history. Is it a kids book and you are all in middle school?<br />How do you NOT write something profound with this subject matter? How did the author manage to keep his characters so one dimensional?<br />Three stars, it was worth the two dollars and ninety cents I paid for it...barely.
1423136802|5.0|A beautiful box, the five books come in perfect state! The cover are the old ones, but it is still very good! The paper quality is good, it is not that white paper that makes our reading difficult. The paper is the yellow one, rough, and strong, this make your reading flow because because your eyes do not get tired.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|very basic! I wish it had a few more features :)  but other than that its good for simple math problems
B004LROUW2|2.0|I read to the end waiting to see what the point of this book was...and there wasn't one.<br />Was I supposed to like the characters? I didn't. What was the point of the religion? What did the little people tell them? The characters,and there were many, were developed as if they were important to the story, but most were not. I am convinced that Some of them were put in so there could be more sex.<br />The many pages dedicated to Tengo's father dying were pointless. The knocking by the collection agent at the door was never explained.<br />Too many hours of my life I will never get back.
B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|Oh this movie may be very fictitious but very much full of adventure and excitement and never know what's coming at you from around the corner and Jeremy Renner & costar did an excellent job at putting adventure into this movie.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It is an awesome game to go with the fantastic theme song.  :)  If you haven't played you should! it's fun but challenging.
B00000IZOR|2.0|The Phone cord was too short for my 11 month old to even have the receiver till her ears even after sitting..  rest other seems to be Ok.. but we are not that excited and i recommend a better one.. planning to return this.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I'm a fan of  the nature sounds, however the dreams sound loop is nice. I would prefer longer loops, perhaps the sounds of nature from different parts of the world. I use this app almost every night to drift off to sleep rather than drown out other noise. It's well worth three bucks. I left off one star because the loops are a bit short. Using Kindle Fire HD.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I think I am the only one in the world who liked &#34;Superman Returns &#34; a film in which Bryan Singer gave Superman human emotions and sexuality, he was no longer a Ken doll and Lois was no longer &#34;The Girl&#34; .  Kate Bosworth was a really good Lois Lane.  When I heard that Amy Adams was going to be Lois Lane I kind of thought oh no flakey again even though I know she can really stretch her self, I am thinking of &#34;The Fighter&#34;.  When I saw &#34;Man of Steel&#34;  I thought of course Amy Adams is Lois Lane.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie.  I really like Henry Cavill and I thought Perry White played by Lawrence Fishburn was the mirror image of Frank Langella in &#34;Superman Returns&#34;.  Anyway I have read a lot of reviews knocking the film, and I have read those who follow the graphic Superman who loved this film.  I found myself completely mesmerized by the technology that created this film, and found myself feeling grateful for the people who make this stuff happen.  A special shout out to Diane Lane who I can believe turned into Eva Marie Saint, Superman's Earth Mom.  I also like the &#34;S&#34; means hope.
0316204366|3.0|It's not my favorite Malcolm Gladwell book but ti's still pretty good. It gets a little long though the middle, otherwise a good book.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|After reading Ender's Game, I was eager to read the next installment on Ender. This story is full of surprises, moral and honest without pedantry. I cried towards the end of the second to last chapter. Ender finds new friends and a new purpose. I strongly recommend reading to author's preface. It puts in perspective why Speaker is so different from what one would expect from a reluctant hero, and so perfect. I'm ready for the next book! Where has this author been all my days of reading fantasy and sci-fi?!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I confess that morbid curiosity is what led me to read this but afterwards I wished I could un-read it.<br />I have no problems at all with the sexual themes...what offends me is how badly this is written.<br />It reads like something a teenager on the verge of discovering hormones would think is sexy.<br />Overall I wish I'd given all 3 books a miss. Satisfying my curiosity to see what others thought was so enthralling was NOT worth it!<br />Take out the so-called sexy bits and it's no better than a badly written &#34;tween&#34; love story that could have been covered in 100 pages or less.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I have watched this movie at least 1 time every week. I totally recommend it! Absolutely recommended!
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|NIN/Trent Reznor has always been one of my favorite bands. The first time I listened through Hesitation Marks I wasn't sure if I liked it, but it has grown on me. In addition I caught NIN in concert (Nov 2013). He performed a lot of the songs on the album and it was awesome live, super progressive. It's be fun watching NIN evolve over the years (as a lot of his fans have).
B009AMAJPA|3.0|I really liked this movie.  I drew me in...until the last 30 minutes.  It went from interesting to p-r-e-d-i-c-t-a-b-l-e.  Noomi Rapace was great in this.  Colin Farrell never looked hotter.  It was just so anti-climactic.  I expected a surprising finish maybe?  But I groaned out loud when I saw the way the movie was ending...  Then I pretty much went from 4 stars to &#34;it's okay.&#34;
B001TH16DI|5.0|Hubby and I are both major Star Trek fans and had previously purchased a couple of these movies on &#34;stand alone&#34; Blu-Ray disks.<br />The superior quality of this set blows the older ones away!<br />Both video and audio out-perform the others and any Star Trek fan would love this set.
B00ECR7KX2|3.0|Does not quite give me the real &#34;English &#34; feeling.Have seen the &#34;proper&#34; version and this is the &#34;light&#34; version<br />I missed more flow  in the whole production.The cast and crew had a difficult task,and all in all they did a ok job with what they had.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I so love listening to the piano and to hear some favorite renditions played anew was enjoyable.  Nice to listen to anytime of the day.  \\"Begin Again\\"  is now one of my favorites.  This is a fabulous song !!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Enjoy playing. Wish would update faster between regions. Have to hunt slot to make enough money. Makes it interesting to play.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|What can I say except that I hadn't read the book since I got it in paperback ages ago and it was a real treat to read it again on my Kindle Fire.<br />To those who have seen the movies but never read the first novel....do yourself a favor and dive right in.<br />There's so much more content than covered in the movie. Of course the ratings and standards at that time never would have permitted a lot of it! Not that it's salacious...but what got left out in the movie really helps you understand the characters' motivations better.<br />Go ahead...you know you want to.
1400164257|4.0|The book is entertaining, exiting,and fun .For those of us following Castle on TV ,it is very nice to sort of know the people in the book.
B00CEF014E|5.0|A hard book to put down. Dana is a fascinating, complex heroine. We don’t know whether to trust her or not but we want to badly. The idea makes for an incredibly suspenseful read. I had goosebumps all the way through. A perfect little thriller.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|All I really need to say is that this is the best app ever! all the armour/ and enamys.  so freaking epic.<br />get this app now and I promise you you will enjoy it very much!!!!!!!!!! oh and its free double the awesome. hope ypu enjoy good by Iron man fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0037TPGG4|5.0|great movie.  Not much in the way of interviewing or insight into the team, but the live sessions are great.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is incredible, looks great fits great, shipped fast.  Got what I wanted and more.  Thanks for this beauty. Woot
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I loved this. It’s like James Bond but much cooler. Reminded me of ‘Indiana Jones’ and ‘The English Patient.’ There are so many great lines in here. This book is going to be a movie, I know it. A wonderful read.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|Fun add addictive, great for all ages, different challenges, great claymation. A concept that will continue to be great with updates and more levels
B0002TKFGS|3.0|For those who love John Denver, no matter what, I’m sure that this will be a fine addition to their collection.<br /><br />However, I was looking for a Greatest Hits compilation of the songs as I remember them, not as they’ve been re-imagined, with alternate vocals, mixes and takes.<br /><br />Granted, Denver seems have always been disappointed with his originally released versions of his songs, enough to go back and re-record them and release them on other compilations.  But this is different . . . still John Denver, still singing the familiar songs, but, again, NOT the original versions that I expected.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|great game. would recommend! !! if u love hidden object games u will love this. I love the quest and the graphics.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Personally, I enjoyed WWZ enough not to be angry that it wasn't &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34;. It's pointless to critique this movie by measuring it against the classic, much better, zombie films that exist.  The book is amazing. The movie isn't.  But that didn't stop me from being entertained by it. I will say, I'm a big fan of 3D movies in theaters and I thought the 3D here was just awful.
0596009208|3.0|I enjoyed the fun aspect that this book provided for learning Java. This isn't your traditional reference book and that is what drew me toward this book. I enjoyed reading this book, but I felt like there were a few holes in the book.
B004FS27JK|5.0|great hits from a great artist!! She will be missed and now that I have this cd I know I can listen to her when ever I want.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|I think this was the best of the three movies, with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones at their best working together. A good time travel story is worth a go to all.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It came right on time, and quickly.<br /><br />However, I HATE the way that even though I chose NOT to answer these questions by just ignoring the pop-ups, you kept on sending those pop-ups to answer them until I did!<br /><br />So now that I've answered your questions, STOP ALREADY! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It is always hard to read the last book in the series because you don't want it to end. You don't want your friends dying and the need to change everything. Of course we have to thank the author for the brave way she dealt with Tris and of course Tobias or Four. He showed grief was real and okay. He had friends to give him help and guide him back to living.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone I could not put it down it is simply amazing. The best book I have ever read. No words can describe it you just need to read it.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Fantastic album from a great band. Always nice to have music with good beat, good lyrics and fun without being simple-minded pablum.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|Hey Its Sunnydale Chick here! FINALLY, some more people who are sick of the I saw the movie, but the book must be better &#34;because&#34; it's a book crowd! I've been that way Forever, and my Fiance' and my Friends all agree....Just because some movies HAVE books as well DOES NOT make them better. I'm just as over it as other people...and it makes me think of movie Remakes from Hollywood's big Plans, some can be wicked awesome......and some can be wicked stupid.......get over it Hollywood.....Remaking movies doesn't make them any better either. In fact-WHAT you Need to do is go out there....get some new ideas.....quit trying to make EVERYTHING with CGI effects, (then we wouldn't have to worry about budgets if you made movies like you did in the 80's. Quit trying to censor EVERYTHING, cause THAT ALONE gets on my nerves! I DON'T WANT OR NEED my movies to be in a nice neat bubble wrapped package, I was raised on Scary Movies and I like blood and guts, and gore and great storylining; this film has that ( I mean check out the scene at the beginning in the classroom; but the book theory I give a major thumbs down!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book ties the ends up and leaves you with an emptiness at the same time. I would recommend this series to anyone.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|All nations banding together to use giant robots to fight monsters!  What's not to like?  Subtext: they also embarrass bureaucracies who try to take the human-hero element out of warfare (Squirrel voice-over: &#34;That trick never works!&#34;).<br />Later the same night I read (translation of H. Himaruya, I think): &#34;Typical American action movie: they're fighting the Russians, then the aliens invade, so the Americans and Russians team up to fight the aliens.&#34;  And I thought: wow, I actually just saw that one. . .
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book was too long and slow for me. The last fifty pages were really good and fast paced. Thanks
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Blah. I bought this when it came out and was very excited. But then I got let down. Not my favorite and haven't listened to it since I bought it.
0897502027|5.0|This book is a MUST READ for any aspiring martial artist, regardless of discipline.  After 30+ years this book is still relevant.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|large numbers...easy to use!  since I always have my Kindle with me at all times, it is easily accessible. great idea!

But when she discovers her mother was killed by an assassin’s bullet and not in a boating accident, Camile fears past violence and present danger may be related to her father’s involvement in the production of armaments.<br /><br />With a new identity as Micah, Camile reconnects with the handsome stranger.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome. I<br />made a mansion out of wool then burned it. there are tons of stuff you can make
B000ASATZ8|5.0|This is the way I like my horror movies!  There are thrills, but there is also a very healthy dose of humor in all four movies!  My only regret is that not all of them are dubbed in Spanish.  I love watching them in Spanish to help me practice!
B00C5R71U8|5.0|All about Jony Ive it's a great read about how he got where he is and how he does what he does!<br /><br />My highest recommendation!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book tore me to pieces in the most beautiful way. A story intelligently and compassionately told, each word felt like it was selected carefully and deliberately, cradled gently, and placed on the page. Simple and pure, this story is an unexpected perspective on the lives of many, mainly our protagonist Liesel, in Nazi Germany during the buildup and height of WWII.<br /><br />The book is technically young adult fiction, but I am no longer of that demographic and do believe that readers of any age will find it enjoyable.<br /><br />Bottom line, read it. You won't regret it!
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Love this show with this cast.  The writing is usually really good and the characters make it work for me better than any other incarnation of this show.  Thoughtful and well done production.
B00000JPH6|5.0|If you haven't seen this classic movie then you are missing out!  True, it has some scary parts, especially for kids, but in general it is a very nice fantasy with some of the most amazing puppeteering I've ever seen!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is very convenient in connecting my devices as well as my computer. I like most of the features, but what is stopping me from giving this app a 5-star rating is the consistent persisting to use my location or contacts when I have time and again refused. There should be an easy to turn off those kind of suggestions.
B0031RS2HC|1.0|If Hell has a library, it will only contain ten thousand copies of the Killing Floor.<br /><br />It is written in a style quite accessible to, if not strictly aimed at people who struggle with reading and comprehension.  Stunted sentences. Brief, colorless descriptions.  Lackluster  pace, and no suspense curve. Lifeless dialogue. A car being nosed out of a parking lot.  Mind-numbing repetition. A gory murder scene. Policemen investigating a gory crime scene. An old Bentley nosing into a driveway. People sitting down. A door making a sucking sound. A car nosing into a parking lot. People standing around. Two Hispanics in a car, nosing down the road.<br /><br />This book has completely put me off crime fiction. I thought Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander was a dull protagonist, until Lee Child nosed the blowhard Jack Reacher into my consciousness.<br /><br />He has stolen hours of my life, that I will never get back.<br /><br />DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good game. Just wish you didn't have to buy access or ask friends to unlock episodes. Some levels are really challenging.
B00407PNY2|5.0|I had never seen this movie before and was not sure if I would enjoy it.  But I do!  This is a great action movie with a great plot and great acting!
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|Def Leppard is sounding great! The video and sound quality is outstanding. Relive the 80s with this DVD and you won't regret it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and addictive game. I am soo happy they made it available on the kindle fire. I have it downloaded on both my daughter's and mine. Love it.
B001AFF25W|5.0|Enjoyed the book and got some great ideas I can put into use today.  I recommend it for anyone struggling with getting it all done.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Ironically I enjoy this movie more than my kids do.  This is a very funny movie with a sweet story and a hilarious bad guy!  My kids don't like it so much because it portrays parents and school principals as uncaring, but I still like it!  :o)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved season 1 and 2 of Walking Dead!! Nothing bad to say about this season at all. Good action. Lots of zombie gore. And the human drama was not overly cheesy.<br /><br />Now season 3 on the other hand, was a huge let down. I was really excited to get that same feel from season 3 as 1 & 2, but the human drama seemed to take the forefront in this one--and not in a good way. The zombies seemed to be more of a setting than part of the story at this point. And then, just when I am revved up for a final showdown between the humans and all of their drama--bwa...wa...waaaa. There was no showdown, and the series just ended on a really flat note. Looking forward to season 4 for some redemption.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Ive this game my friend told me about it and at first I didn't like it but I rule over anyone else's review
B003TSEL7S|2.0|These books are kind of boring now. Rick Riordan doesn't do anything new or original with his story. Sure he made them lose their memory, but they always win. There are seldom any plot twists that make this book or his books exciting. Also the characters are very two dimensional. Oh well. I really liked his first Percy Jackson series, but I didn't care for the Egyptian series very much. This new \\"Heroes of Olympus\\" is just okay. This book is tense at times but in the end its just boring.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This Star Trek spoof is hilarious!!  And its not one of those cheesy spoofs where they are just trying too hard (like SpaceBalls), but they actually have a decent plot to go along with the humor!  And the special effects aren't half bad either, especially considering when this movie was made!  I love this movie and recommend it for everyone who loves Space adventure stuff and humor!
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|So far so good. Just started the series and we are only about 3 episodes in. I am already intrigued again though—even after the huge let down of a finale in season 3.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My seven,five,and three year old granddaughters love the movie and so do we. Performers are talented,music is great,no scary parts and added features are fun.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|The story is a good story. I like how Rebecca Stead weaves together different stories. By the end of the book I really like the characters and I was satisfied how it ended.
B0087ZG7J8|4.0|I love Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park II, and this movie isn't half bad either.  It seems to have a few more plot holes that the previous two, which is why I only gave it four stars.  But don't get me wrong I still really enjoy this movie quite a bit!
0345803507|3.0|I read only a little to see what the hype was all about—I saw nothing different than any other trashy romance novel on the market. The wife loved it though, and although I would never kiss and tell when it comes to my wife, I can say that I directly benefited from her readings.
1451627289|4.0|Enjoyed most of the book,despite the fact that it was extremely long. King could have skipped much of the redundant detail throughout the story and fleshed out the ending better. The ending was abrupt and predictable. Despite those weaknesses it is a great beach or vacation book and is far superior to most of King's other novels.
B008I43DYU|5.0|As a student I tried a few calculators and I liked this one the best.  Easy to use and does everything I needed it to.
B00015YVD6|3.0|I'll admit I had higher hopes when I purchased this movie, not having seen it before.  Maybe I've been tainted by seeing so many newer movies repeat what happens in this movie, but it seems pretty clich&eacute;.  Mermaid falls in love with human, she becomes human temporarily in order to get him to fall in love with her, and she's topless throughout a good portion of the movie (i.e. when she's a mermaid.)  And that's actually why I decided, grudgingly, to chuck this movie, because in this one you can actually see the mermaid's niples at some points, albeit only briefly.  Too bad.
B0000039QA|5.0|I have listened to Biggie's first album, &#34;Ready to Die,&#34; countless times in the 90's when it was released, at the time it was groundbreaking for East Coast and rap in general, and he had a great easy flow. Any true Biggie fan should know by now that &#34;Life After Death&#34; is a way better album with wayyyy more complex and brilliant lyrics and storytelling. Ready To Die had shorter, simpler rhymes, some even bordering on silly and definitely primitive compared to Life After Death. Biggie definately matured a lot in the 4 years time from his first to second album.<br /><br />While I will not review each track, I will say that the theme of death and stories about shootouts/drug deals/setups come across way heavier/scarier than on his previous album. (You actually feel like you are there, and see the characters he describes) There are just way more layers to his rhymes than in his previous album. There is a reason Ready To Die sold 4 million and Life After Death topped 10 million; he always had flow, but for this double-album, he simply graduated into a better rapper.<br /><br />I admit I didn't really feel about half the tracks on this album, (admittedly this is a double CD) however the other half were as good as any tracks heard in gangster rap ever.<br /><br />The only hip-hop album I would say that is better than Life After Death all-time (and I have heard hundreds of albums) would be Nas' Illmatic. That is not to say Nas is or isn't a better rapper overall.<br /><br />Nas Jay-Z and Biggie to me have the best flow all-time, (Tupac, who was a great rapper, didn't rely on flow and was more of a poet than rapper.)
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Very stable and challenging game.  I LOVE the music.<br />I have yet to beat it, but there are definitely unique challenges with this game.<br />I would give it 4.5 stars, but 4 is solid for this title.  Pick it up if you want some fun :)
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this all the time with so many programs that request it anymore.  Adobe thank you for helping us.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|I love this movie!  I can't wait for the next one to come out in 2015!  One of my favorite things to do is have a JP movie playing in Spanish.  That way I can even claim that it's study!  :oD
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I JUST FLAT out LOVE MINECRAFT!!! The only best way to love minecraft is the world.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Good app with a very bright light. The version I downloaded had apps which aren't too bad, but at night when you are trying to use it as a light, I've clicked on the app and it sent me to a link.  Somewhat annoying when I'm trying to find things at night and then have to pay attention to apps.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great little game that is easy to play while you are waiting.  The fun display at the end when you have a winning game is a joy.
B002436WFI|5.0|I love Terry Pratchett's Discworld books!  However, I should point out that if you were looking for a movie that exactly mirrors the plot of the book &#34;The Color of Magic&#34; then you will be a little disappointed.  Although that is part of the plot, there are also plots from several other of the Discworld books present as well.  In any case though, this movie is chock full of the Pratchett humor that I have come to love!  I highly recommend it as a funny, fantasy movie!  My only regret is that it doesn't have a Spanish language track.  : (  I really enjoy watching movies in Spanish so that I can improve my Spanish.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Very good quality, has a good camera and love the videos! Easy to use and very fun to mess around with, I would recommend it to anyone!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My son and his roommate had cords all over just to connect Macbooks for streaming, but the Chromecast works perfectly for them without the corded mess. Awesome clarity and transmission without any lag from both Windows or Apple laptops. My sons phone is Android, and we sat on the couch throwing things up on the TV without any lag. The Chromecast switched between content from three mobile devices like a boss. Super easy and fast set-up.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I REALLY WANT TO TEXT MY FRIENDS. THE LOGIN SAYS TAKING LONGER THAN USUAL TRY AGAIN LATER!!! SO I TRY AGAIN LATER AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENS. TRY AGAIN LATER!!!!! FIX PLEASE
B004GJYROG|5.0|Let me preface this review by stating that I'm not a sports person.  Even though I'm American I have never seen a complete basketball, baseball, or football game...ever.  But I still love this movie!  Michael Jordan is a surprisingly good actor, as are the Looney Toons!  And this movie is chock full of the wonderful, spontaneous, slapstick humor we've all come to expect from the Looney Toons!
B006M4F67A|4.0|Love it!!! Looking for a game like this. I play this all of the time. I hate writing a set amount of words!!! Keeps locking up on the Kindles.
0060578793|5.0|I gave this to my grandson last Christmas....he loved it....he is 12 years old and I think boys around 12-16 would love this book
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|It is not hard at all.I don't think that the game makes more trees for gems or quicksilver. So overall I rate this as 4 stars
0679805273|5.0|This is by far one of the most famous of all Dr. Seuss books!  And for good reason!  I got this book for my 5-year-old daughter.  Yes I know that this book is generally purchased for high school/college graduates, but I still love reading this book to her.  And she really loves to have me read it to her!  We've had this book for several months now, and she still brings me this book about half the time we sit down to read.
B003INBNXO|5.0|one of the best fight movies!... full action all the time I highly recommended it!, you will have action from the beginning to the end
0380730405|5.0|Bout this for my 13 yr old granddaughter, she loves to read and since this was one of my all time favorite books, I hope she will enjoy it too
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chrome cast is almost perfect, turning my big dumb TV into a Netflix showcase.  I just wish more apps supported it.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I love watching this movie with my kids.  Okay, maybe I'm a bit of a kid myself, but still.  This movie is chock full of laughs and full on fun!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Wonderful item overall, however im a heavy user & tend to find the battery life insufficent. (6 hrs usage in 1 go). Sound quality is pretty good.
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|I love this album. Porter embodies the best of Gil Scott Heron, A jazzy version of Otis Redding and so many of the fore fathers of R&B soul. While he does not have a great vocal range he does excellent with what he has. He makes you listen to him and you really want to. Not a bad song on this album.
B006S08RLU|2.0|Did not find it easy to follow. The subtitles are very incomplete. Some sentences are partial. Very frustrating, and I understand a bit of French. If you don't, don't bother. You won't get half the dialogue or narration just from the subtitles. Very poorly done.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|As with most albums there are a few songs on here that I don't like a whole lot, but even those songs are good, and there are only two or three of them.  One thing that pleasantly surprised me was that I found some more of their songs that I really enjoyed that I hadn't heard before.  I highly recommend this album!
B00E6895M6|5.0|Chvrches has made a great album, and there isn't a bad song on this debut. Get it! You won't be disappointed!
B00AM0C6YG|3.0|I may need to listen to this more but so far meh. She may be one of those people who is better live than in the studio.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Draws you into a world based on English history laced with mythical and fantastical creatures.  Intrigue ,love, betrayal and politics.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Even though this is a classic, I had never seen it before.  But I figured I would take a chance since it is a Spielberg.  Well, I wasn't disappointed!  Now keep in mind that I scare very easily even though I'm a 32-year-old man.  But basically the family in this film is being haunted by a poltergeist who kidnaps their daughter.  I love the unpredictable events that unfold throughout the movie, and the fact that it isn't too scary.  :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter's favorite game. She plays all the time getting much enjoyment out of it. She recommends it to all &quot;My Little Pony&quot; fans.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|College Hoover is just absolutely amazing! I will always get any book she writes ! Hopeless is such a good story . It made me happy sad crying laughing it was perfect !!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|i have a kindle fire and i needed space because i had games on it and i needed an update to play one of them which was my favorite Tapped Out i got this app and it works well love it<br />p.s.if you play tapped out my username is joecarney684 i think or somthing with those numbers
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This was a laugh out loud story which I had trouble putting down. Whilst enjoying the intended humour, I could also empathise with the main character, Don, as he struggled to learn how to deal with social situations whilst having Asperger's Syndrome. A well written book from Graeme Simsion.
B00FHATBGW|3.0|I am stuck.  I know I'm supposed to fill the cup with water but I can't, no matter where I try to place it.  I even restarted the game from the beginning.  This is a shame, because I was really enjoying the game.  Everything else about it was great (there were some tap sensitivity issues).  Boo.  Could easily have been a five star.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|I bought this in conjunction with another movie for my uncle for Christmas. I know he will enjoy both of them.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|It's a classic, with Blu-Ray, it's like being there. Blah, blah. BS BS BS and more BS . You have a lot of nerve telling me how long a review I should write.  K.I.S.S. Keep It Simple Stupid.  How's your P.C.  now.  Will not renew my Amazon Prime.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Love this movie! I love big robots and large monsters duking it out on the open sea. What else is better than that.
B00466HM28|4.0|i like this unit a lot.. I use at  DJ shows.. HOWEVER  the usb jack comes apart easy... I sugguest once you plug the  usb cable it to leave it plugged in glue or tape it to the unit unplugging it and plugging it in will cause the jack to come apart.. its the only faulty this with the usb controllers from AKAI so kep that in mind some places will charge about 65 buck for &#34;parts and labor&#34;  so if you on a budget keep the usb plug  plugged into the unit when your not using it..
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|A wonderul story that criscrosses time at all times, and where all characters are tightly intertwined. At 64 I find it amazing that this was written by someone at 27!!!  Chapeau! a million times over...<br />The setting is 19th century New Zealand during the gold rush.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast works as advertised, very easy to set-up and use. It works flawless with my Nexus 7 and Nexus 5. I have not had any issue streaming Netflix, Hulu and youtube.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this app with it's changeable cards, background and action. I gave it only 4 Stars because of the constant advertisements.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It worked before and when I got my replacement it didn't work! I see other people are having the same problems too. This needs to be fixed! Why is it &quot;Currently Unavailable&quot;?? Makes me mad! It's super annoying!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Took me a while to get into the book, too much jumping around in time, but about halfway through I got used to that and it was really, really good.
1435122968|5.0|Beautiful book that should be in anyone's horror collection.  Silver leaf and holographic cover.  Could not give this a poor review to any degree, it covers his entire work from when he was a child to when he was an adult and has a well written prelude for every story talking about what he was doing at that point in his life and what the story might relate to,
B0076DELIG|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"black box\\" Connelly is right back on top with this one! write another and keep them coming please.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but the controls are a little buggy. I love the computer version  I hope that it updates because it's kinda buggy.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|Big Fan of comic book movies. I love bluray The hero played by nicolas Cage great creepy skull man. Plus cool ride.
B00G32TD98|5.0|If your'e in the mood not to sleep well and to be uncomfortable, this is the movie for you.  Perfect old school horror that will make you hate / love watching it.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I wanted to read this book when I overheard someone talking about it. Will want you to keep reading more. Was a little disappointed with the end, although I don't really know what I was even expecting. So it definitely gets  an outstanding in my book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was such a good game. Just WOW!!!!! It was worth the money I hope you enjoy the game. Enjoy
B004DTLK62|5.0|I like the movie. Great Drama. The Anniversary is still great and tells a great story based on the real Chaplin, but greatly don.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This was such a fun, worthy purchase. I read all the other reviewers before I decided to buy it. I am very happy with my purchase, it is well worth the price paid and the easy install,and usage. I do not know what anyone was looking for, my entertainment needs have been met with Chromecast so much, I am buying another for my bedroom. It is portable, if you want to move it from tv to tv. As I said, I am happy with the purchase, I would definitely recommend this.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|A great series that you should definitely watch if you're a Halo fan. As far as the blu-ray goes, I got it in very safe packaging, all sealed up and absolutely no issues whatsoever with the disc. Very pleased.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|As much as i loved divergent and insurgent, and believe me i loved them a lot, i was disappointed with this book. with out giving away spoilers, i will just say that then ending makes less and less sense the more you think about it. the end game, what they fought for, has so many plotholes and questions that were not even discussed none the less answered. the bouncing between POVs was a good idea, poorly executed. in the short stories tobias has a very distinct voice and way of thinking and being. in the book i was missing that a lot. i had to stop and remind myself i was in his POV a lot because he sounded so much like tris. in the shorts you never, for one nano second, think you are in tris' head. that was confusing for me. i get what she was trying to do, and i commend her for that, really i do, but to me, it just didnt seem to work. that being said if you've read the other two books theres really no point to not read this one. there are some fantastic moments in it and the overall themes and messages presents are clear and well written. which is also why the ending is so disappointing. not because of what happens, but how it happens.
B0021L9ME6|5.0|I love Halle Berry. She did other movies like x-men as storm, but I rank her #2 of my favorite cat woman
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham is always a great author to read.<br />This book is no different .<br />From the opening to the end you don't want to put the book down.<br />I always find myself carrying the book with me to read a few minutes whenever I can .<br />I would recommend this book to anyone .
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Very pleased with this purchase. Almost mint condition, could barely tell it was used other then the fact that it had been previously opened.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Outlander is one of my favorite movies.<br />Unlike other films, I can actually watch it beginning to end multiple times.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson Demille is a great writer and I just Love his books.  When I am able to read one of his Novels, it's hard to put down.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|as an atty. I  appreciated  Grisham's  characterizations of the trial judge & the attys described in the book; very real to life
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|David and Goliath feels like an continuation of Malcolm Gladwell's other book Outliers. I am a big fan of Gladwell; he has a clear and concise writing style. His most recent publication does not disappoint. I think the information provides a platform for human innovation, psychology and business application. I have read all of his books and I think this one is probably my favorite.
0061969656|5.0|One of the best historical fiction writers out there. He gives you a very good overview of early britain to include the vikings.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Outstanding story and the details of the story are awesome. I found this book (as all TC's books) hard to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is a really awesome game i like the diferent  places you can play at the powerups are really afective
0694003611|5.0|My favorite childhood bedtime story. I remember it like yesterday and this will be a classic forever! This is definitely a staple in your child's life!
B005EIS5IW|4.0|I have two felines who read this book over my shoulder.  They helped give it 4 stars.  It would have gotten 5 stars, but the cats said none of the drawings looked like them so they were holding out on an excellent rating.  This really is a cute and enjoyable read for anyone living with a cat.  I saw myself more than once in this cute set of cartoons.
0143119680|3.0|The Discovery of Witches is about a witch who denies her witchly heritage and becomes a history professor at Yale. After receiving tenure, she spends a year studying at the Bodleian library. While there, she discovers a long-lost magical text, realizes that she is the most powerful witch of her generation, and teams up with a 1500 year old vampire to bring the text to light. It is a wonderful read, but it is important to remember that it is just fantasy. Nothing like this could ever happen in the real world.<br /><br />I mean, really, NOBODY gets tenure in history at Yale.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|This has unique characters using ingested metals for strength. A war is raging between two fractions, one oppressed and one of nobility both controlled by one who claims to ruler over all. Vin has powers she hasn't discovered but will soon learn. Along with the metals she must learn to trust.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love this game much easier than dragon story. Also made for android .you should give it a try sometime u won't be disappointed.
B00368PSN2|5.0|This movie is great. I love the viking/alien tale. It must of been released straight to DVD because I did not see or even hear about it. I am a big fan of Jim Caviezel and he didn't disappoint. I like Ron Pearlman and John Hurd too. The story keeps your interest and knowing it is Sci-Fi I hope others take it for what it is Entertainment. I really dislike when people write reviews and diss a film because it isn't realistic or far fetched. This is an entertaining movie.
140006922X|3.0|Hi-profile books like Zealot are hard to review because they have been criticized, and defended, for all the wrong reasons. In this case, both critics and defenders have focused on the completely irrelevant issue of it's author's religion. Reza Aslan was born in an Iranian Muslim family, converted to Evangelical Christianity in his youth, and reconverted to Islam as an adult. This is perhaps the least important fact about the book or its author that I can imagine, as Zealot does not present itself to us as a spiritual meditation. Aslan aims to make some historical observations about the historical Jesus in the context of the historical Roman Palestine during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius. One need not be a Christian to do such a thing, any more than one must be French to write a biography of Napoleon.<br /><br />It does not follow, however, that Zealot is a good book. As much as I wanted to like it because I dislike its critics and loved the author's Fox News interview, I found it, at best, a mediocre effort.<br /><br />In the first place, it is a very thin book--about two hundred pages not counting the bibliographical essays at the end. This is not inherently problematic. Indeed, given the actual amount of primary material that he was working with, two hundred pages could be considered quite a stretch. But, really, he is trying to construct a context for Jesus's life, and this context comes off as rather thin. He is essentially redacting much longer biographies of Jesus in his time (such as John Meier's massive, four-volume book A Marginal Jew without adding much of his own. As he acknowledges in the beginning of the book, there has been so much written about Jesus that every single factual assertion about his life can be matched with an equally well-documented and plausible assertion that contradicts it. The most that a popular biographer like Aslan can do is select his facts from a well-read menu.<br /><br />Fair enough. Most people aren't going to read Father Meier's magnum opus. But I find the facts that Alsan selects to be somewhat problematic. Specifically, he relies on the gospel narratives (especially Matthew and Luke) for nearly every assertion that he makes, while, at the same time, dismissing large portions of those narratives as historically inaccurate. He rejects, for example, the Virgin Birth, the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist, the story of Jesus in the Temple, Christ's trial before Pilate, and Christ's trial before Caiaphas. But he absolutely insists--primarily on the strength of the Gospels--that Christ was crucified, that he chose twelve and only twelve apostles, that he cast out demons, that he healed lepers, that he cleansed the temple during Passover, that he rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, and that he claimed for himself the title &#34;Son of Man&#34;--all aspects of the New Testament story that are essential to his argument.<br /><br />Since he does not source individual claims (choosing instead to write a bibliographic essay for each chapter that is included in the notes section), it is hard to evaluate his claims. But it certainly appears that he is very selectively choosing how much of the Kool Aid to drink. He accepts some parts of the story uncritically while rejecting others out of hand. And-quite ironically for those criticizing his religion--he almost always chooses to accept the Christian version of these events over the Muslim version--even when the latter version is written explicitly into the Q'uran.<br /><br />The most important example of this phenomenon is the crucifixion. At the start of the book, he claims that the crucifixion is one of only two concrete facts about Jesus that everybody accepts (the other being that he was Jewish) (xxvii). This is in fact not true, as most of the other one billion muslims in the world reject it--and a not-inconsequential number of scholars of religion dispute even the existence of a historical Jesus of Nazareth. But Aslan hangs an enormous part of his argument on the fact of Jesus's crucifixion, which, he argues, proves that Jesus was considered by Romans to be a dangerous traitor and a threat to their authority.<br /><br />And this is the core of Aslan's argument: that Jesus was a radicalized, anti-Roman Jew of the kind that would come to be called Zealots. He believed (probably correctly) that the Temple priests were Roman lackeys, and he opposed both them and their Roman masters, encouraging his followers to do the same. During his lifetime, his disciples considered him the Messiah, by which they specifically meant a political deliverer, and, soon after he died, these same followers had to reconstruct their notion of Messiaship. The manner of his death--crucifixion--proves conclusively that he was a threat to the Roman Empire, but, after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Christians rewrote their history to eliminate references to anti-Roman activity in their central figure.<br /><br />This might be true. It is certainly possible. But Zealot really does no more than articulate the contours of the argument. It does not come anywhere near proving it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Until they start getting more than Netflix and youtube, I'm not gonna give this a good rating.  I don't have my computer in the room I use this so I can't use the Chrome add on.  I only have an iPhone so I am a bit disappointed.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn keeps the legend of Mitch Rapp going with this fascinating story of intrigue and covert operations.  If you like spy/counterspy stories, this one's for you.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|It was everything you could want in a Superhero movie, but it suffered at various points from being incredibly convenient. There can be no doubt that the plot took a bit of a back seat to showing off the characters. Still, the movie was a visual powerhouse.
1451666179|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Allie's blog and the book did not disappoint. It's clever, well written, and hilarious.<br />Allie has a way of capturing truly awkward moments and elaborating them through illustrations and written language makes for a great read. While the stories range from stories I like to ones I couldn't wait to share with everyone I've ever met, her treaties on depression is truly inspirational. Anyone suffering from, or has a history of, depression must read this.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game is by no means &quot;FREE&quot;. If you become addicted to it, you will spend real $$$$$$. You can NEVER get ahead. ALWAYS  read any comments about a game from the lowest to the highest. You will invariably get the true story. Also play the game for a while and save comments for later, you will get a better take on how the system within the bingo game really works. You may only comment once, that is how most of these &quot;free&quot; games get their 5 stars, by offering a reward in the beginning to get a quick rating. Get the reward, but save the actual comment for later assessment. There are a lot of Senior Citizens who play these bingo games, whom are on fixed incomes. My goal is to educate folk about what I believe to be scams, especially Senior Citizens.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love it the beginning is great but theirs like a lot of things that you can buy (with real money)it's a great game though! I just ignore the other stuff(a little hard) but still.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is great for little kids think about how hard it is to take care of a horse. This would be great for people learn what it is like to take care of a horse.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is pretty good overall. The only thing I don't like about it is that 1. It takes a lot of time to load. 2. There is a lot of blood when you shoot an animal and it splatters everywhere.
0446530573|3.0|I guess if you really like original Italian cuisine, it might be okay. It's written from the perspective of the Soprano family and friends, but I did not find it particularly interesting. Even though I had just watched the entire series. It's a gag gift at most.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoy the search. So far so fun. I'm enjoying the game. If you have patience this game won't cost you anything.
