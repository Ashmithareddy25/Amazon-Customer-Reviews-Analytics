020530902X|5.0|I needed this little book and as you can tell, I have not finished reading it. The basic grammar rules are invaluable to someone who writes regularly regularly to the public. So thankful for a short easy to understand book about writing.
030758836X|1.0|I couldn't stomach the language.  After 25 pages of more F words than I could count, I put it down.  It's too bad, it seemed interesting.  Really?  You need that much language to convey your point and I doubt that individuals that are as successful as the two individuals in this book use such language.  Trashy!  It's almost as though the author was trying to see just how many swear words she could fit in.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game but I am always getting booted out of rooms. They do give you your lost credits back but you still lose any power ups that you used and all experience points you earn..please work on this!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|We  rented this on a sunday afternoon and enjoyed it very much.  Tom Hanks is always great!  Filled the afternoon nicely.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|This is a very good movie. It was good enough that I bought it which I usually do not do. Great Rocky type story which makes yopu feel good. I always like rooting for the underdog..
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A lovely, bitter-sweet, magical story with vivid enchanting imagery and mystical characters. I am in England as I read this and have spent a good amount of time in Cheshire farm country and in Hadrian' s Wall farm country. The smells and sights he describes come to life and transport me back to those places, and the beautiful magic they contain. Gaiman' s imagination and surrealism has always been unparalleled, and still is in this story. I recommend it.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|My kids have really enjoyed this movie.  It is one that they always want to watch and they haven't gotten bored with it.  It is one that gets watched more often than others.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game, it is fast and funny, I just wish<br />I was better at it, practice, and more practice
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so  addictive. Like having a really horse. Really impressed with the animation too such a great game.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Silly and predictable but ultimately very watchable. kid friendly as well. CGI okay has a pretty good soundtrack.worth watching with the family.
B003G4W49C|5.0|After reading the Rho Project trilogy I thought I'd have a hard time finding a science fiction novel that would compare to it. Boy was I wrong. This book had me burning through pages and loving every one of them. The twist near the end was a like a punch to my brain that left me humbled because I didn't see it coming in the least. 10/5. This is a must-read.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Way too much unneeded cursing poor acting very little humor. Went into this movie with low expectations and they were not meet
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is the most fantastical book ever and I really can't believe that there won't be a sequel.<br />U really need to get this book.
B0070XFNDE|3.0|This chapter had a different feel that the other stories in the series but that being said it was still a beautiful read.
B00062PN6I|4.0|These are budget headphones. Fortunately that's why I bought them. The last set of these I bought was a replacement set for my 11yr old son to use while playing games. I wanted decent inexpensive headphones for my kid because I know at some point he's going to accidentally get the cord caught in the desk & kill them. When that happens, I will buy another pair of these because they work well & don't cost too much.<br /><br />They do sound good and fit good. They are very light so they are not uncomfortable. They are a little loose fitting, but that's to be expected. I use them myself on occasion, but I would not use them as my main set. I personally prefer higher end sets, but those can break just as easily as cheaper sets. So I give my kid the cheaper ones, just in case.<br /><br />I also keep a couple pairs of these in my home studio for guests. They aren't high end of course, but they do work, and they do sound decent. And again, if they get broken bc a guest kills them, I'm not out anything.<br /><br />They work, they sound pretty good for the price, and I will buy them again & recommend them to people who need good inexpensive headphones. Be an informed shopper people. Don't expect something you pay $10 for to sound as good as or last as long as something you pay $100 for.<br /><br />These are great for the price. Know what you are buying and be happy ;p
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|switch 3 a lot of fun especially when your board.<br />the older kids will like it my 10 year old especially.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game has fantastic puzzles which force you to think out of the box. Some puzzles appear to be unsolvable so you use coins to obtain the solution only to find that it really was simple.  I give the developer credit in the design and simplicity of execution.  Will keep you involved for hours.
B0090SI460|5.0|This set is the complete prequel to Monsters University.  I so love Pixars stuff as for Disney is just amazing.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good hidden object game, only niggle is once past the early levels you soon run out of energy and have to recharge. Well worth getting though if you like this genre of game
B009UNGYHG|4.0|It's nice to have a case to protect the headset when it is not in use, but it is especially helpful that it uses a standard micro USB port. This allows me to ditch the proprietary magnetic charger that came with the headset and use the micro USB cord that works with my other devices.<br /><br />Although battery life hasn't been a problem with the headset, there have been a couple of times when the battery did get low. Charging the headset with this charging case made it quick and painless - no searching for an outlet and ready to go in less than an hour.<br /><br />The only negative I've found is that the see through plastic lid tends to smudge. The lid also feels a bit flimsy.<br /><br />Otherwise, a great product and one I would buy again.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Just do yourself a favor and download this amazing short story mostly<br />About imagination and the most underrated genius of our times...
0399226907|5.0|Great book by a great author. Kids everywhere love this story and appreciate it's simplicity and bright colors. Only negative is probably me picking nits, but butterflies form a chrysalis - not a cocoon. Great story, though.
1616550414|4.0|It's definitely a good addition to the items i plan to collect of zelda and hyrule, the book arrived in great condition and i know it will be a good flashback of reading :)
B00000612G|5.0|This is a master piece for sure.  This is an album that can be listened too over and over and you never get tired of it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I LOVE it!  Great action - funny... I would recommend it to anyone.  I can watch it over and over.
B008SVFX96|4.0|I have all 3 of Richie's albums and Undiscovered Soul is absolutely the best.  I wish he would create an album with more ballets on it.  He is a terrific song writer.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is amazing but I could really do without all the nudity.  Very good acting and you wont belive the plot turns!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Found the game very good but there seems to be a glitch on the child's bedroom search as the last item is behind the back button
1401923127|5.0|love Bruce Lipton's writing, superb ideas, great research, everyone should read this book. It arrived in excellent condition, fast shipment, devoured it right away. Many thanks
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like to use this as a back-up to my regular alarm clock.  It works pretty well for what I need it to do.

B000NY12LO|4.0|Wow! What a twist at the end! The detailed description of the school following the shooting was very realistic. I recommend this book.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This is WAY better! It's even better than Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. And there are no sparkling vampires or brooding tweens in this film either. Please note: There is no product placement or hip hop tunes either. I love this movie.
B00125JP1C|5.0|An over the top adventure story with action per minute and stunt per minute flavor. Just a fun no thinking action drama.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|entertaining keeps you looking for more!!! I love puzzles and this is a good one if you enjoy discovering clues snd connecting them this is for you!
B00BDZV9M4|4.0|Overall a good album. I find myself getting a little annoyed with his raps sometimes. He isn't the same lil wayne I once knew but im still a fan. This album is full of good beats and good lyrics...tons of metaphors. My favorite tracks are Trigger Finger, Trippy, Gunwalk, and God Bless Amerika. I would say its an album worth buying, no classic though.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|We actually argue who gets the electronics with this on it.  I finally put it on my Kindle fire which I got from amazon for a great deal.  But Now my little one can watch this anytime her heart desires,
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Young talkative children will enjoy the recording part. Boys will enjoy the explosive chemicals. Very easy to operate.<br />Once you show them how, let them play.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This book was truly amazing. It is a kids book but reading this at my age realizing that it has a whole other meaning. The book has a deep meaning that is different. Everyone should read this book.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As a middle school student I myself understand how a kid feels when  he is having a bad  day in front of so many peers,but how auggie handled his problems made the book what it was. Auggies personality affected so many people in the book that anyone who read the book is that much smarter,kinder, and overall a wonder to the world
B000002I77|4.0|..but a different approach seems to have been taken with the digital remastering of this one. I like them both. Just seem to prefer the record. Mind you, I have a decent setup for playback and a superb MC phono preamp. Artistically? This is the best work Billy C. ever did, IMHO. Feel free to correct me on this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season Three is undoubtably the most outstanding season as per action, locations and music. The Hghland music is haunting and should be developed.<br /><br />Although saddened to see the departure of my favorite character, I am hopeful another charming, good looking, and intelligent person will take his place.
B004OKFISQ|5.0|Very fine pressing of a most well-put-together album. This is the way it was done - when it was done right. Stands the test of time and I'm not even a fan of pop/rock/folk. This album spans all those genres. Gracefully. I'm happy.
0345529057|2.0|The books are great, no doubt about it. This review is for the 4-book set itself, and I would caution potential buyers that the quality of this set is quite poor, hence the great bargain. However, I found it quite difficult to read and enjoy the story in this format, being light brown paper with fairly cheap print.<br /><br />If ease of reading can be an issue, my recommendation would be to go for the higher quality versions or better version in the library or an ebook version.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|My son love these guys...even if they are suppose to be monsters. This movie scores high in my book for both kid and parent entertainment.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|When I saw the promos for the release of this book, I was instantly intrigued.  First of all, the cover art is fantastic . . . the red shoe, the mechanical foot, and the title Cinder leave an impression of a steampunk adaptation of a fairy tale.  I love both steampunk and fairy tale adaptations, so putting this on my to be read shelf was a no-brainer.<br /><br />Further examination revealed the plot to be less steampunk and more Sci-Fi (an equal substitution in my book).  However, I was taken aback by the Young Adult (YA) labels.  Crap.  Ok, so this got pushed to the back of the TBR shelf.<br /><br />Once I finally got around to reading Cinder (listening to it on audio book), I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.  There were so many things that I typically don't like: plot predictability, a touch of YA angst, and a less than tidy conclusion.  And yet, I found it be a charming futuristic retelling of Cinderella.  The youthful voice of the audio book narrator lent itself well to the story.  I believe the quality of the narration enhanced the entertainment factor of the story.<br /><br />The fact that Cinderella was my favorite of the classic fairy tale when I was younger and way more girlie may have also contributed to my enjoyment.  (I think my Cinderella fixation may have been tied to my innate compulsive dancing disorder, you know, with the ball and all).  Regardless, I found myself so pulled into the story that I could not stop reading (er, listening).<br /><br />The primary plot played out very much like the classic tale, complete with wicked step mothers, a prince, and a ball.  However, there were also hints of Snow White thrown into the mix, with the legend of missing Lunar Princess who may or may not have escaped a deadly fate at the hands of the evil Lunar Queen.  Perhaps we will see a future tome devoted to the Snow White tale?<br /><br />Meyer also did a great job of blending in more depth and complexity to this fairy tale story.  For example, the author used cyborgs and androids to address themes of prejudice and oppression.  Meyer also dabbled with concepts of political intrigue, from the delicate balance of maintaining world peace, to the menace threat of the Lunar court, and the struggle of facing a deadly plague.<br /><br />Other than Cinder and Dr. Erland, most of the characters lacked depth.  I was ok with this, given the fairy tale nature of the story.  However, I would have liked a little more development for Prince Kai, whose character felt a bit like a leaf blowing in the wind.  Despite being one-dimensional, it was hard not fall in love with little Iko who I hope will be revived in future books.  But, the best character award has to go to Linh Mei (it IS her book after all).  Also known as Cinder, she was a wonderful character; hopeful, generous, and kind despite her battered and bruised body and spirit.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I did not mention my misgivings about the lack of Asian culture in the book I know that the story claims that the Eastern Commonwealth is a blend of many cultures, but given the obviously clearly Asian-inspired names and settings, it felt like a half-hearted attempt to differentiate the story from typical Western culture fairy tales.<br /><br />I can see where this would be a great book for young adult readers, but the darker themes lend appear for adult readers who are young of heart rather than young of age.  I hope the rest of the series has the same level of charm and appeal.e author used cyborgs and androids to address themes of prejudice and oppression.

B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My two year old son loves this movie! It warms my heart that he takes after his Daddy's love for cars...even if they are cartoon ones...that talk...and go on adventures to save the world...and well...you get the idea. I find myself watching too sometimes...enjoying the vibrant colors and fast paced action. There is only one thing that bugs me as a car guy...what is Lightning McQueen? A Corvette? A Dodge Viper? Argh! What are you...you little red sports car?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Lot of fun. The monster truck on the moon is the best to get lots of points for awesome flips. Great time waster.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Need I say more? I'm not one of these folks that look a gift horse in the mouth...if something is free and it has value...I'm not gonna knock them on the advertisements that pop up while choosing a weapon in the armory. &#34;Should I go with the shotgun or the chainsaw...what the??? Click here for free Maxi-pads...nope...close that window down and back to selecting a weapon.&#34; Anyway, its a fantastic game, addictive, good graphics and its provides more entertainment than a fat kid at an all you can eat chocolate fountain at a Golden Corral! A warning for guys...don't bring this to the thunderbox (toilet)...you'll regret the rings around your tail end!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game.  I have been playing for 9 months now and I haven't paid any money to play.  Can be a bit glitchy.  Have patience with game and you might enjoy it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book it wasn't just a boring history lesson it was more like a kick but action film I love greek mythology and the story of a underdog hero this is both looking forward to reading the other books in the series
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Book was new and in excellent condition.I have the Secret on my kindle but wanted a paper version to refer to.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I connected the Chromecast without too much trouble. It works Very well with my Samsung tablet 8&#34; but not with my IPad3,. Downloaded the app, to no avail. Maybe somebody can figure it out.  Great concept that I think will gain traction when more apps come. I wanted Amazon Prime Video and being able to watch my own videos using the iPad. I don't have Netflix, so the use is limited .  Until then, I will keep using Roku.
B009AY04A8|4.0|this game is really a lot of fun but it would be much better without the dialog.  it gives you the opportunity to skip the dialog but you have to do it with every page change. thats the only thing i didn't like. it would be better if you could just change it once for the whole game. i would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Sure, it's missing plenty of great PC parts, but It's still a good version. My younger brother loves it very much.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|It's a decent but not great animated feature.  It's not Toy Story good but it's not exactly Mulan horrible either.
B00BAVCD8A|1.0|Just look at the title.  One of the worst bands of all time has an album titled \\"save rock and roll\\".  Rock and roll doesn't need to be saved and fall out boy would be last on the list to save anything in regards to music. What a disgrace!!!!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The whole family watches Ponyo. These inspired-from-Japan kids movies are the best. So sweet and so intriguing, even to adults.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I knew this book was a classic before I read it, but that's pretty much the only information I had.  It typically takes me a few months to read anything as I usually put my time towards gaming when I have it, but this book stayed with me in the bathroom, before bed, at work, in the car, etc...  I finished it in a week and am SO hungry for more.
030758836X|4.0|I think every one of the (currently) 13,000+ reviews have probably already said what I'm here to say.<br /><br />I don't actually have words to describe what this book did to me. If you don't like dark, twisted, or characters you aren't sure if you like...don't read this.<br /><br />But if you know a thing or two about human nature and are in for a twist, well...jump in feet first. You won't regret it. GONE GIRL was an insane ride that (for me) started out slow only to flip into something I couldn't put down.  The only reason it has four stars and not five is because I had such a hard time liking the characters - which was the intent. Ms. Flynn knows human nature in all its ugliness, and man did she hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />Gone Girl.<br />Wow.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best show on TV. Can't wait for the new season. It is well written and superbly acted.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy being able to play Solitaire on my Kindle, however; I will get these stupid pops up for dating, etc. I do not like that.
B00BOVKYT6|5.0|A well written police procedural, thriller that has stood the test of time.  Arkady Renko is a charismatic character, patriotic, intelligent, intense, but also flawed and strangely vulnerable. He's a good police officer trying to investigate a horrific crime within the boundaries of a corrupt and rigid system.<br /><br />It's the setting, the glimpse of Russian life, politics and culture, along with Arkady Renko that make this atmospheric and quite intricate story so compelling. Well worth a look at.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Happy to have another of the series.blue ray a little tricky to play on my monitor,but it worked out ok
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it . I just run out of coins to fast lol.. I recommend others to join in on the fun
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is the cleanest recording I have heard in years.  The musicians are awesome.  They do not attempt to compete with each other. As I is tended, I could hear each individual instrument, but they were all blended beautifully.  The mixing job was excellent.  Vince Gill's singing is so good I just had to listen over and over.  The albumn is so good and so tasteful, I bought several extra copies for friends who appreciate truly great talent.  I can't find words to express how impressed I am by this album!!!! I
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Wonderful and easy to use app. Very user friendly and doesn't take up much room either. Works perfectly for what I need.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My daughter introduced me to the series one week as I was visiting her.  By the time I had to return to my home, I was hooked.  Watched the last 3 episodes of Season 3 in 1.5 days and have been feeling so sad for Mary.  Can't wait until the next season starts.  In fact, may have to watch all episodes again this Fall in preparation for the new series!  It is wonderful acting, costume and content.  Maggie Smith has the best lines of all the characters.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|A good shoot-'em-up.  The first time I have ever seen a hand to hand squabble where the participants run out of breath and physical poop.  That's the good part.  Reacher's holy attitude is as fake as the ending.

B002QRWJA4|2.0|The plot confused me when I saw Phantom in the theater, so I took one more look at it.  Minnie Driver is quite wonderful at being awful.  Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, and Gerard Butler, however, are just plain awful.  And the plot has holes as big as the one made by the falling chandelier.  I did like the black-and-white present/ color past switch, however.

B005DD7H50|1.0|== Spoilers ahead ==<br /><br />Limitless made for a fun, Friday-night romp, but ten minutes after leaving the movie theater, I realized its plot relied on idiotic coincidences and presented a disturbing, pro-drug message.  It's too bad, really, that the writing was so questionable, because the acting and cinematography were quite strong.<br /><br />Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a struggling, non-household-name writer who nevertheless has been paid an advance on a book he hasn't written yet.  (Okaaay, but we'll let that one go for the moment.)  Just when he's about to drain down the toilet of despair, an old friend introduces him to NZT, a drug that allows him to utilize his brain's full potential.  You know the old wive's tale, of course: we mortals are cursed to only use a small fraction of our brain cells because the rest of it is preoccupied with things like pornography.  But NZT, the wonder drug, allows Eddie to fire up his full 100 percent.  Suddenly, he can place his order with a waiter in a foreign language; and gee, we've never ever seen that in a movie before.  He finishes his novel in four days -- four days! -- as computer-generated letters and numbers rain down upon him and his word processor to show us the miracle of this manna-from-heaven intelligence.<br /><br />Soon, he makes a killing on the stock market and meets the financial world's godfather, played by Robert De Niro, whose name, Carl Van Loon, is surely coincidental to the character's being a loon.  Eddie's ex-girlfriend, Lindy (Abbie Cornish), falls in love with this new persona and rewards him with sex.<br /><br />Eddie also makes a killing in the form of a Courtney Love lookalike whom he murders during a drug-induced blackout.  So he uses his money to hire a high-rolling defense lawyer who -- coincidentally! -- works for Carl Van Loon's arch-nemesis, who employs a psycho henchman who -- coincidentally! -- has been following Eddie around all this time.<br /><br />More hijinks ensue.  The cameraman goes crazy with a continuous-zoom effect that travels the length of Manhattan island and ends up sprayed all over the seat in front of me.  Eddie beats his murder rap, the Loon is outsmarted, Eddie is on the road to the presidency, and he flawlessly orders another meal in a foreign language he doesn't know.<br /><br />And did I mention that the movie starts at the very climax of the story until Eddie jumps in as a voiceover to say that he'll now show us how he arrived at this point?<br /><br />What's most disturbing about this movie is that it validates the drug culture.  It shows, again and again, that we're not smart enough or athletic enough to solve our problems without pills.  Eddie is rewarded, repeatedly, for his habit: he becomes rich, he gets the girl back, he gets away with murder, and he's set onto the road of \\"limitless\\" fame and fortune.<br /><br />Oh, he says he's off the drug by the end of the movie -- he doesn't need it anymore -- presumably because he just thought his way out of it with his advanced intelligence.  After all, that's what Charlie Sheen teaches us, isn't it, that you can just blink your eyes and tap your ruby slippers to cure yourself of substance abuse.  Even if you believe that's possible -- and I hope by my tone you realize I don't -- Eddie's drug-free status at the end of the movie doesn't justify how he arrived there, which was by traveling the road of pharmaceutical assistance.<br /><br />Limitless is a slick-looking movie.  It's mostly fun to watch.  But it's kind of like a big candy bar -- maybe one laced with LSD.  The side effects and the bad aftertaste aren't worth it.meraman goes crazy with a continuous-zoom effect that travels the length of Manhattan island and ends up sprayed all over the seat in front of me.

Eddie is rewarded, repeatedly, for his habit: he becomes rich, he gets the girl back, he gets away with murder, and he's set onto the road of \\"limitless\\" fame and fortune.<br /><br />Oh, he says he's off the drug by the end of the movie -- he doesn't need it anymore -- presumably because he just thought his way out of it with his advanced intelligence.  After all, that's what Charlie Sheen teaches us, isn't it, that you can just blink your eyes and tap your ruby slippers to cure yourself of substance abuse.  Even if you believe that's possible -- and I hope by my tone you realize I don't -- Eddie's drug-free status at the end of the movie doesn't justify how he arrived there, which was by traveling the road of pharmaceutical assistance.<br /><br />Limitless is a slick-looking movie.  It's mostly fun to watch.  But it's kind of like a big candy bar -- maybe one laced with LSD.  The side effects and the bad aftertaste aren't worth it.
B00CL8DKE2|4.0|At this point, it's pretty much pointless to talk about whether or not Electric is the best Pet Shop Boys album since Very. Except possibly for \\"Thursday\\", which manages to evoke both \\"West End Girls\\" and \\"Love Comes Quickly\\", the closest thing in the Pet Shop Boys canon is Relentless, which has never been made available as a separate album.<br /><br />Electric has a definite energy to it, one that sometimes literally crackles. Only the aforementioned \\"Thursday\\" slows things down a bit--and the rap by Example is, well, kind of superfluous. Neil should have handled that part himself.<br /><br />But a lot of folks have already talked about the musical content of the album. That's not really the point of this particular review.<br /><br />If you're inclined to pick up a copy of Electric, but haven't done so yet, I strongly suggest getting it on vinyl. The nine songs are spread across two 45 RPM LPs--in fact, the track-by-track commentary by Neil and Chris is based on the vinyl format.<br /><br />Vinyl can be a troublesome, annoying format. You've got the inherent surface noise, plus the pops, clicks, and crackles that dust and other factors will introduce over time; to ensure maximum quality, you've got to take really good care of your records.<br /><br />But, in this case, there are two excellent reasons to opt for vinyl over CD and other digital formats:<br />1. Dynamic range. The LP has more of it. The digital formats (a download card for 192 kbps MP3 files comes with the album; if you buy through Amazon, 256 kbps MP3s are available to download at no extra cost) are significantly compressed, with clear signs of limiting and brick walling, and that horrible midrangey sound. [Which just goes to show how incredibly backwards things have become--i.e., the format with inherently greater capacity for dynamic range is now characterized by a marked lack of dynamic range, while the format whose dynamic range is limited by the characteristics of the processes and materials used to produce it is more likely to sound better (once its shortcomings are compensated for, anyway) than the theoretically pristine digital versions.<br /><br />2. The striking cover is eminently suitable for framing.<br /><br />If you like the album enough to want to be able to listen to it a lot, skip the CD and go with the LP. You won't regret it.ed to produce it is more likely to sound better (once its shortcomings are compensated for, anyway) than the theoretically pristine digital versions.<br /><br />2.

B002EDH0FE|4.0|A great movie was The Watchmen. Of course it was so long that I think my bladder ruptured, but it was surprising for a superhero movie, at least to me. Here we have your typical tale of men in tights in a place where cliched rain comes down constantly, especially when they're fighting. You can't shake a stick at a movie theater these days without pointing out some shlock where people fight in the rain -- that, or where something blows up behind them while they walk casually away, or where they leap headfirst away from an exploding something or other. . . . But I digress. I loved Watchmen. It was mature. The characters were complex. There were gray moral issues instead of just black and white ones. And it wasn't wall-to-wall action; they actually had a few slow moments to allow us to take a breath, which has the effect of making the action all that more memorable. The story was also morally ambiguous in some ways: you have to give kudos to a movie that has the balls to show a pregnant woman getting blown away in during the Vietnam War. (Well, okay, maybe there's nothing morally ambiguous about that part. But there were some morally ambiguous moments elsewhere. Really, really there were!)
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|I have Madeleine Peyroux's first cd and this one is almost as good. Her voice is about as close to Billy Holiday's as I have ever heard.
B0019LY5IM|3.0|This just ain't the best show on television.<br /><br />I watch it for the occasional flashes of brilliance when something truly powerful happens between the characters -- like when Ben's daughter was shot, or when Kate and Sawyer finally did the dirty in the bear cage. I'm less appreciative of the Rubik's Cube nature of the story, of it being some type of puzzle to be solved. To enjoy a puzzle, one needs faith in the creators that there eventually will be a payoff, that things will make sense, that there is a master plan. I'm not all that convinced that a master plan exists in this show, or if one does, that it makes a whole hell of a lot of sense.<br /><br />Two things particularly irk me about this show:<br /><br />The first is the non-chronological nature of the storytelling. The show is loaded with flashbacks and flashforwards -- this on top of a story with time travel -- which interrupt the telling of the story. The story has become so confusing that they frequently have to have retrospective episodes where a narrator rehashes the events of the past season -- in a more or less chronological fashion -- just so you're not as lost as the characters. The plotting of LOST looks like a train track assembled by a dyslexic meth addict.<br /><br />Worse, the flashbacks are sometimes dropped in like Band-Aids whenever the writers need to give a character a motivation. For example, in Wednesday's episode, the writers needed to explain Juliette's inexplicable change of heart about whether to support Jack in his plan to detonate an H-bomb. So, out of nowhere, they show a flashback of her as a girl, learning that her parents are getting a divorce. Her parents said something like, \\"Even if you love each other, it doesn't mean you're supposed to be together.\\" This memory of hers is then used to contrive her motivation for helping Jack, because she's suddenly decided she's not supposed to be together with Sawyer, and she repeats that line to Sawyer.<br /><br />The second thing that bugs me, as you've probably guessed, is the characters' frequent and unexplained changes of motivation. In that same scene where Juliette's support for Jack has suddenly changed, Kate's has also -- for no reason that I can tell other than that she's going along with the pack. Why, for instance, did Ben save Locke from suicide and then suddenly turn around and strangle him? In a subsequent episode, he vaguely gave a reason for this, but it didn't entirely make sense (nor could I have believed him if he did make sense because he's been well established as a compulsive liar). Jack is the worst character for motivations that shift in the wind. In the early seasons, getting off the island was all he wanted, and then later he's a drunken fool going around to his friends, yelling, \\"We have to go back!\\" -- a motivation supposedly brought about just because he's learned Locke has died. And then, once they're back on the island, he starts telling people, \\"We don't belong here!\\"<br /><br />Well, thank God for the people at the Shocklines message board, who have insightfully theorized about some of the larger things of the show. The current theory is that Jacob and the other dude are two Egyptian gods who are using the islanders as pawns in their machinations against each other. One of them apparently has the ability to shape-shift -- perhaps into the Smoke Monster -- which, if true, explains a lot of things in retrospect. . . . But I ask you, is it right to wait so many seasons for anything to have a shred of sense?<br /><br />God, why am I watching this show?<br /><br />And . . . when does the next season begin? I need to mark my calendar.that bugs me, as you've probably guessed, is the characters' frequent and unexplained changes of motivation.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  The cast is excellent and the story is truly delightful.  It's a film I rented once and had to own!
B002C4YYEU|3.0|A bladder-buster. (Glad I saw it at home.) It was a sentimental, unusual, and well done story, unmuddled by a sound track that got in the way. The only real objection I had to it was when Benjamin just up decides that he can't be a father to his daughter and abandons his family. That was completely out of character for him. Up until then, he had always been depicted as a devoted family man and somebody in complete acceptance of his condition -- and that everyone around him was in acceptance of his condition. It just didn't make logical sense that he would suddenly take off. Maybe the writers needed him to do that in order to satisfy their outline -- a cardinal sin of storytelling. Or maybe they finally realized the movie was getting too long and so had to compress part of his life. Whatever, it was a stupid plot development. The rest of the movie was great, though.

B002W1UEW4|1.0|As a writer, it's always instructive to watch a poorly written movie and to analyze what went wrong.<br /><br />Oh, maybe I'm being too hard on G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, a retelling of the cartoon I enjoyed as a kid, which itself was a rehash of an older entertainment franchise.  I mean, I did say to my wife, \\"Let's watch something mindless,\\" and I got what I wanted.<br /><br />Still, I can't help wondering if the movie makers intended for me to burst out laughing the first time the Baroness walks onto the screen looking like Sarah Palin in a skin suit.  Nor can I help wondering if, when the movie was finished, I was supposed to admit that I couldn't remember the main character's name.<br /><br />Somewhere between the underwater space battle, the ninja swordfight over the pit of crackling electrical arcs, and the evil doctor talking through a mask, I finally realized that this movie aspired to be Star Wars and failed miserably.  And I think the problem can be summed up in one elementary topic of story craft: character development.  Sure, I believe the original Star Wars had lots of revolutionary special effects for the time, and that's what all of us kids buzzed about as we ran around our lawns with our X-Wings making \\"pew!  pew!\\" laser gun sounds.  But I also remember being fascinated with the character dynamics.  By the end of Star Wars, I felt like I knew Luke, Han, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and C-3PO as well as members of my own family.  I never forgot their names.  Interest in where these characters were headed (and, of course, the cool special effects) brought me back for The Empire Strikes Back sequel. When the simulated space battles on the front lawn were done for the day, we sat down for long philosophical discussions about Darth Vader's revelation that he was Luke's father.<br /><br />G.I. Joe had all the ingredients of a great story like Star Wars, but they were undercooked and underseasoned.  The writers tried to establish character dynamics through the use of flashbacks rather than to let the present story do the work.  Characters contrivedly addressed each other by their names (\\"yes, we will work on that next, Storm Shadow\\") so the audience would learn those (corny) names and/or connect them to their previous cartoon incarnations rather than to let this information come out more naturally.<br /><br />The cinematography didn't help.  The frenetic, herky-jerky camera work made me nauseous at the same time that it prevented me from even understanding what was going on.  You don't need to move and shake the camera to film a good fight scene, you really don't, not unless the actors are so bereft of athleticism that you need to cover up their shortcomings.  (Yes, I'm talking to you, David Carradine, in the latter years of Kung Fu.)  Please, just pan back a little, and let me follow the action like a normal human being and not like someone flipping through comic book panels in fast motion.  Also, it's okay, really it is, to let a single camera angle last for more than two seconds.  I won't get bored, I promise.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just getting old.  Maybe I should just pull up the A&E channel and watch a black-and-white adventure story from the 1940s.  The characterizations in those are usually outstanding.  And because the directors no doubt were raised in the theater, the camera angles are always a good ten feet away from the subject, as if to film the events on a stage.

B008602KQI|1.0|The Hunger Games movie would have been a great adaptation of the novel by Suzanne Collins if not for the excessive use of the hand-held \\"shaky-cam\\" technique. Why don't we call shaky cam for what it is? Vomit cam.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just an old fogey and prefer the stable-cam cinematic style of True Blood. Is it too much to ask that I can see what's happening on screen and not just a blurry swoosh of color?<br /><br />I'm not alone in these criticisms:<br /><br />  The amount of dramatic shaky-cam in this movie is excessive. Multiple times I had to look away from the screen. The final fight, in particular, was almost impossible to follow. Shaky-cam + quick cuts + fast-paced fight scene + darkness = very hard to see.<br />  -- Panels on Pages<br /><br />  The Hunger Shaky-Cam Games -- I have just returned from watching a film about an epic romantic triangle between a director, his editing suite, and the shaky-cam that he couldn't resist.<br />  -- Robyn Paterson<br /><br />That last reviewer went on to make a comparison worth reading: \\"It's a good technique in moderation, and like any spice can really bring out the flavour of the film it's used in. But, just like ginger or pepper, if you use too much of it, the receiver won't be able to taste anything except the spice in question.\\"<br /><br />Exactly. While I don't object to the use of shaky cam per se -- I mean, it was an effective technique, like, once, in The Blair Witch Project -- it's just one tool in a director's tool belt and should not be used at the exclusion of all else.<br /><br />Remember 300? Lots of gorgeous comic-booky scenes of Spartans flying through the air with their swords. But every single spear throw and sword swing was turned into a slow-motion shot. Every. Single. One. (Or at least, that's what it felt like.)<br /><br />They're silly affectations by artistes. Gary Ross, director of The Hunger Games, admits as much in an interview:<br /><br />Q:  Let's talk about the look of this movie. You employed a lot of shaky handheld, and there aren't a lot of wide shots. How did you come up with that approach?<br /><br />A:  Well, I mean, I tried to do what the book did.<br /><br />Oh, come on.<br /><br />Q:  Because the book is told in the first person?<br /><br />A:  Yeah, it's a very urgent first-person narrative. I tried to put you in Katniss's shoes the way [author] Suzanne Collins put you in Katniss's shoes. I wanted to take you through the world using this kind of serpentine tunnel vision that Katniss has. I want to destabilize you the way Suzanne has and I want you to experience the world through Katniss's eyes, and that requires a very subjective cinematic style, to be kind of urgently in her point of view, so that's why I shot it that way.<br /><br />Let's see. That was effective, like, twice in the whole movie. Say, when Katniss rises up through the tunnel into the arena and is blinded by sunlight, and later when she is poisoned by genetically-engineered wasps. Those were the only two times when a point-of-view cam was arguably effective. The rest of the times, it was used to cover up possibly poor fight choreography (at least that's what I have to assume since I couldn't even see the damn fights through the smearing gloss of vomit cam) and a hundred other things. Maybe I should've taken a cue from my wife and just closed my eyes and listened.<br /><br />What a tragedy that is, because The Hunger Games was otherwise a brilliantly executed movie. The writing was good (due, no doubt, to Suzanne Collins herself being one of the screenplay writers), the costuming was gorgeous, the acting was great, the makeup was great, the special effects were great. But it was ruined by a director who wanted to leave his tripod at home. What a shame.<br /><br />To make an analogy, this goes back to a basic production value I have in my own prose writing. The reader should not be aware of the fact he is reading. Readers want to be transported away into their imaginations.To escape, just for a moment, the physical reality of their lives, to forget about the press of bodies around them on the subway, the screaming baby in the next room. So I strive to make my prose invisible. This means active sentence structure, an absence of flowery language, and simple to nonexistent dialogue tags. The cardinal sin is to step in front of the movie camera, so to speak, and wave at the reader, just to remind them that I am the artiste who created the thing they're trying to enjoy. And when movie directors are so enamored by their own power that they shake the hell out of the camera or slow down every fisticuff to 1/3000 speed, they're slamming their viewers back into harsh reality.<br /><br />Movie watchers pay too much for their tickets to have to be subjected to that. Give them their escape, Mein director! Treat them with respect, and they'll do the same for you.To escape, just for a moment, the physical reality of their lives, to forget about the press of bodies around them on the subway, the screaming baby in the next room.

B002RVCD0U|3.0|I liked Terminator Salvation a great deal although a majority of people seem to think it was dreadful crap. It reminded me a lot of the first Mad Max movie, and I thought it had a good story. Its one, glaring flaw, that I could see, came when the terminators in the Skynet concentration camp/factory didn't blow away Kyle Reese the instant they identified him. There was nothing in the movie that indicated Skynet didn't know that Reese was going to be John Connor's father, else why were they looking for him? Still, I don't understand why the movie is so widely hated. Maybe people are reacting to the radical departure in format from the previous movies: no Arnold this time, no time travel, no futuristic robot in a modern setting -- rather, lots of futuristic robots in a futuristic setting.

Folks strap on their virtual-realty visors and data gloves, select an identity for themselves, and log in to a collaborative, simulated universe of private planets, interstellar space ships, and magic.  High school student Wade Watts is one of its users.  From the book description:<br />~*~<br />  Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune--and remarkable power--to whoever can unlock them.<br /><br />  For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday's riddles are based in the pop culture he loved--that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday's icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes's oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.<br /><br />  And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.<br />~*~<br />For someone like me, who grew up in the 1980s, it was cool to read a book full of nostalgia I can appreciate -- rather than to read or watch some story about the 1950s or 60s and wonder how much cooler it would be if I had experienced its pop culture references myself.  It helps that author Ernest Cline, his character James Halliday, and I are all about the same age.  I remember playing Tempest, Pac-Man, and all the old arcade games that figure so prominently in the story.  I also grew up on the movies that play crucial roles in the plot, like WarGames and Back to the Future.  And I spent a far amount of time playing games on an Atari 2600 and the early text-based MMORPGs (on my dial-up, 2400-baud modem) that make appearances in this novel.<br /><br />Moreover, the story is suspenseful, the characters are interesting and distinctive, and the book ultimately has something meaningful to say about the nature of reality and personal identity.  I read it in about three days, and during that time I was agitated and distracted -- simply because I couldn't wait to power my Kindle back on so I could read more.  I can't be a good writer unless I cultivate my love of stories -- but because I am a writer, it's easier to see the seams in someone else's work and become jaded.  So it was nice to get really excited about reading something.  This is a book I wish I had written, and that's about the highest compliment I can pay it.<br /><br />The real test of whether something retains its 5-star rating with me is if I keep thinking about it.  I'm certainly excited from the recent experience of reading this one.  Will I feel that way a few years from now?  The Crimson Labyrinth, by Yusuke Kishi, had a 5-star rating on my Goodreads log until this morning, when I realized I couldn't remember what it was about.  This means it proved to be more of a chocolate cake than a nourishing, juicy steak.  We'll see which one Ready Player One turns out to be.

While I already had an interest in the story, I rushed to buy it around the time there were talks of the government pulling it off the shelves and the book held up to the hype. I personally didn't think it revealed any military secrets or anything that isn't already public information or that the terrorists don't already know.<br /><br />Mark Owen's first hand account of the Osama bin Laden's take down was remarkable. I was pleasantly surprised to read about Mark's background and his life outside the military. I think his accounts of military life were very uplifting and eye opening in a good way. I believe it gives great insight into our military's operations without giving away any secrets. I enjoyed reading about his other missions and what ultimately led him to the raid and demise of Osama.<br /><br />Great read whether you're a man or a woman.

B009AY04A8|3.0|Not a great game for the money but that being said I did have fun playing it.<br /><br />The graphics are nothing to shout about and the dialogue is EXTREMELY long winded. Many a time I was tempted to skip the dialogue but ofcourse that means losing the story (which mind you is quite entertaining). The characters are quite delightful actually and humourous at times.  The game play I not too difficult like some of these hidden object games can be and the hints regenerate so you can use them whenever you feel the need to.<br /><br />All in all , pirate advetures was a fun game and I do look foward to playing the sequel, if or when it becomes a free featured game :D

0307341550|4.0|I am now a fan of Gillian Flynn. Her writing style puts you directly in the story and makes you feel like you are the main character. You can not put this book down... trying to play detective is fun and the twist will blow you away!
B00271B752|4.0|Historical movie, in Alpacino born to cinema, he has the same intense character like in God Father, the theme of corruption is present now in NY or Miami Police, nothing have changed
0307341577|4.0|I kept hearing that all the Gillian Flynn books were good. So I finally broke down and bought 3 of them. I am glad I did...I have not put them down...I am on my third one now and they are all page turners. You will not be disappointed in this book. Very weird and twisted at times but good writing and very descriptive!!! Puts you in the book (even when you don't want to be lol)
B00499NHLC|5.0|Snappy dialogue, interesting storylines and great acting.  You won't be sad to have spent the time watching this fun series.
0345536886|5.0|John Grisham continues to keep the story and legal plot interesting even for those of us that are &#34;legally&#34; challenged.  Would recommend this to any who enjoy a good read.
B00B9366VO|4.0|Sound City is  a remarkable little slice of Rock and Roll history peppered with appearances by rockers that you surely love.  All the Foo are here along with Tom Petty,  Stevie Nicks and Neil Young.  The performance at the end with the surviving members of Nirvana jamming with P-Mac is worth the price of admission alone (hey, it's free with Amazon Prime)
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|My daughter MADE me watch the movie and to my surprise I thought it was cute.  Can't believe this is the same kid from About a Boy with Hugh Grant!
0345803507|5.0|I want more!!! Never thought I'd ever be into reading something like this.  But I loved reading these books. It just keeps you wanting more. If you haven't read this trilogy yet, you need to.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|The first Star Trek re-make was great. Better than all the other Star Trek movies to date, whether with the original cast or those from the Next Generation. This movie, &#34;Into Darkness&#34; has all of them beat by a long shot! The visuals are spectacular but the character interaction which is what made the series so appealing in the first place is not only maintained but enhanced. The only drawback is the audio download which was quite weak.

1452126607|5.0|I love this calendar.. I hang one on my fridge each year, and normally it's beach scenes, but I love Grumpy cat.. couldn't resist, and it met my expectations.. can't wait til January when I can hang it up!
0718178130|4.0|This is unquestionably a good book, and I can genuinely recommend it. It almost manages to be a great book, even. However, I've heard that some people on the autism spectrum (those who have what was formally known as Asberger syndrome) felt unfairly represented by it, and feel that Simson did not offer a nuanced enough representation of the disorder, instead playing it for humor. Readers will undoubtedly enjoy this book but should keep that in mind.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Would have given this game 5 stars except that it has an annoying ad that you have to pay to get rid of, other than that I absolutely love this game and am addicted. Will hate it when I run out of free jigsaws.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|although watchable for an adult, this movie more suited to a younger viewer.  I was bored at times ,especially by the non giant characters.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Best weather app yet . Pretty sky pictures.accurate stats.colors and contrasts realistic. Up to date.easy to read in very changeable weather area.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|as a star trek fan ,I loved this latest rebooting of the series.  I have no negative criticism.  I you  are a trekie this is a fresh take I think you'll enjoy.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Amazing special effects on this movie.  I had a hard time believing it was the same actor throughout the whole thing.  This was great for a Friday night and get the popcorn movie.
B00C25TCZ0|4.0|This release by Scott Gorham (ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist) and Co sounds like a Thin Lizzy &#34;lost album&#34; from the mid 70's with a better production. It is consistent throughout.  Singer Ricky Warrick sounds like Phil Lynott in his prime.Good, catchy songs with good riffs and excellent vocals.&#34; Bound For Glory&#34; (The single) sounds exactly like a Lizzy tune from the mid 70's with a classic riff and a great chorus. Other tracks that stand out include &#34;kingdom of the lost&#34; with it's &#34;Emerald&#34; like riff and structure and &#34;kissing the Ground&#34; with it's super catchy chorus. Any fans of Thin Lizzy or good solid hard rock will really dig this release. Definitely worth the purchase!
B0086700CM|5.0|fun, easy, and addicting game.  the concept of the game is easy but hard enough that you will keep playing over and over.  Also you can play for 1 minute or much much longer!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far, I have not had any problems with the app or had to purchase anything to play.  I wish there were photos on the first level, as I don't a'll ways know what I am looking for (halberd ?) But other than that I really enjoy it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great stellar astounding peaceful wistful timebending...<br /><br />Loved the music. Put it on continuous loop while you nap.<br />Amazon wants more words in this review.<br />Buy this music. You will not regret it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun bingo. Unique rooms. great graphics<br />free daily credits, spins and tournaments add teammates from f.b. for trading room items addicting
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Disc one of this three disc set was originally released in 1994 and other than a new mastering there's is nothing new. Disc two and three are both new releases. Disc two includes songs recorded and used in the movie but re-recorded and/or reworked for this release. Disc three is all new material inspired by the movie and includes some really great stuff.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This has been a great way to catch up on the first episodes of one of my favorite shows. Great way to fill the time when there is nothing good onTV.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy watching this together. We always miss it on network TV, so we are happy to watch it on amazon prime.
B008LV8TSU|2.0|the writing was juvenile.  Even though the Harry Potter series was written for teens/young adults the writing was so well done that all ages could enjoy them.<br /><br />Could not retain my interest.  Did not finish.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Solid scifi.  There are plot holes, as in most scifi.  You can look over the plot holes fairly easily, though, because of some decent acting and gorgeous visuals.  Special creature effects are by Patrick Tatopoulos, who you may know as a judge from the first two seasons of Face Off and the director of Underworld: Rise of the Lycans.

B001BKM3MQ|5.0|This is the CD that got me started listening to John Mayer.  Love the way he plays guitar.  Really love the bluey feel.  After this one  I started buying his other CDs
B0049J3QF4|5.0|I'm new to the Cars movies and am now a big fan of Lightening McQueen and Mater. These are movies that adults would enjoy even with out the influence of kids.
B00BLDD3A4|4.0|I had just finished watching the documentary that Dave Grohl had done about the recording studio Sound City.  What a great look at the music biz and the history of Rock n Roll.  There is a small sampling of the music that Grohl and others that had recorded with the revolutionary sound board used at Sound City.  I wanted to hear all of the music.  It is fascinating to hear the musical collaborations of the wide variety of rock and roll musicians, that includes Paul McCartney, Trent Reznor and Rick Springfield.  These are new and original recordings.  Pretty cool.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I wasn't sure that this was going to be a movie that I would like. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm still not invested in the cast, but this is definitely something that I'd like to own, and look forward to the movies to follow. I felt that it was loyal to the original movie line. I don't think that any of the movies have been loyal to the books that were written. I hadn't seen this story in print though. Fabulous special effects.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Completely overcome by the charm of this series. It is superior in acting and costumes and set. Really well done.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is more appealing British humor in an extended dramatic plot. Looking forward to season 3, and 4, and 5...
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Enjoyed the music choices and of course, love Mr. Groban's voice.  This CD didn't have the power of some of his other's, but I still enjoyed it.
1594746036|3.0|The best part of this book is the cleverness of a story integrating fascinating old-time photos.  Beyond that, the story is good, but not spectacular. I was happy to have read it, but don't go pushing it on friends.
B001HN694K|5.0|I really like Tim Burton's films, this is one of so many good things he directed, is a twist on the Walt Disney cartoon of I don't know when, but in the 50's. the copy I have, only says: 2004 reedition, is a little more hardcore, but hey, kids this days are not what we where in the 60's. what it could be considered a tale of terror by then, is now a tale of the battle betwen good & evil. &  good always wins.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I found this movie to be very funny and full of heart. I would watch this movie again and tell my friends.
B007L96VCY|5.0|I Was There! Actually, I was about 15 when this album was released. I was at a teenage party and they must have played the whole album about fifty (50!!!) times. At first, I didn't like it very well...by the end of the night; I knew all of the words and was rockin' out. (Can you imagine???...not liking it at first?...Sheesh.)
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Not the most creative ap I have ever seen, but it serves its purpose and that is really what I got it for.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have extreme tinnitus involving hearing loss & a brain hit by Lyme disease (& body of course) that began taking noise from memory files. (As explained by a tinnitus specialist) . I spent $4,000 on special hearing aids that input white noise onto corrected hearing. Operates by a remote control. I can't wear them to bed, at the quietest time when tinnitus is at its peak w several auditory noises & scrambled voices that are unbearable . As I'm bed ridden by Lyme disease ive looked for fill ins, a noise maker recommended by the tinnitus specialist cost $130. A box w only 2 noises I cud endure. I just recently came across this app. $1.99 I didnt expect much. (Forget the free version -pointless vs paying $2 for so much more) 40 sound choices, some permanent w some open to delete & replace (check all settings as you 'll find more sounds & a blog for suggestions)  it's easy to spend hours mixing sounds too. Max of 3 which you can save or delete as you evaluate the effectiveness. Note also : you can go in & change the pitch, volume of each to create a better balance.<br />  There are several white noises :white, pink, blue, violet, brown, grey - an assortment of water based -temperaments of rainfall & even what it hits upon (tent, car etc) w or w/o thunder /lightning, Amazon, crickets, loons, creaking wooden boat on water, airplane, fan, clothes dryer, Tibetan bowl, ocean waves, beach, crowds, city street, car passing by, hair dryer, vacuum, pine forest at night, frogs, streams, fountain, shower, chimes etc. No ads & unlike the free version, it plays while you're using your devise or can be set to stay on while you sleep. Clock w alarm as well. I can hear it better thru my kindle than thru CDs or boxes w fewer options. Highly recommend!!<br /><br />Just a footnote to developers /web programmers. - One can only rate /critique once which I've done. (I added this later) so why am I being asked to do so again? (& likely often) Not a flaw to deters but it's counterproductive.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am not a fan of Facebook's Aps for my android and tablet. It sucks the juice out of my devices, and really does not add to the web access.  I will stick to accessing FB through the web.
B00006NSGX|5.0|great sound much better than cd which I have also clear video and classic Clapton hits his best band as well definite recommend
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I almost gave this game 3 stars because I can't imagine working through the hundreds of included levels.  Once you get the hang of it, the game can get repetitive.<br /><br />ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S FUN AND HAS A SEEMINGLY PERFECT INTERFACE. I was dragging the scissors from button to button until I realized that you can simply tap the first and last buttons in your targeted line.  Much easier, and kinder to my stylus.<br /><br />This game provides good entertainment and doesn't deserve deductions for offering TOO MANY levels.  ***RECOMMENDED***
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The new Justin Timberlake Cd is better than I thought it would be.  I love the R & B songs.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent book. Well written and extremely interesting.<br />Gives a new perspective on an old subject that is intrugueing to every one. Where do we go after death.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Powerful story shared and told in such a loving and respectful way.  Enjoyable to watch and a beautiful ending.  Enjoy folks.
0062255657|5.0|Another book for the senses. Reading it fills your mind with lifeforms, and helps you dream in vivid colours.<br />The story is a bit childish though, a bit disappointing for some of us that are still waiting for another grown-ups novel from Gaiman.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app was good until I updated it now it sucks big time and is very hard to navigate. I do not recommend this.
B002ZG997M|5.0|I have watched this movie 4 days in a row since the purchase of the blu-ray.  Denzel Washington does not make crappy movies and this is one of his best along side of Courage Under Fire.<br /><br />Absolutely Amazing from the beginning to the end.
B000L53D4O|5.0|This is an awesome walker - my 9 month old grandson uses it all the time - it's his favorite!  He can stand but not quite walking on his own - he pushes this walker all over the place and sometimes he pushes from the activity side and plays at the same time!  It is the only thing that entertains him for any length of time.  I highly recommend it!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Watch it! There have been a fair number of lawyerly dramas the past 10 years or so. This is one of the really good ones!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The descriptions were exquisite. Sometimes the many characters were hard to keep track of, but this fantasy toyed with my imagination through the entire series.
B009K0P10K|5.0|We love it. We cant stop at just one episode, two or three episodes a sitting is the norm! I definately recommend this series to anyone who liked 'Dallas'. In fact, its so much more entertaining!
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Such a good read.real life drama,today's life issues for many a teenager in today's world,full of dysfuctional....enjoyed and shed a few tears .
B000UU4NE4|5.0|The basic reasons why this movie is hated on so much can be summed up like this:<br /><br />Peter's dance routine(s)<br /><br />High number of villains<br /><br />Mixed feelings over Topher Grace as Edward Brock Jr. aka Venom.<br /><br />Cut me a BREAK. First off, I and a lot of people found Peter's dancing routine funny; it reflected his now-dark, arrogant lifestyle; normal Peter Parker never would act like that, thinking he was all that and openly flaunting his arrogance.<br /><br />People complain about there being 3 villains in this. Seriously? I thought it was awesome seeing Venom and the Sandman teaming up, and the New Goblin doesn't really stay a villain too long, he's mostly there to complete the story arc of the Green Goblin, his father, from the first one. Having multiple villains in a movie isn't a new concept for super-hero movies or super-hero ANYTHING. I thought it worked well, seriously, tell me how the movie suffers from 3 villains.<br /><br />As for Topher Grace, eh, I guess I can kind of see why some people wouldn't like him. For my 2 cents, I always thought he looked a little like Toby McGuire in \\"That 70's Show\\" with his haircut, so I thought he was okay as Spider-Man's \\"evil twin\\" in this movie.<br /><br />As for everything else, seeing Peter Parker battle his own inner-demons personified in Venom is very interesting, and he suddenly snaps under the tension of everything he's going through. It's a very dark journey for Spider-Man. The whole movie's plot is interconnected revenge; Harry Osborn, the New Goblin, wants revenge on Peter for killing his father, Peter wants revenge on the Sandman for killing his Uncle Ben, and by the end Sandman and Venom both want revenge on Peter. Harry and Peter have to set aside their demons to work together and save Mary Jane, who was caught up in all this.<br /><br />Loved this movie, and it seemed like a lot of people did when I first watched it. Don't know why it became one of those movies that was \\"cool\\" to hate on. The flaws are nitpicking, from what I've heard, and it's not enough to bring the movie's quality down for me.te on.

B00DQAM5LI|3.0|Pros<br />-Amazing tones (The recording, Mixing, Mastering) The production is just perfection. Some of the best I have EVER heard. It's very refreshing to hear.<br />-More charismatic than there previous work. Just the subtle things in the recording. Not glossy or constantly \\"Safe\\" to the point it would drag you down after too many listens.<br />-Writing is different. So it's refreshing to hear.<br /><br />Best parts of album (Maybe only part necessary for them to have even wrote)<br />-All of requiem except the chorus and the talking part in the bridge was ridiculously long and borderline corny<br />-This means war's chorus was extremely simple but very powerful, and great that it was so different than there more melodic choruses.<br />-All the guitar solos were great and original for syn<br /><br />Cons<br />-plain melodies, Lack of harmonies, terrible sloppy vocal arrangements, and his singing? \\"Does he sing or scream?\\" You ask. Well sometimes he just flat out yells the same thing without much melody or rhythm. This means war's verse is so aggravating to listen to, it sounds like like a sloppy rip off of SAD BUT TRUE, with a more exotic filler in the melody rather than a bluesy one topped off by some random chords at the end<br />-basic song structure. Not that AABA is a bad thing. It's the fact that everything is is so separated instead of harmonies, more instruments, I know I'm going to hear a typical plain verse, Chorus, and Guitar solo.
B001UJUGZO|5.0|I've become something of a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan after discovering Buffy and I'm always looking for more of her movies. This one kind of reminds me of The Return which I also reviewed. The one thing I learned from watching this movie is that every time you think you know what is going on they throw a curve and twist in it. Briefly Sarah plays Jess and early in the movie Jess's husband and his brother are in a head on collision with each other. They both wind up in a coma and eventually one of them wakes up and that's when the fun begins, all is not as it seems. If you're in to movies that make you think and pay attention then you will like this one and I recommend it. One of the cool special features is an alternate ending that is worth a look too.
B000005S5N|5.0|A-ha still remain very electronic in with this album (like their initial one, &#34;Hunting High and Low&#34;) but it's definitely not as peppy.  But I think the thing that a lot of Americans miss is that it's ok to write darker stuff too.  Different songs/sytles for different moods.  Unfortunately, A-ha waned in the U.S. with this album, though they continued until 2010 in Europe.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|great movie and very quick. it was a real easy purches and was just great to watch on my roku box
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Bought 2 of these, one for myself and one for my girlfriend. My gf went to use it for the very first time and the connector piece that plugs into the phone pulled right apart and got stuck in her phone. She had to get plyers to pull it out and ended up shocking herself in the process. Returned that one. 3 weeks later the one I kept now has me jiggling both the cig lighter plug end and the piece that goes into my phone. What horrible products these are! And to think that I could have gotten a legit Apple car charger for the exact same price. This is not the first time I have had issues with crappy Griffin products but it will definitely be my last!
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather works wonderfully.  I love that while connected to Wifi it is running in the background.  Getting notifications that severe weather is coming is great!  I find the forecasts and weather outlooks are very accurate.
0446310786|5.0|I have always wondered about the title of this book, I have come up with a higher respect and understanding of the story and the writer as I have tried to make a sense of it and here is my opinion on the subject:<br /><br />The Mockingbird that is being killed might have reference to the child's belief in the justice system and all those who are supposed to protect everyone from crimes.  What happens to an innocent African-American defendant, although true and totally unacceptable is only one side of the truth.  The cover-up of another murder (spoiler alert!) that takes place at the end and by none other than those three people who are aware of it and are supposed to be on the side of Justice For All, namely Atticus, The Judge and the Sheriff is the real story here.  They not only decided to drop all charges, they also convinced an innocent child, an actual witness to the crime, to join them and lie about it.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This product worked very well for a year and a half. On August 25 it just stopped synchronizing with my Yahoo account. It isn't able to do anything anymore. I don't know if it updated and got a bug, but there is also no way for me to sign this app out of my Yahoo account and sign back in again. I hope this can be fixed, but for now, I have to give this product a bad review. If things get fixed, I will edit this review to something much more favorable.

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|Please note that I am quite meticulous on the conditions of my purchases and this item would have rated 5 star, but the DVD case arrived with large &#34;razor knife&#34; slash across the face, penetrating colored insert beneath.  The damage to the product was my only disappointment.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Man's ego as spoken of by Freud and Jung has never been more than a vague &#34;thing&#34; to me. It was a name we gave to people who were self-centered and overbearing. But what exactly is an &#34;ego&#34;? Until reading Eckhart Tolle's book A New Earth, I didn't know. I do now, though, or at least I agree with what Tolle thinks it is. His theory of it and its behavior seems workable to me.<br /><br />I don't think there's anything actually new in this book. The fundamentals of man's condition here on Earth have been written about many times in many ways and mostly from an Eastern religious point of view, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. It is the ego, they say, that overpowers our true selves, causing division rather than unity so we have &#34;enemies&#34; and strife rather than companions and peace. It gives us titles to become attached to and defensive about. It is the ego that keeps us stuck in the abuses of the past or obsessed with the promises of the future rather than living in the present moment. The very hip book Be Here Now by a former Harvard Professor with the Hindu moniker Ram Dass had essentially the same message back in the 70's.<br /><br />But A New Earth reveals this same wisdom in a sensible and easy-to-understand way, using today's Western realities. It frames ego in 3-D, then disassembles it so we know what it looks like and what it does and how to deal with it. And that's the most important thing to me, how to deal with it. I'm not aware of a previous approach to the subject like this.<br /><br />I found it fascinating and helpful and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is working on getting a grip on life.<br />BR
B000JQUHLM|5.0|It was easy to find this book in the free selections and I found it brought back memories of the Pollyanna books I read as a child.  It was fun to read about the &#34;glad game&#34; again and I think I will begin applying it to my life.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|This is a great movie, the only negative would be that while streaming it I had to refresh because the player just froze. Just a great story of getting revenge against the bad guys and the failed crimial justice system, not sure if you'll like it, watch it you wont be disappointed..
B00BDAP66E|2.0|I don't like it because in order to post an event for my Page, I have to let it know my location, which is ridiculous. The only people that are going to come to the event are those who already know where it is.
1451620829|3.0|Being a life long Kiss fan made me look forward to reading about one of my heroes right? Peter turned out to be the biggest looser, I read Gene and Ace's books too and out them all, Peter's is the best written. Reading Ace's book is like trying to follow some Schizophrenic, ADHD burned out rocker on acid. Makes as much sense, he jumps from one thing to the other with no connection what so ever. I was really looking forward to reading it. Kiss fans do yourself a favor don't read Gene, Ace or Peter's books it changed my adolescent view of my heroes. If you want to read about a bunch of luckier than lucky guys who became millionaires and did nothing but complain complain waste more money than I'll ever earn, have orgies and kiss other men than okay read them. Ace is a glue sniffing wife cheating cocaine alcoholic nazi sympathizer and Peter is the biggest wife cheater drug using complainer who had the dream the brass ring and he pissed it away because of his ego and drug dependency.. All of them including Paul are horrible human beings and I will never buy a cd or go to another concert again, no more tshirts  nothing, How Gene and Paul can market Kiss with the space man and cat man with out Ace and Peter is only explained by greed. My favorite band growing up has been forever tainted in my mind. I want my $$$ back for all the poster, lunch box, remote controlled van, cd's, albums and cassettes I've purchased.. Ace,Peter and Gene's books are only worth reading if you want to find every reason under the sun to no longer like this band and your child hood heroes.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Very fun game with great fun visuals and entertaining game play. I enjoyed the concept as well funny idea and silly monkeys always make things fun.
0446569909|5.0|Ozzy is not a burn out after all, this book is funny, well written and out of all the rock star auto biographies I've read (6) this one is the best. I even read the one Rudy Sarzo (his original solo bass player) wrote and I just enjoed this one so much more. I read 150 pages the first day, couldn't put it down.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I always \\"get\\" stuff when I'm laughing and when the<br />author gives CONCRETE, real-life examples and<br />there are PLENTY in this!!!<br /><br />It can change your life starting TODAY!!!<br /><br />THANK YOU PAM!!!!!<br /><br />Thank you, LOUISE, for mentioning it on Fb!!!<br /><br />- Hil
B004SDEP38|5.0|This app makes taking work home or doing work on the road easy. Wait, is this a good thing? Smile
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I really like this game! This is the type of game I'll play over and over again just for the gameplay. Perfect for the phone, but I'd love it on any portable format! Really fun, really enjoyable!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|From other reviews i had high expectations of this app.  Either I am not using it correctly or it is just a good basic Bible app. Also, not appreciating all the emails.
B00CFO7PK2|5.0|A brilliantly authentic singer regardless of whether one speaks their language or not,<br />is able to stir the emotions deep within the psyche and soul of the listener.<br />Buika engages through every nuance of sound she utters, the listener is transfixed.<br />In the midst of our trite, bubblegum pop music culture... real artistry still exists. Hope burns eternal.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is an easy quick calculator to use when you are out and about town. My kids use it frequently to figure out if they have enough for a purchase.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|DS9 has always been my least favorite of all of the Star Treks, but it's starting to grow on me.  Heck, any excuse to look at Terry Farrell!  The characters, like any series, take a season or two to develop, and I'm in Season 2 and things are smoothing out.  I think I was initially put off because there is no &#34;ship&#34;, it's a station, but the wormhole provides a constant stream of new characters for the regulars to interact with.  Did I mention Terry Farrell is on the show?
B00634GHJA|3.0|I am not a techie and could figure out how to use this app.  Seems to be user friendly for basic use.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app helped me start reading! Love exploring new authors I would never think of picking up. The sample feature is my favorite.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|A quick hand everyday keeps the work doldrums away.  However, the constant barrage of trying to up-sell gets to be annoying!
B002VBV1S6|4.0|Recommended by my son as more real than a lot of fantasy novels. While not as dark as &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;, the characters are thoroughly well developed, and winter certainly comes.
B0064BWE8U|3.0|A fairly week story line, a little short and finishes abruptly.  Probably not her best work but fills the time
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill and Paul Franklin caught the essence of Bakersfield music.  I recommend this CD for any one who likes the California country music.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Another spectacular story line by Jodi Picoult.  As usual children and families feature front and centre.  Beautifully written with empathy, accusation and grief all intertwined.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|However; This movie was very good. It was easy to identify with the characters. McConaughey was excellent! I also very much enjoyed the &#34;Father&#34; of the young man. I will so watch this again.<br /><br />MH
B002RI9HUM|4.0|A slightly different formula in that it is a single story line in this book, but part of the Walsh family series.  Certainly worth a read.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I fell asleep before the movie ended, couldn't keep my interest very long, movie seemed to quiet, not enough actions scenes.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|As a babysitter, when I saw this listed as free, I decided to take it for a spin. Upon opening the app, the first thing that came to mind was the graphics, bright colours, smooth interface, well-designed. I opened the game and the only issue I had was some confusion of what to tap. There was such flexibility of what you can do. Every game was simple yet engaging. Then came the real test. Two kids I was babysitting this afternoon, one seven, one three. They absolutely loved it. Their favourite parts were putting stickers on the suitcase and lost and found. It was an excellent game to keep them occupied while I was preparing lunch. All in all, definitely worth it. Once I get more money on my Kindle Fire, I look forward to purchasing other Dr. Panda apps.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Action packed and thrilling!  Kept me guessing thru the whole movie, could have left out the girl, she wasn't really part of the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Loved this game. Great for passing time. Had a ton of rewards and I don't even know what level I was on but it was way up there. I went in the other day, shortly after playing over 100 coins and gaining new prizes, and it looked funny. I realized it was back on level one. No prizes, no anything. It had completely started over. Very disappointing.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|De NIro is such a good actor, love to watch him in any movie that he is a part of.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game need more like it. Use your own money and be the best. I'm on my way to the top but I need more allies
B003VANOFY|3.0|it's a great quiality of music, and works excellent, but my son have dropped it and it got broken even though he said before i made the order that it's unbreakable, only if you are gentle... not for kids
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great blend of various characters & story lines. The time period was a great choice with so many modern inventions coming into being & the adjustments certain characters had with them. Wardrobe is awesome & the Abbey itself is beyond words!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is an awesome app it tells me great things and always keeps me posted on the weather plus it's got rewards what more could I ask for !
B008MEM24S|4.0|I really like Perry so when I saw this silly game I thought &#34;why not&#34;.  It's not very difficult but it's still fun & it's an enjoyable time waster if you've got bus or train commute.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I truly enjoy just looking @ fish tanks. It's a very peaceful and beautiful experience. To build your own fish tank, is truly a fun, joyful task. One I rellish a great deal!!! Please keep the games coming...<br /><br />  Respectfully,<br />  &#60;Mika'il Abd'allah&#62;
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I don't really know why I'm so into this game. I have the original on another device, which I also recommend. The nom nom is just to cute & the kids love it. I love watching them figure out how everything is going to work.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|Some of the scenes are a little off but Hollywood did not ride the boats so you can't expect them to  look actual but it was good for a movie.
B0063M22QO|2.0|I thought this would be a computer against you in Mahjong, but it's a matching game. Not impressed and frankly it's very boring.
B006S01GH2|3.0|If you like a French Comedies that are a bit offbeat, this one is for you.  Amelie a social misfit do-gooder who is trying to find her purpose and passion in life.
B00B769XB8|4.0|reviews on this movie were bad.  I watched it and liked it.  The cast is first rate, the plot moves right along, the effects are first rate.<br />The movie is set up for a sequel but I doubt one will be made.  If you get a chance, and like this type of fantasy/adventure  give this one a look
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|It looks like it has a ton of nice features, but it wasn't learner friendly. I wanted a tutorial or decent help file.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Loved the continuing story arcs and plot lines.  Sad that MGM & SyFy killed the show. Hoping that someone picks up the show and completes seasons 3 - 5.
B00819ER0Q|5.0|Peter Weir has made a lot of interesting films but this is my favorite. Brilliant, iconic performance by Ed Harris, wonderful work by Jim Carrey. Pre-dated & presaged reality tv. Not to be missed.
B001JIDE3M|5.0|Fun story with great monologues! Very entertaining for all ages. Will be looking for the sequel to come out on Amazon.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was so taken with this book. I read it as quickly as I could because it's that awesome. And for the price you can't beat it
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I did like this movie. Was not able to stay awake for the first GI Joe for some reason but this one kept my attention.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Great movie the soundtrack is just as great. I have listened to it over and over and over. thanks so much
0061122416|1.0|An allegorical novel in the tradition of &#34;good things happen to those who think positively.&#34;  If you're not personally inspired by that sentiment, don't buy this book.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|its good but when you update it can take a few weeks to play again and other bugs but when you get playing I like it but plz fix update gameloft.
B003VANOFY|1.0|My son like the first one as the sound was amazing. The thing just disintigrated.ear pads fell apart, then it just stopped working. the second one was constantly having software connection problems...Went with a different brand . Happy son now...
0571238343|5.0|This is the Bible of animation. Incredibly beautiful and insightful. It really is a survival kit. I keep it out as a coffee table book too.
B00023B1AS|5.0|I enjoyed there greatest hits album. there albums are great to get. this one is for any fan of zz top.
B00197U0DU|5.0|I enjoyed the early stuff of there's and this one is for any fan of there first album of genesis.
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|Very witty if you know any Shakespeare at all.  If you read Romeo & Juliet in high school, you will really enjoy the twists.
B007YLEMDE|5.0|This is a great one to get if you like his greatest hits and his music. this is for any fan.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I would not have enjoyed Inception's action, suspense, explosions, and mind bending special effects if it was not also refreshingly original, touching, and thought-provoking. Inception left my family intrigued by its premise and touched by what happens to the characters rather than numb from an onslaught of action and noise. I've seen it twice and would be glad to watch it again.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|I enjoyed there albums and this one is a good one to get if you are a fan of there music.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Definitely worth watching, great acting and great story lines.  Highly recommend.  Great cases, up-to-date issues and good back stories as well!
B008J34466|5.0|This is a great one to get if you are a fan of her back in 2001 and now. her albums are great.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|a fairly slow developing thriller with way too many unbelievable &#34;murder for hire&#34; plots in the same subdivision, while the for hire murderer as well as the &#34;boss&#34; all live as neighbors - Come on...
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Funny as heck. Didn't expect it to be so good. Saw the sequel and it was even better hit girl was the best
B002PA1HHI|4.0|American Psycho is a surprisingly funny movie. Patrick Bateman is supposed to embody all the worst qualities a man can have. But instead of coming across as the ultimate chauvinist pig, he comes across as a vain, bitchy homosexual. Fussing over one's appearance and popular music (as Bateman does) is a preoccupation of gay men. The book was written by a homosexual and directed by a woman (apparently a feminist), so perhaps this is why the insight here is a bit skewed. It is a homosexual's, or a feminist's, idea of a chauvinistic, egotistical male. It is an amusing caricature nonetheless.<br /><br />There are scenes that do capture the sort of male Bateman is supposed to represent. One of them had me in stitches. The scene features Bateman seated at a restaurant with some co-workers, where he delivers a sanctimonious speech about the need to end apartheid, provide for the homeless and fight for women's rights. Of course, Bateman believes none of this (prior to the scene, Bateman kicks a homeless man to death; and when he isn't objectifying women, he's concocting fantasies about murdering them). The speech is so phony that one of Bateman's co-workers cracks up. He can see right through it. That sort of empty moral posturing is typical of Bateman's type and it is quite artfully satirized in the scene.<br /><br />Bateman says that there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, but that as a person he simply doesn't exist. I take this to mean, not that Bateman is a psychopath, but that he's an instantiation of a Platonic ideal. He's an archetype of a narcissistic man. This is why his co-worker Paul Allen confuses Bateman with another co-worker, Marcus Halberstram. Even Bateman's own lawyer does this, calling him \\"Davis.\\" Bateman is interchangeable with the other employees--he could be any one of them. The company is full of Patrick Bateman's, so he might as well be Marcus Halberstram or Davis.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the imaginary murders are supposed to mean. Bateman ostensibly murders his ex-girlfriend and a hooker, but when he returns to the scene of the crime there is no trace of the bodies. Bateman murders Paul Allen, but Bateman's lawyer claims that he ate lunch with Allen after the murder. However, the lawyer confuses Bateman with another man named Davis, so it's possible that he confused Allen with someone else. We never see Allen after the murder and a detective is hired to investigate his disappearance. And how did Bateman get into Allan's apartment to leave a message? I'm thinking Bateman did murder Allen, but maybe not the women. Some of this is obviously in Bateman's head (the ATM machine did not really tell him to stuff a kitten inside of it, and he didn't blow up those cop cars).<br /><br />Here I was expecting a gory thriller, but it turned out to be a satire, and an amusing one at that.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I mean is there anything else to say this movie fits right in with all the other trek movies of awesomeness
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book truly helped me understand myself much better. I'm proud to be an introvert now. Im starting to pick out other introverts around me too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters remind me of people I know and their stories are realistic and touching. 5 more, Stick it up yours
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|It's a classic game & fun to play on my Kindle. It's great when you're on-the-go & waiting for an appt.
B00BEIYLAW|3.0|Having been a fan of Steve Jobs since the 70s, view Ashton as the See's of eye candy and an alumni of the Cupertino campus, there were multiple allures that made my attendance practically mandatory. Two near full theater viewings of &#34;The Butler&#34; in 48 hours, the lackluster #7 debut on the weekend box office was not that difficult to predict with some of the worst reviews (27% Rotten Tomatoes) and less than a half dozen on a Saturday matinee in a San Francisco Bay Area showing in attendance, &#34;Jobs&#34;, will come and go faster than group speed interviews.<br />Ashton Kutcher does a great physical reenactment pushing up Steve's built in intellectual sensuality quotient several more notches. The movie does a good job in recreating a pre-Silicon Valley South Bay landscape. There may not be any awards awaiting this cinematic endeavor, but, &#34;Art Direction&#34; and &#34;Cinematography&#34; is not out of the question.<br />Steve Jobs was no saint nor was he begrudgingly un endearing. The biggest flaw committed is the demonizing of Jobs morphing from a transcendental meditating hippie college dropout to a fully realized capitalist abusing and misusing the ethics of the millennium era global trade industry.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game can sometimes be a challenge when one is as game-challenged as I am!  I think most gamers enjoy the simplicity of this type of game.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Lots of killing blood suckers awesome game. But only better if you can buy gems with game money not real money. Free game downloads help a little.
B001EBYM62|5.0|They don't make men like Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor anymore. A feel-good movie full of joy and wonderful music, Singin' in the Rain never disappoints!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series is great and had such a nice soft soap opera feel at times - but I loved the courtroom drama and how our heroine became a very good lawyer in spite of all the difficulties.
1401938906|5.0|You have to try this book and the experiments. Just try one. One that tempts you, or one that &#34;can't possibly work&#34; and be aware.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I had not read any reviews of this book before reading it and expected the usual Baldacci thriller. Boy was I surprised. I found a very interesting and sentimental read that was very different from any of his other books-most of which I had read. I liked the story, how it was told and found myself actually tearing up at thr end.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Simple set up but difficult enough to keep you interested past the first couple of stages.  Never hard enough to totally stump you , either.!?
B00A27X972|4.0|The second half of the book became a little silly and I started to loose interest but did finish it.  It was not something that I would rave about but did enjoy.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Great CD! Highly recommend this. Great variety of songwriting/ style from ballad to the s@#t that made 5 finger death punch famous!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Kept me interested the entire time. Really enjoyed it. The puzzles were not too difficult but it still kept me thinking. no bugs or issues. looking for more games like this. I give it an A+
B00BNNJHXO|4.0|The last time I paid any attention to Soilwork was in 2005, when they released Stabbing The Drama, one of the worst albums I've ever bought. Especially disappointing how legendary their early releases are (The Chainheart Machine being my personal favorite). Yet, the openning black metal blasts of Spectrum of Eternity, the first single of The Living Infinite, rekindled my interest in a band that I could once proudly call my favorite metal band.<br /><br />The Living Infinite is a good album, and a drastic improvement from Stabbing The Drama. Don't expect a return to the glory days, but it seems like Soilwork has rediscovered their roots and even taken on some new influences; note the doomy dirge of Owls Predict, Oracles Stand Guard. Dirk Verbeuren's drumming stands out as the album's driving force, and I can only say I'm happy to no longer be able to understand most of Strid's lyrics, which have always been a little embarrassing.<br /><br />Grab your plow, pick and shovel, it's time to rock.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Heartbreaking and beautiful all at the same time. Young kids dealing with serious issues, but in such a beautiful and mature way. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Although this device is still in it's infancy I see limitless potential in the future for thiis little dongle. Google has really outdone themselves this time especially with the price point.<br /><br />The purchase of this gadget is really a no brainer if you purchased this with 3 months of free Netflix. With Netflix running $8 a month this unit essentially is only selling for $11. For what it can do and what it can potentially do in the future, this $11 investment is very miniscule. You'd spend just as much or more on 2 trips to Starbucks, why not put that towards something you can use for much longer?<br /><br />Being able to control YouTube and Netflix with nothing but your TV, Chromecast, Android device and an internet connection is such a convenience, in my opinion. I can't wait until there are more features. The ability to sling the content on your computer from the Chrome browser definitely opens things a bit. With continued support from Google and 3rd party developers, I see a very bright future for this little device.<br /><br />There aren't very many cons about this device. Only cons I can think about relate to the limit 3rd party support it currently has....or lack of, but that's something that will definitely be remedied in due time. It is a very new product.<br /><br />In the past I've used my PS3 to stream media, to connect to Netflix or YouTube but it could be troublesome to navigate with just the on screen keyboard and UI. With this you have all of the control with a very familiar setting that is your Android phone, Android tablet, PC, or iPhone.<br /><br />When you purchase this item it comes with everything you'll need. The device itself, an HDMI extender, and a powered USB cable to power the device itself if your HDMI port is not powered. I guess the only thing you'll need is a TV with an HDMI port. Good thing is that most people who have a TV, do.<br /><br />I think everyone should get one just to experience the convenience and fun factor fo this great media doo-hickey.great media doo-hickey.
140006922X|5.0|Brilliant story from historical basis. Clear eyed look at the world's biggest myth ever. Answers questions I've been asking since ai was in Sunday school.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Loved the story and one of my favorite classics.  My goal is to read the classics that I missed growing up with.  This was terrific
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's reminds me of another version of Temple Run but in a subway with cool effects.  My grandson loves this game.  I didn't know that he had it until he was bragging about how good he was at it.  If you like Temple Run games then you would like this one as well.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Definitely a favorite classic -  Had no idea what the story was about .  The two main characters showed such love for each other in their own way
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I play it all the time, especially when there's nothing to do! It helps me relax.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great show!  Love every episode. Love to watch them over and over again. Can't wait for the newest season to begin.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Written in a strange way but once you get used to that it is an easy read. As with all stories about the holocaust it is extremely sad in many places but also uplifting. Many, many people showed their great compassion for others and did not blindly follow Hitler. The power of the written word yet again proves how valuable it is!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Good action movie with some &#34;old &#34; fav actors. Only I did not like the cursing that was used in the movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Itz yummi<br />f etch Serb high Dhabi sch sch sci sch sch sec it's ghoul ssh eh ebb ebb ebb ebb hmm hmm
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is a good read, but nothing new is explored since these ideas were first brought forth almost 150 years ago.<br /><br />That said, this is a good rehash of the tension between the historical Jesus, and the Christ that has emerged over the past 2000 years.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I think writing down a review should be optional. Just like how it used to be. I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day. But now we can't send a rating until we give a review on the product we ordered. I used to only write a review if there was something wrong. I f not, then I give five stars. I don't time to write a review for everything I order so I'll just copy and paste this on every order. MAKE THIS SECTION OPTIONAL. Thank you and have a great day!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job on the whole trilogy I've read every single hunger games book and I'm hooked  I started reading these books last summer in 2012 and and now I re read them my favorite book(s) of all Time!

B001QB5S3G|5.0|A wonderfully directed and accurate movie with Top actors Robert Deniro and Jeremy Irons. One of Deniros best !! Watch and make your own decision !!
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|It's a very good dictionary. The only downside is that  it doesn't have a lot of regional Austrian vocabulary, and since I'm reading an Austrian novel I often have to check the Duden.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like temple run you'll love this game. Love the minions.  My 3 and 7 year old love it too. Highly addictive too.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I paid 99 cents for this. Wow. Her music is great. Great for listening while waiting on a bench in a park or on a train. It is definitely chill music.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just like any other, Nicholas Sparks book, super sweet, great story line. Book was way better than the movie. I enjoyed it.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|I enjoyed this book, and recommend to anyone interested in knowing more about how our brains tick, and how we make decisions, both consciously, and unconsciously.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|After a very painful experience of trying to upload music and videos onto my Kindle HD<br />This software is worth every penny and is a credit to its author<br />I was ready to throw the Kindle HD out of the window .. until WiFi File Explorer PRO came to my rescue<br />Very pleased with this product is an understatement<br />I can recommend this as the best, easiest to use and most functional software
B004132HZS|5.0|What a refreshing Sherlock Holmes. I've seen them all. Benedict Cumberbatch was an excellent choice for Holmes. A must see for any Sherlock Holmes fan.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Loved the first 2 movies, Part 3 is OK. These are supposed to be re-mastered while part 2 and 3 look great, the first movie video is not great because of the poor print copies it was made from, some parts look great and 10 minutes later there is a ton of film grain that make it look less than 480P. I rented a DVD Netflix version of part 1 and it was terrible from the poor copy it was made from.<br />In the Blu-Ray bonus part &#34;re-mastering the Godfather&#34; it explains the problems they encountered with doing it and why some parts of the video are so-so, No preserved master copies were saved.
B003O86MY8|5.0|David Garrett was a nice surprise when I saw him on PBS a few weeks ago.  I downloaded 2 songs for my ipad and bought this album and liked about 90% lf the songs which is a lot for me. Highly recommend it
B008MEM24S|5.0|My four year old Grandson and I love it. It is really fun to play and the we will continue to have fun with it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|A different kind of  Holmes, Benedict Cumberbatch is great. Looking forward to season 3 which is on pre-order. Much better on disc.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a nicely made game. Cool downs on certain activities are too long and prices for other horses are silly but it is kind of addicting.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I loved every page of this book the ability of the author to bring you into the lives of the different characters. The story attached to the different characters was filled with history and  emotion.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|fast action, twist from the old series, this new time-line developed from the first of the series,  I hope more to come.
B003V4ASV8|1.0|A wonderful book.a great insight into the lives of the North Koreans. The suffering of the people and the lengths they go to to survive.I thought the saddest part of it all was how the people showed no loyalty to one another.I found it hard to put down but also found it had a very thought provoking effect on me.
6302794331|5.0|It is very cute movie, our kids like it and tape is good condition. Thank you and have a great day!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Amazing singers, real artists, 3-Tenors and 1-Baritone, all 4-have different voices. Their vocal skill and the sincere genuine expression feeling they sing every song makes the interpretation of the songs come to life.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|It is very good movie, we like it and DVD is good condition. Thank you and have a good day!
B001NZEHMS|5.0|was going to buy a couple of their singles.but when I saw price for whole download.it was a bargain,kinda grew up in that era and sounds better than some of the hip hop today back in the day rap to me is better than todayrap/hip hop
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like Davinci Code-like puzzle games, this is the one you want. It's hard to get a good game for one dollar, but this is a steal for the low price. Can't wait for the next one!
B001NA6096|5.0|How many movies could sustain your interest enough to listen intently to two people getting to know each other? Before Sunrise accomplishes this and much more!
B003BM374K|5.0|I enjoy this movie a lot! Nice mellow story, interesting characters. It's not fast pace but not boring either it's just a feel good watch :)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is pretty awesome for a ccg app. It's an excellent way to try out magic the gathering, and to see if you'd like to get into the physical game. It's also good enough to be more than an introduction and a great stand-alone ccg app. I'm also really enjoying the soundtrack.
B006DZYM0A|3.0|The movie is very dark!  and I don't mean lighting.  It was interesting subject matter and made you think &#34;what would I have done?&#34; and the ending resolves some of the ethical issues.  But it makes me worry about where society is heading in cases of doing what is ethical and fair and owning up to one's own culpability.  This movie is mostly about how a young girl faces up to her culpability accepts the consequences of her actions to correct an ethical mistake she made.  She definitely matured during the film.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This was a good throw back on an old tale with a good spin. It's a good adventurous, family movie for sure.
B00DC3DGSK|3.0|I love Buddy Guy and have seen him live several times since I live in Chicago and his club is here, but the last few CD's he has but out are just okay.  I know if I saw him perform the songs on this CD it would be awesome because of his stage performances but on CD, it loses luster.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and now I own it on Blu ray! I could watch this a million more times and still would want to watch it a milion more. So happy that I finally own it!
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  My husband and I were hiking last summer when we met a group of young men and women who were very close to completing the PCT. They had started at the Mexican border and were hiking to the Canadian border.  I can only hope that they will write their memoirs that will prove to be way more interesting than Cheryl's.  Their stories of their adventures were fascinating.  So when \\"Wild came along I couldn't wait.<br /><br />What I read about was a self-absorbed, hedonistic woman who seemed to have the morals of an alley cat.  That's fine but frankly I just wasn't interested.  It started when  she was in her mom's hospital room, and  felt compelled to describe  the hospital attendant's penis through his sheer pants that he had on.  What value did sharing that have to do with the story?  Why would she think that that observation  would remotely be interesting  to the reader?<br />It seemed like every man she met, she would size them up as a potential sex partner.  Taking a package of condoms on her journey would seem to support that contention.<br />And then when she got to Ashland, we all knew what was going to happen there.  And once again did anyone really care?<br />What unfolds is a story about a woman who has made so many bad decisions in her life prior to hiking the trail and continues while on her journey.  Like others, I was way more interested in her hiking the trail.  I could even put up with pages and pages of complaints about her sore feet and losing her toenails if there had been more depth to the  story.<br /><br />One can only wonder, when her kids read the book, what they might think.  I wan't impressed.
B00170F0WU|4.0|I love Jean Reno and found this to be a good story line.  The age difference was a little disturbing but coupled with the Matilda's home life it was understandable.  Lots of violence but a satisfying and realistic ending.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Thought it was funny, very creative on the part of the writer, thought provoking, it did have a moral, not too violent!  Only ONE death in the whole movie, that has to be a record.
1591844096|5.0|The main theme of the book is about how to be creative and differentiate yourself.<br /><br />The information is very good, but would take a long time to really adopt and apply.<br /><br />Do you have an extra hour every day to brainstorm, write down ideas, read more, ask questions and practice being creative?  I don't... but I don't doubt that it would help me if I could.<br /><br />However, I wouldn't hold that against the author.  Changing your work life and positioning yourself to be indispensable does not happen overnight.
B000OLROWC|5.0|THE KARATE KID<br /><br />I REALLY LIKE THE 1984 MOVIE KARATE KID WITH RALPH MACCHIO. IT IS A GOOD STORY. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE PART IN THE MOVIE KARATE KID WHEN THEY CELEBRATE HIS BIRTHDAY WITH BIRTHDAY CAKE AND A PRESENT. I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD WHEN IT CAME OUT IN THEATRE'S. IT IS DEFINENTLY MY FAVORITE MOVIE.<br /><br />ADRIAN E. BLANCHARD
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I thought it was really good, they definitely took some liberties with the villain Bane in the movie vs. the comic book but that did not stop me from enjoying the overall experience.  If you are a militant comic book purist, you may find yourself a bit disappointed but the rest of us that like a quality plot, decent acting, and lot's of action will enjoy this
B00CH87HF4|5.0|AWESOME game a must have if u love hack n' slash. Easy to use and easily addictive. I've been playing this game for a couple of days and I just can't put it down. Looking forward for the next AWESOME game you guys come out with.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Enjoyed it. It was as exciting as the first season and plenty of action. Watch each episode back to back.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|We did not plan to watch the whole thing in one sitting and neither of us got up! We had both read the book and felt it carried the themes well.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The initial season was great television. It kept my interest from episode to episode.I am looking forward to watching the next season.
B002ZG974M|2.0|We watched the trailer and thought we would appreciate it. We wanted to fast-forward most of it and couldn't wait for it to end. Waited for it to get better but it never did, not until about 79 minutes later.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I first saw this on Netflix and loved it so much I had to order the DVD. Can't say I'm much impressed with the &#34;special edition&#34; aspect of this -- but the film itself is amazing.
1589944607|5.0|This game is fun. It has a great dynamic where everyone accuses everyone of being a cylon traitor. If you're not doing this, you're doing it wrong. It does have moderately complicated rules, so be prepared to consult the rule book often if most players are new player. It runs very quick and smoothly if you have at least one experienced player on board.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|All of these Outlander books are AWESOME!  I love the concept and I love our country's history presented in such an intimate manner.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Seems like the really good shows come from the cable and satellite networks and &#34;Suits&#34; is a good example of that.  It's a funny and smart program that uses clever plots to attract an audience instead of resorting to coarse language or extreme sexual situations.  Just an overall good show.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Not super informative if you've read Michael Pollan or similar material but for those clueless about our food industry, VERY eye opening and upsetting. Hopefully can motivate change and we can all start buying locally and ethically and voting with our dollars.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We had been looking for this for years after seeing it on Masterpiece Theatre, if I remember correctly. We had decided that it was one of those movies tied up in legal disputes. Imagine our delight in finding it and enjoying it as much as we remembered.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Had missed all of season 3 - great as the first two seasons!  Would recommend to all.  Looking forward to Season 4
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Well done. Funny entertainment with science and sci-fi interwoven into the story lines.  Many geek flavored references here.  Not for younger audiences imo due to many sexual references unfortunately.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This is a long movie with excellent acting by excellent actors.<br />I definitely recommend it to everyone who likes history movies or Kevin Costner.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|I went from not knowing who they were, to watching every single one of their youtube videos, to buying the album in a week.  No regrets.  I've been listening to it non-stop since I got it.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Another Clint Eastwood movie from days gone by.<br />This is a great spaghetti movie and with great actors.<br />Good stay at home movie to watch.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so looking forward to an ending to the Crossfire story.  You know, the happy ending and all.  I thought I was going to get it.  WRONG!!!!!!  Now I have to wait heaven knows how long and how much more I have to spend.  I debated purchasing this volume and finally gave in.  I should have just given up.  The end to this story was very disappointing.  It didn't really end.  It just faded.  This may be the end for me.
B001EYK52O|5.0|This is a very good movie with Steve McQueen giving a great performance.<br />Anyone who likes &#34;BULLITT&#34; will also like this movie.<br />Definitely a great movie and I loved it and so will you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not one to spend time with drama series, but I was hooked on episode 1 of season 1 and have watched every episode from season 1 to season 3. Can't wait to see what season 4 will bring. The interaction between all of the characters is superb, the story line is excellent. You will get hooked on this series for sure.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I love this show... hbo does a great job. Also with great<br /> writers and actors. I love Boardwalk Empire and True Blood .
B0065GC0PG|3.0|Alright let's get started. Cinder is an awesome re-envisioning of the original fairy tale! I've got to give Marissa credit for that. I mean ... Cinder as a cyborg? I don't think anyone has tried that before. It's new and refreshing and it is what made me want to read this book in the first place.<br /><br />So Lihn Cinder is a Cyborg - meaning she has mechanical protheses and organs attached to herself. She's a mechanic in New Beijing, which lies in the Eastern Commonwealth. And the entire world is ravaged by plague outbreaks, for which no one knows the cure. Sounds a nice place to live don't you think? Moving on, alright so one day Prince Kai shows up at her workplace on the market, giving her an android she needs to fix. It's really obvious that Cinder likes him even though she tries to deny it quite a few times throughout the book. After that it's a whirlwind of problems for Cinder. Including the fact that she has secrets she didn't even know about and that make her a target of Queen Levana.<br /><br />So all in all I liked this book, despite the fact that it's a bit predictable after 60 or so pages. But I think there are a lot of people who would love this book. So that actually explains the 3,5 stars I am giving it.<br /><br />It's good but not fantastic.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Somehow I couldn't put this book down, but it made me feel like I needed a shower every time I'd finished a chapter.  I couldn't stand the characters--either one of them.  I didn't feel any empathy at any point.  If that was the goal of the book, well, it was well met.
B006S01GH2|5.0|A touching look at a different way of seeing/living the world.  A great movie to watch with close friends and mature children.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|My kids giggle at the Dwarf antics in this show.  I didn't like it myself as a youth, but I love it now as a mom.
B006S01GH2|1.0|We watched this for about 8-10 minutes, and then gave up and went to an old masterpiece theater episode.  Can't recommend for any audience.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|We love this movie.  It is a bit non-traditional for Disney, but we quote this movie all the time - cheese me no-likey!
0670023329|5.0|This is somewhat hard to read... mostly because when you read it you know in your gut that its a true story but at the same time how can someone of a similar age have led that life?  It hurts to read this through sheer helplessness - this is not a historical account but someething that happened - is happening in our life time which I find hard to comprehend.<br /><br />This is a must read story, just try to remember while your snuggled on your sofa or in your bed, in your comfy clothes and air conditioning, that at least you are opening your eyes to what is going on in North Korea and try not to feel too guilty.
B001AZFO14|5.0|to judge how good an actor is when they have plenty of dialog and a good script.  Kurt Russell proved he is an excellent actor even when given precious little dialog and a good script.  His eyes and facial expression perfectly tell the story of Todd-a used and abused throw away soldier disposed of like so much garbage once he was no longer valued.  This movie never received the kudos it so richly deserved.  Poor marketing, not enough advertising when it was out at the theaters-who knows?  I rented the dvd because I like Kurt Russell and the bit of information on the back of the package looked interesting enough to while away a Sunday afternoon.  I watched it-turned off the tv and went to the store and bought a copy of the dvd.  That doesn't happen all that often.  Give this one a watch-pay attention to Kurt and I think you will understand exactly what I mean.  This movie gets 5 stars because it deserves them.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|So because I had to reset my kindle I had to re-download this app. Now that I've done that, after a couple mins. it'll stop loading recent tweets and it worked completely fine before. Hopefully this can get fixed.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app.  It is easy to use on my phone and Kindle.  I haven't even bothered to put it on my laptop YET.  There are so many choices....some i never even knew existed...History?  are you kidding?  nothing but interviews?  What a great idea to share in my classroom!  The uses for this app are endless.  Entertainment, enjoyment and knowledge!  WOW.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|The chapters are so well described it's easy to picture each scene in your mind!  A very exciting conclusion.<br />Highly recommended.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Based on reviews, experience and the first pages, I was sure I was gonna like this small wonderful book, but certainly not as much as I ended loving it. I've read many other NG books and liked them a lot, especially American Gods, but I had never read books by him of this genre. Simply perfect prose, characters that seem to appear before you, bitter-sweet and sometimes terrible images and metaphors that linger seemingly  forever... Please read it, but do it with an open mind so you won't be put off by some perhaps too dark episodes. If you know NG I am sure you'll appreciate those episodes in themselves, but also as part of a complex and moving (it really moved me to tears) masterpiece of fantasy and of rites of passage.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Easy & fast way to check on current weather or future weather. Good weather info can be very important for day planning.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is perfect reading for those scientifically educated people who; like me, search constantly for justification for our childlike faith in an ever increasingly militant secular world.  Reading Dr. Alexander's experience caused me to feel emboldened and compelled to remind my highly educated friends that the more we learn, the wise person realizes how little we \\"know\\".
B0091LS07E|3.0|This is not the best piece of work.  I love Alicia's work but only find one good song on this album.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is a very intense love story with some unexpected turns in the story.  I find myself rooting for their relationship when they are separated.  It's a great read.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I enjoy every song and I didn't realize how many hits were contained within.  Great walking CD and fabulous group
0262731541|5.0|If you like bikes, REALLY like bikes, this belongs on your shelf.<br />This is a serious scientific investigation of bikes, how they work, and the limits of their operation.<br />I have never seen so much data about bikes and how they can be ridden assembled in one place.<br />The theory and engineering of sub-assemblies is discussed, but this is NOT a book on bike repair.<br />If you like working on bikes, this will explain WHY you do what you do to keep them running well.<br />Right next to this book on my shelf is 'Bicycles and Tricycles' by Archbald Sharp, written 108 years before 'Bicycle Science'.<br />Amazing: the more things change, the more they stay the same.<br />Bike geeks: get both and enjoy!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This is an incredible, intelligent, brutally honest book that addressed race relations, human prejudism and human interaction in different societies.  A book about true love. Thank you for writing this book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Amazing game. Great mix of hard but tolerable waves make this game addicting. I haven't paid a cent on glu credits and am on wave 91. The only problems are occasional freezes and rare times where it crashes. But definitely worth the download.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Really good hidden treasure game for the game. Enjoyed playing on my train commute. Puzzles are challenging without being overly hard. Great time burner.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I knew there would always be a degree of error involved...as with any device...but I have found it minimal. I forget its even there but feel really great when I check it to see what I have done for the day...and it makes me want to do more...to reach the next milestone. I use the pulse, the body analyzer scale and myfitpal. The combination tells me everything I need and want to know. The set up was soooo easy...it syncs in seconds. The pulse reader is spot on...however you need to touch your finger 'lightly' as it says or it will have issues....but it has been spot on for me every time. (I was taking it manually to test). The battery life is as described....long. Overall I am very pleased. The new healthmate website is great too. ( I saw the old interface...not so hot) the new one has everything in one place. Very happy!
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Nice to show the rest of the world what us musicians go through to create a recording. But you can tell that it's directed by a musician; Ghrol is a better drummer than director. A bit clunky and cliche but entertaining.
B00607EWYC|2.0|I found the book very hard to read. The switches between third and first person were difficult to follow; I wasn't sure who the speaker was. The writing is well done but that did not redeem this book for me. I had to go to a review site to get a real handle on what the story was about and that is not a usual experience for me.
B001LIBRL6|5.0|Love it. Classic Woody. Feels like one he directed as well. Might as well be since he wrote it. The only way you can tell is by the use of music.
B00E193TM2|2.0|First one by FFDP is a classic! Second one solid for sure. Third one is OK but not as raw and brutal as I like. The new one, thank goodness I only paid $6.99 for the mp3, is total commercial and made for mainstream radio play. Don't get me wrong, it's still FFDP but for my tastes it's a major dissapointment!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|Jim Carrey did a wonderful job in this moive. A great buy and would tell any or every one to buy as so as possible.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I have been an Avengers fan for as long as I can remember and it is great that they put this movie together and tied it in to the previous individual marvel movies. Very nice!!!
B003UYUQZW|3.0|Just another Disney moive to add to the collection. I need to gett more but they are just to pricey at the stores
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved the whole story of a woman hitting rock bottom and finding her way back, especially without quite thinking the whole thing through.
B00DNO3JUI|2.0|Interesting but not a favorite.  The acting was superb however~!  The nudity was unnecessary.  Anna was amazing in this piece of work.
B00E5Q1HJS|3.0|Three stars is a good movie rating for me! Especially for a reboot; I almost gave it four because there were some twists that actually hadn't been spoiled and managed to catch me.<br /><br />I'd seen reviews of this movie when it came out asking if it was &#34;too dark&#34;. Hell no! It's far more &#34;realistic&#34;. This is a great ride, a fun ride and a surprising ride. The actors really pull it together and tell part of a greater story that still has a lot of pages left. I am hoping that the reboots are done and we can boldly go into that brave new Universe.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy. Suspend your disbelief and lock your inner Trekkie in the closet.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Loved the movie, great action, perfect effects, fantastic plot, new character, worth the price and time. I strongly recommend. 100%
B007N8RULO|4.0|I love spider solitaire and the game works great. I'd have given it 5 stars but the ads are too intrusive.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I loved it, but dont' try to watch it with your husband.  I can't imagine a straight guy ever sitting through more than 20 minutes.
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|Downloaded the video to TIVO and it basically lost 40 minutes out of the middle of the movie.  There is no option to get my money back.... #amazondownloadtotivofail
B00CPWTRAA|1.0|How many years of a great carreer has Domingo had? 30? 40? So, even if he hadn't had a carreer based on youth (such as the singer's one) even if he had been a civil servant, he would have gone into retirement by now. And here we are talking about a guy that has had a great carreer and made, justly, a fortune out of it. And what does he do? At the age of 70 he decides, after singing for many years past his prime and trying unsuccessfuly to conduct, to become a baritone. The question one has to consider is: How can a great artist be saved from ridicule? Surely, one does not have to die like Callas. One can always follow the example of the Great Tebaldi and RETIRE. Tebaldi retired at an age when still her voice was impressive and she never learnt even to spell the words \\"wobble\\" or \\"uncertain pitch\\". Here we deal with a case that is, quite frankly,if not ridiculous then terribly sad. Hear the \\"cortigiani...\\" for example. Hear it from Domingo, and then immediately play it with Gobbi, Milnes or ANY BARITONE. You will immediately know what I mean. This is not a baritone voice. This is a worn out dramatic tenor's voice. And I let aside the arias that are sung by a young hero. There the things are even worse because there is nothing youthful in Domingo's voice anymore. Well, there is not really much else to say. It happened to Luciano as well. It happened to Sutherland captured on film as a 60 year old Lucia (lol). And of course it happened to Caballe who at the age of 79 (!!!) was literally carried in front of a microphone at a concert in Athens only  to show  a speechless audience how an at one time great soprano could not hit ONE NOTE IN TUNE. Vanity? Avarice? I don't know...
0061150142|5.0|Again I must say I couldn't put the book down.  I was a little disappointed in the &#34;reality&#34; of the situation, but is it COULD happen that way, she again found many ways to dissect each character's feelings and thoughts  as each development occurred.<br />That is her power as a writer.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My daughter watches this movie on the iPad at least once a week! Great for road trips and who doesn't love a good Disney movie?
1476729719|5.0|My name is Lee Ann, not Rose as you stated.<br />Thisbook is as riveting as the last book I read by her.  I have only read about 5 chapters, but can't put the book down.<br />I keep writing down quotes that she writes - she has such a unique way of looking at things and people and happenings.<br />I need to go back and read some more instead of play on the computer.<br />Smile
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app has been the best thing to help my daughter fall asleep at night. There are so many sounds to choose from that she never has to be bored by just one.
B001AJ09JW|5.0|great movie and good cast. Love Desmond Harrington in it! one of his best movies from when he began acting.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Thor was exciting, had alot of action, great story line, kept you on the edge of your seat.<br />Loved it.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Going to see these folks in San Francisco this labor day.  The music is up tempo and full of energy.  I love the balance of voices and instruments.  I want to learn to play the Ukulele now.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|The hunger games were boring, not a lot of action, did not really like the story line, the ending just kind of left it hanging,not exciting at all.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I read the book and loved it. To be honest this is one of the best movies. So honest and im sure more of this happens in real life than most would think about. I will put this one in my Favs to keep watching.
B000VE439Y|5.0|The answer begins with &#34;The Aquaduct&#34; as all fans know. I saw this when it was originally released in the thatres more than 30 years ago. The religious satire is irreverent, to be sure, but not disrespectful. This has everything you can want in a Python gas. The production quality is better than the Holy Grail and I give it the nudge over the Grail in terms of pure laughs. It covers more territory and takes more risks than the retelling of the Arthur legend. Feel free to disagree. My 5 best scenes from Brian against your 5 from the Grail. I love the Grail but this is where I stand.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|But I like these kind of shows.Some people do not. it's predictable so I don't have to think..just watch it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Famous last words of the Black Knight guarding bridge over the creek. The best part of the DVD is the English subtitles. Having seen the flick repeatedly at dollar theatres, by turning on the English subtitles I was finally able to make out the lyrics to Knights of the Round table. It doesn't get any better for a Python fan, except maybe in Life of Brian. I know you hate me for saying such a thing, all of you Grailers.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Really two movies in one.  A history of sound city and a documentary about making the music for a new CD.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|If you like period drama, this is definitely one to watch.  I tried watching the original series and couldn't get past the 70's &#34;feel&#34;, this is lush, well acted, excellent camera work and well worth watching.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great in depth game with a lot of levels. Not so difficult that it's frustrating, but challenging enough to keep you entertained. Worth it!
B005544V6A|5.0|GREAT SHOW!!!  I have nothing bad to say about this show......excellent writing and excellent acting!  Can't wait to watch more seasons!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|the first thing that you need to know is that you don't need help support for whom any other streaming service as long as you can stream from their website you can use this product To stream through Google Chrome browser if you want HBO Go then go to this site if you want ABC streaming in go to the website. I had three of them right off the bat in one of them I could not get to work the other two would work so I finally figured out that the thing was defective so I returned it And got another 1 and it work flawlessly. trust me for people who know what this thing is and how it works you will love it
0385512058|3.0|I listen to a lot of audio books and downloaded this one without reading the \\"back cover\\". I was expecting a book by an established businessman who has mastered networking and then gone on to do research to prove his theories to be translated into a book. Instead I got this lazy thing which I would call more an autobiography than anything else. I say lazy because it is filled to the brim with self promotion and mainly stories from his own life without any research into the nuts and bolts of what constitutes networking. And anywhere from 50 to 100 pages of the book is filler type of babble about general business leadership stories and advice that is so common place that any business major could write it in college. Also, he places huge emphasis on how his father's audacity to network his son's way into prestigious schools all the way to Harvard MBA has had the biggest impact in his life. This left me hoping for advice for those of us who never went to Harvard who don't have that kind of established network behind us. That consideration never came.<br /><br />So why even 3 stars? The book is not completely useless as it does have a handful of nuggets of useful information or ideas such as the \\"networking action plan\\". Go ahead and pick this book up just don't expect too much. My standards for a great book are much higher.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|A great story to escape to. I'm still reading the other books in the series. One of those books you won't be able to put down.
B002I9Z89Y|4.0|With Vol#2 and Vol #3 I now have the Complet set,  It's great to have the all three Seasons. As. always Great Picture, and Sound......
B00B9366VO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  For any fans of rock history from fleetwood mac to nirvana  will get a kick out of this flick.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I wont give any of it away to anyone who has not read the books yet, but want to say thank you to Cassandra for not killing off my favorite characters. lol<br />May 2014 seems so far away for next book.<br />They need to have 2nd movie before then.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|The original movie not only had a plot that was interesting and surprising, as well as at least some basic comedy and action; it also had a point. It talked about a ditopia and imagined something unusual. This is little more than a hollywood re-digestion that results in no new thought, none of the original thought, and frankly not much fun when it comes to blow-it-up special effects and fight scenes.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am absolutely 100% addicted. Hands down in my opinion best books since Twilight series.<br />I am in love with all the characters. I just finished the 5th book and I'm dying because I now have to wait till May 2014 for book 6.<br />I have also seen the movie twice. Great writing.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|I love the Doctor Who reboot but the first season just pales in comparison to the latter ones. I generally like Christopher Eccleston, but as the Doctor he lacks the presence and intrigue brought forth by both David Tennant and Matt Smith. Despite my issues with Eccleston, this is a very important season as it sets up the stage for that which has yet to come (or that which has already occurred depending on how you perceive time). I may be a bit unfair with criticisms but regardless, the series only gets better!
B0090C0BNA|4.0|Bought this for my son. We like the headset. Its comfortable for him to wear. But sometimes it echos when he talks. Only occasionally.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|quality lyrics, quality vocals, quality vampire weekend. Every time i listen to the album, it gets better and better for me.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I know this series was written for a teen audience, but I found it very engaging.  I had a hard time putting the books down.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of my favorite shows!  It gets funnier every season!  The third season is no exception to this.  Great season!  It's always great to watch how some of the now-regular main characters were introduced!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is a book from 1978 from one of my favorite authors, Ken Follett. It was an enjoyable read and full of suspense. I loved it!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love the adventures of Indiana Jones.  It really nice to have, it is a treasure.  Good movies for the family
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I had a hard time getting into the book where as the series season 1 was good and we are hoping there will be a season 2.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|good game, rules aren't laid out clearly.  using the tilt to steer option is a bit nauseating, but at least there is another option.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loves how all the characters were intertwined in the stories - wasn't crazy about the ending though.<br />As with most new books I read it is like the author writes a great story, but when it comes to the end - like<br />they just rush to get it finished.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I needed to replace my USB cable for my kindle, and went with this one, made specifically for the kindle.  It did the trick, but like the original, and second, this is my third cable and has already shown stress in the neck of the cable, right after the connection to the kindle.  Trying to remedy this by not having the cord bent when in use, but sorta hard to convince everyone else to do this.
B003157DTM|4.0|I just got it for my daughter because her dad had one when he was little too. Keep up the good work....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Both myself and daughter enjoyed this game only wish there were more levels. Some of puzzles hard to work out but got there in the end.
0393327345|5.0|If you loved the movie, buy the book. Warning though, it is pretty short of a book. Shipped on time and came in great condition
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Hit Girl, a juvenile killing machine. Kick ass, a nerd. A villain left for the next movie.  Looking forward to Kick Ass 2.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a very long time. Colum McCann's prose is gorgeous, and his way of tying all the ends together is nothing short of miraculous. I will read and re-read this book.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This was a violent, action filled movie.  I was not sure if I would like it, but it held my interest.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Fantastic Series! Draws you in and doesn't let you go... You've just got to keep watching one episode after another!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I expected was very nice product, I am satisfied with the product, as they offer, pay the right price, I will continue watching deals, highly recommended!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love everything this show offers. I love the characters and their development. I will miss Ziva David terribly though.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Mad max is an awesome movie if you haven't seen it buy it now.  You wont regret it. :-D :D
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Simply amazing. I wasn't sure what to expect with this, at first with the whole 'someone misterious telling a story to some historian' thing made me feel like this was just a poor imitation of patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles but it wasn't. It was a brand new, origional, and really quite good piece of writing. I loved this book, it made you expect something and gave you something else even better, it built a character from start to finish that you learn to love, pitty, and respect and by the end all you want is to know more. This book kept me gripped start to finish and I can't wait to read the next one and find out where he's going with this!<br /><br />~once there were seven (remember that)~
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book with all its characters holding equal interest. I found myself unable to put it down. I loved the ending!  All the what ifs that are truly a part of everyone's life. I recommend this book highly.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Not really sure how much there is to say about this book. It's amazing. Patrick Rothfuss is a great author. The characters make you want to just jump into the book and hang out with them. It is a tale of epic preportions. All these things and more are what reviewers around the world are saying about his book and it is all true. If you have read the first book you should already know this and if you haven't... Well what the hell are you doing?? Go read it! NAO! Really though this is a sequal on par with the amazing things his first book has lead us to expect. Patrick Rothfuss has continued his amazing ability to create gold out of ink and paper and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Clint Eastwood shows you he is not just stuck on being a Dirty Harry character, he shows just how much depth he has in this one.
B005IDXIL2|1.0|Even though this was free, I would not recommend it to anyone.  I downloaded it, and every time I tried to bowl, the ball went totally the wrong way, and the pins are so far down the alley you cannot aim right anyway.
B001TODCII|3.0|Good story line, and some pretty good acting by Liam. Lots of action and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat until the story plays out. The way the story ended made you think there was a 2 coming and sure enough there is one out there. I have not seen it yet, I guess I am going to do that.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My daughter loved this game. She could play it for hours if I let her. Too easy and boring for myself though.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun to see who can get better score. I play against my friends and husband all the time. Simple and easy to play.  Keeps me engaged.
B005544V6A|4.0|great evening show, not breaking bad but funny smart and enjoyable. Good acting and interesting characters in a cynical surrounding, try it you won't be dissapointed
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its like games like subway surfers and temple run 1 and 2. the thing is that you get to battle characters from despicable me. its an amazing app.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|we love this series..cannot wait for season 4 to be released. Def did not see some of the turns and twists in the plot
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|A Story about love and all it's many forms. The actors in the film were well chosen. For a chick flick it turned out to be pretty awesome.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have been using it for the last few months and really like the Chromecast.  I have lost connection once or twice but otherwise works as promised.  Needs more functionality, but for $35 it is pretty awesome.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The second season does not disappoint, you are introduced to new characters and learn new things about the old ones. I like the writing and that there are a lot of episodes.
B00004YA66|5.0|This was a wonderful heartwarming movie that brought the tears.  Of course I am a boo baby.  Hope others view it as I did
B0091X2K0A|5.0|I've watched this movie probably five times or more, it's always so good that I watch to the end.<br />Well written, produced, filmed and acted.  All the elements are there.<br />Yes, it's violent, but it's about soldiers and war, so there you have it.<br />Saving Private Ryan is a  better movie if you like war, and prefer it a little less bizarre.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|I really enjoy the more aggressive stance they took on this album. It's not as laid back as some of their earlier works.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|I can not understand some of the negative reviews for Dr. Panda,s Airport.<br />I have had NO NAGS FOR REVIEWS.<br />I have NOT BEEN DIRECTED TO JAPANESE YOU-TUBE.<br />You do not need to be connected to a network to play this game.<br /><br />I currently have 9 of the Dr. Panda games. I think that Dr. Panda games are among the best, if not the best, of this type. Dr. Panda games are the favorite with 4yr. old kids who use my tablet. The Dr. Panda games are highly entertaining and usually interactive. These games also have educational value for children. I have NOT had a problem with nags or redirects in any of the Dr. Panda games.<br /><br />Thank You Amazon for making this game available for free today as the FAOTD! This was quite a pleasant surprise, which made me happy. I almost purchased this game yesterday (In which case, I would not have been happy to find it free today).<br /><br />The opening screen of Dr. Panda has a button labelled: \\"For parents\\". The opening screen also has a link to \\"More games!\\" (THIS BUTTON CAN BE EASILY DISABLED). Tapping either of the above buttons, first takes you to a screen where you have to tap multiple (2 to 5) times to proceed. All of the screens in Dr. Panda have the same music.<br /><br />The \\"More games!\\" button gives you a screen with internet links to the other Dr. Panda games, as well as the option to subscribe to a newsletter. The \\"More games!\\" button is easily disabled by going into the \\"For parents\\" section and turning off the \\"Show promotion screen\\" option. That's it. After doing this, the opening screen will only have the option to start the game or go into the \\"For parents\\" section.<br /><br />Now for the bad stuff:<br />If you go into the section clearly labelled \\"For parents\\" and tap the button to \\"Review us\\", you will be nagged for a review.<br />If you go into the section clearly labelled \\"For parents\\" and tap the button to \\"subscribe\\" to the newsletter, you will have subscribed.<br />If you go into the sectionclearly labelled \\"For parents\\" and tap the button to \\"Like\\" on Facebook, you will be bothered by Facebook.<br />If you go into the section clearly labelled \\"For parents\\" and keep the option to \\"Show promotion screen\\", your children can access the \\"More games!\\" area (with internet links).<br />I haven,t read it (yet), but the icon to enter the game is an airplane outline (Go figure!). I,m sure some parent will say that this encourages his/her child to play with the airplane icon in network \\"settings\\".<br />Dr. Panda's Hospital has the panda as a doctor, not Dr. Panda's Airport. It appears as if this game is airport themed.<br /><br />As others have noted, Dr. Panda's Airport seems to be more advanced than other Dr. Panda games. I think that this game goes at a slower pace than the other Dr. Panda games. I think that this is a good thing, as it can help children cope with all the waiting in airports nowadays (You will never see a scene like in the older movies where you can get out of the taxi 3 minutes before your flight and run through the airport, past security, carrying an armful of luggage, unto your plane. Did I forget to mention that since it is winter, you don't take off your ski mask until you are comfortably in your seat on the plane.).<br /><br />This game can help children become acquainted with airport check-in procedures. This includes security screening. Some people might be upset at the items shown (people do shave with something you know), but this is nothing compared to what can be seen in the dump bins at actual airports. I guess you will just have to make sure that your children never see what is actually confiscated. I was surprised by the bottle opener and the analog watch (I worked at a school that had an analog clock in every room, yet the people were asking me what the time was, as they could not read an analog clock). I'm sure some parents will have to explain to their children about bottle openers (It's not for soda pop).<br /><br />This game is not for \\"tapaholic\\" children. You have to think about what you are doing. This is not a difficult game, but frantic tapping will not get you through this game. As I mentioned previously, I think that this is better for children in waiting lines and waiting areas. This game will also help children behave in a more patient manner. If you are blessed with hyper-active children and think that everyone around you should share in the joy of your hyper-active children, this game is probably not for you (unless you want your phone used as a hockey puck).<br /><br />I think that Dr. Panda's Airport is a very good game to help children become familiar with airports.<br />And again:<br />Thank You Amazon for making this the FAOTD.<br /><br />Edited: 8/29/2013<br />Corrected a few typos and changed \\"pop\\" to \\"soda pop\\".
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Loved this movie!  So awesome I'm sorry I didn't see this on the big screen!  Love Love Loved it!! AMAZING!
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|If you have time to waste take this one for a spin. If you have things to do or have other movies in your que, skip it.
B007PJFFWC|5.0|This may be the only movie that I can watch over and over again, and it actually gets better each time I watch it. I'm not going to give this big lengthy review going through the visuals and acting and stuff. I'm just going to say that this is my favorite movie of all time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome app. If you like to create and design buildings,<br />then this is the game for you. Great game. Mojang did a wonderful job. Keep it up.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I loved this movie from the 1st time I saw it. Mind-blowing!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This movie was stolen from me...  I had to buy it again!!!
B0060D08JO|5.0|I've watched this movie probably 5 times in the last year alone.  I love the graphics, story line, pretty much everything about this movie.  If you love sci fi action movie this is one to check out.
1401217109|3.0|I love the League.  I love looking up the references.  So much here it is a little overwhelming and a little much
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It is an excellent pdf reader that works and it has name recognition.  I have a lot of pdf files on my device and this just simply does the trick.
0525478817|5.0|I literally (yes, literally) just finished reading this book and I want to write my review while the emotions are still raw. One of the most amazing talents of authors is their ability to make the reader care about characters who do not exist. John Green's brings to life Hazel and Augustus in such a way that a visceral reaction to the story is impossible.<br /><br />Any good review should (I suppose) contain a critique or two. The only one to be made is that the plot turns out to be predictable, but really a story as touching and beautiful as this only has one path to follow.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. Thank you John Green for writing this story (and for making me cry in public).
B00280LYIM|4.0|I rather enjoyed this book in the series. It was a very good installment and left me wanting to read the next book asap.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I have been to Australia at least 5 times when my sister lived there so I especially loved this movie - it didn't disappoint me.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This series is a nice quick read (for adults) that really does a nice job of getting the reader interested. I enjoy that the main character's emotions are believable for someone his age.
B009R659L8|5.0|I really like Mary Higgins Clark books, and this one did not disappoint.  She has great characters in this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Who doesn't love pinterest? It's the best way to keep track of all the things you love in one organized place!
B0000AK7AC|5.0|I bought this movie for my family and my kids loved it. Then I bough it for my parents, as they love animals and I thought they would enjoy it. They did! Great family movie.
B00280LYHS|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the Percy Jackson series so far, and this is another good installment. Lovely series that is of consistent quality.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty cool app. My kids &amp; I enjoy solving it together. I would definitely recommend this app to friends
B00AE2KZNQ|4.0|I love a good period drama and this was apparently based on actual events. I felt the casting worked well and the chemistry between the characters added to the movie. If you like period pieces with a historical context, then this will be a good movie to watch.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|UNLESS YOU CONTINUOUSLY READ THROUGH THESE BOOKS, IT'S DIFFICULT TO RECALL THE CAST OF CHARACTERS.  FOR ME, AT LEAST.  GREAT STORY, HOWEVER, AND I'M SURE I'LL TRY AGAIN TO GET THROUGH IT.  I'LL HAVE TO START AT THE BEGINNING BUT IT GRABS YOUR INTEREST SO IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT - EXCEPT FOR THE TIME YOU MUST INVEST IN IT.  I'M NOT ONE TO WANT TO VIEW A BOOK THAT'S BEEN ADAPTED INTO A MOVIE OR TV SHOW.  IT SEEMS TO TAKE AWAY A LOT FOR ME.  I DON'T HAVE TO RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE - IT'S VERY, VERY POPULAR.  AS IS THE TV SERIES.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy is absolutely the BEST books I have ever read, and I am an avid reader and have been my whole life.  I have already read the trilogy twice and it won't be the last.
0307476073|5.0|I WANTED TO READ THIS BOOK AGAIN....IMMEDIATELY AFTER I FINISHED IT.  I SIMPLY ADORE THIS BOOK...EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.  THE MESSAGES AND MEANINGS.  GOSH, I WISH I WAS AS BRAVE AS CHERYL.  I WISH I WAS YOUNG ENOUGH TO PLAN A HIKE LIKE THIS.  THIS IS JUST A GREAT STORY TOLD BY A VERY GOOD WRITER, AT THAT.  I'M GOING TO SEEK OUT HER OTHER BOOKS, AS WELL.  GOOD FOR YOU, CHERYL.  YOU'RE ONE TOUGH CHICK, CHERYL,  AND ALL WHO READ THE ACCOUNT OF YOUR LIFE WILL CERTAINLY ADMIRE YOU.  I'M GOING TO READ THE BOOK AGAIN SOON(!)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As I said previously about Book Two, the trilogy was the best books I have ever read.  I have already read the trilogy twice and will be reading it again.
0823015017|4.0|WELL, THE BOOK REALLY DOESN'T ENTIRELY TELL YOU ALL THE SECRETS.  BUT, THERE'S ENOUGH IN IT TO CARRY YOU FAR IF YOUR CRAFT IS POLYMER CLAY.  FOR THE ARTIST, LINDLY, THIS ISN'T JUST A CRAFT - NOT A HOBBY - SHE'S WAY BEYOND THAT.  A TRUE ARTIST IN EVERY SENSE.  UNFORTUNATELY, HER ARTISTRY DIDN'T BECOME MINE.  GUESS YOU HAVE TO BE BORN WITH IT!
B003B02PEU|2.0|What is the purpose of following this one person?  More of the legal process might make it more worthy of a read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Amazing show. I'm glad I purchased Amazon Prime -- this show made it worth it by itself.<br /><br />The show always has something intense going on and the battle of &#34;wits&#34; in this show is better than any other show's I've ever seen. The chemistry between the characters are excellent and it is just very entertaining to watch all around!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Overall really good but of you have phone problems you can lose items bit I haven't contacted amazon as yet to straighten it out,also this only occurred when my SIM card had to be changed
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I liked playing it for a while, but to really enjoy the game you have to buy all this extra stuff...that kind of kills it for me
B001JNNDEW|5.0|I love this one, too.  Especially in Blu Ray.<br />I had it on VHS, but I wanted it in Blu Ray.  It was wonderful to watch.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Angry birds was ok before... making it star wars just made it so much better. I thought the game was well designed and enjoyable
1442346949|4.0|I bought the audio book version for utilizing my long commute time over the summer. Stories have been fascinating and I wish I read it earlier.
0425266060|5.0|Crossfire is the best series I`ve read so far. I love Gideon and Eva and their story. Everything about the Crossfire is just GREAT!!! LOVE IT:)
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|i won tickets to the world premiere of the movie in hollywood, just from the trailer alone i knew it was going to be scary but that was nothing compared to when i went to see the movie. it was the scariest movie i've seen in years since IT, horror movies haven't scared me at all till this.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Wish I could've given it \\"0\\" stars! It crashes & makes my son's Kindle lock up & require a restart every single time he tries to use it! Total disappointment!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Although short in length, this game is really fun, gets your brain moving! I hope they come out with more &quot;rooms&quot;.<br /><br />Plus, 99 cents is a steal.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|A really fun game..its easy to learn and the controls are great! Great game for kids and adults to play. Check it out :)
B000AJIF4E|2.0|Most of the positive stuff about the headphones has already been covered in the other reviews so I'm going to give you the bad. First of the long cord can be extremely difficult and annoying to handle walking around or simply laying around. Also it is not aesthetically pleasing.<br /><br />Second thing is the big one for me. The top of the cord that is located on the left headphone makes an annoying &#34;clack&#34; sound when it brushes up against the headphone. I get pissed off every time I put them on. Hell, I've even tried to stand still so it doesn't make a sound yet most of the time it is no use.<br /><br />You can get better headphones for a lower cost. I can't believe the other reviews were so positive on these. Spare yourself the trouble.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Was the worst app ever wouldnt even log in dont buy dont buy worst app ever in the world dont listen to the others dont buy
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Simply and beautifully written. Love how the author incorporated various characters perspectives on the same subjects and events. A true gift to the reader. One I wish everyone could receive and absorb.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Awesomeeeeeee!!!!!! It is the like the best book I have ever read!!! Like ever! It was an amazing book and a really good read!!!!!
B00EOO55GW|1.0|The songs on this album sound like a rip off of Metallica, except not nearly as good. The lyrics have no merit and the vocals fall flat. M. Shadows has a great voice but you can't tell by listening to this album. I love Avenged Sevenfold, I loved all of their previous albums and I tried very hard to love this one as well. It's just no good. One thing I will say though: I was impressed by the new drummer, he's not bad at all.
0062073192|5.0|I bought this book thinking it would be different than what it turned out to be, but it really is a great book. A very great way of figuring out all the happened in the series that you don't actually get to see, like all the stuff from when Sammy and Dean where kids.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is 1920, and the gripping story of the Crawley family continues.  Experiencing the joys and sorrows of the characters will make you feel as though you are right there in Downton Abbey with them.  Julian Fellowes has created entertainment for us which, in my opinion, surpasses most anything I've seen.
0316017930|5.0|Is Bill Gates who he is today because of the talent he has? Was Steve Jobs such a legendary creator because of his own persistence and visions? That's a good question that Malcolm Gladwell tries to explain in this book based on the opportunities and heritage they had in life. I have a little different opinion or maybe just an addition to his opinion what I think is very important as well!<br /><br />Outliers is the book about success. It's not another success story or a guide how to become successful, even though, after reading such book you can know more about success than you did before. It's a book with a lot of examples and experiments that were carried out trying to identify why some people are successful and some are not. Author tries to go deep into the surroundings that famous and successful people like Bill Gates, The Beatles, Joe Flom and others had in life. Malcolm makes an assumption that no one became successful by themselves, that the heritage and the society made those people into success stories they are. The book is full of experiments and explorations deep into those people lives, which sometimes take many generations before they were born. Author also gives us many statistics, to illustrate some of the facts about successful and not so successful people.<br /><br />What is more different in this book, that everything is explained based on the sequence of lucky opportunities that happened to those famous people. It's like, because of that it happened this and because of this there was a good time or personal character to do something. And like I mentioned before, sometimes it goes deep into many generations before. It might be true and I can't say contrary. Anyway, author agrees that to be successful you have to have certain character features and certain time to use opportunity. That's absolutely true. It's like starting to make a wagon for horse these days is absolute insanity when we are talking about the future of flying cars. But some time ago it was a chance. The same with character, of course you need to have certain features to become successful and author mostly says about why some people have one and other people have other features based on their background and life style. And the conclusion comes that some of them become successful and some don't.<br /><br />Everything there is true and I believe that couple hundred years ago not everybody had so much chances to become successful as we have now. Today really everything is possible and it doesn't depend on any character or background in the end. Yes, it depends at the start point, but the beauty of this is that we can change habits and character, because we have the information that it's possible and moreover we have methods and practices how to do so. It's possible to forgive person when he doesn't know something but it's not fair to do so when he knows the information but doesn't use it. And it's a choice to use or not, but the fact that we have it still remains. So every choice has a consequences and that's also known!<br /><br />Another ingredient to success story in Malcolm's book is opportunity. He talks about the opportunities that those successful people had. He admits that they were ready when the opportunity came, because they made right actions before. I agree one hundred percent with him too - you have to be ready to take an opportunity when it comes to you. And again, the beautiful thing in today world is that opportunities come very often. The problem is that most people don't see them because they are not ready or are too busy with their day-to-day routine. And to be ready is a choice of how you spend you time. Everyone has 24 hours a day, so it's just a choice what will you do during that time. Moreover, today it's possible to take or create an opportunity yourself as information is very easy accessible and everybody knows it!<br /><br />Considering everything that was said, it's a great book, which will help you to see success stories from a different angle. I believe it will help you to see what choices and surrounding can help you reach your goals and which won't. And as I mentioned before, the beautiful thing is that you can change and adapt yourself to become who you really want to be!<br /><br />So what is stopping you from success? Do you see many opportunities in life? Does your character help you?ies from a different angle. I believe it will help you to see what choices and surrounding can help you reach your goals and which won't. And as I mentioned before, the beautiful thing is that you can change and adapt yourself to become who you really want to be!<br /><br />So what is stopping you from success? Do you see many opportunities in life? Does your character help you?
B0063M22QO|4.0|Its a fun game that keeps me thinking. For the money it has my vote. I also think its good to help the eye brain coordination.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I had never heard of Bonamassa, until I saw him on a PBS fundraising show.<br /><br />I loved this artist's range and talent.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|It is a awesome game but I don't know how to get it on the amazon because it is not showing up yet.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|If you own an Infiniti and have the issue where your iPod will not charge from the standard iPod cable (I believe this problem exists in 2007-2010 models with iPod cables), this solves your problem in a heartbeat.  This device uses a separate micro-USB adaptor plugged into the cigarette lighter plug to supply separate power to charge the iPod.  Problem completely solved.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I like it because they brought back all the old school action stars I grew up with, only 2 people that they are missing is charles Bronson and Steven siegal hope they are in 3
B0064W667Y|1.0|The writing is dreadful and full of cliches and bad exposition. The writer should be flogged.  Was like a weak episode of Murder She Wrote.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is holding my interest. Hard to put down can not to pick it up again.I would reccomend it.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I really like this game.  It's cute, entertaining and really uses your mind.  I recommend this to anyone who would like to just kick back and have some fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very fun mostly because I am a fan of RPG games, and this is a good one with a few exceptions of course. Otherwise great game.
034580404X|5.0|Bought these books a long time ago and they are still great. Have read them over 4 times now. They are in excellent condition and when I received them they were in great condition. Also, got here super fast.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great I have so much fun playing it and its free I think everybody should get this game.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|Having watched the documentary &#34;Pacific&#34; we learned about Eugene Sledge. In this magnificent book, E.B. Sledge takes you there, with his fears, doubts, and personal observations. I only wish I could have met Mr. Sledge. He was a true citizen Marine.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|David Tennant is so good as the Doctor!  He is my favorite one. The DVD displays just an over view how good an actor he is.
0425263924|2.0|Like others I pre-ordered the book because I could not wait to read it. The story was too short and only sets readers up to purchase more books. I will need to finish the series, however I won't be in a rush to pre-order or purchase a new book.  I may have to see if it is available in the public library. I was very disappointed.

B000002L99|5.0|This outstanding album was the debut of Sammy Hagar as lead singer of Van Halen.  Made in 1986, this was a big departure of the style of music Van Halen made with David Lee Roth.  More keyboards overall, and more intense Rock and Roll.  However, at the same time some of the songs on 5150 are mellower than Van Halen's previous works.  The classic songs on 5150 are:<br /><br />1. Good Enough<br />2. Why Can't This Be Love<br />3. Get Up<br />4. Dreams<br />5. Summer Nights<br />6. Best Of Both Worlds<br />7. Love Walks In<br />8. '5150'<br />9. Inside<br /><br />The first single to be released was \\"Love Walks In\\" and to this day, Sammy Hagar says this is his favorite from his Van Halen days.  It was when the band first recorded with Sammy and Mr. Hagar still thinks fondly of the song.  All these songs are classic and the best of them are \\"Dreams\\" (the video with the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels is awesome!), \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\", and \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\".  This is one of Van Halen's best albums overall and is a classic in the history of the band and of Rock!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The actual functioning of the Google Chromecast is wonderful. I had it hooked up and running in less than 10 minutes. What it does, it does really, really, really well.<br /><br />I'm using a Windows 8 laptop. You have to install an update to Google's Chrome browser, and then use that for accessing web content. When you want to &#34;Chromecast&#34; you just click on the &#34;Chromecast&#34; icon and voila! Whatever you see in your browser you'll see on the screen. Almost everything. Almost. I was able to stream free programming from Hulu (not Hulu Plus), and general web browsing from static pages, to Google Maps or Earth (including street view) all worked great. There is some obvious lag from what you do on your laptop to what you see on the screen so you probably can't use this with your TV as an extra monitor. One negative feature was that though I could see Amazon Prime video on my laptop the Chromecast unit wouldn't show the video on the TV screen.<br /><br />I have an android tablet with Jelly Bean (ver. 4.3) and found the Chromecast experience to be a lot less seamless and a lot more annoying. Basically, you can ONLY use your Chromecast with Youtube, Netflix, and Google Play. A single app is an umbrella interface for three separate apps for accessing those three services. And, currently, no others. Worse, when I tried to play free content from Google Play, I couldn't do that without supplying a credit card number. Yes, you can't see free content unless you register a credit card and that annoyed me.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the Chromecast dongle are top-notch. I'm waiting for the open-source community to come up with work arounds that will eventually allow me to watch anything I can stream on my device through the Chromecast to my TV.<br /><br />A very neat, intriguing product. And annoying. One star off just for that.

B00EE3FVSU|4.0|It is good so far. The actors are good and the mystery is intriguing. I have not solved the mystery yet. I'll consider a fifth star at the end if the solution is well supported by the clues present throughout. Everything should be done for reasons that becomes evident at the end.
B007AL48UK|1.0|Game play is reasonable.  The major problem with this game is that it doesn't save your place.  I started a game, came back later, and instead of picking up where I left off, it generated a new game.  This one failing is the difference between this being a highly rated version of Mahjong and an awful version.

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners by Author Christoph Fischer<br /><br />Immediately after reading the book description of this fictional novel, I very much wanted to read the book in its entirety. I realize that \\"The Luck of the Weissensteiners\\" by talented Author Christoph Fischer is classified as a fictional novel but words can barely describe how much more it is than that...his style of writing is seasoned, well-researched, captivating, and true-to-life. It brings back memories of my first encounter as a young school girl with the heart wrenching plight of the Jewish people when I read \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\".<br /><br />Author Christoph Fischer has such an incredible gift. He is able to quietly and softly bring his reading audience into the lives of his characters and touch their hearts in a memorable and profound way. In 1933, Greta with her kind and gentle manner accepts Wilhelm's offer of marriage after she becomes with child. At the onset of their relationship, he is smitten with her as she visits the book store where he is employed. He persistently pursues this beautiful, intelligent, young Jewish woman with unabashed veracity. She is also aware of this handsome, blond, German man who has definitely piqued her curiosity and eventually succumbs to his amorous advances.<br /><br />After their quick marriage, she stoically adapts to a life on the farm which she has never before experienced. She makes every effort to fit in with Wilhelm's immediate family as well as be at the mercy of the often times harsh and cold reception of his extended family, Johanna and Benedikt. Wilhelm soon finds himself in the midst of emotional turmoil. He is married to a Jewish woman who has given him an Aryan looking, golden headed boy just like himself.  With the rise of Hitler and anti-Semitism, he feels his half Jewish son, three year old Karl, is no longer safe in Bratislava. Greta is now pregnant again and Wilhelm's first reaction is to protect his little family and leave this unsettling situation. It's sad to say that Wilhelm eventually buys into some of the anti-Jewish propaganda and starts to believe in their faulty genetic makeup.  With the help and persuasion of Johanna, he decides to do the unthinkable...<br /><br />Greta, on the other hand, faces the challenges she is now confronted with in her usual honourable, stoic, and admirable manner.  Many unexpected twists and turns take place in the lives of the Weissensteiners as their \\"luck\\" continues to protect them and keep them safe from Jewish deportation. Johanna's previously hard and cold heart is in the process of being thawed as she experiences the gentleness of Jonah...Greta's father.  Johanna is drawn to the love and acceptance she encounters in the midst of this forgiving, loving, and embracing family.  In many ways, Johanna now desires far more to emulate this devoted family rather than shun them like she has in the past. Much to her surprise and confusion, this reaction is an unexpected and unprecedented change of heart.  It is very apparent that the Weissensteiners have the ability to touch many hearts including the Countess and her friends...<br /><br />This touching novel has certainly left its mark on me. Early in the morning...I eagerly rose to read a few more chapters before I started my day.  In the evening before bed time, I engaged in the same activity with not wanting to miss a word in this captivating epic story with plenty of historical facts and authenticity to make every word penned remarkably believable and enticing. I was so expertly drawn into the story line in this incredible novel that I felt mesmerized by the cast of characters depicted...how their lives were intertwined and how their stories unfolded.  This historical novel is such a wonderful and enjoyable read.  Thank you to Author Christoph Fischer for sharing his talent with all of us! Simply put...I loved this book!<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00EGPIZS4 I'm Not Perfect and It's Okay]]PIZS4 I'm Not Perfect and It's Okay]]
0143034901|5.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is well-crafted with impeccable characterization and background. Granted, it does involve reader participation; you can't snooze your way through it. It's also a little slow to get going, but the seemingly pointless tangents all have a reason, and it all eventually comes together. Predictable? Hardly. A gorgeous read, as was blurbed by Stephen King? Yes, indeed. Anyone who loves the written word will like this book.<br /><br />Zafon is a first-class writer blessed with a rare talent, as is his translator. People seldom realize that one language doesn't always have a literal translation into another language. It's up to the usually-unsung translator to make the whole thing coherent. I give the translator high marks for doing such a good job with this book.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't care for was the wrap-up of several minor characters at the end of the story. It was too much of an afterthought, sort of like watching the credits roll across the screen after the movie is finished. I felt that the information, if important enough to include, should have either been woven into the story itself or skipped entirely.<br /><br />Despite the fanciful title, this isn't a romance novel. People who like bodice-rippers or prefer a more superficial read should probably buy something else.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love how the app displays the time on my kindle full screen and how I can adjust the brightness. There are only a few alarm melody options and I wish I could use one of the songs I already have downloaded to the device to wake me up, but for a free app it does its job.

B000NY12LO|5.0|*****(SPOILERS)******<br /><br />I have just completed Nineteen Minutes and wiped the tears out of my eyes to be able to see the screen to write this.  I have had very few books move me like this one.  It is literally one of those books you can't put down.<br /><br />I felt such emotion for Peter. I never thought he should have walked away from this crime.  He  made the choice do this, and the author's only option was to put him in jail for the rest of his life.  But,  I was so emotionally torn by his experiences up to that point.  It was very hard to see him realize what he had done when he read the letter from a shooting victim.  And at the end of the book, his outcome just unraveled me.<br /><br />I felt sorry for his parents, to a point, but thought that it was so obvious that they made differences in their, and they didn't support Peter's strengths like they did Joey's. However, you couldn't help but be moved when both parents admitted to Peter, in their own ways, that they screwed up.<br /><br />I felt the same with Alex.  She was so worried about her career, that she treated Josey like her pet dog.  She pretty much let her raise herself, and when she became involved with a bully, she had no idea that a man should treat you better than that.  After all, Josey had never had a man in her life.  And when she was confronted with an impossible situation, she felt that she didn't have any support anywhere but within herself.  At the point when she killed Matt, she knew what Peter had gone through, only at the other spectrum of high school society, and she thought that if Peter decided this was the way to end the pain, then she would do that too.  It totally supports the theory that children are not rational, even if they seem adult.<br /><br />I think anyone who has teenagers, whether you suspect they are bullies, or bullied, should read this book.  I also think anyone who works in a school system should read this.  I do, and my attitude toward the school that I walk into everyday is different. I see so many Peters and nothing being done to help them.  I do the best I can for them, but I have so little power and the ones who do are satisfied with doing nothing.  This book might help some of the so-called \\"adults\\" stand up and take notice.  After all, your school may be next.<br /><br />I loved Jodi's writing technique.  This was my first book by her, but it will not be the last.  Thanks, Jodi, for a great story.k into everyday is different. I see so many Peters and nothing being done to help them.

There is no part of Phantom that is not wonderful, the music is haunting. I hear it in my sleep. I have enjoyed it constantly and it is every bit as good as Les Miserables

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Doctor Who is great and having it available in full on instant video is even better.  The quality and speed of the site is also a big plus.
B005DZ35RC|1.0|I ordered this DVD, and when I put it in to play on my blue ray player, nothing happened.  The DVD has the screen printed side and the other side for playing.  But there is no data on the disk.  I put it into the computer to check, and there is no data on the DVD.  Of course it is too late to return it for another copy.  This is not the first time I have gotten DVD's from Amazon that had either corrupt or no data on the disk.  I was replacing all VHS with DVD/Blueray.  Make sure you check out the product as soon as you get it.  If you wait, it will be too late.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have heard so much about Minecraft so I thought I would give it try and I needed something to help me pass the time on my bus ride to and from work.  I have never played any of the other versions of this game so that might be part of the problem.  Basically when you launch the game it plops you into the middle of low-res nowhere, standing there holding a brick.  No back story, no game intro, no tutorial, no nothing.  Maybe its supposed to be this way?  The graphics are horrible and I did not find the environment to be engaging or interesting.  There is a menu you can pop up that gives you access to a number of tools for digging and chopping trees, etc., and when you chop a tree down it just floats there without a trunk!  I paid 7 bucks for this game, what a burn.  Maybe I should rent the Xbox version from Redbox so I can see what all the fuss is about.
B000IDGDPA|5.0|I LOVED this movie. So unexpected. Especially for Helen Hunt. I really enjoyed it and think most would too. Try it!!!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|a very good disc. he sings the songs even better than some of the original artists did. it's a classic.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I think the actors did the best they could with this crazy little script. I got lost somewhere in the middle and tried to watch it again, but it was a dumb plot twist. I feel like they were trying to do too much in this movie. I was very disappointed in the civil war ghost. That came out of left field! I'm still unclear how the present day issues mixed with the older one. I would try and watch the movie again, but I don't want to waste my time. I enjoyed John Goodmans bad guy character, and I just felt Tommy Lee Jones was confused half the movie or maybe that was just me. If you're bored go ahead and watch it, just don't expect much.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a great game, but I personally prefer Temple Run 2. It is so much fun!! NOW DO THE HARLEM SHAKE!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This show is great.  Wonderful, engaging characters and it manages to be quite funny while still being a very dramatic and (at times) tragic story.  The things I like most about it are it's attention to detail and current events from the period in which it is set, and the absolutely huge group of (amazingly well casted) characters.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love being on interest.no have the app on my phone and my kindle. My complaint is that on my kindle the app sometimes freezes as I'm looking at suggested pins, as well as it doesn't have the option for quick boards as it does on my phone app.  I do like the quick pin option.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Dark Places doesn't grab you the way Gillian Flynn's newest novel Gone Girl does. It's not nearly as exciting, definitely drags along in the middle, but picks up enough in the end to make up for it. It has a few twists to keep things interesting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun and very addictive although it was a little slow loading the first time it was worth it in the end! definetly get it!
B009O07NMA|5.0|and great music, too boot.  I'm a senior and I enjoyed these guys from the moment they set foot<br />on the Opry stage, so I purchased their CD and now the entire family is enjoying it!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It's really entertaining. Except the part where you have to pay for coin. It makes sense since the game was free but it is still unfortunate.
B004132I20|5.0|I bought it because a coworker said that they enjoyed it and thout I would to. And it is a great show.
B002ZG997C|5.0|If you want to think beyond religion, and stay religious, this will make you believe. The cast is Denzel and those who follow him. The script makes you understand the importance of where we are right now, and what may come. The setting brings you future to past, then tempts you with our current life. The plot shows you the now, the past and the future. As a semi-religious, grown in the South individual, this movie resonates on any level of faith. Not because it was biblical or not, but because it drives home a point of faith, self righteousness and powerful thinking. It's an apocalyptic documentary that rounds up the church choir. Action packed, with meaning that makes you think. Loved it from the start and astounded at the end. One of my favorite movies for intelligent action. Absolutely loved it.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I bought it because a coworker said that they enjoyed it and thout I would to. And it is a great show.

0394818237|5.0|This book is such a gift to my church nursery children. They relate to the jobs and enjoy the animals working. I would recommend this as a gift for a new family because they will read this again and again!
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Interesting psycho killer plot but poorly written. The story is told in first person then as if narrated by a third party. Drove me nuts. Choppy sentences with unneeded words. The detectives act childish at times. A 24 yr old detective sticking her tongue out at another detective, really. After 2 days as a team and just meeting they tell each other all their life secrets and have unending trust... I guess if you have some time to kill, pun intended, read it...  not one of my favorites. As I said good plot poorly written.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible goes everywhere I go & does everything I need it to do. I would highly recommend it to others.
B005OSUKSA|5.0|Never get bored by listening to his violin music.  Extremely soothing, very professional sounds, and Very enjoyable.  One of the best musicians in the world!
0060920084|3.0|I really have liked his previous books and this one is not as good as &#34;A walk in the woods&#34;, but still I have been intertained by reading it!
B00CSCJ09K|4.0|The selection of this CD had lots of variations from classic to pop and rock.  However, any vocal music parts in his CDs do not match with David's quality of violin.  Might as well not to include any vocals.
B008MM9630|5.0|Really enjoy game and daughter too. Cute, fun and addicting! Glad I downloaded it and so will you. Great fun for hours!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I am a Nicholas Sparks fan for &#34;fun&#34; reading.  This book is predictable, but I still like it and it is a page turner.  It is not my favorite of his, but if you are a fan, go for it!
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|Helped to pass the time on a 5 hour train ride. Paul Rudd is hilarious in this flick! I recommend this flick, would watch again
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Creepy and mysterious without being over the top.  Gaiman is a master of tone and setting.  I was hooked right away.  But he also does a superb job in this book of leaving just enough unknown to create a sense of reality.  No character, no matter how bizarre, acts in a way that seems artificial or made up.  Completely believable in an unbelievable way!  Enjoy!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|If you like hidden object games,you should have this one. There is so much to do,and a good variety of different types of searches. I only gave it four stars because it took me a while to really figure the game out. There is a lot going on at once and it can be confusing at times. Also, you can \\"buy\\" your way through the game, which I don't like. They harrass you to leave feedback too.....it obviously worked!!!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This novel of an unusual childhood examines the effects of circumstance and adult choice on the life of the central character. I found it to be always engrossing at the same time that it is not always easy to identify with the central character.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very funny. Loved the clever way all the historical figures were woven into the story. This book makes me look forward to my centennial adventures.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I did like it but felt like it was somewhat indulgent on the authors part....like it must be part of a book not written yet or there was a deadline....but it well written nonetheless.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Running out of interesting cars and tracks, but it's a great game to pass the time. Four more words here.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I don't usually read YA novels but I was told his was a good book. I started reading and couldn't put it down. This is a very good story with great characters in a number of very interesting settings. If you like fantasies you'll love this book. I liked it so much I purchased the next book in the series as soon as I finished City of Bones.
B00E7SID9G|5.0|The author has done an outstanding job analysing all the available religious & non-religious documents to formulate his interpretation of the &#34;history&#34; of Jesus of Nazareth & the follow-on historical events that led to the emergence of Christianity & Jesus Christ. Reza Aslan provide an extensive list of his history resources & if he disagrees with the resources he explains why. I learned more about the Bible, it's authors & the history that led to the formation of Christianity than I ever learned attending Christian churches during my formidable youth & early adult life. Yes, I am aware Reza has been a Christian & has converted back a Islam but he still provides a very objective view of the life of Jesus of Nazareth. As a result, I am purchasing a hard copy of his book to supplement my electronic version.
0525953728|5.0|I mentioned 'For Veteran' because I honestly believe, only a veteran with some field combat experience or training, can fully appreciate all of the descriptive wording. Having experienced the sounds, smells, excitement, and fears, I found was actually experiencing anxiety as I felt part of the action. Simple in style, accurate and a good read.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Hi I'm Legoisaac 3895 in roblox be my bro plz<br />This needs co op this a great game say ya+I play csp
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|Excellent book !!! I think the principles can be applied anywhere. Well written and concise. If you want to succeed, this book gives you some really good advice.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|I loved the game and all but it would freeze my kindle all the time forcing my to shut down my kindle. I had to end up deleting the app just so I could play my kindle!!!!!8(
0316247545|5.0|I'm not a pony fan, but my kids are.  This book has it all...back story, episode synopses, song lyrics.  Just a note that it's probably for older fans who can read it themselves, because you probably won't want to read it aloud :)
B00280LYIM|5.0|I would recommend this book to all fourth graders because I am a fourth grader. I really love this book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The spare story-telling style in The Book Thief was, to me, perfect for describing the horrors endured by the characters. Every so often throughout the book there are bits of prose that would knock me back in their beauty. The author's use of only a few words to paint a picture is amazing. Frankly I'm sad to see that they're turning this book into a movie. Part of the wonderful-ness of this book is the tapestry of words used to give meaning to events that were overwhelming in their brutality. Interestingly, I had no idea this was a &#34;young adult&#34; novel until I read other reviews. That designation is completely irrelevant with this book.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I enjoy it.  Nice fantasy and it is predictable enough so that I can just listen to the audio and glance at the video once in a while without missing anything.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This wonderful story begins in an unassuming way, to develop character, plot and conflict, all emanating  from the death of one man in the town of Pagford. The author skillfully draws us into the complexity of behaviors and actions by juxtaposing one character to another and raising unresolved issues in every chapter. As the \\"plot thickens\\", tensions rise until a bitter ending causes change within the town and its people. This story is a highly satisfying \\"read\\". while also drawing  one's attention to the frailty and flaws of human nature.<br />  Sharen Metz Langdon
B00AYB16EO|2.0|I know this is a cult favorite, but it's just a stupid movie. For those who like dumb movies, I recommend it. Otherwise try Monty Python.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This can  is really fun and time consuming, good for long car rides. It's challenging and you need a good eye for detail. Good luck!
B00DDQTKHM|4.0|Finally! International digital marketing comes out of the shadows.<br /><br />There's no dearth of books on &#34;new marketing&#34;, PR, Social Media, etc.  But they're nearly all myopic in their perspective - speaking just to American companies about how to use content marketing methodologies of various flavors to support their domestic US leadgen efforts.<br /><br />David Meerman Scott brings his global business background to this book - and that perspective sets his work apart.  Rather than naturally assume that companies will and should only sell domestically, instead his default position is that these tools now support the natural opportunity that exists for every company.  The opportunity is to sell into whatever markets they can do so profitably - and intelligent application of inbound marketing enables companies to expand into more markets profitably.<br /><br />It's a valuable perspective that American companies would do well to consider amidst increasingly global markets.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Most bands have an amazing first album, and they slowly decline after that. Volbeat blows this pattern out of the water. Their first album was awesome, and they just keep getting better!
B00C061I3K|4.0|I would describe the music on this record as dance music, but more like disco than some recent dance genre. Regardless of what you call the music though, it's just good music. Both the melodies and rhythms are strong. The lyrics may not be quite as strong, but they work. I'm not generally a big fan of robot sounding vocals, but even the distorted voices on this record sound pretty good, and oddly enough the lyrics are easy to understand. The normal human vocals are even better. Some catchy music (and this is certainly catchy music!) gets boring pretty quickly, but this music is interesting enough to listen to repeatedly.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I used Quantum Wireless as my reseller because they were listed on the FIOS site.  I received a Genuine E6.  i use this amp to provide a little more boost to the speakers I installed in my helmet (Shark Motorcycle Audio Radio Headset kit for Half-Face Motorcycle Helmet)<br />It boosts the volume so that I can hear it over wind noise WITH earplugs in.  Run time seems to be about 6-7 hours. when the battery runs out there is no pass through, the music just stops. My ipod battery lasts much much longer.  this is small and portable. I used Velcro to attach it to the back of my ipod.<br />Its small, portable, and inexpensive.  Because of that it gives up a lot of features. I think its a decent trade off for how i'm using it.
B00BDSRISA|3.0|The songs, the playing and the singing on this record are OK but not great. I find the synth sound and the voices wear on me after a while. I think Phoenix's 'Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix' had catchier tunes.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. At first I was not sure what this book was going to be about so the story was an unexpected surprise!
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|This is an amazing story of courage and fortitude. I'm not a mountain climber but I can understand the desire to always push oneself a bit harder.
B005544V6A|5.0|I don't like many series and I'm particularly burned out on lawyer shows but Suits has become one of my favorites.  I don't know if it's the cast and how well they blend or the somewhat left-brained writing or the comic relief of Louis Litt or the fact that I have a huge crush on Donna but it never fails to entertain me.  Maybe someone else can be more circumspect about it but it's another win for USA Network and yet more proof that the age of the broadcast networks may be coming to a close.
B000QK7YQ2|4.0|My husband saw this documentary as a kid in the 70's. It's just as good today! A great nostalgia video for the whole family.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I read The Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns... I could not wait until this book was released, but compared to his previous books, this one was a dissapointment. I was not able to get into the story like with the other two novels. I could feel the heartbreak, the anger, the pain, the joy, happiness... and was living it with the character in the book but that unfortunately did happen this time.It started off very promising but then jumped around to much.  Mr. Hoseeini is a great story teller, there is absolutely no doubt about it, but this story was not as capturing and it was to jumpy and confusing for me. I absolutely LOVE A Thousand Splendid Suns, it is one of the best books I have ever read in my life, so my expectations were very high.It just didn't do it for me this time but I will continue reading his books and hope for the next story to be better. I simply love the way he writes, so beautiful. He has a true gift in writing. Looking forward to his next book I'm sure it will be better.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I love the three books i have read so far. Hopefully all the books in the series are just as good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I knew she wasn't dead, but I did not want it to end the way it did. They were both psycho.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked the plot and action, better then I was expecting.  Tom Cruise is better in this then in his recent movies.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|I NEEDED THIS MOVIE TO SEE WHAT I COULD WEAR FOR A PARTY IN THE HAMPTONS. IT ARRIVED LATE SO BACK IT GOES
0316044695|5.0|Great book and well written.  Too bad we lost this great man and patriot.  This is informative and would definitely recommend it.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Classic.  I officially fell in love with Queen Latifah over her performance in this.  And of course I was already in love with Gere...  Definitely a good choice for movie night!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie...this and Back to the future. Both show that we have the choice to make our future whatever we would like it to be. He had to make the choice to open his eyes and question everthying...thats when you find the truth that will set you free.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I have wanted this dvd for a long time, and finally treated myself. This movie is so much fun! Romance, comedy, intrigue....what more can you ask for?
B005544TRQ|5.0|Loved it! I wish Season 3 was available for Prime already, but I definitely loved Season 1 and 2 and being able to watch them in high quality with Amazon Prime was the icing on the cake.
B00DW5IKJI|3.0|To be honest,I don't exactly get the point of this...There are already a heap of \\"greatest hits\\" compilations for her,one being released just a few months ago.I guess I just don't see the overall idea here because Britney has at least an album's worth(if not more) of unreleased material that could be put to good use for something like this,instead of the same top 25 hits literally everyone knows already.Just a thought...
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Since the show ended earlier this year, I've been in withdrawals.  So I decided to watch it from the beginning!  I'm hooked all over again!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|A really good read and difficult to put down<br />Well written novel with an intristic plot. Love the way it is written.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|So far completed Entrrprise series and Voyager, now watching Next generation, then onto deep Space nine, before watching the original Star Trek series again. Thank you Amazon
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Has alot of dialog but it is fun to play &amp; all parts of the game function well on S4. I haven't downloaded many of the FAOTDs lately, but this one I'll keep.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Matthew McConaughey was wonderful portraying a defense lawyer that may have crossed the ethics line a few times...yet you found yourself rooting for him and his clients. Great ending!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|just the right amount of challenge while still allowing for success. Great way for easy entertainment. great graphics. great. great. great.
B000HL09SA|4.0|A good movie about loyalty and growing up. I would recommend it! Some of the subject matter may be a little difficult for younger viewers.
B001MSMULG|1.0|Another cliche hit man story.  I keep trying to find something original and I keep failing.  I wont read another Daniel Silva book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is a game we share and work together. nice family game. great graphics also. i do think some of the times are a little long though.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Bought this for my husband who is a big fan of John Fogerty and classic Credence. He liked most of the duos, especially Kid Rock.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Watched The Conjuring tonight. This movie is to be avoided if:<br /><br />- You get easily scared<br />- You don't get so easily scared + another one on this list<br />- You get easily offended by the use of religious objects in movies<br />- You simply don't like this genre of movies<br /><br />If you don't fit the above criteria, then you might end up enjoying this movie. For starters, it really is kind of old school scary in a way, with wonderful image, sound and focus management to create a suspense environment that will leave you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I read this is based on a true story of Ed and Lorraine Warren. There are many things explained along the movie that to this day are true, and not a product of fiction. Definitely worth watching, I suspect this one will easily become a classic of the genre... oh and watch 13 Ghosts either before or after to complement to overall training session.<br /><br />Definitely getting the BR as soon as it releases... ;)
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|I have no idea how to work this thing and there is no obvious help menu or any other menu.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I rarely recommend books but recommend this novel to anyone who can read.<br />Weeks later, I am still thinking about this book.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|My 5 year old likes it, so that's all I care about. It is kind of annoying because one of the characters has pricklies all over her, so for like 5 minutes, you keep hearing &#34;OUCH...OUCH...OUCH&#34; over and over when she's &#34;pulling them out&#34; with tweezers.
B003IY48PS|1.0|the blu ray case was already unwrapped when it arrived and the cover was slightly damaged, that is why I gave it 1 star
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|The last one and its a sweet ride. Roger is missed but not by much. Great tunes and production. Listen to it weekly. The new remaster is crisp and clean.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a cool app.  You have to find all the hidden objects to get through the game.  It takes your brain power to a whole new level.  I really liked it because I like challenging apps.  I hope they get more levels soon.  I got through all of them and can't wait for more.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I liked puzzles even as a child now I can play with my grandchildren. Keeps the mind sharp. I like the idea of different levels of play also.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Everybody seems to like Twitter.  It wasn't for me though.  I was bogged down by social medias and got rid of all of them, including this one.  My family is on it all the time....me, I'd rather read a good book.  Not downing the app, it's really great if you into that type of thing and listening to everyone's day, but I have enough going on in my day so I never had time for it.  I say if you have the time and you like the connection of your friends and family, then go for it.  It'll definitely keep you updated.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I just loved this book. I highly recommend it. It is not a hard read, but not an easy one either. It is definitely something you have to think about as you read it, and worth every thought to put into it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like to play this game.  It's fun to watch the coins fall and to rack up on the prizes too.  Strategy is the name of the game.  It's a pretty fun app if you want mindless playing to pass the time.  Go ahead, try it.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|You can read just so many murder mysteries before they all start to run together but Nesbo still does a good job of keeping your attention. But now it is time to find another story angle.  Maybe I'll reread Mary Roach's book about our digestive track.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Just couldn't stay with this story. It was my own fault, I don't usually go for the supernatural and I just had a hard time following this.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My daughter and I LOVE this movie and I am glad I was able to purchase it online so we could watch it together while her daddy was out of town!!!!
1476733953|4.0|Very interesting, easy to read, and fun dystopia novel.  The book is broken down into five short novellas, and this makes sense as the writing style, language, and characters change a lot, especially through the first three sections.  The short chapters and cliffhanger writing style are a bit trite, and the ending seems to quick and clean.  Howey is a decent writer, but mostly, this book was just a fun summer read.
B004Q3SGNK|3.0|I wish the ending was better.<br />The entire movie was great until the end and you didn't really get to see much on how his life has been since the accident which was really upsetting.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|Great to see Henry Fonda play a bad guy, and he does it superbly.  A little slow at times, but works towards overall feel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game so much. I have about 56 keys because I play all day long. Thank u so much for making this game. Email me every body. Emilyluvchloe@gmail.com Thank you
B00CXQL828|5.0|Amazing first release.  Solid song writing, solid musicianship with Kotzen, Sheehan and Portnoy- supergroup. Best rock CD I have bought in years...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like everything about this game except I can't get very many gems!<br />I really like this horse game a lot the horse is cute!
B007AL48UK|4.0|Plenty of schemes and yet not enough for a mahjong addict. Levels of skill increase kinda incrementally with patterns from left to right. Good level of fun & interest in each. All can be solved in 5 or less, with practice. I just wish there were more layouts!!<br /><br />Tap any tile not \\"legal\\" to dim all currently unmatchable tiles and you will see the currently eligible tiles.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Arnold couldn't be better.  More down to earth in this movie but Arnold will always be Arnold.  Doesn't let you down.
B005NNV044|5.0|This re-mastered version is first rate.  Catchy tunes like \\"Fearless\\" and \\"St. Tropez\\" demonstrate the breadth of this band's genius.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Great addition to the series and the addition of a &#34;son&#34; in this one was totally unexpected, surprising but enjoyable.
B0012QRPU4|1.0|I didn't like this at all, so now I am saved many hours of watching past or future episodes.<br /><br />Bring on &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; with its superb script and fabulous acting.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|A really great new and enjoyable twist to an age old story.  Always nice to see the &#34;good guys&#34; win.
1476733953|5.0|I loved this entire series. Wool the first book, was such a fast read but it was so well written.  It was a refreshing change to the things I have been reading lately. I can't write a better review than others here, but I wanted to add a few of my own thoughts:<br /><br />* the story is sci fi - ish... some people hate sci fi, but this isn't really sci fi! Give it a shot, I am sure you won't be completely turned off by it<br />* There are a lot of open questions at the end of the book... but this is a series! Questions get answered later :)<br />* The character development is great.<br />* THere is a lot of fan fiction out there, which is a testament to how popular this book is! I haven't read any yet, but it's important to know the difference because I almost bought the wrong book in the series not knowing it wasn't written by the original author<br /><br />Read it!!! You won't be disappointed.
6305744793|5.0|This Is A Very Good Movie Version Of The Addams Family TV Show.It Has Quite A Few Laughs And A Good Story Line.I Enjoyed It Very Much.

B004NOCCEG|5.0|educates on how some people manipulate our system for personal gain. editing is a factor, still gets the message across.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Actually the thing I truly like is the ability to change the difficulty level, so if you desire a fast, fun and winnable game you can. And if you want a game that the veriables are set against you... go for it. /
193700788X|1.0|I can't agree more with the many reviewers who have pegged this book as rushed, full of characters acting completely out of character and lacking any sort of real ending. It felt to me that the author had given up or run out of ideas, so in order to meet her deadline, she slapped some very poorly thought out words on paper and sent it to her publisher who knew people would buy the book no matter how awful.<br /><br />As a fellow author, I won't get too catty toward Ms. Harris, but it would have been nice if she could have put a little more effort into her big finale....<br /><br />In a nutshell, too many complex (and unbelievable) plot lines that could have used several hundred more pages to properly attempt to tie up. I'm not sure that all of the random and out of place storylines would have turned out better, but at least I wouldn't have gotten to page 250 of 253 and asked myself, \\"How on earth can this crazy, long journey that has spanned so many books, end in 3 pages?!\\". Well, it certainly did end, and so did my interest in any future CH books. :(
0784011176|4.0|Saw movie<br />Bought piano sheet music<br />Wanted to own DVD<br />Good addition to library<br />Wish shipping were not so high<br />Understand not much can be done
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a very fun game to play. You can interact with others. I feel they try to get you to buy credits.  Other than that it's a very fun game
B0089EHWQE|4.0|seemed to have a bit of slow start, but by the time the stage was set I was hooked.  Great story!!
B008MEM24S|4.0|Everyone in the family enjoys this game. I get addicted to it each time I begin to play it. It is fun.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really got caught up in this one.  It is funny, sad, and thoughtful. I really want to think about it for awhile and then read it again.
B00821OX98|5.0|Addicting series. Loved the characters and stories.  Cant wait for the most recent series to be offered free for prime members!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is well written and entertaining, but the last third of the book was a bit of a disappointment.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun way to kill time. Could use a graphics upgrade and smoother control access.. The price is right and it moves fast. NO PROBLEMS.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|Never disappoints! Still waiting for Amazon to show the sequel.  The characters were even more lifelike in HD than the first time I saw this film.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I bought this video to view and to share with a grandchild.  We liked this version of Gatsby better than the 2013 version that was in the theaters.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is a good series.  Very Creepy but that is what keeps you watching it. You have been worned...it makes you &#34;jump&#34; and is not for the weak of stomach.  You just keep watching hoping that good wins over evil.
B001FQMOCA|5.0|I have saw this movie over a hundred times. I cannot get enough of Joaquin and Reese. This makes me wish I would have paid more attention to June and Johnny when they were alive. Awesome movie.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I bought the world pass and I finished some levels and then it disappeared. So I uninstalled and did it again and it did the same thing...  Could u help please
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book will change your life. Every person on the planet needs to read this book - the world would be a much better place.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|This is an excellent remaining of a cult classic. I was a little upset when heard was not going to be a &#34;funny&#34; version but really did the story justice!
1476733953|5.0|I cant put the book down.  At the end of every chapter it leaves you with wanting to figure out more.  The author has some serious talent!!!!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|download best game ever it has swagger it has all sorts of quiz on it it is sweet and radicule
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It's a decent enough movie, but it's equally forgettable when all is said and done.  Some of the topics are awkward if you've got kids watching, even though there isn't any blatant nudity or violence.  That being said, it was worth the price of the rental & I always enjoy watching many of the actors featured.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down until I knew what happened to everyone. I read it in about a week. Really good. Really sad.
B009G78EE2|4.0|I bought this album because I really liked 2 songs on here & my kids liked more.  I also really like that these artists picked up where Pearl Jam left off with independent music.  That is, where Pearl Jam rebelled against Ticketmaster back in the day, Macklemore et. al. wisely departed from the standard producing formula to do it on their own.  For that alone, I'd buy another of their albums.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Great movie, actors were phenomenal. I am definitely looking forward to the next one, I have been nothing but pleased with the new Star Trek movies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Not a total fangirl or anything but I really liked the insight into the experience of the great war and the social changes it set into motion.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Good movie. Natalie Portman doesn't add much to it but Chris Hemsworth is very good as Thor, the conceited son of Odin and heir to the Asgardian throne. Thor becomes humbled and learns self sacrifice when he is banished to earth.  Everyman SHIELD agent Phil Coleson gets a decent sized part as well in this Marvel superheroe film
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Looking forward to seeing where next season takes the Crawleys et al. Wondering if the show's writers and directors can keep the show up to par.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters and story lines in these books! Can't wait for the next book to come out!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show! Love the way the story is unfolding. Just enough drama to keep me interested! Can't wait for the next season to be on Prime.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Out of all the bingo apps I've tried this one is by far my favorite.  Look forward to playing every day
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I'm going to sum up the G13 without getting into too much detail.  I purchased this from Amazon and have owned it for about a year I think.  I honestly do not every want to go back to the keyboard for gaming.  I need the keys to be straight in a row (unlike the WASD) because of my slight OCD.  I have customized so many of the keys on the G13.  The more I used it, the more keys I could keep adding to the custom configuration.  Now I have the three top rows of keys completely assigned to buttons, and the bottom three unassigned because your palm tends to hit them regularly.  The keys aren't missed anyway, because they're an awkward reach anyway.<br /><br />Another thing that I'm sure a lot of readers are curious about is the joystick.  The G13's joystick CAN BE ANALOG IF YOU WANT IT TO BE.  There are a lot of people that have wanted a gameboard to utilize a joystick for multiple reasons, and so far I think the G13 is the only one that has ever made their joystick able to be completely analog.  Well, anyway, I love you.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Good family movie.  I do not have &#34;17 more words to write about it!&#34;...Its a dvd. Its good. The kids like it. Period
B003XREL98|5.0|I read this book almost 90 years after its writing. India is very modern and westernized today, but this book is still a passage to India!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This story seems to follow life in Afganistan in a way that seems truthful and realistic.  What an amazing life for this family.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Of all the note taking apps, i am addicted to Handy Note Pro. Simple and intutive. Works great on my samsung note 2
B008Y6QZ56|3.0|The filming of the fights look real and quite something in this sport.  Slow plot and shalow charactors.  But entertaining.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Such a good game. The jobs kinda hard and money hard to get but otherwise one of my favourites worth 499.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I wish I could get this time back. Horrible writing, directing and acting. Do not waste your time or money on this flick!
0553062182|4.0|I thought it was about spd kids... but it's ok. My child will grow. I am going to look more books on your site
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it, but wish they had more episodes per season!  Can't wait for the next season to begin.  Patiently waiting it's return
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm definitely a fan for life!!!!! Heard a song on the VMA' s that had me hooked. Can't wait to hear more from them.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This series is outstanding. I love the time period, with the attire and the manners. I especially love the english humor.<br />Character development is outstanding.
B009LDCXNY|4.0|I've been a fan of this show since season 1 and nothing has changed yet. This is a must have season and I can't wait to complete my collection when it's released. There was some unexpected twists and turns this season and I'm already looking forward to the next one. Sam's character makes more sense with his personality traits after this season. The only thing I would have liked would have been to see more of Castiel and Crowley.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I own it on DVD and have watched it at least a half dozen time.  I won't comment much on the plot, since that information is easily available from plenty of places.  I will say that even though it is an adventure story, not a drama or mystery, there are some subtle things that can be missed in only a single viewing.<br /><br />What I want most to say is this: I hope everyone keeps in mind that Edgar Rice Borroughs wrote the book about 100 years ago -- way, way, way ahead of his time.  Many very popular sci-fi movies pulled ideas from his books, so if any details of this movie look familiar, please keep in mind, this is the original, the others are the knock-offs.  The movie has elements tailored for \\"big kids\\" and elements more-so tailored for adults.  I, as an adult, would have been happy with a thoroughly adult rendition, but I understand the movie-makers decision to target a wider audience.<br /><br />This is a very, very good story (not always true in movies these days), and it is well told.  There is a whole set of books, and I definitely hope to see more of them made into movie -- the richness is begging to grace the screen.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|How Christopher Nolan could have been associated with this is a total mystery. Or maybe I've overestimated Nolan. Either way, this movie is to be avoided at all costs.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had been hearing a lot about Downton Abbey and had to check it out.  Normally, I don't love period pieces but this one is captivating.  Maggie Smith is rye and enjoyable.  If nothing else, you have to wait to see what she's going to say.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This game is for amatuers and kids.  It is not challenging at all.  If it is free you may want to get it.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I felt like this movie was sweet and light hearted. I was fun to see Barbara Streisand in such a fun role.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I read the comic book when I was a kid and was really disappointed that most people's exposure to Judge Dredd began and ended with the terrible Sylvester Stallone movie in 1995.  This movie really gets it right--a fun shoot 'em up movie that does justice to the character and world of Judge Dredd.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Could not even get through the first 15 minutes. Tom Cruise is not very compelling in this role, and the script lacked originality.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|Male and female, ages 20something to 50something, all enjoyed it. We'd seen it years ago, but it still is a well-paced, funny film. That it's based on a true story makes it even more enjoyable.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The Avengers was pretty good.........Im not a Marvel fan, but overall it kept my attention ....alot of actoin and Robert Downey Jr did his thing.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|This movie kept us in the dark until the very end. I thought I knew what was going on at first but was shown a totally different scenario towards the end of the movie.  I highly recommend this movie.  Jude Law was great.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is a book series that pretty much has everything one would need to get hooked. It's got action, romance, and fantasy all bounded into one book. Bought and read through all 5 books within 2 days. That's how catchy it was for me.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Love all the different artists on this recording! I'm listening in my car and on my Kindle everyday.  Good album.
0345803493|5.0|Excellent! Exactly what I thought it would be!!! Very satisfied with this product and the seller. Would definitely recommend to others.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I like the show because it has history included in the story. I am officially hooked to the soap opera
B00CXQL828|5.0|This is hands down the best CD I've heard in a long time. These guys are my (and my 7 year old son's) favorite new band. All three individuals are incredible and together they are a force to be reckoned with. Every song on the CD is solid. I hope these guys are around for a long time!
B00B22ASUM|3.0|I had read a review on this that gave it glowing praise. I am a cat lover and decided to give it a read.  It was OK, but I was disappointed in the read
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although we may think we know what is going to happen, I love that the writer of this series keeps us guessing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great show to escape from everyday life with. My sister in law and I love it and look forward to the next season!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I am extremely happy to have this alarm clock app on my Kindle!!!! Thanks! It's a really great app! Did I say it is awesome?
B00BY8DFRW|5.0|Yes indeed! Notice I said &#34;MY favorite&#34; and not &#34;the BEST album of 2013&#34;. Cuz, well, that's for you to decide. But this is my review and all I can say is this album is astonishing!!! I honestly believe it is Deep Purple's masterpiece. Yes, it's that good! And it totally made up for the lukewarm &#34;13&#34; from Black Sabbath (my favorite band), that I had been anticipating like - beyond words. I'm not gonna break this down and do a song by song thing because if you're inclined to purchase this, I think it would be better not to taint any expectations with my opinions. It's just a wonderful album that will still be great 40 years from now and beyond.
044042321X|5.0|a fun re-telling of GOT in comic book form.  I thought it was fun and the art was similar to what my imagination had created so thats a bonus.  i just wish it had been longer :) cant wait to get the next one, and I hope they keep it up with a 3rd edition soon!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This is a movie my whole family enjoyed!  WORTH the money!!  The actions was good and the CGI was amazing.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I thought the pilot to the series was very interesting and well done. I hope the rest of the episodes continue to be so enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Rating: 5 Stars - Perfect<br /><br />Wow! I can not believe it has taken me so long to read a Colleen Hoover novel. She is a master story teller with a beautiful writing voice. The twist and turns had me engrossed till the very end. I am now a huge fan of Colleen Hoover and look forward to reading more of her novels.<br /><br />Now I know what all the hype was about with Holder in the blogosphere. Hands down Holder is the sexiest, swoon worthy hero. Holder is intense and is either angry or charming there is no in between with him. He is passionate about life, love, words, his sister and best of all about Sky. Loved his character from his sexy tattoo (which was awesome and love what it meant) to his sweet, caring and a bit of an alpha male attitude.<br /><br />Sky is what I love in my heroines that are broken on the inside. Loved that she knows she is broken, does not know why, but still has a backbone. She is not over the top whiney or too strong willed. She has her moments of breaking down and if I was in her shoes I would be a complete basket case. Loved that she was able to go head to head with Holder and it was not over the top but perfect with the story line.<br /><br />I adore Sky's best friend Six. She is spunky and everyone should have a true best friend like her. She was perfect for Sky and loved their scenes together.<br /><br />I could not swipe my kindle fast enough to see if Holder and Sky would get their HEA. If any couple in the history of novels deserves a HEA it is Holder and Sky. They are hot-fan-your self together and their scenes are well written.<br /><br />Even though there is no cliffhanger and has a beautiful ending, I still need more of Holder and Sky. I am begging Colleen Hoover to please make this a series. At least I still have Holder's POV in Losing Hope (Hopeless #2) to get my fix.<br /><br />I love the blurb as it is mysterious. I have to say I had no idea going in what Hopeless was about and was shocked so many times. Kudos to Colleen Hoover for taking two major issues and creating a powerful story with many layers at a good pace. Be prepared to be shocked and have many tissues handy.<br /><br />ARC provided by publisher, Atria Books at NetGalley for an honest review.<br /><br />Originally posted at Wickedly Delicious Book BlogHoover for taking two major issues and creating a powerful story with many layers at a good pace.

B007AL48UK|2.0|I probably  would rate it higher, but I don't know how  to play it and I didn't see any instructions for it. It was bought by mistake.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is their best hands down. Can't tell you how many times I've listened to it. You will not be disappointed, every song is amazing.
B0090SI4OC|2.0|Like everyone says, the book is great (the audio book is even better as Kate Reading does a spectacular job voice acting).  With that said, there is too much in the book to be made into a 2 hour movie.  It needs to be a miniseries, but more importantly, it NEEDS to be told from a FIRST PERSON POINT OF VIEW.  The movie is in third person, the book is in first person.  The reason the book is so good is that we learn about Wanda and her growth into humanity from the first person--we see/understand everything from her alien point of view!  In the movie this is entirely absent so the \\"wow\\" factor of the premise is completely lost.  I hope someone with money realizes this at some point and remakes this great book into a miniseries with a first person narrator playing the role of Wanda.<br /><br />Props to the set designers though...the cave scenes are done well and the lead actress does a good job with bad direction.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Keeps you interested and wanting more!!!! It's going to be torture til the next one comes out!!!! I can't wait!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone who has doubts about the hereafter.  The author was very descriptive about his experience - couldn't put the book down.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was an excellent read.  I recommend it to people of appropriate age group all the way to older adults.<br />I read it in middle school and re-read it as an adult and thoroughly enjoyed it both times.
1449410243|5.0|this book is for you!  Matthew Inman  knows cats!!  We all  enjoyed it together as a family! I even paraphrased  parts  so I could share it with my little niece.  We've  loaned  it out twice already to fellow cat people.  Makes a  excellent gift!  Seriously relatable funny stuffs!
B009WUBERW|3.0|Good mindless action movie.  Nothing to special.  Lots of bodies, explosions and stupid one liners.  I would recommend for a rainy day.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Just like most people here, this show is superbly done. A couple complaints.. sometimes tough to follow dialog therefore a center channel or good sound bar should help. I even enable closed captioning. Also, I think the show runs a little long. It seems like it should end but drags on a couple of chapters. Would like to give it 4.5 / 5
1250010489|5.0|Trojan Horse is an amazing read! I enjoyed it as much as Mark's previous book Zero Day.<br /><br />Trojan Horse is a thriller that will make you worry about the importance of IT security and the fragility of the world's information and power grid infrastructure.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|This is a great movie. The quality of picture and sound were awesome. i am new to amazon prime and i am VERY happy with it so far. Back to the movie...LOVE IT!! I wanted to see it after I saw the new Star Trek with Khan and although I LOVE Comberbach, no one can beat Ricardo Montalban in my book. Of course, i'm from the Shatner, Nimoy Star Trek generation so I am biased.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I rarely buy a CD from movies but I really liked this movie and just happen to come across the CD and just loved all the selections on it; highly recommend this CD.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|This series holds my attention although at times it is confusing to follow some of the stories. Also it is difficult for me to hear all of the dialogue, even though I use a speaker at high volume. Sometimes the voice are just mumbled. It would be good if Amazon included closed captioning.
1452101248|5.0|I'm new to this style of cooking and this book gives me a lot of confidence that I will have success when I try any recipe here.
B0039RY3MM|4.0|This new version of Coollaboratory Liquid's metal TIM (thermal interface material) is supposed to be easier to apply than the old one, but the brush included to apply it seemed to suck up half the TIM it was &#34;spreading&#34; around. I eventually was able to scrape a bunch of it off the brush, but it still wasted quite a bit of material...<br /><br />Not sure on performance yet, haven't compared it to anything else-- debating cleaning it off and applying Arctic Silver 5 to see how they compare, but given how good this stuff is *supposed* to be and how bloody expensive it is per application, it may not be worth the trouble...<br /><br />Also, strongly suspect this product is better used between the IHS and the CPU die directly on Intel CPUs such as Haswell, where the factory TIM would benefit greatly from being replaced, vs. the IHS-to-heatsink interface which is larger and less critical on TIM performance differences.
B001NN413K|1.0|I purchased this DVD then when I got it home it wouldn't play. When I messaged the seller they stated that it was made for dvd players in the UK only. Why the hell would I buy something living in the US that is only made for the UK???? I was not made aware of this when I purchased it nor was there any kind of warning in the selling description. I have requested my money back to no avail. I am being told that I have to pay to ship it back to the UK before they will consider returning my money. I'm disgusted.
B001NLL93W|4.0|A lot of action but Boring at parts. Liked the ending very awesome and descriptive. On to book four! YAY!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Very cool to see this rockumentary and the history of this place. It's a movie about a sound board. Doesn't get better than that.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Gentle period piece about small towns in England during the Victorian Era.  The development of the secondary characters in this show is reminiscent of Northern Exposure.
B003U51D58|5.0|I was very pleased with the show and although it took some really where turns, I found it very satisfying.  I watched it on a trial of amazon prime and thought the service was great as well.  I recommend it to all who want solid entertainment and great quality.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love angry birds, and they have new boards in rio, i was really excited to pkay...very worth the download..
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Tells you the weather and forecast.  Not rocket science and doesn't need to be.  Works well and is easy to use.
B00BYM5I1O|4.0|Guy Clarke always delivers; great lyrics and excellent musicianship. A little lower key than some of his earlier offerings. Well worth a listen.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I look forward to Philippa Gregory's books but this one has repetitive content and is not as well written as most of her other<br />books on the cousin's war or Tudor dynasty. It seems as though it was written in a rush to satisfy a deadline. Not the usual quality.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn continues to captivate me in this Afghanistan-Washington D.C. thriller. The book took turns going in places I never dreamed. Absolutely riveting!
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Only 4 stars because there isn't a District 10.<br />Of all the Hollywood trash thats out with sequels to horrible movies and not an original idea among the morons,<br />this begged for a sequel.
B00DU74U74|5.0|A very good story told with plausible detail and suspense.  Good characters with depth of their own.  The love story wins out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 9yo daughter loves this game!  I have to limit her hours otherwise she would play this all day!  Love the color and sharpness of the picture.  Lots of options and many hours of fun.  Definitely for kids 7 and older.  Need the quick hand eye coordination to be successful.
B004N6369Y|5.0|This was a fascinating book with great story lines.  Very descriptive and got to feel connected to the characters very easily.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Love to see all the old school action heroes getting together and put a high energy, action-packed movie in thier older years!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Addictive game that is fun and keeps you busy and involved. Wish that you could change coins for the blue game tokens. Also hard to complete the different game object goals.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This book is really good and I really enjoyed reading it thumbs up!!!<br />Awesome<br />Book:)  Jeff is a amazing author
B0058VW36U|4.0|Okay, I admit it, I am not very good at this game but I still enjoy playing it. I like the graphics and the challenge.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I purchased this for a gift at Christmas! Was not disappointed!! No complaints about the movies I have purchased online!
0714864803|3.0|I love the design of this cookbook, from the crenelated edges to the full color photos. But it needs to be re-edited.  Many of the recipes are incomplete, confusing, mis-titled, or not quite right.  Would love to see a new edition.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|I purchased this for a gift at Christmas! Was not disappointed!! No complaints about the movies I have purchased online!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Slow beginning, but interesting if you are interested in BUDS.  But awesome towards the end when he tells the story that happened to him.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Plan on losing some sleep - you won't want to put it down. Guaranteed - you will start seeing the world in a different way.
1742200206|5.0|Just...complete, like almost every LP-guide. That I say without being sponsored by them or what, just like to travel with their guides in my luggage.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Good for when you're just trying to relax and listen to some good music. You get what you expect, which is good in this case.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Cute but slow to play. It takes long time to step up in stages.  Overall cute graphics. Great for kids.
006112429X|5.0|This book had tension like nothing I have read in years. It really leaves one wondering if there is fault to place with a kid's parents, or if there is just something in the nature of the kid that causes him to be evil. In this case, I felt myself siding with the mother even though it is hard for me to understand not being able to bond with my own child. I think the father's reaction to the mother's fears was not only irresponsible, but deplorable. And the tension, especially toward the book's climax, raised the hairs on the back of my neck.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|This would have to be one of the very best series that I have read. I have been recommending it to friends. Jeffrey Archer is a very Great writer.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book kept me guessing the whole way through. Like the first book, I could not put it down and read it in three days. My only criticism is that the next book is not out yet!<br />Mo
B0079TQHDO|5.0|I just loved the whole series of the Clifton Chronicles, Sadly,  I spent my days reading and got nothing else done.  My house is looking very neglected, also the gardens. I'm still hoping that there will be a fourth book in this series...
B005LAIH2W|5.0|when i first heard about this film i thought, 'how is THAT going to work?  how are they going to update an edgar rice burroughs novel to make it interesting enough for today's audience...<br />well...the movie, itself, is the answer...<br />i can go on about what was great about it...but i'd rather you take the risk and see for yourself...and it's pretty ok for kids, as well...<br />there ARE violent/warfare type scenes, though...<br />qualitywise, i'd say it was a bit better than 'stargate', which was also a bit of a surprise...<br />i've seen, literally, 1000s of movies...it's the only credential i can offer...but what i'm trying to convey is that i know about films/ storytelling...if you're on the fence about seeing it and this review sounds at all appealing, please treat yourself to an unexpected pleasure...
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|A good story, well told with the exception of too many coincidental things happening to make it all work.<br />Beyond that, it was a great idea for a book.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Story seems to slightly stray from the original classic (though I admit I'm too lazy to ever read the original classic), and offered surprises that kept the viewing very entertaining.  Did I mention that I particularly like the epilog?
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|You know it is just what it says it is a handy note pro,,,,,,, it is a wonderful little handy book to have
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It has extra lenght and it works just like other USB ports. I like it but at the same time I really don't need it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|You mean to tell me that you can read a book every where you go? Yes you can this kindle downloaded on my iPad is the business, I mean you don't have to worry about losing your book or your page because it saves your page for you. I love it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|What else can be said about the Game of Thrones series that has already not been said.  This book is just as well written and immersive as the previous ones.  Spent every available minute of free time reading it and cannot wait for the next one to be released.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was captivated from the first few pages - I couldn't put it down! I felt like I knew these characters to their very core. I laughed, I cried, it was devastatingly beautiful.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|If you love SciFy, then you will enjoy Atlantis.<br />If you are a Stargate fan, you already know about it and probably seen it many times!!!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A great movie that will inspire all who see it unless you are totally in the dark.  Very good acting, some very funny laugh out loud scenes, and very moving tear producing scenes.  This is a very important movie that I encourage everyone to watch, and put the principles into daily practice.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie, it's not boring, but it is in depth and requires quite a bit of attention. If you watch it make, make sure that there are no distractions, because the movie may sometimes be hard to follow. But, your attention will be rewarded because it will strike a chord with you. I will definitely be purchasing the book.
B008MLNDEO|5.0|This score is beautifully composed. It pulls you into the movie and makes you feel like you're in it.<br />period
B008518MOW|3.0|I think the cost for 3d movies is still too high and this movies was just more of the same with a little twist in the plot.  The shipper got it to me on time and no issues with the sale.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Anything with Maggie Smith and this eclectic group of actors is worth my attention. Well done Dustin! worth owning and keeping!
B00DW5IKJI|3.0|an essential collection to me is a collection of all singles from an artist. this is almost essential but not all there. it is missing don't let me be the last to know, i was born to make you happy, someday i will understand , i love rock n roll (an international hit) oh la la and<br />the s&m remix with rihanna. also there are two songs that are not singles on the album and should not be included. being that it contains her most recent hits i will be purchasing this cd but a note to the record label stop releasing the same songs on multiple  hits packages.also, put the singles only and leave off the album tracks in the future.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Amazing book I can't wait for the third to be released. There were a few nights with little sleep because I just couldn't put the book down
B0018OFNHC|5.0|Looks great on Bluray! Crisp & clear picture! Sound is great... definitely worth purchasing!! Bluray is the way to go!!
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|If you are reading this review, you are probably a Stephen Stills fan.  I have not been, but instead have been a fan for years of Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and was surprised when I heard about these two plus Barry Goldberg getting together to form \\"The Rides\\".  What I can't understand is the trashing that iTunes gave for this cd.  Not real sure what music they were listening to, as I am listening to the cd for about the 7th time, and I am 100% satisfied with the purchase.<br /><br />I hope these guys stay together and give us some more music.  Especially liked \\"Don't Want Lies\\" and \\"Only Teardrops Fall\\".  Well worth the bargain price they put on the cd.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Get to fight villians and build and experiment with different armors.  Whole lot of fighting, dodging the enemy and no blood!
B00BMQTY3U|5.0|This album has the soul, feel, and muscianship of a late 60's to early 70's R&B band and was somehow recorded in 2011. The voice of James Brown, the free-flow feel of Baby Huey and the Babysitters, the drive of Booker T. & the MG's and the sound of the Memphis horns. This album is a must have if you enjoy R&B, Motown, STAX or just plain good instrumentalism (totally a word I just made up for this review). Buy this album if not for you then for the sake of the children!
B00AEFXJ86|5.0|The movie was in great shape as stated and it had no problem I hope that anyone that gets this is as happy as I am have a nice day.
B00CWM3F4C|3.0|When 'Alice in Chains' got back together no one was expecting the album to be anywhere near as good as previous works like 'Again' or 'Dirt' but it was really good. Each previous album has a sound and a feel with uptempo and lower tempo works on it and that over-driven guitar work like on 'Again'. This album has good music and vocals but nothing to distinguish the songs from one another. They all blend together and start to sound exactly the same as each other and as the songs from 'Black Gives Way to Blue'. If you really like 'Alice in Chains' then this is an album to purchase however if you are a casual fan and know them more from the 'Unplugged' album then you might want to step past this purchase.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Like all Angry Bird games this one is fun.  A lot easier than other titles.  Still I really liked it.

B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is so addicting but fun. I like trying to guess the title without  using the hints. It's great.if you like solving problems this game is for you.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Love all seasons of Fringe it is by far my favorite tv series. It's not just a syfy tv series but it is also a love story and family ties.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I bought this product to use with my new Asus Ultrabook. The new computer came with just 3 USB ports, all 3.0. By the time i plugged in an external HD and a wireless keyboard I was nearly out of slots. This now gives me 3 more usable USB slots. I don't have a lot of 3.0 devices, but it's nice to know I could use them as well. This worked perfectly out of the box. The short cable I think is a plus, thought I can see why others might find it limiting. I did have trouble with the wireless keyboard/mouse (Connectland cheapo version), but the instructions with the USB Hub warned that there might be issues, so there was no surprise.<br /><br />In all, I am very very happy with the performance of the hub, the price is fantastic and the short cable does not get in the way of anything.
B00008WT5C|5.0|This was my first vinyl, this album still rocks today! For all you kids growing up, you need to listen to this and have a history lesson!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|First of all, you must start with the first book in the Outlander series.  You simply cannot stop!  These characters become people you know like your own family members.  Jamie and Claire are the most realistic people I've ever had the joy to read about!  Gabaldon has an incredible imagination!  And you get a phenomenal history lesson too!  Get 'em all!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Love the kid part of the movie, exploring, finding and then the planning the adventure.  McConaughey is awesome as usual.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Been hearing more and more music from Joe Bonamassa on XM.  This is first CD purchased and we were very happy with it.  Will be purchasing more!  Just the &#34;rocking blues&#34; I like to listen to!
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|Software that I purchased and downloaded, or downloaded because it was free does not work.  They all give me a message that I did not purchase them and wont let me run them.  This is one of those pieces of software.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Very funny movie.  I can relate to a lot of stuff that is in it.  I know they show it on cable every Christmas but I want to be able to play it at my convenience.
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|Software that I purchased and downloaded, or downloaded because it was free does not work.  They all give me a message that I did not purchase them and wont let me run them.  This is one of those pieces of software.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|I have almost every Dr. Panda game out there. And this one is pretty decent. It's on par with the other Panda games like Restaurant and Doctor Panda clinic, but I think the most involved game in its series is the shopping one. Don't get me wrong this is a great game as well for the kids who already know of the Dr. Panda series of games but if you want a bit better one, go for the Supermarket one. I paid for this one when it initially came out. I am ok with that. In my opinion, if my 5 year old is ok with it, I am ok with it.
B004RCUJ9E|1.0|Software that I purchased and downloaded, or downloaded because it was free does not work.  They all give me a message that I did not purchase them and wont let me run them.  This is one of those pieces of software.
0765325950|5.0|Dear Fellow Readers,<br /><br />So I've been crying like a Tennessee sorority girl for the last half hour...<br /><br />I'm not afraid to say it was because I have just finished reading the final book of the Wheel Of Time series. Robert Jordan makes JRR look like an English schoolboy trying to please his 3rd grade creative writing teacher at prep school. Mein Gott! So powerful, and such an exquisite ending to a series that has taken the better part of fifteen years to finish.<br /><br />The series had to be completed posthumously by author Brandon Sanderson, who was able to do a meticulous job finishing the series using the extensive notes that Jordan made. When I say fantasy epic, it doesn't begin to describe the literary masterpiece that Jordan created.<br /><br />I started reading the series almost fifteen years ago, and ended up re-reading the published works again and again as i waited for new installments. The majesty of the epic showed me time and again how detailed and meticulous the series' creation was, as I discovered things I hadn't realized on my first second or third read through. Truly, I have had this wonderful world stewing in my brain since I read the first page of the first chapter of The Eye of the World. A world of powerful female characters, intrigue, emotion, shadow-spawned, darkfriends and more than a few moments where I unabashedly laughed out loud like a maniac wherever I happened to be reading at the time.<br /><br />After almost fifteen years of reading and rereading the installments, I sank into despair when I learned in 2007 of Robert Jordan's waking from the dream before the final two installments were completed. But there's always hope in the light. And as the dice spun wildly in my head I knew that somehow this gamble, immersing myself in this series heart and mind, would pay off.<br /><br />I must have the dark one's own luck, because I met his wife, Harriet McDougal (a lovely lady) at the New York Comic con not long after his deathin 2008. we hugged at the memory of her husband's influence and sheer awesomeness. and she assured me that the series was in good hands with Brandon. She left me feeling comforted that her husband's opus would be given the proper finale it deserved, nay, needed. You weren't whistling Dixie Harriet! Great job Brandon!<br /><br />If you know. You know. If you don't know... Then light! What are you waiting for! The books average only about 850 pages a piece, spread throughout fourteen books... that's a grand total of TWELVE THOUSAND pages, almost Four million words! I have to thank Dr. Koo, who happened to be reading A Crown Of Swords, back when I was just beginning my own epic journey as a punk assed teenager. It was both a blessing and a curse to wait with baited breath for each installment to be finished.<br /><br />Well, I'm finished. Emotionally drained after finally closing the book on a series that has taken almost half my life to complete. ...And I was just reading it! The ending is worth every moment and completes his vision perfectly.<br /><br />Tonight, I'm going to go grab a drink and toast the greatest author of our time... Two tours in Vietnam, where he earned a distinguished flying cross, and bronze star as a helicopter gunner. He wrote Conan the Barbarian better than it's creator did. He was a Nuclear engineer, an outspoken pillar of his community and simply; an all-around awesome human being. I wish our paths had crossed. But maybe they will good Sir, on the next turn of the Wheel. Tonight, Mr. Jordan, I'm drinking a few to you, I strive to live to your example. I can only hope to leave such a legacy of a fulfilled, and talented life behind me.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The author, an accomplished scholar of Jesus, writes with a clear, understandable voice.  Easy to read with as much or as little depth of learning that can appeal to anyone willing to look at their own religion with an open mind and an eagerness to learn things about the life and times of Jesus that were never taught in Sunday school. It has caused me many epiphanies so far.  If you appreciate &#34;aha&#34; moments you will enjoy this read.  I recommend you try the sample first to make certain you can read the book with an open mind.  I am enjoying it tremendously.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This was a very fun and refreshing game to play.  It calls for fast thinking and fast reactions.  I would definitely recommend this game.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Good listening
B00DM0XXCM|1.0|I very much enjoyed this movie. I did not enjoy renting it. It kept stopping every couple of minutes to load then went to the &#34;cannot play screen&#34; not sure exactly why. Also the quality was poor a bit blurry. my ping/upload/download speeds were adequate and there were no issues with my service provider in my area
B009GX69RK|5.0|Kick your feet up and start laughing. Not one problem with the stream or accessing it. Works perfect on your computer.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|I couldn't tell if the controls were entirely clumsy, the depth perception made it impossible to accurately know where your piece was going, or it was a combination of both things.  I would have been upset if I had payed for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is amazing addictive fun for all. the ont thing is it takes a long time to load but it is well worth it.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|It wasn't very challenging, but then again I'm 21 years old.  It didn't particularly seem like it was made for anyone above 14, but it was entertaining enough.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|I saw this with my kids when it first came out.  I like the point it makes about getting to know someone before you pass judgment.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Pudding Monsters has a very similar feel to cut the rope, but is different in basically every way.  I really enjoy that the player can decide what completion level they are going for and it increases the difficulty from level to level this way.  It makes it accessible to many audiences without plummeting the amount of draw it has for an older audience.  It has great replay value as well.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|im a  huge fan and i was going to college so i needed a compact and cheap set and this was perfect
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|It's a very fun game to play when you have a few minutes and nothing to do.  A fun mix of a crossword and sudoku, the game is challenging enough to keep you thinking, but not so difficult that you get frustrated or end up resorting to guesses.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Just want gems...ugh 20 word min dang it..just wanted the gems. Goo to get the most important thing is that the most important thing is to get the best possible freelance workers in this country
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was so good even thought the thought of this disease is so depressing. It chronicled what life with this awful disease would be like.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|I like this it makes you think about yourself and it seems to be the way I'm feeling when I'm reading them. I always like to look just to see what they say never thinking it's the way I'm actually feeling.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The story is as good or better than all the other Jack Reacher novels. I had great difficulty putting it down because I never knew when or how the next twist or turn would surprise me!
B008I43DYU|5.0|Very helpful, easy to  use great for on the road no need in hunting down a calculator  or if your out its handy right at Palm
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Not much to say other than I love the cd.  Lianne La Havas has a great voice.  I thoroughly enjoy listening to it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Having fun with this game. Great way to have fun with others . Buy also g for help without the need to make them up lol
1451673442|5.0|We all need to take time to be grateful for what we have but to often we get so busy that we don't take the time to stop and think about how fortunate we are...even for the small things in life.<br />This book is an easy read, and I am, yes, grateful to have it.  My life is better now that I am taking the time to appreciate everything and everyone in my life.  Life is good!  I highly recommend it.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Works great,  great buy,  money well spent, great sound helps add more beat,  base trebble to your music like the traffic equalizer
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love playing this game it's fun for all ages and very addicting and the cool thing is you don't have to unlock the different planet's so much fun
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Nice to use one less devices to carry around . Easy to use, easy to get to my music library to pick out other sounds to wake up to
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Put it on my Kindle because I was too lazy to dig out my paperback. Enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Being able to swear in lapin is a nice perk.
B00330UFQS|5.0|Great buy, like there music quick,  down load onto my kindle. This just a small list to start a music library
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Just happy that it's available-but I swear this edition is sharper than I remember. I watched it originally for Redford, but Sam Waterson's Nick Carraway is the reason I've watched this over and over, and wanted to have it in my collection.<br />The sets, the costumes, the music, every actor perfectly cast. This is a treat.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I love Marc Anthony as an artic and as a singer, he is the BEST. There is no other like him. I collect all his records. Excellent
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|If you are familiar with a Guy Clark Album, expect more greatness.<br /><br />If you are not, then, your life needs more enrichment . Study this mans' songs like they were a religious situation. Buy every album and you will be thoughtfully entertained. Your life will be better for it.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I view this classic once again just for the first 25 minutes or so to the moment of the activation of the Stargate. It never ceases to amaze me. The rest, is just a free exciting ride...
B000002RXS|5.0|Six years old (!!) I heard a neighbour girl sing the \\"Habanera\\". I can still remember how impressed I was and from this early age I knew I loved Carmen, and loved opera! Yes, I am a great admirer of Callas. But I can be critical when needed. I am not very found of her second Norma or her Cetra La Traviata - BUT this is my ideal Carmen. A Swedish wellknown critic once wrote (about this Carmen recording) that La Callas sang as she had a hot potatoe in her mouth.<br />However I think she sings the role in an excellent way and like no other is able to express Carmen as a truthful character. She IS Carmen. Gedda is excellent in one of his very best roles. If I had to chose one recording of Carmen only, this is it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love Cut the Rope! The look on the little guy's face when the candy misses his mouth is just precious! I have all the Angry Birds versions and love playing that, but I think I like this game more. It seems so simple when you first start playing, but you soon discover that you have to think about how the candy is going to swing as you cut the strings. Of course, they throw in barriers and traps and other hazards. I have only made it through the first season (of three seasons) so far, but really enjoy playing when I have the time. I've had no glitches with it, either. It's a cute game that anyone can play.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|helps me get sleep and while there are a couple options that i find to be sub par, there is a vast selection of great sounds to enjoy.
B00377V6J2|4.0|I loved seeing SRV improvise on the Albert King tracks here.  That alone warrants a four-star review as Stevie Ray is one of my all-time guitar favorites.  I'm not so impressed with King, though.  He shines on his tracks but when it comes time for him to play with Stevie's songs, he fumbles through a few things or stops playing entirely to TALK!  What?  I've often read that King had a hard time learning new material.  That's cool as his thing was more related to feel than to music theory, but I think it was in poor taste for him to distract us from Stevie's excellent playing when the session was getting away from him.  Stevie never complains and does his best to shine, as does King's wonderful backing band.  This session is a rare treat but one that could have been even sweeter.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|This app has so much potential (the iPhone/iPad version is pretty decent in comparison).<br />These comments are as of 8/28/2013 and subject to change.<br /><br />The Good: Good picture and Audio quality on the Kindle Fire(HD) with decent response-to-click ratio.  When it doesn't freeze up that is. This is probably the only redeeming value of this app at this time as just about everything else is problematic or overall \\"WTF were they thinking?\\" type of response. I gave 2 stars for the Picture/Audio quality when it works.<br /><br />The Bad: In no particular order.  No ability to log in.  You can't view your favorites, check on friends streams or even view them unless they are on the Featured/Browse Channels by chance or popularity. No Search feature so you can't go to someone's stream or view their profile.  Why either of these rather basic features are not added to this app is beyond me.  All in all, there are problems with this low grade poor quality App.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. I would compare it to Red 2 (REALLY?!) I have no more words for you at this time.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Written with complete access to its subject -- and all of his friends and enemies -- and with no pre-pub meddling, this book presents Jobs in all his pig-headed callousness, but also conveys the spiritual side of his nature and the way it fed into his Zen approach to tech design. A grand and unexpectedly inspiring bio...
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|Loved the story and it was well written and well told.  Joe really lets you peek into his head and live through the experience with him.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the AccuWeather app!  It's got more information than any other weather app I've looked at.  The graphics on the satellite maps are  colorful and well detailed which I really like.  Kudos to an awesome app!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game to keep your brain sharp, with just the right amount of difficulty. I couldn't stop playing!
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I love the Amazon app for my AGPtek tablet.  I can do everything on the app that I can do on the website.  I recommend it highly!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Like all good sci-fi, its just a futuristic story on top of a morality and sociology play.  Pages went by fast and the ending was quite a surprise.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Mud is a great coming of age type movie with surprisingly strong acting by some young newcomers. Matthew McCaughnehy shows a differrent side from his normal comedic characters and is excellent as the mysterious Mud.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|But really got going around the middle of the book.  What an open person to air her faults, fears, manias in a book.  It turned out to be a very entertaining read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I could hardly stop watching! I was sad when it was over. I am having a hard time finding another show I liked as well as this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a fascinating historical series. The best part of it is the intelligent dialogue. Not a word is wasted. The humor is subtle and clever. The drama is intense and edge-of-your-seat. The timing and pace of action are spot on.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This was the only place I could find this cd and glad I did - we love it! Thank you
B005IQZB14|5.0|WENT ON THE TRIP WITH HER.<br />BEAUTIFUL, SCENIC VISTAS.  MADE ME WANT TO START HIKING. ENJOYED THE BOOK VERY MUCH.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I thought this movie was really well done. It's too bad the advertising and marketing for it was so poor. A lot of people missed out on a fun ride. I was entertained the entire time, and that's saying a lot since most movies these days are about 20% fun 80% boredom. The visuals were great, the writing was above average, and it had enough action mixed with story to keep you interested. The set is a decent value at 14.99 as of this review for the combo. A bargain for yourself plus a gift for a friend, or if you just like having an extra copy to take on the road with a portable DVD player or in your vehicle then it's great too! I recommend the movie heartily and I hope we see a sequel sometime soon!
B0027MJU00|3.0|Since I have read other novels by Gillian Flynn and enjoyed them, I thought I would give this one a shot. Unfortunately, this was not one of the better ones. The biggest problem I had was it was really difficult to actually &#34;like&#34; any of the flawed characters in this book enough to want to empathize with them, or want them to have success. The storyline was engaging, the ultimately the full unveiling of what happened on the fateful night was interesting, but at the end, I did not feel any satisfaction, because the characters were just not really worthy of it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't believe that the network cancelled it.  Shame on them.  This has humor, old and sci-fi mixed together.  Sci-fibbing my favorite
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like this app because it gives me lots of different information and multiple locations.  Easy to<br />customize to your tastes.  Fun to watch the background.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really entertaining. It keeps you searching how to escape. I love it. All of the little puzzles are fun to figure out and it's great getting to the next room.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Grandson loves this movie!!watches it over and over and wants to have a minion bday party.very cute for adults too.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game! It has great graphic arts, a good story line, and it is also audio narrated! This game is worth it! Five star rating!
B0081336FO|5.0|Is the best TV series so far. I've been fan of Breaking Bad for quite some time but Sherlock really overcomes it.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I love the slings to keep my camera from resting on the lens.<br />The bottom is reinforced and you could actually rest the bag upright.<br />Has a carrying handle and a removable strap.<br />Has a decent amount of storage for cleaning kit and extra battery/memory cards.<br /><br />All for an excellent price!
B007BVOEPI|3.0|The actors are good and the setting has great possibilities, but thre is so much nudity and crass behavior it seems that is the whole purpose of the show.
0425263908|5.0|If you liked 50 Shades, you will love this book!  I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.  Get all three books in the series when you order, you won't want to wait for the others to read them!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Lots to look for great for insomniacs. Keeps you interested every level you complete. Great mystery Carnt wait for next level.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I believe the author gives the reader an idea of what a Seal and family sacrifices for the country!!<br />Thanks to all our men and women serving in our Armed Forces!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I have only used this machine for slides, and it works very well for that.  The digital image is not professional quality, but it is certainly good enough for me.  Many problems can be corrected by your photo editor.  In fact, I would have to say that the image on the computer is not as good as the original slide usually.  However, for me, the choice is between having not quite as good an image I can look at easily on my computer or a better image that I have to set up a projector and screen to see, which never seems to happen.  For me the trade off is quite acceptable and I'm happy with the quality.  I would buy this machine again, even knowing what I know now, and I still think it is worth five stars.<br /><br />The machine appears small and slightly cheap, but it does exactly what the promo says.  It is very easy to use and takes under 10 seconds per slide.<br /><br />Some observations: 1.  Vertical pictures must be put in horizontally, or parts will be cut off.  You can later use your photo editor to flip the pictures.  2.  You need a tweezers to remove slides from the machine.  3.  Keep a can of compressed air nearby to blow dust off the slides/machine.<br /><br />This is far and away the easiest and cheapest way I found to digitize my collection of 35mm slides.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's not very entertaining and too slow! With no instructions there's too much hunting and tapping to get to the next floor,
0316227706|5.0|This is a fun book, a unique idea to show dogs playing under water.  Most of them are chasing a ball but the unbridled ecstasy in their faces as they do so is a delight to observe. It shows how the simplest thing, like chasing a ball, can be the most fun.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really liked the characters in this book, I know that they are supposed to be children but they way they are portrayed makes it easy to relate to for most ages.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Must watch show never have I wanted to watch a show episode after episode with out stopping. Cannot wait for three to be on prime
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I never had the chance to go to a show on the Up All Night tour.  This DVD is a great glimpse into the concert atmosphere and I really love it.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I wish they would make another Stargate series, or at least wrap up this one with a movie.  Loved it!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Needed a memory card for an old ps2 I was given, this did the trick! Very happy with my purchase.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Loved it so much!!! I'm reading it over and over!  This is the best one yet besides the first. I just LOVE it!!! I heard there was a movie coming out. Totally 100% going to see it!! Please never end this. I could stop reading. I want more to it!!!
B0057B8PT0|5.0|I've always loved Olly and when I heard he had 2 albums available in the UK I was immediately interested! This is an amazing album and I thoroughly enjoy it.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Good plot, good execution in the story. But some of the actors leave much to be desired in the acting.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Please Amazon Correct the messed up copying tecniques that your typist use it's messing up these great books. Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Tons of fun, but a little tricky to get the hang of movement on a tablet. The minions are darling and just as funny as in the movie.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The first 700 pages drug, but the last 300 made up for everything. I have high expectations for the upcoming books.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very helpful sleep aid. I use it often and would recommend it to others. It works for me.<br />It features a many different sounds, so you can find the right one for you.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|This movie has that classic feel along with all the modern day movie making perks we enjoy today. Great plot, good character development.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I just loved this book -- have recommended it to many of my friends.  Hosseini can really tell an amazing story!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Tom cruise did some amazing acting. It has a little bit of plot twist but its a weird twist that doesn't necessarily enhance the movie. Also has a lack of a background story so if your looking for action and a weird ending go for it
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|The movie was faithful enough to the book to make it enjoyable for one who loves Austin.  Actors were well cast.  All around a good movie to watch with a cup of tea and a piece of needlework
B00A17AD36|3.0|The Trilogy isn't bad, but you have to be in the mood to listen the whole album. After about 4 songs they all start to sound the same, and his voice will start to annoy you if you're not in sultry/jaded mood.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|I can do a lot of things but I can't watch MKV movies like everyone says. I can't  &#34;Fling to&#34; a playlist, just a single song, even with Pro version.
B000MV90IU|4.0|We had an old VHS version of this movie.  It was such a pleasure to have the Blu Ray.  The picture is much improved.
B00EDF43MY|1.0|If you want your kid to grow up to be the best TSA agent that they can be, then this app's for you. PS absolutely nothing to do with being a doctor... lol like that matters.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|not muc to say about heat sinc even though im pretty sure that im not spelling that right. really...come on one more word.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book would read it over again loved it super suggested never stop reading right as your about to something exiting happens
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I loved it! They have some great actors and story lines for this show. I will definitely be watching more episodes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down...very interesting.  enjoyed how the chapters ended by making a reader continue on to the next chapter....quite exciting...
B00640UICA|5.0|I love this game. Even my wife who doesn't normally play puzzle games is hooked. If you have ever enjoyed a puzzle game before buy this one now.<br /><br />Every set of levels introduces a new challenging dynamic that keeps it from getting old.<br /><br />The graphics may look a little childish but the challenge is far from it. I think the style fits well with the theme of holding hands (or not in the case of the emo face).
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book was amazing!  And downloading it to my kindle made it so easy to read!  Would Highly recommend! And then go see the movie! ;)
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Love the set!  We had a blast putting it together and playing out the game as if we were online!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read with excitement after everyone on earth read it and raved.  I admit, it had my attention and it kept me turning the page.  Till the last 30-50 pages.  It seemed to me like Flynn gave up, got bored, or ran out of time to complete.  When I finished, I was angry I devoted the time.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|This is a really nice old school track; very catchy and disco-like. I'm sure the CD will be a hit.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Great music with a &#34;back up band&#34; to die for. Get the DVD, usually not into the videos of music but this one is a must have.
B0081336FO|5.0|I really love this show and wish they already had more episodes out to watch. Great stories, great acting- not at all predictable. Five stars!!
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Great album! Selena is fantastic and always changing it up! I can't wait to see her perform in concert this year!
B0041KYLAU|1.0|I PUT THE PURCHASED 'MARY POPPINS' DVD INTO THE DVD PLAYER & IT DOESN'T PLAY.  THERE WAS NO PACKING SLIP INCLUDED WITH ADDRESS OR CONTACT INFO. I PAID GOOD MONEY AND RECEIVED NOTHING. I FEEL I WAS ROYALLY SCAMMED & WILL NOT PURCHASE THRU AMAZON.COM AGAIN.<br />I BOUGHT THIS DVD TO ENJOY WITH MY YOUNG GRANDDAUGHTER.  WE HAD A SPECIAL MOVIE NIGHT PLANNED. WELL, WE DIDN'T WATCH 'MARY POPPINS' FOR SURE.  HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED :-/
B000001EHS|5.0|Never owned a Def Leppard cd til now. This is a good compilation of most of their great songs. Worth the price.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|Time to quit!!!! Not all the car chases, car wrecks, and shooting in the world could save this movie!!!!!!  YAWN-YAWN-YAWN.  I actually turned the movie off before it ended because I was falling asleep.  I actually thought the original DIE HARD was a great movie, and I am a Bruce Willis fan.  However it is time to bury John McClaine if this movie is any indication of the story-line quality we can expect in the future.  I do not understand why movie studios don't know when to \\"give it up\\". C.G. quality cannot make up for a lame script.  The studios are going to have to realize that there are some of us that require something more than blowing things up to entertain us.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I love STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS. But, the one * rating is because Paramount has removed the usual extras that appear on a high profile film like this and divided them up between the digital and brick and mortar retailers. BestBuy has certain special features as does Target, Wal-mart, iTunes, Vudu, etc. Each of those retailers have \\"exclusive\\" content specific to their brand. The problem with their \\"exclusive\\" content is that it was produced for THIS blu-ray release. That's right! The extras produced for this blu-ray (yet, do not appear on it) have been given away as \\"exclusives\\" to retailers. And that's not the worst part. The biggest \\"screw you\\" from Paramount farming the extras? The commentary by director JJ Abrams and crew is only available as an iTunes extra. BE WARNED! If you buy this blu-ray/DVD, you will only get 40 minutes of EPK (electronic press kit) interviews and the film. That is all. To get all the extras intended for this release, you'd need to spend about $85.00 across several different retailers. That, people, is bull-plop. I suggest not purchasing this title till Paramount releases the \\"Exclusive, Double-Dip Director's Commemorative Limited Edition\\" sometime in the future. Probably around Christmas.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Bought a new car, without bluetooth, that I had been used to. The sound quality is better on this than a factory installed system. Great size and great quality for the price.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I am a big fan of the walking dead series. This is one of the 1st comics I have read and I really enjoyed it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|While I appreciate the author's historic research, and while it is interesting to know some extra-biblical facts about Jesus, when he calls much of the New Testament \\"pure fiction\\" I've read enough at that point. He doesn't know the Jesus I know.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's a good game. Something else to kill the time. I enjoy the different animals and dinos. I really like it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was a very good game. I recommend it. You will stay up all night playing it. Can get a tad difficult, hints really help
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Classic and great entertainment! I didn't realize how much I had missed that until Downton Abbey arrived! I can barely wait until Season 4 arrives!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Accurate portrayal of the times and issues confronting the main characters. Easy reading and storytelling<br />follows historical timelines and details well.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The game is enjoyable and I have not had any issues with the application itself. Overall great version of mahjong tiles with a slight spin off of angry birds with the levels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging and fun. I really had to think on some levels and got stuck a few times. Would definitely keep playing
B005T87QCI|5.0|I have 5 boys and they all love this game they say its so cool and awesome they kill my kindle everytime they play this game and they have fun
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The game looks cool. But Its super slow and only the tutorial is free. Other words you'll have to pay like 9.99$ for the actual game. Advertised as free but actually isn't.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|A friend had this album and I first heard it while at sea...within the first 30 seconds I was hooked and couldn't wait to get back to land so I could order a copy.  This is great music, a perfect combination of good lyrics and addictive rhythm.  Do yourself a favor and get this album!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is one of the best books I ever read. It's very interesting, suspenseful,and has a very surprising ending. I am looking forward to reading the sequel.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Do not go one on one with a tsunami. They are way stronger than you will ever be. Obi Wan couldn't stop a tsunami. The tsunami takes his kids!
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's your typical weather app... accurate some days not the next. Other than that, great app. Couldn't ask for anything better.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|Makes you look closer at the art and remember which items make a piece worth buying or bidding on. Great introduction to art for kids.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|Movie was fine as far as I saw it but kept freezing until it stopped completely. Constant problem with PRIME
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I just really enjoy this show. I have learned the people and the time period are my favs..It took<br />a while to really get into it but now that I have I just have a hard time waiting for the next episode!<br />I feel like I am part of the family....
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I took a brief hiatus from Patricia Cornwell's books, but enjoyed getting back to read a new story about Scarpetta.  Pretty much like her stories always are, entertaining and engaging.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book as I did all the books from the Hunger Games.  I always hate when a good  book ends.
125000098X|3.0|After reading the disappointing reviews I feel I want to stop here and now on disc 4.  I will probably continue on but but but..............
B003O86FMW|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book and all of the books about the Hunger Games.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book.  It is just so smart, beautifully written and well crafted. Not the lowest common denominator type of read.  It takes effort but 100x well worth it!
0385341008|5.0|I have to admit it took me a few pages to get a feel for the unique style of the book but once I did - I was totally enthralled. It was a quick read -  heart-warming and yet sad too when you learn about the German Occupation on the island during World War II. I learned a lot about Guernsey that I would not have known otherwise. Such a unique love story between Juliet and Dawsey too - I wanted to know more about them! I would definitely recommend this book for fans of historical fiction/romance.
B001RHOJSE|5.0|Brialliant.  Given when the book was written, it is timeless and a constant reminder to us all of the potential both good and bad in all of us.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|While I have not completely finished the book, I find it both entertaining and irritating.  While the book is somewhat uneven, the material is fascinating.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|Not easy to identify or sympathize with - pretty people are a dime a dozen. If well researched (and I don't have expertise to judge) it could make for historically interesting viewing.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Forget all the witches, monster, supernatural, evil spirits, serial killer movies.  This is what suspense, scary movies should be like.  You don't even see the evil shark in most scenes, but the music and camera use scare you enough.  Saw it at the movie theaters in the 70's, saw it again in Blu-Ray.  I Still won't go in the water.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. I loved the characters and how real they seemed. The story spans the past and present  and I found myself drawn in and emotionally attached to each event and each character. A book that uncovers a young woman's secrets, The House at Riverton will draw you in and you won't be able to put it down.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Well written, heart grabbing real story.......I've been to the 70 West Bridge in Hot Springs and many local sites described in the book.  Adam Brown was an exceptional man!
0321934318|4.0|This is the 5th book of his that I have bought about Lightroom.  Also, a number of his Elements books.  Enjoy reading them.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|So far so good with this case.  I have dropped my iphone several times and no problem.  I haven't managed to get it wet yet and hope I don't but I suspect it will be fine!  And it's a lot less bulky than an otterbox.  LOVE IT!
B0086DBE62|3.0|Good girls night-in movie with chocolate popcorn, great family movie. Love Julia Robers and she does a fantastic job. Thumbs up.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|There isn't much to say here, if you've made it all the way to Season Seven, you have done so because you enjoy the show and cast and storyline in some way, shape and form. this season is much like the rest, and highly enjoyable.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love using Kindle to read. But recently, I've started running into problems. About once a week, the app will freeze, and give me a black screen. So I have to uninstall it, then reinstall it. This current time, I can't get my device to register that its not on it anymore, despite having cleared/reset everything. I'm going into book withdrawls!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I cried at one point and was laughing the next, this book was great and really touched me. I'm glad my school made me read this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really made me think!!! Well worth giving it a try!  I got a little stumped On the last level but I figured it out- good game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a really good, fun and addicting game that is great for everyone.its a game you wil love.not literally of course.  =)
B008ALAHA4|4.0|A great alternative to replacing all of my old power supplies, but I wish there were a hole where I could attach a tether of some kind.  They're easy to lose if you move them around.
0345529057|5.0|amazing！at first，I just watch the TV series on HBO，then I thought the book should also be perfect，so I bought one，it's really amazing！
B008NMT684|4.0|This is a fun and colorful game with big bright pictures and easy shapes for a 3yr old to play.  Of course, in order to play the full game it requires a purchase. Really, why not say that at the beginning?!  Well of course I paid the .99 cents, but why not just say so.
B0002HZHXG|4.0|The lights/sound were very easy to install and not terribly loud. my grandson really liked this added feature.  would recommend to others.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this story of life. I couldn't  put it down. Now I wonder what ever will happen to Molly.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|The acting in this movie is superior. It has a powerful plot that reveals the culture of the poor who live on the gulf. The two boys who take the lead in the story are remarkable actors.
B003ZD9DYI|5.0|Always been a Mayer fan so I'm biased. He's a living legend as long as you judge him by his craft. This is a great deal with the DVD!
B000IDEQTK|5.0|This was a total surprise movie for me.  It was perfect for a rainy day afternoon and for all audiences.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Not just another average action flick. Good story line, and action scenes. Definitely worth watching =) Good movie, clever story.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I have only watched a few of the episodes but I have enjoyed and look forward to catching up on all episodes.  I like science fiction and most of the books as well as TV seems to be fantasy.  Not so fond of fantasy.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I bought this book, despite several reviews saying Piper came across as a little full of herself. I did not find this to be the case at all - she wrote from her perspective, with details on herself and her life. She came across as honest, embarrassed, and willing to own up to her mistakes. Yes, she's an attractive, middle-class blond woman, sent to jail. Her story is from the point of view of an attractive, blond, middle-class woman in jail.<br />After reading the book, I started watching the series on NetFlix - it strays quite a bit from the book, but I watched the whole season in 2 days, so it's obvious I loved that as well!
B001LMAK88|5.0|Silverado is the quintessential western.  It's a work of art.  If you own only one western movie this should be it.
0451232852|5.0|Historical fiction is my favorite genre and I believe that the Fall of Giants by Ken Follett cannot be surpassed in that regard.  Through the dialogue and experiences of his fictional characters - a handsome priggish English earl; his feminist sister and aristocratic Russian wife; an intelligent, sensitive German intellectual; a determined Welch coal miner and his spirited sister, two Russian peasant brothers, and others -- the gripping story of WW I is told.<br /><br />Why on earth this terrible war was fought was explained in a fascinating dialogue at a dinner party.  The impact of this technique is extremely powerful, as I, the reader, was able to feel the emotions of the various characters as they revealed their knowledge or opinions and then listened to comments of others.<br /><br />Of course, there are many unbelievable coincidences -- such as the Russian brothers' tragic encounter at a young age with the earl's Russian wife, but Follet was not writing a novel about credible lives of individuals.  Rather, each character represented other people who shared his nationality and social class.  Two examples, the earl's Russian wife is killed by a mob and the German officer lives in poverty after the war.  That is what happened to those kinds of people.<br /><br />The book is very long but Follet's storytelling skills are so compelling I didn't want the book to end.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|Quite a thriller, but also good theology.  Yes there is evil, but it is never outside the control of God.  In fact He uses it to produce a higher good.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Read this to my daughter at bedtime.<br />She would inevitably drift off, but always seemed to remember everything up to the bookmark.<br /><br />Mrs. Stead - please steady yourself for the weight of others to stand on your shoulders.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MineCraft is  well thought out game. The kids and adults love this one.  Inspires their creativity and while honing their gaming skills. Kudos to the creators of this one. Grandsons are obsessed with it.
B00A285OOW|4.0|The book was ok...I found it quite repetitive and not as good as the other books in the series.<br />I'm disappointed that she didn't do more with the Margaret Beaufort and Jasper Tudor aspect of the story.<br />I think it could have been about 100 pages shorter
B005LAIIJY|5.0|If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, you'll love this movie.  If he's a bit too violent for you, you still might like this one.  This is more light-hearted and fun than most of his movies.  The real reason I wanted to buy this movie was for the lovable, supporting character, Dr. Shultz.  His character is so well-written, and funny, he makes this movie!  Of course, Quentin Tarantino can't let the movie stay happy and fun throughout.  Some of the more violent scenes are gruesome, and incredibly sad.  But overall, this movie is definitely worth watching.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|I saw the original Broadway production of Les Miserables, and have several versions of the musical. I enjoy this CD because of the many \\"extras\\" included. One of my faves, and even my daughter enjoys listening!
B00A285OOW|2.0|I have enjoyed all of Philla Gregory's books, but this one was dismal. All low points and no high points. Too much repetition as well. Tragedies and suffering can be inspiring, but this book fell short.
B000I9S64U|5.0|needed to have my dune fix, this is your brain on dune. yumm.<br />yummy, yummy, yummy, a little spittle on your face.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This season keeps you going.  I really like the characters and story lines.  On to watch season 3.  I dont like it on TV as much as I like watching it here.
B001GUXJQA|2.0|I've read about a half dozen Connelly books and I struggled to get through this one. I still have about 50 pages to go and in no hurry to finish I came here to see what others thought about it and I am astounded at the great reviews! IT was a bore so I am not sure what book everyone else is reading. Glad to see I'm not alone in thinking this, and to anyone thinking of reading it I say skip it. There are better Connelly novels out there, like The POET -- read that instead!
B002APU580|5.0|This  movie corresponds well with the book, which to me is one of the most important qualities of any book-based motion picture.  Every one of the cast represents their part faithfully and with obvious enthusiasm--and the homes and mansions used are amazing.  I would recommend reading the book first before seeing the movie--to me it brings the imagined characters much more into focus.  The casting was done to perfection--as always, Kiera Knightley is superb in her role, as are Matthew McFadyen and the  entire cast.  There are no &#34;dull&#34; moments in this period romance.  This is one of the most entertaining,  enjoyable movies I have seen in a very long time.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Thankfully, I didn't buy this book as I would have been returning it! I like a good romance - 'good' being the operative word. This book is extremely predictable and following the old worn pattern of boy meets girl (in this case, boy marries girl <girl doesn't even remember...>), boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. I'd feel bad about revealing the plot line there but, let's face it, it's been done.<br /><br />The one thing this book did for me was convince me that I can write a better tale. I'd at least throw in some sort of interesting twist. If you like romance, try The Thornbirds. Excellently written and a story line that rivals none other.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Over all entertaining.  The story line is a little hard to follow, but I believe the writers intended it to be.  Somewhat suspenceful with an interesting conclusion.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Wish it were a longer game with more levels! Clues were awesome! The story line lost me a little bit though.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I love the extended scenes . It definitely makes the story way better . I would recommend it to anyone to watch .
B00499QUK2|5.0|Really!  This show is fabulous!  I can't believe I have only now been introduced to it.  I'm hoping they will continue the series!
B000FC130E|5.0|In interesting story of one man's awakening to the meaning of life, through a dreamlike adventure through the forgotten &#34;underground&#34; and back alleys of London.
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|Boring, slow, contrived. Excellent performance by McConaughey but the script lacked substance and left too many loose ends. The movie itself lost focus about 30 minutes in and never got back on track. A disappointment unfortunately.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome! It challenges the player and it is a dear reader at the same time. Hope to get new levels soon.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Great SciFi movie and beautiful cinematography.  Not a fan of Tom Cruise but he does pick great movies to be involved in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I found the game to be almost as enjoyable as the movie. Fun to play, but challenging as well! Love it!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|So addicting! It pulled me in from episode one.  Funny, dramatic and you root for the main characters.  Love it!
B0061QD82E|5.0|Disney Studios 15th full length animated feature film may seem like a step back on the surface, but Lady and the Tramp is another quality Disney film and the first to be produced in CinemaScope. Considering this was released at the height of the studios resurgence, it does seem a little ordinary when compared with the animated full length feature films that came before it.<br /><br />The film looks amazing on Blu Ray and the colors pop even more on this sparkling Blu Ray treatment than ever before. The extras carried over are very good, but the new features are nothing all that impressive, probably lack of material is likely the culprit. A terrible practice by Disney is to drop art galleries from the previous releases and there is no reason to lose any bonus features in the place of others here. Not carrying over the old games etc. is understandable, but the art galleries are interesting and take up very little space. The film is presented in its original theatrical format CinemaScope.<br /><br />Still the film has never looked or sounded better and there are some quality bonus features on this set. Overall this is a very satisfying release. The story is simple and the animation is classic Disney.<br /><br />If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I loved it when I first downloaded it. No crashes, freezing..my newsfeed was current and messages came through without delays.<br />However the last week I continue to get a message that says I am using an outdated version that will cause it to be slow...<br />I went to the app store noticed it had an upgrade on the app button..I installed the upgrade..and still I got this is an outdated version.<br />The app is now not loading the news feed at times..my notifications won't load.<br />I tried an uninstall then reinstall...same results..this is a outdated version.<br />If you clink on link to upgrade the version..it takes you to the Google play app store...big help!! :/
0684824906|5.0|Seen the movie Lincoln, and look forward to learn more about Abraham's day's in Office and his relationship with his cabinet officials.<br /><br />I have never read anything from Goodwin but have see her in interviews. Excited!<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ed
B0001WGDX0|2.0|the cd3 incorrectly lists symphony 6 but the actual recording is symphony # 8. symphony # 8 is also on cd 4.<br />everything else seems ok<br />how do I get a copy of Symphony # 6??
B004XNGKBS|5.0|Easy to use, everything you need to to excellent notes or stories. I highly recommended this app. I haven't personally had any issues whatsoever.
B00ADLCC9I|5.0|The Good:<br />- Nice buttons with a good &#34;click&#34; to them.  Feels very &#34;old-school&#34;.<br />- Great button mapping tool makes it work with damn near any game.<br />- MicroSD card slot - so it can hold a lot of videos and games.<br /><br />The Average:<br />- The screen isn't the highest resolution compared to other Android tablets (such as Nexus 7).<br />- The viewing angle isn't that great.<br />- Though neither of those detract from gaming experience at all.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Battery life isn't great.  Maybe 4 hours of game-play.  Tops.  Which works great for me (as I don't have 4 straight hours to play games on the go)... but worth noting for those that are looking for 8+ hour gaming sessions on a plane or something.<br /><br />Overall:<br />- Love it.  For the price, this is currently the best &#34;bang-for-the-buck&#34; mobile gaming device on the market.  Especially if you like Android games or retro emulators.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book and is every inspiring to me to appreciate what we have and what life could be like without having men like him.
B0044IABFS|5.0|Season 4 continues to do what it did in the first three seasons which is continue to surprise the audience during every thrilling episode.  I loved the characters and the show does an amazing job of making us like the villains.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|This CD shows Phillip Phillips talent, nice CD and very glad I purchased.  We enjoyed him on American Idol.  Nice.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I am behind the times and just started watching this series. It was worth the wait! The story line is \\"au current\\" and therefore, keeps the viewer riveted. Can't wait to watch season 2 and 3.
B001P06GX4|4.0|This is a great game for the family, but after playing it two or three times, my family (8yr old girl, 12 yr old boy, husband and I) no longer play it.  Our 6 yr old, who is autistic, loves it though.  It's a great game for learning strategy, playing with shapes, and it's so versatile.  You should check out the ways people use this game on YouTube...from tetris-like (without the disappearing lines if you're playing it real-time), to making stories, to battling etc.  My 6 yr old is now on his 4th set because he kept losing pieces on the others (because he brings it with him everywhere - beach, restaurant, airplane rides, concerts, etc.  I do wish they only sold the pieces to replace missing ones, but they don't.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is fabulous because it does not insult the intelligence of its viewers. The story evolves during provocative historical times thereby catching the viewers attention not only through the characters' trials and tribulations but also through the societal challenges that they face. It is an addicting presentation as you live to find out what happens next to these most intersting people. Enjoy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an enthralling show, fabulous scenery, historically interesting time and a wonderful cast.  Top quality.  It arrived at lightning speed at a reasonable price as well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was definitely a moving story with laughs and tears. It was relatable to me in many ways which may be why I enjoyed it so much. Either way, it's a great tale about love, life, and loss.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I am a big British history movie fan and enjoyed this version - except that the nudity and sexual scenes approached soft porn and thus not tasteful, in my view.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Now handling into my smart phone, my pc, my tablet and for sure my kindle!! I will recomen this a lot.
