B0091REZMW|1.0|nice so far. no complaints seems to be worth a little bit of my time. not much else to say
B008GOKZ52|4.0|When you pick up albums that for some reason are missing from your catalog, you oftentimes get recommendations about other music you &#34;might&#34; like.  Well, this band is one recommendation that I was glad I gave a listen to!  Carrying on with the styles of great bands like Shellac, Cop Shoot Cop, The Jesus Lizard and others, Slint provides an awesome listen the first time you hear them.  Hell, I was sold just from hearing the clips!  I don't know how these guys were under my radar for so long, but I'm happy to be able to enjoy their limited time together.  Highly recommended!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app makes it easy for me to keep organized throughout my day.  I can put a note into my desk top and it syncs over all of my devices.  I recommend this to anyone who needs to stay organized throughout the day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!! My all time favorite. Kept me wondering what was gonna happen next! And oh was it exciting!!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This story really does a great job in giving you glimpses of the world of scouting and has several good acting roles.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have just recently discovered these guys on youtube and I can not get enough.  This cd is high quality and the music is great.
1451668945|3.0|I've been reading Mary Higgins Clark books since I was a teenager, and I'm a huge fan. However, I'm not sure what to think about her latest book.<br /><br />It's hard to summarize the plot because there are several different story lines/threads/back stories that are woven together for a great plot. I liked all of the characters. Most are typical MHC....strong women who figure things out with the help of a few great guys.<br /><br />Yet, something was a little off with the story. I don't know if it a few spots where the writing seemed off or that there wasn't a whole lot of action. It just didn't grip me  like most MHC books have in the past.<br /><br />So, I enjoyed it. I liked the idea of several different people's lives being woven together. It just wasn't as good as I expect from The Queen of Suspense.
B00992CF6W|5.0|they have armorand all of the best stuff like the computer. but that is not all you can get zombie pigman. JUST GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|No lawyers this time.  For those that are weary of &#34;another law&#34; story from Grisham, this one is completely different and has a surprising ending.
B004UID2LC|4.0|idk why everyone thinks this app sucks. I mean at first it doesn't open up then after a while, you get use to it. so its a good app, just neesds some update or etc.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This show is great but I get so annoyed with Amazon's streaming service.  Constant interruptions due to Amazon not having adequate bandwith I guess.  Hulu, neltflix and other work GREAT but amazon streaming is HORRIBLE.  If I were HBO or AMC or  other network I would be angry about the poor service.  Amazon is ruining streaming TV.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I don't read a lot of biography.  This one has had so much press you probably already know the story.  But it's a great read and quick too.  Jobs is a subject who gives you a lot of good material to work with.  Recommended but not extraordinary.  Thanks Walter.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I loved everything about it. It was so awesome same for the other two seasons. Loved it soooo much. The songs were amazing performed too perfection as well as the acting.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Would love to see it have a few more features, but still very cute.. everyone gets a laugh from it..
B00942G4UA|5.0|This was so eye opening.  I didn't realize there were so few players in the meat industry and though I had heard rumors of the animal abuse I had never seen it.  We have slowly been switching our families diet to a whole food plant based one and this just sped that conversion up.  Though I don't envision ever being vegan we are going to greatly reduce the amount of animal products consumed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was both challenging and beautiful.  I want more.  The atmospheric music lent a depth to the game that brought me in deeper.  I couldn't put it down.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|I enjoyed watching this with the kids.  This really kept their attention for the entire movie.  Can't go wrong with Robin Williams!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tiny Fey's outlook on life hits home with me and I love her sense of humor. Four more words required.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|What a fascinating read. This was a topic that I had been interested in for some time and this made for a wonderful starting point. If nothing else you will be much more aware of the world around you and you will get to observe some amazing interactions.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and has plenty of good examples contained within as well. Once you start reading you will notice the body language described in the book occuring around you all the time. As the author states, there is no definitive 'tell' associated with each body movement but it can certainly provide pointers.<br /><br />Now that I have finished the book I realise that to get the most out of it I will likely need to read it at least once more - which is no problem. My reasoning is that to recognise the characteristics and assess them you will want to be able to do it off the top of your head which requires practice and time. It's a textbook and not a novel. If you are expecting to read the '3 tells that guarantee you to know if a person is lying' then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />As I say - interesting stuff and I hope for me a starting point to build my knowledge in this area and other facets of psychology.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|very fun game! replayability is high! zombie plauge is very intertaning but they also have several other plagues that r cool also
B001W2D4XA|3.0|If you want to hear Neil Young singing strained and off-key in a drunken stupor, then this album is for you.
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|HESHER. Is a MUST SEE movie. It stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt (crazy awesome), Devin Brochu (holy crap balls), Rainn Wilson (do different from The Office), Piper Laurie (made me cry), and Natalie Portman (I just love her!) I would call it a dark comedy. HESHER definitely takes you on a roller coaster of emotions. YES. I cried. There's some deep stuff in this movie people. Everyone's performances - on point! Just watch the damn movie.<br /><br />I give HESHER... 5 out of popcorns!
0446615625|5.0|He is my favorite Author!  This was one of his best but I have read all of the kindle books available for him
B006P0FIGU|3.0|I liked this one. It has a cool cast and the special effects were dope. I'm not really sure how the 3D was since I watched it on DVD. Anyone know? (lol) Definitely action packed and worth the watch.<br />I give THE THREE MUSKETEERS... 3 out of 5 popcorns!
0307956350|5.0|Expats by Chris Pavone is a book you cannot put down.  I am a fan of Peter James, Robert Ludlum and Scott Mariani's Ben Hope series and this is as good if not BETTER than anything by these fabulous authors.  I was reading this book by coincidence whilst holidaying in Paris and could not put it down!!  If you like to loose yourself in a fabulous, amazing, can't put it down book you MUST read this!!!  I have never provided a review to a book until I read this[[ASIN:0770435726 The Expats: A Novel]]. ISBN978-0571-27918-0 if you are looking for a great read.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|Wow, I read this book in one day and I couldn't put it down. So worth the read. I especially love the ending for providing a bit of hope.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book I've read in a while. Made me cry which I don't like but that just means it was written well and I connected with the characters. I loved the chemistry between Sky and Holder. I would definitely recommend this book.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Joss Whedon knows how to create a great story, and the actors are perfect.  I highly recommend this sci-fi to science fiction fans.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I hope Paul Rudd never tries to act again. Stupid does not begin to describe this sham of a movie. Do not rent.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is good to fine tune your chess skills, and just to play a game at your level, or set the settings to difficult, and get your butt kicked by a Kindle...<br />George;
B00B2270P8|5.0|I have both versions of this movie and like this one better.  The extras are not lengthy be they are a nice addition to the movie.  I am glad they released this version.  It is worth the money.  I watch it often.
B005HSL626|5.0|This one has been around a while, and needs to have something added to it to change it up a little..<br />GEORGE;
B007Z9QY1S|5.0|I like the way they entwine the lives of both couples in this movie.  I have always been interested in the story of Edward and Wallace.  It does go into the trouble that they had because of their love for each other.  It also shows the good times they had.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Distant Hours is a beautiful story and Kate Morton is a great storyteller.<br />A Kindle download and of course it was available in 30 seconds!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I did not watch this show when it was on TV but now I am glad that I have a chance to watch it on Amazon.  It is a good show and the the actors are great.  I am waiting for Season 4 to become available on Prime.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is cute but so hard to get diffrent stones. But a cute game to pass the time when I am board.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Enjoy this game very much. Very addicting. Would recommend to my friends and family. Just wish the tokens were a little cheaper and easier to get.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|I let my grandson put this game on to pass the time when I was busy and couldn't play with him right at that time.
B007XF0X16|5.0|I watched this on cable and it was incredible now i have it on blue.and now i can watch it anytime i want.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I like this game but I do not like it where I have to personally buy things to play. I really is a very cute game just hate to feel like I need to spend money I don't have.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very entertaining read with a lot of John Corey funny comments! If you read enough of stories with John Corey you realize that he always follows his guy and is right!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I have enjoyed this game for something to do when I am not busy. Kind of fun to go out hunting in the wilderness.
B00A429YF6|5.0|It's one of our favorite movies we really enjoyed it we actually stop by and had a cup of coffee at the Baghdad Café on Route 66 it was fun and worth..
B009GED3HS|5.0|It is how I met your mother... So naturally, it's awesome...even legen-wait-for-it-dary! I definitely do not regret buying this at all.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|My husband, who dislikes reading anything, couldn't put this one down. He even recommended it to our ex-marine son as something he would like to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is the best game I have ever played on because you can upgrade it to different versions of it and I have lots of  fun doing them and collecting all the mystery boxes and the coins so I will never delete it because it is fabulous and people always tell me to upgrade it  and when they tell me I upgrade it straight away then I try it out and if it is boring I don´t play on it until there is another upgrade then I try that one out and I do the same if it is boring bit I hardly do that anyway because there all good so there is no point in saying that so good bye
B002IEVZFK|1.0|I can still remember buying this album a few years ago, and then throwing it away about a few months later. I tried and I tried and I TRIED to be able to appreciate this album, but it was just getting too boring, too fast. More importantly, I am completely fed up with those people who call this music &#34;metal&#34; whereas it is really metalCORE, which, in essentials, is just hardcore punk with metal influence. That being said, I have now finally considered it a priority to throw in my two cents.<br /><br />As I see it, Phil Labonte fails to convey an adequate amount of edge or angst, especially for music that some may consider to be &#34;heavy&#34; by any standards. When he is not merely screaming his lungs out like a toddler having a tantrum, he just sounds like nothing more than a boy-band singer. I would describe him as a louder version of Chester Bennington from Linkin Park. On top of that, the drumming and guitar work may be somewhat okay, but as much as others may be able to appreciate it, I myself cannot help but feel as though it does not carry the emotion of the songs nearly as much as it could. Simply put, I just find the music on this album, as well as the band themselves to be much too simplistic for my liking, but someone has to love it, and I have no problem with that.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong, I am not criticizing this band for the fact that they are &#34;not real metal,&#34; but for the sole fact that I bought this album, gave it a try, and decided that it does not do anything for me. Heck, there are bands that I enjoy that are not metal, despite being called &#34;metal&#34; by a number of their fans, i.e. Godsmack, Disturbed or Mushroomhead. ATR are what they are, and if you like them, then who am I to tell you not to like them, or the metalcore genre in general? Heck, I bet anything that this band is not even trying to be an actual metal band. Do I have a problem with that? No! I just find that their style does nothing for me. Simple as that. Personally, I much prefer bands like Dark Tranquillity, Insomnium, Firewind, Sonata Arctica or Mindwarp Chamber to give but a few of so many examples.<br /><br />To the fans of this band - I think it is awesome that you like this band and enjoy their music, but DO NOT proclaim that they are actual metal, because they are not. For those of you who enjoy ATR, but already know enough to know what is metal and what is not, you have my fullest respect. Thank you all for your understanding. PEACE! \m/\m/t.

B000NJWMYU|4.0|the only problem with the movie is, if you haven't read the book, you just won't ''get it'', but, it's good!
B00AEFYKWU|5.0|This is a great movie.<br />This movie will turn a good TV night to a great movie night. Have watched it 3 times since buying<br /> I recommend this to anyone who likes baseball or just a good time.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I have watched this documentary 4 times and I recommend it to all my friends to watch. Very informative and eye opening. It will change the way you buy food. It is done in a way that is tasteful and not gruesome. Watch it!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|First I would like to mention that I adored the structure and pace of the book, even though I found it interesting the choice of the countries he included. There were many instances where I was literally on the edge of my seat. Great read, even though I don't know if I will be able to bear it another time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|At the end of the day, a book is supposed to entertain and the author achieved that.  I didn't have a problem with the beginning.  I was amused by Nick's voice and to counter that with diary entries was an interesting choice.  And yet at the first hints that Nick may be guilty of this crime started dripping through, I started flipping the pages faster.  Then I hit the 50% mark on the Kindle and the author snatch the rug out from under me and I was left suspended in the air for the next 40%.  It's that last 10% that has me knocking a star off my review.  What kind of ending was that?  How anti-climatic.  How disappointing.  But I guess the ride was good while it lasted.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I love this story.  The author captured me in the first page and held me throughout. The atmosphere of this story is wonderful, I hated for it to end. Character development is superb, rich and very intriguing characters populate the story as it unfolds.  I won't provide a thumbnail of the book, as others have done fine jobs of that here. I was amazed that this was the author's first book, and I periodically look to see if she has published any since.  One thing I liked about the story was the timeless setting.  There is nothing to place it in any particular decade. There are telephones, cars, and cameras, so you know it is after 1900, but it could be today.  I bought this when it first came out in paperback, 6 years or so ago. Now that it is a Kindle special I bought it for my Kindle too. I know I will re-read this again, maybe very soon. Diane Setterfield did a great job of pulling me right into the story and keeping me there.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Great movie, the character's are fantastic as are the actors who portray them!  I'm actually thinking of buying this as a permanent addition to my collection, I liked it that much!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Definitely worth the buy. It's addicting and basically almost like SIM City. Not a bad game to download. I like how it keeps going even when you aren't playing it.
B00821OX98|5.0|Found by accident while checking out Prime streaming videos. Glad I gave it a chance!!! Great hit and take on the alien invasion genre. I would recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi. It is a interesting take on the invasion theory.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is great having the forecast at my fingertips all the  time. I check it when it is convenient rather than listen to the radio.
1616550414|5.0|My wife loves the Zelda franchise. I grew up playing and really really like everything about it but she takes it to another level. So picking out a unique Zelda gift for her can be hard but this book is the Encyclopedia Britannica of Zelda. Needless to stay it was more than well recieved. ;)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A definite page turner. I couldn't put it down. Read it in two days and didn't want it to end. Jodi Picoult is my &#34;new&#34; favorite author.  Can't wait to read more of her books. Have already recommended it to a friend
B003EVFHYG|5.0|I really like this soundtrack.  The movie, of course, is even better, but the music is outstanding.  I play the soundtrack when my students are practicing Sustained Silent Reading.  They like this track almost as well as Batman Begins--and that is saying something.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Decent movie, Good twist on the Disney tale, by far the hottest evil queen from any movie ever produced...lol great
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Once again, another great season of this story.  My husband and I just love this series. We are happy to add this to our collection.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Usual fanesty laden romance. Sexual encounters a bit over done. As always boy gets girl in the end and we will live happily ever after.  A mindless quick read
B004S3MB2U|5.0|It is always nice to have calculator handy.  This works well, although I have not used it much yet.  Good to have though.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|Great download. Worth the 2.99 on sale.  Downloaded and transferred to my iphone flawlessly.  Great transaction. Will download more music from Amazon.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|I have found this to be useful. I have only used it a couple of times though and do not know it limitations yet.
0062238868|4.0|The most lethal SEAL sniper on the battlefield who performed near miracles in combat was a generous sole who gave away his $1.5 million earnings from his best seller autobiography.  Chris Kyle was gunned down by a fellow veteran on February 2nd, 2013, at a shooting range.  Mr. Kyle dodged bullets, was shot 3 times, survived 6 IED attacks, 2 helicopter crashes, and countless surgeries (source dmagazine), and in an ironic twist of fate lost his life in his home state helping a former marine with PTSD.<br /><br />American Sniper is a surprisingly candid autobiography that makes for an informative and entertaining read thanks to Mr. Kyle's candor.  He even included some of his wife's letters that, along with his own account of his military career, portrayed him as a somewhat warmongering adrenaline junkie who would put country and his fellow SEALs ahead of his family.  Among his military brethren he was a guardian angel.  It is unfortunate that his life came to an abrupt end as he had much to offer those wretched souls in need.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|It is nice to Sudoku puzzle at hand for when you are just sitting idle.  It works well, although I have not had much time recently to sit idle.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This series is about children and yet it is also quite entertaining for people<br />who like traditional adult sci-fi.<br /><br /> Adults do all the heavy lifting but the children are the gems, being fought over<br />in a struggle between an alien race that wants to capture them and their parent<br />who want to protect them.<br /><br />Great series!!
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this app! It makes using a dictionary great fun. It's packed with great tidbits, such as quote for the day, pieces of historical information, and great game of &quot;Hangman&quot;. Absolutely love it and use it all the time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What a great series.  It is a must watch but you really should start at the beginning with the first episode of season 1.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb's best book yet takes on the concept on fragility in the modern world and how we fail to build anti-fragile systems. Brilliant book.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I &lt;3 THIS APP! I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE ARE BAD REVIEWS! I HOPE THAT THEY MAKE<br />MORE! IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING GOOD TO SAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO<br />MEAN!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I'm not the greatest game player. This moves very fast and needs agility in your hands and all  your fingers, too.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Nice game. You definitely get your money's worth.  Many hours of play.  Nice graphics and music. Challenging levels. graphics and music
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Since I don't have YFi at home, I needed something to be able to download from the net to my knnidle.
B007V4530A|4.0|I found that using some of the tips in Jeremey's book greatly improved my recent presentation at Texas A&M on the future of water treatment technology.  The only thing I disagree with is not opening your talk with a thank you.  Thanking the host organization and the person who invited you to speak is the polite thing to do and will have at least one person on your side from the very start.  And of course a thank you to the audience at the end.<br /><br />For anyone wishing to view the ten most popular TED Talks you can view them on the map I published:<br />[...]
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I've converted a few people who haven't seen the last two seasons. They watched the older seasons in a marathon and now we talk about the new episodes @ work. The Facebook icon is dumb and wrong.  It's a pic from \\"Arthur\\" a King Arthur Movie.....silly people.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo Blitz! Best bingo game out there! I've tried most of the ones available and hands down this beats them all!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got this game and loved it but after awhile it wouldn't work. once you clicked on the game it would go back to the home page. I haven't been able to play since December!! :(
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|Once you get about half way you have to buy the full version which is $4.99 but the game is super fun until I had to pay.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|just bought to fill in old collection of albums - Vinyl to CD to MP3...... hope this is the last time I need to re-buy.
B004478AS4|5.0|Excellent work by an excellent writer. The best work by a Nigerian writer that I have ever read. Will definitely be reading agian.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|Set up was very simple for both Android and iOS apps.<br />iOS better but still not perfect. Keeps refreshing. Have only tested with within home network.<br />Android support is weak. Tested out of home network and was disappointed.<br />Even within home network, static image and time lag.<br />Overall this could be a much better product.<br />Price not justified but not many options available for wifi monitoring. Surprising in today's commercial times.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|The cloud runs greatly with the Kindle FIRE. I was given it as a hand-me-down gift, quite generous but still not so easy to figure out all of the things you can do with it.  I hear there are booklets online which is good since my vision is getting worse by the day,I have learned to download books and &#34;stuff&#34; from Amazon, send emails, and am almost good at remembering to check how much battery I have left before I run out and realize I have misplaced my fancy charger (which also takes the cord that comes with it 'I guess' - it was with what I got, but I bought the fancy charger thing and some other charger thing that I haven't seen for like weeks.<br /><br />I am singing praises of the Cloud and all of the magic it allows to appear onto my Kindle. I have no clue what I would do without it now that I have it. Everyone needs Cloud if they have anything that needs it - which they must need it for about everything.. It is small enough to fit in places the big things won't, they have bags (though cute but silly)  have found a pleather binder that it fits in with the charger cord, and a place to put the stylus pens, since I am nervous and tend tot double letters that should only need to go in once... Call me klutz.<br /><br />Word of advice, if you don't have a friend who got himself the bigger Kindle and had one he wanted to gift, whom he felt was worthy; I was miss fortunate and got it... yay me... you need to wish to be (out loud of course or they won't think of you more than likely) his intent was to give it to a homeless / street person of which he knows several. Remind him how much you need it - going on an extended trip with no computer, no way to send messages (yeh, the phone,,, but only so many characters...as you can tell, I am wordy).  Get one, whether or not you have to buy it or get it like I did.  You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />The only negative thing I not being able to get the characters bigger to be able to see them. I got my magnifying think out - but can't find it right now - so that should help where the offerings don't help me. I love the way you can go sideways from the other way - long - that is the bomb. 'Nuf said.  Get one.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Make sure after you watch this magnificent movie you watch the producers/directors remarks.  What an education. This is a watch over and over and over again movie.

B0086449YA|5.0|Great bunch of new songs from Mark. Thoughtful lyrics and brilliant guitar. A Mark Knopfler or Dire Straits fan should own it.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I was connected to Facebook and I had to delete it because it told me to re install it so I did and my progress was deleted
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am surprised that I finished this book! The start was so boring and odd. The middle was gripping and the end was unsolved.

B0011UJMK2|5.0|A must read! An incredible look at the paranoia of life in mid fifties communist Russia coupled with a riveting story based on a real murder spree and the individuals who risked everything in their attempt to track down the killer.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I was looking around for an interesting series and this book grabbed me from page one through the end.  I can't wait to read more.  If you are looking for a good read, dive right in.  I just wish it were longer.

B00A6QPT36|5.0|This is the 2010 _Region_Free_ U.K. 2-disc Blu-ray release. It's the same as the U.S. 2-disc digi-book without the book, just the two discs in a standard Blu-ray two disc case. Case cover and disc have European markings. The blue and read seals with numbers (18; minimum purchase and viewing age) are the Irish (Rep. of) and U.K. These are their government equivalents of the U.S. film industry's MPAA ratings; film is rated \\"R\\" by MPAA which equates to the Irish and U.K. ratings. The discs have these two seals plus a third, German one (minimum age in Germany: 16). Unlike European DVDs which usually cannot play properly in U.S. DVD players (PAL vs. NTSC encoding; an issue completely unrelated to region protection code \\"flags\\"), region free Blu-ray discs should play without any problem in U.S. Blu-ray players. Indeed they should play in *any* Blu-Ray player in *any* region (that's had its firmware updated/maintained properly).<br /><br />The 2000 \\"Extended\\" version is on Disc 1 with some of the extras; 1973 \\"Theatrical\\" version is on Disc 2 with more extras. Both discs are 50 GB dual-layer. The 2010 transfer of both versions is excellent without jitter and containing superb detail with equally excellent restoration to eliminate any significant print damage. Color rendition looks good (to me). I did not see any DNR issues. It's not 100% perfect, but quite likely about as good as can be done transferring and re-mastering 37 year old print(s). Some difference in film stocks and shooting units (cameras ??) can be seen in the beginning that was shot in Iraq if one looks carefully at these scenes. In addition, film grain can be seen in places. This isn't the transfer, it's the original film stock used, and the cinematography units and their cameras. In short, on a 1080p HDTV, it's about as good as you'd get as an optical projection of a film print in a theater. Original audio was monaural (surprised me some for a 1973 film). It's been remixed to DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 ES on the \\"Extended\\" and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround on the \\"Theatrical.\\" Sounds very good with things still well centered on the \\"center\\" channel; remixing was not over-done. Fidelity is quite good considering its source is a 1973 era analog monaural recording (the kind of fidelity and bass thumping found in current films isn't there and never was). Mid-level and higher home 5.1 systems will deliver better audio with finer details to be heard than anyone ever experienced in any theater in 1973. Purists might complain that the transfer was reformatted to 1.78:1 (16:9 HDTV ratio) compared to the 1.85:1 aspect ratio as it was originally projected theatrically using a projection mask on the theater projector's film gate. This was NOT done by cropping anything from what was originally projected in theaters, it was performed by opening up the frame slightly top and bottom during the transfer. The full-frame original negative and work prints are 1.37:1 aspect ratio (~4:3). Cinematography was composed in-camera for 1.85:1 projection during shooting using viewfinder masks. (This was and continues to be an industry standard alternative to shooting and projecting for wide screen using anamorphic lenses.)<br /><br />What's to say about the film itself? It's a well-known classic - even those (adults) who have never seen it generally understand its content. Completely deserving of its R rating by the MPAA due to extremely strong language, a very disturbing scene with sexual content involving the girl (while possessed), and graphically violent death scenes. It is only one or two steps shy of NC-17 although the MPAA has gradually become much more tolerant with film content over the years. Like most thrillers, suspense and horror genre of its era, its pacing is slower than many current films in these same genre that launch immediately into non-stop action. Instead, it lays the character and story groundwork while gradually building the frequency and intensity of disturbing and horrific incidents until the climax at the very end. As I understand it, the \\"Extended\\" version is the 2000 Director's Cut which restored nearly all (if not all) the scenes that were cut by Friedkin after the studio execs reviewed the film. Blatty, the novel and screenplay author, was extremely upset with Friedkin for many years over this, in spite of the film's immense success and continued popularity. The \\"Extended\\" represents what would have been originally released had a studio exec not suggested these cuts, or if Friedkin had ignored that exec's suggestions. It's become a horror classic that has withstood nearly four decades of other horror film writers and directors chasing after its macabre presentation of pure evil . . . and this done in an era without any CGI and other modern special effects. It doesn't need the modern audio-visual shock methods as its terror preys upon the mind as much or more as it does the visual and aural senses. Few since are its peer. The ten Academy nominations including Best Picture, and seven Golden Globe nominations it received . . . unheard of for a horror film including being the first one nominated for an Academy Best Picture . . . should be telling. In my opinion it's a \\"must see\\" . . . either version . . . for those that like or study the horror and thriller film genre (although I recommend the Extended).<br /><br />Note that even now, the writer and director do NOT consider this a \\"horror\\" film and never have.

B00A85EMVK|2.0|i already have the dvd version and was dissapointed with the poor sharpness of the 3d version. sometimes the color is way off. too bad !
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I love this game it's so relaxing and it still sharpens your mind so you learn to figure out ways to make something work in a way that you could have ever imagined.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I like the actor and like airplanes, so here goes my only grudge:  since the elevators of the aircraft were blocked in the down position the pilot could never have landed going out of the inverted position
0061120081|5.0|This is the second time I am reading it. It is a book which I would recommend every 13 year old - adult to read. I would recommend it as a read-aloud, so that you can discuss it afterwards. It has mature thematics but in our century I have heard worse and much more descriptive.To Kill A Mockingbird addresses honesty, integrity, racism, loyalty, gossip and much more. The vocabulary is superb, and I used the dictionary for some of the words.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|this film in my opinion is the best movie about submarine warfare ..the image is superb and so is the sound,the explosions make you fear for your loudspeakers..... a must !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book rocks!!  I loved this book (also hated some parts).  This has to be the best book ever written!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Very entertaining movie with solid performances by everyone and bluegrass music from some legendary performers is an added bonus for me. Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book.  After reading 'Catching Fire' you must read 'Mockingjay'.  This is one of the best books I have read!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and just like the mahjong I remember playing.  I really like it and will continue to play it.
B001DM1VXE|4.0|a little confusing at first but seem to pull one into the story and try to consider the possibility of what if.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the graphics and the layout. The App is very user friendly. I highly recommend it. If you need a Bible app this is the one.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I like the message behind this movie and the humor.  My toddler loves the bears, marshmallows, and bright colors.  All-around great movie for the whole family!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you're a horse fan this is the right game. This is a awesome game. Your family will love it.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I rarely review purchaes, that being said I love this music.  While I think David is still finding his confidence musically I feel emotion from him and the songs, that I don't feel from a most artists. I hope he continues to write and perform his music.  He really is a powerhouse who just doesn't know it yet.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I was expecting to see the entire book in one movie.  Had I known there were 3 movies, 2 of which are not out yet, I would have waited to order all three at once.  I loved the special effects, though and hope the next 2 movies come out quickly.  It's hard to remember it all after a year or more has passed, especially in the first original book.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This would make an excellent ongoing show or movie trilogy.<br /><br />Amazon has got the quality stream on lock down.<br /><br />Amazon once again satisfying our household viewing needs.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|It was a good movie but the first one was the best of the series.  I can only say this tied the trilogy together and that's a big plus.  Recommended for folks who want a set of the three movies.  It was worth 4 stars.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I love this movie. I love Cinderella and I thought this was a cute take on the ever popular story.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This was the way to end 10 years of reading books, watching movies and traveling along with a magic bunch of people who lightened my heart and in the end, good and evil had a great clash.  A lot of programs will follow and copy J.K. Rowlings' work.  Never catch up, will they? I recommend this to everybody who loved Harry from the time he was a youngster and at the end when he was truly all grown up...  All the characters were great... scary fun, but fun nonetheless... and magic is the most fun of all for humans to pretend they can do, right?
B000209ZAE|5.0|Awesome, this is a great value. Pretty good quality too. Decently well made for the price.  Works well with my high end proxxon unit.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Excellent pictures and videos in Myrtle Beach of my son and I getting our scuba certificating. Can't wait to use it in Destin, Florida, the Bahamas and Mexico
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|Sensitively written account of atrocities and life in Nth Korea.  Hard to believe that it is real life in our generation.  Sad for the main character but always hopeful that he will find peace.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the Piano guys. I enjoy using it at nap time at work. I work in a day care. It keeps me awake and into the music! It is even nice to listen to when you just need a good selection to listen to.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|couldn't get into it or read far into it - too much lost in translation and English translation difficult read
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This was a really good first season, with splendid character development, satisfactory suspence, adequate acting, and a clever cliff-hanging close. BUT, why did the writers/producers think it was necessary to include the sex sequences in the first three episodes, and why did they choose to bring street language into the living rooms of America, setting another bad example for youngster's vocabularies?
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's always nice to have the weather at your finger tips to check your local weather<br />no matter where you are.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|When I was a teenager, I LOVED this movie.  And years later, it still holds up pretty well.<br /><br />It does an excellent job of capturing teenage angst, feeling of powerlessness, and trying to fit in.  All that with a very palpable 1980's style to it.<br /><br />The world and US culture has changed since this movie was made, but it's still superbly entertaining and hits some core teenage issues that have never & will never change.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the most amazing and clever books I have ever read. I clenched my jaw the whole way through, while being totally blown away by the accuracy  of the details. Probably the most entertaiment I've ever had for thr money. I've already gifted it to several friends.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Out of all the classic John Hughes teen movies, I think this is at the top of the heap.<br /><br />It captures all the elements.  You have Ferris, the ultra cool kid who knows how to perfectly play his school, his friends, and his parents to his advantage.  And then you have Cameron, the self-conscience everyman struggling through his teenage years.  In a single day, along with Ferris' girlfriend, they live out the ultimate high school hookie fantasy.<br /><br />The movie is hilarious, uplifting, and touching at the same time.  It's one of, if not THE, best teen movies of all time.
1609611543|5.0|For anyone wanting more information on wheat intolerances and major gluten intolerances, this is another &#34;medical encyclopedia&#34; that I will reference over and over again.  I thoroughly recommend people read this book - wish I had come across it years ago.  I am wheat sensitive and so much information given in the book made sense.  No doctor will sit down and explain all these issues with you - I guess they don't have that sort of time.  It's up to the individual to get education about their health these days.  Informative reading.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|This was for my grand daughter, the third generation to love it. I hope her children get a chance to love it too.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is way more challenging than HOTEL DASH and the regular DINER DASH but I love it! The challenges are fun to complete and they REALLY challenge you!! WARNING: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!
B004X8W4A4|5.0|This book was fun to read. It is just like the tv show, Just with different names. I like Rick Castle better than Jamison Rook, but a fun read nonetheless.
B0095P31L6|4.0|this was an great movie. my kids love it and it a cartoon that has ago of mix of humor. Johnny depp is amazing
B00005JMCN|5.0|this movie was long as hell but I really got into it thank you so very much I liked the small horse
0394800192|5.0|My son is on the autism spectrum and has problems with spatial words, he likes this book and it is helping.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|So glad I finally decided to get my head around this movie. I MADE myself sit down and watch it after avoiding it awhile...and I was rewarded with great performances by D D-L and so may other solid actors. The story really is fascinating. Now I know...finally.
B002V091K2|5.0|I really liked this book. it truly was a great read. this book forces you to think of all aspects of an horrific attack-the causes and affects on all involved. i'd recommend this book to others.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Read the title, enough said. Thanks Mr. Jordan for The Wheel of Time, and thanks Mr. Sanderson for completing the series.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Good concept. not her best book by any means, however i still enjoyed it. As always, Jodi Picoult has an incredible talent for describing difficult life situations.
B00BXRFCFM|5.0|Very impressed with the album, first time listening to bring me the horizon. I will be buying the rest of their albums if they all sound like this one.
6304696558|5.0|This movie is very funny I watched it many years ago and loved it. I seen it and just had to purchase it and it arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love to text on kik and I also love to send pictures to my family. It also takes great pictures
B00006DEFA|5.0|It's been awhile since Amadeus came out.  I checked a copy<br />out of the local library to find that it was incomplete, so I<br />ordered my own copy to enjoy over and over again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found it to be very depressing but i still love it. I would have chosen Gale. He was more like her
B00006LI4D|5.0|This is an old favorite of mine.  When the disc I've owned for several years went bad, I ordered a new one.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I love that you can set every thing up the way you want to.I love that you can dim the light &amp;check the weather conditions.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is the 1st hidden object story I've played and I hope they're all as good as this was.  This was MORE than just finding hidden objects, because there are mini games at the end of each chapter. It had a interesting plot to read also. I was happy to find out I could turn my Wi-Fi off and did not have to share what I did ON FACEBOOK! Whenever it asked if I wanted to share on Fb, I just closed the box with a small X in the corner when it popped up on my screen.<br />There were multiple things to do in each chapter of the story, meaning many levels to play. You do go back to the same places in the town,but things were hidden differently or you had to find differences in the room in split screen view.<br />There are many reasons to like the game:<br />~long game play ~ran smoothly on Kindle Fire HD ~option to use hints~timed or not mode ~nice graphic/pictures~interesting plot~mini games~you can create separate player names and switch  ~able to Save game~able to skip written dialogue~~ THERE'S MORE BUT I HOPE THIS HELPS!  Simply a great game!
1616551151|5.0|When they say that this is one of the most fully realized fantasy universes they really mean it...this is one of the most detailed video game guide/art books I've ever had the pleasure to read. If you have a question about the Dragon Age world there is a very good chance that this book will answer it.<br /><br />The book includes a detailed timeline that runs along the bottom of each page. It covers both known and unknown major events, and it includes a symbol for what the event pertains to (i.e. Chantry, the Crows, etc.). This is split into seven complete sections; Nations, Races, Religion, Magic, The Fade, The Blight, Bestiary. Each section is extremely detailed and includes some amazing never before seen artwork. If you were ever curious about the individual nations like Orlais, what they like to wear, or what the dwarves religion (The Stone) is like then the book is definitely going to have the answer. I'd actually be surprised if it didn't have some form of answer to be frank. I think I actually found out more than I ever wanted to know about Dragon Age. The amount histories for each nation, each Blight, and each religion/race is just astounding. Also if you were wondering how much it incorporates the games, it does mention them or specific people from them...however if you are looking for a ton of information on the stuff specific to the games then I'm afraid this isn't for you. You're better off checking out the normal guides for that.<br /><br />I adore the artwork as well. As I said before it includes some never before seen pieces that are print-worthy in my opinion. There are some great scenery shots that look fantastic and I'd love to have in frames my walls. They also include drawings of each beast mentioned and even some familiar faces.<br /><br />This is one of those books that is perfect for your shelf if your a gamer, it's detailed and worth flipping through time and time again.<br /><br />I received this in exchange for an honest review.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|The download of the game was free, each turn can cost you real money though, and it only lasts a minute. Don't let your kids get tricked in to buying in app turns, they are ridiculously expensive. You can turn off in app purchasing on your Kindle and I strongly suggest parents keep an eye on their kids if they play such free games.<br /><br /> The play of the game itself was reminiscent of those other jewel matching games you can play for free online and is just as addictive, though with It costing money per turn and each turn being pricey it is not worth it to me. If you wait long enough more turns will generate, so if you have a quick minute to waste in a jewel matching game then go for it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Enjoy the quality. Great entertainment, I now see why it has won so many awards. Very well crafted stories, thanks!
0425252868|4.0|Being ex RAF fighter pilot myself, I found story of the Luftwaffe's most highly decorated fighter pilots' opposition to Goering fascinating.<br /><br />It was the stupidity of Hitler and his underlings of the Nazi party that eventually led to Germany lose the war (including, of course, 20 million Russians)
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Really---Did they have to use the &#34;F&#34; word that much! Even the 13 year old screaming that at her parents---
B005HEK3JW|5.0|A very few of the episodes with dark scenes could use a little work on the encode as they get a bit murky, but overall presented well.  Season 5 also has some of the best episodes of the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It is a must on your tablet and the game is basically a colourful and high energy game that gets you going.
B009NUV0E8|2.0|Not a Brosnan-as-Bond fan to begin with, so factor that in, but this is probably the worst Bond movie of the entire series IMO.
0142403873|5.0|My pre-k class attended a a play based on this book.  It was a great help to acquaint the students before the play and review after the play.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|dragonvale is a fun and livley game for all ages! with this game you can breed new dragons, and and get to have the exotic ones as well! every dragon can be breed, with the right combination and enough patience. TRY BREEDING THE PLATINUM DRAGON!
1476719071|4.0|This is the first of her books I have read and it was a great ride. Not your typical love story and that's why  it was so good!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Love the characters! Transports you back in time. Keeps me coming back for more. Well written drama with beautiful cinematography.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great basic calculator. I needed a basic calculator for my kindle fire, since it does not come standard with the kindle. Easy to use. Clear buttons.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is the funiest game I ever played it is sooooo sweet for little kids to play too I really love it.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Good movie, great acting, strong plot. I definitely love it and would recommend it to everyone. Wahlberg at his best..
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|If you liked the movie you'll like the soundtrack. There are a few songs not on the soundtrack that were in the movie as always. The Deluxe version has a few more songs from the finals that made it a must buy.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I was saddened when I learned that Google Reader was going to be turned off and immediately started looking for a replacement for all of my RSS feeds.  I read several articles about different readers and after trying a couple decided to go with Feedly.  As for the app itself it works great!  I use it to read blogs/news articles on my phone and the functionality is fairly straightforward and organizes all of my content for me.  It's a little flashier than Google Reader was, and I think that is for the good!
0307352153|5.0|Very informative and well-researched book.  I was encouraged and will recommend it to others who might benefit from this knowledge.
1616550414|5.0|Are you kidding me? Of COURSE I had to own this. I love love love the LoZ series.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Legend of Zelda!<br />- The book is actually perfect for coffee table display. Vibrant cover, well made, and oh so old school awesome.<br />- The contents (y'know, the important bits) are actually really wonderful. Amazing artwork coupled with preliminary concept drawings and series/character/game history makes this book a real winner.<br />- GREAT price! I would have expected to pay almost double what I got it for.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Um... it's big, therefore, hard to read on the toilet... yeah that's all I could come up with<br /><br />Shigeru Miyamoto created some of the biggest games of my childhood, and it's a real treat to see something like this get put together. I highly recommend this book to those interested in the LoZ franchise history.
1599218011|4.0|Very well researched and informative book for people wanting something different and tested by the author.  I would recommend it to others.
0765325950|3.0|When I was reading the book, it often felt - logically enough - like a story being told second hand,<br />by a narrator who didn't get a full grasp on the details when he heard the origin.<br />But there are also some truly great moments which remind me of amazing chapters in previous books, such as \\"With the Choedan Kal\\".<br /><br />I've been reading WoT for fifteen years now, and while I'm somewhat disappointed in this far from perfect final volume :<br />\\"It was not the end, for there could not be a proper ending to the story of the Wheel of Time.<br />But it was AN end.\\"
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|This movie has what it takes to entertain me.  A decent story line, a simple plot, and plenty of action.  There was no real edge of my seat experience, but that is okay.  I enjoyed the movie enough that I may purchase it.  I am afraid that the studio has set the audience up for potential disappointment.  The movie makes it very clear that there is more story to tell and ends with an undeniable sequel set up, but I find it difficult to believe that the following books will be made into movies.  To me this is 'Push' all over.<br />There are some violent and potentially disturbing scenes for young viewers.  A lack of swearing makes it safe for young adults.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This story left me at a sad end that will make any reader feel sad for when the two boys die together in the end as best friends forever
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|takes a long time to load but other than that pretty good and way way very better than1 peace out homies
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Fat from the best I've read, but father than the worst. I'm also struggling with the have another baby conundrum and the last chapter struck me the most. Cheers to Tina, thanks for the read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games series is good by  the last book of this fantastic trilogy made me sad, glad, an  fearful. This book ha  the best ending I have  ever read and each chapter is suspensful and enjoyable. I would recommend  this to all adults an  children who are skilled at reading. Some parts I did not understand and I'm 11 years old and in advanced language arts. To sum this book up I think this is a great novel and probably on  of the best books out there!
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Loved it.  A very good story that is better than the one it is the sequel of (Caves of Steel).
B0049IHX2C|4.0|So,the bit part,she has not seen the other two movies,and she asked me to buy them so she can see them all,So if that isn't liking this movie then (what is)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun.I love how the game's setting changes a lot!I am not joking about this.Please get it.get survival craft too.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|It will change one's life forever.  Just knowing two of the principles will allow the joy and happiness to grow.  Worrying about people's opinion of you, or what you do, or wear, or look like, comes to an end.<br /><br />These four agreements are simple and easy to understand.  I am happy I bought  this book and reread it often.  It gives me positive perspectives  on my life.
B0034G4P80|5.0|THOR comes to life in the person of actor Chris Hemsworth, in this excellent Marvel Comics movie which explains and illustrates all the interesting elements in Stan Lee's comic universe as it relates to THOR, and the ancient Viking religion and legends.<br />This movie also dovetails nicely with the other movie entries in the Marvel Comics franchise, such as CAPTAIN AMERICA, IRON MAN and THE AVENGERS, which also showcases THOR quite nicely, and his arch-rival Loki. Highly recommended!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|it's wonderful at any age.  It's interesting and fun to read.  And for a brief time, I am there with them living their lives.  I.  highly recommend it to anyone especially for those that love historical fiction...it's the best.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce Willis fans are not disappointed in this terrific first-class spy thriller about rogue elements within the government which cause RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) CIA agents to come out of retirement to finish the job started by the corrupt ones.<br />A wonderful all-star cast sparkles like diamonds in this excellent and fun action thriller! Highly recommended! I give this movie 10 stars out of 10 on the Imdb.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I never thought I would see another movie or series that I would like regarding Sherlock Holmes.  When I first caught an episode of Elementary, I got hooked and between each episodes storyline and the characters evolving, I can't wait for each new episode to be released.  Having made Dr Watson a woman in this program was a unique but very welcomed change.  Unlike Nigel Bruce who kind of played a more bumbling character, Lucy Loo is quickly rising to Holmes' level.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love this series.  Wish all the series were completed!  Books and HBO series!  Very entertaining.  I love the series very much!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Good storyline which keeps evolving.  It will be interesting to see where the storyline will go now that his identity is known to others.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|This would have been better if they used true singers instead of actors.  The story itself is a good one.  Depressing though...
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|I can't wait for new episodes to come out.  Just when you think you know what is going to happen a spin takes place which throws you way off the mark.  This whole program I would class along with &#34;Law & Order&#34;; however, the difference is in the twists it hits you with.  Even though it seems like the villains is crumbling I can't wait to see how they pull this one off.  Amazing amazing acting and script writing!
B000I8G5B2|3.0|I was unfamilar with this movie, my colleague said we use after our Genetics Unit as a finishing activity.  I found it difficult to show in class because it took so much time to get back to the beginning and reload.  I lost instructional time and students were very confused, even though I gave them background information.  I do not think it had the impact needed to end an important unit like Genetics!
B0058VW36U|2.0|I  am not too excited about this game.  It  doesn't  hold  my  interest  or  entertain  me.  I  probably  will  delete  the app.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Such a special story which surely appeals to all ages.  There are overtones of Forrest Gump in its conception but it would present a much more challenging subject for a film.  The story rolls along at a steady pace and at times it is difficult to put the book down.  Of course it has its place in the realms of fantasy as is true of many rollicking tales. There's an unexpected twist  in almost every chapter and some ingenious methods of keeping the reader wondering what will happen next. Would recommend it to everyone, young and old, for those who remember the 20th century and as an education for those who were born later.
B0087GF8ZG|1.0|this thing was working as advertised, and then one weekend, about a little over a month from purchase date, it just started to constantly turn on at the \\"auto\\" setting, quickly draining the battery in a few day's time.<br /><br />switching between the different modes, or resetting the device by taking the batteries out did not help.  off to buy another better light.<br /><br />also it's good for sensing motion straight ahead, very bad when sensing motion from below.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this game is awesome I play it everyday it is so addicting wanse u star it u wont want to stop it
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a post-apocalyptic thriller set in an underground silo. the author describes a bleak world, with class divisions and An ultimate punishment of being a cleaner sent out into a hostile world. Hugh Howey, when is the next edition coming out? I want to know the back story and what happens to Juliette and the survivors.
B009GXHOW4|1.0|I Hate this app I turned a world to creative and, it won't turn back!!  never get it!!!!!!!!!  &gt;:( IT SUCKS
B009TKKBNI|3.0|...less effective somehow? Well I was expecting something *more* about this EVA (yep, the name is also symbolic LOL!) even if I knew it to be the 1st film from this director: it's been successful at festivals & it's also unusual to have a film like that made in Spain, since it probably looks more \\"British\\" (plus it features Daniel Bruhl, always a guarantee), but hey anyway it's been a nice movie to have around for a change.<br />It's more a sort of psychological thriller-melodrama than a real sci-fi movie in my opinion: despite the beautiful Swiss landscape, good cast & the ambitious idea beneath it, regarding what robots might become around 2040, I think it lacks pace & in a certain way \\"answers\\" as well to the questions it rises. (Besides the director's vintage choice of creating a clone of the '70/80ies for the WHOLE visual look, from glasses to cigarettes, with Bowie's music! it quite bothered me because seemed really filmed in the past instead of in a futuristic era, not even in Prometheus or new Star Wars movies they did it like that, even if they had more \\"issues\\" trying to link the look of the older films to the new ones of their franchises).<br /><br />The special effects are good, they seem realistic, but again, it's a film that focuses more on the (soapy) drama of the relationships (but without grounding it to a solid background, which is all off-screen) rather than pure sci-fi: personally i.e. I didn't care as much as the director for the difficult set into the snow as a symbol for \\"something else\\", he should have developed instead the theme more clearly at least for me to truly feel it. Eva's little actress Claudia, for 1st time on screen is perfect, she's got such a natural charm \\"la nina\\", the film would have been lost without her for sure.<br />But if you also add that the basic idea isn't so original after all, & that I did see coming the \\"surprise\\" early on (Americans did the \\"children-robot's tale\\" in previous films as A.I., & somehow also Frankenstein told at the core a similar plot), then I'd have wanted something deeper, especially a longer film to explain what happens after the inevitable climax. Rethinking to Scott's similar approach, Blade Runner did have regardless that *poetic spark* missed here.<br /><br />PS_The dvd is a special edition with 2 discs, 1 has the film in Catalan or Spanish (Castellano) with English subtitles only, plus the director's commentary (only Spanish without any subtitles), the other disc contains the usual backstage things but also the deleted scenes (without subs) of the flashbacks that would have helped to flesh it out more the plot (the 1 about the past of the 3 protagonists is 22 min. long), & last but not least, the alternative finale, that would have changed the whole impact of it (for the record, I still prefer the official 1).
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Absolutely stunning music.  Real music lovers will conclude the same.  This is one of my top 3 live DVD/CD favorites.  Since buying it I have listened to it daily.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Considering this book is over 1200 pages long, I was surprised that I never felt like the story dragged or asked myself if it was ever going to end. Sanderson takes takes a handful of main characters and develops them slowly, but deliberately so that when there are tragedies, triumphs, and shifts in their thinking you really find yourself caring or cringing at their actions. Despite the books length, it's obvious the overall story arc is intended to unfold over several books, this this acting as one extremely long prologue to what will likely be more than just a trilogy. Although the true scope of the story doesn't become terribly clear until the end of 1280 pages, it still doesn't feel like Sanderson is trying to pad his page count and turn a novel into a series. Every event feels like a crucial step to the next, and to the ultimate setup for caring about the struggles to come. It's not a quick read, but it is an easy and highly recommended read.

B00B2V66VS|1.0|the title is exactly what it is... &quot;boring !!!&quot;  sure its intertaining when you first get it, but after about 10 minutes you will pritty much forget about it. that's right, I deleted it in less that 20. the only thin this game is even remotely useful for is getting annoying little kids to leave you alone for about 10 minutes before they get bord.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I'm a serious Tolkien fan...read the trilogy 13 times (less so the Hobbit), heard it on audio books even more.  Peter Jackison's adaptation of the Ring is one of the greatest achievements in cinema.  The Hobbit?  One can quibble with lots of things - he's gone beyond the book itself to consult the various appendices from the whole body of Tolkien's work.  Will it be worth three movies?  I'm under his spell, and thoroughly enjoyed this first installment.  He has the perfect Bilbo in Martin Freeman, and the Darves are equally fine.  The 3D is sometimes too obvious, like the effects were worked in after the fact, but that might also be my inability to adjust all the aspects on my set.  I was totally pleased.

0307279189|5.0|So... inspirational and resourceful.  Wish had read it 10 years earlier...  Chronic pains forced me to get up running.  It seemed that enduring the mental torture wasn't hard enough, pains began to show up in knees, shins, ankles... first during running, then all day long.  Doc visits, x-rays, MRI's, expensive running shoes, no help.  A few months after reading this book, pains have substantially subsided from changing the way I run and running has changed from torture to something highly enjoyable... A book any new runner should read.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love Blake Shelton and this cd is amazing! I love all of his new songs on here and so does my husband.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Great album from start to finish. Just as much a masterpiece as their first album. Don't listen to the people who say they are only a \\"gimmick\\" band. I listened to the first album for quite a while before I saw any pictures of them, the way they dress only adds to the atmosphere of their live show. But anyway, if you liked the first album I don't see why you wouldn't like this one.

0061743526|5.0|i had read this book for school and loved it. I loved it so much that I decided to pick it up and read it again and again. The plot is great and so is the characters. Probably the best book I've read.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Although the interface is okay, my two main gripes with this app are that it NEVER show the maps or overlays on my Galaxy Nexus and that I have to let it sit for about 10 seconds when I start it because it's too busy trying to update everything for display. It's also notorious for setting off Watchdog as an app that takes up a significant amount of resources when it's active, no doubt because of the previous issues above.<br /><br />Although WeatherBug has its own issues to deal with, but at least it's quick, responsive, and gives me information I want by touching an icon instead of scrolling through several windows.  And at least WeatherBug's radar display WORKS.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive. Ever since I got it on my Kindle Fire it's been the first thing I see when I open my tablet. In fact Temple Run 2 has been pushed back. I would definitely reccomend this game to fans of Temple Run.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|Everything was perfect and in good shape, the cover didn not present any damage, the season is complete and runs great
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Shiny!!!!<br />Cannot believe there is only one season.  I have watched these episodes multiple times and they all hold up.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Excellent game. unable to put down. Can be challaging but with the right strategy  u dont have to pay a cent to beat it. multiplayer is a different story ...it pushes you to use IAP. still with patience a d some luck u can build a very competetive deck without spending a dime.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Drug addicts, Alcohol abuse and all sorts of problems related have been known to me vaguely as it has to most of us not directly involved. This excellent book, well written and very entertaining has been an eye opener to me. I loved it and felt almost part of the various well described people involved. I good read!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This was a required text for a class i was taking and i was dreading having to read it.  After reading the first chapter i was hooked and ended up finishing it within 24 hours.  It is an interesting point of view with a very intriguing main character.  All of his little quirks and side effects from his condition as well as the way his mind works, make this a very enjoyable story especially for people going into a career dealing with children.  Highly recommended
B007HO392S|5.0|One of my favorite cds! All of her songs are amazing and I'm so glad that I bought the cd.
B006Z7NTCI|5.0|With a really soulful and energetic feel.<br />It is new-agey, while avoiding the &#34;insipid electronica&#34; that a lot of new age music has become.
B0027Z9C2I|3.0|I enjoyed most of the songs, but felt the story would have benefitted from a little more dialogue. The ending was unexpected and cute. Altogether, a very cute movie, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|If you are a Hendrix fan, like me, you get suckered into buying every new relase of every jam version of every song.<br />This is OK, but just more of the same.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I love this album after only one complete listen. I have been a fan since day one and I agree with others that they have grown up and changed, but in amazing ways! Their music is always very inventive and I personally can identify with the lyrics. Wonderful album!!!!!
B004I2K4E8|4.0|We love Les Mis. This 25th anniversary celebration has many good parts but not quite as good overall as the 10th anniversary celebration. It is much better than the movie that we found too graphic with actors that can't sing as well as the stage performers.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie it connects to aliens in the general understanding of other areas previously vied. It was a great script and story line. I was disapointed personally at cast that were killed but that happens with me in every movie.

B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Django Unchained is an absolutely wonderful movie, a must see. I would recommend that this movie is bought so it can be watched over and over again.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|I saw the movie last night and when I got home I bought the Score (Deluxe version from iTunes with 30 tracks). This is an excellent score that sets and captures the mood for Oblivion. Great job on the score to M83 (Anthony Gonzalez) and Joseph Trapanese. Oblivion is Joseph Kosinski's second movie after Tron: Legacy. If you enjoyed the score for Tron, I believe you will enjoy this one too.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The Best James Bond yet. Daniel Craig is the Best James Bond yet. I have seen it three times and it keeps getting better.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I ready Red Shirts which turned me on to Old Man's War.  I thought this book was even better than Red Shirts.  Once it got rolling, I couldn't stop reading it. The story really flows and is structured just right to be made into a movie.  I can't wait to read the follow on books to this story line.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|In equal parts devastating and humorous, worth the read for the glimpse it provides into the reality of living with a terminal illness.
B008I15774|4.0|Carl Schuricht is far less well remembered than he should be.  A conductor of the more \\"classical\\" school of interpretation, he nonetheless leaned a bit more toward the \\"romantic\\" school than did like-minded colleagues such as George Szell, which was all to the good.  Apparently a humble man with strong institutional loyalties (both rare traits among podium maestros), he was content to remain and work with what were ranked second-tier institutions despite the recognition of his considerable interpretive gifts but his more famous colleagues, who held him in high esteem.  His conducting was marked by clarity and transparency of textures, finely gauged balance of orchestral voices, fluidity of phrasing, a sense of spontaneity and simplicity (in the positive sense of that term), and great integrity, with close fidelity to the printed score.<br /><br />This set brings together almost all of Schuricht's slender legacy for EMI -- his cycle of the Beethoven symphonies (partly monaural, partly stereo) with the Paris Conservatory Orchestra, and his three stereo Bruckner symphony recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic.  Inexplicably, it omits recordings of a couple of Mozart symphonies and a violin concerto, also with the Vienna Philharmonic.  (Some years back Decca release a five-CD set of his 1950s monaural recordings for that company, before it dropped him from its roster.)  Although the Paris ensemble was rightly regarded as second-rate even at its best, Schuricht had a longstanding and fruitful relationship with it, and managed to coax results from it here considerably beyond its norm.  These are wonderfully spirited and buoyant performances; Schuricht's approach to Beethoven is brisk, linear, and energetic. Those of the First, Second, Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh are almost playful; those of the Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth create their drama by taut rhythmic drive instead of harmonic weightiness.  If the Ninth is a more lightweight account than that to which we mostly are accustomed, it has many of the virtues of period instrument performances without any of their drawbacks, and a solo quartet that, despite the lack of leading vocalists (except for bass Gottlob Frick), performs far better than many nominally more stellar foursomes.  For evenness of quality throughout, this is one of the best Beethoven cycles ever recorded; while no single performance ranks as a first choice, they are all very good, and unlike most sets there is not a single glaring weak link anywhere in it.<br /><br />Schuricht's Bruckner has long been held in high regard; I am in a minority in being less fond of these recordings of the Eighth (uncharacteristically rushed compared to his surviving live performances) and Ninth (solid but not exciting).  Those who disagree with me will naturally rate those recordings as a prime reason to acquire this set.  On the other hand, Schuricht's Bruckner Third was my introduction to Bruckner on LP as a teenager, following a televised Leonard Bernstein discussion and performance of just the first movement.  To this day I rank it alongside Eugen Jochum's DG recording as one of the two finest of this work ever made, a wonderfully dynamic performance that strips away accumulated layers of heavy varnish to reveal a Bruckner that has muscular litheness as well as transcendental power.  (Extraordinarily, the work was not previously part of Schuricht's repertoire, and he learned it just to make this recording.)<br /><br />EMI's Icon series is a super-budget edition that offers no new remasterings, though I am told that it re-licensed the studio version of the Beethoven Ninth back from the Testament label for this set.  In any case, the price makes this an easy investment even on an experimental basis.<br /><br />The Haenssler label has released two large boxed sets of 20 and 10 CDs (with many of those items also offered separately) of broadcast performances of Schuricht with his longtime ensemble, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony.  Those contain many notable performances, including seven Beethoven symphonies (all but #2 and #8) and five Bruckner symphonies (#4, 5, 7, 8, 9).  The Beethoven symphonies are generally very similar interpretively to the ones in this set, with slightly inferior playing and recorded sound.  The Bruckner performances of the Eighth and Ninth are to me much more interesting than the ones offered here, though again the recorded sound is inferior and the Eighth suffers some several cracked notes in the brass section.  My hope is that collectors will firs try this set, and then be as pleased with it as I am to try some of the Haenssler recordings and rediscover a superior but unjustly neglected conductor.

B00BKBCF38|1.0|Give me a break...<br /><br />This band isn't even METAL!  They are just being marketed to the metal demographic because of the imagery and lyrics.<br /><br />Musically, they sound like a 70's rock band....the vocals are absolutely HORRENDOUS.. \\"Papa Emeritus\\"? More like Papa John's Pizza if you ask me.  Extra Cheese!<br /><br />There are so many REAL metal bands out there busting their asses to make a living, and it's a shame media creations like this end up getting all the fanfare.  Just the \\"flavor of the month\\".<br /><br />That all said, I am sure this will go platinum, or gold. lol

I have the Keystone recordings and I guess I like Jerry with a Hammond B3 backing him-he was quite the colorful musician and the B3 complimented his sound nicely.

0061452068|5.0|Matt Ridley looks at how humans have developed our societies and technologies since the stone age. Sharing ideas has regularly produced new improvements for both sides in the trade. This is such a consistent trend that it's irrational to assume that we're doomed. We seem head for more and better times in the future.
B0030B621W|4.0|I don't want to give away the plot, so no spoilers here.  This is an excellent story that's a cross between something by Ray Bradbury and Prometheus.  Kind of haunting and creepy, in a dark humanity sort of way.  Totally worth the watch.
B003ELY7IS|5.0|Wow! I think that I am Michael's biggest fan, and all I can say is that this book was beautiful! He was so intelligent, thoughtful, unassuming and quietly confident, that one could not help  but love him. I truly believe that he is one of God's treasured angels. I really love and miss him.<br />Although I really enjoyed reading Michael's words, the book is terribly edited. I think Michael would have been disappointed with it, seeing that he was such a perfectionist. Anyway, I totally ignored the terrible editing and focused on Michael's words. So inspirational and encouraging! Michael Jackson forever!!!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was engrossed in the story line of the first two books. And eager to devour every word of the third. However, this installment felt rushed. And the ending was well, just lame. I get that she could not end up with  Gale, but the way in which Katniss ended up stuck in the burned out shell of District Twelve pumping out children she did not want was just a shame. Again, the whole thing just felt like the author just wanted to be done with it and not take the time to think any of it through. Every thing before was brilliant.

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I love period based films and this takes you away into a wonderful era. A young Ryan O'Neal is very easy on the eyes.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|A very good app. Once I figured out &#34;I&#34; was the problem, not the app. I really like this one. And the customer service is very good also. I emailed them with my initial problem, which turned out to be user error, and someone got back to me within 2 hours. I'd recommend this app.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Beautiful music, beautiful story!  Some of the singing cold have been better, but it is still excellent. The more times I see it, the less I find to criticize.
B00AFOS6P2|3.0|The good news is that 1/2 of this album is great, songs like Wide Lovely Eyes,<br />Water's Edge, Higg's Boson Blues and Push The Sky Away are classic Cave--well<br />written moody ballads.<br />  The bad news; is this really a \\"Bad Seeds\\" album, the electronic \\"music\\" becomes  redundant where are the real \\"Bad Seeds\\"? Also, the whole center of this<br />uneven album sounds like there was a serious lack of editing of the lyrical<br />content. Jubilee Street rambles on and as my mother used to say \\"..sounds like he wrote it sitting on the toilet\\". Not everything that comes to an artist's mind is<br />genius--then Mr. Cave has the testicular fortitude to write a song about creating<br />that snoozefest of a song--Finishing Jubilee Street. Where are the scathing rockers?<br />I will admit that since his album Murder Ballads I have found Cave's music to be fairly uneven, his lyrics sometimes become laughable--overly melodramatic-- or sound, as on Grinderman albums, like a man having a mid-life crisis.<br />  David Bowie's The Next Day, Richard Thompson's Electric, Robyn Hitchcock's<br />Love From London and Otis Taylor's My World Is Gone are all great albums from start to finish, I would recommend those over this, but as I said in the beginning there are a few great songs here...just don't expect the edgy genius of the real \\"Bad Seeds\\".
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It was such a treat going down memory lane - the 80s was such a fun decade. What a great idea for a book!
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy playing temple run. I think it is a perfect in the car during a long car trip, and trust me I have been on alot of those lately! Over all, I think temple run is a great game to play from being bored to simply waiting! If you have not played it, I highly reccomend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun and amazing game. It is way better than temple run. It has crazy but fun updates and changes. I can't wait to see the next update!
1936608898|5.0|If you are willing to throw out all your food beliefs, this program really works.  As I stated in the title... you have to be willing to commit to a major change.
0688172377|5.0|Once you start reading it you can't put it down! Amazing life story! Also thanx to it I learned that such atrocities as female genital mutilation still exist in the modern world, unfortunately... Together, as a society, we should fight against it
B00AFROVQC|5.0|really enjoyed the story but finished in about one day.  all four books currently out could have easily been released as one.  still, I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series when it is released.  hopefully soon
B00A3VLJCE|1.0|The interface is completely unusable on the Note 2, no wonder Google doesn't allow it to be downloaded from the Play Store.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Excellent use if words to create each exciting scene in your mind....imagining being there..a part of the group....planning a trip to Las Vegas.....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Can't get enough of this author now! He's changed the way I view death and leaving our mark in life. Wow.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|hard to put down,  most was all on t.v. or movie but a good read. five more words needed one more.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Made for kids.  Not all those not-so-subtle double entendres for adults. But great fun.  Actual quality and innocence. And even a good message for the kiddos.  Great family movie for young and old alike.
B00BF11STU|5.0|As a retired military officer and someone who was in New York on 9/11/2001 and knew a number of people killed that day, I had a reason to be pissed off.  I was glad that we were able to finally capture/kill/and dsipose of Osama Ben Ladin.  I am just sorry that it took so long.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So many different but amazing changes that makes it so good. Better than temple run 1. The best game ever.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|A terrific app that functions perfectly. Graphics and sound are clear and not too intrusive or distracting. Of course not like the real thing but it helps you develop a sense of a tennis court and where a good shot would be. The app gives you a choice of several games and at different levels so you can enjoy the variety as your skill level increases. Very recommended!
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|Downloaded as free app of the day, really fun gets you thinking about how you should build the bridge and with what piece you should use, addicting
B0045HCJQW|5.0|What can you say about the stars in this delightful movie...Had to have the original to go along with High Society.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|Reminds me of a game that Apple has in their app store called oven break where a gingerbread man runs to get out of an oven while collecting candy and letters, pretty fun game
1452111014|5.0|As an aspiring artist, I picked this book because I was enamored with the movie and I wanted to be more familiar with the process in which Disney animators revise their characters/setting/story until the final cut. I found the book to be informative on how the designers developed places like Sugar Rush (using actual models made out of candy)and Heroes' Duty  through images. The commentary that is available on the character/background pages themselves are easy to digest and don't take long to read, although I had expected a bit more in-depth explanation/description. The core four characters are also given their due 15 minutes in the spotlight, with more than just a page of their visual evolution.<br /><br />In addition, the backgrounds featured within the book are BEAUTIFULLY rendered on the pages; they too have several pages dedicated to their development.<br /><br />Side note: This book's art does NOT cover character sheets, focusing mainly on concept art instead, as subtly implied in the book's title. It is highly suggested that you purchase the movie and screencap it for the character you'd like to work drawing on, as it provides a wide range of turn-around models, lighting differences, and structure. Alternatively, if you do not wish to purchase the movie, Google \\"Wreck-it Ralph screencaps\\"; disneyscreencaps provides a near second-by-second HD screencap collection.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|We revere Lincoln for his towering integrity and dedication to preserving the Union, not yet a hundred years old.  Goodwin is an exhaustive researcher and engaging writer, ringing back the events and concerns Lincoln dealt with with exceptional skill but also compassion.  I will retread it and other of Goodwin's studies of historical times and people.
B001HC8516|5.0|Without a doubt this book is worth a read. Not every story applied to me, but the ones that did really opened my eyes. Fantastic help to my social life, love life, and self esteem.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Not sure why this movie received such negative reviews, but it is actually a good movie if you like hero stories mixed with military firepower. It's not movie of the year material but it does keep you entertained throughout. Loved watching the USS Missouri do it up old school at the end of the movie.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|OMG I cannot wait to open it and watch it! I am sooo excited.  I will recommend this to everyone!
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|A solid drama worth watching. Director quite successful in her second military/war film.  Political critics of waterboarding or extreme methods used  to extract vital information should take notice.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I bought this for a dear friend for a birthday present,<br />Love it.  She is just so good.  What a wonderful voice!
B00846REIS|4.0|Left hanging but a decent read had fun with the humor.  Little far fetched but a good read all together.
B001S86J1C|5.0|ok so doesn't have some of the special features as the dvd but its in HD! good movie, highly recommend this edition.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|fabulous show with excellent casting.  Very engaging, you can't wait to watch the next episode.  Very glad I was able to access it here.
B000WN60MC|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory.  I thnik the show is very funny and entertaining.  The interation between the characters is hilarious.  I plan to purchase additional seasons.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great movie!! Can't wait for Despicable Me 2!! The minons are hilarious. I have watched this movies several time with my grandson.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I've been lucky enough to visit Hawaii several times and this soundtrack makes me feel that I'm back there.  I play it at work and everyone likes the soothing songs.
0767903862|4.0|I've read Bryson's other works as well. This one stands out because he captures an accurate sense of Australia from a true outsider's perspective. In addition, it's a fun read because of Bryson's very original humor.
B0086700CM|5.0|Just try it and you will be addicted! Great fast passed challenging and entertaining game with good graphics and audio.
0767903862|5.0|Recommended by tour guide in Australia and well worth the price.  Combination of travel guide and history with an emphasis on the uniqueness and oddities of the sub continent.  Could not see everything on our first trip, so the book helped fill in the blanks.  Strong endorsement of the friendly welcome when you travel &#34;Down Under&#34;.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Cinemanography was superb as were the the storyline and the plot development. The questions posed about life and spirituality were thought provoking.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this game is a fantastic portable call of duty. They should make this into an xbox game. It would be a real contender against battlefield and call of duty.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|i liked this movie even though i had some very different expectations when i rented it.  It turned out to be a very romantic and sweet piece, going more into the private lives of Hitch and his wife of so many years.  the behind the scenes of movie-making was fun and several of the actors were spot on in their portrayal of the original actors ~ ie:  the Tony Perkins actor had that vulnerable, eeriely handsome elan that i saw in the real Perkins.<br />i would recommend this film to those who want to get a glimpse of the quirks and personal picadillos that made Alfred Hitchcock such an amazing director.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Use several devices at any given time and this just keeps me in touch whenever I need to jump out of reader and answer a question.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I liked it since I like Hidden Object games.  Would like to find more of these for my Kindle please.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|I love Ian Fleming and I love Dick Van Dyke! And I add that I love Neuschwanhof and it's Mad King Ludwig owner. Funny, zany and off the wall!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much I can't wait to see what happened to district twelve I loved even more than the first book.
B0000214F0|5.0|I love Roman History, the decadence, and the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. This movie actually reflected Gibbon's book with oodles of sex, murder and mayhem. A great movie to watch Rome go to dogs. Definitely not for kids or straight laced adults.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Good and sharp right out of the box... only bad thing is that due to the coating it will not throw sparks from a ferrocerium rod ... other than that It's an awesome bushcraft knife
B00009ZYC1|5.0|I love Shrek, Mrs Shrek, the donkey and the pink dragon. They all work together to bring down the little king's despotic reign. And, oh, how the grateful villagers celebrated!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book kept me turning the pages and wondering what was going to happen next.  The narrators changed/alternated from chapter to chapter which I also enjoyed.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The 20/20 Experience is a great cd. Justin Timberlake did his thing on this cd. I say it's his best cd.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|dropped in bug out bag<br />then used it for some tools<br />and a couple of knives<br />not as good as my big kit but convient
B008DYZKQE|4.0|A wonderful story about a girl is far smarter than her princess clothes lead you to believe! My 4yo, princess obsessed daughter loved it!  Yours will to!
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I looked up very many types of bags and finally found out this one. I really like this design especially the internal design. It can be a camera bag, notebook bag, or just a book bag. the internal is enough length for books. however, it is really convenient take my camera in and out. It provided multiple travel choices.<br />I am not a person who likes carry too heavy with equipments, so this easy and light bag is exactly what I need. I will give a strong recommend with it.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Morrjani does a wonderful job writing her story. Though I bought this book because of my fascination with NDE's, I found myself caught up in her life story. Very inspiring, and beautifully written!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poor writing. Poor plot line. The &#34;sex&#34; scenes are violent. If you appreciate authors that know how to write well, spend your time with them.
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|Still is and always will be my favorite Floyd album.  In addition, it probably is the best sounding of all their albums.  Beautiful lyrics and melodies and some of Gilmours best guitar work.  Simply stunning!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I put this book off for a while after reading &#34;50 Shades&#34; due to the terrible writing. I wish I had not bothered to pick it up. I abandoned this book about a quarter of the way through after more ridiculous references to her inner goddess and subconscious. I will not read EL James again until she finds a new way to say &#34;The energy between us was palatable.&#34; Word to the wise: If you enjoy richly talented authors such as Steinbeck, Cather, or Erdich, do not bother with this series.
1432794426|5.0|Its nice to read a well written intimate positive book about Michael Jackson for a pleasant change.<br />Thank you karen Moriarty for writing an exemplary biography.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The movie is awesome....but I'm an Alien fanboy.  The Bluray worked fine and I had no problems with it.  End up making my own fan edit with the deleted scenes and the movie is much better.  I hope Sir Ridley Scott comes out with his own version soon.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|ROOM is a sad book about a mother and young son held captive in a shed in their captor's back yard.  When they are free they spend time in a hospital and from there the boy goes to his Grandma's to live until his mother can recover from what appears to be an attempted suicide.<br />The book shows what can happen to a person when they are removed from the world and its surroundings.  It is sad and when the book ends, you have no idea whether the mother and son will get &#34;better&#34; and fit in.
B0054LVP3Q|4.0|I began reading this book a long time ago about a year ago. It seemed interesting enough but I wasn't really able to get into it. I started reading again once I had more time and wanted to finish it. The story is pretty good kind of unexpected which is good. However I felt it dragged on a lot more than I would have liked.<br /><br />I would recommend this to someone who is into this genre of novel. It is unlikely that I will reread it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far so good. I really can't complain about anything so far. The game is what it says it is.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good waste of time if your interested in games similar to sim city, just so far without the tax bs. Waste of time waste of time.
B007VWEEQQ|4.0|Purchased a 2013 Audi and have an android. This is what you need to play your music. Received quicker then I thought.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the whole series but liked this one better than number one.  The author was very creative and brave to write this story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a great game to play to pass the time. I've been playing it every single day since I got it (on Easter). If you like Temple Run you'll love Subway Surfers. It's very similar but Subway Surfers is better, making it feel like you're playing on a gaming console and not playing an app on your Kindle.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars because it started to lag out of nowhere, which bugs me because it gets me killed in the game.
0393927938|5.0|It came brand new, and was exactly what I was looking for. If you need the book  I suggest it
0307346617|4.0|World War Z is a great read. I was impressed with the narrative format. I was even moe impressed that the author didn't dumb down facts and history. You get a lot more out of this read if you are into world affairs and US history.
B00A812HOS|4.0|Unknown Mortal Orchestra, the Portland, OR-based band fronted by Ruban Nielson, turned in one of the biggest and pleasant surprises in 2011 with its excellent self-titled debut album, a strange but delightful left-of-center of power post-punk and ultimately hard-to-categorize muisc. Now comes the band's second album.<br /><br />\\"II\\" (10 tracks; 40 min.) starts off with a strangely subdued \\"From the Sun\\", making immediately clear that the exuberance of the debut album would take a back seat. \\"Swim & Sleep (Like a Shark)\\" is a bit more uptempo but equally pensive. Track 4 \\"One at a Time\\" is the first track where the power trio asserts itself in full-blown mode, and my favorite track for me on this album. The middle of the album is covered by the 3 longest tracks on here, an excellent 5 min. \\"The Opposite of Afternoon\\", with delicious guitar licks from Nielson, the raging \\"No Need for a Leader\\" and the 7 min. \\"Monki\\", a long and moody work-out. After a short 1 min. instrumental \\"Dawn\\" we get the last note-worthy track, a hard-charging \\"Faded In the Morning\\", reminiscent of the debut album.<br /><br />In all, this is quite a departure from the debut album, and in my opinion not as good, but still enjoyable. UMO has turned introspective on the second album, although there remain a number of great tracks that grabbed my attention. I caught UMO live here in Cincinnati when they toured in support of the debut album, and what a blazing set they brought, one of the best for me that year (2011). Can't wait to see these guys in concert again.

B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Admittedly it's been years since I watched Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho and after seeing it, I too took a hiatus from shower-taking for a year or so, just in case. This film about the making of Psycho and the Hitchcocks' relationship is very entertaining and as a fan of Hopkins, Mirren, and Johannsen, I recommend it to you without reservation. And so there are only two more things I can say say about the movie and here they are:<br /><br />Vera Miles was in Psycho?<br /><br />and<br /><br />If you need someone righteously told off, perhaps you should ask Helen Mirren to do it.<br /><br />Rent or purchase? A good choice either way, especially if you're a Hitchcock fan!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It kept me reading all day and all night. Jack sort of reminds me of the Spencer books  by Parker.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed The Language of Flowers and would not hesitate to recommend it, with reservations. It was well written, held my interest and was informative as well,  it only fell short in its credibility. I understand that a novel is a story, but a story well told ( in my opinion ) should have an element of believability, and portions of this book went far beyond the reasonable. Still, it was a very good read and it was the first full priced Kindle book I ever purchased and I did not regret it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This book kept me up all day and way into the night until I finished the whole thing. This one kept you guessing as to who was bad and who was good til the end.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I can usually tell a lot about a book in the first few paragraphs and so it was with Diane Setterfield's, The Thirteenth Tale. Her use of the English language is masterful and it only takes a a page or two to know that your time in this book will be well spent. As a man, this is not the kind of book I would normally read as it is in the high romance style of a Bronte classic, but a few pages in and I wouldn't have cared if she was handing out chicken soup recipes, the writing was just that good. The story makes use of a number of classic devices, always a plus in my book, but it's the writing that grabbed my attention and held it to the last page. If you love romance, this is a no-brainer, and even if you just want to hear what good writing sounds like, this is a gift of a book, a thoughtful graceful labor of love.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|It's like the author got tired of the whole saga and left everything up in the air; nothing was resolved at the end. He kills off some and the others? who knows, because he obviously didn't either.
0486423662|5.0|E. Nesbit is one of my favorite childhood authors and I remember school holidays spent comfortably ensconced in a chair reading her books (and those of Enid Blyton's). I thought it was about time I introduced my eight-year-old daughter and avid reader to the delights of Nesbit's works and bought several of Nesbit's books for her.<br /><br />\\"Five Children and It\\" is a classic tale of adventure featuring five children, i.e. Robert, Anthea, Jane, Cyril, and their baby brother. They decide to dig a hole through the Earth to discover if those living on the other side walk upside down. Imagine their shock and delight when they find a sand fairy called a Psammead (pronounced as Sammyadd). The Psammead's nature is to grant wishes, but he warns the children that the wishes granted will come undone at sunset. Naturally, with a bunch of gregarious youngsters, things are bound to go awry when wishes are not planned with precision and careful thinking!<br /><br />I recommend this delightful fantasy story for curious and imaginative children ages eight and up.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|(Spoiler alert) The main character dies at the end. This film was a little tedious on the dialogue and somewhat confusing in character development the first time around, especially since a lot of the scenes were shot in the area I live (Richmond, VA), it was confusing to see the Governor's mansion and state capitol building used as sets for northern establishments (not straight on that... and considering the film is supposed to be precise down to the minute details such as silverware and even beverages, I'm still not sure what was what and where it was supposed to be)<br />Though a few scenes seemed a little hokey in that signature Speilberg (insert John Williams sentimental score here) sort of way, it was a good story. The second time around (and it is worth seeing twice) the dialogue seemed more cohesive and coherant. It was also easier to lose Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones in their characters. The first time around I kept waiting for Day Lewis to say something about drinking milkshakes in that supposed highly researched tone of voice he used. I  feel like this film might have been better as a TV mini-series, like Lonsome Dove, so that the supporting characters could have been completely fleshed out creating empathy for them and so the historical context could have been more thourougly explored. Still, it is a drama, not a documentary even though it is based on actual events. It's definately worth watching...more than once if you have the time to spare.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I like the story with the big age difference between them and how much they were a<br /><br />Like and it was not a long story I enjoyed it very much
B00B49L7JY|2.0|I was expecting a documentary on some reclusive Jimi Hendrix type guy who everyone begged for more of, but shunned commercial success and decided to pursue a more altruistic lifestyle. I just did not see the comparisons to Bob Dylan or anything that great about the music snipets played here...and I was really trying. This stuff reminded me of the cheap music from the Pickwick label that bordered on muzak. Don't remember that record label or the music? Then why should you bother with this stuff?<br />  There have always been plenty of &#34;common man&#34; musicians out there...Jim Croce, Harry Chapin, Ritchie Havens, Joni Mitchell, Joan Armatrading, Phoebe Snow, Nina Simone... to name a few. During that late sixties-early seventies period, there were a lot of big and innovative changes going on in rock and roll music and this stuff just wasn't cutting it. Sure, Rodriguez seems like a nice enough man, with a nice family now, but at the time, he was trying to break into a cut throat business with plenty of talented carnage and one hit wonders being thrown to the wayside.<br />A big clue in this film is revealved in that Rodriguez doesn't seem to have written anything new since his failed short career as an American pop star. So he was a big hit in South Africa and he made some money doing a re-hash tour of 30 year old tunes there. Does that warrant a feature length documentary? I get the distinct impression that this movie was put together by a small group of people who are trying to create some fake hype to grift on a not so interesting topic. Obviously it worked because they got my $2.99, which is more than I would have paid had I known better. This is a mediocre human interest story at best.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|It was like getting inside FDR's head during the buildup to WWII.  I'm a product of the late '60s and never knew that young people organized against involvement in a European war just like we did against continuing involvement in a southeastern Asian war.  Nor did I imagine how doves of the late '30s became the hawks of my youth!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey is really amazing. I really enjoyed the blending of violin and dub step. My favorite song is Electric Daisy!
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This was a great movie with a great story line!!!  Would recommend this movie to all who want to see a movie with some meaning!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very good actors, never did I see someone out of their charactor. Great Drama, My wife and I watch season one on netflix for free, then we bought #2 #3 from Amazon, to bad the Amazon player was hinky and queing up funny as well as buffering a little to much.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Story starts out slow - many characters but all interwoven - takes an everyday situation and makes an interesting story about it.  Will be looking for more books for adults from Rowling.
0307346617|5.0|A lot of the reviewers giving this book three or fewer stars are the kind of people who want to get attached to a hero and follow him/her as they smash through hoards of zombies. This is not that kind of book. Instead, it is a history of humanity's greatest challenge, survival against an ultimate predator, and therefore draws voices from as many realistic segments of society. The character you follow is an abstract one- humanity's struggle to survive- and just like a flesh and blood character you get addicted to the initial confusion, fear, hopelessness, determination, and eventual success. Just because there is no single name to pin it own doesn't make it any less awesome.<br /><br />Yes there are elements of Brooks own ideology but any author who writes includes their own thoughts in some form. None of them are hugely offensive and if you find them so take a reality check- people exist with those ideas. Better learn to live with them.<br /><br />This was one if the scariest books I've ever read. Murder mysteries and zombie gore feast are more shocking then scary. This book is scary because if you replace zombies with any real sort of infectious disease, bird flu, SARS, H1N1, you really could see people reacting exactly how this book describes. And that, is scary.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|No mystery; not a common situation; interesting story line and at the end brought characters together for a sweet ending.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Helps with gramer and stuff I didn't really read it though just skimmed threw it too many pages And stuff.

B00985E3UG|3.0|SALT SUGAR FAT deserves the accolades it's receiving here on Amazon and elsewhere as a terrific piece of historical analysis of the processed foods industry.  But to be sure, it falls quite short of being the modern-day equivalent of Upton Sinclair's THE JUNGLE.<br /><br />On the plus side:  Moss' compulsively readable work is as close as we'll possibly get these days to investigative journalism on the topic of corporate malfeasance. The processed food oligopoly has devoted decades to using science and psychology to find an irresistible \\"bliss point\\" of sugar-salt-and-fat that makes chips, crackers, soda and other packaged foods subject to nothing short of addiction.<br /><br />When tobacco company Phillip Morris bought out Kraft (and then Nabisco in 2000), an entirely new paradigm in the marketing of processed foodstuff was established --- sell junk food to \\"heavy users\\" the same way nicotine is marketed to cigarette addicts.<br /><br />With this book, Moss assembled the comprehensive history of processed foods for the first time.  He did so through the oral history of over 300 professionals from Kraft, Coca-Cola, Kellogg, General Foods and other giants.  Some of these execs and food scientists feel guilty about their careers in manipulating the taste buds of the American public to win \\"stomach share\\" (and many others who are exceptionally proud of it). American consumers didn't stand a chance -- today's obesity epidemic is proof-positive of the success of the processed food conglomerates.<br /><br />(Interestingly enough, most of the processed food execs interviewed for this book DO NOT consume the products they put on the shelves for other Americans to gobble up.  Check out the story about Oscar Mayer's Lunchables product.)<br /><br />All in all, \\"SSF\\" is a book as irresistible as a Big Grab bag of Lays potato chips. But toward the end of the boo, the author falls short of its true potential. Part of this is attributable to the apparent editorial compromise Mossmade with processed food insiders to get the truth -- in part he endorses the conglomerates' perspective that they're just \\"giving the consumers what they want\\" -- products that have the perfect combination of sugar-salt-and-fat.<br /><br />The problem is that these products often are not food. They have no nutritional value. They have chemicals that trick the consumer's mind into the compulsive overeating.  They create levels of obesity society has never before experienced.<br /><br />More to the point, while Moss has the assembled the most compelling look backward on the topic of the history of the processed foods industry in America, the author completely sidesteps the clear and present dangers the industry poses to its consumers today.<br /><br />Not once does Moss take up the hot-button topic of Monsanto's genetically-modified Frankenfood crimes, the dangers of which the processed food conglomerates are desperately trying to hide from their consumers.  Also, strange new synthetic chemicals are being added to soft drinks and other processed foods with the endorsement of a laughably corrupt FDA.  For example, Google this: \\"Pepsi, Senomyx and fetal cells.\\"  Yikes.<br /><br />Arguably, Michael Moss could make the case that SSF was intended solely as a backward-looking work of the history of the processed food industry, and the scary new-age chemicals and additives they're putting in snacks and sodas today are the task of another writer.  Fair enough.  From that perspective, Moss' book is a phenomenal accomplishment -- one of the best and most important non-fiction books of recent years.<br /><br />That said, Moss should consider a sequel that addresses the current state of the processed food industry.  Today, obesity is the demonstrably byproduct of the last 50 years of the junk food industry.  Looking forward, it appears to be widespread cancer and organ failure.  With this omission, Moss' work fall short of his responsibility as an investigative journalist to provide an accounting of the full corruption of this industry, and its future impact on American society.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is pretty straightfoward.  I like it better than my web browser because it takes away all the excess clutter that the website sometimes have.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I so wish I had found this series at the beginning.  I hate paying for TV episodes.  Regardless, this is one of the most interesting and enjoyable series I have ever watched.  (No exaggeration).  The history (from the Titanic on), the social hierarchy, the historical costumes, household items, trains, vehicles, etc. is not to be missed.  Then you have all of the most interesting characters with perfect casting.  I am beyond hooked!  And Maggie Smith (I hope she lives to be 100), well... I love her to death.  She is truly a treasure.  Don't hesitate, just start at the beginning and be prepared to enjoy yourself!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game!!! Best bingo around I think.  It has bingo and slots with new stuff coming out all the time.  It does have more glitches than most but they are always aware and fixing.  They usually respond to your issues also.  Definitely recommend!!
B000I9S64U|5.0|Intrigujing story, excellent acting and special effects.<br />The novel was fascinating and compelling, and this movie captures the spirit and story of the novel well.<br />I have watched this movie numerous times, and now I own it. I will watch it again.<br />Highlyh recommended for Sci-fi fans.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. You never finish, just keep playing and playing. You don't have to pay anything if you wait until your meter fills up.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|I decided to get this movie because I didn't get to see it in the theater (mainly because the storyline didn't enthrall me to want to see it), but after it won an Oscar for best picture, I figured I may have misjudged it.<br /><br />Well, I should've known better and stuck with my original judgement.  I mean, it wasn't bad at all, but I wasn't hanging at the edge of my seat like alot of others seemed to experience.  And normally, I buy a movie because I expect to watch it again and again.  Unfortunately for me, this is only a one-time viewing.  I probably should've waited for this to appear on NetFlix.  Maybe I can re-gift it as a stocking stuffer for Christmas...
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I liked the book better but this movie is true for the most part to the book. Great acting, plot, suspense and special effects
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Vintage Nicholas Sparks.  a quick read that holds your interest  but doesn't leave you with a whole lot of emotions or feelings.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This second book in the trilogy started off rather slow with Katniss heading back home after the Games and the start of the uprisings. The book really hits the ground running halfway through the book. You need to get your hands on this one, Katniss finally grows up a bit.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|READ THE BOOK AND LOVED IT! THE MOVIE FOLLOWED THE STORY BUT LACKED SOME OF THE DETAIL.<br />THE BOAT SEEMED TOO SMALL TO ME. THE TRAINING OF THE TIGER COULD OF BEEN PLAYED UP<br />MORE.
B003TXSF5C|3.0|I appreciate the material Stephen Hawking presents; the other author injects reader &#34;friendly&#34; words that are almost non-sensical.  They are poor examples of the physics Stephen is trying to inject into the reader and provide a choppy read.
B00A83075M|5.0|A great movie for both kids and adults! A movie that roots for the under dog! Definitely a Go See!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is just like using face book on my iphone.  You have to tap on the comments to see what people are saying.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|Multitalented musician. Will be breaking out soon. Great buy. Will not be disappointed. Hendricks would be proud of his cover.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love to use Pintrest on the tablet.  Nice to have it mobile, but a bigger picture than what I have on the iPhone
B009IH0ICG|5.0|This product arrived on time and works great. Perfect and affordable. I would recommend to anyone. Could be a little taller to hold more coals but it works great.
B00BKBCF38|1.0|This band is the epitome of what it means to be uncool. Hyped beyond belief and why? Because they have a goofy image. The music is simply retro-wuss rock. It's been done before 10x better.<br /><br />Just like today's \\"pop\\" music this band is all gimmicks and visuals. Strip away the Halloween masks and you have a weak slab of mush music. There's no way this band would even be known without the costumes and the Satan shtick. Musically they are lame. Britney Spears sells sex. Ghost B.S. sells Satanic nonsense.
B002WN35DC|1.0|Apenas vi este libro, lo compre inmediatamente sin revisar comentarios, con la emoci&oacute;n de compartir con mis dos hijos uno de mis libros favoritos de la infancia. Hoy en la noche Me sent&eacute; con ellos para tener nuestro rato de lectura y cual es mi sorpresa... Realmente nunca se me ocurri&oacute; que alguien podr&iacute;a quitar las ilustraciones de este libro. Sin ellas no tiene ningun sentido.<br /><br />No entiendo si es un error de publicaci&oacute;n, un error de servidor o un error de transferencia, lo que si les puedo decir que es un gran error comprar este libro digital sin las ilustraciones.
B000FA675C|4.0|I had already read the book and they moved the library so that I can not longer get to it, so I bought the book. The book collection in my Kindle is always a pleasant shock. The fact that I simply love all the books in my kindle is just icing on the cake!
B000FA675C|5.0|Any time I can read something and it keeps me guessing right up until the end and then I'm still going....wow! didn't see that coming is a joy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another can't put it down book from follett. Wonderful storytelling from three different perspectives about our not too distant history. I can't wait for the third book
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Very well done. Directing and play write we're fantastic!  After reading the book, I was very impressed. It deserves 5 stars.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I love this book! I wish this could be required reading for graduation from high school. The world would be a much better place for it.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  I thought the actors were great.  Jamie Foxx is a really cool dude.  Christoph Waltz was smart and sympathetic.  Leonardo DiCaprio was pure evil.  And Samuel L Jackson was not far behind Leonardo!  The music fit the different sections of the movie beautifully.  It kept me glued to my seat.  Not one false note!  There is bad language, a little nudity, a LOT of violence, so not appropriate for young children.
B001NTXHU2|5.0|living through the 60-70's this brought back a time that I will always remember foundly and the sound is like no other...
B00915G6SU|5.0|I started watching crimal minds on reruns and found it to be a great show so I ordered all the dvd's and watched from season 1 thur 7 and I really love this show really can't wait untill season 8 comes out I really don't watch a lot of t.v but this show really is great.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is a great game with beautiful graphics and lots of fun challenges in the same vein as the other Temple Run games.  It is very much like the movie as well.  My grandkids have nearly lost themselves in the game.  A delight!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|this app is really good. only idf you got more time. I love the actual game but it costs 4bucks!!! dunno what to do
B004U52VPS|4.0|Great game to get if you want to get your kids off the Ipad and physically playing the game.  Lots of different ways to set up the towers with the blocks and fun to knock them down.  I actually think it is more fun than the game on the pad.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Once again Jo Nesbo compels me to skip bathroom breaks, hold my breath and remind myself that I'm reading from a Kindle<br /> and I can't skip ahead to see what happens next.  I have read as many of Nesbo's books as I can get my hands on and have always been intrigued, excited and enthralled.
B000002LSV|4.0|I bought this CD for my husband he likes more of the music on it than I do Rough Boy is the track I like the rest is his fave.
B008M87GJK|5.0|No &#34;screaming headlines&#34;, no teasing headlines, no &#34;drama&#34; in the reporting.  Videos are very good.  Apps is well organized. Good job.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|My favorite Doctors of all time are Tom Baker and David Tennant.  But Matt Smith has a new interesting approach to Doctor Who Series the show still keeps you on your toes after all these years and just keeps getting better all the time.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My children have had a blast playing with these. They have taken them apart and put them back together several times.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Can't go wrong with Classic Julie Andrews.  And a spoon full of sugar really does help the medicne go down.  Fun movie great imagination. Disney classic.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|I just can't get past Maggie caring for Laurent. He is deceitful, etc. No amount of good looks and French charm should be enough to make an intelligent woman carry on a relationship with one such as he. Not falling for it.
B000002LFZ|5.0|The whole CD is great.  Reminds me of good friends when we use to listen to this music when it was popular.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This Buddy works great and I can now communicate legally while I drive.  Don't call that  much but when I have to I feel safer.  Love it!  More people should get and use them!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I had a hard time playing this, and so after the first few rounds, I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again. I feel like the game was very unforgiving of how quickly you responded. I've now deleted it, as I didn't really enjoy playing.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|The writing keeps you on the edge at times. The descriptive narratives draw you in. Good reading that moves at a good pace.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Tired of listening to politicians and media experts re-hash all the problems with American manufacturing and mind numbing dissertations on what needs to be done to fix it. Read this book it is well written,  fun and highlights the facts that show manufacturing is alive and well.<br />There are many practical examples and suggestions that can be used by anyone wanting to be  part of this New Industrial Revolution.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Takes a little getting used to but a great app for Kindle Fire.  Once used to operating it on the Kindle, it's lots of fun.
0545101425|5.0|Audio books can be tricky unless you get a narrator who knows how to do it well and this one does. I'm glad I ordered it. I'll most likely pick up the two earlier books in audio form too.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it! Easy to use -really happy with it! Would definitely recommend for anyone who likes to read -easy to bookmark and has alot of useable features
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice graphics, quick updates. It's a nice app but it's not as good as the weather channel's which I use daily
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is great and hopefully will help Jaycee in the long run.  It helps the public to understand what she went through and how difficult life became for her. My heart goes out to her and her daughters.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I liked Lord of the Rings better ,but my wife says I should have gave it a five star, but it's a good flick worth seeing
B000QUCNXG|4.0|Good but left you hang at the end could have told us what he took out of his pocket at the end.
B004AO1FF6|5.0|This is by far my favorite companion so far. She loves him but isnt smitten by him its much more of a partnership.
B005ZUR724|4.0|great wow mock on portable devices. very intiuitive. its better on iOS devices. i wish my girlfriend played. mendels rule. graphics are on point. needd more players on kindle fire tesr coast. sick game overall
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Anyone with military experience will not be amazed by this tale.  Anyone who can write English will be appalled at how this has been written.  Anyone who is not American (and many who are I suspect) will find the gung ho, pro American, blinkered perspective scary.  If you really like guns (maybe US Senators would appreciate this?!) then there may be something in this for you.  Not worth spending your money or time on this otherwise.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Okay, Kelly fans.  This is a good compilation of mostly her early works, although it included the Jason Aldean duet.  This is a nice blend of her crossover style............a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll!
B00B22IJXK|2.0|If you absolutely have the obsessive need to draw all over pictures you take on your phone by \\"painting\\" or \\"drawing\\" with your finger, then this is the app for you! Otherwise, this is a complete waste of time.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz Scaggs newest album has all the great qualities you expect from Scaggs since he was a lead singer with Steve Miller Band.  Vocals are exceptionally clear and music selection is fabulous.  Background musicians are high quality; this album is five star in every respect.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Ok, not great. Would wait till out on regurlar TV or some sort of free service. Don't rent this mess.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game needs more ratings if like this game try bike race or temple run and a lot more hamsters just Kayla [...]
B0094K1WZE|3.0|The title of this review says it all. It's an action movie that doesn't hold you in suspense at all. Of course, if you're in love with Tom Cruise then you'd want to watch it. Don't lose sleep over missing this movie if you haven't seen it. I waited until I could view this movie for free and if you saw it in the theatre you'd probably wish you had your money back.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I was so sad at the end of the Percy Jackson series. But now i see that the story continues on. And it includes more heroes! Very good read. But it would be hard to understand this series without reading the Percy Jackson one prior.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This was a very good movie but I thought it was a little slow.  I love horse movies but hate military movies so this was a mix of both.  I watched it the day i received it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|doesn't show picture. of object just shadow.. I guess that's what makes it challenging but its an okay game ...
B000003N7F|5.0|I pondered this purchase for years. Recently I undertook a series of upgrades to my audio system. I've been a serious jazz fan since the '60s. I bought it in vinyl. Certainly, I understood going in what this masterpiece represented. I have not been dissapointed, it's everything that I had hoped for. As far as the content is concerned, it's otherworldly. As far as the production is concerned, as good as it gets.
1250007208|4.0|The cover art of the hardback edition originally attracted my attention to this story. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that this is a retelling of the Cinderella fairy tale and as such, the plot is fairly predictable. You know from the getgo that Cinder is much more than even she knows, you know the Prince is going to be a love interest, and you know there's the obligatory \\"evil stepmother\\". What's noteworthy about this is the truly clever wrapping around the tale - Cinder as a cyborg in a post-apocalyptic (we've passed World War FOUR in this timeframe) world where new prejudices exist, where \\"our enemies, our friends\\" are Lunars - yes, from the moon - and androids are much, much more than operating systems for our phones. There's a plague ravaging the Earth as well, for additional tension, and it's a well-thought-out plot twist which serves to further the revelations of Cinder's true identity.<br /><br />I'm in my mid-50s and I thoroughly enjoyed this book - sci-fi and old fairy tales? Turns out they meld very well together to create a story that you really can't put down; I really wanted to see what happens next in spite of the existing story framework. There's a lot going on in this book, which ends in a delightful cliffhanger - I can't wait to pick up the story again in \\"Scarlet\\" (which I ordered while I was only midway through THIS book) and see where Miss Meyer's creative turn of mind goes next :)
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|The first 30 minutes were dreadful!  The next 2 hours I was waiting for the end.  That is all this one deserves.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was my Book Club's selection for last month.  I had never heard of the book and, quite frankly, the title didn't make me want to dive in.  So I was surprised at how much I liked this book.  It is very well written, has engaging characters, a good story, and I loved all I learned about flowers.  I did find that it bogged down just a bit in the middle (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars), but that is my only criticism. I would definitely recommend The Language of Flowers.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Great Series-I missed a lot of the beginning shows, nice to get caught up and even rewatch others I've missed
B00BBW16HW|4.0|This film celebrates feeling, compassion, growth and so many emotions, including humor.  For us the subtitles were a bonus and added to the understanding which just hearing the dialog in English would not have accomplished.  We would see this one again!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A good read ,a thriller ,surprising and enjoyable. This was a good book couldn't put it down  all I can say is wow<br /><br />E.childs1935@comcast.net
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Beautifully written and engaging story. Rushed through the last chapters because I couldn't wait to see how it would end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|it was a good but sad season it was kinda of a bummer for me cause of who they let get killed at the end.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|It pains me to write a negative review of a literature-based period drama, but this movie was awful. The movie is set up as a play. What do I mean by this? Well, scene changes occur with &#34;stagehands&#34; in costume changing the scenery, occasional views of gas lamp footlights, etc. It could have been charming, but I found it heavy-handed and distracting. Additionally, there were too much story. This amount of plot points could have filled a mini-series, which is probably a better venue for a Russian novel such as this.
B0029O08WA|3.0|The CD saw sent to me fairly quickly, but the last 5 songs on the CD sometimes start skipping when played.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is additicting! ! I cant not stop playing it! if you are looking for a game to okay in the car at a restront this game!!
B000JMKNV0|2.0|I appreciate the economic incentive for a popular author to publish easily adaptable material, but what passes for depth in a two-hour film comes across as shallow and slight in the printed word.  In the case of Shutter Island, the cinematic pacing and dialogue fall flat on paper, as does the &#34;big reveal&#34; which an attentive readers will have sorted out well in advance.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game it is the best game of there's so far just how they have it layer out going through different ages is amazing
B00BMKDTNC|1.0|Thank goodness for kindle, I would have hated to have actually spent so much money on such a shallow book. This was a 900 page book with two-thirds of it dedicated to opposing sides hacking away at each other. There was no real character maturation, just fighting. The conclusion for each main character that remained alive was.... Well, there really wasn't any. A paragraph, maybe two, for each person with a shallow and rather glib &#34;life goes on&#34; ending line.  Even the wrap-up of loose threads, such as Fain, were treated as an afterthought.<br /><br />This was such a fantastic series, it is so sad it had to end on such a disappointing note. The real losers of the Last Battle are the fans and readers who have waited so patiently, only to be charged for an epic snore.
0316182060|5.0|If you love the Parasol Protectorate, this is a fun way of enjoying the trip to Scotland. Can't wait for the next!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|well. on my temple run 2 every time I go to play it. it starts all over. it doesn't save my progress and it always tells me how to do things. but it doesn't save my progress! and every time I die it just freezes! so I have to exit out and restart. in which it used to work perfectly fine but idk what happened
157421327X|5.0|I loved what I saw of it. I haven't had an opportunity to fully appreciate it, because it and my best friend left together and I've not seen the book since. Since my art consist of markmaking and doodling, I think it would be of help with new ways to explore marks and shapes. The brief encounter I had with it gave me the impression that it would be a fun, enteraining and creative way to pass the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and enjoyable. If you enjoy games with animals or competition,  this game is for you!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my go to game when I have time to sit down for mindless tasks.  You do need to think ahead, otherwise the game is over in a flash and you lost.  I would recommend this game.  It lets you chose your skill level.
B00991TCOG|5.0|She is very talented and the music is wonderful. I also made others listen to her cd and they loved and bought it as well.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Good read. Good characters. Sometimes a little to detailed on insignificant stuff which slows you down but definitely a good storyline.  On to book 3 to see how it all ends.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Product took 6-7 weeks to arrive to my address. Product also broke within the first month or so of having obtained it.<br />Cheap price. Cheap quality.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I use my Twitter all day every day. I so happy I now can see it bigger and have available at all times. thanks
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Great read and a lot to be learned from this organization and Mr Kelly and Mr Rich's management style, hopefully the Govt. will keep this National treasure, the Skunk Works alive with its imagination fully  functioning.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Would recommend this game. I have found this game very relaxing and fun.  It is fun for all ages.  LOVE IT
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Kids loved it, me and hubby like as well. It was funny, action, romance, all in one and even a cartoon so the kids can watch too.
030758836X|1.0|I found this book to be too wordy without saying anything important which found me skimming through much and being most disappointed in the ending.
B007REV4T8|5.0|My husband is a James Bond fan and I got this for his collection. We enjoyed this movie more than the previous ones with Daniel Craig. There were more references to the classic Bond films and I enjoyed the pacing more (some of the other ones move to fast or there is to much action on screen and I just get dizzy).
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a fun game.  The graphics are great.  The hint progression is just the right amount.  I can't wait for the next chapter.  Well worth the money.
B00C4SUEJI|3.0|Sometimes less is more.<br /><br />While Sam Beam is by all accounts a brilliant, hyper-creative arranger/producer, these arrangements, this production simply doesn't play to his personal strengths as a musician and performer. It seems he wants to sing with his full voice now. For some, that's the better choice, but Sam's voice is actually much MORE emotive when hushed and lilting. Likewise, his songs are MORE compelling when sparsely arranged. \\"Kiss Each Other Clean\\" and now \\"Ghost On Ghost\\" remind me of Nick Drake's \\"Bryter Layter\\" album, good songs from a great artist weakened by over-arrangement. Here's hoping Sam still has a \\"Pink Moon\\" up his sleeve.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Another easy listening CD. I enjoy this man's music very much.<br />I have most of his CD's, and this is one I will keep.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|With all the hype I had no intentions of reading this series. I am so happy a friend encouraged me to read, it is well worth the time. We all should be fortunate to experience what these main characters have together. Read it, you'll enjoy it'
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|After seeing the movie &#34;Love in Portofino&#34; I just had to buy this CD. It is wonderful.<br />I am a great fan of Andrea Bocelli, have all his CD's. Have also seen him live in<br />Melbourne Australia. A completely moving experience. He puts such passion into his music.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband and daughter since they both loved it at the movie theatre. I didn't think this would<br />be my kind of movie, well I was wrong. Funny and very light-hearted. I would definitely recommend.  Good price.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show.... Heartbroken by the finale.... Can't wait for Season 4 this fall. Just wish there were more episodes per season...
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Don't know what to expect from this movie, but I guess I'll just have to find out and watch this Blueray ...
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|If one enjoys aviation and aviation combat as well as human interest stories this is a must read.  A very well written non-fiction book.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|This is an awesome concert.... I finally got this on Blueray and Im hoping hell freezes over is transferred to Blueray too...guys... Gotta get this concert in your collection....
B0033WDCRA|5.0|I purchased this based on others reviews, I am so glad I did. I can be in my car listening to this and picture being back in high school but now with a better car. LOVE THE FEELING THIS CD GIVES ME!!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this one because it is user friendly and I can even do it while on the phone or when I have only a few minutes to kill
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love it creative cute sweet. just dont like how they always try to get you to buy packs. just play longer and you ull get ther
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I enjoyed the second book most. I was disappointed with the end of the series. Lauren Oliver may as well have just put an ellipsis at the end of pandemonium.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I really like the intensity of this show..Kevin Bacon is always a favorite..Would really like to understand the motives of the cult thing..great show keep it coming..
1423140605|5.0|This was a gift for Christmas for my grandson and I know that he loved it as well as all the other books I got him.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|I managed to see the movie twice; once in a more official theater and once in a dollar theater. When I saw it the second time, I knew I could jump to the moment with the heroine and her steed backed up by a nice song (don't remember the title) in the DVD. Maybe even enjoy the deleted scenes in the second disc (the BLU-Ray one)<br /><br />Turns out this, alongside, Fantasia, Pocahontas & Mulan, instead of The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time have been arranged so one DVD is separate, but the BLU-Ray ones \\"must\\" be packaged with the same DVD!<br /><br />Those who have a system with videos that don't concern such a strange combo pack get said combo pack for Christmas and the separate single DVD (as a separate present from someone naïve), either use \\"Windows Movie Maker\\" and video capture tool [[ASIN:B004GHHVWI Pinnacle Dazzle DVC 100 DVD Recorder]] to get and store the bonuses in the BLU-Ray discs as WMV files and keep the standard one, or get a package for DVDs but is empty, place the standard DVD in it for a donation or sale and keep the rest of the combo pack.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I had high hopes after the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I wasn't sure Peter Jackson would be able to repeat the feeling again. He pulled it off, once again I was amazed to feel like I had just stepped into the world created by Tolkien. Great movie.
142311339X|5.0|This too, along with about 20 other books, was on my 10-year-old grandson's Christmas list and he has read all of them. So, it must have been good since he has read all of them in less than three months!!
B00B0NDF26|4.0|Tegan and Sara have successfully made a transition what would (has) destroy many a lesser band.<br /><br />Changing styles from an alternative rock sound to a more synth pop sensibility (like Fun. or Group Love), Tegan and Sara are still able to make their album work in a big way. Although, I still miss the grittier style of earlier &#34;If It Was You&#34;, &#34;Hearthrob&#34; never feels artificial. Not to mention there are more than a few catchy ear-worms. Most of this success can only be attributed to one thing: Tegan and Sara are dead-ringers as songwriters.
1423140591|5.0|This too was on my grandson's list for Christmas list and he already read it, so it mush have been great!
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|We had seen all the commercials on this movie, but did not see it when it came through our town, so I surprised the wife and purchased it as a gift. We both loved it.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Enough plot twists and strange happenings too keep it interesting and fun, literary puzzles that turn out completely different to what you expect - a nice twist on a genre. Fun!

B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Phosphorescent (Matthew Houck), and love the fact that he never puts out the same record twice. If you loved \\"Pride\\" but haven't follwed him since, this may not be your cup of tea. And vice versa... an introduction to his music via \\"Muchacho\\" will not necessarily lead to love of his earlier work. He's introducing electronics here in a big way, but not in an abrasive way. The synth sounds he chooses to incorporate do not battle with his acoustic guitar or other more traditional folk instruments, but accent them, and in some cases (such as the jaw-dropping \\"Song For Zula\\"), sculpt them into something entirely new.<br /><br />It's only April, but seriously, come December if there's a song that's impressed me more than \\"Song For Zula,\\" well, somebody's gonna have to do something pretty damb amazing to come up with a better song of the year. Between the undulating Philip Glass strings, the immediately recognizable melody, and Matt's cracking voice wrapping itself around one of the most harrowingly contradictory lyrics ever written... it's almost exhaustingly beautiful and achingly sad. Self-affirming triumph and absolute emotional desolation collide savagely here, and the ending is not a happy one. It's not for the timid, but the rewards of a song like this are enormous. Houck has had some starkly soul-bearing moments in his career (\\"My Dove, My Lamb\\" comes to mind), but this song raises the bar to new heights.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the rest of the CD is really good too....
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I had very little expectations that I would like this book when I decided to try it.<br /><br />I was drawn in very unexpectedly after the first page!<br />The author's writing style drew me in and never let go. I can honestly say that this is one of a handful of books that is a lifetime favorite. I am 60 years old and have read over 100 books per year since I was a young child.<br /><br />I just purchased the kindle edition even though I also own the hardcover as I want to re-read it from time to time and I now prefer reading on my kindle. I don't recall reading a book more than once before until now!
B001B1876G|4.0|The cartoon lived up to its name. They are more grown-up cartoons than for children. The plot the characters was done very well. The animation and drawing were excellent. Definitely a winner.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The author did an excellent job with the Fifty Shades trilogy.  I could not put them down--I read them on my Kindle so no one would see the books in my hand and therefore, judge me....  My good friend was given the three books for the purpose of passing them on to another family member.  She ended up reading all three and stated that each one of them was trash.  I have a difficult time understanding why...if she came to this conclusion after reading the first one, why did she continue to read the other two.  If these books were written by a man, I might not have been interested.  However, I had seen an interview on TV and read about women's book clubs reading the series and really enjoying them, so I thought what the heck.  When I got my Kindle, the trilogy was at the top of my reading list.  I just wish my husband would have been interested in reading them with me...if you know what I mean.  Excellent plot and suspenseful and all nicely tied together.  I highly recommend this trilogy!  Thank you E.L. James for your work on this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was simply an amazing book. I loved it. But I wish we knew what happened to Gale. Katniss had a hard decision to make: Peeta or Gale? Did Gale ever love anyone else like he loved Katniss?
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book had a slow start, but as I continued reading, I feel it all tied together nicely and revealed why the main character was &#34;The Misremembered Man&#34;.  I'm glad I continued to read this book as the author did a good job of weaving the characters together and apart.  It had the right amount of humor and tragedy.  As I reached the end of the book, Ms McKenna had me biting my nails in suspense and dread! I was very pleased to have read this book--and really enjoyed it.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I think this book is good because of the suspense. When Percy disappeared I was crying hysterically. I also dwelt really bad for Annabeth too. But then they found each other. L8er when Annabeth had to leave it was so sad. But then Percy Jackson came to her rescue. The entire book was so good I was praying to/ the Gods and Goddesses that they would be O.K. This is by far the best book I've read in a long time. GREEK FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!

B008YKRRI6|5.0|October 1957 must have seen an alignment of the planets or something: in that month alone, Klemperer and the Philharmonia, with producer Walter Legge and balance engineer Robert Gooch, set down the heart of what we now think of as Klemperer's stereo Beethoven Symphony cycle -- numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 were set down, and number 9 was done the following month.  Numbers 3, 5, and 7 had been done in mono sound in 1955 and would be redone in stereo in 1959-60.  The standard view is that the mono 3, 5, and 7 are preferable to the stereo remakes, and they're certainly fine, but there isn't a whole lot in it as far as I'm concerned.  The great thing about this bargain box is that we have them ALL -- as well as a late 1968 Seventh, and a bunch of overtures, some in both mono and stereo -- on ten discs for little more than $4.00 a disc.  When you consider that this is all the work of a distinguished conductor, great orchestra, and stellar recording team, you should seriously consider getting it.<br /><br />The sound is amazingly vivid, with a presence and detail that one just doesn't get in the estimable performances from Szell (early 1960's) or Jochum (early 1970's).  Add to that Klemperer's ability to give depth and weight to his orchestral sound without loss of energy and forward momentum.  One gets the sense that here is a conductor who has a very clear idea about what he wants and knows how to get it.  These are very confident performances. And when one considers what was done in October 1957, one can imagine an orchestra on its toes and energized by the intensity of the work that it's undertaking in short order.  All the performances are worthy of attention, so I'll just make a few comments: In the First, we're in Beethoven's own sound world in the first movement.  The other movements sound a bit like Haydn (and none the worse for that) but the first movement tells us that this is the man who would compose the Fifth.  The Sixth is simply a great performance, catching the rustic spirit perfectly.  Its third movement is slower than Szell's and even Bohm's, and it sounds just right.  The horns are glorious there too.  The other movements are lovingly shaped -- no other word for it -- and the solo instruments are right on.  3, 5, and 7 are great performances too -- I still think Kleiber's 5 and 7 are extra special, but these are great.  Klemperer's way with the Funeral March in the Third is simply glorious.  The Fourth in Klemperer's view doesn't sound like a slender Greek maiden between two Nordic giants (one commentator once said something like that!).  Instead, it's in the world of the Fifth, and receives a weighty and shapely performance.  The very opening is played straight, in contrast to the rather creepy magic that Jochum conjured up there.  8 and 9 are fine, though there are recordings with other conductors that are just as good and with more consistent soloists.  I prefer Karajan's 1970's Eighth and Abbado's Sony Ninth.<br /><br />Of recent Klemperer boxes I now own this one, the \\"Concertos\\" box, and the Romantic Symphonies box.  I can't stress enough that these are ALL worth hearing, especially at these very reasonable prices.he rustic spirit perfectly.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This title was absolutely amazing. I, just like many of you, have the ability to get this movie free from people we know , or the net. But I commend any and everybody who loves kids to buy this movie. Support them because they might spit out another movie just like it. This was one of the best digital 16 dollars I ever spent. The movie had you believing one way and at the end completely blew your mind . Five stars is an under rating.

B00B935SUY|5.0|Growing up with the rock n roll of the 70's and 80's, I knew this would interest me.  It's really an ode to making music, doesn't really matter what kind, just happens to be rock n roll.  Grohl shares his passion for making music, collaborating with others using old school console technology that brings out true musicianship and doesn't substitute for it. (I find it particularly interesting since my 12 year old kid is obsessed with dubstep and Skrillex).  There's a who's who of rock legends in this film and the jam session at the end had me bouncing on the couch!  So cool.  Discovered a new found appreciation for Mr. Grohl, a multi-talented musician and devoted music fan.  Language aside (I mean, c'mon these are rock n rollers), I want to play some clips for my 12 year old son, a piano student, especially the part with Trent Reznor (newfound respect for this guy too)......those piano lessons might pay off kid!

I found it interesting and informative, and there are some beautiful passages about love and literature that I know I'll go back to. It also moved me to read Rushdie's prize-winning novel.
B00130UFY2|4.0|best of the series. usually tough to follow up one good movie with a sequal but this takes it one further and out does the first two
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|First I would recommend if you haven't already get part 1 (also if you have both CD cases it makes the House of gold and bones)<br /><br />This whole album is great but my personal favorite songs are Black John, Gravesend, Do me a favor, and The house of gold and bones.<br /><br />I would also Recommend HoGaB Comic book written by Corey Taylor and Published by Dark Horse Comics. It covers the short story that goes with the albums.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I love this book so much. It was happy and sad and inspiring!!! To anyone I would recommend this book. It is one of the best books I have read! It was brilliantly written to play with your emotions, and make you feel like you are in the book mourning for the characters!!!!

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I 've watched every Bond movie multiple times.  They have a habit of being flashy, but certain Bond characters are much better than others.  For me, Connery is Bond, Roger Moore is a decent Bond, Peirce Bronson was ok, but too thin and Timothy Dalton was a disaster.  On her Majesties Secret Service Bond who's name escapes me was awesome as well.  This new guy Daniel Craig is more like a Jason Borne character, but now that he's aging, he makes one fantastic Bond.  I loved this movie.  The next Bond should be the English accented guy currently playing opposite of Emily in the TV Series Revenge.  He will make a great Bond.  I hope someone in the right position takes notice of that guy.  He's worth looking up if you don't know who I'm talking about.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's a good read anyway, except for the names one has to keep track of, but Kindle has the x-ray feature to refer to help one keep track.
B007REV4YI|2.0|This is the third of the new Bond movies, and my least favorite by far.  It lacks the usual warmth, humor and sex appeal of the Bond franchise.  It also lacks the star power of a criminal mastermind. There are no outstanding, memorable characters in this film at all.<br />The trend of making the Bond franchise completely sexless has continued.  The director made one half-hearted attempt at a sexy scene in a shower, but it was completely sanitized for your protection and over quicker than a Saturday night at the preacher's house.  It wouldn't even make a Quaker blush.  I guess it's ok to show a human body torn into pieces by bullets, but God forbid we should see a naked breast.<br />Also continued is the casting of no-names as supporting actors.  The only bright point in the movie is newcomer Naomie Harris as Moneypenny.  Unfortunately, the new Q is a pathetic and entirely forgettable little twerp, twice as arrogant but half as clever as he thinks he is.  He has all the appeal of wet cardboard and gets completely played by the villain.  Sadly, he survives.<br />The biggest villain in this movie is definitely the script.  The story started out strong but completely fell apart.  There were huge missed opportunities and holes in the plot.  For example, the villain went through years of planning just to show up at a conference with two buddies and a handgun?  That's the big climax?  No holding the world hostage, no WMDs?  Pretty pathetic.  When he escapes through the subway, the chase scene is a complete snore until Bond catches up.  But it would have been 1,000 times more impressive if the director had done the scene the same way they did the opening escape sequence of Indiana Jones running from the falling rock in the tomb in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It would have made a much bigger impact to see Bond running from a runaway train like that, instead of just a simple crash.  A wasted chance, if you ask me.<br />But the ultimate kiss of death for Skyfall was that there were far too many contrived scenes.  By the end it was obvious that everyone from the director to the screenwriter and even the actors were all just mailing it in.  In one example, the head of MI6 is under threat of terrorist attack, but they only assign one agent and one fat guy for her protection.  Then later, when the villain shows up for the final confrontation, he isn't eager to get in the house and kill... giving M enough time to escape and Bond enough time to plan a nasty surprise. I found myself wishing that they would just kill M already- the witch truly deserved it for betraying one of her agents, after all. But it got worse.  Take the scene when the villain caught Bond while running across a frozen pond covered with thin ice... What were the options?  One, you could just gun him down. Two, you could shoot the ice and send him into the frozen water to drown. So of course it's option three- one of the henchmen walks out onto the ice, close enough for Bond to grab his machine gun and shoot a hole in the ice and escape.  Everyone knows the best way to cover someone with an automatic weapon is from only inches away, after walking out onto thin ice.  That was just stupid.  Finally, Bond shows up to kill the villain by throwing a giant knife into his back, one that appeared mysteriously out of nowhere.  Perhaps the Lady in the Lake gave it to him when she rescued him from drowning, which is the only way anyone could have escaped death after falling into that frozen pond, BTW. I won't even mention the underwater struggle in which Bond choked his victim to death with his knee and still had breath enough to swim 25 feet up to the surface in sodden winter clothing...What is this, Harry Potter?<br />I certainly didn't find myself wishing I were in Bond's place after this movie, as I have done in the past.  There was no awe, no hero worship. But without the charm and the reckless savoir-faire made famous by the previous Bonds, you don't have a hero anymore.  All you have left is an annoying little prick-ly toad. That is my impression of Daniel Craig as Bond after this movie.  I won't be falling for anymore hype from this group.

1476719071|4.0|I never understand these women. They meet a guy who has a certain reputation and become their \\"friends.\\" Yet, while they are building these friendships, they end up seeing these guys for who they truly are deep inside...see all their insecurities, their fears, their hearts. Then they become defensive of them when others say something about their new \\"male friend.\\" Yet, for all the caring they developed, all the time they invested and all the good they see in the person, no level of how they feel when they are with their \\"friend\\" ever truly resonates deep enough with these girls to truly have them GET A CLUE...<br /><br />Abby was no different. She spent time with Travis...then loses a bet and spends more time with Travis...they build a friendship...and while he is developing feelings, and deep down she feels something too, she continues to play the WE ARE JUST FRIENDS game and sits back while he continues behaving the way he always has. And while it seems that others around him are more unhappy with his behavior than Abby is, that all sort of changes as things begin to progress.<br /><br />Now, enter the game changer stage left...another guy. Travis can hardly handle this new person in Abby's life, which coupled with the fact their \\"arrangement\\" was coming to an end, and he is completely beside himself.<br /><br />But Abby is determined in her very young, naive state to keep pushing him away. Her past haunts her, he reminds her of things best forgotten and left out of her life and she is hellbent on making sure it remains that way.<br /><br />And just when you think she is set in her position, Travis chips away at her resolve. But that doesn't last long.<br /><br />This is a back and forth emotional rollercoaster caused solely by Abby, who pretty much deserved all of the pain she endured. She did not handle much of any of the relationship properly, but rather just vanished, leaving Travis alone drowning in concern and uncertainty...she ignored him and told him morethan once that it was OVER and to move on. But then he tries to, reverting back to the only existence he has ever known that never left him brokenhearted, which clearly left a bitter taste in Abby's mouth.<br /><br />This was a book drenched in BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR FOR BECAUSE YOU JUST MIGHT GET IT. Abby kept pushing Travis away. Her behavior was pathetic, at best, but fortunately for her, Travis had a lingering memory of a conversation from the only other woman who ever mattered to him. Without those words, he may very well have had a different approach to Abby, her irrational behavior, her demands and his love for her.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book because I enjoyed watching Travis open up and begin to embrace possibilities and this view of himself as being a better man; a man that deep down I think he always wanted to be.<br /><br />I found Abby's point of view whiny, mostly irrational given her very own behavior (with the exception of one part), and nothing that made me feel all that bad for her. I think she said one thing, did another and failed to execute things in a manner that would have reflected the life she laid out for herself and for others to see. Her past shows up and she chooses to embrace it, but yet feels unhappy and shocked at Travis's desire to make sure she never has to do that again. while she may have had a valid reason for such a reaction, she went about convey it the wrong way and brought so much hurt on everyone, including herself.<br /><br />I immediately went into Travis's point of view with Walking Disaster, and found the irony that he was more rational, balanced and sure of what he wanted even in his fear and uncertainty in general refreshing, especially given how new he was to love and relationships.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Its James bond, and this movie was just intense and had a lot of pump and power that Bond movies use to have back in the day with a healthy amount of intrigue and a wonderful boss character.
B004M9ZI0M|4.0|If I were watching this play solely for the entertainment values, I would love it. I bought it, however, to use with high school classes. The problem arises when the kids read the play and then have to wrap their minds around the significant differences resulting from substituting a female lead for the male lead that Shakespeare created originally. Helen Mirren is wonderful in the role, and I have loved her performances for some time. However, kids tend to struggle with the change. I spent some time reminding them of the essential relationships of parent and child, and that they need not be gender specific. While that may be helpful in daily living, it is somewhat confusing when a sixteen-year-old is trying to sort out those relationships in the context of Shakespeare's language and dramatic structure.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Excellent movie, we are waiting for the next one. We particularly liked the extra disc showing how it was made.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I appreciated the psychological aspect of this book.  The author describes a sociopath to a tee.  The manipulations were so great that you think how can someone be that thorough,  but that is what sociopaths do. I actually jotted down some lines from the book that were so &#34;right on&#34; when discussing relationship (man and wife) conflicts or concerns that can happen in marriage. Read this book in two days.

In A Tale for the Time Being, each locale and time period was depicted in a way that drew me in; a deftly written immersion experience. Character development, place description, plus that little bit of mystery-magic, made this read a too-quick but splendid journey for me. Highly rec.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm not quite sure why I love this series as much as I do.  I guess I get lost in the period and I can relate to the staff of Downton Abbey more than the elite class.  Their lives are as intriguing, complex, and authentic as it gets.  I have my favorite characters in both genres.  I love Maggie Smith's character because of her timely zinger statements  and Mr. Bates for his heartache.  It is a great story with rich characters.
B00BBRPRDG|1.0|....sorry to be negative, but it sounds like the \\"bunch\\" of songs on the album were all wrote in a day.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to type in my city and it tell me instantly if it will be raining when I get off or foggy in the morning on the way to work. It is nothing really special just a little handy app for instant knowledge.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Everyone Refrigerated about this book it was okay but the first first one was the best.  I only read all three because of cliffhanger endings then I read them and was disappointed. I will  not read anything else by this author if she writes more in the future.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Me and my six year old watched this movie 3 times with our rental and I am sure I will buy it soon enough. It is a great kids movie with no profanity and teaches them how rewarding it is to help someone else.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is really user friendly. It allows me to browse and pin things on Pinterest. It also allows me to pin things from the web. Love it! I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes it crashes and closes.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|It has great music in the back ground and is a fun little game of the shark trying to catch the fish. It does show the shark eating fish and maybe even ducks too so be aware of that part.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Over the course of the last few years, the science fiction genre of film has either provided major hits or complete misses.  Depending on who's acting and who's directing, movie-goes appear to be fairly picky about which sci-fi films they're willing to spend their money on.  In 2012, Prometheus took us back to the Aliens universe with critical and commercial success, while at the same time, Battleship and John Carter sank - ultimately drowning in a sea of misery.  Speaking of sci-fi success, Tom Cruise has been a part of a handful of lucrative sci-fi endeavors, including Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, and War of the Worlds.  Now, Tom Cruise is back once again with another pre-summer box office smash, Oblivion.<br /><br />Directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Lecacy), Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as Jack Harper, one of the few remaining survivors of the planet earth - half of which has been destroyed and deemed uninhabitable after a nuclear war with an alien species, known as Scavs (Scavengers).  Harper, along with his partner and love interest, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are in charge of an operation to salvage and extract the last of earth's natural resources, prior to leaving earth and rejoining their fellow humans on a massive space station, called Titan.  However, everything is not as it seems when Jack saves a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) from the wreckage of a crash-landing - the same woman whom he has been having recurring memories and dreams.  And, after making contact with the Scavs, Jack must uncover the secrets behind the organization for which he has been working and the reasoning behind his absent memory (which was mandatorily removed) .  Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />First and foremost, do not leave the theater when you see this film - and you absolutely should see this film.  Oblivion is one of the films that will require your attention at all times, because it's extremely easy to miss a giant piece of the puzzle during a bathroom break or popcorn run.  The film's plot is relatively easy to decipher by the conclusion of the film, however, there's more going on in this film that you can possibly interpret in one sitting.  The introduction of the film crams a whole lot of information into your head to set up the present conundrum being tackled by Cruise's character, Jack Harper.  Clearly, he's involved in a snatch-n-grab job, hastily attempting to remove earth's resources, while attempting to avoid any difficulties or interaction with the supposed villains, the Scavs.  However, it's impossible to get specific about the majority of the film's plot points without spoiling the film.<br /><br />Oblivion's cast is one of the most impressive features in this film and remains tremendously authentic from beginning to end in this enigmatic drama.  Tom Cruise hasn't been this enjoyable in quite a long time and really finds his groove with his character.  Reminiscent of the character from War of the Worlds, Jack Harper is mostly in the dark about the majority of the occurrences in this film and is often in over his head - yet somehow always manages to come out of each dire situation unscathed.  On the other hand, his partner (Victoria) constantly finds new ways to be jealous in a world where she has absolutely no competition.  At times, she can become an annoyance, but that's mostly due in large part to lack of her unwillingness to think outside the box (which is reserved solely for Tom Cruise's character).  Finally, let's face the fact here - everything is better with Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />By far and away, the most enjoyable moments of the film revolve around the CGI action sequences - which include some very intriguing and well-designed drones.  These drones are the main agitators in a rather Empire Strikes Back-like flight batter which is also a nice flashback to Tom Cruise sitting in a cockpit in Top Gun.  It's unclear whether or not the filmmakers meant to create a throwbacksci-fi Top Gun-style chase scene, but regardless, this specific flight chase will have you wishing for a Top Gun sequel (which was sadly cancelled after the death of its original director, Tony Scott).<br /><br />Overall, there's absolutely nothing in Oblivion that hasn't been done in some other sci-fi before it.  Sure, it would be easy to say this is just another post-apocalyptic film with alien invaders, ultimately forcing humanity to unite for a greater good to defeat them.  Yet, this film is much more complex than your average space-invaders film.  It provides a busier (occasionally confusing) than usual plot (in Prometheus fashion), so if you look away, you'll most likely miss something important.  But, if you play close enough attention to the plot points, you'll be able to tie everything together in a nice, pretty bow when the credits role - hopefully coming to the conclusion that Oblivion is a perfectly fun and enjoyable sci-fi film.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  A-<br />FNDNreview.comsci-fi Top Gun-style chase scene, but regardless, this specific flight chase will have you wishing for a Top Gun sequel (which was sadly cancelled after the death of its original director, Tony Scott).<br /><br />Overall, there's absolutely nothing in Oblivion that hasn't been done in some other sci-fi before it.

B005LHOKFS|5.0|I would never stay in a hotel without this little owl' s approval. We have went on more than ten vacations in two states and this app has never let us down. Four stars or better or we don't stay!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read and is definitely the best book John Green has written though don't be fooled it is incredibly sad and also it is beautifully written<br />John Green has always had a way with words having famous quotes from his books but this time it seems he has really outdone himself<br />I highly recommend the book and if you're anything like me you'll have it finished in a day or two
B00BWJARHO|2.0|&#34;The Hobbit&#34; is considered one of the great books; and this rendering is not up to that standard.  There is too much gratuitous violence and not enough character.  Those watching with me LOVED the book but the movie did not hold their attention.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Smaller than expected but a fun set to build. My 10 year old loves it. Hope Lego makes more minecraft sets in the future.
B000OVLIQU|5.0|It seems like every book about the Beatles is a &#34;must read&#34; but Geoff Emerick's book delves into each Beatle's personalities, their acumen in the studio and the band dynamics. His startling recall gives one the feeling that you were there in the studio. Great stuff.
B00957T6X6|5.0|My grandson talked us into watching the first season on DVD that he got for his mother. I bought the second season and couldn't wait for the third and following seasons so that is why I downloaded the books on my kindle. I am reading from the beginning of the series and there is a lot of information from the books that had to be eliminated from the DVDs so I am finding the books really help me understand the DVD's better.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This little guy goes everywhere with us. Even though my son has stopped taking a pacifier I still stick him in the car seat with him. In fact, he is in his bed right now. I think I might even remove the pacifier eventually and hand sew him back up. I highly recommend this product.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Not just a studio artist.The songs are just as fresh as recordings.Especially the last one:&#34;I Got a Women&#34;; with all the artists playing.His last gig.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|The movie was good, but the disc was scratched in a few places.  Was not able to view the movie entirely because it kept getting stuck in several places.  I was a bit disappointed that I had to restart the movie and move it past those sections, so I missed some parts of the movie.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Animation is almost lifelike! Lots of suspense and action!<br />even though it is animated it is still good for teenagers!!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This story holds an important lesson along the road to maturity, for all of us. I keep returning to Chris's story to help steer my own ambitions.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This movie is very close to the book, which I really like!<br />I am very glad that I bought it! It was totally worth the cost!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this app. Unlocking all the new games and playing games I would never have played without this app.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I am totally hooked on this band.  Great to see they included the cover that launched them to the top.  Can't wait for the next album.
B00005U122|5.0|I chose the rating because it is Pink Floyd.  What else is there to say.<br />I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys mature music.  Probably not for some bubble gum rockers.  But then, who knows?<br /><br />Jesse Simpson
B005IQZB14|5.0|I hiked the Colorado Trail several years back, and could identify completely with Cheryl Strayed's story. My backpack was also a &#34;monster.&#34;
B008Y7XNAK|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger movies are all good. Again, Amazon how about making all his movies available free to Prime Accounts? You may have a lot but all should be available.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Lots of fun to play. Great graphics. Kids really love this app.,adults will enjoy it just as much as kids
B0096BIENY|5.0|I love ILDivo & this cd is great.  They are true tenors & I could listen to them all day.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|Though six of the movies are packaged two movies on a disc, the quality of the film is not hindered.
B0040I09RM|5.0|this show is very interesting and i cant stop watching it. i am hooked. im  looking forward to more seasons.
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|I enjoyed reading the Lord of the Ring trilogy and The Hobbit. That being said as much as I enjoyed The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey I was truly disappointed that the Hobbit, the shortest of the collection, is now a trilogy . The producers of the Lord of the Ring trilogy were able to condense each of these books into ONE DVD each I'm sure they could have done the same for the Hobbit.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|There is so much that can be done with this app!! I cannot express all that can be done in words because it's too much typing involved. But I definitely would recommend it!
B0086HGW42|4.0|I am torn between the acoustic ballads and more poppy songs on this album.  Overall, I like it.  There's enough on this to make me a fan.
1455523550|4.0|This book was a good find. Very well written and imaginative. I was drawn into the story almost immediately, and came to feel as though I was right beside it's characters. The ending left a little to be desired, it could've stretched a little further. But all in all, I loved it!
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|This movie was disturbing - so much alcohol and drugs.  Love the actors in the film that is why I purchased it but it really made me anxious to know how the unions cover up for pilots who drink and use drugs. Too upsetting will never watch again.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|This series is very well made but not quite as suttle as the old series. The amazing thing are the colors in the house they have added.<br />Some of the story is far fetched and inaccurate. Rippendrop was not in England for such a long time. And I don't know if it is correct that there were English Nazis. The stories need more research.  But I suppose nobody would know the difference.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this free app it is fun and once u beat one level that u r good at u can get more and more points.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|A different take on some of the classics.  Cool, classy, easy jazz type mood music.  Easy listening.  Replaying it a couple times to start is almost a given, it's that good. A good way to sit back and relax in the bat cave after a taxing day of rounding up bad guys.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Not much to it as a free app and I don't want to get the purchased item since my grandsons already have it on their tablets.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Dr. Newton has given us a glimpse of our eternal lives from death to birth, through the use of regressive hypnosis. As I read this book, I also had thoughts about what the Bible has said concerning this. I know that David mentions in the Psalms that before he was born, all the days of his life were written in the book of life, before had lived one day. God already knows how long we're to live. When I look at the stars and contemplate the design that God used when He created the heavens, how can I, as a Christian, believe that our lives would be just happen stance? I believe that God had a plan for us, prior to our birth. This book may not be the only answer to these questions, but it does open our minds to the possibilities that all that we think we know, may not be complete and there is room for growth spiritually.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I lived in the UK for several years and read the Mail when I was there. I like to see a different view on the news. Also I am a big Manchester United soccer fan and they cover he soccer scene very well.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|A GREAT read! And more so if you have ever been to Ireland.,great author, you see exactly how he describes!
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|I downloaded Save Rock N Roll the day it was released, and I have reserved judgement until today. I listened to all of Fall Out Boy's albums on shuffle. What did I learn from this experiment? Well they sound strikingly similar to their older albums, full of catchy and surprisingly meaningful lyrics underneath all of the sugary pop. If you like Fall Out Boy and are on the fence, buy the album and you won't regret it. However if you disdain Fall Out Boy's previous albums, this will probably not sway your opinion. I love The Phoenix, The Mighty Fall...but HATE Rat A Tat. It would be a good song if they left Courtney Love out of it, but when I hear her say \\"It's Courtney bitch\\", I want to vomit.
B005K17RU0|5.0|a fast way to check weather for traveling or making outdoor plans. gives severe weather updates too. its very accurate. I don't make travel plans without consulting it.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Concerning that the Kindle Fire (Gen1) can get really really slow sometimes, this product works exactly as it should. It kills apps that are not needed, and if you do &#34;kill all&#34; it the kindle will reload all necessary system files and basically do a soft reboot. You can ignore any files that you don't want to close (like antivirus, which is unlikely that you would get one, especially if you don't load apps that are not from the app store, but I would rather be safe than sorry.) and be good to go. I see no reason to pay for the full version of the app, as the ads are not intrusive.<br /><br />So in summation, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, and for free you can't go wrong
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I went into this movie not knowing what to expect and came out with a very enjoyable experience. It was very appropriate for all ages and funny for adults and kids. The way the movie tied in with some old classic arcade games made me feel at home.
B000FC130E|4.0|Once again, Neil Gaiman shows the reader that there is far more to legends and names than meets the eye.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|As the title says, the movie was fantastic, riveting, tear-jerking, and more. My only complaint at all is not about the movie but about Amazon's rental service. Two times, naturally during high climax points, the movie paused and we had to wait for it to reload. That was disappointing.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|Loved loved loved it!! Tatum and Matthew make the movie!! Such hot abs and smack able butts!! Dancing is amazing the music is hot too!!
B008L40Q7E|4.0|I enjoyed reading Dr. No, Fleming's narration is taut and moves quickly. While Bond is a bit of a rake, his heroic nature overcomes his flaws. An excellent read for action fans.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|When I finally realized I could connect to my computer and recharge my kindle, I was impressed. I thought I would have to buy another cord, I ordered it and then found it was also a usb cable.  I was tickled.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First I loved the way she organized the book, every chapter the characters alternate.  Then there were many twist and turns.  You have no idea how the book is going to end.  For me it ended and you want more of the story.  I hope there is a gone girl 2.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think the game will be amanzing because it look good in all of the people keep telling me to download this game and get th
B001NHNG64|5.0|How does Lee Child do it? Extreme tension, fear and surprise. Amazing read that had me completely memorized. You won't be disappointed and if you are you have no emotions.
B001IFZL50|5.0|One of my favorite mini-series of all time. As a Marine it is refreshing to see a show actually depict the stresses of military business protrayed in it's most realistic adaptation.
B000031WD9|3.0|American Pie(1999) was a surprise hit in 1999. Some \\"religious people\\" tried to keep me from seeing it in a movie theater in my area..at the time. It spawned sequels and a bunch of semi-sequels for the direct to DVD market. It turned Seann William Scott into a movie star and The Stifler into an icon. Four teenage guys try to lose their virginity on prom night. This is a \\"sexy comedy\\" and it's packed with vulgar gags such as someone drinking beer with \\"filth\\" in it and a guy having sex with an apple pie! The film portrays its female characters as interesting. The film has a nice mix of mainstream popular music. The Ventures' Walk Don't Run is used during some toilet humor. This film earned its R rating from the MPAA. American Pie is not as raunchy as Porky's(1981). One of the film's trailers was a spoof of Eyes Wide Shut(1999). American Pie(1999) is a \\"classic\\" sexy comedy.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This was a great gift for my roommate who loves this series and got me watching it. Love the clarity and the sound quality.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I 'read' the audio version whilst on holidays a great book for those looking to revolutionise their business; a great read
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|Just finished watching this and was very disappointed. The Hobbit was a major book for me as a kid and seeing it treated as though it wasn't good enough for a movie was pretty tough. Within the first few seconds, the movie frames itself as a narration by Future Bilbo, thus notifying the viewer that Bilbo is never in any danger at any point in the story.<br /><br />A great deal of effort is spent alluding to the LOTR trilogy of movies in an obvious, distracting way. While I was not happy to see this self-serving behavior, it was at least understandable - they want to sell DVDs. What was more confusing were numerous sequences of events from the past, illustrating or sometimes just replacing a character who is telling a story. Invariably, these past events are far more exciting, and hint at a much more interesting Middle Earth, than anything depicted in the current timeline of the movie. The end result was as if this movie was spliced together with clips from a much better movie which will never be made.<br /><br />Huge sweeping liberties are taken with various characters, Radagast the Brown being a notable example. Can't wait to see what Beorn is like in the second movie!<br /><br />During the scenes that the movie condescends to share with the actual book, perplexing changes are made to character dialogue, in ways which don't help to tell the story but rather serve only to dilute the language. This is not a trivial criticism; Tolkien was a scholar of languages and used language in dialogue in a very specific way to help describe the personality of his characters. To alter the diction of, e.g. the riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum, is to fundamentally change the story of what happened between those two characters in that cave. Bilbo is changed from quivering with fear to confident and a bit testy. And this is a scene which, in relative terms, came pretty much straight from the text.<br /><br />More difficult to judge are scenes which never happened anywhere in print, including in the later-released material from Tolkien's notes discussing the background for the story. Much of this material is simply filler, giving the very clear impression that the filmmakers have nine hours to tell this story and intend to use every second of it whether they need to or not.<br /><br />I paid $1.50 to borrow this Blu-Ray from RedBox and I think that was about the right price for the experience. It's a very pretty movie with swords and monsters and lots of action, so there is entertainment value, but it's not really The Hobbit.<br /><br />It's The Hobbit as told from memory by a hyperactive six-year-old.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|I didn,t like the premise of future civilizations which the movie was built on.<br />In general the movie bordered on boring.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I saw the first few episodes on the internet.  It was intriguing and captivating so I borrowed at the library.  Watched a few more episodes and decided that I wanted to own the DVD series.  I usually don't buy the DVD series but this was good. The other DVD series that I thought was good which I bought was Firefly.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It's easy to use and super fast, other dictionaries really just don't meet the needs. I'll never need a different dictionary again.
B00746O3X8|4.0|I bought this to use when I go hiking on the weekend.  I have not been disappointed.  The only issue I have is the camera attachment which runs slack after an hour or so.  Despite that hiccup, I would recommend this product.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I wish that there were more games like this one. It is so addictive. I can play it for hours.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for the next season!!!!  I love all the new characters this season....  very interesting!!!  Great character development!!  Can't wait to see where they go next !!!!
B001CDD84Y|5.0|This movie is amazing! You'll be glad to JUST WATCH IT! TRUST ME-YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!! I've watched this TWICE with my husband and AGAIN with my 11 year-old son. LOVED. IT. SO DID THEY!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the character development in this series!!!!  Great cast !!!  It is so interesting.  Fun to be transported back in time!!
B004H6G0TI|3.0|My son LOVES this game but it keeps locking up. Five stars if it can be fixed!!<br />He is really getting upset and frustrated.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I received this DVD in a gift basket I won from a local TV station.  It took a while to watch it because I honestly didn't think it would be that good.  Was I wrong?  Oh, yeah!<br /><br />My son (14 years old) was even more reluctant to watch than I was.  \\"Fairy tales?  Really, Mom?\\".  And he barely glanced at the first couple of episodes.  But as time went by, he became as fully immersed as I.<br /><br />This is an incredible show.  The only actor I initially recognized was Robert Carlyle and since he has never failed to deliver, I had hope.  He didn't disappoint and neither did the rest of the cast.  You can't help but love some and hate some and regardless you are going to love the whole show.  It is not at all predictable and you never know which way they're going to jump.<br /><br />When it ended I thought that would be it.  What can they do now?  Well, I don't really know, but I can't wait for season 2 to come out so I can find out.<br /><br />I doubt you'll be disappointed in this.  We sure weren't.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This is one of the best. games I have played. It's fun and relaxing. It keeps you busy without aggravation ! Keep up the good work G5!
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is a very raunchy comedy.  Couldn't stop laughing with all the stuff coming out of a cuddly bear.  Ted is like a Peter Griffin.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book thoughtfully and pain to my heart. As a mother of a five year old boy, I found some of it hard to take.  I hold my son a little tighter now.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|THIS IS THEIR BEST ALBUM EVER!!!!  They definitely put out all the stops, and sounds like an original rock record since it was recorded in his garage.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This had been a great game for me &amp; my brother. we play for hours. Love all the prides that fall down on the board.
B001V5XV0E|4.0|This film builds an extraordinary amount of suspense, and proves the axiom that what you imagine to be happening is scarier than what you actually see onscreen.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob by William Landay<br />I thought this book was a great read. It leaves the reader, especially a mother,  with a lot to think about...
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awesome to play on the kindle fire great graphics and sound effects easier than using a mouse like on a computer. Just wish lives filled up faster. Lives being able to link with Facebook!
B0058HDT2G|5.0|Selena Gomez's  3rd  album. The  songs  are really  really  good. Selena's  best  album, so far. I  recommened you buy this  CD if you are a fan. Really  really  love  it.  :-)
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Saw this at the movies 2 times. It may not be a masterpiece like \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but it deserves its just dues. Great acting. Good plot. A real good time.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|My daughter in law suggested I watch Game of Thrones and I am so glad she did!  I bought Season 1 and became a captive audience of the story line and charactors. I believe the production was so good they didn't need the gratuitous sex scenes but that didn't harm the plot nor the good acting.<br />Much better than I anticipated.. Will buy Season 2.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|Although it was nothing I expected I love the fantasy . Beautiful photography and dreamy quality. Fantastic feats that leave me wondering....&#34;How do they do that?&#34;
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Says my daughters:<br />\\"I love it.  Next week can we watch this one again?\\"<br />\\"Baby tooth was my favorite character.  I don't know what I liked about it, but I really liked it.\\"
B0089PJFFY|5.0|This is an amazing book to read,  I'm still in awe over it. She puts you in that time period..... It is definitely a must read. I received it quickly, too.
1594200823|5.0|This book is more in interesting than  &#34;In Defense of Food&#34; and therefore better suited to book club discussion. I am very happy that the condition of the used book was fine and it arrived from the seller very quickly.  I belong to a book club and I buy used books whenever possible so that I can loan them to other members of the group. Another advantage of used books is if the book isn't a &#34;keeper&#34; I haven't wasted  much money.
B004NIFK9Q|4.0|Knowing that this took place in victorian times, I expected something more like Jane Austen.  The style of writing is not like hers.  Not sure when it was written, but the narrator has a sort of a strange tone of voice.  I saw part of the movie on tv and can't place that within the book... possibly I haven't gotten to that part yet.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I gave this to a friend and was accepted with much joy and elation.  Well made, great colors.  If you like Hello Kitty you should have at least one of these.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I pooped my trousers when i turned around and he started wacking the air and it said game over.<br />Truly a fun game on Hard. NIGHT mode.
0375836675|5.0|This is a great book, tweens will love it, adults will love it, everyone should love this book. Writing style is easy to read and the pages will fly by.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It's more like Glee Goes To College. But the music and actors are simply great. We loved it :-). Great for the family too.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is one of the best entertaining games period.I have played for countless hours it is well worth the money.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is very entertaining and, in my opinion, way better than Temple Run. The only problem is that the app always crashes on the Kindle Fire, so I haven't been able to play it on that certain device yet.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed it with the family. Our first Amazon streaming purchase. We're not set up for it on our TV so we watched around my computer. Amazon needs a little work to make accessing programing a little easier. Just purchased a new router from Amazon and am deciding on a Roku 3. Hope to ditch Dish in the next month and will go with Netflix or Amazon. Not sure which has the better selection.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game that is easy to play. Plenty of coins and even if no bingo you still win coins,gifts and power ups
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I'm not very far into the game but so far I like the new additions of now feeding two of those little guys. If you like the first two, you'll probably like this one as well - similar but still a little bit something different.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Its a great movie with amazing blu-ray quality. I had no problems at all, everything was there and intact! This is truly a great price for a quality movie!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Read with an open mind, this book has a lot to offer to a broad swath of readers. It is especially pertinent for young women considering their career and life choices. The best advice that sticks with me is, don't leave before you leave (if you are going on maternity leave for example); lean in to your work. On a sobering note, Sandberg cites evidence of the discrimination women face in the workplace, the barriers erected both external and internal. About those  barriers, this is not about finding fault. It is about taking responsibility and changing what you can change, women and men, advantaged and not. It is also about respecting choices, no more mommy wars.
B000MZHW1S|1.0|The format of this disc can only be played on select Toshiba devices so if you are using anything else this is worthless!
0446580848|3.0|First half of book is wasted by bla..bla !  Demille usually 'grabs' from first pages and develops Bad-Guy very quickly.  This Novel misses the point of tying in Cole attack.  This is especially true with recent tragedy which ties back to &#34;We hate America&#34;  Cole tragedy as direct attack on America, and US reluctance to recognize the severity, and intent to draw International attention of their violent potential.  Disappointed that I can lay book down without a second thought.  Forgettable read so far.  Perhaps last 1/3 will be more relevant.  If so, will be happy to 'eat my words'...
B00168OIOE|5.0|I had no problems with the product, everything was there and intact and it turns out this comes with a digital copy for iTunes or Windows Media Player. I hate dealing with ultraviolet so I was thrilled!
B0002TT0NM|5.0|An outstanding rendition of the book.  My 'next generation' of students to listen to the book and then see the movie loved it!  It didn't disappoint any of us!
B0085TKAW6|2.0|I was so looking forward to the next instalment of this sweeping story, and was massively disappointed - it reads like a historical Mills and Boone, the characters are no longer interesting, the plot-lines increasingly contrived and unlikely.  I gave up after less than a third.  Ken, you can do so much better!
1451695195|5.0|THE ENTIRE IDEA IS THOUGHT PROVOKING AND IT IS PRESENTED IN A PSEUDO SCIENTIFIC WAY WHICH LAY PEOPLE CAN APPRECIATE BUT WHICH PROFESSIONALS CAN ACCEPT AS REALITY.  VERY WELL WRITTEN AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL MAY CHILDREN AND MANY OTHERS
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|A totally engrossing and captivating book that manages to compress so much knowledge and details into an immensely accomplished story.  The heroes, the villains and the utter folly of war told with passion and respect, yet managing to convey it in a way that also presents the big picture.  Lest we forget, Beevor is the ultimate war historian.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Listen to this cd everyday...great songs, I love it! The songs are fun and just put you in such a good mood. Can't help but dance around whenever I listen to one.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Not quite as good as the previous books in the series, some things are a bit laboured and contrived, but it remains a good yarn and the cliff hanger at the end keeps me yearning for the next instalment still.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I bought this CD Pre-order, and it was worth it! While it is definitely different from the other Evanescence albums, its still good. You can hear the growth of the band, and the changes in attitude they have adopted along the way.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Shares the behind the scenes part of Major League Baseball.  Very well written and shares details of the back offices.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It met all my expectations.The music is great and beautiful.  The actors did a fantastic job especially doing their own singing.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As usual, Ken Follett, peaks your interest with strong characters (especially women) and paints both sides of the story - good and evil. This book was loaded with political and historical events that will be of interest to any enthusiast of international affairs of war.<br /><br />His writing style keeps you reading and wanting more. Not my favorite book of his but my husband will love it. He is a history buff! I intend to read the entire trilogy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A nice change from American network shows...I recommend watching.  They say I need 11 more words to submit this review but  I don't have them.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Wrote a review for book two which I am now reading,  Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors ever since I read Pillars of The Earth. He writes for both male and female readers. As for me, his strong women, are one of my favorite things about his novels. This book was a little overwhelming for me with all of the historical and political references but it kept me going and my husband, the history buff, is going to love it.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|Good acting but the story line was poorly develped---so much so that now I can't even remember (nor care) how it ended Maybe that was also due to the fact that the charactors were so unsympathetic. I disliked them all!
B008JEJPSC|5.0|This movie is the original and well worth watching again and having in your collection. Can't beat the cast of characters.
B009GX6600|5.0|Great show to watch! The characters are not boring and mesh real well.  Diva is very attractive, and even my kids enjoy the show!
B00CDT41RY|2.0|this movie is watchable, but much too long...pacing problems had me falling asleep in parts....acting is good, but most of the classic tarantino dialogue is conspicuously absent in this film....probably one of his worst efforts
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I love his new CD.  In fact I have all of his music in CD form. I will buy  another one when he records another CD.
B000RD0RDU|5.0|I originally wanted to get an internal raid enclosure, but these products had bad reviews. So I chose to replace my aging fans in the mobile racks. Drives instantly got colder by 10 degrees celsius after replacement.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|If you are an amateur or intermediate photografer, this book will show you the right tips to improve your photos without usign Lightroom to fix your underexposed or overexposed pictures.
1603427244|1.0|The whole reason I purchased this book was 4 instructions on doing Cast-ons & Bind-offs. Well, it gives pictures of How-To BUT almost 1/2 of the How-Tos are split, meaning here you are in the middle of a complex Cast-on or Bind-off and you have 2 turn the page in order to continue.  Most of the time you're using both hands, so to have to turn the page in the middle of learning a new & difficult task is completely disorienting & extremely frustrating. It would have been so much better if the author had just either enlarged the book OR made sure all the instructions could be viewed at the same time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I loved minecraft!!! But I do wish they would put in mind shafts and rail road tracks with mine carts!??? ( that could be in the next update). Don't get me Wrong  i love this game , but  for a cheaper price!!! ($$$$$$)
B005ES12S2|5.0|These shoes are wide - I have wide feet so the shoe is an excellent fit for me - to the &#34;T&#34;<br />I ordered my normal size. Giving credit to Penny V. for this purchase based on her review.<br />Comfortable thick soles nice look - I've had several pairs of Croc's thus far I like these the best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I hope they do a good job with the movie.  Because I loved the first movie and then decided to read the series and just like any other  book to movie out there it just can't come close.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|read this as a kid.. downloaded it to my kindle fire to read to my daughter...Still a good one! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game!!!!!!!! I just love how this kid and his buddies are messing up Sydney's trains. For doing that, they get chased by this fat police guy. It's hysterical and original!!! ;)
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Incredible personal account of the genius of Lincoln.  Personal view of the Civil War.  Certainly a view of the war from an original angle. A &#34;to-be&#34; classic.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved the details, colors, and how I was able to see how war affected Germany. Loved the foreshadowing and the narrator. Could not put the book down. Great book!!
B003CIG7AE|5.0|This is the first album from this talented group that I've ever bought/heard.  Many great songs, from &#34;Laredo&#34; to the somewhat haunting &#34;On My Way&#34;.  I also really loved &#34;Older&#34; and &#34;For Annabelle&#34;.  All in all a really good buy.  I highly recommend this one.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Great quality. Not my type of show, but if my wife loves it, then I am happy. It looks clear, works as advertised.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the content on this CD.  I'd been hearing buzz about Gary Clark Jr. from local Austin radio stations, and bought this one on a whim.  What a great album!  I can hear traces of so many greats, from (the obvious) Jimi Hendrix, but I also hear the influence of Marvin Gaye, Robin Trower and John Mayall.  This is a really talented musical legend in the making.  Look forward to more from Clark in the future.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|The product was as described. No surprises! Works as well as the name brand at an excellent price. I'm satisfied.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started viewing Downton Abby and became an avid fan instantly.  I had to view every available episode and cannot wait for next season!
0525421580|5.0|Really excellent book. I love it! John and David are the perfect combination. Everybody sholud read it. Great book! =D
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|this is a great start to the next trilogy by peter jackson.  i can't wait until part 2 to come out.
0515153656|2.0|Just never grabbed me. Don't get why it would appeal. I have read hundreds of mystery and thrillers and this one leaves me cold. The main character is so simplistic and ultimately such a cardboard cutout. Plotline all over with no rhyme or reason.
B0006GAO3G|5.0|Again a fine set of actors have rounded out the story line and presented a great work of art on the screen! What else can be said of this beautiful story and might just represent real-life at its funniest!
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Unbelievably gripping story. Loved it from beginning to end. Beautiful scenery, awesome acting. Literally kept me awake on the edge of my bed, panting I was so nervous. This is a movie about an extraordinary feat with a bit of a love story tied in. Watch it, even if you disagree with some of the decisions made by the film makers to introduce some extra drama there is no way you can be disappointed by this movie.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Icant wait for the sequel I hope there is a part two.Great movie for a friday nite at home alone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Perfect for my kindle. What else can I ask for. I hate the ads but don't wanna pay any extra fee!
B00BG08FKK|4.0|I absolutely adore this CD. The songs are great: only a few things are edited out. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I can't listen to the song &#34;One Day More&#34;. There are weird noises playing throughout it, almost like what happens when the CD is scratched.... and it's brand new. I was disappointed in that because &#34;One Day More&#34; is one of my favorite songs and now I can't listen to it. I'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem or not. Other than that, I've really enjoyed this product. If you loved the movie or you just love Les Miserables, you'll love this CD.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I highly suggest it!  It's a good book to reference every once in awhile.  I have recommended it to numerous people.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great book! Can't wait to read the sequels. Starts off a little slow but is worth it. Definitely would recommend.
B000FA675C|5.0|I enjoyed the fast pace and the well described foreign locales. The book is also very well researched. I would recommend!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I read it cause it's part of the set. It's really good but it's more political than action oriented like the first book.
B007FC3AAI|4.0|I have all the Twilight movies.  These movies are not great drama but great fun to watch.  I have the entire collection.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Thought they already thought of everything to do in Cut the Rope! Guess I was wrong! With new elements including mines, shurikens, and Time Freeze buttons, there is more than enough candy to feed Om Nom and his relatives!
1400052173|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was well worth the read. It was informative, thoughtful & thought provoking. Where would we be medically if not for these cells of Henrietta? I will recommend this book to everyone who has & hasn't had any science background. Thank you Rebecca Skloot for your years of research to bring Henrietta & her contribution to the health & well being of mankind.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK, IT TOOK A DIFFERENT TURN THAN I WAS EXPECTING BUT IT WAS A VERY GOOD AND INTERESTING TURN. I BELIEVE IF YOU READ THE FIRST BOOK YOU WILL WANT TO READ THIS ONE ALSO, IT IS A PAGE TURNER.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|Growing up on what we now call 'classic rock' I had moved on musically to other genres in my 20's, but have found myself collecting some of these great old albums on CD of late.<br /><br />This one stands out in my mind as being better remastered than many.  Not heavily compressed or too bright it balances modern mastering techniques with great rock & roll sound recorded almost 30-years ago.<br /><br />It's a great trip down memory lane as I much prefer this soundtrack from the movie, which I saw dozens of times as a teen at midnight showings.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK, DID NOT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. IT WAS A GREAT READ.<br />I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS READING.
B004NELBPC|3.0|Not unlike the iOS version for iPad I find the Huff Post app to be ok.  It seems, at least in my experience, to be more buggy/laggy than the iOS version for iPhone.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|great overall play.  graphics and ease of use are good.  I would recommend this game to my friends.  good job on the game.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|I have this series on DVD as well and seeing it on BD is such a treat.  The quality is most excellent and really makes it such an enjoyable experience watching on our larger television.<br /><br />As for the content itself this is a superb series.  While enjoying political, dark and dry humor helps, this series is so well done in every aspect that it's enjoyable period.
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|This blue ray movie is the best in color reference for your HDTVm. I love the quality of this film.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Ithink he gets to the heart of a character and wrings them dry.  You know exactly who they are,  Always has a great story line.
B00003CXBH|4.0|The scenery dominates this movie, especially when you see the waterfall.  It tells a great story, and there is much to recommend learning more about the native tribes of South America in colonial times.  The biggest problem that I have is trying to get the characters' names, as they are rarely called by their names.  As a result, I had to watch it a second time because I didn't understand who was Spanish, who was Portuguese or who was in charge and who was subordinate.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Had no problems adapting to the app vs website. Works smoothly and graphics are comfortable to view. I rate this an a+.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This was one of the best reads I'd had a in a long time. The author leads you down many \\"garden paths.\\" Most authors would put on paths that lead to no where. All her paths go somewhere and never where you thought you going. I read this several years ago, when it first came out. I remember never being sure if I was reading a murder mystery or a ghost story or both. I found this story to be refreshingly different and unexpected and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Initially, I got this App' at a siblings recommendation. Since then, the (app') product has continued to iprove. This is the app' to use!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|tried over and over but this update will not install.  Sprint Samsung galaxy s 3.<br />please fix this update. pretty please
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Acting is wonderful and the story is so addicting.  I have not finished the 2nd Season yet, but I am sure it won't dissapoint.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|It is a little sad because of the situation but the characters are very likeable and it's easy to care about what happens to them. It is also a good topic for discussion if you are in a book group.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|This film could be viewed as a friendly little reminder of the overwhelming influence of the nonverbal. I'm thinking of all those cliques that we've heard thousands of times: It's about what we do and not what we say, familiarity breeds contempt, silence is golden, it's not what you say it's how you say it, it's all about listening, attitude is everything, and on and on.<br /><br />Up until I saw this film, I thought I had all of that under my skin. Not so. I guess I had to have someone or something show it to me. Literally show it to me. This film did just that. I hope that I will work harder on understanding the nonverbal from this point forward in my own life. (Please note that I'm not referring to this as nonverbal \\"communication.\\" This is deliberate. Communication implies forethought. This film did a very good job of demonstrating that much of what goes on between people nonverbally is not deliberate.)<br /><br />I read a couple of reviews in the newspapers before I saw this film.  It was supposed to be a \\"subtle\\" and \\"elusive\\" film, according to the reviews.  But as I was watching this film I thought, \\"This?? subtle? elusive? They have to be kidding.\\"  By the end of the film, I could have sworn I had been watching an Oliver Stone film (I mean this in a good way; I like Oliver Stone films).  I felt that I had been pounded over the head again and again with what the film was saying.<br /><br />And that's O.K. This film is a very fine piece of \\"wake-up\\" theater. And I will work hard on getting this stuff under my skin. It will make me happier, more aware, more attuned to people. (I couldn't help thinking that, as I watched this film, I typically have very little trouble whatsoever noticing and appreciating and tuning into nature sorroundings, i.e., the non-human nonverbal, if you will. In real life, and in all the films that I have seen prior to this film, what goes on verbally with humans usually diverts my attention away from what is going on with them nonverbally, which is unfortunate, because, as this film has taught me [or maybe just reminded me in a very direct manner], it is the nonverbal that leads us to the wonder.)lly, which is unfortunate, because, as this film has taught me [or maybe just reminded me in a very direct manner], it is the nonverbal that leads us to the wonder.)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was home sick and able to watch season 1 and 2. Then I found out season 3 was available on Amazon! Imagine my excitement so I purchased the season and watched with glee.
B0086449YA|5.0|Not a bad song on either disc. Great double album. I am a Knopfler fan since Dire Straits days and he never disappoints. Moves through several genres, pop, blues, folk, jazz and all works well. Great guitar work as always of course but much more than that.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Another good movie from Disney/Pixar.  Another great character for girls to look up too.  Great story with as usual visual experience.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Good album which would have probably been better had I not listened to the two Mumford & Sons albums. This one is very similar in style. Not that there is anything wrong with that of course. They know what they are about and the harmonies are seamless just like the Mumfs. Good album.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Once again Disney/Pixar has made a great movie.  Great movie for the family.  A must see.  Great concept with video game characters.  You will watch movie over and over as my family did and still do.
B00AFOS6P2|4.0|Dark and moody as usual. Great craftsmanship and songwriting. Nothing dramatically new here but a good listen nonetheless. Enjoyed it.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Decent movie but it gets lost for a bit.  Great visual effects with some good actors.  Was expecting a little more.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Its super duper awesome. But the hunger games was better. The great Gatsby is my fave still! Jk im just a kid
B0060MYM7O|5.0|One of the best series on TV.  Second season was great and development of characters.  Can't wait for Season 3.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is one of the best games on the market. The only problem is that it takes 2 minutes to get energy, but even that is very fast compared to other games I highly recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />-PENGUIN
B00947N6UG|5.0|Fun movie for the kids although a it may be a little scary for 3-5 year olds.  Overall fun movie for all.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I liked this movie. It is very well done and the 3D made it better. Tiger, Hyena, monkey, zebra and whale. (There's your 5 words)
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Great movie for the kids and adults as well.  Fun for all.  If your kids like Halloween then they will enjoy this movie with all your favorite type characters.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I like this version of the Hobbit, so far. I dont like that they dont tell you it's a 3 part movie. Had I known that I would have waited for all 3 installments and bought the compilation.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best series on TV.  A must see for Zombie or SCIFI fans.  The show has progressed great.  Developing characters and even killing off a few good ones.  Season 3 was one of the best.  Cant wait for Season 4
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This is definitely a movie for all ages and genders. We watched this movie with two little girls (4 and 7) who really had no prior knowlege of older video games, but that did not stop them from enjoying it. The graphics are great as is the story line. Disney movies are fantastic.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This book gives great insight into the world of the restaurant business.  Great story of how he came to be who he is today.  Must read for all who want to be in the biz. If your a fan of him this is also a must read.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I really like this game. It`s nice to play when you get bored.  I like it how you can create your own projects. You can use details like you can make purple zebras.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Great second Season for the Walking Dead.  Started out slow but second half of season was fantastic.  Great follow up to the first season which no one expected much.  A must see for all Zombie & SCIFI fans.
B004478AS4|5.0|A picture of an indigenous culture in Africa that treats the characters like real people, people I could identify with. The contrast between perceptions of the British colonizer and the people of the village is drawn with painful accuracy.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A journey into the foster care system in my local area was educating.  I really cared about the characters the author created and learned about flowers in the mean time.  I will never see flowers in the same ordinary way again.  Loved this story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather app is easy to use and gives a lot of helpful information. I like how easy it is to track the weather in several locations
B009VMN3RA|3.0|Sometimes I think Sachi exaggerates her stories, and embellishes them, but still I pity her for the neglectful childhood she had to endure.  Shame on her parents for caring so little about the little girl they brought into this world.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|No problem, lots of fun! Similar to candy crush everyone keeps telling me about but it works on my kindle. Give it a try.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app! It's easy to navigate and you can find anything your looking for! I highly recommend it.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I always enjoy her novels. This story was low keyed yet had enough movement to keep me interested and hungry for more.
1476719071|5.0|More of my reviews can be found on my blog @ [...]<br /><br />Over a long period of time I read a novel which did not have any supernatural elements. Refreshing! \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is written by an American writer Jamie McGuire and her style is refreshing and interesting. The story begins as America (somehow her name reminds me of someone excotic from Puerto Rico or some place like that, not just a blond gorgeous girl) takes her bff Abigail to a fight, where his boyfriend's (Shep) cousin, best friend and roommate Travis 'Mad Dog' Maddox is about to start his fight. Travis is famous for his fights (and he never loses, btw) and for his one night stands. Abby's a good girl. After the fight, when Travis sees Abby, their paths begin to cross. They become friends and soon they make a deal: if Abby wins, Travis will live a month in celibacy, if Travis wins, Abby will stay in his apartment for a month. It's not hard to guess, what happens next.<br /><br />BD is either a book to hate or love. I tend to do the last one. Not that it's my favorite read (lately). No, definitely not, but it's such and interesting and absorbing story. The author concentrates on telling the story of Abby and Travis (as well as Shep and America). It's not the easiest relationship. It's rather complicated. They're the total opposites of one another, but both have a complicated past.<br /><br />Abby is literally running from her past with America, trying to turn a new page, but with Travis, it all seems to come crushing down. She's honest with him and straightforward. Tells him everything she thinks. No one does that. Travis listens to her and likes her honesty. He's intrigued as Abby's not doing everything to get his attention and she's not melting on every word he says. She stands on her ground even if it hurts Travis. They become good friends, but due to different circumstanses they have to share a bed and they spend all their free time together. But Travis isn't the only one who's being hit on,there's a line behind Abby and it's not something Travis's happy excactly happy about. The question is: what can he do to win her over, because she seems to like him only as a friend and the shadows of her past haunt her when she's with him and she definitely does not want to be another trofey of his.<br /><br />I believe that a lot of the readers cannot stand their love-hate relationship, frown upon his impulsive nature and think that Abby should have walked away a long time ago. However, I think that no relationship is perfect and every person is one's own, excactly like every relationship is different. Travis gave up a lot of his vices to prove to Abby and himself that he can be the better person. Travis was not the only one guilty in the fights they had. I'm not a psychologist or a counselor and a lot of you are right, form different aspects they are complitely wrong for each other, but at the same time they're so right for each other.<br /><br />It was hard to put the book down, because at the end of every chapter there were awesome cliff hangers and there were some big moments in every chapter as well. I liked it. It was refreshing to read such an emotional story about life and not to get distracted by supernatural elements. Everything is not always so black and white as it seems. There are highs and lows in friendships. Also, in love. It's up to us to solve the problems and learn from them. After the dark clouds and deafening thunder there's usually a ray of sunshine lurking from behind a cloud and a rainbow usually isn't so far away either.<br /><br />Some side notes:<br />*The name Travis reminds me of Travis Pastrana<br />*The book describes the life in an American college and also the parties<br />*My favorite character probably was America, she's a great friend and the life of the party<br />*At times I thought Travis was bipolar, because his moodswings were quite horrifying , but he wasn't so all's good
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is Les Mis at its best...befoe Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway. The staging, &#34;set&#34; and costumes are simple. The voices, music and emotion is breathtaking. This version allows you to focus on the story of determination and love. Just a beautiful production.
0142419400|3.0|More of my reviews can be found on my blog @ [...]<br /><br />I'd heard so many great things about this book and there seemed to be a Stephanie Perkins fan everywhere I looked. Even 90% of my Goodreads' friends had given it 4-5 stars. So once I passed this book at a bookstore, I immediately took a few steps back and figured what the heck?! Everyone loves it, why can't I? I at least need to check out what the fuss is about, right?<br /><br />QUOTE<br />\\"The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.\\"<br /><br />It was a very sweet story. An example of exactly how sweet would probably be if one were to eat a bowl full of ice cream with chocolate syrup and honey poured all over it - that's how toothsome it was. The plot itself was quite cliché. I somewhat enjoyed it, but it wasn't that interesting, to be honest with you. The writing was good, story moved on quickly, but it felt like it didn't progress. That doesn't make any sense, does it? What I'm trying to say is that even though Anna's year abroad went by quickly and was easy to follow, there weren't that many, if at all, moments where I was supposed to be O__O. (God.. Even this review isn't progressing.)<br /><br />What I liked was that it was very current and from a cultural aspect I enjoyed it a lot. In addition to referencing to one of my favorite football players - Francesc Fàbregas - Perkins featured different authors, history, movies. Also, sightseeing was one key points of this book which made me eager to explore City of Love myself. I loved the graveyard picnic with Anna and her American friends. Oh, and the design of this book - uh-mazing! Love, love, love it! The deckled edges and everything, it's freaking adorable and even kind of edgy.<br /><br />However, even if I was satisfied with the storyline and writing, the characters fell flat for me. I just didn't connect to any of them and the one I liked the most was Anna's little brother Sean who most of the time wasn't even with her. I'm not sure what was missing, though.<br /><br />The one thing this book did achieve in is that I'm eager to visit the capital of love even more than ever before. I've travelled through half of the European countries and France, unfortunately, belongs to the bunch I haven't been to. So City of Light, I dare you to wait for me and be as kind and inspiring to me as you were to Anna.<br /><br />QUOTE<br />\\"Har. Bloody. Har.\\"<br />He smiles. \\"Oh, I see. Known me less than a day and teasing me about my accent. What's next? Care to discuss the state of my hair? My height? My trousers?\\"<br />Trousers. Honestly.<br /><br />I think that at the end of the day most of the readers love and adore this book while I just thought it was okay, hence the 2.5 stars. I'll still read Lola and the Boy Next Door though and hopefully I'll have better luck with that one.
B0074YVW1G|3.0|Classic example of a few good observations parlayed into a book. I happen to agree with many of the observations but became increasingly short of breath as the book morphed into a self help tome. Classic over reach of self appointed expertise  in a whole lot of unnecessary words.<br />Where is the editor?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Characters don't seemed to be fully explored and the ending was hurried.  It was much weaker than book one and left me wanting a better ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This really is easy on the eyes. I have a 7in Kindle, and the fonts and presentation is great. A calculator is always useful. I would definitely recommend.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game!! Super unique! Challenging, but not frustrating. Hope to see many more from this developer. Can't wait for the next one!!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I've never been a huge rap fan but Macklemore is a lyrical genius. The songs are smart, thought provoking, fun, and I can't wait to see him become mega famous.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy seeing pictures of people and children I don't see very often<br />I like the games<br />It is easy to follow
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Interesting study in the dynamics of a family and just how far parents will go for their kids.  Sometimes you think you know what's going on, but there's that nagging suspicion that things can change in an instant.  Enjoyed it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My son installed this on his tablet and been having a blast with it. His only complaint is that he can't move and drag something at the same time.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This one was a true page turner.  I ate the book up in about 1.5 days.  It was one of those I just couldn't put down.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Characters are rich and well acted. A typically great British series it deserved the attention it received at the awards ceremony.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is such a great book on so many levels. Hazel Grace, a teenager, is dying of cancer and falls in love with Augustus Waters, another teen also dying of cancer. As they fight cancer, they are grasping for their purpose in this world and the mark they will leave on it before they die. Although their perspective is through the eyes of young adults, it rings true for all if us. Green created such amazing characters that are intelligent, witty, and poignant. I loved this book for it's honesty and true depiction of life and death and the possible meaning of it all.
B005USZYDU|4.0|I wasn't sure I'd like this with a young boy as the main character.  It was really good and I've ordered the subsequent books in the series.
1579126278|5.0|If you like mysteries and you have never read &#34;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&#34; --- then you must have been locked up in a closet for most of your life.  This is one of the stories that made Agatha Christie famous.  I still remember when I read the ending and what a surprise it was! Granted, I was about 15-16 years old at the time, but I still couldn't believe &#34;who-did-it&#34;! I finally bought a copy so I wouldn't have to take it out of the library again (and again).
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I enjoy the plot behind this series. I love the characters especially Calinda and Carry. THe star crossed lovers Will and Alechia with always the question, will they ever be together or will she choose Peter???
0762434279|1.0|Did not recognize by the description that this book is about 3 inches square.  I checked the number of pages and it appeared like a normal size book.  Labeling it pocket size would have been appropriate.3 1/4 by 3 1/4 inch<br />It is not that I hate the book it is the only way to review...it actually caused me to laugh at how I did not 'catch' this!  Big dissapointment.  Conversation peice!
B00APAENUI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy reading about, associating with, and being delighted with the characters in Honor Harrington's World!  I've purchased all the - currently - released books, and am tracking those in the publication pipeline!  Great reading!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I were hooked on Downton Abbey just recently after watching Season 1, Episode 1 on Xfinity on Demand. Over the next few weeks, we then watched all of Season 1, and then all of Season 2 on Xfinity. The only place we could find Season 3 was on Amazon Instant Video. After some initial hesitation because of the price, we decided to begin watching Season 3 on Amazon. The technical quality (HD) is fine, and the show is terrific, but we wish the price were lower.

0062014536|3.0|Oh, friends. How to tell you about my thoughts on REQUIEM by Lauren Oliver. This is actually a hard review to write. Not because I can't think of things to say or because I don't have any feelings about it. OPPOSITE. I have thoughts and feelings about REQUIEM. I just wish that they were different. I WANTED them to be different. I enjoy Lauren Oliver`s books. Like lots of people, REQUIEM was a book that I both anticipated greatly and feared like whoa because I was afraid of what heart-wrenching things would be in store for Lena and Alex and Julian. So here it is, in a nutshell: ARGH WTF MEH. That would be my review of REQUIEM in a few words/expressions. I was disappointed. I don't think there's a worse way for a series to go out than this one did, and I mean that almost literally-my biggest issue here was the ending. WAAH!!<br /><br />So REQUIEM is basically two stories that come together at the end: Lena's journey with the Resistance, which now encompasses Alex and Julian; and her friend Hana, who returns to the main storyline as a cured young girl engaged to the new mayor of Portland. The Resistance is trying to fight against the government, who have infiltrated both the Wilds and the Resistance itself. Yup. We've got traitors, friends. Meanwhile, Lena is dealing with the close proximity and blatant coldness of Alex, and the growing feelings and warmth of Julian. Meanwhile, Hana is living in Portland. She's been cured and is engaged to the new mayor, who's kind of a dirtbag. Their stories converge at the end when the Resistance comes to Portland and then...well, I have no idea. Neither will you. ARGH!<br /><br />Here's my feelings about this whole series-because I feel like you have to judge the series as a whole, now that it's finished. DELIRIUM = hands down, the best of the three. No contest. One of my worst ugly cries ever. PANDEMONIUM = very good, but not as good as DELIRIUM. I missed Alex but eventually Julian grew on me. REQUIEM = worst of the three, and that makes me sad and a touch angry. I will most certainly back that up though, because I know that's a really strong thing to say. But truthfully, I couldn't be more honest about my feelings right now, and I've had more than a month to mull everything over. My initial feelings haven't changed.<br /><br />Before I get going on what bummed me out about REQUIEM by Lauren Oliver, let me just say that I actually flew through this book. I have been invested in Lena and Alex and Julian the whole time, and that didn't change here. I was captured by their daily lives with the Resistance, and the way there was no safe place for them. They lived in constant danger. People close to them die, and I was sad. People they trust betray them, and I was angry. Lauren Oliver, as always, knows how to play with our hearts, and she did a good job here. Alex is mostly a big jerk to Lena, and he kind of flirts with another girl for most of the book. But I totally felt that he had MORE FEELS than he was letting on. And Julian is likable as before, but I got a distinct impression that Lena was trying to force herself to feel for him what he feels for her, and Julian deserves better than that.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed getting to see Hana again, which was a surprise to me when I read REQUIEM. I love that Lauren Oliver puts us in the head and the life of a cured person. We see Hana's struggles with her lovelessness, and how she maybe still has something like feelings of love hidden within herself. By the time the end of REQUIEM comes along, I wasn't very sure WHY we got to see things from Hana's perspective-her story seems kind of superfluous-aside from the simple reason of getting a perspective of a cured person. Still, all in all, I enjoyed reading about her, and she plays a role in the end.<br /><br />Now. The end. UGH GUYS. I don't even know how to begin, so perhaps I should just begin with frankness: I yelled out loud when I read the last page. Because I was pissed and frustrated. I might have use swear words. I might have also said the words \\"cop out.\\" Perhaps my feelings have cooled slightly since, but this is still the most disappointing part of REQUIEM, and it colors my opinion of this whole book. There's no resolution to anything. I can't even tell you all of the things that are up in the air by the time the last paragraph comes around. Lauren Oliver, as usual, writes beautifully. But DANG LADY, we could've used a few more words! I know that ending things the way she does was partly intentional, but it felt...UGH. I didn't like it.<br /><br />I hope you guys don't take this as me being a person who can't appreciate an open ending. Not true. I have absolutely no problems with them, if they're done well. I didn't think this one was. Like, at all. This makes me so unbelievably sad. Because this series started with an INSANE amount of promise and feels and emotions! The ending of REQUIEM is almost the equivalent of a book ending with all the characters getting in a car accident and you have no idea who lives or dies or what happens at all. It's like the end of the Sopranos. EVERYONE here is literally in the middle of A THING, and then-nothing. It's beyond frustrating.<br /><br />You know what stinks the most about this, too? If I'm being honest when I make recommendations of this series, I'd have to say that it starts out AWESOME and ends with a huge, disappointing whimper. SUCH a bummer. UGH, friends. ALL THE UGHS.<br /><br />I do hope that you read REQUIEM by Lauren Oliver, friends, and I hope so much that you don't have the reaction to it that I did, because I enjoyed this series...until it ended. I remain a huge fan of Lauren Oliver for sure, though, and I'll be looking forward to what she's got coming next. But until then, I've got a meh taste in my mouth.ght have use swear words.

B005K17RU0|1.0|Used to love this app and it was easy to use, quick, good design. Kids would check to know how to dress for school. I wish I had read reviews before updating!  I would have kept the old version that was still working. I never dreamed I'd be &quot;updating&quot; to something so completely different!  I hope they'll bring back the old version. I wish the kindle apps told what the updates include like iphone updates do on the screen where you push the update button.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|the app is fun but my only complaint is that it should  make more levels more ooften other than that the game is awesome.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|this is a great app, now when you just can't remember that song that plays over and over in your head, now you can know the name and artist.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is easy to use and works well for my kindle. I've had no problems with it at all.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is great to write down things that you need to remember:  grocery lists, things you want to remember, etc
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate,  very easy to operate. If your looking for a great weather app that's free, get this app. This app hasn't let me down yet.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can only describe it as a Hellrasier Box/Cabinet. Not that anything is horrifying, but that it's so tricky, ingenious, dastardly....and you just keep OPENING new secret compartments to lead you to MORE secret compartments and keys and codes....it was great. And I do pride myself on not using 1 hint...It took a few hours to complete, was completely worth the 2 bucks. I can't wait until the next one!!!
B000SVZIDA|4.0|Whether she know it or not, Ms. Kidman upstaged herself by bringing Mr. Ewan Mcgregor.  What a voice!  Wonderful casting!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love all Angry Bird games, I go through bouts of playing it nonstop and then don't play it for weeks. Fun and challenging on some levels, I have no complaints.
B009AP2G26|4.0|The show is not as enjoyable since the graduates moved away.  I do not like the singing of the new group as much as the old group and Rachel became somewhat slutty in her new school.  The breakout into songs is a bit tripe.  Essentially the story has become more campy.  I still enjoy it because it is musical theater but my interest is waning.  I might not watch it next season.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have all the Angry Bird versions and I love all of them, my 7, 8 and 9 year old kids also like playing it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is still one of my favorite shows.  I wish there were more episodes in the season but it remains the same as previous seasons.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have not personally played this game myself, but my boys, who are 7 and 8 years old, love it.
B0083GR6Y6|4.0|Wilderness action adventure with Liam Neeson.  Always appreciate his mix of sophistication and brutality, in this man vs wild he gets to showcase this contrast.  A good plot that places you in the action like a slasher movie, you may find yourself second guessing the characters as they take actions to survive and miss-steps along the way. You won't doze off on the couch while watching The Grey!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Like all my other game apps, it is simple and fun and I have no complaints about it. My kids like it too.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Classic game of matching tiles. Like that you can play timed or not. Easy to understand, with a decent variety of layouts to challenge the player.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|As all my other Angry Bird games, I love this one as well. My kids enjoy playing it on my Kindle too.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is by far one of the best that I have purchased!  The multi tip design goes well between my Kindle Fire and my HTC phone.  All three of the tips work well, and have lasted much longer than any of the other Stylus's (Styli?) that I have used.<br />My only problem is that I have lost mine somewhere in my house!  I hope to find it soon.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|I loved The Parent Trap when it originally came out with Haley Mills.  This version was a good updated version.  To bad Lindsey couldn't handle her fame.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|I tried to download the mobile to my nexus 7. Though is it part of my kindle account, I kept getting a message about it not being compatable with my kindle fire. I own both. Think Ill try again soon though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best horse game out there, very addicting and very realistic! My kids love it and I do too! Graphics are fantastic as well!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci has a way of capturing my attention early on and keeping me intrigued throughout the book.  I love meeting one of his new main characters.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|Great for title and writing on pictures. I am new to this app but finding new app for my art is nice. Thank you
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I only ran through the first \\"easy\\" part of this game, but found it too dull to continue.  When I wanted to get out of the game I had trouble getting out of it, and that annoyed me.  It comes with commercials, and I don't like them either.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is a good pick for the price and the usability. You can use it with cell phone and applicable Kindle devices.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a good game for all ages.  The graphics are pretty, and the game is challenging enough to be fun.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Like this game. Keeps me company on trips and I enjoy beating my ex boyfriend score. Cool to play against friends
B00BEEC6L2|3.0|Okay so I have his faithful robo-servant Walter on the brain. This is where it begins. The showdown with his clone brother Rico, the Mega-City 5000, tales on the moon, and more. There's even a special surprise prog at the end of this book. Yes it's from 1977, and Drokk it, it shows, but you get to see the origins of the Judge. Now the art is dated and some things in the setting have changed, but it's good old fashioned Judge Dredd and is something no fan or anyone interested in the future's top lawman, should be without.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|This was outstanding in several ways. Although fiction it was something that could have happened. Situation, equipment<br />and life aboard a British sailing warship was informative. Even the surgery method was accurate. The screenplay was<br />really entertaining from the introduction to the ending.<br />Anyone with an historical interest in naval warfare during this era will enjoy it.  This becomes one of my movie library<br />favorites. Some of the scenes being made aboard a real sailing warship grabs the viewer and never lets go.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I don't need to read documents on my phone very often, but this little app has done the trick every time.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|It just did not have the power of any of the Broadway productions saw it three times  each with different cast and this even had a main character played by Russell Crowe who should learn to lip sync while someone else sings.
B004GYY714|3.0|I have found that this app is not able to receive all of the radio stations that my car stereo can.
B000I9VZKW|4.0|I liked the movie and the portrayal of a robotic-run world. However, there was one thing I thought was amusing about this movie. It is set about 10 or 20 years in the future and there's no way in 10 to 20 years we'll be that advanced AND in complete belief of the perfection of technology (there would definitely be more critics and people who do not believe that robots are infallible).<br /><br />What is thought provoking about this movie is the question, &#34;what do we owe to the things we create.&#34; There is one human-like robot in this movie in the sense that it has emotions, free choice, and can lie. So what does it mean to destroy it? Does it mean anything if it says &#34;I dont want to die&#34; or &#34;I'm scared to die.&#34; I think the movie AI and play stations clip about Kara (found on youtube) are do a good job of showing how the line between human and robot begins to blur when the mechanical beings are coupled with very human like attributes. This movie is about the first experience with a human-like robot and how a robot in every home can turn into a robot army.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Being the father of 4 kids, we see our share of lame kids movies. This, however, is an entertaining flick for the whole family!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I'm a little late to the party for this show but I very much enjoy it. And since getting my Roku 3, I can enjoy it with closed captions so I don't keep everyone up at night with the louder volume I sometimes require.
B0055S348W|1.0|I'm not sure what the problem with this app was, but I could never get it to print anything to our wireless network printer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|How we love you!!!<br /><br />I will probably breakdown and buy the rest of the season! I'm hooked onto this show.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I use this app for work every couple of weeks and it does a great job of capturing a document clearly.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I read this book for the first time as homework in 7th grade... this story has never left me. It is everything you could want in a book.... I've read it numerous time and it touches me every time.... I 100% recommend :D
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Cool flick. Decide for yourself whether the story was one big cluster of metaphors e.g. Pi was the tiger,  etc.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Excellent read. A woman lost in her own life finding peace and herself while hiking hundreds of miles of wildness on her own.
B0067R0APK|3.0|to tthink, my review could possible persuade anyone is laughable.  Stick to the ad base one, @ 2.99 stay with the free.  Did you really need anyone to tell you free is better.  Ok kids, which is better purchase or free.  Free because you can spend the money on something you want off the dollar menu.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|This one goes down as a classic comedy! Brilliantly produced, directed, and written! Great acting and storyline that makes me laugh out loud!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Simple graphics but very entertaining, levels increase in difficulty just enough to keep you interested. Always leaves you wanting to do one more level,great fun would highly recommend.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone that like Jimi Hendrix and his music.  It's odd to hear new music, but it is all good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What I said in title. Great great great wonderful inspiring incredible cant wait for the film. Will there be a film? Oh yeah.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved it from the beginning. Love all of her books. Let me know when her next one is available. Thank you.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I thought this was a very good movie with great special effects. Sad to say I didn't read the book so it helps tie in all the characters from the Rings trilogy.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Is a pretty fun app just have to be careful about spending money can be hard to build it back up to level up and buy more stuff. But really fun to create your own park. And make the different dinosaurs
B00760BPOC|4.0|Martin manages to maintain the intensity of his epic. Each chapter draws you along keen for the next. There is some ambiguity over who is good but the bad are so bad...I find my self wishing they'd get their just desserts, and they just don't!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its a little repetitive but overall a very neat game nice to play innuour spare time fun to slash em up
0307887448|5.0|I just can't express completely how fun this book was to read.  This book is not just a nostalgia piece, it was practically a celebration and revival of much of my childhood.  But, even that isn't totally fair.  Put aside all the 80's references to movies and videogames, and you are STILL left with a great adventure that is well told, funny, and very exciting.  Often times I couldn't put this book down without reading at least 3 chapters at a time.  If you have any appreciation at all for vintage 80's games and culture AND/OR want to read a great exciting adventure/quest novel, look no further.  Ready Yourself, Player One, and pick this book up.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoy watching the first two seasons and now we are watching the third.  Great story, and nice to be able to stream this whenever and wherever we would like.
B000009RC2|5.0|This is IT.  One of the most important strands in the jazz rock style is \\"guitar fusion\\", and it really started here.  (Not a diss against the great electric Miles albums, Emergency, Weather Report, etc. amazing recordings which led in completely different directions.)<br /><br />Yes, it's the pioneer, it spawned a ton of imitators, and none that I've heard come close to consistently matching its awesomeness since - not even Mahavishnu itself (at least on its official recordings).  Birds of Fire is great but has some fluff.  Between Nothingness and Eternity (the original album) matches Flame's intensity but not its focus.  Later lineups of Mahavishnu were, at best, mixed bags.<br /><br />Everybody else has talked about the tracks, so I won't spend too much time on those, but my favorites are \\"Meeting of the Spirits\\" (an amazing kickoff track), \\"Noonward Race\\" (that McLaughlin-Cobham duet!), \\"You Know You Know\\" (my favorite of the more quiet tracks on the album), and the absolutely nutty \\"Awakening\\".  Oh, and let's not forget the absolutely best thing recorded under the MO brand, \\"The Dance of Maya\\".<br /><br />Essential!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great writing from Julian Fellows. Even more depth and breadth of each of the characters. Great drama even better than the first season.
B009FBX5M0|1.0|....or perhaps the cast of Disney characters, but without Mickey, etc.  A fraud as another reviewer labeled it.  That's what this album is, the movie soundtrack but missing the feature title theme/title song by Adele.  Boo hiss !!  How stupid and selfish of someone in the producer chain.<br /><br />(how on earth did these \\"5 star\\"  reviewers give it 5 stars with this glaring issue)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I finally have a calculator that I can see! It fills up my Kindle Fire HD screen and the soft colors are easy on these old eyes. Bravo Digitalchemy, LLC.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very nice and suspenseful to the continuation of the Hunger Games.<br />I would recommend the Hunger Games and any of Suzanne Collins' books.
034580404X|5.0|This one is perfect for the beach or any vacation or alone time.  It's not a &#34;how to&#34;, it's somewhere between &#34;WOW!&#34; and&#34;Really?&#34; Be careful though, you don't want to stop reading.  I read each one in two days or less and I do work full time.
0767802519|4.0|Got this for a friend, I liked it, but she absolutely loved it! I can't believe how young Natalie Portman was in it... but it was a good role for her, non the less.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Really good movie with a great message about the importance of setting goals, strong will power, perseverance, and accomplishing anything you set your mind to. One of those great (but rare) movies you can watch with the entire family. My daughter loved it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was great right up until the ending. I did not like the ending at all. It was very abrupt and not at all realistic.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|If you like musicals and crying then you will probably like this movie. I honestly thought it would be stupid, but by the end I was in love with it!
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|Started watching Walking Dead because I follow Chris Hardwick's Nerdist podcasts and pretty much enjoy most everything he gets nerdy over so I thought I had to at least give it a chance since he was such a huge fan w/his Talking Dead show. I watched Season 1 & 2 on Netflix in just two days and was so hooked I started paying for each episode on Season 3 via Amazon Prime... it was REALLY hard to wait for new episodes once I caught up with the season about mid-way through. I do not consider myself a big horror fan but this show is different (like everyone else says), the pace is basically perfect, and what I really like is all the twists and turns the characters take, and that no character is ever truly safe in this war zone like, zombie apocalypse world... no random red shirt appearances on this show for sure and every character whether you love 'em or hate 'em, well you never know how long they have!<br /><br />I do wish Amazon carried The Talking Dead after show as well. We haven't had cable for a year now and between Netflix, Hulu+ and Amazon Prime streaming/purchasing I am all set and only pay for the shows that really matter to me, like this one! Can NOT wait until Season 4! Seriously, you are missing an historic TV phenomenon if you aren't watching the Walking Dead!
B007P6VM04|5.0|I love watching the TV series, SMASH, and I am enjoying this CD as I hear these great, new songs again and again.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I really enjoyed to play this game! There are a lot of fine puzzles, a good plot. Thank you for making this fun game!
B000F3T3CS|5.0|What a joyous production of a beautiful opera? This was fun from beginning to end, and what an exhibition of the range and beauty of the human voice si is! Even people who say they don't like opera will love this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Dude this game is freaking awesome and addicting i love it!!!!! <3 you should buy this game because you will enjoy it . I play it alot . If you want to you can add me on face book and we can compete maddogg keller (mimi) (: byee
B0023S50DO|4.0|Although older, this movie is not just action but a strong drama and includes great special effects for when it was made, great plot and nice character development.  I will watch this again.
0399534601|2.0|I could have saved myself some money if I looked through the book. The majority of the book is about picking up things you find on the ground and collecting them.<br /> All Smith goes on about is how if you are bored with your surroundings you're just not looking hard enough, it didn't work for me at all, the book just didn't have that THING in it. Felt like randomness glued together.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a regular and voracious reader who rarely writes reviews. This one deserves positive comment even though I will be one if many voices saying the same thing. I read the 5 books as a long novel so I didn't have to wait for the next installment. I found the story compelling, the characters real, and the logic consistent. This is a believable story that takes place in a future that could actually happen. So as much as it could be called science fiction it really is more likely literary and thriller that happens to be situated in a different time. If you haven't read here books do yourself a favour and pay the $6. Eventually this guys work will cost $14 and it will still be a bargain.
B005DJREGQ|2.0|I would not recommend this to anyone but definitely not children or teenagers.  It is full of fornication, and teaches that it is cool and ok for parents to do illegal drugs.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was a great book with perfect insight! I've been recommending it to everyone. It gripped me page after page!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A little slow but very enjoyable.  Every episode has something uplifting and leaves you with the feeling of wanting to watch more.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Worked fine with Windows 8 Intel pc and a dbx Driverack 260 speaker controller. Made upgrading from an older PC with built-in serial less of a headache.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Very cute movie.  We really enjoyed it.  It would be nice if Tinkerbell behaved better.  She is always getting away with bad behavior and every thing turning out ok.  It requires some teaching when we view it, but well made and entertaining.
B00006JIA4|5.0|What can I say.  I love Queen's music.  It's a great addition to my collection and I have enjoyed it.
1416595554|1.0|I love the book, I realized how little I knew about Russia History and I am how reading a history of Russia.  I didn't choose the novel it was the selection of the book club which I am a member..  I plan to read the other novels written by Sebag Montefiore.
0062082353|5.0|I ordered this book for my husband for Christmas.  What a tragic lost when Chris Kyle was shot in February.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|It is nice to have something to watch that is not shocking the senses at every turn. This was a good portrayal of the book and we wish there were more like this.
0525953728|5.0|I ordered this for my husband and I plan on reading it myself.  I've seen Mark Owen interviews and want to read it.
1469226421|5.0|This book is on cd and I have listened to it on the way to work, on short trips, etc.  Have truly enjoyed the detailed descriptions, the narrators accent, the entire book so far.  I'm listening slowly-don't want it to end.
B00004T0US|5.0|Hey, I love Elvis.  This is a good cd.  I have enjoyed this cd, it plays a lot of his last songs.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I was on a road trip and able to view it on google earth as I went.  It was cool.
0761171703|5.0|A wonderful book with fabulous pictures of dancers sometimes in extreme circumstances, sometimes in ordinary places but it so well done and fun to read (Matter gives info about each photo at the back of the book) that I've been giving the book as gifts to people I know and the response has been terrific.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This is a fabulous movie. It's important to see that some people devote their lives to the betterment of others. Truly inspiring.
B0067LY4WG|4.0|I like this CD a lot, but it doesn't to my mind meet the standards of his earlier music.  Still I enjoy having it.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|great action flick !!!  too bad it only had 2 seasons. My husband hates these types of movies but he loves these.
B00005Q45W|4.0|This album is co-written with Sharon Robinson and her voice does add a lot to the musical accompaniment.  Cohen is in a more subdued phase of his life, reflecting as usual on life, spirituality, forgiveness, struggles and of course on sex.  Not as much variety of mood here, and as I remarked in another review I don't think this is as great as some of his earlier albums.  Still, Cohen is a poet whose writing are set to music and he is definitely worth listening to.
B004XVMCMQ|1.0|Leave it to Hollywood to take the simple purity of a Jane Austen romance and turn it into trash.<br /><br />Not only do we get a first-hand look at the infidelity only referenced in the book, but Hollywood also adds a near lesbian scene and obscene drawings depicting rape.  If you are a fan of Jane Austen this movie will shock and disterb you.
B009RWRIKM|5.0|The film by Wim Weders is a wonderful tribute to Pina's life work, in this look back by Wim Wenders.  It features the dancers on working with Pina although I wish they had been identified while talking.  But even more wonderful are the clips of her works, focusing on four of the major ones, including my favorite - her version of Rite of Spring done on stage with real earth, and Kontarthof with different aged casts, Vollmond performed in water and contemporary versions as well as past clips of Pina in Cafe Muller.  If you love dance and don't see this film, you will be missing out on a great experience.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This is my favorite Jane Austen book.  I wonder why it isn't more popular.  I thought the film adaption wonderful.<br /><br />Catherine is a romance-novel addict who is tkaen from her country farm to the city of Bath.  She is a young girl having her first glimpse of society.  And when she falls for Henry Tilney and is invited to his estate, she lets her imagination get the best of her.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This album is the greatest!!  It's all about Jesus!  Nothing more to be said!  Have not been able to stop listening to this album since I received it and that's about three weeks ago :-)
B0061QD82E|5.0|It is a great movie for kids becasue you can rest easy that there is no sexual content or curse words
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Friends got me started on this when I received my Kindle as a gift. I raised trained and showed horses professionally for 20 years and this game satisfies my<br />inner horse nut. All the fun, no bills, no worries. The app does have a few limitations I find annoying, but the ads don't bother me a bit. The developers have created a virtual horse with amazingly realistic motion. Very impressive, right down to scratching, grazing and enjoying a good grooming. I was expecting a very cartoon-like horse but was surprised at the realistic behaviors.<br />Some aspects are silly, like costumes and hats for horsey holiday wear, and punk rock manes in rainbow colors, But for the most part I enjoy this game a lot and spend waaay too much time caring for my horse and training for the next level of competitions.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kids love this game and play it all the time.  I have been known to play it as well, the only problem is, once you start you can't stop!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It's SO TERRIBLE it's worst than the first one!!!!! Sure, it has new things, but they're LAME!!!!!! I'm happy that I didn't have to pay for it.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|This game is pretty cool, and can lead to hours of not getting anything of value done in your life.  I did drop one star because it can be hard to rotate the puzzle exactly how you want to.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|The movie is very slow and confusing in the beginning but does become quite exciting in the latter part. Film  is too long.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids and I love to play this game.  It is very hard to put down and can cause you to waste far too much time, but at least you'll be having fun.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The book is especially wonderful, for dog lovers', everywhere,, but would a great read for anyone! I  Try it, please!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book started out slow and never really developed the characters.  I would have liked to have know more about the characters, their jobs and their town or family.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just loved this novel. Nicholas Sparks has been a favorite author of mine for years. I haven't read this until now and would recommend this to anyone who loves a mystery romance.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Some of the scenes in the movie seem to be drawn out too long. The effects were good though and a decent loyalty to the original book.
B009BJAV7S|5.0|The acting is brilliant, the characters develop beautifully, the mysteries are always clever and give me shivers, and Benedict Cumberbatch......hnnng<3
0399160450|5.0|Great read...fast paced...Junior and his Team are going to make Clancy a bunch more $$$. A very seamless and believable transition from the original Jack Ryan to Junior !!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Regardless of age, the content and writing of these books will grip just about anyone that enjoys an engaging read. Very thorough and detailed as to not let you go. Catching fire has me excited to start reading Mockingjay. Highly recommended.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this to use with my JBL on stage player, it has a firewire connector which will not fit iphone 4,4s needing a 30 pin adaptor.<br />this allows me to listen to the player and it also charges my phone,  just what I needed.
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|I liked HOG&B part one a lot. I bought part two and immediately did not like it as much as part one. However, after a week of listening to part two in my car... it has grown into as good of a CD as part one. Both discs have had one or two songs that I liked and then a third... then a fourth... and so on. I like how both discs have &#34;expanded&#34; as I've listened to them. The two CD' s are great.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This app is frap. Go with a different form of mine craft. This one is a very generic form of it!
0345525558|5.0|I read this book for the book club I belong to.  I did not pick this out myself but this is one of the best books I've read in a long time and by far the most enjoyable book I've read in my book club.  This book was written beautifully and was very interesting and realistic.  I had three weeks to read it and finished it in 2 days.  It mad me think and appreciate my life and be more aware of others.  It also educated me about flowers too!  Overall I though it was excellent!
B00BD6EJRK|2.0|First of all its primarily a collage app.  In order to get any special effects other then a few filters you have to buy them separately.  Without them this app is useless.  For 3.99 this should be included.  Funny how they don't bother to mention this.  Without buying extra, this is only for collages.  Definitely I say don't buy.  It's a scAm :-(
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Truly love this watch and will honestly recommended to someone looking for a good affordable an good looking watch<br />P.A Hahn
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I have been listening to hard rock/heavy metal almost all my life and this album BY FAR is probably the best album I've ever heard!!!!You won't fast forward through any songs on this album because EVERY SONG KICKS ASS!!!.....How did it all start? Well legend has it that it is what could have happened if Elvis's third cousin had gotten out of juvenile detention, started hanging out with Johnny Cash and Gene Vincent and the ﬁrst thing they got their hands on was a Slayer album. He would be singing metal a la Volbeat and vis a vis Michael Poulsen.<br />YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!....ALBUMS LIKE THIS DON'T COME AROUND TO OFTEN
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I am all about movies with respectable women (young or old) that rise to a challenge and kick butt. I love the multifaceted elements of each character in this movies and watching these grow as the movie progresses. Love the way that Katness shows that big wigs up with her final clever ploy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book! Would definitely recommend it to all my friends. Could not stop reading the book from the time I started.it!!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I enjoy this moving not only for the fiesty red headed girls personality that is on the cover of the movie but more importantly for the object lesson that it can teach kids and parents as well. I don't know what to tell too much as to now give away the story. :) Watch it, because it is most enjoyable.
0439023521|3.0|After reading about this book in the New Yorker, I was really looking forward to reading the book. After reading it,  I have to say that I am perplexed by the cult-like following that it seems to have attracted. This is probably the highest ranked book on GoodReads and I am quite sure that it does not deserve that. Although this does not really affect my rating, it is hard for me to write about the book without mentioning it.<br /><br />The good<br /><br />I found the book well written and easy to read (in a good sense). It makes good use of the first person narrator (Katniss) who is telling us her story with some perspective. The character is interesting and engaging. She is brave in the face of challenges that nobody should have to face. And she is  talented and smart. I can see how she is attractive to many readers. In some ways she reminds me of Bilbo or Frodo Baggins ([[ASIN:0345538374 J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (Movie Tie-in): The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King]])-- who started out innocent and weak and were forced to adapt to many challenges. Granted the hobbits were quite a bit richer than Katniss!<br /><br />I also appreciate the use of dystopian world to criticize some excessed in our world. A good book should talk to us in a meaningful way.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />However, the story itself is some predictable. Of course, lots of stories are and are still fun. But since the world and character seem quite unreal to me, the challenge also does not seem real. There is nothing wrong with making up a world and this does not normally bother me. But  the best fictional world have a certain internal logic to them. Panem (the country where Katniss lives) does not. It seems to be in our world and yet the economy does not too much sense (10,000 people living in a district mining coal in a rather primitive and inefficient way in a futuristic society with a lot pretty amazing technology).<br /><br />I don't believe that there is a girl like Katniss or a world like Panem. They just seem too perfect (the former) and imperfect (the latter) to me. Although there are a lot of really good heroes in the literary world, it is pretty normal to give them a flaw or two. It makes the story more interesting and all the more satisfying. I guess Katniss has her arrogance, her poverty, and her absolute devotion to her family.<br /><br />Yes, I get the idea of the adolescent rage at the system or the need to rebel or something. And the book shows a strong and spunky protagonist who is doing just that. And yes, I understand the need to scream about all of the commercialism and \\"reality\\" shows out there. But somehow, I think that if these are the main issues, the story should have a setting that one can relate to.<br /><br />And I find the violence a bit disturbing. Some books are able to have to great battles without actually showing the blood. Think about the Hobbit (the book, not the movie!), there is lot of fighting but how is it described? I suppose if you want to make a point about the horror of wars or something, you might want to show the pain and the blood and so on. But I don't think that this is the case here at all. In such stories, the ending is not predictable. Also the gratuity almost stands in contrast to the book's anti-commerical and reality show message...we are the ones enjoying it.<br /><br />If you want a spunky girl who has to show unexpected courage (courage beyond the call of anybody's duty), what about [[ASIN:0061743526 To Kill a Mockingbird: 50th Anniversary Edition]]? This to me is a story that is every bit as exciting and not particularly predictable. And a heck of lot more profound. Orson Scott Card's [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]] also deals with youth thrown into an impossible and unfair situation. Both of these points manage to make their points quite effectively without any of the violence.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Besr flight app I have tried!  I never get tired of playing, gets progressively more difficult.  This is my favorite app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It's just what I have been looking for! My sister lives it too! I recommend this game very much. Parents you will love this game and so will your kids!
1469220660|1.0|There is no possible way for me to review the book. It was ordered twice and each time recieved copies in CD form with no way to use them..Was told to do what ever I want with them .However I do still have them and would prefer to have my book that was ordered....
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|I've been a fan since I bought Horror Show back in 2001. I include myself in the majority group that think Matt Barlow will always be the voice of Iced Earth, but newcomer Stu Block is nothing short of spectacular here. He has the low and high range of Barlow, plus he can scream as high as the bands previous vocalist, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens. If you weren't totally sold on him after Dystopia (I think most were), this 2 1/2 hour live performance will make you a believer. The band is tight and the energy from the crowd is unlike any concert DVD/Blu-ray that I own.<br /><br />This is a great buy for the price. You get 2 CDs and 1 DVD that capture the entire show, along with a few extras that show the making of this one of a kind concert that was filmed on some ancient stone ruins. The picture is near Blu-ray quality and the sound is loud and broken up nicely.<br /><br />With founder/guitarist Jon Schaffer leading the way and Stu delivering the lyrics, Iced Earth should be cranking out nothing but classics in the near future. It's also refreshing to know that an American band is representing \\"Iron Maiden\\" style metal, when most of the better bands right now are from Europe. Looking forward to what they come up with next.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Excellent book. Very entertaining and detailed. Characters completely developed and well described. Can't wait to read book #4! Highly recommend is book, but suggest starting with the first book to follow better.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I haven't played ICO yet but Shadow of the Colossus is a great game and visually fantastic. lots of fun.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|This movie is mildly entertaining. I am glad I did not waste my money going to see it in theaters but it was worth the few bucks here.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book was hard for me to get into. Wrapping my head around small town politics was boring, and often I found myself wondering what the point of the election plot line was, as it didn't really make a huge impact on the novel as a whole. I was much more interested in the stories of the students and they way they viewed their town and the adults that run it. Despite this book's flaws, it's beautifully written in true Rowling form. Don't go into this story expecting an adult Harry Potter. This US a huge change of pace from the story we all fell in love with.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|... and I would go and see them all. I love the Bourne movies and can't wait for the next one. This one is done well and fun to watch.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|If you LOVE books and mysteries. Old bookstores, cats, travel, amazing characters this book is a MUST read!! I have it audio and am so happy it is on my Kindle! This is the fist book I can pass on to friends and all have loved it!
B009HELT3C|5.0|This was a good movie and fun to watch. I liked how they continued to build the characters and their backgrounds.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Loved this book! Loved this movie....HATE THE ENDING IN BOTH :\\"(  but I guess they all can't be happily ever after. ..
031606792X|5.0|I love the book!! Will definitely be reading again. I could not put it down from start to finish.  Sad the series had to come to an end.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|My favorite thing about PcketinvEditor is that I can change my game from creative to survival or the other way around.<br /><br />Love it!!!
B00B7H3OFI|5.0|Right from the first seconds of listening I was hooked. With so much formulaic music out there this is a real breath of fresh air. The first four tunes are upbeat funk-jams with a variety of melodic and rhythmic feels. Then track 5 is a long but slower tune that will sweep you away. Up next are three more upbeat funk-jams followed by another relaxed tempo tune. The tunes are cool, the performances are flawless and the solos are inspired. You'll find a lot to like here. There's a hidden track after 4 minutes of silence. That four minute wait is the only complaint I have: just get on with it!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great show! Really disappointed it got canceled, bought it on bluray so we can watch it whenever. Serenity is also fantastic!!
B00005OOQ5|5.0|Its what you would expect from Cirque, family entertainment ,oohs ,ahhs , and all the other stuff that goes along with that. This is just as awesome as everything else I've seen of Cirque du Soliel!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't wait until season 4! I was tired of waiting for HBO to bring back True Blood and now I am not sure I will watch True Blood because AMC's Walking Dead is written very well and the character development is excellent...watch out HBO.
1400069807|3.0|Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss is more about the science, history and battles for market share of the food industry, than its overweight customers.  What it really bought home for me was the fact that it appears all foods that make big profits are foods that the industry has packed with more energy than a male elephant could burn up in a year, then they advertise it to all the mommies as healthy, which it probably is, if you have one of those genetic diseases that causes your metabolism to behave like a blast furnace.  The truth of the matter is that humans have for the most part OVER SOLVED our food problem and Nature is no longer in control.  The new problem is now we humans are in charge, we don't seem to know how to make it all work, like nature did.  This book is a good place to learn about the Industry and the problems they have and are causing.  Now they know how the food industry needs to go back to the lab and develop healthy stuff that has NO ENERGY in it so we can all burn off the excess we have already accrued.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I love reading Brandon Sanderson he thinks fantasy completely different to other authors. I couldnt put the fabulous book down

B008OOYALE|1.0|When trying to visit neighbors this game CRASHES all the time!Dragon story would also be a great game but have to spend Way too much real money to advance or clear forest
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Rachel McAdams is wonderful as usual and Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford make for a great dynamic. Really enjoyed the movie.
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|Not entertaining to me....Did not hold my interest.  Designed for others;  Childish, elementary, simple, boring, toy like, and boring boring.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My sons rain machine would shut off after 50 minutes and sometimes es this would wake him up. This app is great. I run it all night, home, travel, or camping.
B00BJS7104|2.0|Having read some other reviews that said this was the best movie ever, I would just ask...why? I don't mind the explosions, the fact that a shotgun can spill 5 gallons of blood, or that a pistol can send a person flying 5 feet from being shot (even though Newton would argue, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction...so, the shooter would have to fly back 5 feet too) I don't mind the fact that a free/semi-free slave is more interested in saving his GF than freeing enslaved people. I DO mind the fact that this movie provided ZERO suspense and must see scenes. I am a huge fan of GT movies, but this movie was awful. Maybe it is the controversial aspect of slavery and the stain and horror that it was. Maybe it was the impending 600k lives that were lost, all which this movie does nothing to address other than the sickening overuse of the N word, which boils my skin every time I hear it.<br /><br />Oh...and the music sucks.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun game for whiling away the time waiting in Dr. office or other waiting rooms.  But they keep beating me.  I'm just not very good at it.  But like it anyway.

One of the most important pieces of information given in the book is Kerpen's explanation of the importance of audience engagement and company/consumer relationships, something that is overlooked by companies all too often.<br /><br />Although at first glance many of the tips offered in Likeable Social Media appear to be common sense, reading into them you will most certainly find yourself thinking, \\"Hey that makes sense.  Why didn't I think of that?\\"  That being said, I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to create an online presence for themselves or their brand.
0307887448|3.0|My brothers told me to read this book. I'm not that big a gamer, I do play on occasion, and as much as I wanted to be swept into this world I just wasn't. It's an awesome concept but I thought the characters were a tad thin and I didn't care about them as much as I wanted to.
0553815229|2.0|Its a historical novel, not much truth in here. But sort of a fun read.<br />This series is not anything that a person who has studied history for decades will want to read, but if you are looking for some entertainment, then its not bad.<br />But certainly not a good read for anybody who knows history.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|This is the second movie I have rented in which the streaming was terrible. I have a newer Samsung tv I purchased from Amazon last fall, so it's not the television. I checked my internet service and it is working fine.

B00BJS7104|5.0|The man knows how to tell a story and his dialog is always intriguing. The music fits better than a glove. Waltz and DiCaprio do a fine job and Jamie Foxx did a hell of a lot better than I would have thought based on some other reviewers (Amazon and mainstream media). Kerry Washington is incredibly beautiful and talented... she makes the most out of her small role displaying a wide range of emotion.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite Tarantino film but it is damn good. QT fans will not be disappointed.

0062238868|5.0|Let me start out by saying this is a must buy. It tells the tale about a true American hero, and his journey. Talks about where he came from, his training, his personal views, all with a little humor. Reading this story made me realize that we both have a lot in common. RIP CPO Chris Kyle.

B0067QPVJ6|2.0|Compared to the 1982 version, this 2011 version is slow, has none of the tension and has creature scenes done just for the FX sake without being part of the mystery as the J. Carpenter version did.  One scene that bothered me:  They catch the creature after it absorbed one of the crew half-way, so they burn it.  Then Ms. Winstead says &#34;It's still among us.&#34;. What?  How did she come to that assumption and conclusion?  In the JC version, the crew thought the danger was over after they burned the creature, the little by little we were shown how the creature survived the burning and continued to terrorize, adding to the mystery and suspense.  Watch the JC version instead.

030758836X|1.0|The characters are presented in the first chapter, and they are who they are -- they don't evolve or change or grow -- there is no development in them.  I was hoping for a good story, but I knew by the end of the first chapter what was going to happen -- and it did.  Thus, it took me all of an hour to read the book;  and when it came time to discuss it at book club, I found (as I suspected) that I had not missed a thing.  Don't bother.

B009AMANBA|3.0|Because I really did not get it and do not understand what sigfificance it makes to todays current modern day times, it's an historical document<br /> of Lincoln's times and has nothing to really tell me about what's going on in todays world so I don't really know why it was Spielberg chose to make it at this<br /> time in history. I still do not believe the sayers that think that the rebel southern flag was a symbol of slavery, it was a battlefield flag to me that in<br /> my strong opinion had nothing to do with the freeing of the slaves which I still believe that the black people cannot let that issue go even to this very day.<br /> Because in many ways we are still fighting the civil war to this very day. It's a modern day war about civility which we cannot conquer.

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I was a little disappointed with how the story was developed.  The characters were ok but I think that they could have been more done with the SEALs that took the mission.  The CIA analyst character was very well done but the story was not just about her but the movie just concentrated on her actions.  There were many agencies and people involved in getting OBL and that should have been touched on.  The Team of SEALs that took the mission are the TRUE HEROES of this story and more should have been done to bring that out.

075669910X|5.0|This book fully deserves all the 5-star reviews. For anyone interested in ancient lifeforms, this is the indispensable book. Much more than dinosaurs, which are among the more recent examples of prehistoric life. Incredible illustrations and representative fossils of almost ubelievable lifeforms, be they plant or animal. Another nice feature is the scale drawing which demonstrates the size the long-gone critters as compared to humans - thank goodness many of them are no longer around. This was, at various times, a planet inhabited by some very bizarre creatures. This book would be well worth the cost at four times the advertised price. Not just a \\"dinosaur book\\" for kids - this will provide hours of fascination for interested adults.

Anita clearly told about her life leading up to her near death experience, the NDE, and what her life has been like following it.

B007REV4T8|1.0|SKYFALL - Watching this for the first time. One of the most Boring films I have ever seen (And I usually like Bond) Dialog seems contrived (reminded me of Antonioni in the 60's, everyone so filled with \\"Ennuie\\" and so jaded) and the film and actors have as much energy as a dildo with a battery on its last 2 volts. Horrific, I did not feel that I was watching a Bond film. The annoying banger \\"Who cares\\" keeps rattling in your head and  I just quit watching after 67 minutes.

B0090SI4LU|3.0|I am not aware of the book. I have yet to see any of the Twilight series.<br />I wanted to give it 2.5. Loved the Desert scenery.<br /><br />Generally, after I have seen a movie I like to have 'a feeling' a feeling of something. I kept looking at my watch..looking at my almost empty box of popcorn. I, didn't feel empty, I just didn't feel anything. Not a good sign. Should I stay, should I go.<br />That new Defiance TV series (first 2 Episodes) has more to offer.<br /><br />Wait for the Host DVD....Rental.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|In his follow-up effort to 2010's Tron: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski brings us Oblivion, a visually striking and futuristic sci-fi epic that boasts a strong performance from Tom Cruise and an intriguing, albeit recycled, story.<br /><br />In 2017, Earth is transformed and deemed inhospitable due to an invasion by an alien race nicknamed the Scavs. Sixty years after this event, the human race has abandoned the planet for the Saturn moon of Titan. Only two humans remain, Jack (played by Tom Cruise), a security repairman who is tasked with fixing security drones, and Victoria (played by Andrea Riseborough), Jack's communications officer and partner. Due to join their fellow compatriots on the enormous space station known as the TET in two weeks, a vessel crash-lands on Earth and causes Jack to question everything he knows about the people he trusts, his mission, and ultimately himself.<br /><br />The biggest achievement of the film belongs to Kasinski, who's vision and direction make this film an absolute wonder to behold. Much like Tron: Legacy, Oblivion contains breathtaking landscapes and dazzling futuristic designs. The look and feel of decimated Earth is truly spectacular and oddly realistic. It's an amazing achievement in visual effects, and it's for this reason alone that seeing the film is worth it.<br /><br />Another impressive factor of the movie is the cast, which is quite small. Jack and Victoria get the bulk of the screen time as the first half of the film is devoted almost entirely to them. Luckily, Cruise and Riseborough have a great chemistry and pull of the \\"last two people on Earth\\" thing quite nicely. Cruise continues to prove age has not diminished his action-star status and he's particularly good here. The film is more character-driven than the previews would have you believe so having a versatile and well-known actor in the lead spot is a definite plus. A lot of credit also has to be given to Riseborough who is absolutely brilliant in her role as the content worker bee who doesn't want to see the facts laid out in front of her.<br /><br />The one caveat most people seem to have with the movie is that it heavily borrows ideas from many other sci-fi flicks, including Moon, the Matrix, Total Recall, and Eagle Eye to name a few. I find this kind of silly because most sci-fi films borrow from each other in some way or another and while most of Oblivion's ideas may not be entirely original, the execution and visuals more than make up for this. It's an inventive and strikingly beautiful sci-fi epic that holds it's own when it comes to character development and overall story. If you're a fan of sci-fi (or any of the above-mentioned films) definitely check this out.ontent worker bee who doesn't want to see the facts laid out in front of her.<br /><br />The one caveat most people seem to have with the movie is that it heavily borrows ideas from many other sci-fi flicks, including Moon, the Matrix, Total Recall, and Eagle Eye to name a few.

1609611543|5.0|I AM WRITING TO LET YOU BE AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF GETTING RID OF THE WHEAT OF TODAY'S FOOD. THE WHEAT IS NOT THE WHEAT OF OUR FORE FATHERS. THE WHEAT HAS BEEN ALTERED AND IT IS NOT THE SAME AS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. ALL FOODS ARE BEING ALTERED SO AS THAT MORE FOODS CAN BE PRODUCED FASTER AND UNHEALTHIER. CAN GOODS, FORGET ABOUT AS THEY ARE NOT ANY GOOD FOR YOU. YES THEY WILL FILL YOUR STOMACH, BUT NOT WITH NUTRITION. I WAS HAVING SEVERE BACK PAINS, SHOULDER PAINS, JOINT PAINS BASICALLY FROM AGE, AND AFTER BEING TOLD I WOULD NEED BACK SHOTS TO EASE THE PAIN TEMPORARILY, I HAD LEARNED FROM A ELDERY COUPLE ABOUT THE WHEAT BELLIES BOOK. HAVING TAKEN THEM UP ON THE SUBJECT, WE CHECKED THE BOOK OUT OF THE LIBRARY AND AFTER READING A BIT OF IT, I ORDERED IT ON AMAZON. I'VE NEVER LOOKED BACK OTHER THAN SAYING THANK YOU THOSE PEOPLE FOR BRINGING IT TO MY ATTENTION. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, TRY IT. YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR CRAVINGS. THE PAIN OF YOUR MUSCLES, BACK PAIN WILL SUBSIDE. I MYSELF CAN SAY THAT WITH OUT THE NEED FOR THOSE \\"FRIGGIN NEEDLES\\" IN MY BACK AND OR JOINTS. I FEEL SO SO MUCH BETTER. THE DOCTOR'S ARE AMAZED AS WELL, BUT MOST OF ALL, THE LOST OF THE PAIN FROM THE LOST OF WHEAT. ALSO, CHECK OUT \\"NIGHT SHADES\\" ON YOUR COMPUTER. YES, \\"NIGHT SHADES\\" STOP THEM AS WELL. POTATOES, EGG PLANTS, BELL PEPPERS, TOMATOES. READ OF THEM, SERIOUSLY. NO JOKES! THEY CREATE PAIN. I AM GRATEFUL FOR LEARNING OF IT AND IT HAS SAVED MEDICAL FEES IN BILLING THAT I CAN USE FOR SOMETHING MORE PLEASURABLE. OF ALL DIETS, THIS WILL WORK FOR YOU BETTER THN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF. DROP WHEAT, YOU DO NOT REQUIRE IT AS I HAVE FOUND OUT.<br />I AM A CANCER PATIENT, A DIABETIC AND OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS AS WELL. I HAVE LEARNED AND I HAVE ALSO DROPPED 14 LBS IN THREE WEEKS. NO JOKES INVOLVED. GOOD LUCK
B003G4W49C|4.0|I almost gave up at the halfway mark. Glad I kept going because when all is said and done, it's a terrific book.  For me, the first half was a bit of a grinder with long dawn out scenes in weightlessness with boys staging game battles that were vague, boring, with little or no emotional value, coupled with more very long and boring scenes of Ender playing a computer game that meant nothing to me until the very end of the book. I just could not get a good clear picture in my mind. I also had issues with the saturated use of the word \\"isolated.\\"  It might seem like nitpicking, but this little thing kept pulling me out of the story. Ender is never really isolated. Rather, he's singled out, bullied, despised, feared. Yes he feels isolated, but that's different from the statement of fact, \\"we have to keep him isolated.\\"<br /><br />The negatives of the book, however are mostly negated by a very thoughtful and, quite honestly, poignant story conclusion, which leaves me to opine Enders Game as almost brilliant.  Several elements worth noting: The dialogue in the novel is top-notch, screen worthy, and drives the book's tenser moments; the psychology of genius children is provocative. Some readers noted it too far fetched, but I found Ender's introspection and psychoanalysis of others fascinating.

B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I was expecting to see more violent scenes but was pleasantly surprised.  The movie centered on getting the 6 hostages out of Iran.<br /><br />The plot to get the hostages back to safe ground was the best choice of all the bad ideas that the CIA could muster forth.<br /><br />Most of us know the history and how it all comes to fruition but nevertheless up to the very end we are not sure that they will make it off the ground.<br /><br />Great acting especially Alan Arkin, you just have to love this guy.<br /><br />Ben Affleck's acting and directing are superb.<br /><br />The actors who played the hostages were well chosen and the make up artists could not have done a better job.  At the end of the film, one could not tell the difference from some of the real passport pictures.<br /><br />I gave it only 4 stars because I believe Les Miserables to be the best picture.<br /><br />On another note:<br />After a nice dinner with my brother's family we watched the DVD that I brought over and many feelings came out about the Muslim nations and people.  I didn't bring up the subject as we paused to take a break, my niece talked about a new Mosque being built in our city.<br />This was my \\"opening\\" to make a point that the Muslim religion has the largest number of members and although I was not in \\"Obama\\" country, I mustered the courage to say that the president who was once Muslim was now a Christian.<br />This rose some feelings and started a dialogue that I thought brought the four of us closer.<br />I was the only one to defend the Muslim people and pointed out that there are so many extremists giving us information on all sides of the issue, that nothing is black and white and we have to explore all sides.<br />I tried to tone done the evening a bit because after all: \\"You don't bite the hand that feeds you.\\"<br /><br />Jesus did not come to start a new religion, not even Christianity, He came to bring peace to the world and He is asking us to follow Him, so that together we can change the world.we can change the world.
1612680011|1.0|I was invited to attend a free \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" seminar.  I had heard of the book, but never read it.  So, I figured, what did I have to lose by attending? Just two hours of my time, but I probably should read the book first.  Both were mistakes.  This book is supposed to be the #1 best-selling personal finance book of all time.  I don't understand why.  Any book by The Donald is far superior.  The book gives us loads of philosophy, downgrades the importance of education, and purports to tell us that we can make hundreds of thousands of dollars spending only a few hours a day and none of our money dabbling in real estate.  But, it doesn't tell us how.  Same with the seminar.  It gave the same bright future, but to learn the technique you had to attend their class.  And that was not free.  And further, you had to sign up for the class immediately.  You couldn't think about it and call or e-mail your registration.  You had to sign up before you left the room!  My thought:  The book gives nothing; to get something you have to take the course.  And if the solution to earning so much money is so easy, why isn't everybody rich?  Further, if properly edited, the actual content of the book could be reduced to a dozen pages or less.  Badly written with a lot of senseless repetition, badly edited.  Makes no cents to me.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|Our teen daughter wanted a copy to take with her to college. It's a funny movie, and certainly one that I'm glad she enjoys.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Last night's DVD was \\"RED\\" starring Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman. I found it in the  five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Well, this one has to be one of the weirdest movies I've seen in decades. It's actually hard to explain.You have to see it to believe it. The movie is very funny, but it's largely done in a straight-faced style as an action movie and concerns a group of about a half-dozen retired CIA agents. In fact, the RED stands for \\"Retired, Extremely Dangerous.\\" Okay, so these retired agents are having problems turning off their agentry. They're having trouble adjusting to normal life, to say the least. They still enjoy breaking heads, killing people in creative ways and riddling the landscape with machine-gun fire. Have you ever seen a house completely destroyed by machine-gun fire? Well, here's your chance. It's absurd, of course, but no more absurd than lots of stuff you see in action movies.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are such that I haven't laughed so hard in years. Take one scene, for example. A woman agent fires a grenade rifle at a guy who has a gun. He sees the projectile coming and fires his own conventional gun to stop it. Well, the ultra-slow-motion photography picks up the grenade projectile and the bullet heading toward one another at supersonic speed, making a precise nose-to-nose impact and causing a humongous explosion. This one will leave you wondering how did they ever do it, but you'll be crying with laughter while you're thinking about it. All sorts of other stunts fill the movie. It's a frolicking good time. Trust me.<br /><br />Do you have any questions about CIA activities? Well, this movie will flush them out into the open. I'm sure we all have strange ideas about ultra secret organizations such as the CIA and this movie preys on our anxieties. It's funny, but I'd sure like to know what a real CIA Agent thought of the movie. In this regard, there's an interesting extra feature attached to the movie and I'd suggest you watch it. It's an outstanding movie. The whole cast does an excellent acting job. It's well filmed. The stunts are magnificent. The story is far fetched, but, hey, this is a fine comedy so relax and enjoy.<br /><br />Gary Petersonoutstanding movie. The whole cast does an excellent acting job. It's well filmed.

1582701709|3.0|I have a major problem with the following paragraph on page 28:<br /><br />\\"Often when people first hear this part of the Secret they recall events in history where masses of lives were lost, and they find it incomprehensible that so many people could have attracted themselves to the event. By the law of attraction, they had to be on the same frequency as the event. It doesn't necessarily mean they thought of the exact event, but the frequency of their thoughts matched the frequency of the event. If people believe they can be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they have no control over outside circumstances, those thoughts of fear, separation, and powerlessness, if persistent, can attract them to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\"<br /><br />People really cannot control situations outside of themselves such as horrible things like the Holocaust, 9/11 or recent happenings in Boston. I think it's good to have a positive outlook but some things you cannot control no matter who you are or what you are thinking or what \\"frequency\\" you are on. I think miracles can happen...like the few people during 9/11 that decided not to go to work that day. I think when these miracles occur that angels are looking out then or it just happens that that person is lucky. It goes back to the serenity prayer about what you can control and what you cannot control.<br /><br />I have actually emailed them the following about this paragraph, my email follows:<br /><br />Hi I completely disagree with the paragraph on page 28. Please remember the serenity prayer:<br /><br />God grant me the serenity<br />to accept the things I cannot change;<br />courage to change the things I can;<br />and wisdom to know the difference.<br /><br />Think of all who have suffered in Holocaust, 9/11, Newtown, Boston, etc. It doesn't matter what \\"frequency\\" they were on. If a bad person has an intention to kill you cannot control that bad person!!!! Period the end. I am very annoyed with this partof the book. I am enjoying and like the rest of the book. Although I don't think you can think yourself thin...this does require exercise and proper food intake.<br /><br />This really is not a question but maybe a request for a rethought of that paragraph on page 28 and that those people had no control!!!! Think of Newtown and those little kids!!!!!<br /><br />Thank you for your consideration.<br /><br />Sarah Brooks
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Child just doesn't fail to deliver.  This is the 7th or 8th Reacher novel I've read, and it's exactly like the others: fun, furious, and...fun.  If you liked the others in the series, you'll enjoy this one, too.
B0094K20FK|5.0|Big star trek fan...Wrath of Khan is my most favorite movie when it comes to the original Star Trek movies
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Our family of teen, young adult, and almost empty nesters enjoy this movie. We gladly bought copies for a couple of family members.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Parts of this could have been shortened and tightened a bit, but otherwise, it is a very entertaining story of a slave who is rescued by a white bounty hunter, who helps him to find his wife.<br /><br />The cast members are excellent:  DiCaprio is terrifying, Foxx is appealing, Waltz is a joy to watch, and Don Johnson does a nice turn as plantation owner Big Daddy.<br /><br />Be forewarned that there are many extremely brutal and bloody scenes, all quite graphic and intense.  This is not for everyone.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I saw the movie in a theater before purchasing it and I had to have it to show others who missed the movie. Great story of a great man!
B009GEOLM4|5.0|This is one of my favorite animated Batman movies of all time. It was like the graphic novel came to life, with it's dark and gritty atmosphere. Every frame brought back memories of reading the graphic novel. Although the voice-acting of Peter Weller left a little be desired for (especially since I grew up watching the Batman Animated Series), he still brought an aging Bruce Wayne/Batman to life. If you're a fan of the graphic novel, or any of Frank Miller's work, this is a must watch.
B0093X805W|5.0|Amazing I loved it soooooooooo much it was great I think it's worth 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 stars fun for all ages just 1 bad word
B0063GORYU|5.0|Thought I would try this as an alternative to solitaire and it took me a little to catch on to it.  Now I can't put it down!
B00338QENI|4.0|I'm a nurse currently working for a biotech company, have previously worked in clinical trials and I loved this book. The history behind the discovery and growth and marketing of Henrietta's cells, while talking about her life, and what was explained to her or her family is a compelling read.
B0018QRV4I|3.0|Along with Carousel and the King and I, surely it's about time that these musicals are given the honor of being available on Blu-ray.<br />What's the reason for the delay?
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I think this game is very fun...challenging yet doable. And the graphics are really nice too. I just wish the full version didn't cost so much.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It is everything I expected, wanted, and more.  The cast was incredible, the music was wonderful.  This was so worth waiting for.  So glad to have it in my library.
B00AGKH45I|5.0|My all time favorite album.  I can't believe it's been 35 years.  This package has CDs, DVDS and a nice brand new vinyl copy of Rumours.  Sounds GREAT !  I have not watched the DVD yet, but will soon.  Looking forward to watching it.  Love this album, so can't go wrong here !
B003O86FMW|5.0|Twist at the end I wouldn't have expected! I am really rooting on Peeta! On to book 3 fingers crossed!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|My bestfriend has always wanted to be a photographer, so I tried this app to see if she would like it. I never really wanted to be a photographer, but once I got this app, everyone wanted to know how I got my pictures so perfect and make so many cool quotes! This app has proven itself to my friends and I popular, awesome, and can help make our pictures Picture Perfect. Get this app!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|We all enjoy it. All the kids love it and it can keep them busy for a while. Works great on my Kindle. I just wish they didn't limit you to three objectives at a time. But no real issues.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game is really fun...challenging enough but I can still get through! I just wish the full version didn't cost so much.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is going to be a big help in the store for me.  I don't add or subtract in my head when I am under pressure.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book since the first time I read it over 25 years ago.<br />I give it to all new moms as a shower gift.
0380977788|5.0|This was a great book! It's more scarey than the movie so beware for your kid's sake. The book was in good shape when I recieved it and I am satisfied with my purchase!
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I agree that this is a book about empowering already empowered women.  It shows that elite education doesn't mean you have<br />any street smarts at all.  Why are all these highly capable women so timid?  We weren't like that in the '70's and '80's when my<br />girlfriends and I were opening the first doors.  And so what if super-fabulously educated and well-connected women decide that raising human life to be independent, honorable members of society is way better than corporate advancement. Thank God many of them do. I say that as a dedicated, life-long feminist.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|These are bad guys who do bad things, but you just like them so much anyway. If you are a Sons of Anarchy fan you could relate to this as well. The difference here is the writing easily translates the ways of the Vikings as their culture rather than them just being bad guys for the sake of being bad guys. The culture creates their baseline for badness, then of course you have the characters who have mean streaks in them from there.<br /><br />The show is so well done, not what I expected from the History Channel. The sets are very raw and believable for the time period, and the writing and acting are both top notch. Vikings has joined Game of Thrones and The Borgias as my favorite shows running right now.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After all the hype, I bought this to read on my kindle. While I did not expect a literary masterpiece, I was quickly left wondering what all the hoopla was about.  The characters were very flat.  The plot was utterly ridiculous.  Even the supposedly &#34;hot&#34; parts left me lukewarm. I won't be buying books two or three.
