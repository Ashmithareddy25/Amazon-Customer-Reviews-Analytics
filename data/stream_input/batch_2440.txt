B000R7HY0K|3.0|I'm huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, but what letdown as soon I was done with this movie. It had good story with peddle-to-the-metal shockers as White Line Fever, and cool action. But the acting is ok only stand out is Kurt Russell,  and the something their no plot.It's my less Tarantino films. star *** out *****

B001NHNG64|5.0|This character is such an anti hero, hero. Drop in on his life anytime he will be in a mess. A very logical mess, you can understand exactly how he got there. As you run along beside him you are amazed at his prowess at solving complicated mysteries. He is out of the fat and into the fire so many times it leaves you breathless.  Need an action filled quick read?  Reach for Reacher.
1575666286|5.0|Eating poisons in the form of processed foods, artificial colors, flavors, etc. has to show up at some time; so eating well just makes good sense to me.  Once you are sick, this book shows you how to detox and take care of yourself, so you can heal.  I have been juicing for several months now since seeing the documentary and reading the book, and many of my dis-eases are disappearing as my body uses the nutrients to repair my body.  I feel great, and my recent tests and lab work came out like a teenager's (healthy, low numbers in blood pressure, sugar, and blood pressure.)  Not sure I agree with everything, but I take what I like and use it for better health.
1476729719|2.0|This book was very depressing.  I kept thinking that there would be some hope or a glimpse of something good in this story, but there was none. I was exhaused after reading this book. Maybe it's her writing style, but I know I will stay clear of anymore of her books. Waste of time.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I like a lot  the premise of virtually invincible foes for the hero - (spoiler alert) how do you get rid of a soul once and for all if it refuses to stay dead and insists on hijacking a body every so often? The Blood Song sure seems an excellent weapon to have against such fiendish adversaries.<br /><br />I like how the hero is put together - a tenacious core, with veins of compassion, and growing wisdom. I also like the writing style - simple, direct, flowing the story fluidly. Came across only a handful of typos (like &#34;pouring&#34; instead of &#34;poring&#34;), and a few small grammar hiccups - eminently forgivable.<br /><br />We're left with a few puzzles, like why the Seventh Order would want Vaelin dead early on - unless they somehow thought he'd unravel them altogether. Is there anything one could do to help a grief-mad widow overcome her insatiable need for vengeance and become acquainted with forgiveness, or is it inevitable that she'll join in with the One Who Waits crowd? And are there some benevolent-style Departed, or only vile, vicious, vindictive, power-hungry destructive types?<br /><br />We also get our appetite whetted for many more potential adventures - a promise for more on the Raven's Shadow legend and the Northern Reaches connection, more details on the Nameless and associated Mysteries, the story of the Queen of Fire, and (hopefully) figuring out how to reach and combat effectively the seemingly impregnable master puppeteer that runs the gang of malicious Departed.<br /><br />Overall, beautifully done, I cannot recommend this book highly enough - and I strongly suspect the sequels will be just as good if not even better.
B003UPPO2G|4.0|good listening! I don't have a lot of words to write about this product so I am just writing anything. since it is required!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Make sure you have some free time when you start to play it.  Great brain teaser as you go up in the levels.

And the price is right.
006197806X|2.0|I greatly enjoyed Delirium, despite it's tragic ending, and was looking forward to reading the sequel. I can't find the words to describe how disappointed I was in the sequel. I couldn't make it past the first five chapters, it was so monotonous and depressing. I eventually decided to give it another chance though. When I read the end, I was absolutely horrified. It was the worst ending I've read in a very long time. I most likely won't even bother with the next book.

1250012570|4.0|TO UNCOVER OR BE COVERED:<br />I know some people had a few problems with the cover of ELEANOR & PARK by Rainbow Rowell, at least before reading the book, but I don't see how one could EVER have NOT liked this cover. Loved it, even. It's simple, yes, but before I even opened the book I had a sweet intuitive idea as to what I was going to be getting myself into. The cover is somehow powerful in its simplicity, because nothing draws your attention away from the fact that this book is about those two people indicated on the cover. AND THE DRAWINGS. I love them too! Making their headsets into something that joins and creates the \\"&\\" is brilliant and says so much as well. Basically, I think the cover is effing beautiful. Even more so after finally reading this book.<br /><br />What can I say that hasn't been said? Oh, yeah, I HATED THIS BOOK... for being so awesome. Not. While I can say that it may have started out with favorite vibes and finished leaving me uneasy and a little dissatisfied (not wholly, though, which is a plus!), this book, in so many of the parts that make up the sum, is absolutely as beautifully tender and romantic as everyone says it is.<br /><br />WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS:<br />So, Eleanor, right. She's the new girl in school, and nobody but nobody is willing to roll out the welcome wagon or their extra seat on the bus, for this girl who's big, frizzy-haired, and wears all the wrong things. Except for a reluctant Park, who can't help but be embarrassed for her a tiny bit more than himself (because who wants to be seen sitting with the new Bozo?). Instantly, the two judge each other on sight, one declaring the other \\"that stupid Asian kid\\" and the other \\"a dumb redhead.\\" But something about Eleanor's silence, the way she keeps to herself and never asks of anything from him (including a conversation), the way she reads Dickinson, the way she unintrusively follows along as he reads his comics, sparks a tiny bit of SOMETHING. Friends, more than, neither could be sure of what will unfold, but all Eleanor knows is that she's found one person, even before the first word between them, she wishes she could sit with all day long.<br /><br />WHERE WE GO:<br />Star-crossed lovers? Well, maybe a little. Because it seems no one approves of even a friendship between Eleanor and Park. Not the kids at school, not Park's mom (after meeting her once), and God only KNOWS what Eleanor's mom would've said. Because at first glance, it doesn't seem that Eleanor and Park would have one thing in common, they're so different. Not just in appearance, but in attitude. But, even with all the disapproval circulating, all the difficulty of developing any sort of connection, Eleanor and Park GET each other almost instantly. The story is about them understanding that, if they're together, they're not alone, two kids who dig the weird in the 80s.<br /><br />There's this mystery of Eleanor's life from the past year and how it translates to an even worse time in her terrible home. Her stepfather is a drunken bastard, her mom is broken and too tolerant, and her little siblings don't see her the way they used to. As for Park, who has a relatively normal household, acceptance is a shortage from Park's dad, who, though in no way is a bad person, wants something from Park that doesn't align with who Park really is. On the surface, Eleanor and Park should never have bothered with each other, but from the second they share a headset listening to Park's Walkman, they realize they speak each other's language, which they both realize takes precedence over what people think.<br /><br />WHO WE ARE WITH:<br />From the minute Park gave up his prized solitude on the bus for Eleanor I knew I was going to enjoy the dust jacket off this book! And I knew I loved them both. That love grew from sympathy, understanding, and then awe at everything these two are and are together. Park is a closet weirdo, and asks questions about himself and what he wants that he's too scared to the find answers to, but just by being in Eleanor's presence, who's brave enough to be seen as different or crazy-haired or whatever, he begins to learn a little something about courage. And as confident and cool as Eleanor must seem in the face of all the teasing and bullying coming from the bus demons and their lesser minions, she's actually really insecure about her body and the way she looks. But she accepts it as it is what it is. She's still brave--that girl has endured SO MUCH--but not quite enough to love her body. She's a lonely, openly sarcastic, defiant soul and is more than a little surprised when Park seems to have some unexplained interest in her. But Park isn't interested in dishonest kind people, but someone who isn't scared to say what she thinks about anything. Someone he can debate the next issue of Watchmen with, someone he can turn on his Walkman for and swap thoughts on his music, someone who might be a little scared to hold his hand.<br /><br />THE LITTLE THINGS:<br /><br />  Every Moment of Bus Time<br />  That First Kiss<br />  Park Tells Eleanor She Doesn't Need a Nickname<br />  That First Phone Conversation<br />  Park Holds Eleanor's Hand on the Bus<br />  The \\"Sad Hobo Clown\\" Scene<br />  Park's Parents And Their Story<br />  On. The. Couch.<br /><br />The only part of ELEANOR AND PARK by Rainbow Rowell that I have mixed feelings on is the ending. Honestly, it's a good thing I didn't write my review right after and gave it almost a day to stew and process. After letting it digest a little bit more, I've decided I don't necessarily want to stab it with a fork, but it's not the ending I would've preferred. You're probably giving me that judgey face that says, \\"What? Did you want an easy happily ever after?\\" and I'd have to say only a small part of me does. The rest of me just CAN'T DIG THE ENDING completely. I didn't like what it did to each of them, and it was vaguely open-ended, which I normally hate on sight. But BECAUSE it's ELEANOR & PARK by Rainbow Rowell, it went down a little easier. But, you, my fellow reading lovers, can take away from this review the fact that it doesn't end badly at all, even from in my shoes.<br /><br />Ultimately, ELEANOR & PARK by Rainbow Rowell is a special book, with dreamily perfect writing to suit a truly mag story. A sweet and scary and beautiful one all about firsts, and that person who's your first everything... and maybe only. There's a reason why most people don't have a bad word for this book, and neither do I.d to the find answers to, but just by being in Eleanor's presence, who's brave enough to be seen as different or crazy-haired or whatever, he begins to learn a little something about courage.

0062059963|2.0|TO UNCOVER OR BE COVERED:<br />Honestly, I was a little bit worried about the cover design for THE ELITE. I guess it was the hair and how weird-shaped the model's head looked on the smaller computer image, but in person it's just as pretty and eye-catching as it's predecessor's. Maybe they're too much alike and only a little different and maybe my thoughts on THE ELITE are slipping into my cover thoughts as well.<br /><br />WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS:<br />`Kay, so remember how in THE SELECTION, there might as well be A TON of girls for our lovely, awkward prince to choose from. Now there are only five girls remaining, and our prince is having a tough, frustrating time determining the best choice as America Singer is the one causing problems. With America teetering unsteadily toward the end of THE SELECTION, it was easy to see on which end she was most likely going to fall. That decision seems to be intact but only after loads of drama, half-hearted rebel attacks, and a plot that has wavered and become riddled with tension, misunderstandings, slow-moving tactics to pique the interest of THE ELITE's reader.<br /><br />WHERE WE GO:<br />The setting of Cass's story hasn't changed since we dropped out of THE SELECTION. We're still in the glam of the palace, soaking up all that royal riches can buy, from fine food to good help, and, frankly, it gets to be a bit tedious. Though the tension grows thicker, it's like a weak sapling dying under falling snow--it struggles to make its presence known but ultimately fails--unless you're an optimist, which I'm pretending not to be for the sake of this image I'm trying to create. It's not a weak attempt on Cass's part, just a failing one.<br /><br />Same goes, if not more, for the plot. With THE SELECTION, I found it okay for Cass to slowly and teasingly introduce the rebel squad she's got working, but to do it in the sequel just made me want to roll my eyes every time the people of the palace came out of hiding and found the very ambiguous and threatening \\"WE ARE COMING.\\" I was a little spooked in THE SELECTION, like an anxious mare anticipating a storm, but after THE ELITE that mare has since found a more interesting-looking predicament, like how to reach that apple. What I'm getting at is the tease is half the fun in an introduction to a series, but one of the top reasons one waits for the sequel is to be satisfied--in answers, you perverts.<br /><br />Cass made a wrong turn, as she kept dangling that shiny new thing expecting me to give chase, only when I got a closer look I realized it was the inside of Twix wrapper.<br /><br />WHO WE ARE WITH:<br />Oh, Greek deities above on a mountain, everyone was all over the place in THE ELITE! And not in a good way. In many respects, THE ELITE showed the absolute worst sides of all the characters combined, America especially. Between all the blubbering, self-doubt, wishy-washy decision-making I wanted to smother her under all those pretty dresses her lady's maids were slaving over. In THE SELECTION, I found her uncertainty both believably practical and emotional and now I see that Cass has failed in amassing more sympathy for America because my supply ran short after the first third of the book. I didn't see America as irrational and silly, initially, but then she started doing all these THINGS until she landed in the neighborhood of emotionally afflicted stupidity and childishness. One moment she's saying how she's sorry she's hurt Aspen so much then the next she's realizing he messed up everything, one moment hates Maxon with the power of a thousand suns and the next she gets why he's done what he has. I got her insecurities, but I hated her indecisive stance, unable to leave the Selection but not sure if she should stay while countless girls ARE competing and are maybe even winning a little...<br /><br />Then, toes below Maxon gets to be a piece of work. Most times I would only find that irritating on the behalf of the FMC not so much the author's part. But I couldn't help but question the organic-ness of his small changes. Cass made me believe the Maxon that THE SELECTION showed us, and the actions of this Maxon don't coincide with the Maxon I've come to know. I want to say that that may have been the point BUT it felt forced and artificially incorporated for the sake of Second Book Tension. I didn't buy it even as I was raging at him, I didn't buy the sudden revealing of some dirty secrets he's been keeping.<br /><br />Aspen, though, needs to just go home! It doesn't even have to do with his influence on the romance, but more his input feels useless, unnecessary, and eyerollable. He's there solely to make America conflicted, and always has been, which is why I've probably been so frustrated by his character. I mean, deep down, who doesn't love a good love triangle? But as the third point, he weakens the overall shape just by existing to exist.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed by these three. And the fact that, while Cass was busy complicating matters of love with drama and angst, she didn't give nearly enough depth to characters I'd hoped to cling to by the time I finished THE ELITE.<br /><br />THE LITTLE THINGS:<br /><br />  Maxon Dancing with America<br /><br />The real deciding factor on my feelings on this book is summed up by the fact that I skimmed a little over a third of this book after the first third. And the only reason I wanted to pay full attention to that last bit was to ensure I wasn't missing anything I wanted to bask in. Because in spite of my disappointment and mild rage, I am cracked out over Maxon and America no matter how pissed I am at them.

B00CL68BK2|5.0|I have watched this move over four times. It characterizes mental illness in a pure simple to see way. My husband didn't necessarily like the raw \\"in your face\\" way of the movie but he still enjoyed it. Obviously there are bad words and some crude language but it was funny and the story was well told. The positive message it brings and way they characters come to life makes it a must see movie.
B007X16GFC|4.0|This is a good action movie, but its plot is a little old: Just another shady-but- &#34;cool&#34; character who, with the help of other shady characters, gets in a lot of trouble and miraculously escapes from it all, coming out having the world by the tail.

B005GRTNVE|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD of Il Divo in concert live in London.  The audio and video are fine to me, so I do not understand why there would be any negative reviews about that, and the song selection in my opinion is fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the concert from beginning to end.  I also have the DVD of Il Divo Live in Barcelona.  I really enjoy that DVD too.  The stage for the Barcelona concert goes out into the audience, so the guys were able to move around on stage more than the concert at the London Coliseum.  The stage at the Colesium does not go into the audience, so the guys were more limited as far as their movement on stage and interaction with the audience.  The audience at the Colesium is about 20 feet away whereas the guys could touch the hands of the audience in Barcelona.  The coliseum looks beautiful though, and I enjoyed the sights as I watched Il Divo perform in this beautiful place.  This DVD also has a few humorous moments that make me laugh.  The Colesium, music/orchestra, vocals, and the bonus content at the end of the DVD are great.  Part of the bonus content at the end are the guys discussing the songs on their Wicked Game CD track by track.  As they discuss each song, the song being discussed plays in the background.  Beautiful! -  I have ordered the Wicked Game CD now too!  Yay Me!!

With this novel Clancy is getting back on track with the type of novel that made him so different. It is not the quality of The Hunt for Red October, but it is a major step back in that direction.

1451695195|4.0|On one hand this is a difficult review to write, and on the other it's very easy. I loved this book because there were many times I was moved to tears and felt a resonance to things that have happened in my life (though I'm not a NDE survivor, I am paramedic and have witnessed strange and wondrous things in my career). Many of the truths and revelations Dr. Alexander reached I've felt were true for years. Perhaps it's pleasant to have someone else write out things that I'd like to be true, things of faith that no one can prove. So to read aspects of his journey and revelations hit home for me.<br /><br />However, as a medical professional, I agree with others that he doesn't add the proof of his lack of neocortax activity, only asserts that his was non-functioning during his coma. I would like to accept this at face value by his writing alone, but it would be better to see literature on his actual medical condition. If, in fact, his deep brain functions were gone it adds more credence to his journey. Assuming current medical science can record all of the brain's activity in a deep coma state. There's also the questionable possibility of his awakening and experiencing this during his 'reboot'. Something he doesn't fully accept as possible. My question is- where does the human brain end and God begin? Could the truth be both?<br /><br />Faith is such precisely because it is unprovable by science... at least for now.<br /><br />I guess I like to resolve my scientific mind and my spiritual mind through the first law of thermodynamics or the conservation of energy stating that 'energy can neither be created or destroyed' only transformed.<br /><br />Assuming the human soul is a form of energy separate from the physical body, (and we do know the body is a bio/chemical/electrical machine) then there must be someplace for it to go after the body dies. Because energy can only be transformed. Then there must be something more after physical death.<br /><br />And that doesn't take into account all the wonderfully strange things I've personally experienced in my life.<br /><br />That's my scientific view. My faith is much stronger.take into account all the wonderfully strange things I've personally experienced in my life.<br /><br />That's my scientific view. My faith is much stronger.

B008AUGEFC|4.0|This was an interesting book, but I've really been struggling with how to describe it. I've stopped and started this blog post several times because I just wasn't sure how to approach it. I'm still not quite sure how to approach, so if you get frustrated by how vague this post is, I apologize in advance. But here it goes.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas focuses on six characters in six different times. Each character has their own segment in the book, but there are little references that tie each character's stories together. There were just enough hints and references to allow the reader to tie the story together, but it doesn't get too obvious. Mitchell assumes the reader is smart enough to piece it together, which I appreciated.<br /><br />The basic theme of this book is finding your place in the world. There are references to technology and corporations bringing about the downfall of modern society. The final theme was that love can overcome. Ugh, this is so vague, but this book defies a quick re-cap. Just trust me - it's a good one.<br /><br />In a nutshell: It took me a bit to get into this book, but once I did, I really liked it. Three and a half stars.<br /><br />Note: I watched the movie right after I finished the book and no surprise, it was not nearly as good. The movie dropped too many details from the book and went a little too heavy on other details. So, skip the movie, but read the book.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I was expecting a movie about love and football, but it was not like that at all. It is about a relationship between two individuals with intense personalities and touches upon the issues dealt with by people with mental health issues.

0446693804|5.0|\\"There are moments when I wish I could roll back the clock and take all the sadness away, but I have the feeling that if I did, the joy would be gone as well.\\"<br /><br />I watched A Walk to Remember back in 2002, I think that was when the movie came out. I loved it the first, second, third, fourth, (well you get the picture) time that I watched it. It was such a moving story, and it was deeply tragic. I was a bit spectical to read the book because a lot of my friends were not fond of Sparks' writing, still, I have a kindle and decided that getting a sample wouldn't hurt. Turns out, it was the best decision that I made all week.<br /><br />The language is very simple and easy to read. Landon, talks like any other high school senior. He is one of those conflicted characters who knows right from wrong, but is sometimes blinded by peer pressure. This is an aspect I can relate to, as I remember high school being more about what people expect of you rather than discovering yourself. Kids don't like those who are different from them, and they will find a way to make those outsiders know it.<br /><br />Jamie's character is absolutely charming, and I wished I could have met someone like her back in high school. She is a different kind of nice, as in she doesn't need recognition for her good deeds. A lot of kids will go out of their way to do nice things for others, but they make sure that their deed doesn't go unnoticed. Jamie is nothing like that, she does the right thing simply because it is the right thing to do. She doesn't have a negative thought about anyone, and her kindness knows no limits. I know that like Landon, I would definitely be changed by  meeting her as well. There is something about her sweet and ever giving essences that touches me, even though she is a character trapped in this story.<br /><br />This isn't your typical love story where the male and female meet and instantly fall in love, and run into the sunset together. This is a story about struggle,loss, finding and losing yourself, realizing that life is never a guarantee, and learning how to be best version of yourself. It is also learning and accepting that although tragic events will occur in our lives, those events do have a silver lining-they HIGHLIGHT all the blessings that we have neglected in the past.<br /><br />You know those stories that continue to touch you even after you finish reading the last page? Well, A Walk to Remember is one of them.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|I see so many great reviews about this book.  I was not a big fan, it was not that engaging to me.  Neat original idea, lots of nerve to take the topic on, but I did not find the execution to be that satisfying.  I know I will be drummed out of the readers club for this one.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Hard film to watch however, I recommend this to everyone because it is necessary to see this film. You'll become speechless watching it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This movie was beautiful. I could have done without one particular scene at the Inn, but the rest of the movie completely makes up for it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is awesome. its like an iron man version of temple run, except it has better graphics and has a story line.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Its a nice change from Bejeweled.<br /><br />my daughter has gotten me hooked on this game. Its a nice change from bejeweled.

1452110581|5.0|I received this book and started reading it, then couldn't put it down. By the time I was done, my sides were aching. Some of the poems are mildly amusing, but some of them are hilarious. All are well-written and capture the personality of a cat. It would be a superb gift for anyone who owns and loves cats.
B005HSL626|5.0|like this game. i like the settings and the bonus points for slicing 3 or more fruit at once. good game
B001N26GFM|5.0|Hard film to watch however, I recommend this to everyone because it is necessary to see this film. You'll become speechless watching it.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I give it 5 stars by treating it as a book that was made into a movie.  It sticks with the book to a point , but if you think of it as a movie not the book it's great.  As for the negative reviews because it only half of the story.  Well I much rather them tell the whole story then just turn it into crap, in order to make it fit in one two and a half hour story.  It's what can be expected.  Now if you don't wish to buy 2 movies then just rent it what is 4.00 USD, it's well worth the time.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Even though you try, you won't be able to hold back the tears. The acting of the three main characters was awesome.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I feel like part of the story now No it did not drop off at all, cannot wait to see what happens next, Che
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Awesome! Love it! I recommend this to everyone because it is awesome! It is a very cool item to have!
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This show is both intriguing and thrilling to watch. It has deep character development and Tatiana does a great job at showcasing her acting abilities, from playing a punk street drifter to a soccer mom to a PhD graduate student. Although boasted as a Sci-Fi show I would say this is more of a crime drama with some science involved, all in all its a must watch.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Book was slow at first, hard to stick with. However, once I got beyond the first few chapters, I felt compelled to continue.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Wow I cannot put it down, a real page turner. I love all the history and the plot thickens, Che
B000002V07|5.0|Awesome! Love it! I recommend this to everyone because it is awesome! It is a very cool item to have!
B00AG51V8E|4.0|Perhaps all the negative reviews are based on the fact that a cast with so many big names promises a better story will be told than what \\"Cold Light of Day\\" delivers. However, based on whether or not i was entertained for 90 minutes, I give it four stars. The scenery is great, the action comes along fast enough to prevent long lulls in story telling, and the good guy wins in the end. I wish the car chase had been a little punchier, but I'm satisfied that i got my money's worth at $5.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love this sound tract and also the TV series. The talent is amazing and I can not wait until Volume 2 comes out!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Spent lots of time matching jewels since I have signed up!  Great Way to make time pass!  I love Jewels Star

B002SSUQFG|4.0|overall a good watch with plenty of features. I was looking for a good night watch with luminescent dials.. I found that in this watch.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|Would highly recommend this movie as it is a realistic truth about history and the powerful Catholic church.  Not at all what I expected.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|If you like a mystery thriller with a little sci-fi, you will just love this series.  Be sure you start from the beginning as you need to understand exactly what is going on --- very very interesting concept.
B00003XACV|5.0|Awesome! Love it! I recommend this to everyone because it is awesome! It is a very cool item to have!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It's a lesson of life that people should be exposed to that give it a chance with an open heart. I would have enjoyed the film a whole lot more without the character (actor) whom also played Borat. Don't get his moronic humor. With him in this film I drop it to a four 1/2. stars.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Don't like this app anymore since the big update. Too many clicks to see basic stuff. I will only keep this as a back up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very emotional and sci-fi-y. A great book if you do not like your life because of all your losses. Brought tears to my eyes.
0553801473|1.0|I can not possibly say anything new regarding the meandering and sell-out content of this book - MOST disappointing.  In fact, couldn't force myself to finsih it.  And I will read anything (or as it turnd out, just about anything).
B003KVKQB4|4.0|This book makes me literally sick to my stomach.  It shows a truth about the greed of Americans and Europeans.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I won't go into a detailed review of this book, because I am no good at that sort of thing, but can I just say that this book was a fantastic joy to read! It is such engaging sci-fi and is very original and just keeps whacking you with cliffhanger chapters so you end up staying up too late reading \\"just one more chapter\\", and then you are late to work the next day and when you finally roll into the office you are all like \\"Oh man, there was this giraffe from the zoo that got loose and caused an semi to jack-knife on the highway, and spill it's whole shipment of avocados, which caused a swarm of birds and guacamole lovers to decent upon the highway and it really backed up traffic, and that's why I am late\\".<br /><br />So download this book and read it and start making up excuses for why you are so late to work.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|In my opinion, Denzel Washington ages like a fine wine. And the roles he chooses to play at this stage of his career are projects with so much depth beneath the surface. Flight takes us on a ride that turns out to be so much more than the film's trailer. The pairing of Washington and Don Cheadle once again, alone, is worth the price of admission to this well acted character study. And John Goodman is so versatile that he is well placed in any excellent film... and usally is. My Denzel DVD collection is growing, and there's not a rotten tomato in the bunch.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is just plain fun. I have really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who just enjoys a quick little game.
B009IUH1N2|3.0|i thought it was ok, my grandson played it a little but tired of it very quickly. he likes the bear chase better

B0092B125A|3.0|I liked the material but I find it very hard to use in a kindle format.,  I would like more use of the book and may buy it in book form.  Sort of a waste of money in the kindle for me, though it did have some good ideas.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Absolutely love this game.  Very addictive, beautiful graphics on my kindle. I use the touch screen &#34;A&#34; controls, could not get the hang of &#34;tilt&#34; controls.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Please please please put this on free app of the day. I played it on friends kindle and thought it was awesome. The only problem is that I'm broke. So could you please consider. Also all the other gameloft games are awesome like nova 3, six guns,dark night. You get the idea.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|With the movie out, I am sorry to say, the book came in a second place.  Visuals were strong in the movie but lacking a bit in the book, with a weak story and character development.  Great for a young reader, who is good for the romance side of the story.
1449410243|5.0|5 Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth was what first got me into the oatmeal, and I was eager to purchase his second work when I heard about it. Needless to say, it didn't disappoint.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I know everyone feels a bit down after reading a good book. But I felt after all the characters had been thru that the author did not know how to wrap it up. I thought the ending was a bit contrived and abrupt. But do not let that stop you from reading the book, it is very engaging.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Yea, the review title says it all. If you want to buy it, go for it. If not, Don't. Your choice.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|I guess I'm not sure what I was expecting.  I kept hearing these incredible reviews but it just wasn't .... something.  I really can't put a finger on it.  Yes Downey is Tony Stark for sure.  And the Skydiving sequence is nothing short of incredible.  But the rest of it is kinda quirky.  And it's filled with recycled stuff.  The villain really isn't original, The whole terrorist plot thing gets really tiring and it's pretty predictable.  Here we are blowing up Air Force One again, with the President in peril, and blah, blah, blah.  If it wasn't for Downey's one liners it would have been boring.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Yea, the review title says it all. If you want to buy it, go for it. If not, Don't. Your choice.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I enjoyed the history of the American Civil War as shown in the movie and its exposure of what President Lincoln went through to<br />stop slavery in the US and the very terrible...very high.... cost in terms of lives in order to free the colored people...the cost to the American people itself.... to Lincoln's own family and in the end the cost to his own life ! So I hope the colored people in the US today would appreciate what it took to emancipate them.... instead of taking it for granted.... demanding, demanding and yet demanding for equality ! God does not create everybody equal ! One has to fight and earn it !

030758836X|5.0|This was the third of Flynn's books that I read.  It definitely kept me guessing!  It is well written from different perspectives.  I highly recommend this book, as well as her previous two.
3464207072|5.0|Note: this whole book is in German.  I know it's a German learning book, and I was taking classes at Goethe-Institut.  This was the required text.  If you don't know German, and don't have instruction, this is not the book for you as it assumes as you go that either someone is explaining some of the text or that you have fundamental German understanding.<br /><br />That said, once you do have those things this book is excellent.  Sehr Gut!
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|Good music and I love it has the small booklet to check all singer and the meaning of the song. I use it to do Yoga and sleep time. My spirit come back once I listen these songs.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is a good read. I have not seen the movie, I wanted to experience the book first. It is about heartache, happiness, struggling to live again after lose. Quick did a great job. I never got board or frustrated even once wanting to put the book down. I read A LOT of books and I get tired of the love romance books at times. This one is  not like that. Great read.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|My wife and I loved Season 1.  At this point we are so into the story we have to stop ourselves from watching back to back episodes.  I think of it as a mix of Braveheart and Calafornication.
B00065MDRW|4.0|Well, it is.<br />It's got a dirty great highpoint at both ends and it sags in the middle. Now, before you all start complaining, that doesn't mean the saggy bits are that bad, just that the end bits are so high.<br />Not being of an age to remember the release of ItCotCK - I was more into Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky Mick and Titch - I can't imagine how 21st Century Schizoid Man could have sounded to people back then. Heck, even if it was the only KC track ever committed to tape it would still be talked of in hushed reverential tones. Progressive Rock was born, defined, encapsulated, personified, crystallised there and then. So why does it get covered by so many dodgy METAL bands?<br />At the other end of the bridge we get ItCotCK itself, a silky, lush field of mighty MELLOTRONIC goodness. Bliss.<br /><br />And the middle? Well, it's good to relax to in the bath with Mellotronoc Bath salts.<br /><br />So, If you want a Sandwich made of the finest bread with a not so thrilling filling BUY! Just relax in the bath between mouthfulls.<br /><br />Oh, the wife says BUY! because Greg Lake was so HUNKY back then and what golden tonsils. Women, aren't they shallow?
B004BSFC46|3.0|Well, I got these thinking she'd love them but, when I put them on her arm, she just looked at them & started reaching for something else.
B00BC0JI6O|4.0|Now, I'm not the biggest fan of Spock's Beard about, being an occasional dipper into their facial hair. But, having bought a ticket to go see them, I thought I'd better acquaint msyelf with the latest piece of their oeuvre, and well, as sure as eggs is eggs, it's not too shabby!<br />Whilst I wouldn't say there are any stand out tracks on the album, there's nothing on there that merits skipping. I must admit that I do love the Gentle Giant vocal stylings of Afterthoughts and was most impressed that they pulled it off - ooohhhhhhhhhh, Matron! - live.<br /><br />So if you want a good slice of proggishness that's not too hard a listen BUY!
4898153194|5.0|Ever since I saw the images via BuzzFeed, I fell in love and had to own it.  The book is small, but full of lovely and high quality photographs.  A great buy and a great gift!  Fast shipping and beautifully wrapped.

0380725398|4.0|In this atmospheric, sinister tale, the main character, Mary, must confront the evil doings of her Uncle-in-Law Joss and find a way to bring him to justice while also sparing her downtrodden, nervous Aunt Patience.  The story builds slowly as more and more is revealed of Jamaica Inn and Joss's activities.  When you think it can't get worse, things definitely get worse.  This is such a wonderfully dark story with glimpses of light in Mary's strength of character.  Mary stands up for herself and has a very determined personality, but she is a little naive and jumps to a few conclusions very easily.  Although there is romance in this story it moves very quickly and doesn't seemed based on a true connection.  And it's not even very romantic since the object of Mary's affection is a little suspicious himself, and in one scene of the novel leaves Mary stranded without a word or money in a town at night.<br /><br />Though the story is very engaging, there were issues I had personally with the very misogynistic aspect of the story.  Even though Mary is the strongest character she proves largely ineffective in what she is trying to accomplish (the men accomplish it of course), and when she visits the man she comes to love (her very first visit!), he tells her to cook dinner for him, but first she cleans his kitchen because she can't cook in that pigsty.  Seriously.  Mary makes claims that she would rather be a man and live and work alone, but she disappointingly succumbs to feminine weakness more than once.  The other female characters in this story are all pretty weak as well, especially feeble, doting Aunt Patience.  It seems to me that this story shows how terrible the influence of a man can be.<br /><br />Yet even after that rather depressing aspect to this story, I think it is a very entertaining read, with a mystery that sort of sneaks up on the reader, because it wasn't every clear that there was even a mystery brewing in the tale.  The writing is top notch, and illustrates the stark beauty of Jamaica Inn's lonely surroundings very well.  It paints a picture thoroughly and allows the reader to delve into Mary's mind completely.  It's an overwrought, daring and captivating read.trates the stark beauty of Jamaica Inn's lonely surroundings very well.

B008ALAHA4|5.0|I bouught this adapter because our friends from Apple changed the magsafe format in the latest MacBook Air (early 2013) and it happens I had a power cord from my MacBook Pro and wanted to use it as a backup.<br />It works great, the magnets are strong enough to hold the cable and its like it is part of the laptop.<br />Highly Recomended!!

Needless to say was I was very impressed with the album and now I just about own all of the WS albums except for a few very hard to find ones.

B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I didn't know what I was thinking when I downloaded this.  I don't really want to play against my Facebook friends....I don't play any of their reindeer games when they ask me to play so it wouldn't be fair to ask them to do something that I am not willing to do.  For some reason I had it in my head that I would just play and it would show me scores from various strangers that I had to beat.  And so I haven't played it at all.  Sorry.

B003MVJG8Q|1.0|I ordered this to use, along with an upgraded GoFlex Desk, on my media center PC. I chose this one because it was supposed to have BOTH a full size, and a low profile bracket included. When it arrived, not only is there no bracket, there is also no mention of the bracket on the box, or on this page anymore. I'm really having a bad year for ordering from Amazon. I guess I'll have to return this as well as the GoFlex adapter that didn't actually include the adapter.

B000SEHJGQ|2.0|I don't mind gritty, and I don't expect a happy ending.  I think that I just don't get this author, and that's okay.  I guess I expect my raunchy reading to be delivered in a more clever manner, I don't like getting slapped repeatedly in the face with it.  There are missing parts of text and a few obvious typos too; if you are already disgusted with a plot line that doesn't seem to go anywhere, it's a problem.  I give it 3 stars for actual content and 1 star for editing which averages out to 2 stars.  If you read the book you'll realize the author was used to a 2 star life, lol.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 7 year old son loves this game; it's challenging and you have to think about how to solve the puzzle.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I have never seen a movie so well done as was sunshine. This is a movie to keep in your collection as something to watch once in a while. It was well done adn the acting was great. The actors really took their time learning about the science in the movie. DUring scenes of emergency, they all seemed to be part of a real crew.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 6 year old daughter and 3 year old son love this game. My 7 year old son, not so much.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I kept reading. The best tribute I can give a book is that I kept reading it and wanted to find out what would happen. This is \\"Defending Jacob\\". Intriguing...
1400069289|5.0|This book is completely outside of my normal genres. I used an audible credit I had, and then waited three months before starting it. Now, I haven't listened to the radio in my car in 6 days. This book is so insightful. I cannot wait to being using the information in both my personal and professional life. I am now recommending it to everyone I know who wants to be successful at home or in their career.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|wonderful acting by the cast and did a great job brining this time in history to life in a movie
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a most interesting if somewhat sad story. So well written that I had to read the entire story (not so long) in one sitting. I had no idea that Tesla was so involved in radio and I teach Avionics which have become the new frontier for communication between man and machine. Well done mate. A great yarn and highly recommended.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|HSE is addictive. Every time I try to put it away for any significant amount of time, it keeps calling me back. Easy to learn, but not easy to master at the higher levels. Out of pocket spending is not required to enjoy this very entertaining game.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great, very fun and might be addicting. Only problem is playing on Kindle means the updates take a while to be approved by Amazon, so you don't get access to new rooms that are available  to other players on  other  platforms...like computers, other tablets and cell phones. If you get addicted, which is highly likely, this delay might drive you crazy....but just know it isn't a BB issue, but the Amazon approval of a new update  that is causing the delay.
0140282033|5.0|Very entertaining and full of surprises.  Nice reading. The descriptions of the sweets and the characters were well written. I would read other works from this author
B00APKIN1I|4.0|Great to see how music production is achieved/produced by the authorities in the field.  Proves that talent is the main ingredient in a successful music career.
030758836X|4.0|It started off a little slow but later in the book it was better. I didn't like the ending. I would suggest this book to my friends.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Loved the movie, and loved the music. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. My wife and I never seem to tire of listening to it.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|This is a nice app that fills the one gap I've had with my Android tablet--not being able to access my applications that are not available on my mobile devices.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so amazing it makes me cry these horses look so real get this app for free<br />SO GET THIS APP TODAY
0307352153|5.0|This book gives the best explanation of what it is to be an introvert and how to cope with living in a noisy and extroverted world. It opened my eyes to why I feel the way I do and how the way I think/am differs from extroverts. I think it was beneficial for me to realize that being an introvert can be a good thing, and I think it would help many extroverts to better understand those of us who are quieter.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I ever played and I'm so happy that this month is Japan... I've always wanted to go there! I cant wait to see what comes on next month I hope its Italy. As I said one of the best games ever! I wish all of the games people make were this fun!
B008VBYN80|4.0|i like it... only tiny problem, the avatars that they let you choose from are weird looking and their are so few.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love courtroom drama and this book has plenty of it. I couldn't<br /> put it down.  I will definitely be reading this author again. I would highly recommend this book.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|This is Coldplay. ¿¿¿ Do they really need me to tell anyone that there music is...well beyond DMB? Love Hard.
B0002IQNAG|1.0|ill never understand it. I waited a long time to see it. Love zombie films. The first 25 minutes is incoherent, kiddie acting, horrible blocking, just awful. I turned it off twice. Then gave it a go again after they fly out in the helicopter...its gets a bit better. But the zombies are horrible, the make up so awful, it reminds me of my high school plays, its such a bad awful movie. The Romero lemmings, not unlike their lemming counterparts of the lapping Coen Brother fanatics, would lick up excrement dished out on Tiffany, if Romero did it. 28 days later awesome. The newer version of this was decent, the first two seasons of Walking Dead, awesome. Depth, coherent dialog and brilliant directing. Romero is as about as talented as Eddie Furlong is a singer
B0041QSZJM|4.0|I originally downloaded one of this band's songs as a Starbuck's freebee. I was impressed upon download and purchased the entire album. All the songs are well done, just a bit of spice yet classy.
B000W94FE6|3.0|The concept of flow is widely known these days, but on a superficial level. So what can the original book teach us? Flow is defined here as a state when you're &#34;so involved in activity that nothing else matters&#34;, no surprises, but it is presented in a greater context, as a way to achieve happiness.<br /><br />We're told that &#34;psychic entropy&#34; (or lack of control over conciseness, or simply random thoughts), is the thing that prevents happiness. Flow, on the other hand, is &#34;optimal experience&#34;, the reverse of psychic entropy. Actually, this scale from psychic entropy to flow *is* the measure of happiness. Then, the book gives some conditions for achieving flow -- basically finding tasks that are challenging enough, but not too much, together with unambiguous and fast feedback (I found that part somewhat vague). And there's a lot of examples of flow experiences. Everything can become flow, if challenges are sought and overcome. Every chapter fits into a solid book structure.<br /><br />But it's not clear the structure makes sense. Yes, being engaged in activity at proper challenge level can be very rewarding. Is it an answer for everything? Is unhappiness indeed the same as psychic entropy? Maybe if one cannot concentrate on anything at all, yes, but hardly in all cases. Is suppressing distressing thoughts by finding a random engaging experience the best approach? No matter what that experience is? True, the book does mention that some flow experiences are not necessary good, but then goes on giving a lot of examples of flow, regardless of their value. If I'm constantly bothered by a bunch of unresolved problems, would it be wise to go and find some flow experience, to suppress the thoughts about these problems? Maybe find flow in washing dishes? Even if I manage to get very very engaged in that, will I feel a slightest bit better afterwards?<br /><br />The book was originally published in 1990, and it shows. I found no mention of Daniel Kahneman' concept of experiencing self and remembering self, which means that no matter how pleasurable flow might be in the moment, it is only one part of the story (see &#34;Thinking, Fast and Slow&#34;). There's no mention of Daniel Gilbert, who claims that people mostly stay at their baseline happiness level, and so expending great effort to become happier is probably a mistake (see &#34;Stumbling on Happiness&#34;). Instead, we find some favorable mentions of Mr. Freud, for the first time in all the books I read.<br /><br />Flow is probably an important part of good life experience, and this book is important in giving examples of flow. But equating flow with happiness is very controversial, and too much of the book is based on that equality.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Highly recommend this series of movies. There is no lacking from movie to movie.  They keep getting better.  All four are great.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This album was unlike anything they have produced and unlike anything I would have expected, but it is genius. This album is amazing. It's a fun album yet raw sounding and with meaningful lyrics. Paramore has come along way and this album marks the beginning of a new style (perfection).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very addicting when you first start playing it and more challenging afterwards. You begin to get friends to determine yourself to best thyroid sour and it makes you play that much more.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I recommended it to everyone at work today. Not only moving , but also funny!
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Everything is good and in good working order. Its just weird because there is no menu selection on any of the blu ray discs and therefore no special features.  Other than that its fine.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love this app... I can take &amp; edit a photo directly in it, or I can edit from other photos that  I already have. Super easy to use and simple to quickly edit and share photos. I own a kindle fire HD and it works perfectly with it!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Nearly ever attempt to update and reboot the Holmes story fails. This one is completely modern and credible -- and captivating. The writing and acting are excellent. The &#34;mysteries&#34; are completely irrelevant to the series' success. The characters could be getting to the bottom of a typo in the phone book, and I'd still want to watch.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|As a rule, I only do straight fact product reviews. I don't review books or video because that is the \\"Toppers\\" territory. But I just had to speak up on this movie, Guilt Trip. My wife wanted to watch this, I thought to myself, 'chick flick! Oh great...But chemistry between the actors had me in a very short time drawn in and the Son and Mother relationship was so believable. Rogan is best known for his quick witted raunchy humor and his fluent use of profanity. But in this role I don't believe he cursed ONE time because his mother (Barbra Streisand) does not allow it. Streisand always plays her roles to perfection, but Rogans portrayal of the somewhat bumbling nerdy chemist guy whom obviously loves his mother but (like most of us with loving but over protective parents) can hardly stand being around her good intentioned nagging, was right on the spot! Rogans complete identity transformation for this movie is fantastic. And when it was over l had the strongest urge to go and call MY mother! The \\"Top Reviewers\\" argue that a review should not be about opinion, but your know what, I really dug this flick! Normally, I myself do not go for these kind of 'lovey feely good' movies but I really enjoyed it...I would recommend this movie to everybody...Guys if you have to watch a Chick Flick with your gal to make up for her having to sit through endless MMA matches, get this one!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great graphics, along with a good storyline, and achievable forward  progress make for a very good game. Have a hard time putting it down.
0553062182|5.0|After years of depression, medications and counceling, reading this book has been the first time I have ever heard anyone else actually acknowledge and explain me - and the way I am.  I feel validated.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Good triumphs over ills and adversity.  Very entertaining, if you are drawn to animation.  It is a safe movie for the entire family.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I am very happy I made this purchase and can recommend it. My only comment that could be taken as negative is that when I arrange it so it is a stand for reading so I don't have to hold it, if I move much at all, it does not hold the setting and I have to do it again. It is very nice if you need to take it along with you while in the car, doctor's appointments, any other types of waiting like that. Looks nice etc. Thanks.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|I have been a Doors fan for a long time.  Unfortunately, I had no idea that The Doors had been releasing live matierial from years ago (thanks kids for killing record stores!), but I saw this album (amongst others).<br /><br />Wow!  The Doors were a great band and this shows why.  From 1970, this album has great energy and excellent sound.  The sound of the recording is awesome, and it surely feels as though you are in the audience, and unlike live recordings from other albums (Doors and non-Doors), you cannot tell the date era of the concert as digital technology has really allowed for things to be cleaned up with enough effort.  The nice thing is that Morrison seems to go different places (especially on the great \\"When the Music's Over\\" and the band follows during this concert.  Unlike the studio recordings, a new listener gets a great experience in being able to find a new treasure in these live recordings. Of the ones I have heard, this seems to be a very good night and is a good bookend to the Doors In Concert double CD, which this was supposed to play a part in but was culled.  Too bad then, great news now!<br /><br />Well worth purchasing while you dig your treasures there.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|good game. but you do need to be careful about the in game purchases. it is very tempting to buy.
B00004YA66|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE.<br />IF YOU LOVE DENNIS QUAID, OR JOHN CAVIEZEL, THIS HEART WARMING STORY WILL PLEASE YOU.<br />CONTENT IS G RATED AND A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE FOR HOLIDAYS.
1609611543|5.0|I tell everyone I know to read this book...especially when they look at me strange for asking about gluten everywhere I go.  This book completely changed the way I look at bread.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this book. Great developed characters. The story line was so believable and well thought out. I would read other books by this author.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Love the movie, hope Daniel Craig can continue to turn out more. The ending was a nice way to conclude Judy Dench's  role as a Bond girl.
B00797MB0O|5.0|Theron is a friggin' genius and never fails to draw me in deep into her characters.  I hadn't intended to write a review, but I saw this advertised as a comedy and thought, who is smoking what to call this a comedy or even a dark comedy.  It's NOT a comedy AT ALL.... unless you are severely and seriously twisted in some horrific and never before seen way.  I think some of the bad reviews are because people got the wrong idea about what kind of movie this is.  It's edgy and gut wrenching. Is that a category?  Call it drama for chrissakes.
1594203334|5.0|Defensive much?<br /><br />I'm 7 months into my first pregnancy but have been a nanny for 7 years and helped to raise my younger siblings. Of all the baby books I have read, this one is most aligned with how I approach child rearing. Instilling a sense of independence, freedom, and personal responsibility within a strong, flexible framework and not allowing the children to dictate the flow and mood of a home, but rather contribute to it and be a part of it.<br /><br />There are certainly Parisian ways of doing things that I will be leaving by the wayside. I'm not interested in their love of epidurals and lack of love for breastfeeding and I also have enough trust in my partner's intelligence and ability to learn that if I feel he is not contributing to his fair share of the work I'm not going to simply shrug it off as some kind of excused gender norm. My partner is not a Frenchmen and he will not be excused as one.<br /><br />What I really love about this book, as opposed to all the other baby books I've read, is that this one makes me feel empowered and makes me feel like things are absolutely doable without it being some huge grandiose effort in life. Other books have left me completely anxiety ridden with even more things to add to my worry list. They have made me feel like fit throwing, finicky eating, non sleeping little people are inevitable. I suppose for me, it's like my mindset going into child birth: I don't know what the experience is really going to entail, but as I approach it and am going into it I tell myself I can do this, my body was made to do this, I am fully capable and strong, as opposed to this is going to be terrifying and excruciating and I only hope I can do this.<br /><br />All in all I guess the reason the 1 & 2 star reviews of this book crack me up the most is because their defensiveness warped the real tone & message of this book. As in all things in life, take the bits you like and that work for you and leave the rest behind. If you aretaking something super personally and feeling attacked then that speaks more about you than it does the author...
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I am going to buy this! we were pleasantly surprised and will recommend to my friends and family.<br />Anthony Hopkins was magnificent.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Lots of fun. Always a new game to play.  Always ready to play.  can't wait to get back to playing.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|In the middle of so many computer animated movies, it good to see one with an excellent storyline and cast.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a fun game but ever since yesterday it wont download and when it gets almost done downloading it says &quot;connection content lost can not complete download&quot; its making me mad
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Refreshing singer..just easy music...this girl has talent.  Would buy more of her CD'S and on top of this she can act as well!!!
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Love Walk Off the Earth.  This is a great CD!  Not much else to review. The space in the review section requires ten or more words.  If you like their music this is a good one.  It arrived in perfect condition.
B0090SI460|5.0|Kids and adults will enjoy watching it. It might be scary for some younger kids. The DVD and Bly ray quality is really good
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love love love this book! Maybe even more than the first one,...maybe...  more story I think to this one than the first, still reeling about it,
B006R1T40I|5.0|Best work ever. She just gets better with each endeavor. Really enjoying this CD. Bonnie can sing for me any day of the week!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is very handy and right at my finger tips.  nice and big and easy to read.  has exactly what we need
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|The only reason that I will not put 5 stars is because this should be released in bluray and not only in DVD. Besides that, this is a must have for any Maiden fan!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is amazing but its not the best as far as Gameloft game go.  I took a star of for the amount of memory this game takes up.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Sat for a whole day to watch complete series. Enjoyed it as much as years ago. Great actors and script.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is phenomenal. I thought it was impossible to for the series to get better but i was wrong. His writing style is amazing. If you are looking for a longer more satisfying book, get this one.
B0046RE5I6|4.0|As an avid reader of Poirot novels, I have to say that this is one of my least favorite: The book is rather slow building, and we don't see a lot of Poirot until at least the 2nd half of the book. Furthermore, the characters are not so intriguing or enticing, compared to characters of typical Poirot novel. I would have wish for more humour.. and more of Poirot. The denouement is also rather disappointing (rare for Christie), as Poirot is here very understated and ... well that is enough for this review as I don't want to put any spoilers! Having said that, it is worth to mention that this is an inferior book by A.CHRISTIE standards, which means that it is still HEAD AND SHOULDER above your typical current mistery novel (plot complexity and surprise effect at the end are still there, and you still get a bit of typical Christies and Poirot humour and special touch).<br />NOTE: this book was adapted in the Suchet TV serie of Poirot: in the TV serie there is an added part in the end, which is NOT in the book, and which is actually an intersting addition (.. again I don't want to spoil , so I leave my comment as that).
B0031Y4A94|5.0|very nice fast and perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />i love the poster inside too, it was unexpective and very nice touch!<br />good buy!
0671449028|5.0|This is short enough to read even if you're really wanting to hurry and get your child to sleep.  And it is not dull in the least.  I actually love this book as much as my 3-year old does.  We love to observe the dog and rabbit mixing up their pajamas, and then to see on the next page that they must have figured it out.  Sandra Boynton is a well-known and well-loved name in our house!
B000Q7ZJK8|3.0|i recive it in a bad condition whith some sratches i the cover but the disc was fine, also it have the corner &#34;dobladas&#34; i dont really like that
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I enjoyed this story of 2 people, both of whom have psychiatric problems. Not sure if it is a best picture nominee but it is a pleasant diversion. It even has a bit of \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" at the end. The extras on the DVD have an interesting story about the author and bipolar disease.
B008BGNMZU|3.0|I saw them at southern ct Lyman center<br />Saturday night and I liked them with<br />Larry Carlton better. Group not the same.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i enjoy playing this game more than temple run because it has good graphics but is basicly the same concept although i  get bored playing it because there isnt enough interest plus the characters are way too trashy! editing the characters and adding excitement will make this game better.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Love love the show. Aliciai Florrick is awesome and this just makes the law seem so wrong and right at the same time.
B002C949KE|5.0|This book reminds of Freaconomics. Both of them are fantastic.<br />I learnt many tricks reading Predictably Irrational that are helping me with daily decisions, specially when I am about to do someting stupid.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|This is an addictive game that was surprisingly fun. Just started having problems with the game crashing on the second set of levels though, or I would have given a higher rating.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|A nice look into what it takes to become the best at something. Also full of anecdotes, recipes, and advice to better your running. A great read for anyone who is trying to improve their running and experiment with their diet in the process.
B00CHILW64|4.0|I was not able to see this in the theater, so I rented it.  The acting was great, I love Ewen Mcgregor.  All the acting is great, I had to hide my eyes at some of groosome bloody scenes.  For that reason this is probably not for the kids, there is also a little nudity.  I loved the movie, very emotional, I was crying the whole time...
1476715904|5.0|I had never heard of this book before or the author, but it was listed as a book that other customers had purchased based on other books that I had read. I decided to give it a try based on so many great reviews and was PLEASANTLY surprised!!! I was drawn in to the book right from the start and continued to read through the night, which takes A LOT!!! Books generally help me to fall asleep at night and I kept looking over at the clock wishing it wasn't getting later and later and later as I could not put this book down! So many emotions were drawn out of me, including lines of tears just streaming down my face. It is such an easy read and the pages just turn themselves... I would look down and 50 pages had gone by without me being aware that I was turning them!<br />I don't want to ruin the story, but the basic plot is about a girl that moves from Texas to Michigan after the death of her father. He unexpectedly dies of a heart attack and they have no family in Texas. The mother finds a better paying job in Michigan and also has a better support system there. The story is told from \\"Lake's\\" point of view, an 18 year old girl who really doesn't want to move. She has a 9 year old brother. They move into a rental house in Michigan and meet the new neighbors the day that they arrive in their new home. The story blasts off from there with a story of friendship, love and heartache. There were many unpredictable twists and turns that kept me hungering for more. This author is so creative. I was not familiar with what a \\"slam\\" was when I started this book. I also love how the chapters have song lyrics that correspond to what happens in that chapter. I have never read a book like Slammed and I am on my way to get the next book, Point of Retreat, to continue this exciting journey of young love.
B004F5GLJ0|3.0|These movies are real bad, but I keep watching them over and over, just like the harry potter movies.<br /><br />I don't know, I just like the characters soo much, but the movies themselves are pretty bad.<br /><br />Anyways, its a love/hate thing, check them out :)
B000002UZU|5.0|This is an awesome album across the board. John Lee Hooker is on top of his game and is completely in charge. Canned heat defers to him and that appears to be the way that it should have been judging from the end results. There is no Bear on here which is kind of a bummer so a little different then some various Canned Heat incarnations. What a backing band Canned Heat plays on this album. The highlight of this album has to be Alan Wilson's harmonica playing absolutely awesome but not in a flashy way rather in a brilliant accompaniment manner. The stuff he played was really different then most players and the amazing thing is that his playing when he accompanied was really unobtrusive. I also really like the laidback playing of Vestine. YOU ARE DOING YOURSELF A SERIOUS DISSERVICE IF YOU DON'T BUY THIS
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|I like this one.  Not one of their best, but definitely better than the stuff they have been putting out the last few years.  I like Homework and Discovery but only a few random other songs.  Anyways, support their good music and pick up this song!
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Not a bad song on this cd. Love Breeze Blocks and Tesselate. Will be playing this over and over and over ...
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|I get pretty bored when I watch this show, but my GF loves it!<br /><br />My favorite character just got killed off, but at least there are dragons now.  I keep waiting for it to get good.  I get really bored with fantasy stuff, I'm more into sci-fi and real world stuff.<br /><br />This is a very popular show, check it out and see if you like it :)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|time flies by. having way too much fun playing nemo's reef. great color and animation! would recommend for any age.
1451668945|5.0|Great book!!  Mary Higgins Clark never fails me -- keeps me interested from the first line.  Wish she would write more!!
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Takes the genre, rips it apart and puts it back together as something nothing short of brilliant. Ready player one deserves a spot on the shelf to the right of all the SciFi classics.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|It was entertaining and read well, I did not like the way it ended so suddenly it seem to need some kind of closure into the next book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Put it on another device and it's intuitive, so  it seems.  The only way to read a book.  Art books and waiting room magazines may be the only pages I turn in a year's time.  Have to admit I like the tactile feel of turning pages, but I like looking up words and references more.  Reading is a different experience when you can tap into the internet world at the click of a few keys.  Must say I never imagined it and am glad that someone did.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|everyone is saying that it is just a knock off of temple run but I think having a super hero improves it. and its better because of the flying and enemies and basicly its just more entertaining
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Great app for people who enjoy puzzles. The end is a little confusing, there isnt any big finish, the game simply restarts.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|His work is great - the irrationality was my first now i get all of his stuff.<br /><br />Any social observer would love the common sense and practical findings he describes.  A real tour of human behavior.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|its not letting me record. an error blurb keeps coming up saying that it cant connect to the mic. I hav a strange feeling that the original kindle fire(not hd) doesn't have a mic on it. that's the problem the everyone else is having. I'm just guessing.
B0038P80CO|5.0|I won't sum up the plot here as you can read the description above and I don't want to give any spoilers... BUT this movie is fantastic! If you like the original 1979 Alien or The Fly or Event Horizon, or any Sci-Fi Thriller, this is the movie for you!<br /><br />The cast is incredible and Ben Foster easily steals the show with a spot on performance as Bower, the film's protagonist. I can't say enough about his acting- I remember him from a disney show that used to run when I was younger, Flash Forward, needless to say, he has come a long way.<br /><br />The plot: Creative, ostensibly Sci-Fi, cerebral. It is a blast!<br /><br />Pacing: This movie builds tension into a free-fall of terror and action that doesn't stop until the credits roll. A very good job at pacing. The editing in this film is damn near perfect.<br /><br />Acting: As I mentioned above, it is top notch; Ben Foster stands out, for sure, but Dennis Quaid delivers an expectedly solid performance as well.<br /><br />Cinematography: Gorgeous. It isn't the rich colors and wide shots of the Lord of the Rings movies but instead a decidedly cramped, closed, and dark view with a very gritty blue hue. In short, the cinematography is not only incredible, but it is perfectly fit for atmosphere of this movie.<br /><br />Special effects: This is where it is hit or miss. There are some... \\"Characters\\" that should not have been touched with CGI near as much as they were and thus some scenes suffer from sub-par CGI. I am not a fan of CGI when used to fully render an entire character or scene I tend to like it best when used to enhance a live action sequence. Regardless, the CGI is not bad enough to render the film obsolete or laughable, just a stylisic preference really. That being said, there are some awesome effects too. Without spoilers, I'll just say there are some very awesome gore scenes and a few technical shots with water that will blow you away.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great flick if you enjoy the genre. I highly recommend it.. I highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE all of the Fifty Shades books!! You either love them or hate them, I personally LOVE them!  I have read them quite a few times and will probably read them a few more!!
B009MYARIK|5.0|Great book!  She never disappoints!  An awesome summer time novel, light and funny as are all of her books!  Cheers!

0553296981|5.0|Our 11 year old daughter was curious about Anne Frank and this book has opened doors for her. I would encourage all young people to learn more about her interesting life.
B001H1UQZU|5.0|This movie was well written, directed and performed....I laughed, cried and serious thought about what would I do........ Hilary was stunning as always :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It can in great & I love this show !!!<br />So glad I could buy & watch it on here !!!<br />Will do it again !!
B001TH16DI|4.0|The best, and worst, of the original Star Rek movies. Great for Star Trek, the Original Series fans to get their trek on.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Because I could relate to the area where the story was set and understood the first part of the movie having lived there myself.<br /><br />The rest though fictional was very entertaining.
0984334904|4.0|I really like this cards because they have included several examples on the usage of each Kanji, so it is ease to understand the different uses the can have.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Exciting,fun,and addictive. Learning curve is pretty easy and has some challenges for the real gamer.<br />I'm sure many will agree with me that it is a nice way to pass away the time.
0385349831|4.0|Interesting perspective that allows the reader to soul search and think deeply about how they view the world and biblical teachings so many accept as truth.  This is a story to re-visit often and determine how such simple, yet profane knowledge feels 'perfect'.
B001NLJ33K|1.0|If you wanted to torture somebody, make them watch this movie twice.<br /><br />Bad acting.<br /><br />Awful screenplay.<br /><br />Dippy music.<br /><br />Incredibly weird characterizations.<br /><br />Plot sequences that make no sense.<br /><br />If you really really wanted to torture someone, make them watch this three times.
B007L5KT76|5.0|Great sequel to the first movie. If you liked the first, this one is just as good as that one.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|Great cd, arrived in a timely fashion.<br />I opened my package and was surprised to find a Twizzler next to my new cd. It was puzzling and hopefully was a fully intended gesture to be nice.
B005D4YOSW|5.0|Love these sandals. Can't beat the price. If ya want water shoes that can go anywhere these are for you.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Third or forth time I have read this book, I recommend this series to anyone who likes historical fiction, mixed with a bit of fantasy and romance. Diana Gabaldin is Queen!!!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|The plot and action keep moving along without being too wordy. Could not put the book down for long without quickly returning to conclude the story. Thanks David for a great read!
B004EPZ084|3.0|Jennifer Aniston was awesome! She made me hate her. LOL. Kevin Spacey was phenomenal, too, but the 3 friends were sooooo corny, and they had most of the story.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is endless hours of hack n' slash fun. Four distinct and unique classes that are fun to play and if you get bored murdering your foes on your own then join the multi-player and punish your enemies together. Overall a fantastic game and well worth playing especially since it's free.
B004LWZW9C|3.0|I had seen Valentine's Day and LOVED it! Thought this would be the same. It wasn't quite as funny or warming as Valentine's Day, but it was still cute. Loved the football player's part; so unexpected. Anne Hathaway was really convincing, too.
0307454568|5.0|this book was very exciting to read.  once I started I couldnt put it down.  one of the best ever
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This one left me wanting more, and I guess that's the result the author was after, but it also left me a bit deflated. It was high passion, and the story developed the characters a bit more, but I didn't feel this one had the depth of the last one.  I do think, however, it was a great build-up to Fifty Shades Freed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really liked it. It is thought provoking, but is also a good read.  I am looking forward to reading more....
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Saw this in the movies and couldn't resist getting my own copy! The movie is delightfully funny, but it, too, is a standard chick flick. The language was a bit rough at times - they curse through the entire movie. The storyline about the dad was sensationally written; it gave such character to the whole film. LOVED it.
0761169253|4.0|Very good book to inspire ideas, it is great for an Art student, Resident Assistant, Entrepreneure, Business person. This book is great for anyone that needs help being more consistent in thinking creativley.
0345495004|3.0|The product (book-used) was in very good shape.  I have not had time to read- but the lead ins sounded very interesting.
B0042UGMYW|5.0|These two actors were good or 3 I should say. Great movie. Had a good director. Sad and happiness both.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun, addicting and challenging game. It starts so easy but gets progressively difficult so don't be fooled in the beginning!
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I have always loved this movie for the way it related religion and science. It also has one of my favorite quotes, &#34;If it's just us wouldn't that be an awful waste of space?&#34;.<br /><br />If you are looking for an action movie this isn't it. It's also a little dated now technology wise but I think the message really stands the test of time.
B004LROMQG|5.0|This DVD arrived on time and in good condition.  I really love the Merlin series.  I saw this on line and ordered it.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie was amazing.  Loved the message and how it was told.  You are left still wondering which of the stories Pi tells is true, but you are also left with a great respect for his devotion to God.
0307913090|4.0|I finally jumped on the bandwagon and started the series. I have to say the first book is my favorite by far (out of the three of the series I have read). Love, love the Stark family. Some of the more explicit scenes I have skipped over. I don't need 'em to follow the story. The multiple plot lines are fun to follow and I love the multiple perspectives. I think that I am limited to audiobooks with this series; I can't see myself spending the hours needed to complete the novels in print. The narrator for the audiobook does well to dramatize the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game<br />It's fun teaches u to care for all anime no matter what<br />U should rate this game u should play it topic
B000OVLINI|5.0|This has to be one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read!  You will fall in love with the characters, and you will never want the story to end!
B002MFWLXK|4.0|For anyone interested in the conspiracy the surrounds JFK's death then Oliver Stone's movie is for you. However, it is a pleasurable movie for anyone who wants to be entertained and leave the film with something to think about. Overall, a very solid movie through and through.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a good game and I have fun with it but the only thing that I don't really like is that at first u start out slow and than u start to go faster. I guess this is because u have to get comfortable to going fast but I kind of wish that there was the ability to turn that starting out slow thing off.
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|IT just have english language and it should have more than that. The pronunciation of the sentences are not correct.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I play a lot but I want to play with the world put a new version on the kindle please
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is an awesome app! I can use it for my stories I can write! I also like how you can make the person read your text out loud! CREATIVE!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The picture was overly dark most of the time.The plot was rather boring. We expected something better. The acting  by David and Sally were decent enough, just the plot was boring.
B00917IQFY|3.0|Bunch of old guys getting together to relive their past.  Can't blame em.  Certainly better than recent Parker releases.  But it is not like a Dylan album - don't expect any surprises here.
B00AYJBT66|5.0|wow . sounds totally different in mono.warm sound but even more powerful and direct. the guitars seem more focused and stronger. Like hearing it for the first time again!
B009PK9SB8|2.0|The backpack, when used with the Hero is glitchy.  Probably something wrong with it and im too lazy to send it back.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|if you cant have new steely dan . this will do and then some!!! great guitar work on this effort
0529064847|4.0|I am a novice, and I like it.  Seems to have all the good stuff in it, I don't like the commentary mixed in with the text, I would rather see it on the bottom, kind of a drag, but there are some that would like it i bet.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this before I saw the movie & it instantly became my new favorite book.  It pulled me in & a book hasn't done that in a long time.  This book made me miss reading & also made me wish this book was longer.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|If you consider this is a middle book in a trilogy and realize not everything will be tied up in a bow and finalized since a 3rd book still needs to be released, I thought this book had a lot that happened, a lot was explained, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I kept looking at my percentage complete on my kindle and was so sad to see the book end.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Loved reading the challenges the girls were put through to see who excelled -test the girls on who could do the job as a princess later on<br />Lots of rebel action<br />Petty cat fights. Wanted to see Celeste get what was due to her.<br />Learned more about the background of the country, caste system. How it got to be the way it was. Was interesting I thought.<br /><br />Cons:<br />So frustrating to see the back and forth does she love Aspen or Maxson. But I would go completely crazy myself if I saw my guy flirting with so many other girls also, so I feel for America. Not many cons.<br /><br />The author did a great job describing everything without too much detail so you can actuallyfeel what America was going through. I can't wait for book 3. And I have recommended this series to all my gal friends. Quick read. Worth the purchase.
B001GF8WPI|1.0|I never have problems with my items but this time was ridiculous, shipment was slow and they sent a different version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Similar to temple run. The kids love it and it was a free app! I play the game all the time. The kids always ask to play!
B00024I2Z4|4.0|Its a great movie, cute for kids and if your a disney mania person then its for you.Good for your collection of disney movies.

B0043JDUNS|4.0|Exciting.  The end was a little... over the top.  But you get the idea of what makes Tony Stark tick.  Pepper was awesome.
B00947N6D8|4.0|Although the case is damaged, I still rate this as 4 due to the fact that the price of the movie was worth as advertised!
B001EBWING|5.0|A true classic.  You have to understand a little WW2 history to really get it... but if you have a little context you will love it.  A love story that will tear at your heart.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I grew up watching Star Trek, thanks to my mom, and I love the original movies, as well as the newer versions of the series.  I'm glad to say that I now own these movies and that I can watch them whenever I want!
B0061QD88S|3.0|I dislike  that it was not snug in the package. It also was clanging around in the case.I have never before received an order when ONLY one of 4 was as described.I am unsure if this was original,considering the wrap was not normal with all the & lables etc  on it to show you it had never been used or opened.  Like the others,I have not had time yet to see  if this is scratched. Gosh,I hope not.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|When I was little, my mom showed me episodes 4-6 and I loved them.  I have seen them all many times.  Then Episodes 1-3 came out when I was a teenager and I love those too.  I'm glad that I own these, in a great box set, and can watch them whenever I want!
0061537969|5.0|Anyone who loves animals will enjoy this tale told by a dog's perspective.  it was an easy read and I finished it in 2 days.
B00B9YDT5Y|5.0|This contains multiple CDs.  Loaded them all on computer and iPhone.  Definitely recommend the one with the third CD, as it contains previously unreleased music.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|OK For all you So Called Reviewers out there you have no Idea what a Big Action Movie is and Bruce Willis Really Delivers in this Movie Hell its even better then the 4th one.When I was done seeing this in Theaters I was Shocked at how Good it Really was when I walked out I told myself im getting this Movie on BLU-RAY.So for all you other people who haven't written a Review well here ya go and don't listen to these other Idiots on here cause obviously they have no taste when it comes to Action but I do.The Story is Good the Action is BadAss and the Acting is Good to they really went all out on this Movie its like Stallone's Expendables and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator Combined If you love an Action Feast this is It People Trust Me I know what I say when I say it about a Movie.CRASHES/EXPLOSIONS/GUNFIGHTS Its all in here.
031236198X|5.0|This book is a &#34;must have&#34; for leaders and followers in any organization.  It's a quick, easy read and really does address issues that leaders face when dealing with adversity.  I found myself placing faces with the characters and laughed out loud several times while reading it.  Finished it in about 2 hours.  Packs alot of punch in a small book.  Great service, arrived very quickly and the price isright.  Read this and share with everyone in your work place.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is my favorite author. I read every thing he writes. This book is great. Would recommend it to anyone.
1452101248|5.0|I was visiting some friends and they made something really yummy with eggplant.  They showed me the cookbook with the recipe and i couldn't wait to get home and order it after thumbing through and seeing the great selections.  If you want to get away from meat and potatoes, you'll love this book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I seriously use this thing every night to fall asleep. Literally limitless listening possibilities. It even relaxes my dog when she is anxious!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what it should.  Nice to have on hand without haviing to carry an additional device.  I recommend this app.
0739352962|5.0|great product got it on time great packageing cds very new just love my cds will recommend to anyone great company to shop with
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is very fun and super addictive!!! My daughter loves it on her kinked and now I love it too!  I love it and hey the price was right!
B00631VJIC|5.0|One of the best shows ever and the soundtrack is awesome. &#34;This Life&#34; is such a great theme song and the lovely Katey Sagal does a great version of &#34;Preachers Son&#34;. Worth every penny.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|Music by Morricone played by Yo-Yo Ma is an unbeatable combination. More pleasurable than I expected. A highly recommended recording.
1476715904|5.0|Thank you Colleen hoover! It had been I awhile since I read such a great book. I just wish a had my own will.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|Absolutely loved it. I action is set up more like a play with sets than a movie. I thought the characters were great. For someone who has read the book, I feel think Jude Law and Matthew Macfadyen were spot on. I wasn't so impressed with the choice of who played Levin, I don't think they did his character justice. If you like plays you will like this. It is a more artistic approach and not your average &#34;blockbuster&#34; movie. Someone who hasn't read the book or doesn't know the story might have a hard time following along. The plot and character development moves really fast.
B000002MFE|5.0|Perfect in every way.  This album is a favorite in my collection  The songs are some I never get tired of hearing,  It has a permanent slot on my CD changer.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|it is a lot like yu gi oh or kaijudo and is very addictive. i just wish you could get a free card every 24 hours like in monsterlife from game loft
B002JVWRAE|4.0|The show is very entertaining.  It's well written, mostly well acted and very well scored.<br /><br />Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley, Kat Graham and Candice Accola fill out their roles nicely.  The writing staff keep things moving, and the love story between Elena and Stefan is less sappy than it could have been in the hands of other less able writers.<br /><br />The weakest links in this season are Vicki and Jenna.  Jenna is the aunt of Jeremy and Elena, and she looks about 5 years older than her high school aged niece.  Vicki is the show's second fiddle bad girl/party animal.  Kayla Ewell isn't as talented as the rest of the cast, nor does she have much to work with in the first place.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|My 3 year old loves the Ice Age series.  This one doesn't fail at keeping her interested, laughing and entertained.  Great buy!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|A very exciting , deep suspensful mini series. Ron Berry who l purchased this from is a gentlemen to deal with looking foward to doing business with him again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found this book to be a quick read.  It definitely keeps you interested and can't wait to find out what happens next!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This one gets a five from me because I'm a huge fan of Mr. King' s work and this is no exception.  While it's not horror like many of his writings, it is definitely scary in the truest sense.  It's also a love story, go figure.  This book would make a very interesting movie!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was one of the best things ever shown ton TV, Maggie Smith makes the show.  I can't wait for the next season to begin.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|Not too geeky, not to maistream.<br />No crazy/eccentric russian cosmonaut<br />No extra slutty scandinavian astronaut<br />No extra cyborg or xenomorph
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I love this movie brandon lee I recommend for all the collectors because is a good movie bluray high definition simply it's the best
0061950726|4.0|Double-narrative novels seem all in vogue these days; Orphan Train is the third I've read in as many months. As a writer, I recognize that this narrative choice take some skill to achieve. Indeed, in a post-book interview, Kline speaks of her desire to balance her parallel narratives. \\"Sometimes I gave myself a headache trying to figure out how it all fit together.\\" Fortunately for us, she artfully succeeds.<br /><br />In shades of Jane Eyre and Anne of Green Gables, Orphan Train gives us a fascinating glimpse into a little-known period of American history. It is a poignant story of two young Americans, living nearly a century apart, who find themselves caught in terrible circumstances beyond their control. It's a story of cultural identity, family history, identifying the things we value enough to take with us, and fate.<br /><br />Kline's language is flowing and evocative without being flowery. (I like that.) She's also a very powerful writer. At times I found myself clenching my fists, enduring a swelling rage at her gripping portrayals of injustice, abuse and degradation-circumstances that often resulted from the well-intentioned but completely inept decisions of supposedly good people.<br /><br />Toward the end of the novel, Molly asks this: \\"So is it just human nature to believe that things happen for a reason--to find some shred of meaning even in the worst experiences?\\"<br /><br />I liked how Kline's story answers that question. It ultimately left me with a feeling of hope, not only for these characters, but for all of us who seek meaning in our lives.<br /><br />Thanks to She Reads and William Morrow for providing me a copy to review. All opinions are mine.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This was a great movie. The interaction and dialogue between Lawrence and Cooper was awesome.  Add that to Senior and the rest of the supporting cast to a fantastic story line and youhave the makings a a film worth watching over and over.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app is the coolest app I've ever played from the app store. It's certainly keeps u busy. Especially when u are waiting in a line somewhere or waiting for the doctor to call you.
0060853972|5.0|If your not a fan of either Neil Gaiman or Terry Pratchett before reading this book, you will be after.<br /><br />I had only read several of Gaiman's books before this, and never any of Pratchett's.  This book changed that, together their styles blend and meld into a excellent written story filled with humor both overt and subtle.  All of this humor, which at times forced me to drop the book and hold my sides laughing, does nothing to detract from the plot, which is itself a masterpiece.<br /><br />Pick this book up and read it, you won't regret it.  Unless you don't understand humor.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have not wanted to put this book down. I've read it in a day! It is so full of every emotion possible. And there are  so many twists. I can not wait for \\"Losing Hope\\" to come out<br /> This is a MUST READ!!!!!
B007W1BLN0|5.0|A movie that is difficult to categorize, one that is at times painful to watch, at times intensely beautiful.  But it is consistent and true. The journey of a young man who finds a truth that we can all embrace is expressed in a way that allows us to see through the narcissism of youth.  It directs us so that we can peer directly not only into the abyss of pain that involves growing up but into the joy of embracing nature.  And in the end it recognizes humankind as an essential part of nature's community, a community that can not be truly experienced without sharing.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|It was an amazing game to play it is very addicting and yu get to upgrade yur<br />weapons which makes it even better.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am very,very,very disappointed in finding out in season three the producers are going to have Matthew die in a auto accident after he just see's his son, how disappointing, so very disappointing. This will certainly change the way I view the show along with millions of other viewers like myself. I really think they ought reconsider.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|couldn't put this book down. really addictive and interesting. joe has a unique style of writing that makes you feel like you really understand the characters
B005LAIIPS|5.0|A great movie, different than the Bourne movies, however still very good.  A very fast moving movie, never a dull moment.
B0055S348W|1.0|I tried it and it sees my wifi printer but won't select it.  Amazon doesn't make refunds easy on digital orders.  BEWARE!
B009AMANBA|5.0|If you like US History, this is a must see movie.  The story is great, you feel like you are back in the 1860s.  Great scenery, great costumes, really seemed like you went back in time. Daniel Day-Lewis is tremendous in this movie, as were many other actors. Highly recommended if you have any interest in US History.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great Season!  Can't wait for the next season to start.<br />Character development superb.  Can't get enough of this story.<br />LOVE IT.L
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Tremendous movie, a must see!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has an interest in USA world affairs and world politics
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Animated movie sequels are truly hit-or-miss, and are most often miss.  Notable exceptions have included the Toy Story trilogy, and now includes the Cars movies.  Far from playing on old jokes from the first movie, this really served to develop each of the characters in a totally new plot.  Bravo to Disney-Pixar for doing a great job with this movie!
B003O86MY8|5.0|I love David Garrett's music! when i received the cd it was in really good shape; brand new! no scratches or cracks. thanks =)
B005LAIGJQ|1.0|What sad commentary that a movie this bad can get made.  Every scene when Eddie Murphy (Jack McCall) tried to be funny was pathetically contrived, forced, and plain stupid.  Murphy has either totally sold out and just looks to get paid, or he no longer can spot a good script, good writing, and decent plots.  If this movie was on Pandora, I would have hit thumbs down instantly, along with never play this again.<br /><br />But since I am an eternal optimist and forever hopeful, I kept watching it, hoping for Beverly Hills Cop Eddie Murphy or Trading Places Eddie to come out, but instead it became more nauseating with every scene and every turn.  I realize it was a comedy/slash romantic comedy, but it did neither very well.  The entire movie insults the audience's intelligence and the funniest guy in it was Jack McBrayer (Starbucks employee).  Comedy classics like Hangover, Something About Mary, Vacation, Airplane, Superbad, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, etc. are not just above it, they are leagues apart from it.<br /><br />If this is as good as Eddie Murphy can get today, he should retire.  Then again, may be he needs money badly because he agreed to star in this total waste of 91 minutes of my time and of film.  I never thought Adam Sandler's \\"That's My Boy\\" would have company so quickly as worst comedy ever made.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I love 2cellos. Their classical music is amazing! when i reevied the cd in the mail it was in prefect condition, no scraches or cracks. thank you =)
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|The first thing I noticed was that in the opening dialogue Merlin is now a young man, not a young boy. When that change occurred I can't be certain. Not inappropriate considering Colin Morgan's 27 years old. He was a New Year's baby if you didn't know. Season 5 begins 3 years later. Uther is dead though his spirit is restless, and Arthur is King and married to Gweneviere. Morgana still haunts the shadows and Modred becomes a knight of Camelot. Arthur's Bane is Arthur himself sowing the seeds of his own downfall. Otherwise little seems to have changed. Merlin still lives in the room off Gaius' Lab, still wears the same clothes he was dressed in walking into Camelot, he's still Arthur's servant, and sorcery is still banned though with Modred on the scene more people are aware and able to practice it.<br /><br />One of the strengths of the series and BBC Productions in general is the attention to detail as seen in the hazing that goes on when Modred sets out with the knights on his first mission--he is asked to ride seated backward on his saddle and subjected to other ignominities. Such extras add a sense of reality to a show that also features dragons and unicorns.<br /><br />Morgana inhabits a dark tower not unlike those seen in Lord of the Rings though one suspects this one is CGI produced. This final season has a darker tone. Arthur is king so his carefree days are behind him though we see little of the tedious duties that must attend such a position. Plotlines centre around attempts to cause the king harm and Morgana appears at the centre of most. The relationship between Merlin and Arthur is still the central theme of the series.<br /><br />Arthurian Legend has been reworked and re-imagined countless times in the last millennial. This series is yet another in the long line. The mythic bits are all in place though the round table looks rather cramped in Pierrefonds Throne Room. And as Excalibur is cast into the lake at Avalon the Lady's arm rises from the lake to grasp it and we bid farewell to Arthur and Merlin.grasp it and we bid farewell to Arthur and Merlin.
B0000714BP|5.0|The movie was hysterical ....<br />The guys did a great job.<br />It takes a real actor to take on a challenge like this...<br />Great Job<br /><br />I know that everyone would enjoy the humor in this movie
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Surprised my kids with this pre-ordered DVD which came in the mail just when the ads said it was available to purchase.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|What a great movie<br />I was at first a little hesitant ....but wow<br />The special effects were outstanding.<br /><br />I would totally recommend it to anyone<br /><br />Thumbs up
B009GXHOW4|4.0|I like this app because you can edit your inventory and change from creative to survival and vice versa ( there's animals in creative mode!!!!). But it won't work unless your on peaceful mode and sometimes it will not work anyways.  There's also a bug in typing the amounts. Some people say its confusing but I saw a how to on YouTube which helped a lot. So I enjoy this helpful app and I am hoping to purchase the pro version soon.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|As a kid I enjoyed watching the original Dark Shadows and again Johnny Depp was great.<br />I am glad they did not take it too far and I hope they will consider doing another one.<br /><br />Everyone that remembers the original one will enjoy this movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is a real tear jerker but still a pretty awesome read. It sticks with you long after turning the last page. I highly recommend.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I was very impressed with the remake of this movie. I was also, glad they did not take away from the original. Johnny Depp is a super actor. I would recommend this to anyone. The affects were outstanding
B001CTDH76|5.0|I just started watching the Mentalist and I really wanted to find out how it started, and I must say it was just as good in the beginning as the current episodes are.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I absolutely love mystery games and hidden object games so this 2 in 1 really hits the jackpot. I haven't paid for anything either. I just keep playing to earn money and diamonds. Best game ever!!!!!!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great movie, it drags a bit at times, but still worth buying. It really makes you think what it took to find and kill a scumbag terrorist who's name isn't even worth mentioning.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This app is perfect!!! Just what I was looking for scary. It's super awsome when you get tense and your heart pounds.I suggest you get this app it's worth the .99 cents
B008JFUO36|4.0|I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan in the world, but I am a huge Morgan Freeman fan and an even bigger science fiction fan.  This movie promised to be a real eye-popper and it met those expectations very well.  I even liked Tom Cruise's performance. My only negative is that I think they give away too much too soon. If you are crafty and attentive enough, you can figure out the secret, which kind of spoils the fun.  It's not an epic movie and the plot isn't the most amazing in the world, but it was a very enjoyable movie.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|The concept of life being more than the here and now intrigue me.<br />Dr Eben held the scientific view and his experience led him to analysis<br />his death experience.<br />Some of his experience retelling was strange, maybe a 'Revelation type vision'.<br />Some of this left me disappointed, I liked his medical analysis at particular<br />spots of his experience.<br />I would recommend this to anyone wishing to understand life past death.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan all of my life, seeing every episode of the original, most of the episodes of all the other spin offs, and all of the movies.  I had thought Gene Roddenberry's brain-child about as far as it could go - until J.J. Abrams got into the mix.  The big-screen experience is a cinematic/special effects wonderland.  The character selection is perfect.  Most importantly, the story is mind-blowingly refreshing, wiping out over 25 years of established Star Trek lore and opening the door to another 25+ years.  I don't often give 5 star movie reviews... but this one deserves it (at least in my opinion).
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I'd loved this movie when I first saw it and I love it still now. An excellent movie, if you are an action adventure lover like me.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I just can't watch this movie enough.  I'm basically a middle-aged kid when it comes to movies like this. Fun. Entertaining. This one just gets in your head and stays there - even the music... \\"I'm having a bad, bad, day...\\" Plus,(sorry... spoilers) I love it when the bad guy becomes the good guy.  This one is an instant classic!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a fun game. You can send your horses to competitions all over the world. The horses can train and be fed so they can get healthy and fit.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I agree with other reviewers who are wondering where all the bad reviews are coming from!  It's a DIE HARD movie so you know exactly what you are going to get when you pay your money at the box office.  If you are a DIE HARD fan, this movie gives you exactly what you are expecting... ridiculously crazy action.  No way John McClane can survive another bad situation - but you know he will because it's John McClane and you can't wait to find out how bad he gets beat up in the process.  If you don't like this kind of action, don't watch it, but for what it is supposed to be, this is a good movie!
B008J2GAKU|5.0|If you are a fan of Batman then this is a must read!  This is in the class of The Dark Knight and The Long Halloween. Vintage Batman.  Read it now. You will not regret it.
0525425764|5.0|This book is the third novel in the series by John Grisham and addresses issues that affect tweens and teens: computer hacking, bullying, divorce and Internet safety. Theo doesn't always seek help from his parents when he is in trouble, and he lets his uncle talk him into doing some questionable investigating. The dilemmas he faces are appropriate for tweens and teens but not for younger kids, who might not get the nuances when Theodore faces issues that don't have clear right or wrong answers. Read the book and you will know what really happen.
B00C0P08CI|1.0|Can't watch because the video buffers for minutes on end.  Lousy streaming don't know why this video is not streaming properly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have been playing for quite awhile now. I just love playing a few times a day I check in and grab my coins and stars. The characters are so cute. I really enjoy trying to get the most money out of every family with the decorations and friends hearts.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|So far I only saw the movies, but I decided to pick up the books and read my favorite movies.<br />I started with Dr. No and the book is just great!  All these little extra details that they couldn't fit in the movie.<br /><br />My next one will most likely be Goldfinger
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|I would have to say the answer to their question Now What?! is \\"put out a great album and continue doing what we love.\\" I think this is a very strong effort and worth an top spot in<br />your summer rotation. Highly recommend.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|awesome completion to the series, very enjoyable.  I thin Sanderson really gets it and I really enjoyed it.  Highly recommend.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|It was very fun, something new, Adam Sandler was very funny in it, he has been one of my favorite comedians for a long time. With grown-up movies his humor can be a little crude but it doesn't really offend me. Knowing that's normally how his humor is, I can appreciate how he kept it so clean and young-child-friendly :D, yet very, very amusing for us, the parents. Very much unlike Wreck it Ralph, which made me feel very uncomfortable at different points throughout the movie. See? There CAN be a cool and clean movie for children without unnecessary stuff in it that I would have to explain to my kids and try to keep them from copying.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 has a great story, excellent music and  amazing visuals. This is a must have for the Playstation Vita!!!!
B003QSMC18|5.0|Good old fashioned Disney movie! Just like before Pixar and all that. I love Pixar movies, but I miss the different kind of art and animation the older movies have.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig did a great job as 007 as an older spy.  I liked the story line but was sad at the end. I'll let you see and decide if you agree.
B009LGO88E|5.0|My son wanted this to use with his Nintendo 3ds. He's very good about reviewing what he wants for his gaming and, although we live in the US, this accessory works perfectly with his game console.  He is very pleased with how it works.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is a really good movie.  Ben Affleck outdid himself with this one. It seems to be a pretty acurate account of what happened.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Not much revealed here. Some parts were very funny, but often followed by some vulgar explanations. Rather blunt and unfinished tale, much like Saturday Night Live.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I love this move, it's close enough to the book that any minor changes are ok. I know that the rest of the book is coming.  I just wish they were out now.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Big Fish has a history of releasing games at a good clip, whether filling a need or simply filling their queue with product. This is a run of the mill jewel matching game, nothing special or innovative. An okay game to past the time between releases of the better versions.
B002N4DZ3K|3.0|This opera arrived in good condition, but the performance of this piece is not what I thought it was. The opera is not near as good as the overture to this piece of Richard Strauss. I was always impressed by the overture of this particular piece, but the opera just wasn't what I expected.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love this game more than any on my kindle! I only have this game because it was free a while back, and I figured why not? I have since fallen in love with the peaceful urgency this game presents. It is great to do a few levels before bed to unwind and slow down my mind enough to relax :D I highly recommend this game, even at full price, it's worth it in so many levels!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Started watching Downton Abbey when I was down with back issues. My husband, an action show person, started watching with me and now he is hooked.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have been waiting for these to come out on blue ray for sometime. The transfer was done well and looks to be remastered nicely. The audio is surround sound capable which is expected for any blue ray. Worth every penny.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This, I must say, was the only truly disappointing movie installment.  I should have simply re-read the book.  Oh well...
0307476073|5.0|I'm not a backpacker, and that kept me from picking this book up for a long while thinking it might not be relevant for me. But while this book is certainly Cheryl Strayed's journey hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, it's really about much more than that. This is a story of reconciling grief, gaining perspective, and preparing for a life of one's own design rather than a life created not by decision, but by default. Wild is well written, well paced, and engaging from page 1.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Not quite as impressive as the beginning, but then again how could it be?  Hopefully, the buzz about the prequel is not just rumour.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Fantastic movie. Very enjoyable thriller, great to add to any film buffs collection. Well worth your time and money. Looking forward to the sequels.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Love this collection of songs.  As Boz has gotten older his voice has gotten richer yet he still has the range that he always has had.  He also assembles an amazing group of musicians and background singers including as on this album, the amazing  Ms. Monique.
145470246X|5.0|well written, beautiful pictures, and pattern that are easy to follow. The results will amaze you.  well worth the price of purchase.
B005P3NPXG|4.0|It was a cd I wanted for my collection. I've always enjoyed music by Seal, and I thank Amazon.com for having access to the music I need.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|&#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; is very sensuous, unique and fun reading!!!...couldn't put it down... can't wait to read the sequels.
0871164566|5.0|A good book for beginner or experienced alike. I liked the description of the many ways the designs can be used or modified for use in many other projects.
1451695195|4.0|I have just started to read Proof of Heaven and already can't put it down and If any one is not sure of life after death or in GOD they should read this book.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Another season of the spectacular cast and the best writing anywhere on television! The story gets more interesting with every episode.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|In my view, Chicago VII may mark  the high-point of the band's career: the first two sides are essentially instrumentals that feature the band at its most experimental and creative.  Could you imagine *any* group trying to put out a double album today that eschewed a pop format for something new and bold?  I've said it before and I'll say it again: It's a crime this band is not in the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame!
1609611543|5.0|Wow, a great book and one I would recommend to everyone.  This book really opens your eyes to the dangers of wheat.
B008RYN44U|3.0|No where near as good as any other ND album. I used to love ND. I lost a lot of respect for Gwen Stefani when she went solo and sang about a lot of nonsense and riches. This is a little better.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|Capote was one of the greatest character creators in American literature.  This work is a perfect example.<br />His mark is made as a writer.
B002DJZJT8|5.0|Great cast! Mark Walburg played crazy bf with bad past. Alyssa Milano in early twenties plays whore wich she does very well!
B00B2166BS|5.0|The pogo cable makes charging my Nexus 10 a breeze. Very easy to connect.<br /><br />I wish it would have come with the actual plug that plugs into the outlet.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I decided to download this app on a whim.  I was extremely pleased with the interface and found multiple uses for the Timers4Me &amp; Stopwatch Pro. I end up using it daily at work, which uncomplicated some of the tasks that I do.

B00AZQGZVM|5.0|Just another Animal Crossing fan, who could not resist this plush of Totakeke especially for the price of $20!! I am very happy to own this and make a collection of this videogame series!! For those who are collecting!! this is a must buy!!
B000W25ASS|5.0|I now have the trilogy complete. &#34;outlandos de amour&#34;, &#34;regatta de blanc&#34; and &#34;zenyatta mendotta&#34;,  the best three police albums,
0061928356|4.0|Secret Daughter was about Kavita, who living in India where sons are preferred more than daughters, takes her newborn daughter to an orphanage to prevent her from getting killed like so many newborn girls do.  The daughter, Asha, is adopted by an American couple.  The story follows both Asha's life with her American family and Kavita's and her husbands life.  At first I didn't much like any of the characters besides Kavita.  I thought Kavita's husband, Jasu, was cruel and insensitive.  I thought Somer, Asha's adopted mother, was annoying.  She didn't really have much drive, or backbone.  She kind of let herself go.  I kept wanting her to get up and move and get out of the slump she seemed to be in.  Krishnan, the adoptive father, was just uninteresting.  Asha was really insensitive and disrespectful towards Somer.  Throughout the story, however, I was amazed at how the characters grew, especially Jasu.  I think I enjoyed him the most by the end even though I found him horrible in the beginning.  It was also a joy to watch Somer get herself together and get her life back.  You will not be disappointed with this story.  Never have I read a book where the characters grow so much throughout the book as this one and it was wonderful to see.  I think it would be great as a movie!
030758836X|1.0|For being on the best selling list for so long figured it must be good.  Cannot perceive how it  ever got there.
B00A1EOBJQ|2.0|I loved these songs on the show and they sounded SO good.  Maybe the CD isn't mastered well.  It sounds like it was recorded in a basement and NONE of these people (well, except the little girls and whoever plays scarlett) sound like they could be professional country stars. big let down :-/
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Manliest movie ever... A must see if you haven't already, one of Tarantino's greatest works yet with a great cast
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Easy A is a great movie ! I love Emma Stone and the whole story line and plot is very cute.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is epic although people say it sucks they are wrong this game comes out with updates .Enjoy this it is worth the money.
B00ANYJ3NI|4.0|I am a finance Ph.D. and professor who has taught investment related courses for 35 years. I am also very well read in the practical aspects of Wall St.  So this was a wonder read and I learned some very interesting things, especially about the players who shorted the housing market.  However, even with my knowledge, there were parts that were difficult to understand and which would have been explained better.  Overall, it was well worth the time to read
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I chose this rating because it described an actual historic event in an interesting style. Also, the roles were played by good actors.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this free app several months ago on my tablet....I love it. I leave it on my nightstand and play Relax Melodies every night when I go to sleep. I like being able to combine the different sounds together. Get it....you'll like it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I remember some girls were arguing over how it was going to rain on Friday. I told them to go to the NWS, and it said it wasn't going to rain on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday in San Diego. It only sparkled on Sunday and it didn't rain. Sucks how most of us rely on apps and news to not get the weather right.<br />/<br />The Weather Channel app is the same as the maps shown on the news, which most of the times don't even get the weather right. Its still better to have some guess than no guess at all
0802473156|3.0|The information about the different love languages and how to use them to communicate with your partner are very helpful. I think its a good read for any couple. The examples that he uses to describe the love languages get a little redundant and I found myself skimming though them to get to the main ideas. This book could use, (if there isn't one already), a short story version.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I had heard nothing but good things about this movie from friends so I finally decided to watch it, I was blown away and entertained throughout the whole movie. Karl Urban was perfect as Judge Dredd as was Olivia Thirlby as Anderson. The movie engages you in the action right from the start with some pretty violent action scenes and a cool soundtrack to go along with it. The story is simple but keeps you watching and entertained. It's a shame the poor box office sales mean we most likely won't get another Dredd movie for a while, but I highly recommend anyone that's a fan of comic books or action movies to watch this.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Even tho I can only watch the 1st two episodes because Amazon has not released the others I am totally enjoying this season so far... I became a fan recently & blew right thru seasons 1 & 2!  I can't wait to watch episodes 3-9 of season 3 as soon as they're released!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is really good because it is a fun game to play. I like it how you have to collect products to complete the daily challenge!!!
0671891634|5.0|If you intend to begin trading on the markets then I would recommend this book for sure.  It is easy to read and gives you the oppertunity to watch the career of a very successful trader from his perspective, If you are serious about trading, read it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I so enjoyed the Hunger Games so much I had to continue the series. I have read this book twice, recommend it to any one that likes a good book set with promise of action, suspense, violence and a bit of romance.
0345803485|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because I really enjoyed reading it. Anyone who loves a good love story with some kink to it would really love this book and all it has to offer. I can not wait to order the second and third one and see what happens next.
B008CRC506|5.0|loved it,adult version of glee,and a great cast,was a well picked cast and has some great known actors,worth watching over and over
B000NI8F5G|5.0|Moviemaking and Gene Kelly at their finest.  Keeps you smiling and laughing for 2hrs.  The movie and its backstory are both fascinating.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie, true to the novel. Makes me look forward to the next segment of the Hobbit. A must see!
B00A11AN6O|2.0|Does not work properly, ever-time I go to iCloud, it says not available try back later.  Makes me so frustrated.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game play is fun and the visuals are good but without spending money you run out of energy faster than I would like even for a free game.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|720p is pretty much only streams that will show. However only one maybe two will be 720p in what you want to watch. Can't sign in either. Twitch tv need to show there app alot of attention...

B002XTBE6K|5.0|what i especially liked about this version of emma is that every nuance of the book is developed.  this is impossible in a movie.  this version was done for british tv and had four long segments. no prior version has brought out so well emma holed up in the country with her hypochondriac father and kind governess.  her father cannot bear for her to travel so emma must amuse herself with the people in the neighborhood, her dolls and these two adults.  hers is a privileged existence but she cannot grow in this stifling atmosphere.<br /><br />unfortunately, she carries into her young adult life all the things she used to do as a child to amuse herself. seeing the people around her as bigger versions of her dolls and her imaginary world, she sets herself up as a matchmaker.  she has initial success with her governess and her sister.  this goes to her head and she spins straight into disaster with their successors whose lives she tries to manage.<br /><br />mr knightley. played by the wonderful jonny lee miller, is her neighbor and also the person who tries to bring her to her senses.  this also brings them into one another's notice as romantic interests for the first time.<br /><br />there are great comic characters throughout too.  my favorite was Mr. elton, the preacher.  somehow austen's vicars are always great comic characters. emma mismanages him completely as one of her bridegroom dolls for a protege.  austen also loved invalids and this time it is emma's father who fits the bill. he worries about his health endlessly.  and then there is mrs. bates, who talks constantly and drives emma bats.<br /><br />i also really liked the gwyneth paltrow-jeremy northan version of emma but that had the shortened length working against it.  if you want the full emma from the page, this is that version.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001TH16DI|5.0|It is Fantastic that Paramont has made these improvements on DVD BLUE RAY so we can see what it looked like in the theaters. And the additional contents is worth the price!! I would reccomend this collection to any Star Trek Fan.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I watched the awards Feb 2013 and heard Suit & Tie and instantly loved it. I decided at that moment I was buying the CD regardless if there were any other good songs on it or not. Pleasantly 20/20 is fantastic from beginning to end; from the southern Blues genre to the techno-matic melodies; India influences to the classical...you will not be disappointed, in fact it is a must for the music lover library!!!!!! Well done Mr Timberlake!!
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Rather disappointing movie even though it did win some awards. I think the award was for the musical score which I hardly noticed when viewing the movie.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed the movie.  Would recommend it to a friend.  We are fans of both stars.
B009R659L8|3.0|I found the book to be very boring and details detached. I am a Mary Higgins Clark fan from waaaayyyyy back but found this book to be her worst.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This was one of the first apps I got for my new Kindle Fire HD and boy, is it ever terrific. I love that in an instant I can check the charge, and you know why? It is that darn Angry Birds game that is trying to take over my life. Thank goodness I fixed the setting to tell me by voice when my charge is getting low. This is the most helpful, smart, and must-have app ever. Thank you, Amazon!<br />(Now if I can just get past Birds Hoax Level 14...)
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This movie seemed to bridge the gap between monsters made from people in<br />ugly costumes to real technology , special effects and good acting.
B008MM9630|5.0|What a lovely game for kids of all ages! The graphics are beautiful and it is not necessary to make in game purchases, only if you are an impatient soul. Just give it a try and see for yourself!
B005LAIHYU|2.0|I tried, I really did.  I suspended disbelief and mentally prepared myself that I was about to watch a movie featuring such an outrageous, fantastical story that was going to be anathema to the actual historical Abe Lincoln--that I was about to be presented with utter nonsense.  And to be fair, ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER is well-made, from its in-depth cinematography to impressive sets and costumes to spare-no-expense special effects; the filmmakers definitely cut no corners.  But still. . .in spite of all my efforts not to smirk, roll my eyes, or just burst into hysterical laughter, this clucker is so inane and brain-dead stupid I found myself rapidly doing all of the above.<br /><br />Who knew the Civil War was fought so vampires could have their own country?  To Hades with slavery; slaves were mere food for the evil Southern vampires.  And since his mother was killed by a bloodsucker when Honest Abe (who, it turns out, is not so honest) was a boy, the rail-splitting soon-to-be politician has been hacking vamps to smithereens with his silver-plated ax (which also doubles as a shotgun for those most opportune times).  And what's the lone weapon that can kill an army of Southern vampires?  Silver bullets!  So President Abe has every piece of silver in Washington melted down and molded into bullets, hauling the payload himself via rail to Gettysburg--and fighting four score of vampires en route.  There.  Just had a good belly laugh as I wrote this.  And naturally, as it's only fitting for a movie so outrageously over the top, once the vamps decide it's feeding time their mouths and fangs grow to piranha proportions.  Those changes created the most laughs for me.  Funny stuff.  The cast, except for a bored looking Rufus Sewell, is totally forgettable; there are even attempts to present Lincoln the speechmaker in a serious tone that backfire profusely.  If you like good horror ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER falls short; if you like a riveting story ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER falls even shorter.  But if you like bad, by all means give ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER a look.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.OLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER falls even shorter.  But if you like bad, by all means give ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER a look.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Great opening book!! This series is pretty great... You will not regret reading all 10 books!! Malazan book of the Fallen!!
0439023521|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie adaptation of it and I was still on the edge of my seat while turning the pages. I rode the emotional roller coaster with Katniss. This fiction was raw. It was very realistic in the way that it portrayed young people's response under the stressful and terrifying circumstances of the story setting. Characters were well developed. This was great writing and it will thrill generations to come. Book two is setting out and waiting for me.
0374533571|4.0|[[ASIN:0374533571 The Silver Linings Playbook [movie tie-in edition]: A Novel]][[ASIN:B00A81MV3U Silver Linings Playbook]]<br />Hello Fellow Fathomers! Today in The Locker I combine a book review with a movie review for The Silver Linings Playbook. As soon as the movie released last fall in the theater, I just had to go see it. (and I see few movies in the theater)<br />Matthew Quick's excellent, heartfelt novel provided the start of a screenplay with substance. From the opening scene to the end, David O. Russell captured my imagination and I found myself cheering that he did not try to \\"fix\\" anyone- instead, he revealed to the audience how life actually is for many people living with various degrees of mental illness. For 122 minutes, we see a glimpse into the highs and lows that sometimes cycle for people several times within a given day.<br />I identified with the mother, Dolores, played so brilliantly by Jacki Weaver- trying to hold her family together while standing firm to her own principles. Walking the tightrope by offering her crabbie snacks and homemades on game day and encouraging positive behavior by setting boundaries, she epitomizes a mother's love for Pat working so hard to find his Silver Lining. With two young adult sons of my own, I understand the pain of seeing them suffer and also the anger when they make ridiculous or damaging choices.<br />I also identified with the father, Pat Sr, played intensely by Robert DeNiro. Unwilling to accept his own quirks as possible mental illness, he instead calls the oddities his good luck charms and ways to insure success, especially when it comes to his beloved Philadelphia Eagles football team. He realizes toward the end of the movie how his OCD personality may have shaped some of Pat Jr's behavior, and that felt really good to see his \\"grown man\\" tears shed as a father trying to connect with his son in mutual understanding.<br />I will admit that before this movie, I really didn't care much for Bradley Cooper. Although a stunning specimen of a man, his sharp blue eyes projected an arrogance to me further driven home by the characters he played. But, in this movie, it is clearly evident why he received the Oscar nomination for Best Actor (which he really should have won, in my own honest opinion).  The character of Pat, Jr. fast talking, rapid cycling, intensely determined and looking for that Silver Lining-that ending of happiness in the movie of his life he watched unfold on a daily basis was dazzling. It makes me wonder if Bradley may, in fact, have an element of Bi-Polar disorder in his personality. If not, he surely must have grown up around someone who did, because he nailed the part.<br />Jennifer Lawrence's turn as Tiffany awed me. From her expressions to her verbal intensity, she captured a woman teetering on the brink of a depressive edge, yet wanting desperately to be accepted and loved. So desperate, she was willing to lie to the man she loved at first sight in an attempt to pull him close to her. In the scene where she casually spews sports scores and facts before casually popping off the top of a Budweiser, she secured both feminine determination and fitting in as one of the guys to prove her point and left the room speechless. Bravo.<br />Every actor involved in this film demonstrated charisma and delivered top notch performances, Chris Tucker, funny and fast-witted as Danny and Anupam Kher as Dr. Cliff Patel attempting to pull Pat into reality and encouraging him to develop a strategy- all while bonding as a fellow Eagles fan.<br />David O. Russell's adaptation fit perfectly for the big screen at just the right length and development. I enjoyed his changes to the Stevie Wonder songs from both Songbird by Kenny G and Total Eclipse of the Heart by Bonnie Tyler in the novel. The musical changes captured more of what the scene required, even if slightly old school tunes. The rest of the soundtrack is just as appropriate in establishing a background for what the characters are going through at any particular time.<br />Mr. Russell tweaked a deep, emotional novel into something suitable for film. The intricacies in the novel would not have adapted straight to a movie and hold the same interest--it would have been too long and confusing. In addition, the chemistry between the actors involved- especially Bradley and Jennifer- required more fleshing out for the viewing audience. The relationship between Pat Sr. and Pat Jr. needed more substance because, well, it's Robert DeNiro, for Pete's sake...he deserves more from a role and Mr. Russell provided it.<br />Which is why, in this rare instance, I believe the film and the novel marry perfectly. I saw the movie first, then read the novel and the pairing left me with a satisfied feeling.<br />Matthew Quick's fast paced novel about a man suffering some type of mental illness or breakdown is different in several ways than the screenplay. Minor changes such as Pat's surname change from Peoples to Solitano, song differences, and the supporting character roles provide little impact between the screen and novel. However, major changes abound, such as Pat losing 4 years of his memory in the novel rather than 8 months in the movie, the fact that Pat's mental condition is never really defined in the novel, the way Tiffany works out the letters, and the gambling plot in the movie. There are several more; however, none detracted me from either medium to enjoy this story.<br />Written in first person, Mr. Quick wrote Pat's verbiage in an almost frantic/determined tone, and I felt his rapid fire energy. Bradley Cooper handily captured Matthew's intention of this man, Pat, valiantly fighting for his life back, but in a better form, a life with a Silver Lining.<br />So, Fellow Fathomers, if you've not enjoyed Silver Linings Playbook the movie or The Silver Linings Playbook, the novel, I encourage you to do both. The bittersweet tale left me with a fulfilling satisfaction that life doesn't have to be perfect to be beautiful.he characters are going through at any particular time.<br />Mr. Russell tweaked a deep, emotional novel into something suitable for film.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|The Harry Potter Series is wonderful, exciting, and spellbinding. I have loved the series from the beginning, each movie has surpassed the previous and the ending two parts were great. Had to have the complete set!
034554398X|5.0|This third installment is unquestionably most poignant, sometime agonizing, and exhilarating experience so far of this series. The pivotal events in A Storm of Swords seamlessly picks up and builds upon the aftermath of the slaughter and mayhem that occurred just outside the walls of King's Landing. The story follows the ongoing campaigns of the \\"kings\\" who lay claim Westeros and the Lannisters who are desperately trying to take control of seven kingdoms. Tyrion is the only Lannister that I find remotely redeemable but to be truthful, were he a full-sized person he would just be Tywin Lannister II.<br /><br />Following the Blackwater battle, the seven kingdoms are far from a peaceful reconciliation. Stannis Baratheon is defeated yet still plotting with his sorceress priestess, Mellisandre. Rob Stark is vigilantly trying to rally his bannermen in ridding the Tully lands of the Lannisters and uniting the West, yet it a matter of honor will play a critical role in that venture.<br /><br />There is much hope and promise in following Daenery's journey as she forges her way through the Free Cities, building her own army with her three growing dragons at her side. The most intriguing character for me was the enigmatic wild man, Mance Raider, the self-proclaimed king of the North.<br /><br />Descriptive imagery, detailed prosed, and vivid characterizations,A Storm of Swords is truly a great work of literary fiction and will stand the test of time as GRRM's greatest novel. I hope that once completed,  A Song of Ice and Fire will live up to the promise of these first three transformative novels.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|He says that it is one of the best books he has read.  He will re-read it and has passed it on to his brother as well.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I teach sixth grade students and this is definitely the next book we will be reading.<br />I want the students to grow up to be kind people, and this book guides about that concept most perfectly.<br />Kindness, courage, friendship, and character. I want my students to be defined by these concepts, and propel themselves to greatness,<br />A huge thank you to the author for writing the book I will enjoy reading with my students.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I cannot imagine why this book is so popular... I loved Beautiful Creatures, Twilight, so it is certainly not the genre that was a turn off, poor writing, irritating characters, desperate story line.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The new update is NOT a good one.  I've already changed to another app.  I still like the old one better than my new one....wish it would go back the way it was!
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|Once you install decent voice software, this thing rocks! It works very well at reading my PDF and DOC files.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I haven't seen the movie, so I can't compare it.  But the book was great.  I thought it would be depressing, because it was about mental illness.  But quite the opposite.  (I should have taken a clue from the title &#34;silver linings...duh.)  The author really nails the tone of the thoughts and dialogue of the main character.  The rest of the characters are interesting and well developed.  I'm looking forward to more from Matthew Quick.
0375851569|5.0|I got this for my 6-year-old's birthday. We read them nearly every night, they are the favorites! It arrived looking perfect, brand new. Very good quality, exactly what you would expect in a store. Very pleased with this purchase.

B005QBKXOQ|4.0|I love the music listen to it all the time but when i received the product the case had two huge cracks in it.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|Was hoping that it would be more like the old Deep Purple, but it is still has it moments.  You have too listen to it a couple of times to really appreciate.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Seems this series is mostly based onfacts. I am currently reading The 6 wives of Henry VIII and it follows the story to a tee. We<br />love it and the actors and actreses were awesome.
B007X1ZQSU|5.0|You cannot beat getting this if you love Thin Lizzy.  For the price you pay you get this great collection of CD's.
B005LAII08|5.0|Fabulous deal ... came with Blu-ray 3D, a regular Blu-ray, DVD and then a digital copy.  We tried them all except for digital copy and the quality is just stunning.
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|Another great movie.  I knew nothing about it, so the plot was unexpected.  This is one of those movies that deftly displays both comedy and drama in an enjoyable manner.  I am not sure, but I think this is based upon a true story.
0345803507|5.0|I enjoyed the reading. It was a great ending to this trilogy. I would suggest to any reader who enjoy romance kicked up a bit. Read this serious.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Unfortunately for me, I decided to watch this after a late dinner.  I think the movie was actually worth more than 3 stars, but for effect the scenes are very dark and the volume is very low.  I was too sleepy to appreciate it completely.
0099579928|5.0|The book was as good as I thought it would be. I thought it was excellent. What more to be said?
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|I had not heard anything beforehand about this movie.  I loved it.  Wow has she got guts.  She has always been a decent actress, I think.  But, here, she has got guts; her character is completely believable.  What a great story.  It makes you realize how lucky you are, even if you have your own physical difficulties.  At least you can move about and experience most of what life has to offer.  Great movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Batman just rocks period!! This is the best trilogy of the cape crusader ever.  Although, it is different in the aspect of the comic books, Christopher Nolan is a great story teller in putting all three movies pieced together.
0385394233|5.0|I think she has a terrific insight for women in the work place. I found validation for many of the obstacles I faced over the years.<br />True, as she states, not everyone has the good fortune to have the financial recourses to afford luxurious day care help for their children, however, there are many ways to &#34;skin the cat&#34;.<br />It gives women a new perspective on how to achieve in the workplace!
B00000ICD9|5.0|This is a great family movie.  Get the popcorn, turn down the lights, put your sound system on and enjoy.
B00821OX98|4.0|Love it. Starts a lil slow but has a nice twist every time your not thinking there will be one. I will watch every season they come out with.<br /><br />P.S. I live off the grid so having anything free as Amazon movies and Tv, to entertain me is So nice. Thank you Amazon.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My girl loves this app and never gets bored with it. So much to do! This is a favorite of hers.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|What a twist in the end.  It finally brought everything together.  I like how the author wrote it like letters to someone.  It made for an interesting read.
0743270754|4.0|I didn't give it 5-stars which the book's content is worth ten times over -- amazing how Lincoln brought his political rivals onto his governing team and garnered their trust and respect, and even changed their world views.  Took one star away because shipper stuck it in an envelope and sent it. Got banged up on the way.
B005CRQ4OW|1.0|Diary of a wimpy kid is the best book series. It even makes my parent's laugh. Mom and dad like it so much they believe that if the world read it they would be H-O-O-K-E-D. Greg Heffley is me and my cousin Leam's favorite  character ever. My older sister's is Rodrick it regime's her of well her. This book is the best.<br />  Sincerely,<br />  Hannah Locketelled
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I love this series of books! Enough action to satisfy all but the most obsessed reader. Twists, turns, some expected and some not. Start with the first book in the series and simply enjoy.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The drama and the connection between Clary, Jace, and Simon is anticipating!<br />I Can't wait to read the third book!
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Solid story, but when will the sequel come out?  Should have waited for the series to be written before buying.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I read it.  I plowed and dogged through it while on an international flight. I kept wanting to see what all the fuss was about and was disappointed to realize I'd been hoodwinked by a delusional nut case.  The case for spirituality is a contrivance by the sheepels who won't or find it impossible to think for themselves.  However, I applaud Mr. Martel for his success.
B004LWZW24|5.0|If you can suspend your disbelief and sit back and enjoy then this will be a pretty scary movie that you will enjoy. There are some plot holes but I didn't mind honestly. I just enjoyed the creepy atmosphere and was entertained with the movie overall.
B004QYTRRS|1.0|Have not been able to complete the download - it hung up about 1/3 of the way in and cannot be restarted.
B00CDFWJIG|2.0|I was so disappointed by this movie as the previews made it look amazing. While I wasn't a big fan of the books because I felt they dragged on, they at least had a good story line with a lot of promise in the box office. Unfortunately the story was completely changed into something with less depth and not nearly as much heart. There were some great actors involved (Emma Thompson was the star, hands down) and some not-so-great actors (I just didn't feel their characters). I almost walked out of the theatre, but kept expecting it to get better at any moment. Unfortunately, it didn't. It felt like a low-budget high school production.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|All of the  movies were great.  I like action pack movies and this is a good one to watch of the Dark Knight
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A good read, but the movie was better. The book clarified some things, and gave some dimension to the relationships between the characters, but it was a little long-winded and muddled in spots.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a great game, but I have to work for the game to get anything done. I promote their game (hence this review) to get the money to keep playing.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Fast and accurate. I use it each morning so I know what kind of clothes to choose. Easier than staying up late to wait for the weather man.
B007R108WA|1.0|If you enjoy violence you might find this movie interesting, I turned if off about ten minutes into the movie..
B00328G4XY|5.0|What more can I say about Jimi Hendrix?  A world class guitarist in his own time.  No one can touch his unique style of playing electric guitar.  I cannot imagine what more he would have achieved in his life if he was still with us.  A must have album for any Jimi Hendrix fan.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Fans of SK will appreciate this book. Real events are mixed/melded with created events seamlessly and once you get past the first couple hundred pages it gets difficult to put the book down.<br />Check it out today.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I will be going back to get all of India's music, it is soothing to my soul! Love her music!
B001HN6EF4|5.0|The quality of the product is great. The game is very funny to play with friends, I really recommend to try it!
B00000ADG2|5.0|This CD was near and dear to my heart, I misplaced it and needed to refuel my heart and mind!
B007N31YH0|5.0|What can I say? For overall enjoyment this film ranks right up there with Some Like it Hot, In the Heat of the Night and Patton.
B003EYVXXW|3.0|I thought the movie had good performances, It just had a cheesey story, and lack of ation made it very long!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|We studied is on Wed. night at church.<br />It was very easy to read until we got to the<br />last part.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely and would be interested in knowing more about the lives of Jaimie. Lily, Rose and Paddy.  The conclusion was surprising and satisfying.  I would recommend this book.
0060245867|5.0|Bought this book for a baby shower. We were supposed to bring a book we loved as a child to help build the baby's library. This book did not disappoint, it was hardback and in great condition.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's really fun. I like it and my lil girl like this game.  We play it all the time. I will recommend it to anyone.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|We all play video games. Sometimes we even do it together:) But for the family, watching this movie<br />we a treat that allowed us to talk afterwards about the games of yesterday and today and the many advancements<br />in technology. Thank you Disney! Thank you Amazon!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|It is slim sleek hard and nice for the price and it lets you stand it sideways at any angle.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|More adult and grown up Timerlake mirrors Robin Thicke without the cocaine innuendos, does attempt to replace said innuendos with marihuana use.  Love both artist. This album I'd kewl though emulates the length of future sounds love boxxx without divided tracks. So the average track is about 10 minutes long
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is great. it does take patience if you want to keep it free but that gives you time to do other games.  it recharges fairly quick and will notify you when it has.  the objects are not always in the same place which keeps it fresh and challenging.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting take on the earth's becoming unlivable.  Some interesting twists and turns--some unexpected.  I usually don't like science fiction that much, but I really enjoyed this book.
0767821769|5.0|Awesome movie... no flaws. Arrived quickly. Thank you! I keep forgetting what DVDs I want when I search for them, but I always know once I remember, I can find the movie I want!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great app would recommend to anyone. Predictive search is great, a lot of languages for those international folks like me! And flow is just awesome swipe is light years behind now. Only one bug I have noticed is that occasionally when I press the space bar it kicks me out of the app and I have to reenter!
B008JEJPSC|5.0|My wife took my daughter to a high school production of Annie and my three year old daughter couldn't start talking about it.  So it only seemed to make sense to let her see the original of it.  And she absolutely loves it.  I like the sing-a-long feature and am looking forward to when she can read to learn the words along with it.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|This is a great story of someone who might well be a genius. I think there is more to the story than we've been given in the book and that makes me the more curious and interested. Early in the book there is a discussion of magic and, for me, this might circle back to reappear later in a different form.<br />  An exapple for me is what William mis-tells regarding the science. He reports being intrigued by the inventing they did in science. The book he learned from, though, is clear on what science is and isn't. It's not about inventing, that's applied science (engineering.) Science is about discovery about how our universe works through observation and the scientific method of discovery: OThERR: observation, theorizing, experimentation, reporting results and repeating the process. It's about collecting data. Perhaps that's a fine point.<br />  The radios. That got me early on, too. Motors in radios? The many radios his family and friends had that they could scrounge through? There are no motors in any radio I've ever pulled apart. In the cassette players often a part of radios, yes. But those radios are expensive compared to the transistor radios I imagine being affordable to families that poor and in that time, the 80's and 90's to the early 2000's. And simple radios can not (to the best of my knowledge) be simply reversed to become transmitters. The devices are not what's called, \\"reciprocal.\\" Speakers and microphones, though, are. Though they are optimized for their special function, a speaker making not all that good a microphone, etc.<br />  He's adamant that a big incandescent light bulb must have AC to light, but that's not true. An incandescent light bulb is only a resistive wire that gets hot and glows when (enough) current is forced through it. It will work on AC and DC, both.<br />  And the Bosch bicycle dynamo. It produces 12 volts (nominally...depending on how fast it's rotating, to a point) but it is capable of only about 3 Watts of power. This laptoprequires 14 so it couldn't run that. A bike lamp is about all it can handle. So claims of powering more than that--and dreams of powering a water pump which requires serious power...lets say, at least 200 Watts and even that wouldn't do much, are just fancy anywhere near this level of machine--run full into the stuff if \\"magical realism,\\" which I think the writers are toying with.<br />  Some of this is believable but more doesn't pass the sniff test.<br />  But William's accomplishments are extraordinary, considering what he knew and the hardships he faced...and the cultural taboos hinted at, which he says apply to women but I think will also whip back and slap the men, too, in their own time and way, always limiting what someone might do, or wish or imagine he/she could do.<br />  And of wind and wind turbines. That's what I do for work...small wind, in Vermont. I couldn't learn much about the winds in Malawi. The two or so months I spent there suggested there wasn't much wind. The most recent wind reports from the Blantyre airport show that they have more or less a similar wind regime to what I have at my home in the Champlain Valley...not much, frankly, and what we do have is unreliable. Resorts on the lake in his vicinity, though they offer sailing, do not report windy periods to vacationers. I suspect it's pretty safe to sail there, i.e. not much wind most of the time. Wind at my place can be punchy, and winds like that destroy wind machines, even those that are quite well built. Entire companies with good engineers have made wind turbines, even small ones, that suffered from fatal flaws and destroyed themselves.<br />  I can't imagine that his rotor is well balanced, for example--Also, his turbine has no way to regulate/cap the rotational speed of the rotor if the wind actually comes up and blows one night...as wind has wont to do with no warning. William never mentions this aspect and it's critical. Had he solved that natty problem, his accomplishment wouldhave been the more astonishing and well worth telling in his book. Such a wind, or perhaps any real wind, would have torn the entire thing apart, turbine and tower, as it sped up and sped up and ran away with itself. I balance rotors carefully. It's a big deal, as, too, is a way to turn the machine out of the wind. How did the turbine follow the wind? Wind rarely blows from just one direction. So, again, there is something in this story that reads to me more like a kind, enjoyable, dreamlike fantasy than strict fact. Could it run badly for a short time? Yes. I'd like to know more about that. It would have been very inconvenient and I suspect it was. That's interesting. What was living like that like? My own early experience with our turbine is now a series of hilarious stories of the way it worked ...and didn't. ...You should have seen the lights and heard the vacuum cleaner before we bought the batteries.... The whole thing was just nuts.<br />  So, I'm suspicious. I think there is too much left out, too much stretched too thin and too much hinted at that I want to know regarding the realities of their lives. All in all, the story is engaging and, especially because of what I believe are distortions, draws someone like me to want to see behind the curtain. I think that would be even more interesting.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|This has been the best book that I have read so far. It was funny and I liked the characters.  Sometimes I even laughed out loud.

B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Time Killer, by Todd Thiede, is not a book for those who get queasy at the site or mention of blood. A serial killer carries out a crazed vendetta against people who, in his mind, have wasted his time. He leaves a trail of victims across Illinois and Indiana that spans a 25-year period.<br /><br />Max Larkin, a 29-year-old, fast-rising detective on the small Rockton, Illinois police force, is assigned the hot case after a family is murdered in the normally sleepy town. He is given a new female partner, Jessie Fairlane, before going to the scene of the murder - a move that doesn't please Max.  The story revolves around the dynamics between Max and Jessie as they close in on the killer who is always masked and wearing a business suit.  His MO includes leaving victims with missing fingers and writing messages in blood, warning others not to waste his time.<br /><br />Mr. Thiede is a gifted storyteller. The plot is intriguing, moves rapidly, and includes sufficient surprises to keep the reader entertained and on his toes.  I would rate the storyline and characters developed by the author as five star.  However, I felt the dialogue was wordy and sounded unnatural at times, and another run-through by the editor would have helped clean up some minor, yet repeating, punctuation problems.<br /><br />This was his first, but I expect we will see more Todd Thiede novels.  At least, I hope so.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Well written and with lots of practical applications. A must read for those wanting to get into the world of aquaponics
159420229X|3.0|I read this book to see what the methods were for increasing one's memory. While helpful to some, it may not be for everyone. I realized that I did not need the tricks listed in this book. But it may help someone else remember everyday things.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is a great game....it is a good time passing game if you are waiting at a doctor's office or just something to do if your bored...
B001IA46D8|4.0|I find the musical styling of this U.K. group to be entertaining and enduring. I recommend this album to pop fans.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good story line..A lot of sex sex sex. If you are looking for a good book to read with a lot of sex in it this would be it..I am reading it but I t hink this second one will be about enough for me...
B003V40SGS|4.0|I really loved this throwback to classic science fiction. I know this film did not do well in its original release but the special effects were great for the time in which it was made. I liked it.
0739366408|5.0|In a somewhat cerebral take (as cerebral as zombie stories can be) on the zombie apocalypse; this is a fun book.  It has a very pragmatic and/or militaristic view on the whole scenario.  Just what would the world do in response to walking dead numbering in the millions if not billions?<br /><br />There are a few cheesy and gratuitous parts in the audio book, where voice over actors don't do it much justice.  However, on balance the book is solid.  As other reviewers have noted, it is quite short and could have been much more expansive.<br /><br />If you like the zombie genre you will certainly enjoy this one.
B000KGGB2A|4.0|This album introduced me to Take That and I have not regretted it. I look forward to more art from this group.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love the series, hope it's around for a long time.  It does not beed to be politically correct, it i a drama.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|I found this movie to be a great continuation of the Firefly series. I was disappointed that the show was canceled. I was happy when I got to see the characters together again.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great series, hope they stick around for a long time.  This does not need to be politically correct, it's a drama.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Got this movie within days of ordering but only just watched it last Fri. so wanted to wait to make sure it was in working order, which it is!<br />Thank you!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|this is a good book for women in the work world. It at moments made me sad and frustrated with the disparity between women and men in the work force but I also felt motivated to continue on and moving forward.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|The blueray recording adds another dimension to what was already an unforgettable visual experience of epic proportions, made real by a consummate performance by the one and only Robert Duvall. Do not miss this award winning series.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|My mother recommended this book to me. She said that she laughed and cried, and experienced a range of emotions with the characters. Well, so did I. This book is a great read. At first I expected a romance, but it is so much more. It is a little slow to get into at first, but definitely worth it. I LOVED IT!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive to play. It is a little bit harder to adjust to on the kindle vs a cell phone but it is still a great game!
B000FC130E|5.0|Great story. No question Neal cranks out a good story. He's got more than a few. I'd sure like more of under London.<br />Never say never...right.
B008HK3S9K|4.0|This is a very nice pouch for your Kindle so that it gets some extra protection while in your bag/purse.  The high density foam has a very nice feel - kinda like a memory foam.  The inner lining is very luxurious and soft.  I actually find this design prettier in person than in the picture  - I got the Lola Floral/Mulberry one.  It is quite sturdy and the price is right.  It does add more bulk, but it also makes it so you can carry your naked kindle safely.  If you already have a case for your kindle, it would be overkill to put it in this envelope as well...also it may be a bit of a tight fit.  But if you like your kindle to be as light as possible and just need protection during transport, then this may be your ticket.  This product is attractive and well made.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a movie that even children over the age of 10 can enjoy. The music was very good and the voices of the actors was surprisingly good considering that you don't expect Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) to sing. A delightful surprise!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|it was wonderful!  the actors were exceptional...should have won more awards but too many other films overlording...I loved Jaimie,knock it off!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read lots of NDEs and this one was different because it was a bit more scientific.  Dr A. gave more evidence than anyone else that I have read.  Most spiritual things cannot be made understood to people who operate totally on scientific things.  I enjoyed his intreptations and philosophy.  He is non biased in his religious beliefs which makes the evidence more believable to even skeptics.  I believe what he says and I applaud him for his courage.  Kaye Soderquist
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I bought this book a while ago and left it on my Kindle carousel to read later. Finally got around to reading it. Wish I had read it sooner. Great book with a lot of good info.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the best bible app out there. I like that you can read different versions and that they have small studies you can do. Also its nice to be able to bookmark your place and come back later.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Won't connect to my Facebook though. Other than that, I enjoy playing. The lives take a little long to load but it's a small inconvenience for a free game.
1589795474|5.0|This book is a must-read for every capitalist. Getting rich...not sexy. Being rich...sexy. I recommend with the highest regards. seriously
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is great for casual play, especially if you like the movies.  The game play is that same quest real time based passive play style that seems prevalent in the app store.  You get a mission, the components of the mission take x minutes, then you get access to more missions and stuff to put on the map.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Graphics are cool, feed the dinosaurs and you see them eat.<br />-Missions keep you coming back for more.<br />-You get to be creative and design the park as you see fit.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Not super challenging<br />-You can get ahead of yourself in the missions.  I had to sell my triceratops because by the time I got the quest to feed it, it was already maxed.
1451695195|5.0|An enlightening look at a controversial question by someone with a scientific education.  Gives hope to many who may think they need &#34;proof&#34; to a degree.
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|This one is most certainly for the long time fans of the band.  It makes the perfect swansong for the group in terms of its musical output.
1451648537|5.0|I've never read a book this thick that didn't bore me at one place or another. This book hasn't.<br />Jobs is such a complex person that I doubt many writers could have made you feel as though you knew him like Isaacson has.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|He's back and better than ever. Recommend the deluxe release with the bonus tracks.  Bowie fans are going to be stoked.
0345803507|4.0|I am just beginning to read this final book. Can't wait to see what transpires. I have the feeling I will wish for more.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|An enjoyable read with clear reasons why many succeed and many don't . I highly recommend this as a must read.
0345803493|4.0|Piqued my curiosity. Enjoyed how the storyline kept making me want to read more. Found out that so many people I know have read it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great show and I am hooked on it.  Will be disappointed when I finish up the 3rd season.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I usually don't choose nonfiction books but this one was thoroughly entertaining! A great read.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I await each new season eagerly.  Matt Smith is a great Dr. Who. I suspect some of the former characters will resurface in the next episodes. The writers are great.
0440245206|4.0|This book was a gift for my sister.  I'm not a big fan on D. Steel, but she enjoyed the book immensely.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Tarantino at his best. Plenty of action,( if not predictable at times.)All in all a great movie. Loved it.<br /><br />0 Loved it.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great story about time travel with an unseen twist.  Both main characters played their parts convincingly.  Sometimes you need to watch these more than once to get it as the time travel twist can be confusing.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Great deal, Great price, needed to update from VHS and it arrived quickly. Now my collection is complete and so much easier to watch.
B004GJYROG|5.0|My daughter used to watch this when she was younger.  She asked for it for her 21st birthday as she missed the movie.  It did not disappoint even now as a grown.  Plus she got a few more of the jokes.  This is a great movie for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I got it the only thing that is weird are some of the missions are complicated. but it is a good app
B00APUQT7I|5.0|usually the third one is the charm however the forth is just as good as the first three..... a must see if you like the ice age saga
B00AQA94M4|4.0|I don't know if they used all of their juice up when they did the Scarecrow Trilogy but this is not quite the same level as those albums - The metal opera had more catchy music and grooves than this album - I own and enjoy all of the Avantasia albums and even most of the Edguy albums, but this falls short - it is not a bad album, but if you have listened to the Scarecrow Trilogy you will leave this album wanting that something more - those melodies that you couldn't stop singing - those songs that burrow into your brain - they are not here - this is listenable, but i can honestly say I would skip this album on the player unless I just wanted background music while working on something else -
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|i have yet to be disappointed by cut the rope games and this one surely delivers another great adventure with Om Nom
1401324649|1.0|This is the most boring book I've read in years.<br />I finished it for the sake of finishing, not because I enjoyed it.<br />I don't recommend it and I'm sure you'll be able to find a better book in which to spend your money.<br />It just seems to drag and it's not entertaining at all. Stay away from it
1423140591|5.0|You don't need to be a young adult to enjoy this book or the others in this series.  Ric Riordan has some good books along the same line as this one.  Have read them all.  Can't wait for the next one to come out in October.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This is a great game I love it ME Kate and my athoer horses Chile and  Kara  r having a great time in the stable  you can  jump ride your horses all around the stable and have a great time.But I think that they shood add breeding.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. The graphics are awesome on my Kindle HD and the gameplay is smooth.......that is until the gameplay becomes beset with glitches. It is extremely frustrating when I am in the middle of a really good run and end up dying when the glitches start (and at least 3 shut downs). A little battery intensive as well. I would really give 3.5 stars but option not offered. Well, back to the game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a really challenging game that gets you to collect items and coins. I love playing it because I don't really like any other games. I also like the way it changes it's theme and puts on hunts like the Easter egg hunt and the Tokyo girls.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This is an excellent batman story by Moore. Very chilling and dark story involving the Joker. We are even treated to a bit of insight into the origin of the Joker's madness and attitude. Highly recommend any batman fan to give this a read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is a must have! I love how every month the subway surfers are in a new place and it really gets you to think fast. Subway Surfer is also a good brain game. I have it on all my electronics(:
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sheryl Sandberg gets it right and gives practical ideas for real change. Thank you!  Reading this book will definitely change my actions in the future.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This game is good but the boards are to exspensive.especially the lowrider<br />But other wise the game is really really awesome
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I use this as a template for my life. She distills the best teachings from many self help gurus into practical ways to include into your life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The most awesome book ever :)<br />I loved so much I could not stop reading great book<br />Read it you will love it
0439813786|5.0|Very interesting read.  Don't let the length of this book fool you, it will read very quickly because there are a great number of pictures to enhance the story.  Would highly recommend this book, as well as another book by the same author called Wonderstruck.  Both are excellent books to read for any age.
0896898288|5.0|I love this book...the diagrams of the quilt blocks are clear, easy to read and understand.<br />The letters from the wives are wonderful...a unique book of history.
B000002U9L|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy the soundtrack just as much. I must admit, I bought this for myself and listen to it more times than I can count. Very nostalgic & fun.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I really, really hope this is not the last we hear from Harry Hole.  Nesbo has created a very interesting protagonist who has tried to rehabilitate himself with varying degrees of success.  The mysteries are well developed and satisfying.  I would hate to see them end.
B0025CS2GU|4.0|I've seen it at least 4 or 5 times, but my wife had never seen it.  $2.99 was pretty expensive to rent something that was out of date for as long as this is, but it was convenient, so I guess you pay for that part of it don't you... :)
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I bot this for an easter present for my kids. They loved it and it's a good movie too. The whole family enjoyed it you won't be disappointed.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|There are some strong parrallels between \\"Iron Man 3\\" and the box office strong but much criticized \\"Spider-man 3\\".  Fans of Spidey (rightly) pointed out how frequently Spidey was shown without mask, with partial mask, or with the focus being on so much of Tobey Maguire.  As Peter Parker is Spider-man and Tobey Maguire played Parker we saw a lot of Maguire, too much for the fans in fact when they believed they should have been seeing Spider-man more than they did.  So too in IM3 where Robert Downey, Jr. plays Tony Stark (who famously says \\"I am Iron Man\\") and we see a lot (underscored) of Tony Stark, and I mean a lot.  Is he in his armor?  Sure, quite a bit actually.  It's just that it's in various arrays of armor with faceplate up, the suit coming half off, the suit on in pieces, or the suit partially shredded.  Getting Downey, Jr. was a coup to play Stark and the best thing for the Iron Man films but he is here in the movie too much balanced against being in his armor too little.  And that's too bad because the film suffers from this push to expose Downey and get him as much face time as possible as opposed to focusing on some cool and extended shots of him inhabiting his armor.<br /><br />Also whereas Spider-man 1 & 2 were brightly lit and colored 3, while still quite bright, toned the colors down and brought in the metaphorical and lighted-effects of darkness.  IM3, if different, is different only in tone (a grittier all around feel) and that many more of its scenes occur at night or in darkened places.  It is like having an artist that you really enjoy drawing your comic only to have another artist step in whose style is so different that it changes the comic book tonally.  That is what has happened in this movie.  IM2 was rather heavy and dense in its themes and story but the lighted qualities drew you in and kept you interested.  In IM3 you may find that you just want some scenes to end or for it to move back into daytime lighting.<br /><br />Spider-man 2 threw us the curveball that Peter Parker could lose his powers if he was morally conflicted about being Spider-man and then 3 showed us his slide into becoming drunk with power.  IM3 mixes these a bit with Tony Stark using Iron Man as a real and metaphorical crutch, suffering flashbacks and panic attacks from the events of the Avengers alien attack and being briefly and momentarily in another universe.  This is an interesting and organic connection to the previous movie, with PTSD effects fouling up Stark's mental capacities and negatively effecting his choices or causing him to run into his suit to have his body scanned to see if he's dying.  I found that the story-arc around this was actually quite smart except that it didn't just ostracize him from his friends and Pepper Potts but it also ostracized the audience as well; the characters aren't happy and their personalities aren't fleshed out in this iteration as they were in the first and especially second movies.  Stark's accomplishment, if you want to call it that by end of movie (he doesn't \\"need\\" the Iron Man armors anymore the way that he did throughout the movie--that's all I'll say about that), leaves the viewer at movie's end with unsatisfied questions not as to what will happen next but as to what exactly did all of the quick resolutions really mean.  The brash cock-surity of Stark, something that drew the filmgoer in previously, appears to be in peril at movie's conclusion.<br /><br />If IM1 & 2 were more stories about redemption and realizing and holding onto meaningful relationships IM3 is about overcoming adversity and hoping to hell that you're relationships will just work out.  Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, who was Tony's righthand woman and mental/ emotional sparring partner and equal in the first two movies here is a worn, \\"why am I doing this?\\" tough-gal for part of the film and a damsel in distress for another part and finally the powerful heroine by movie's end (though she still needs to be saved); none of this felt fresh and IMO she never came across as Tony's equal here (she was his superior) so the relational aspect wasn't as satisfying not nearly by half.  Favreau, the previous director of the first two installments and who has given way to new director Shane Black (go back, Jon, go back!), gets a lot more screen time as former bodyguard now promoted to Stark Industries head of security.  Cheadle, in a revamped suit dubbed \\"Iron Patriot\\", also gets more screen time.<br /><br />But what of all of the Iron Man armors?  Are there a lot in the film?  Yes, a ton.  And you don't really get a good look at any of them but a brief highlight moment of a few seconds for about 5 of them outside of the main suit.  As far as this fan is concerned that was a complete waste of armor and a very unsatisfying finale to the film.  Notice that in Spider-man 3 he dons more than one suit...but at least they all get decent screentime.<br /><br />You may have noticed that I haven't spent a lot...or any time on the villains of the story.  For those in the know there are elements of the Extremis storyline in here; for those who don't know Extremis manipulates a person's brain's ability to amplify physical energy and regenerative ability.  Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) is using this biological technology to their own end and an Osama bin Laden type of terrorist called The Mandarin is also on hand and provides one of the film's few surprising, and humorist, plot twists.  In Spider-man 3 the way that the villains were presented and jumbled it made for too many in the stew.  I will give credit to this film for having several villains and meshing and balancing them out nicely.  Still, I wish that they were more outlandish.  Where's Mickey Rourke's Whiplash when you need him?<br /><br />This film wasn't horrible by any stretch of the imagination.

B000VMBXNA|2.0|A funny but a story with many insights. It is a pleasure to<br />read it shows how at any age or circumstance the ability to<br />loss oneself in a good book is a pleasure that one looks<br />forward to. Charming and the perfect ending.
B000OVLINI|3.0|Good reading  kept your interest but at times was hard to keep track  of all the characters being introduced in the story.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|It's not only his sushi which is amazing but also Jiro's attitude towards his work. The documentary was beautifully made. I love it.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great Movie, bought it for my grandson..I watched it with him over, and over and over again- and I never minded it !
030758836X|1.0|I tried really hard to like this book.<br /><br />As I slogged through the first half of the book with it's endless minutiae seemingly taking the reader nowhere  - I thought to myself \\"it has to get better\\"<br />Despite my misgivings I allowed myself to relax a bit into the second half as the story picked up - the characters gained some dimension and the plot seemed to deepen.<br /><br />This is when I should have stopped...<br /><br />This is one of the worst endings I have come across in a LONG time! I really should get a refund on the time I wasted reading this book.<br />I find it really hard to believe that the characters would make the choices they eventually did...<br /><br />Sad , waste of time - wish I had read the reviews here before I bought it. Can't understand why some give it such good reviews
1442337966|5.0|I watched the movie &#34;The Secret&#34; and bought this for myself to listen to when I drive. It makes me feel re-charged, and helps keep me on track.
0762434260|5.0|Yes, it comes in several pieces and each fits nicely, no wobbling.  The great thing about this is that it is affordable enough for Harry Potter enthusiasts without breaking the bank compared to actual replica wands, and plastic is sturdier than resin when dropped.  It works well in costume parties and for display purposes, but I don't think it is intended for horse play or be given to small children because it won't hold up with brunt force during play and it would definitely break apart.  It is better for the avid Harry Potter fans who wants it to be a part of their collection, and just holding it up practicing spells in the comfort of their bedrooms.
B00821OX98|5.0|Hooked. Very exciting. One of the best shows going. I can't wait to see what happens in the next season.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|Sister by Rosamund Lupton, is one of the most extraordinary books I have read. It chronicles the story of Beatrice as she tries to find out what is behind the death of her sister, Tess. Not once does she ever stray from this determination, despite being ignored, fobbed off and treated as though she was becoming as `mad' as Tess was, when she committed suicide.<br />As the story unfolds, we understand more and more about the sister's relationship, as Beatrice is forced to examine herself and how she relates to others. Rather than being told from the usual police point of view, the whole story is from Beatrice's point of view. The telling of the story centres around a letter Beatrice writes to her dead sister and therefore changes from the present, to the past and back again. In her stark prose, Ms Lupton evokes the intense emotion felt by Beatrice, her fianc&eacute; and her mother, without resorting to platitudes or clich&eacute;s, making it easy for the reader to become emotionally involved in the story.<br />One reviewer on the book cover describes the book as `where crime fiction and literature coincide', which is a description I totally agree with. Whilst this read is not an adrenaline rush, there are still the elements of mystery and surprise that crime readers love and the ending has a twist that I confess I didn't see coming.<br />A highly recommended e-thriller read.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really like this game...it's a lot of fun...would be even more fun if it didn't crash every time I tried visiting friends....well assuming I have any it crashes when I try to invite them as well but loads back up with no issues...hope this problem gets fixed really soon...
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun. I am definitely addicted to playing it. My friends like it too.
0345803507|5.0|Great book.  Only half way thru though.  But so far, so good.  Great book so far. Dont want it to end!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Best piece of Zombie literature i have ever come across! There is a reason this is being made into a major motion pictures. A great read that will have you stuck in your seat/couch/bed/whatever till the very end!!
B00A8OQBD8|5.0|I love foals. this album is great! took a while to get here, but worth the wait! wish they included the MP3 download for the price, but I'll just steal it off the internet anyway.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive....hard to put down!  FUN FUN FUN! My son and I both play all the time!
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|This is  the  Deluxe edtion of  this  Cd.  Which  is a lot  better than  the  Deluxe  Ver<br />that  I picked up of  his  2010--release--&#34;Dream  Attic&#34;.  Richard's  playing  is  more<br />fluent,  Maybe  with having  Buddy  Miller as  a producer  had something  to do with<br />that.  ---So if  your a fan, or  a gutiar player--You should have  this one  and of<br />course--&#34;Shoot out the Lights&#34;--in your  cd  Collection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A quick page turner. A must read for all the people out there in a relationships. Great gift for a reader.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I  really  like this more than  the 2010  release of  &#34;Valley  of  Neptune&#34;.<br />Of  course the Playing is  great, --with  the period with  Billy  Cox, &<br />Buddy  Miles, and some with Larry Lee and one  with  Lonnie  Youngblood.<br />So--Yes-it is a little more  Soulful with  killer  groves.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I finished this book in two days. And I flipping loved it so much,I couldn't put it down there was so much drama and back and forth you really didn't know how it was going to end it was amazing. I most defiantly going to buy the second book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an amazing way to past the time with challenges constantly being updated theirs always a new twist perfect
B00005ASHM|5.0|I bought this used and was a little skeptical for fear of scratches on the disc.  When it arrived there wasnt even a speck of dust on the cover or the disc.  After playing it all the way through there wasnt a slight skip!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I subscribe to Showtime, so I have seen the entire series as it aired.  I gave this boxed set to a friend, as a gift, and both she and her husband loved it.  In fact,  I don't know of anyone that doesn't like &#34; Homeland.&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When someone ask me what to read this is always my first recommendation. I love love love this book. The story line is unpredictable and it keeps you guessing until the very end. I don't know how Colleen Hoover does it but she is brilliant.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I wanted to see where the story goes, believe it or not it does have a story line, which is quite good.  Probably will get the next one also.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I first started this book, I had to put it aside.  I didn't realize its characters were struggling with cancer.  It was too close to home as I am battling stage 4 cancer myself.  But about a month later, I was looking for something to read and went back to it.  I loved the dialogue and the characters and just couldn't put it down.  As difficult as it was emotionally to read at some points, the characters just carried me through.  I don't hang around with many 16-year-olds but I'd love to meet some as insightful as these.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The shield was engrossing, ironic, at times funny, suspenseful and worth watching a second time which I'm doing with pleasure.
B0094K20FK|4.0|&#34;Revenge is a dish best served cold and it is so very cold in outer space&#34; The interplay of the characters was excellent and everything was overplayed just to the right level, never over the top.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's so much more easier than playing on my home computer. I love the way you just touch the aces and they move right over.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Easily identify with the children characters in this movie.  I was a Goony and a nerd before those words were ever used.  Chunk is the best i had more than one friend while I was growing up that was just like him.  Sit down suspend your grown up mind for a couple of hours and have a little fun.  Superior movie for the kids they will love how good always wins over evil and the bad guys and girl get caught in the end.  Watch it or buy it or both.  Great family fun!!!
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Not so much favor for the movie.  Too slow, too sepia toned, too heavy-handed.  The story was a light, adventure tale. The book was fun, creative, and innovative for its time.  The movie almost the total opposite.<br /><br />Plus, the packaging was an padded envelope.  The movie case arrived broken. The disks were not damaged.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|More challenging.  Not that the other cut the ropes weren't, it's just evolved.  Fun every time without being frustrating. Worth more than $1
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Okay, I truly believe that EVERY family, truth be told, has its own brand of crazy. Mine sure does. This is a movie that deals with family issues and mental illness and romance all bundled up in a happy, sad story with a GREAT ending. It is REAL and relevant. I saw it twice at the theatre and have watched it three times since I got it from Amazon. Remember the wonderful feeling you had when the original Karate Kid ended and you walked out of the movie with tears and a smile? This is like that, only better. :)
B00846REIS|5.0|Well written - great book.  Story similar to Shades of Grey - but writing is better - and a little less of the S&M.  Really enjoyed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I purchased this game as a Christmas gift (I shop early). I am sure my son will love it. A+++
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love the point system great details either the kindle fire. I liked the idea that this game will go on and on without ending and free too! Why not.<br /><br />Kkkkkk
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|it sucks okay so do not download it sp if it pops up on the screen don't do anything about it just say no like to drugs
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I really like this artist.  I think this is his best CD so far.  I have since bought more copies for friends and family.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Every single page had my eyes glued! This is the shortest I've ever taken to read a book. So amazing
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|History with a Stephen King twist to it makes a very entertaining novel. Leaves you wondering if the coulda, woulda, shoulda format fits.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|glad I bought the whole season it was definitely well worth it. going to buy the second season as soon as I can
1400067820|5.0|Anti Fragile - things that gain from disorder - follows on from his &#34;The Black Swan&#34; which dealt with unpredictable events - like the Fukushima disaster. This book looks at ways to mitigate the damage from such events - but also a lot lot more including reference to the banking crisis and how our society favors (economically) the &#34;tawkers&#34; over the doers. It is a very (very, very) serious book and covers 25 chapters each of 2 to 5 (and sometimes 9 or 10) subheadings. Colorfully (but studiously) written and discusses many aspects of making our lives less fragile and therefore more resistant to Black Swans. While I do not agree with some of his viewpoints (but only a very few) I recommend this book and author very highly to those with an interest in this subject. The book includes a bibliography of over 500 articles and books.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Loved this set.  Great interviews and stories from the whole history of the band!  Learned alot about some of the early members of The Eagles.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|It's just another matching game to acquire items. These kinds of games are great when you have a few minutes to waste.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Didn't think this was one of the better 007 movies , bit slow and seemed not as intriguing as other Bond movies.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I have seen and used others and this is one of the best out there. If you like hitting some keys then pick up this app.
0060987464|5.0|Marilyn Manson has been my idol scince the 3rd grade, im so glad I have been finally able to read his book. it was a fantastic book :) its a little flimsy, be careful, the pictures fall out
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I am a huge fan of the series . I found the blu-ray edition to be of excellent quality. Well done.
B000002IP1|5.0|Love, love, love Phil Collins.  Great variety/mix of songs. Was very pleased that It was Ripped and I was able to immediately download to my computor and MP3.  Instant music!
B0050OMJIW|5.0|I read this book based on the recommendation of a family member and sincerely loved every moment of it. The whole underlying concept and application of 'catch 22' is delightfully witty and humorous, and has been made even more so by being perfectly penned by Joseph Heller. An absolute must read!
B007SGM084|5.0|I love Christian and his fifty shades. This is my fifth time reading the  entire trilogy. I can't wait to see how ELJ follows this arousing read.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I have always thought about what it would be like to use a write-up calculator. Instead of pressing buttons, I can just write! Genius idea!
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I seen this show outdoors, up front, on a perfect night in the Twin Cities. This video really brought back the memories of the great time I had. A must buy for any Rush fan!
B00785P2QC|2.0|I Played Virtual City, And Enjoyed It. I WaA Disappointed As I Started Into This One. The Game Moves Too Slow, And Wants You To Post To Facebook When Anything Happens.
B00005MP58|5.0|Great movie and great delivery service! I have only had it for about a month and have watched it twice!!! That is 12 hours of great content!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Very simple to use, I've tried a few others and this one seems to just work. Helpful in many situations.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Pretty cool game. It is very close to playing online. I would recommend the downlaod. The tiles are not extremely small.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|My son loves this movie. He watches it over and over.  The series just gets better and better in his opinion!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Since they put the carousel the gestures don't work so you cannot see other books or even change pages. Very stupid mistake.
1932907009|5.0|I was referred to this book. I regret not a penny used to purchase. It's a writer's bible for sure. Delivered on time and in new condition.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|My Kindle was a xmas present. I am in a wheelchair and was afraid that my Kindle would fall off my lap as I moved around. This case solves that problem. It is padded, so it does not slip on my lap. It also let me recharge while in the case...and it sets up open so I can read or listen to music hands free. Thank you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think its so cool but I think there needs to be some updates so yeah but sometimes its supper fun and awesome again creators it can use some updates most deffennetly
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|This was an enjoyable read even if the exercises didn't yield extraordinary results. It's a feel-good book, which one can interpret in a spiritual way, regardless of religious affiliation which is wonderful :)
1426209584|5.0|This was the best book of the year for me. Its photos, its illuminating text and the excellent presentation style blew me away! The content provides a fabulous insight into the incredible ordeal of the photographers trying to find and photograph the courtship rituals of the beautiful birds of paradise in New guinea. The text is easy to read, gives a fine introduction into modern taxonomy and evolutionary thinking. it's a wonderful book and a great holiday present!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had this watch for a week now.  Came in original Seiko packaging with instruction book and warranty cards...the watch does look much better than the pictures here.  Maybe I'm one of the &#34;lucky&#34; ones, but I'm not having any issues so far.  The watch hasn't gained or lost any time over 7 days.  I can't speak to the power reserve, because I only take it off to shower.  The lume is always visible in complete darkness, and the watch is virtually silent.  With some different bands, this watch could be worn with just about anything.<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant to order this because the reviews, though mostly positive, seemed like it could be an all or nothing proposition.  I've owned many Seikos and all have worked great, but this is my first automatic.  So far I'm perfectly happy with my purchase, but I'll update this if any issues arise in the future.  Mine was sold and fulfilled by Amazon...
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A truly well written thriller.  I came into it without knowing much of the story, so I was I really taken aback by the twists and turns.  It is well crafted, the characters are believable and the voices well executed.  It surely made me pass the time, all of the few it took me to read it.  I just could not put it down.  A great read.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|these guys are awesome!  power rock at it's finest. I have been to see Clutch in concert and plan to hit the tour for this release!
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|Totally sucks, and customer service help is incredibly hard to find.  Amazon is going to have to improve, or I'll just use one of the 6 other options on my Sony DVD1
B007W1D9NU|5.0|I found this book to be absolutely hilarious. Some of the entries are possibly a little to ribald for some people but well worth the read. The occasional swear word makes an appearance (usually by accident!).<br /><br />This would be a great book for those days you need a little pick-me-up.  I had tears running down my face for most of it.<br /><br /> Oh the joys of modern convience!!!
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|While it was a bit of a problem getting the correct driver downloaded (can't pull it off the mini CD on a modern Mac) the device itself works flawlessly!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|BEST. BOOK. EVER.!!!!<br />I need 17 more words if I want to submit this so I will say that I'm only 13 & bacon is delicious.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Everyone knows what this book is about, so I won't try and do the world one better in an attempt to describe it.<br /><br />As a bipolar man myself, this book hit very close to home. I'll never watch the movie because there's no way any director and group of actors could do it justice.<br /><br />This book has made me see the world in a different way, and a much better way at that.<br /><br />My kudos to the author for just flat out nailing the story. As an author myself, I know how difficult it is to write about such a topic, whether you're afflicted with manic depression or are the family member or friend of one who is.<br /><br />This isn't a love story, at least not on the whole. It's the inspirational account of a man who worked his ass off to make himself a better man. And to me, there's no better story than that.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|In this game you encounter epic boss fights new suits of shiny armour and plenty more. it does take a lot of space in your storage but it is well worth your time playing and installing it .
B000VWYNOG|5.0|What a perfect name for this album.  All the best of Van Morrison in one place.  Highly reccommend to all his fans.
0823004325|5.0|The amount of information in this book is incredible.  I am grateful to the author in sharing his wisdom in a straightforward way with plenty of examples.  No artist should be without it.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|to all believers out there let me tell you, this is a great book to buy. It doesn't only tell the story of the artist guy we know but about his life and all that he had to overcome. even if you dont like hi, after reading this im pretty sure you goinf to think other wise. i mean is one of those books i jyst couldnt put it down once i started reading and thrue it i learn a loth of things . so if you thinking obout buying it you should you would never reget it. so thre is only one thing to say: LET'S ALL BECOME BELIEVSRS!!!:-D
B002RI9PKO|5.0|It is an extraordinary book. It teaches you to be on the look out for opportunities. The many bits of biographical data in it are quite amazing and inspiring. It is a must read!
1596912863|2.0|Only a few of the many books which hang on the coat-tails of Jane Austen's genius manage to justify their publication. Austenland is not one of them.<br /><br />After a lifetime of bad emotional experiences, Jane receives a legacy from her beloved Aunt Carolyn. She is gifted a themed holiday in Austenland in the hope this will help her to recover from her lifetime Darcy obsession. When she reaches Pembroke Park, she meets a variety of actors clothed in Regency fashion and talking the talk of Regency England and takes part in tea-parties, chaste walks in the grounds and grand balls. So far, so boring.<br /><br />And thus it plods to its predictable conclusion. Very bad.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|An interesting story with lots of twists & turns, quite dark & disturbing at times, finished it, but wouldn't recommend it or read it again.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|First of all, I should say that I really believe in the FastDiet approach. I've lost fourteen pounds in nine weeks so far (keep in mind, I'm also taking Fucothin tablets, which can also be found on Amazon; these take a long time to kick in though, so I know that at least the first ten pounds of my loss were completely attributable to the FastDiet). The reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it's really overpriced for what is in the book. There isn't a whole lot to say other than &#34;Eat 500 calories twice a week.&#34; Past that there are studies that might have some kind of relationship to the plan, tips on how to handle the 500 calorie days, meal plans, and testimonials. I would have been much happier with just the core info for a lower price. But the bottom line is, I'm losing weight because of this book.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|AWESOME SEASON, ELANA, STEPHAN AND DAMON ROCK. ILL WATCH THIS TILL IT ENDS! CANT WAIT FOR SEASON 4 TO COME OUT!
1892005034|5.0|wife and I found this book to be exceptional. We read it together and have used it as an ongoing reference. It is hard work and takes some cans in outlook, but is well worth the effort
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Unfortunately, the Ultraviolet copy (the special show we were to get), was a bust.  I never did get to see it.  It did not stream through like it was supposed to, so (basically) it was a waste of advertising dollars.  Thank GOD that the movie itself, made up for the disappointment of not getting to see the &#34;special&#34;.
0375851569|5.0|My daughter loves Dr Seuss, when I am not reading any of his books she repeats his words to me.  Every child should have him as their first books.

0061950726|4.0|Seventeen year old Molly Ayers needs to log 50 hours of community service to keep her out of juvenile. Vivian Daly is a ninety year old woman who needs someone to help her clean and sort out her attic--an attic filled with childhood memories. On the surface seem to have nothing in common, but as they begin going through the boxes Molly learns a part of history rarely spoken about...Orphan Trains.<br /><br />Nine year old Vivian finds herself on an Orphan Train in 1929, leaving New York to parts unknown. The train fills up with other young orphans and heads to the Midwest searching for homes for the children. Some will find love, families and others find themselves as nothing more than servants.<br /><br />Molly relates because she too is an orphan, a foster child. Always searching for a home and never seeming to find one. The more Vivian shares with Molly, a loner goth, begins letting her guard down. Molly begins opening herself up and realizes she may be able to help Vivian with an unsolved mystery.<br /><br />I'd never heard about Orphan trains before reading this novel. It always makes me sad when I realize how much history we don't learn about in school. The novel goes back and forth between Vivian's past and current Molly (with her having a few flash backs of her own). The majority of the book is more about Vivian's past, which I was completely engrossed in. Ms. Kline I felt really wrote young Vivian so well. I could picture her and I wanted to reach out a help this young girl and allow her a childhood. As Vivian got older you could see even though she found happiness, she had been so hurt as a child it made her make a choice that broke my heart (sorry not going to spoil it!).<br /><br />I warmed up to Molly, but didn't really connect with her as much. There is tension with her foster mom Dina. The tension between Dina and Molly didn't work for me. Dina is written as a strong opinionated woman and to say she was fostering because of her husband just didn't make me a believer or the reasons she supposedly didn't like Molly. This for me was the only aspect that didn't work for me. I did enjoy the changes we see in Molly because of her relationship with Vivian, how she begins to come out of herself to help someone else and is loved in return.<br /><br />After reading just a few pages of Orphan Train, I had a hard time putting the book down. I ended the book with tears and wanting more. I wasn't ready to leave Molly and Vivian. I am highly recommending Orphan Train. This is one book you really don't want to miss out on experiencing.me a believer or the reasons she supposedly didn't like Molly. This for me was the only aspect that didn't work for me.

B00CL68NOG|1.0|I was terribly disappointed in this movie. After being subjected to the actor portraying the “son” berate and disrespect the actor portraying his “mother” for an hour, they finally begin to find some common ground – but it was too late to save this movie. I’m stupefied as to why Barbra Streisand would play this role. She’s far too good for something this badly written. The last thing any mom wants to hear on “her day” is a contentious adult son being so nasty to his mother. The only good thing about this movie was that I rented it – if I had gone to the theatre to see it or purchased the film, I’d be livid. And had it been a Mother's Day gift, as some reviewers had suggested -- I'd be heartbroken that my child thought so little of me.
B008MEM24S|4.0|game was for my son and he absolutley love it it was very upsetting at first because it wouldnt download but then it worked fine
B009439HEY|5.0|This is a fine album.  It isn't a re-interpretation of the old Genesis songs, but a bit of a &#34;freshening&#34; of them.  Fans of both the old (Peter Gabriel) and newer (Invisible Touch) Genesis should enjoy this.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I had seen o only one episode of twin peaks, but this brought out the best of that episode. I couldn't put it down once I started.
1907563202|5.0|Rarely do I find a book with more than one or two items that I want to make - the average pattern book is stuffed with the same old scarves and hats and blankets.  I actually bought this book because I saw the patchwork flower tote in the preview and thought it was adorable. I was so pleasantly surprised when I got this book and found it filled with projects that really are cute and easy - some are sort of silly, like the egg cozies - but most are actually items I want to and plan on making! The only drawback is that the author uses basically only pricy and hard to find wool yarns.  However I've been using simple (and cheaper) acrylic and cotton yarns I can easily find at my local craft store and the projects have come out fine. The projects all have sizes in inches so you can tell pretty quickly if the yarn you're substituting will give you the right size or not. I've already made three different projects and I've only had the book for four days.  Lovely, lovely stuff, like candy for crochet lovers!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Easy to do. Has both long and short term goals to make the game keep you interest. Occasionally freezes at startup for me.
B00466HM28|4.0|i love the keyboard. im just alittle confused with the making the drum kit work after installment of the disc. it was working before but now since I've downloaded the disc its not . any tips would be helpful
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It provoked a thoughtful conversation with my nephew who at the end of the film, looked puzzled and said &#34;I don't get it.&#34;
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|There aren't enough words to describe how awesome this set is! Take time to read the booklet inside, it's really meaningful to anyone who loves this music.
B000KIPD5E|1.0|On the one i was sent i can play only one guitar threw one amp at a time. I cant play two guitars threw one amp or one guitar threw two amps.The wording in the description is tricky and mislead me it is not worth what i paid for it.It adds some noise to the signal also.I am not happy with this pedal at all.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|My 6 year old knows the Harry Potter stories from his lego video games and just recently became old enough enough to start having the book read to him (and hold his attention), so we thought we'd try the first movie as well. He LOVED it! (And it was great seeing it again.) It's as faithful as a movie can be to a novel-sized fantasy book and doesn't disappoint (something I was concerned about for a smart kid who is big on details and knows both the book and the overall story). The extras also proved popular with my son, who wanted more once the movie was over (we all would have liked more, of course, but it was a good post-movie bit of family fun as it was). Highly recommended. The only issue is that we know the movies get darker/scarier with each installment so he likely won't be ready to watch year 3 on for a couple of years yet.Guess we'll just have to have this one on repeat until then. ;)
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The author seemed to kill off characters more for effect than for the story.  I felt much of the story line never really went anywhere.
B00785P2QC|5.0|awesome game to play when you have nothing else to do.but you must watch your spending so get gift cards.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|i love this game but they need to fffiiixxx it_they know what im talking about so yeah still waiting !!!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is my favorite game. I really enjoy it a lot. Gamloft needs to .take more like it. Keep up the good work.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|it is such a good story, but i did not like it as a musical.  they should have written it as a regular movie.

B005ZO6NRA|1.0|This film had none of the mystic feel that the original movies had. It was a sorry attempt at creating a world which was both believable and magically and the acting was aweful.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if it were just a little cheaper. Great graphics, storyline and gameplay and no glitches at all.

0143112724|5.0|This copy of Elements of Style was for my grandchildren.  The book is an annual refresher read for me and a go-to in times of doubt!  Should be on every wordsmith's bookshelf.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|i chose this rating because it is my favorite movie, and i've been waiting a long while for it to come out in video.Plus it came relivetivly fast in the mail.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Nice movie to watch with the wife/GF. Denzel plays well. Did not get bored at any moment and thought the ending was original.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|First of all, let me say that I spent maybe 5 hours total, researching the differences between this product and the Nostromo from Razer.  After reading dozens of threads each on a half dozen different sites, I came to the conclusion that I'd be perfectly satisfied with either one I chose.  So I went to Best Buy and actually put my hand on a Nostromo.  Hmm.  Feels too small.  That was the deciding factor to go with the G13.<br /><br />So you'd think using this thing would be as simple as plugging in, downloading drivers and you're good to go.  Otherwise I would have read something about that, right?<br /><br />Not so much.<br /><br />The first problem I had was with the profile it created for World of Warcraft the first time I installed the G13 gaming software.  I loaded this up and had it ready (or so I thought) before even loading WoW.  I went with the standard profile it suggested just to see how it worked.  I knew I'd change nearly everything, but I just wanted to test it out of the box.<br /><br />Ugh.  For some reason, the only thing that worked was using the joystick to walk forward.  Pressing the joystick into the device (much like pushing a middle mouse button down but 50x harder) was supposed to make me jump (which is the space bar's job on my keyboard).  Nope.  It instead decided to activate the ability I had mapped to my keyboard's \\"8\\" button...  Not sure how that works, but whatever.<br /><br />I spent the next 15 minutes going back and forth between the G13 interface and WoW, confirming that spacebar did not somehow magically mean \\"8\\", rebooting the computer and reloading the game several times, all to no avail.<br /><br />So I call the Logitech support hotline.  The next 10 minutes were spent explaining to the tech what this device was and what it looked like (how many g13 gaming keypads does Logitech make that are so different from each other that I need to spend 10 minutes explaining to a Logitech rep what it really is?  My guess is one).  I'm not sure how I managed to keep my composure there, but I'm proud of myself for it...<br /><br />To save you the same annoyance I'll just skip to the part where we completely scrapped the profile that the software initially has defaulted for WoW and created my own from scratch.  Nice, I was glad to finally be able to play the game with this thing.<br /><br />Time to throw the box and every identifiable piece of evidence I have for this thing in my apartment's dumpster...<br /><br />I shut my computer off for the night, and when I booted back up the next morning, my keyboard, mouse and G13 all froze.  It was clearly a driver issue.  I downloaded the new software (well, not really new but I downloaded it again anyway).  It seemed to work.  Nice, now I can put all that behind me.<br /><br />Nope.  Now it does this every time I boot up my pc.<br /><br />I posted something on the Logitech support forum.  No response for a day or two.  I bumped my post and finally got a tech to suggest deleting a bunch of USB instances from my device manager that weren't being currently used, performing a clean boot and reinstalling the gaming software.<br /><br />It was nice learning what a clean boot is for, but that's the only thing I got out of it.<br /><br />So I reposted on the thread I created on the Logitech site, found a similar (not surprisingly, unresolved) issue and posted a link to that one as well.<br /><br />It's been three days now, and I haven't heard anything.  I threw away my box, so I'm stuck with this thing, and it's a terrible feeling after putting so much effort into making the decision I did.  The money doesn't bother me so much as the time I spent reading so many different (positive) threads about either the G13 or the Nostromo, all to wind up with a product I've never been more dissatisfied with, that I can't return now, and have to deal with a very unresponsive and so far completely inept customer service team.<br /><br />Forget about this not being worth the money --it's not worth the time, which is way harder to come by.<br /><br />Edit (5/14/2013):  I decided to add to this as things progress.  Because I hadn't heard anything from the tech on the forum support site, I decided to call the night of Friday the 10th.  After informing the tech of my ongoing issue and referring him to the forum thread I had started, he elevated my call to the \\"level 2\\" team.  This means it's an issue that can be solved more expediently by the more experienced employees in the call center.  Specifically, he routed me to the tech that was assisting me within my forum thread.  She was unavailable at the time, and I was told they would be in touch (they are open on the weekends).<br /><br />It's now Tuesday the 14th, and have heard nothing from them, either on the forum thread or by phone.<br /><br />I think I'll inform them of this ongoing review to see if that lights a fire...
B009AMANBA|2.0|Must say I have been watching the movie for 1h40 now and I still do not see a plot. I suppose that he will get the 13th amendment through and so be it. No suspense or anything at any point. Disappointing.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I wanted to know what happened, I found the whole idea extraordinary, I liked the characters, it kept me guessing. Was a bit slow in the middle, some was a little predictable and there's always similarities between these sorts of books. Having said that I REALLY enjoyed reading it, quickly read the prequel and now am anxiously awaiting the third book.
B001EN71CW|5.0|What is wrong with FOX to cancel this show after it's first season. It was a BIG FAT HIT for me and everyone I know. I never saw anything online either that would lead me to believe anyone didn't like it of even LOVE it.  FoX did it to Stargate Universe too. It makes no financial sense to me. THis was The Old West, in Space. You know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. You fall in love with this cast almost immediately and wish you were part of the crew. I recommend this to anyone who loves Cowboys types and Spaceboy types and w***** with hearts of gold.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the older version better but this version works well too.  I have not had any problems at all with it. I liked being able to see sun rise and sun set on the last version.  You can see it here too, but it takes a few more clicks.  Make the sun rise/set times eaiser to see and I'll give it ★★★★★.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I LOVED the Serenity (Firefly) story. This Movie played out ver much like the series, but veered off on it's story line. It was a good Movie, but really just a character of the TV show. It looks like the writer tried to cram a 5 year long series in to this 2 hour Movie. He missed the mark. I liked it, but not as I liked the series. What is wrong with FOX to cancel this show after it's first season. It was a BIG FAT HIT ! They did it to Stargate Universe too. It makes no financial sense to me.
1579129129|5.0|This book is a nice conversation starter and full of a lot of great pics from the collection. I leave it out all the time just so I can read a bit more each time I pick it up.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I saw a Movie in the 1970s based on this Book. This is a remarkable story and says a lot about how the Government never forgets or forgives.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter, but found that I was playing it more than she was. It's a cute game, but not very challenging.  It reminds me of being a young child playing with the toys.
1401941893|5.0|A thoughtful, beautiful book perfect for young women concerned about personal growth and spirituality.  Lots of positive affirmations and messages.  A positive, lovely book.  Highly recommended.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This Alarm clock has many alarm settings to chose from.  Including different clock faces, snooze settings  I chose the Rooster for my alarm tone and it did wake me up. Great Alarm Clock!
B0079IEPHA|5.0|The main characters have a dynamic chemistry that just clicks!  Their punch lines are witty, the plot is entertaining and of course the characters played it well.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|The History of the Eagles is just that, two disks of history and background of the members.  The bonus concert footage could be  longer. I don't care for the way the two history disks are stacked on one another.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|I have already finished Suits Season 1 first and then I've switched to wathcing White Collar - I would say this show pales in comparison with Suits.... the lines are a bit dry and the characters do not seem spontaneous.  It takes a couple more episodes to get me interested in this show and eventually I've grown to like it.  The plot improves along the way and the characters I guess have become more accustomed to their role and seem to play it better over time.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved the story, definitely a buy! My mother in law was from Derry, so it reminded me of her. I most likely will buy this story, even though I have already read it.
B0058SNKRY|5.0|I've come to really like croc shoes & sandals.  I had previously ordered a pair of their tennis shoes in the size I normally wear a tennis shoe in.  My toes came to the end so when I ordered these sandals I ordered a little big.  Since the back strap isn't adjustable they were too big. Amazon has excellent exchange policies so I was able to exchange it for a size smaller and they fit great and super comfortable.  I'll just remember that if I plan to wear socks to order a size larger.
B00A6SZS2Q|4.0|I am a major BVB fan and they seriously delivered with this album! I will never know what to expect next from them! My only issue is fairly small. When I got it, there was a decently sized crack in the case. But the CD was unharmed, so no real harm done! :)
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This could easily be a great game if it didn't freeze as often as it does.  Once the game does freeze it shuts down and you have to reenter the application.
0140120416|4.0|Needed a new book on Russian it is good and up to date for the needs of a person learning Russian.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It was definitely not a true page turner and written on a 8th grade level. Not on par with Earlier books
B00005O3VC|5.0|I have seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail so many times I cannot even begin to remember the number, and it is just as funny each time. Britain produced a lot of great comedy, but none better than this group and none better than this movie.
B007PKDW44|5.0|I have no desire to listen to any other band right now. Every song is excellent.  I am so pleased they include the lyrics. Great record.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|After a better-than-average debut with a better-than-average cast for comics into film, this franchise has declined into mere eye-candy, and not very sweet at that.  The plot of Iron Man 3 is largely nonsensical, and barely serves to provide a prop for the next action or FX sequence.  As for the cast, gotta be the easiest money they've ever made (other than maybe Downey's $50M for Avengers), as little acting is required.  Per usual, performers like Cheadle, Kingsley, Paltrow and Pearce are utterly wasted, as -- for the most part -- is Downey himself.<br /><br />If you're an avid fanboy, or action and visuals alone will amuse you for two hours, this may be the film for you.  Otherwise, symbolic of the worst in commercial cash cows as well as Disney and Hollywood's faith that smoke and mirrors are enough to convince the average viewer that this is some kind of art; it's not even entertainment.  I'd rather watch Phantom Menace again...
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I was a little nervous about this record from Volbeat since I didn't think they could possibly come close to creating the same level of music and lyrics to compare with their last CD.  The more I listen to this, tho, the more I like it.  They set the bar pretty high with Beyond Hell/Above Heaven, but this is a very solid follow-up.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I really like this game.  Just wish it had more levels.  My 8 year old son also plays it and likes it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I cannot believe this series was not allowed to fulfill its awesome potential.  Great story, special effects, settings, characters, and acting. I am grateful the movie Serenity provides some closure for this show.  Spoiler Alert! - watch this TV series before enjoying Serenity!
0307944689|1.0|After studying with TOEFL by McGrawHill nothing seems to be better. This is what is going on with Cracking the Toefl book, they want to explain things sooo much that you end up confuse.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I loved this movie even more re-watching it in 2013 than when it first came out. Loyalty, teamwork, and tolerance are the 'heavy' themes of this light, heart-warming movie.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Heavy and with a purpose, Hatebreed continues putting a message to move forward into their lyrics and music.  Push yourself to improve and don't dwell on the past.  One of the first Hatebreed albums I loved after the first listen.
055357342X|5.0|The book was great - lots of unexpected twists in the story.  Definitely leaves you excited to read the next book (which according to most reviews is not awesome, so that's a bummer).
B0031P6X2K|5.0|I think everyone knows how great this lp was and is.  i had it on lp and tape and cd. Sundazed is a great label and they put this out.  This new vinyl is thick and has Unbelieveble low noise, almost cd like. Its not 180 gram but it is great quality. The cover and back are all the same as the old lp, and it came with a nice plastic inner bag.  I recomend anyone to get a new lp of this recording.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It does what it should.  I don't own any mp3's so I don't need the paid version to use my own music to wake up to.  It's a great travel clock, as long as you leave it plugged in.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Absolutely love this game, makes me come back every ten minutes to get my coins lol so awesome! Recommend to everyone!
1608955702|5.0|This small book (160 pages) deals with lighting for the portrait in all its aspects.<br />No posing techniques here, the book title is pretty accurate - It is all about light: available light vs. flash light, light modifiers, light measurement, indoor vs. outdoor light, on camera vs. off camera flash.<br /><br />No grand unifying theory of what makes a good picture here (phew!) but great pictures with how and why they were lit the way they were. There are regularly pull-back shots showing the setup. The first two chapters even have a few photos labeled \\"BAD!\\" and why, something I would like to see more as one learns more from mistakes than from success and it is less painful to learn from other people's mistakes, even when they are voluntary to make a point.<br /><br />What's great with this book is that it deals with the technical aspects without making them painful. The downside of course is that the reader is supposed to be at least somewhat knowledgeable in photography - this is not a book for the complete beginner.<br /><br />In a way I find it is quite complementary with the [[ASIN:1584281251 Master Lighting Guide for Portrait Photographers]] that details all the variants of all the poses and lighting diagrams. The master lighting guide is essentially studio while the direction and quality of light deals with on-location including some wedding or engagement pictures but all in all they go well together.<br /><br />What does not hurt, it is easy and friendly to read and it makes a decent coffee table book.<br />To me a solid four-stars-and-a-half; two of his earlier books are in my Amazon shopping cart.<br /><br />I hope this helps. Don't hesitate to ask me questions in comments.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent story, casting, authentic scenery.  Looking forward to watch seasons three and four.  Hoping it gets picked up for years to come.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a delightful series.  It is a quick and engaging read.  I will definitely read it again and again. Great for any age (teen and above).
B009GXHOW4|5.0|First when you spawn in the items go to chest and and you will see the items then put them in and out of the chest
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I bought this series to re-read it.  I loved it even more the second time around and will probably read it again and again in the years to come.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love this album! Kelly Clarkson is one of the best artist ever. I still have the CD on repeat. The new singles on here awesome!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my second time reading this series.  I loved this book even more the second time and will be reading again and again.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I watched one episode of the walking dead and was instantly hooked. The walking dead is one of the best zombies shows around. Love it. We actually turned into family night!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very accurate and you can easily change locations.  I use this all the time to plan trips to the coast or to plan events.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I like picsart but takes a long time to load and I'm not being put in instresting or baby catogorys. you should download but be sure to update.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|This movie is amazing because it really shows you the good and bad side of a desperate sitiuation. This movie will warm your heart.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book! Really made me think about the value of time and how we as a society get so caught up in it.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie is very boring. It could have been done in a 15 minutes episode. I want my money back.
B001TM14VC|5.0|I really love this movie but for some reason I can never get ANY movie from Amazon to work through my player.  Even tho it has Amazon movies as an option they never stream through.  I had to watch this movie through Netflix which always works.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|Loved the movie....if you're into guitar or just into great musicians its a must have....the live concert footage alone is worth the price
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My husband and I literally love this series!  It is exceptionally well done.  We love the contrast between the classes and the reactions to the changing times, especially during and because of the war.  The styles of the times are also fascinating.  This is a first class production.  We have already watched each episode twice, and are still enjoying it. We eat our dinner, and then have a &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; night at least once a week. We will be looking forward to Season Four, and will be purchasing it as soon as it is available.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great Read!  I could not put it down!  This book is MUST read.<br />I would recommend this book to all Freedom-Loving Americans!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how they are always looking for a new scene and how it's always New stuff like board's and characters.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|My wife and I have been working on this fun addictive little game for a couple of weeks now but some of the combos we need to finish it Don't work...still, very fun.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|VAN HALEN-VAN HALEN: This is truly ground zero for many hard rock guitar heads, a blistering, monolithic opening shot that hipped the masses to EDDIE VAN HALEN's mind-bending furnace-blast of slam bang six string pyrotechnics. VAN HALEN's self-titled debut kicked off with a hellzapoppin' hat-trick...the ominous RUNNIN' WITH THE DEVIL, volcanic guitar showcase ERUPTION and a metal-ized cover of the KINKS' YOU REALLY GOT ME (which RAY DAVIES and company answered with their own mind numbin' version on their next concert disc). JAMIE'S CRYIN' and AIN'T TALKIN' 'BOUT LOVE, both bolstered by bass player MIKE ANTHONY's piercing high harmony vocals, proved further ferocious radio fodder, while a melt-down of the JOHN BRIM bloozer ICE CREAM MAN oozed sexual innuendo tailor-made for lead growler DAVID LEE ROTH's swaggering bravado and snarky asides. This brontosauric breakthrough stomped over all contenders in '78 (granted, a lot of the &quot;competition&quot; was disco and punk), an ultimately unforgettable, highly influential party-poundin' platter never topped by VAN HALEN...or damned few other bands for that matter.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE HAMMER-ON'S
B005H9B44A|5.0|Awesome movie and a real fantasy to see ... The animation and effects were stunning and the cinematography was out of this world ...
B005H9B44A|3.0|Not bad for the CGI effects but a bit of a let down when you consider the big name actors involved.  Pick between this movie and watching golf on a rainy afternoon.
030758836X|5.0|I was going to write a review put I'll just refer you to one I read because what he said make perfect sense.<br /><br />Reviews that criticize the ending simply miss the point, June 22, 2012<br />By Paul Reece<br />This review is from: Gone Girl: A Novel (Hardcover)
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The picture quality is not good.  The camera on my smart phone is much better so I won't use this at all.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg, as always, is an articulate storyteller and advocate for working woman. Some of the book echoed strongly of her past talks and speeches, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|Play is ok but much prefer the Windows version.  I will play if sitting at an airport waiting for my flight.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is no doubt the top competitor for minecraft, and I find the settings, and creating and accessing world's much more user friendly. The recipedia is a great touch, I bought the full version and am now switched to this in place of minecraft.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Took awhile to get me interested like some of his previous stories, but by the end I was fully hooked
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book better than the movie if you haven't read it then do because it's the best! OMG! Read it
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest and think it has great ideas.  I have a little trouble navigating the site but with more use, I'll probably not have that problem.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fast. and easy<br />love playing without shuffling the deck of cards.  need to have a scoring. system.  Could also play with other players.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|The pace felt a little sluggish; but the prose that seemed at times to offer too much detail, in doing so, artfully supported one of the themes of the novel about memory and the nature of memory verses living in the present. It held my interest through the end.  The writing was very good and the narrative well constructed.<br />If you're looking for a good novel that's thought provoking with memorable characters / context and fairly compelling, you'll likely be pleased. Solid, yes; but for me did not quite jump the bar of truly exceptional to yield 5 stars. By comparison books that did for me: City of Thieves, Comedy in a Minor Key, The Dog Stars, Atonement... In case you were curious.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|After careful character development, the book itself gets a little trite in the end but it was a good read.
1594484805|3.0|I haven't had a chance to read the entire book.  So far it's pretty good, I may have to submit another review when I'm done.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This may not be your cup of tea (some people still can't get enough of \\"Terms of Endearment\\"), but if you like the genre, this will knock your socks off!
0307352153|4.0|Very interesting and I'm enjoying reading it for a second time.  I would recommend this book to anyone who may think they are an introvert.
B007IL59D2|5.0|I've become hooked on Phillipa Gregory's Cousins series and have read all the books.  They're wonderful and give a great insight into the Plantagenet/Lancaster feud.  I love the way the cousins series looks at the War of The Roses in terms of the most influential women of the period. This book is about Ann Neville and is a fascinating read.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book is renowned for its beautiful literature and the amount of depth and truth an author can place in his writing is ironic.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This is the first in a long line of Oz books.  It is not the movie.  If you, or you young reader this is for, have never seen the movie, but intend to.. watch the movie first, then read.  I have seen the movie, as well as return to Oz, and the newest Oz movie with the wizard coming to Oz.  I am glad I saw the movie first.  As with all books that are made into movies, there are differences.  The book, most the time are better, that the changes made to make them into film make the movie less enjoyable.  That is how I see this.  The book is great, and different than what I expected after years of watching the movie.  Go into this book forgetting what you think should be, and follow Dorothy through her trip into and through Oz.  This is a great book to share with your children, nieces, nephews, grand kids, ect..  also.
B00B4804KS|5.0|What can I say about a movie that has proven 20 years has not aged it.  Now, it's in 3D!  If you're wondering if it's worth the 3D, it depends.  If you like things to pop out in front of you (like I do), you may be disappointed.  But, the way the 3D was implemented was still very good.  The depth looks great and the picture looked very clean.  I had to keep reminding myself this movie is 20 years old because it just looks that good.  I just think the 3D made the movie more immersive.
B009GFEOY8|4.0|This film took reasonably good pictures.  It is not as convient as the original Kodak, Zero film in that it takes much longer to develop.  Therefore, you need to protect it with one hand while you use your other two hands to take another picture.  After awhile, you can check the first one to see if you got what you wanted.  The original film took only one minute.  Still, it was a remarkable achievement to reinvent this film so that the SX-70 Land Cameras could still be used.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|This series is a must watch it has well placed fan service and there is a lot of it! The story about the zombies is not over done and is exciting! The characters are all well developed and I felt like I knew them all personally. I am an anime collector and am proud to have this series in my collection. It really leaves you wanting more but how much more can you do with zombies?!? Every minute of this series is heart pounding action! Buy it. Now !!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It looks like alien fuel. Pretty cool. I use it because it is so easy to visually check if it is charged enough. I would give 5 stars if it would beep or text me! No surprises are wanted when it comes to battery charges! Lol
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I will say that this is not my favorite of the outlander series but still an amazing book. Packed with adventure and sweetness I find myself on the edge of my seat through most of the book waiting to find out what is going to happen next. I am absolutely in love with Jamie and Claire, their story is fantastic. I cannot wait to start the next book in the series. This series will become a yearly ritual for me. Well worth the credit. Absolutely wonderful. Another winner for Diana Gabaldon.
1609611543|3.0|Our PCP really has seen an improvement in his healthe & many of his patients who have tried a &#34;wheat free diet&#34;<br />We have started to alter our diets, but will take a while to see if the changes make a difference. The book certainly<br />is interesting & lots of &#34;food for thought!&#34;
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I am a huge Bruno Mars fan and my boyfriend got me this for Christmas.  I listened to the entire CD while relaxing in a nice warm bubble bath and I was definitely not dissapointed.  I loved this CD!! Usually when I buy a CD I end up like 5 or 6 songs and hating the rest but with this CD I loved almost every song!  Definitely a CD to buy! &#60;3
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun, addictive and you can't beat free.  Though a few times ads popped up and were kind of a distraction.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Having all the Blu-Rays in one collection is awesome.I am a big fan of Harrison Ford.However, I think the box set should have come in a better case, maybe like Ark, or Stones.Just a tip.Ciao.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun and addictive.  I tried it out first and had a lot of fun.  Daughter took over and loved it as well.  She thinks the Om Nom is cute.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|there were a lot of the episodes i did not get to see because of my work hours.  these are a real treat for me
B007MDB71O|5.0|Disregard the critical flaming this movie got when it was released in the theaters.  It's a lot better than what people have been saying.  Plus the blu-ray looks great.  Packaging is kind of generic (what do you expect when they didn't promote this movie correctly to begin with?)
B005HEK3JW|5.0|ditto for this one, did not get to see it, but now it is a real treat.  I really enjoy watching it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Daughter loves making houses and stuff with this game.  I've played it too and it's very addictive. And you can't beat the price.
0451169514|5.0|This is a very good book!  I'm almost done with the third chapter, and I already got really into it so far! I can't believe how long this book is!! It's like over a thousand pages!! It's probably going to take me a few years to read through it all!! It must've taken Stephen King quite a long time to write IT! Stephen King is also a VERY great author!! Now I know why people call him the &#34;master of horror!!&#34; I've also seen the movie a lot of times in my life, and I've always wanted to read the book! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes horror stories!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Glorious 2nd season to the hit TV series.  Plus the blu-ray is gorgeous looking.  Packaging is nice and looks great with the 1st season set.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have this installed on my Kindle and Galaxy. By using it I was able to identify why I had poor quality wifi signal. By changing my wifi channel I was able to keep a quality connection. This will also help while vacationing as well. Note that on a netbook you will need to install the previous version 2. It will not work on a PC.
0345803485|5.0|Enjoyed the read, some people will be offended by it ~ I did like the story line and couldn't put it down.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Another one of the best trilogies Sylvia Day is also an awesome author.  The story line is a very erotically descriptive book and engaging I CAN'T WAIT for the the final installment of the crossfire series the series draws you in so you become part of the story.
0345803507|5.0|Loved the book, it might offend some people. Read all of them and I think this was the best. Later sold all the books as a set and made some good $$.
B009X011UQ|3.0|Looking at it on line it looked like it would not stay up good, and it doesn't.  Great color, sound comes thru good.
0345803493|5.0|Ended up reading all these books...loved them, some people  might be offended by some of it! But a good story line!
0385349947|5.0|This book was amazing, and potentially life-changing.  While I was reading it, I was nodding along and talking out loud to the book, agreeing with what it was telling me!  It opened my eyes to the mistakes I have made in my career, but provided solutions as to how I could go about fixing the issues over which I have control.  I recommend this book for all humans, regardless of gender.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|So far I am mostly very pleased with the browser, except for having a hard time viewing a few videos on Youtube.  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.  Again, I have not been using this very long since I just received it as a gift so more comments may be coming.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Balls to the Wall is one of the all time metal classic albums. It has hooks, heavy, and UDO. It's a perfect example of why the 80's were so great for metal....
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I don't know how they do it but every season and every show is based on a different storyline with the season's premise continuing to evolve.  I really look forward to this show and loved the marathon weekend I took to catch up on all the details from previous seasons.
B0000017CA|5.0|Probably one of the greatest underground metal albums ever. Acid Bath's debut came at a time when Grunge was pretty much the dominant musical force in America. Acid Bath was one of the bands that kick started the metal movement in the 90's and brought metal back into play. I got to see one of their last shows in January of '97. Seems like yesterday. R.I.P. Audie.....
B007704HO6|5.0|A really nice story. Nicely written. Does not waffle like some similar types of books. I looked forward to picking it up each night.
B00BH413IG|5.0|This is the second album of Craig Taborn to ECM, the first one was a solo piano album and this one is a beautiful trio album. Taborn is one of the best pianist of his generation, but this is more compact, more intensive , the best one. Probably Manfred Eicher is the best music producer in the last 25 years. He have the sound in his head and then look for the appropriate musician to do it. The musicians are absolute free but the concept came from Manfred. Is not estrange that in the last 6 months he produce the best new american jazz today; \\"Sirens\\" of Chris Potter and this excellent \\"Chants\\" .<br /> Is pure ECM sound. Taborn on piano, Thomas Morgan on bass and Gerald Cleaver on drums had made a incredible CD. Complicate but full of ideas and feelings. Each notes are important, even the silence are important. The Craig composition are great but the musical improvisation are magic. Is a great experience hear this kind of music, is different and fresh. Like the Potter album you need time to hear it and attention but the prize is wonderful; a great  music, a new concept of trio improvisation music. You can hear classical influence, contemporary sounds, and all this, under the master conception of Manfred Eicher.  You must buy
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I was amazed with all the information about each President from Truman to Obama.<br />I did live through much of this history.
0399226907|5.0|Classic book. Love reading it and looking at it with my 8-month-old daughter. I know she'll read and enjoy this book for years to come.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|A very thought provoking book.  This is the conversation we should be having about teacher qualities and how each and every one of us can make a difference.  For me, this validated what my 14 year old son experienced as a volunteer tutor working with at risk elementary students. He intuitively utilized some of the methods discussed in this book and made real progress in getting these students through their homework and eventually a desire to learn and do well in school.
067144901X|5.0|Love it! We have Sandra Boynton's Snuggle Puppy and my daughter enjoys it. I wanted to get her another by the same author. She loves looking at the pages and trying to make the sounds. It's colorful, fun, and stimulating. This one is definitely a permanent part of our library.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|This is the same issue others experience.  The adapter works for a few months, then the thunderbolt end becomes very sensitive to the point of having to restart the computer to get the display to show up.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Think this game took off from last games mechanics and blew it out the water very fun and can be fast paced
B00881PTRC|5.0|The game of Hangman is a fun classic in its own right, and this version does it very well with a wide variety of word categories, and a large vocabulary of words.  It takes it a step further, by adding lots of nice modern touches, such as animation of the hanging man, and access to [internet] dictionary definitions of words you fail to succeed at.  Overall, if you like hangman, I don't think it could be presented better.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good game, kind of like Temple Run. Lags and sometimes crashes on my first generation kindle fire. Would be really cool if you could build your own suits.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is one of the best mice I have bought for the price.  It has great features and high dpi for precise tracking.  Definitely helped in the first person games from my little MS wireless mouse I was using to play with.  Software is very customizable also.  I like the color change options for the LED.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is really great. everyone who likes these type of make you own community games you will love this
B009P5S11G|5.0|I am a huge fan of Rihanna...so obtaining this CD was to add to my collection. Rihanna did not disappoint on this CD. I would recommend this purchase to anyone
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I found this fascinating to hear the true stories of defection from North Korea. I previously read The Orphan Master's Son and Escape from Camp 14 and this book was a great follow up. It filled in a lot that I didn't know about the beginning of the dynasty. The writing was straight forward and easy to read. I could feel the torment of the defectors knowing they leave their families in great danger and that they may never see them again. There was one small part in the book that really got to me. When Kim il-sung died everyone HAD to be seen crying. In a classroom one little girl was seen spitting in her hands and putting them to her face so it would look like she was crying. If you weren't crying punishment was to be sent to a camp. Just like when the son and now Kim il-un are shown in public, everyone MUST clap and smile. People are watched constantly for any infractions. I could go on, but better to just read the book.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Bought this DVD for my daughter, cause she follows the show. She loves it and cannot wait for the second season to purchase
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|To my friends and the kid at st france cabrinni school.and my mom she is a big reader and she would love the book.
0345803493|4.0|Havent gotten to read it. Still on the first book and so far the first book is great. Cannot wait to read this and I would give another review when I am done
0385535147|5.0|Grisham has done itagain! This one starts a little slow, but once it gets up to speed I couldn't put it down. Very good and I will be waiting for his next one.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|I downloaded the Lite version and when the story was over (it wasn't complete) he HAD to know what happened and asked about it for a couple of days so I downloaded it.  He plays this story every chance he gets, I usually don't pay for apps for him because you never know what a kid will or won't play with. I'm very glad I downloaded this.
0446580848|2.0|The violence and main character's attitude were objectionable to me. Therefore, I didn't finish reading this book. I'll pass it along to someone who enjoys this type of thriller/spy intrigue book.
B00004RF8J|5.0|loved the show and wanted to update my dvd's,.... all great stars are in it,...like the out takes and the backround of the storey
0307237699|5.0|This is Obama's second book.  His first book &#34;dreams from my father&#34; and this book won Grammy awards for &#34;spoken word.&#34; Obama is quite open about why he chose to be a Democrat...he believed in helping people, of being of service to people.<br /><br />I really wish all those Obama haters would read this book. He is not turning the country into communism or a tyrannical monarchy.  He truly wants to help people but he very much believes in people doing stuff for themselves...being responsible parents and responsible citizens.<br /><br />Before becoming a US Senator he was a professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School.  A prestigious law school.  This book shows him to be a compassionate, extremely intelligent man with a whole lot of common sense.<br /><br />Recommned highly.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is my favorite game, but beware! You usually get a very low version, but that is only a possibility. I got lucky, and the version I got was the latest one. This is the best game for minecraft beginners and I recommend this to all people who aren't easily phased by the localized and blocky animations.( tip: try this seed 4.0.4 and dig straight down, or try the seed ' pear')
B009S33I68|5.0|A very realistic story of the war in Vietnam.  Interesting but made me sick to think of our boys in situations like  that.  Anyone who is interesting in this period of history would really like this book!!
0374533555|5.0|This is a great book! Daniel does an excellent job in presenting his research in a clear and concise manner.<br /><br />I learned a tremendous amount about my own thought patterns; when they go wrong and when they are helpful.<br /><br />I learned about Daniel after watching his TED talks online.
B004LZF2LW|3.0|okay app, was not what I was really looking for, but I do use it to check the time in china where my daughter is living
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very awesome you should also either try jetpack joyride or temple run which are very similar this game can be challenging but us fun there are very many characters to chose from and tins if things yo buy
1400069289|5.0|I went back and forth on buying this based on some of the reviews saying only a few sections were interesting. I just finished reading it and I've got to say it is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. I found the science and the stories riveting, and I immediately started analyzing the habits in my own life (and plotting how to modify those of my children). I even skipped reading my book club book to read this - and it was worth sitting at my meeting with nothing to contribute, (though I did give a plug for this book).<br /><br />Seriously though - the writing style is superb. It held my interest all the way through. I recommend it to anyone who really is interested in a good read and especially so those who find human behavior worth studying.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|thought it would be better but i am very disappointed. hoping it would be like a normal game like the batman arkahm city but its more like subway surfer. same game just different characters. i dont like games that need a credit card to play them. horrible to be called Iron Man.
B00A83075M|5.0|In a world full of princess movies Disney created the perfect movie for little boys (and girls too!) this movie has everything you love about Disney movies!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I'm a big fan of the books, but I was afraid of what would happen to them on HBO. Nothing to fear--HBO has followed the books brilliantly and in fact, has helped simplify some of the plotlines and characters so my tiny brain can absorb them. Peter Dinklage is phenomenal.
B00CHILW64|5.0|You are a robot if this movie doesn't at least get you teary-eyed!  It's powerful and awe-inspiring!  I highly recommend it.
B004I744AS|5.0|What a great app! I am a student in college and I use this dictionary constantly. I also like the games which help enhance your vocabulary.
B004WX1W0I|5.0|this one was second one because the first one's case was damaged. so i sent it back and reorder same one. it's came without any problem and the new price was little lower.
B000FBJG04|4.0|I was assigned to the 101st, 3rd/187th battalion when I arrived in Vietnam.  For the most part, the unit did not have paratroopers, but was &#34;airmobile&#34;' performing combat assaults via helicopter.  The unit had participated in &#34;Hamburger Hill&#34; and was on easier duty when I joined them.  I had the same awe for the guys I joined as did those joining Easy Co after D-Day.  Forty-four years later I am still proud to say I served in the 101st!<br /><br />A few years ago, I saw a news report of soldiers from the 3rd/187th ferreting out Al Caida in Afghanistan and surprised by the amount of pride I had for my unit two generations later.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone. It made me laugh, and cry, to the point I think my family thought I was going mad, but  I enjoyed every moment of it. It's extremely touching and lovely, I haven't a bad word to say about it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was okay but I really thought it had more potential and could have become something more than it was.
B00AQLGXTU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and its sequel and cannot wait for the next one. Its great to read a strong female charachter holding her own in a foreign world.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I was thrilled to get this in ebook form but it is distracting/ confusing as it go from one place to another. After getting well into the book, I said to myself many times, what does this have to do with anything. I finally got so frustrated had to put aside and read other books. Dont know if I'll go back. I've read other books with these kind of themes and enjoyed them.
0345803485|4.0|Went through this book quickly. I kept wondering about how someone gets so twisted.That why you have to read the second in the triligy Fifty Shades Darker. Some of the descriptions get quit regular like 'my inner self'.With a long hot summer coming up I'm ready for the 3rd book in the trilogy, before it becomes a movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Outstanding!  The ambiguity of who are the good guys and who are the bad guys was riveting.  I am still not sure!!!
0345803493|4.0|This has been a fun read that goes by quickly. I hear it's going to become a movie. I can't wait!
B002ZG98C8|5.0|I gave this movie to my son for his 27th birthday along with a real machete, he absolutely loved it !!!!
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|In this world of bland, stale hip-hop, it's nice to know there are people who are still willing to push boundaries and even offend people. Coming off of the success of his last album, &#34;Goblin&#34; Tyler, The Creator has crafted another album of finely honed and quite skillful hip-hop. The album has much of the same stripped down and raw production that his previous albums did, but this time, the album's not quite as dark lyrically. Oh sure, there's still a whole lot of anger there on some tracks, but some of the more taboo themes from previous albums are gone. While this may come as a disappointment to some, the album is still really quite good. His lyrics are still as fresh and inventive as they've ever been and the album is still a fun listen. If you're a fan of the Odd Future crew, or just looking for some new hip-hop music that doesn't suck, look no further.
0345525558|4.0|Great read! Fell in love with each characters. Would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys this author. Definitely one of my favorites.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Love this cd, it is now one of my favorite Deftones cds. Definitely recommend it if you are a fan
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Love this show<br /><br />It's addicting and so fun!<br /><br />It's great I come home and watch it and literally time flys
B003Y5H556|5.0|I like this movie, but didn't want to spend a lot.  When it came, it was in good condition and the movie was perfect.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|At the time, I thought this was the best show on television!  After streaming the series, I still do!  Bring it back!!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This is by FAR....The BEST , I said the BEST new artist, and Blues LP I've heard in a Loooooong time !!! period.
1439127700|4.0|My husband read this and loved it so much, I got it as a gift for someone.  The only thing that startled me was the paper edges of the book.  Normally, they are smooth and trim and this book has the finish of raw edges that are not even.  I guess it is supposed to look &#34;handmade.&#34;  At first I thought it was a defect, but when I checked BN, they had other books with this finish.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am writing this review with this keyboard and I must say that I can't believe I have been using the other keyboard for this long.<br />The logic behind the prediction is amazing and the interface is pleasing.  The only draw back is the learning curve with the whole swiping feature.  Once you're past that you're golden.
1400052181|5.0|i will read almost anything in this category since i used to be in the med biz and have had cancer.  i only wish that there were more hard-cover books around - or at least some way to make paper-backs lie flat.  lacks herself was an amazing woman and i'm glad to have made her aquaintance.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this more than expected.  It's a nice game to kill some time and if runs great on my Kindle Fire.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Rec for all women, regardless of ambitions or economic background.  Insightful and moderate.  Provides great ways to discuss issues at hand today.
B008J34466|5.0|CD is loaded with my favorites the sound is great<br />Well worth the money<br />Could not wait to get it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app...the ads are a minor thing...since a click will remove them. Best solitaire game app that I've played, and I've played them all.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Just love Joe live -- this is a great addition to your library, I recommend it highly, I've told all my friends :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Well, in my humble opinion, this book is not well written, it doesn't have a plot but it's really addictive...
B00797MB0O|4.0|First of all ,I  really like watching Charlize Theron. I feel there are a lot of people that need to watch this movie. She really had to start growing up the hard way. You can't always pick up the past where you left off. Her intentions were bad. and it hurt people.<br />But, does anyone ever really totally grow up ?
B002VHI8J0|5.0|This is a dazzling work. I was an english lit double major and read so much unsatisfying post-modern crap at university that I've been put off the genre that this book would be loosely associated with for about 2 decades. This book is unbelievably good. It is intelligent, engaging, well written and utterly compelling. I did find at some point I needed to understand the plot structure by reading about the book, and think I enjoyed it more for having done so. I think I'd've otherwise been distracted by curiosity from engaging with the book as closely. I can't imagine how it could possibly work as a film and don't know that I'll bother with that though.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Bought it as an early Mother's day gift and she absolutely loves the show! This is one of my favorite shows by far..ya can't go wrong with The Help! Love, love, love this quote from The Help, &#34;You is kind, you is smart, you is important.&#34; :)
B004PYDBVM|5.0|The author demonstrates through his own testimony how powerhungry and vicious the North Korean Kim regime happens to be. I was moved by how the author's family moved to North Korea from Japan with a starry-eyed vision of North Korean society, only to realize their mistake in moving there. Although the book covers the 1970s and 1980s, it is just as relevant now; since the North Korean government has not changed its policy of imprisoning political prisoners.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Really awesome game that really shares the experiences of a real iron man. Great graphics too. This is really worth buying
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so fun.so awesome. great for everyone including kids. fun and is a great fun app. :)) I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fantastic game. I would recommend this.magnificent game to any body. I had a blast playing it.if you enjoy rather exhilarating games
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am so happy that Robert Jordan's family found Mr Sanderson.  He kept the story true without having to add his own flare to it.<br /><br />If you have not read the whole series yet, do so or you are missing out on a great story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a shorter game, it only took me about 2 hours to complete but it was worth it! I love puzzle games that truly make me think! This game was pristine in its creation. The developers clearly took their time and paid close attention to detail. You won't be disappointed!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Have seen this many times on TV & enjoyed my two favorite sexy men & the movie too. Had to have it for my collection.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Babs and Rogan trot out every Jewish mother stereotype around (Thankfully, my Jewish mother never had be a caricature of herself). The \\"tender\\" moments were uncomfortable and the chemistry between the two was non-existent. I stuck it out to the end and am sorry I did. You learn all you need to know about the movie in the first 15 minutes; there are no surprises in store. Skip this one.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My only complaint is how long it takes to build up credits. Other than that, it's great! Here's Iron Man!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is a nice addition for obtaining weather information for a given area of interest. Good up to date data.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I Love this show!! Mystery, Intrigue, and suspense all in one.  I can't wait for season 2!!  When is season 2 set to release????
B009KEN87O|4.0|Like passing the time while waiting to meet an appointment? This app will just do the trick.  Lots of challenging stages to over come.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|This was an amazing movie, that should be a cult film.  The music was excellent and woven into the plot perfectly.  The dance scenes were incredibly creative.  For a teen of the 60s, it captured the tremendous amount of change and upheaval in that decade.  For anyone else it was a great historical review, with references to everything from Kent state to Viet Nam to the Beatles rooftop concert to the explosion of the Weathermen's headquarters, as well as the drug culture and sexual revolution.  I loved the little hidden lines from Beatles songs thrown into the dialogue.  I can't say enough positive about this movie.  I loved it and expect to watch it again and again.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|So in-depth. Loved and hated that there were so many characters and so many points of view. I was left with a sense of excitement, anticipation, and mistrust on so many levels. I hope the next book makes it all worth it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The storyline was great, the plot interesting & intriguing.  I like that the crux of the story isn't revealed until the end of the book.  This is definitely worth your time.
B0013Y1GEQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother sense she lost her DVD copy and she absolutely loves it. The transfer from DVD to Blu-ray with this particular film is a lot brighter and the movements are very crisp. Even I was enamored by the aesthetics of this film.
1401309666|5.0|I have read this book and have thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />His ideas are more true now than when he wrote the book back in 2006. In my opinion, the idea of the &#34;long tail&#34; has gone from a simple hypothesis back then to a widely accepted theory now. I would encourage anyone who is studying niche-economics to pick up a copy of this book and read it from cover to cover.
B003IY48PS|5.0|Holy crap! This film looks amazing on Blu-ray, it's not grainy and all the reds stand out in vibrant red and not pink. If you are a huge fan of &#34;The Evil Dead&#34;, and own everything else anyway, go ahead and buy this, you won't regret it. On top of that, they restored the film to it's original format in 1981, you see the film just as it would be in a Drive-in Theater.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This was a funny book. I laughed a lot and enjoyed it. Tina Fey is definitely a very witty and clever lady. This book can give you some pointers on how to deal with business and diversity.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|The book is very much like the style of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. These two authors have a flare for understating the doom of society while getting across the humanity of it by getting you to laugh about the entire thing. It isn't about religion or even about good versus evil as much as simply knowing who and what we are for most. I can see why this has become a cult classic.
B0090SVDUO|5.0|This edition is really good and it´s better than  bootlegs you could hear out there. The mastering and production by Bosnick is very brilliant.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|can't. stop. playing!  My kids get mad because I don't let them play lol.  Dear Princess Celestia, please keep up the good work
0486450066|1.0|Before people start throwing rocks on me, pls let me clarify:<br />1) On a time when people blindly believed God created every creature the way they look today, it would be insane to consider the evolutionary theory;<br />2) In this aspect, I admire the courage of Darwin to defy the religious bigotry and society by publishing his ideas;<br />3) I admire his perfect logic, putting the pieces of this gigantic puzzle together and finally realizing the link between all living beings, both contemporary and long gone - without this, we would still be blind believers;<br />4) He took extreme care to build up his ideas and the epiphany that followed, so that people could understand, by means of countless examples, how evolution took place;<br />5) Because of this walking-on-egg-shells, the book gets EXTREMELY LONG AND BORING: Darwin excuses himself way too many times, the examples are repetitive, and many chapters are recollections of other chapters;<br />6) So, reading the book in today's context is painful: you would have to set your mind back to 1800 and never heard of natural selection before, to fully appreciate this reading.
B004132HZS|5.0|Great gift.  Intriguing stories.  The stories refer to many of the original Holmes but the updated technology aspect adds to the captivation level.
B005LAIIGC|4.0|My kids love this movie. They enjoyed seeing how all these different characters got mixed together into one new story.
B00AJN90LS|5.0|Love Letter is a great 2-4 player bluffing/guessing game.<br /><br />Each player has a \\"hand\\" of 1 card. On your turn, you draw a card and then play/discard one of your two cards. Different cards allow you to attempt to guess what other people have to eliminate them, compare your remaining card with another player's, protect yourself from attacks, trade hands, etc. The goal of each round is to be either the last person standing, or to have the highest-ranked card when the draw pile is empty. Each round takes approximately 2-3 minutes, and each game (first to 5 points) takes approximately half an hour.<br /><br />This is a game that pretty much anyone over the age of 5 could play. The rules are so simple and yet so engaging.<br /><br />Game components are:<br />- 16 cards<br />- 13 cubes (for keeping track of score)<br />- velvet drawstring bag for holding the pieces<br /><br />The only downside to the game is the quality of the cards. They take scratches fairly easily, which could lead to unintentionally \\"marked\\" cards. I would strongly advise that you get sleeves to protect them, but if you do so make sure you get the right sized sleeves: these are not \\"standard\\" poker- or bridge- sized cards, but a European game size.
B008035H16|2.0|Although the cartoon format is intended to make the book easy to read I found this the opposite. It also did not zoom easily
0307742997|4.0|This is another Harry Hole serial murder mystery whereby woman go missing and the killer leaves his mark by leaving a snowman.<br /><br />Harry investigates and ties the serial killer to past disappearances.<br /><br />If you shortcut to chapter 33 then the killer and all is revealled.<br /><br />The plot is good and the story is fast moving.At three different times Harry thought he had the killer but was wrong.<br /><br />It is easy to lose track as so much happens that you must follow everything that is going on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever fun im glad u can play 4 players or 2 its fun playing with my brother and we made a wipeout zone
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I almost didn't buy this book. After reading reviews on GoodReads, people made it seem as though it was more than someone could handle. I thought it was perfectly done. The way the story is written is great. Looking at a situation from two different time periods that completely match in the build up is exciting. The book also made me feel the main character's frustration while also making you question what's really going on.  It also makes you wonder what if this happened to you?
B001EOOQF6|5.0|I LOVE THIS release.. STILL.. after 32 years ( 1981 )<br />This Cd. Still sends chills, and goose bumps.. in the best of all possible ways..<br />This to me, was Tony, Geezer, Carmine Appice, and DIO.. were ALL at the TOP of their game..<br />This Recording has stood the test of time, and is as fresh, and relevant NOW,.. as ever.<br />ALSO.. do yourself a favor and Check out ((Heaven and Hell)).
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|great mouse regardless of price. I use this mouse for gaming and the buttons are very responsible and it was easy to set up. I like it a lot.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book seems to be not everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />The characters were interesting to me, and their duality or plurality or dodecahedronality of existence was a transportation to multiple worlds that intrigued me.<br />I was sad to see the book end.<br />I think if you just open the book, and relax about whether it's good or great or monumental or just diversionary, you'll enjoy it. If you find yourself judging it as you go, you're probably going to be in the group that don't care for it.<br /><br />But why did I like it so much? It trips over its own honor. It bespeaks its own clumsy attempts at understanding of a world beyond itself, or within itself, or under itself. The man that is Shadow is like the distillation of the human will and the desire to do well in a universe that is shades of grey, or intentionally misleading, or simply unfathomable. Do the right thing. But what is that?<br /><br />by debunking myth and religion, Gaiman accidentally reveres and stands in awe of it. Every night when I reopened the book and picked up from where I left off, I was comfortably reinserted into this world.<br /><br />It's written brilliantly. The seemingly pointless diversions into different worlds and characters is not really pointless. The multiplicity of them IS the point.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, but I also advise the reader to just go along for the ride, and choose to believe, as Shadow did. If you get on that magic merry goround, just remember its ok to be a tourist in a strange land.

B009POCG0Y|1.0|This was so below standard for Matthew Mcconaughey.  Never would have expected this. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible-hated this movie-put in the trash category

B00ANGICRE|5.0|A poet in an iron lung is looking to have sex for the first time in his life. This sounds like a mix of a Lifetime Movie of the Week and a raunchy Judd Apatow sex comedy, but it's the furthest thing from both. Director Ben Lewin and amazing performances by its leads and supporting cast have crafted a mature, frank and life-affirming film about living a complete life; spiritually, emotionally, and physically.<br /><br />The film itself, set in 1988, is based on the real-life story and writings of Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes, who, after being in small roles for the last 15-odd years, has been making a significant name for himself lately in indies like WINTER'S BONE and MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE), a Berkeley area poet and writer who, after stricken with polio as a child, spent most of his life in an iron lung. He's never had a girlfriend and, aside from his assistants, lives a very solitary life. He does also lead a spiritual life, though, and often confides in his parish priest, Father Brendan (a wonderful William H. Macy). He falls in love with one of his assistants, the beautiful Amanda (Annika Marks), but she doesn't or can't reciprocate. He is called on by the magazine he writes for to get an article about sex and the disabled. He hires a new stone-faced, yet compassionate assistant, Vera (Moon Bloodgood of TERMINATOR: SALVATION and TV's BURN NOTICE), who helps him with his interviews. He then realizes that he desires the closeness and the intimacy of sex, which might then lead to the closeness and intimacy of love. He enters into a professional relationship with a sex surrogate, Cheryl (Helen Hunt, who has been MIA of late), who looks to help him with his unique challenge, but becomes professionally conflicted when she sees his soul laid bare as she helps him explore his still burgeoning sexuality.<br /><br />While this isn't a particularly amazingly visual film, flair is not necessary when you have a film that is packed to the hilt with strong and vital performances, powerful, funny and real dialogue, and a performance like Hawkes's to build around. His performance is flawless; there isn't a single note of his work in this film that you don't believe or don't see him vanish into the persona and physicality of O'Brien, and it still surprises me that he didn't make the cut for one of the actors in Oscar-nominated roles in 2012. It helps to make the strong performers around him that much stronger. Hunt, who I felt for quite some time was overrated as anything other than a sitcom actress, is absolutely stunning here as Cheryl. She never over-extends into a realm of melodrama, which it could have easily done. She's not quite in the same ballpark as Hawkes is, but it certainly close. Macy continues a streak of great supporting performances as the practical, down-to-earth Father Brendan. He's the kind of priest that everyone wished they had. Credit is also deserved my Bloodgood, Marks, Adam Arkin (as Cheryl's philosopher husband), W. Earl Brown (whose been in just about every film and TV show in the last fifteen years) as Mark's nighttime assistant and Rhea Perlman as the Mikvah Lady.<br /><br />Lewin never allows the film to get bogged down in the more melodramatic elements of the film and continues to show Mark's life as well as Cheryl's as their feelings begin to circle around each other's orbit as he sees her as a surrogate for all of his intimacy needs and she sees him as a true innocent and romantic. The film is also peppered throughout by some breezy comedy that never comes across as forced and a sense that all things are possible. The scenes of sexuality and nudity, and the narration of the events, are graphic, but more importantly, they're dealt with with frankness and a tenderness that few films about sexual experience are.<br /><br />THE SESSIONS is one of those great films that goes under many people's radar, but once you see it, you'll realize that this is one of the best films of 2012 and a woefully underseen and underrated and undeniably beautiful film.rated and undeniably beautiful film.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Can you say it's time to duel this reminds me of a game cartoon show called yugioh almost liked it then but I c what was going. On in th cartoon overall a good game
B001O1O71C|5.0|Loved it! The storyline was really excellent and it kept your interest through the whole story. I read a lot of books and it was one that I would highly recommend.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Series 1 of Doctor Who is fabulous but I am pretty sure everyone knows that anyway so I won't bother to review it.  The extras on this package make it well worth the money.  Great commentaries & lots of behind the scenes stuff.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is pretty fun. The graphics are beautiful. I wish you could sell back unwanted coral, etc. And I wish you could earn more pearls.
B0015XHQTY|4.0|This is a great Dirty Harry movie as usual.  Just as good as it was when it first came out.
B000BZISTO|5.0|This movie is suspenseful and romantic, and overall just a really great movie! This is a little bit of an older movie, but I'm a teenager and I cant tell you how many times I have watched this movie! :) I suggest it to anyone looking for a movie that has some suspense and even some romance. Not to mention wonderful actors! I really think you will enjoy this movie!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm a fan of Lord Of The Rings,,, Book first and then Movies.... Can't wait for part 2.... It should be another hit... I'm going for the whole set....
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Totally worth the buy, I loved how the graphics are so clear.  It makes me feel like I am really in OZ
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The first time I sat down and listened to the whole CD.... I thought it was great... I'm going to order more of her CD's....
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I became obbessed with this game in high school but I always played the free online verison so, to be able to have the full verison makes me so happy!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I really enjoy this series, its to bad you have to pay to much money to get the program to watch the series... That's why I buy DVD... Besides it worth to start the series collection....
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|good game overall though would recommend to others the suits r cool and the weapons are bad Ase takes a while to unlock anything though
B00991TCOG|5.0|I really like her style of music....  Very gifted... I would like to see her play with other musicians.... Or maybe singers....
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This should have won best picture.  The acting, set design, dialoge, everything was just perfect.  This is a funny, clever, brutal film that has a terrific ending.<br /><br />Yahoo to Quentin Tarantino for watching all those movies instead of going to school.  He is by far the best writer/director of all time.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I had listened to the audio book while I was at work, and I fell in love with the story. So when the movie came out, I was excited to see how it was adapted. I was stunned. The movie wasn't even close to the book. There was barely sign of the book anywhere in the story. They had took a few key dialogues and threw the novel away. I was actually very upset by it. I am aware that the book and the movie couldn't be identical, and something needed to cut out since the book was so large, but this was...horrifying.<br /><br />So I took a step back, and thought of it as a movie and disregarded the book. As a movie, it was decent, and for a two hour movie, it went surprisingly fast. It is a fun movie as long as you don't expect Oscar worthy material. Overall, I did like the movie, but as a fan of the book, I feel applaud.<br /><br />If you read the book, I would skip it. If you haven't, then I recommend watching it to kill a couple hours.
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|If you want an uplifting yet thoughtful film with some great laughs, this is it!  The movie lasted with me for several days and I would recommend this to anyone that likes drama.  The dialogue is good and the two actors were terrific along with a strong supporting cast.  I will watch it again.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Christopher Nolan 'Dark Knight' trilogy...but, nowhere is it written that all legends have to be dark paths to redemption. Sometimes, the greatest myths and legends are simply the kind of tales that demand to be re-told...generation after generation.<br /><br />Joss Whedon's 'Avengers' ascends the icy slopes of the superhero Olympus; and lays claim to that pinnacle and its throne.<br />There are layers of earthbound and extraterrestrial treachery threatening the human race; but, their potential saviors often distracted (and, hilariously) by a variety of rivalries that run the gamut from sibling, to battle of the sexes all the way to 'my hammer's bigger than yours'.<br /><br />What makes this cocktail really fizz are the expert proportions poured by Director Whedon: the cold calculations of Hawkeye and Black Widow, duplicity of Nick Fury and Loki, the stalwart heroisms of Captain America and Thor, wild card unpredictability that is the Hulk and the champagne patter of Iron Man make for a highly addictive and intoxicating mix.<br /><br />The talented cast rises to the the challeng of a witty, juggernaut script; and, the final elements of eye-tickling effects and a rousing score are what all combine to earn my (very rare) perfect 5-star score.<br /><br />Its a rare movie that makes me feel absolutely satisfied at the end; while immediately yearning for the next adventure. &#34;The Avengers&#34; is truly the stuff of legends.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've always had difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. This app allows me to combine sounds that typically have a soothing effect. You can set a timer and check the box for the app to close itself once the timer goes off. I've been sleeping a great deal better and I'm actually having an easier time falling asleep. Recommend for those who have trouble falling asleep without some sort of music or easy noise.
0525478817|5.0|This is a great read and I think anyone would enjoy it. It is a very lovely work of fiction.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I've been looking all over for this movie on DVD and haven't had any luck. We don't have a 3D TV and don't want one and that's the only version we've been able to find in this movie so I rented it on my tablet for a little while. VERY cute movie. Love it.
1451696191|5.0|This epistolary novel is an interesting book that I would recommend to just about anyone. It isn't too long of a book but it was very fun to read.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Rented this movie on my tablet and have to say, I enjoyed it. I look forward to downloading it permanently to my tablet in the future.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is awesome! A lot better than the previous dungeon hunters! story line wise!:) the only flaw I find is that there are less weapons and armorial but for a lot more money which is kinds hard on the player! other than that great game!:)
B004CURZFC|5.0|Rented this movie on my tablet out of curiousity. Was pleasantly surprised by it. Good inspiring movie that kids and adults alike will enjoy.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Excellent Product and Service
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|this is a failure. it wont install!! its such a shame because this game looked awesome. but nooooooo! that's too bad.! I don't reccomend this game to ANYBODY, well it installs but when it loads it goes back to homescreen. try it again, same thing.
B0012HRJEA|3.0|This is a type of movie that either you love or you hate it. The movie would not meet Shakespeare's intentions as it is more of a comedy than a tragedy. The movie seems to be making a mockery of Shakespeare's writing. The scene also has some cheesy scenes but overall it was funny. The acting seemed to be raw and the plot remained undeveloped. The director's modern interpretation of the play will appeal to younger audiences because of it's added humor but will be dry and annoying to Shakespeare fans. The character of Romeo seems to be portrayed well and does actually make him seemed like a confused boy. The interpretation of Mercutio was terrible and annoying. The movie will suite younger audiences who find the plot of Romeo and Juliet to be dry and clear-cut because this will be something they will be interested in. However, the play seems to portray Friar Lawrence as a villainous character and seems to blame him for the cause of Romeo and Juliet's death. The original play allows the reader to decide who they believe is at fault. The movie also seemed odd by the use of old English rather than modern day English. The play was modernized so it only seemed natural that the duologue should be modern. In summary, the play will soothe well with some audiences and annoy other audiences.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|AN AMAZING TRUE STORY.  IN FACT A BLACK FRIEND OF MINE BORROWED THE FILM AND NEVER RETURNED IT, THEY LIKED IT SO MUCH.  ITS AMAZING THAT SO MANY WHITE PEOPLE ENJOY THIS FILM AND HOW MANY BLACK PEOPLE NEVER EVEN HEARD ABOUT IT.  REMARKABLE FILM!
B008IGP8RI|5.0|the whole package delivered on time. secure packing. saw the film and enjoyed both the music and the film. thought had to get the album and I'm not disappointed.
B002CMXAYW|5.0|watching this movie now for the first time , although I grew up with the rock age, it is just remarkable. I sums up all the problems the different rock bands had over the years especially when one band member brings in a girlfriend, ( remember the Beatles and others  that broke up over girl friends in the group changing dynamics, and changes in rock managers etc and the problems with playing in crowds in non rock areas or (the Doors for example) here it is an air force base. Loved it. The costumes are modern even by today's standards.

Congrats Tom - it is a TOP album!<br />BUY IT folks, and let him know we appreciate his work!<br /><br />Gabor from Hungary (fan since '86)<br /><br />BTW The singing is great, no need for the raw voice on every track, you have a great sound for the ballads too :0)<br />Regards to the fellas as well!
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I found this film plot and story line rather flat, depressing and  pointless. It seemed to go nowhere and the ending was not much of one at all. Given that, the actors did what they could.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|there is way too much info out &#34;there&#34; without this place.  If my friends need me all they have to do is e-mail me.  Senseless.

B001EN71DG|5.0|I didn't even realize you could get the theatrical releases on DVD--thought I was going to have get a laserdisk player.<br /><br />I've got Stats Wars on Blu-ray, of course, but sometimes I just want to get away from all of the CG garbage and time-travel back to when these movies came out.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Makes it so much easier for babies to play with stuffed animal and suck on their bin kite at the same time.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I purchased this Skyfall Blu-ray dvd to add to our James Bond 50 Blu-ray set also purchased.  The James Bond 50 yrs collection left a slot, but the dvd was not available at the time the collection came out.  The movie is amazing and I had to get it to complete our set.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|So, I'm writing this on my kindle so I won't be writing a long and glorious thesis, but I thought that this tome deserved some praise. Obviously written in 5 parts, the different sections increase vastly in size as the collection moves on. The first section pays out as a wonderfully mind bending gotcha; it really sinks its teeth in and gets you wanting to read more. The second volume is quite a bit slower and tested my patience a bit, but once you meet Juliette, the volume becomes increasingly more page turny. The last two volumes are great. No annoying typos or formatting problems like a lot of the self published stuff I've read. Pick it up, it's a great deal and feels good to support burgeoning authors...
B0037A4ILC|5.0|superb mountain climbing sequences as Germany and Austria fall under the spell of the nazi party and a love story as well.

B009NG1Q96|1.0|I really don't understand why I read this book.The previous one, The Selection, was WAYYY below par. This one, while it was a teensy better than the first was still the pathetic book I read last year.<br /><br />Let's begin, shall we? There are spoilers so enter with caution.<br /><br />America- I hated her from the first book, and in this book, she's progessively gotten worse. When Maxon is doing you-know-what with Celeste, she gets pissed off! Hello? Aren't you cheating on Maxon yourself? Huh? Since when has she become JEALOUS of Maxon?<br /><br />I also hated how she stood up for Marlee, and then her FATHER said \\"Oh sugar bumpykins, I'm SOOOO PROUD! What the hell?????? She only stood up for Marlee because she's her best friend. Under no circumstances should you EVER say \\"I'm proud of you\\" when . It's MANDATORY that you stand up for best friend. If Celeste was caned like Marlee was, America wouldn't give a damn and cheer along with the crowd.<br /><br />AND THEN, she has the audacity to propose to REMOVE THE CASTE SYSTEM???? In front of the KING, QUEEN, AND PRINCE! That is an absolute NO NO! You can do that when you are the new princess. Part of winning the marraige of Maxon is not pissing off the King and Queen. Saying that the caste system should be removed is not a good idea when you want the hand of Maxon. HOORAY FOR KING CLARKSON FOR FINALLY HATING AMERICA! I'm so sick of people adoring her (with the obvious exception of Celeste)!<br /><br />The worldbuilding was crappy, as usual. Just a few diaries from Gregory Illia (i don't care whether i spelled it incorrectly) and Maxon describing the world isn't going to help me learn anything.<br /><br />OH MY GOD REBELS ARE HERE GET TO SAFETY NOW! That was pretty much what happened at least 4 times throught the book. Yet no major character gets injured or killed. It seems that the rebels are bad at attacking. Or maybe, the soldiers routed them. Either way, the rebels plot made absolutely no sense.<br /><br />And I'm not even going to get into the dumb love triangle or sloppy writing. They're just bad on all accounts.<br /><br />Would I reccomend it? Not on my watch unless you liked the first one or you LOVE dumb books like this.

B00003CX9E|1.0|This is billed as one of the best movies ever made which I think is totally wrong. It is barely better than a collection of headline newspaper stories. There is no story and the acting, well, there is no acting. In my opinion this is a total waste of time and money. After a few minutes running I fast forwarded through the whole thing. I definitely will not be keeping these disks.

076790592X|5.0|I leant this book to a friend who never finished or returned it and rather than ask for it back, hoping they will stumble upon it again someday and finish I just bought another copy for myself. Great book...that I will continue to share with others.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Not quite as good as the computer/Xbox 360 version, but what can I say?  It is a mobile edition.  Very nicely done, however, there are alot more updates before it could really compare to the full version.  Not bad for those on the go, however!
B005C9YZIW|5.0|We put this on for our 2 and 4 year olds and they love to watch the animals and learn about the different places on earth.  So beautiful.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I think that all the seasons are spectacular. They all build on each other.  Although at retail price all dvd's are overly expensive.

B004LWZW7O|5.0|I list it in my top 50 of all time. If you haven't seen it you will be amazed.  You can point out some flaws in the story line if you were picky, but overall it does human society a great justice
B006O6F932|3.0|This is a cute dollhouse, but it's a little more flimsy than I expected.  It is hard to stay &#34;together,&#34; and it wobbles when my 8 year old plays with it. That was a little disappointing.  But, it was easy to put together, colorful, and captures the essence of &#34;monster high&#34; that we were looking for.  Overall, it's ok... just wish it was more sturdy.
B000002OX7|4.0|obviously, the days of sex, drugs, and rock and roll were just getting started when this master piece was minted. if you are a fan or original rock music, it is pretty much necessary to get this record.

B000AXWV40|5.0|some of the best, most original music i have ever heard. the guitar is hauntingly beautiful. truly a group ahead of their time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second novel was outstanding, the mask ball, the ex- girl, the things they enjoyed together and the confession, this was reverting and I am glad there is a 3rd novel great writing.  What is next after fifty shades, please write more of Christian &Anna  or 2 new couples, good reading to cuddle up with
B007A2O3FO|4.0|I have been a huge fan of L. M. Boston for a long time and this movie is very different than The Treasure/Chimneys of Green Knowe.  For instance, Tolley is older and the relationships are more complicated.  I also felt that showing Green Knowe mostly in winter didn't allow the setting to shine.  (The house seems a little depressing, but I think the movie is going for the spooky factor.)  If you know about these differences when you sit down to watch it, you can instead simply enjoy the movie for what it is.  I felt the lessons and conclusions of the movie jibe well with Boston's values.  To me, the movie story is fan fiction.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I was naturally apprehensive about Matt Smith taking David Tennant's place as The Doctor, but once again I am more than pleased with the results. The Eleventh Doctor's mannerisms and nuances are delivered with such finesse and outright hilarity. Smith's performances touch the heart and allow one to fall in love with The Raggedy Doctor again and again. Season five continues to go above and beyond my expectations on so many levels. I have indeed experienced every emotion on the spectrum while watching this television series and I certainly cannot say that for any other. If you haven't given Doctor Who a chance, please do so. Any science fiction lover can appreciate the sheer beauty and genius that emanates from the Last of the Time Lords.<br /><br />Geronimo!
B005S9EJ14|1.0|I received this movie and was looking forward to watching it but it won't play past the premiere start up.I would also like this movie replaced.
0316143472|5.0|This was the first of the rash of David Sedaris I read since it was referred to me by a friend. He is hilarious, and has the best anecdotes! It's a fantastic series to read over and over again. Feeds your inner child and outer cynic.
B0032W5H9C|2.0|Wasn't expecting such blatant propaganda. I thought it might be something fresh and intelligent and perhaps slightly counter-culture...perhaps something slightly evolved.....I was very wrong.

B00001PE4D|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out and i still love it. It's one of those movies that never gets old no matter how many times you've seen it.

B007ZBWJXI|5.0|I bought this album after seeing their 30 year reunion tour. They performed many of the songs from this album at the concert and I liked them right away. Great musical skill teamed with great lyrics. A very, very good album!
B003UYV08E|4.0|Not a bad flick if you've got two hours to kill. Being a superhero movie, we all know that Tony Stark as Iron Man is going to win at the end, of course. However, the single disc DVD has a commentary by director Jon Favreau, who says a lot of things about the movie. I liked seeing Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansen, and it goes without saying I love seeing Gwyneth Paltrow. However, seeing Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Mickey Roarke acting in a movie that people are going to see! Killer soundtrack, too.

B005LAII12|5.0|I remember those little teddy bears that came out when the DVD came out. I kept thinking, &#34;I wonder if people who would NEVER see the movie would get those bears for Christmas.&#34; I gave a bunch to my family members, two to my cousins, some to my nieces...&#34;<br /><br />This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite some time. Wahlberg has always been hit or miss with me, but to be able to act with something that isn't there most of the time impressed me. He also had the opportunity to work with Mila Kunis, who has come a LONG way since that TV show. I have to give kudos to Seth McFarlane for writing and directing such a zany comedy. Of course, he was also the voice of Ted, so you have to blame him for some of foul mouth remarks. But, he was able to do a few things that not many people can. One, was digging up Sam Jones and the movie Flash Gordon. Two, was showing a clip from the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and three, getting Mark Wahlberg to sing on stage with Norah Jones' band. He could have been singing out of tune on purpose, and probably was. But, to the generation which remembers Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, I guess this is what old rappers sound like when they attempt to sing.<br /><br /> To top it off, both of my nieces have the middle name Lynn, as does their mother!
159562015X|5.0|This book focuses on your talents versus placing you in a category.  Good complement to many of the style, personality or core value assessments.  The focus in on the &#34;how&#34; you show up in the work place.  Great to use as a team builder.
B0093Q9SCS|5.0|One of my favorites! Gerard Butler is a doll in here and Hilary Swank is adorable! I would recommend it anytime!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a fantastic little game. Its easy enough and takes up no time at all. Not one of those demanding games that punish you by having crops wither or something if you don't play within a certain amount of time. I appreciate this game.
B005IQZB14|4.0|The author writes very well. The story is engaging and very descriptive. I found at times it dragged out a bit though.
B000002N3N|5.0|I love Enya!  I especially love the songs on this recording.  It is a connection that I feel to my brother as he loved his garden, but this is part of our Irish heritage.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I have this MOVIE on DVD. The BluRay version is so much better that seeing it was better than the first time!
B008476HBM|5.0|Hence I am giving it 5 stars - wonderful to read with the English Language<br />and usage of words<br />Feel more should follow the use of words and meaning instead of using<br />such unnecassary language which to many is offensive where to  have a<br />better knowledge of the usage of words more readily available!!
