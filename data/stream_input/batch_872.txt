B000FJGWBM|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  It's thrilling, mind-bending and makes you think and question the story just like Guy Pearce's character.  The icing on the cake is that it's presented with a crystal clear picture.  I usually care just about the movie, but this disc could've used a little more extras.
0956010903|5.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Collector's Edition (Offered Exclusively by Amazon)     I purchased two of these books for gifts and they are truly worth the money spent for the Collector's Edition, a very nice addition to any harry potter collection!
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Three of my favorite movies all in  their HD glory.  These movies are spectacular and layered, you'll want to watch all three in a row.  I usually care just about the movie but there are tons of extras such as deleted scenes, commentaries, character bios and inside looks at how scenes were filmed.  The case is pretty cool, too.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I loved this book.  It has an intricate plot and is beautifully written.  I wish it didn't have to end.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Love it. Both the CD and the video DVD. Especially the video DVD.   For Stevie Nicks lovers this set is a must have.
0439680093|1.0|This book climaxes in a black mass, with all the trappings of child sacrifice, a backward Lord's Prayer, and an upside down cross, and for a really modern twist, a nuclear explosion thrown in. Maybe the vast majority of parents are OK with that but I'm not.  Contrary to some reviewers characterizations, this is NOT in the line of Harry Potter.  Though in a fictional setting, this book deals with historically accurate occult, satanist and witchcraft themes and practices (it is not in the light fantasy genre of Harry Potter, but much more like Stephen King).  And as a side note, like most books in this age group, is pathetically simplistic in its grammar and writing style (again, unlike Harry Potter).    I'm a Catholic and happen to believe in evil (I know, how quaint)and I don't appreciate Scholastic introducing my young children to these dark themes (my 10 year old picked it up from her Catholic school library and read 1/2 way through before I had a chance to read it).     Can someone please explain to me why Scholastic thinks it's perfectly ok to have the story feature a Black Mass (which is a corrupt form of the Catholic mass used in satanic worship mocking Christ's sacrifice) but totally not okay for the protagonist to use Christianity to combat evil? What's hysterical is this book is that at the climax of the book right when Matt the young boy protagonist is having the knife plunged into him by a witch, he suddenly gets overwhelming power and is able to overpower his enemies. There's no explanation of where the power comes from, but I'm certain it's not Christianity (oh no - that would be way too preachy) particularly when Christianity is never even referenced in the book except through references to the Black Mass.      Lest you think I'm a religious reactionary, I've read the entire Harry Potter series and appreciated it for its humor and entertainment, though I wouldn't call it a masterpiece as some might. I think the Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest(the writer of which by the way was Catholic).  So I appreciate fictional magic, but not fictional occultist practices, particularly when aimed at our young children.     If you are a parent concerned about exposing your children to occultist themes, or a child who wants to enjoy their childhood and not darken it with the perversions of modern day publishers, this book is not for you.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I just started working out at home (duh--who needs a gym?) I don't have a TV, so I wasn't familiar with Jillian Michaels from \\"The Biggest Loser.\\" The workouts are great--a nice progression of easy-to-learn, tough-to-master moves--and they get very challenging in the second and third levels. After nine or ten viewings, Jillian's personality really started to wear on me. It's not so much about health for her as it is about appearance and \\"jeans shopping.\\" She's just sort of grating and bossy. So, now I watch the videos with the sound off and listen to my own music (workout video music seems to suck universally). Much nicer. I recommend this video for the workout but you might want to mix it up with some more friendly instructors.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Okay - let's not split hairs. Tim Burton's screen adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's stage-musical thriller `Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street' is a pitch-black, bloody masterpiece.    With this film, both Burton and his longtime cinematic collaborator, Johnny Depp, have found a new voice. And, in Mr. Depp's case, quite literally. Safe to say that 'Sweeney' is like nothing either of them has ever done before. Not by a mile.    And no one was more surprised than I.    Though an admirer of much, if not all, of the work Burton and Depp have co-created, when it comes to this musical - one I've passionately appreciated ever since I saw the original Broadway cast - I must confess that I feared the worst. Namely, that both Burton and Depp would accentuate the whimsically macabre, campy aspects inherent in the story (admittedly, a melodrama, after all) to the detriment of the core essence of relentless, escalating, bone-chilling terror and pity -- the key ingredients of classic tragedy.    But not so.  Thank God.    In fact, this film is surprisingly faithful to the glowering, sinister, painful, and at times hilariously dark heart of Sondheim's classic masterwork of tonsorial terror. And while not lost in any way, the very dark (and very necessary) humor is deftly balanced here against the howling bleakness, raging injustice, and just-plain-evil which stalk the twisted alleyways of Sweeney's world and revenge-hungry mind.     But, is it an utterly perfect movie? In a word: no. I can quibble with the elimination of the show's \\"theme song\\" -- the repeated, savagely witty chorus `The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd'. And the voices of the cast, technically speaking, are not always up to the rigorous, near operatic quality standards of many major productions of the live show.    But in the blood-streaked face of what Burton has achieved in this intimate epic, with its spectacularly seedy, yet perversely beautiful evocation of a Dickensian/Jack-The-Ripper London -- its stylized, near-monochromatic squalor shot through with sudden and, at times, shocking assaults of color - any negatives seem mere niggling in retrospect.    Without indulging in showiness for the sake of show, Burton has proven himself, more dazzlingly than ever, to be a technical conjuror, yet without losing sight of the quieter, subtler undercurrents throughout. He's as confident in his work with the actors and his marvelous staging of the many musical show-pieces, as he is with the compelling use of CG effects. (That opening-credits sequence alone is a stunner.)     This is a new, more mature artist at work here, fully in control of his minor-keyed palette. Though Burton has unmistakably worked his distinctive wizardry yet again, this time he's created a truly unified, seductively sinister fairy-tale like no other, somehow pretty and poisonous simultaneously.    Yet never was a fairy tale more truly Grimm!    And that's no idle warning, believe me.     No matter which way you slice it -- and Sweeney does it in all KINDS of ways -- this film was rated R for a VERY well deserved reason. Grand Guignol gore via throat-slashings galore are the order of the day in the morally askew funhouse world of  Mr. T and his partner/paramour in crime, Mrs. Lovett.    Speaking of whom, the sweetly sordid pie-maker herself is played to perverse perfection with threadbare, hauntingly droll, pastry-faced allure by Helena Bonham Carter, who is funnier and sings much better than I had feared might be the case, memorably putting her own depraved stamp on the role. As does everyone in the supporting cast, especially the deliciously decadent Judge Turpin of Alan Rickman and the obsequiously vile, rodent-like, beady-eyed Beadle of Timothy Spall. Oh, MAN, do you ever itch to see Sweeney go to work on these two! And go to work he does! But I get ahead of myself...    I would also be remiss in not making special mention of both Sascha Baron Cohen as the bogus barber Perelli in an enjoyable, broadlycomic turn, and Ed Sanders as his hapless, much put-upon young assistant (i.e. slave) Tobias - both of them perfection in their very different ways. And even the \\"straight\\" romantic characters are played and sung equally well by Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener, and Laura Michelle Kelly who, collectively, manage to sidestep the potential curse of cliché and/or blandness inherent in these tricky roles.     I was also impressed at the seamless streamlining of various story elements, in the process losing a few songs which, truly, never advanced the story in any crucial way onstage, but which would have proved a major impediment on the screen. And the restructuring of the scenes/songs which originally constituted the first half of Act Two, was pure inspiration, immeasurably increasing the film's storytelling effectiveness and propulsive energy.     But, as in any production of Sondheim's musical thriller, the ultimate power and essential emotional force of this story stands or falls on the strength of the actor playing Todd. And Depp's Sweeney is truly a revelation.     This is a Depp with newfound gravitas - his eyes and every gesture conveying a brooding, world-weary, soul-deep despair, and a potently unsettling undercurrent of simmering danger. All the layers and facets of this troubled and troubling character are laid bare in Depp's delicately gauged, fearless and fearful performance. And all the while maintaining a richly effective dialect which, along with the other details of his perfectly gauged portrayal, helps cement his Mr. T uniquely in one's memory long after the film has reached its tragically inevitable, pitifully chilling, blackly merciless conclusion.    Yeah, yeah. But how's his SINGING?     Well, very much to my surprise, unexpectedly effective. For, whatever Depp may lack in vocal virtuosity is made up for in spades by the power and range of his acting and the fact that he sings IN CHARACTER, utilizing his wonderfully growly, lower-class British dialect to marvelous effect - something no other stage Sweeney has done. And it works like mad. \\"Barking mad\\", to quote Mrs. Lovett. And though the role is usually sung by a baritone -- one further reason for my initial skepticism regarding Depp -- the switch to tenor was less jarring than I'd feared. And while the lighter vocal tone is admittedly less intimidating, the requisite demonic undercurrents are still very much in evidence, so all is far from lost.      And, lest I forget, the lush orchestrations of the talented Johnathan Tunick have never sounded more awe inspiring.    As a particularly delicious bonus, the 2-disc version of this DVD is packed as full as one of Mrs. Lovett's meat pies with wonderful special features on the background of the original show, the historical context of the original Sweeny Todd penny-dreadful & subsequent legend, and oodles of behind-the-scenes stuff on the making of the film.    Not necessarily the most logical of films for a Christmas release (I'm sure more than one Mr. and Mrs. Middle-America ran screaming from the local cineplex long before the end credits rolled -- there was, nevertheless, a certain bitter irony at work in that unconventional studio decision which, if to no one else, would certainly have brought an amused chuckle to Mr. Todd himself as he stared at his pallid reflection in one of his beloved razors and smiled. Like a knife.
B00004U45G|5.0|One of the best live albums I have! The sound quality is fantastic, almost like you're there.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Right up front, let me make clear that I'm only reviewing the FILM here -- as screened in THEATERS -- and NOT this specific DVD release:    Simply put, 'Let The Right One In' is a hauntingly beautiful gem -- a quiet little masterpiece -- and probably the best sound-era vampire film, in ANY language, EVER.    There have been, obviously, a staggering number of vampire-themed films in the history of cinema. And I added the term \\"sound-era\\" because of my equal admiration for both Murnau's 'Nosferatu' and Dryer's 'Vampyre'. But, since those early dark wonders, I'd be hard pressed to think of another film on the general theme of vampires which has the emotional depth or startling impact of this small-scale Swedish marvel.    And marvel I did at how sensitively and subtly and uniquely this oft-mined genre was handled in this very special case.     'Let The Right One In' is, decidedly, NOT your daddy's vampire flick. For this unique take on the genre is also as much a love story and coming-of-age drama as it is a vampire movie. Perhaps MORE so, as there is really less emphasis here on the specific details of vampirism -- though they are NOT shied away from either, as is shockingly evident in several memorably chilling sequences.    But it's really the brilliance of the direction, cinematography, writing, and, perhaps most of all, the superb performances of its two young leads which sets this movie apart, in terms of overall quality, from the majority of other films dealing with this theme.    Yet, perhaps the word \\"theme\\" is misleading in this instance. For if I had to pinpoint the true central theme of this refreshingly non-traditional vampire film, I'd have to say it was loneliness rather than blood sucking.     And it is precisely that thematic core, and how it is conveyed cinematically, which, more than anything else, gives this film its peculiar resonance and a securely high place in the history of sanguinary cinema.
B00005PJ6M|3.0|The movie was in good condition and my daughter loved it.  I think she watched it three times in two days
B001R4MEYS|5.0|Buy this now... I'm sure that Maynard likes this album....you must listen to this release with a good sound system....ear buds can't do justice to their huge and moving sound...........
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I brought this DVD for my daugther and she loved it!  She had seen Rent about a million times and buying it for her was a great gift!  We have seen it together a few times and I find that we break out in lines or songs from this movie at radom.  I love it too!!!
B000784WMW|4.0|There are a zillion versions of Jane Eyre and they  all fall short when compared to this one.  Timothy Dalton is a swash buckling Mr. Rochester.  Tall, dark and brooding.   Zelah Clarke is a petite, perfect foil.  I never try of this one.  It's as timeless as the romance itself.
B000VUFJ3C|4.0|I really like this CD.  This CD takes a dance vibe and kinda mixes it with the adult contemporary feel of their previous album.  Most of the songs here are good, sometimes even catchy.  I pop this in when I need a music pick-me-up.  Overall, you shouldn't be disappointed with this disc.
B0000019PA|5.0|In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the best album by NMH. My favorite song is Two Headed Boy (pt. 1 & 2) They really capture the music in this album.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new in their collection.<br /><br />Edit: Just purchased the vinyl to add to my collection, still an amazing album, great in LP form and great art.<br />LP seems warped just a little but it hasn't effected the playback.

B000WS4P5G|4.0|I'm mixed when it comes to Danzig.  I'm not very fond of him personally, but the man can sure write a song and sing, and this is easily his best release under the Danzig moniker.<br /><br />The songs on here have a polished rawness to them you don't get on his future releases, and he seems to channel Elvis at all the right times.  That's the same thing that made the Misfits' \\"Legacy of Brutality\\" so great.<br /><br />If you aren't hooked by the first guitar riff, you really aren't paying attention.  You know then and there that Danzig is rewriting his music history, and is doing exactly what he wants regardless of what the fans desired.  You have to admire that.  Fortunately, what he made was entirely rocking, which may be in part to Rick Rubin.  Can't say for sure, but I think that was definitely an influence.<br /><br />This release never gets old, and will stand the test of time like few others of his.  Guaranteed not to disappoint Danzig and rock fans.
031606792X|1.0|Of course insecure teenage girls are going to love this but what is stephanie meyer really trying to teach here. This books is horrible, the writing is horrible and the story just gets convoluted. Out of all the books, Twilight was her best one and it wasn't even that great, the only reason this series has boomed like halo was because it was written for the perfect market where anyone can make a lot of money. All these impressionable  and clueless teens who actually buy this stuff along with a jonas brothers album and then call themselves rockers. Anyway, from the four books, this was the biggest letdown. Stephanie leaves the readers and fans of the series, yet again confused, asking more questions, and brainwashed. Some parts don't even make sense but if eventually you forget about it because of all the sex and unrealistic romantic love going on. Who cares that she was into that one guy just a minute ago right, ignore that and enjoy this new chapter about how much a still love you even though I kinda just cheated on you..yea this story is so deep and great.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I had wanted to see this film because it was a true story from the late 20's.  All I knew it was about a missing child.  What I didnt know was how corrupt the LA police force was back then, nor did I know the story about Gordon Stuart Northcott.  After watching this film I wanted to know more about Northcott, so I read the book \\"Nothing Is Strange With You\\".<br />I think many folks will be surprised if they look into Northcotts life, and realize that he was not the \\"monster\\" as shown in \\"Changeling\\", but rather just a spoiled, mixed up 20 yr old kid. Its a strange case that few have ever heard of till now.
B000089RVR|5.0|This album is a great followup to \\"No Angel\\" and she has shown a lot of maturity as a singer-songwriter. Dido possesses a very unique voice that complements her style of songs very well. Great album to wind down at the end of the day or to laze around on a weekend/vacation day with a book. Some tracks like \\"White flag\\", \\"Life for rent\\", \\"See the sun\\" are simply outstanding. Overall, a terrific effort by Dido and I would highly recommend it.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|A unique and fascinating take on the vampire myth.  A must for all fans of vampire literature.
1932907009|4.0|\\"Save the Cat\\" is simplistic almost to a fault. The examples the author offers to aspiring writers include \\"Aladdin\\" \\"Four Christmas'\\" \\"Legally Blond\\" and \\"Blank Check.\\" While from a structure and character standpoint, these stories are good to learn by, it is NOT something I would ask EVERYONE to try to mimic. At the same time, the author takes a jab at the AFI Award Winner for Screenwriting \\"Memento.\\" For me, it is impossible to compare \\"Blank Check\\" and \\"Memento\\" and while everyone can't and won't write \\"Memento,\\" I don't think the mindless drivel of the other examples are something we want to flood Hollywood with.     However, for the beginner, this book is GREAT! It precisely lays out structure, story, hook, premise, and irony with easy to remember terms and shows you how to write a great logline to entice producers and agents. This should be your starting point but not your ending point. Make sure to follow up by reading as many screenplays as possible (and maybe NOT the four examples above if they don't interest you). Write what you like, not what is successful in Hollywood.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This is great old-fashioned moviemaking. I thought I was watching some epic film of the past: sweeping vistas, corny-but-nice tugs on our emotions, a real romance and good people doing the right things.  Add to that spectacular photography, colors and direction and you have a very entertaining and rewarding film.      It never overstays its welcome, even at 165 minutes, with just the right mix of adventure, romance, drama and mystery.    Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fit like a glover for a romantic although, as usual in films, they fall for each other a little quicker than normal.  This story is equally a romance and a racial one. The latter comes into play with a \\"creamy,\\" a child whose parents were black and white and so the kid has no identity (although he leads toward his Aborginal grandpa)    Brandon Walters plays the boy, the center of attention in the film and every bit a star as Kidman and Jackman in here.  He is \\"Nullah,\\" who also narrates the film.  He is a charmer; no question about that!    It's nice to see Bryan Brown again. For those who had forgotton, he was was \\"Rollie Tyler,\\" the star of the very successful \\"F/X\\" movies, about 20 years.  The last I had seen Brown was in a neat little film called \\"The Last Hit,\\" a made-for-TV film in 1983.  In `Australian,\\" Brown's character in another fascinating guy:  \\"King Carney.\\"    As wonderful as this old-fashioned tale is, perhaps the real stars are Director Baz Luhrmann and Cinematographer Mandy Walker.  They will stun you with the visuals in this movie, start-to-finish, with both real and enchanced shots that are always eye-opening.
B001ATDEJY|4.0|I feel this is a must have for any Thin Lizzy Fan. A couple area's on the disc sound a bit wavy but I'm not sure why. It's probably from how it was edited. Overall I feel it was a good purchase.
1569474680|2.0|It was just an ok book. It seemed to drag on the whole first half of the book then it finally started getting good, kinda disturbing, the husband was a little morbid. She starts to have feelings with this detective but at the end of the book...bam thats it. I will def. donate this book to a thrift store, I wouldn't put it in my library to look at or read again.

B000002OX3|3.0|1966's \\"A Quick One\\" would be the second album for The Who, which would follow up the very impressive Debut \\"The Who Sings My Generation\\" Even though I originally gave the debut album 3 1/2 Stars, but deserved better, more like 4 1/2 Stars, as almost every song on the album shines, with expection of a few over bubblegum type songs, but even still, the band showed that it was pretty much ahead of its time. You would have thought the band would have progressed a bit more, but it really wasnt until 1969's Tommy, that the band would reach PERFECTION. A Quick one is a bit of a disspointment since it contains 20tracks, and out of 20, I say that I only liked 10. The album is riddled with ridiculous bubblegum and corney songs, and you would have thought there would have been alot more on the first album, then this. Now, keep in mind that some people like \\"That Bubblegum Sound\\" from the 60's, but I think The Who was at its best when laying down hard rock bluesy type anthems, and beautiful Ballads (such as the amazing This Song is Over) Its just hard to picture a band that was smashing up its instruments and I believe was the beginning of \\"Heavy Metal Music Theatrics\\" with of course he Likes of Henrix, would have so much of this rubbish on its the album. Still, its got some great stuff on here, just to bad that its not enough, and the album doesnt exactly flow well, just as your hear something like Run Run Run or See My Way, you are haunted by two, sometimes three lousy songs in a row. \\"Sellout\\", the next Who album, is much better, and even though corney at times, it was released as a \\"concept\\" album, and its song quality is better. Out of the First Four Who Albums, \\"Happy Jack\\" is a disspointment. Theres is just not enough to keep it from becoming a classic Milestone from The Who.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|Chris Cornell has long been one of my favorite vocalists.  On everything from \\"Burden in My Hand,\\" \\"Sunshower,\\" \\"Cochise,\\" and all in between.<br /><br />I a more of a rock,grunge,alternative fan...but can occasionally appreciate the beats of Timbaland and the like.  I've liked a lot of the Timbaland team-ups from the past few years, Nelly Furtado, One Republic, and even some Justin Timberlake.<br /><br />So when I heard he was teaming up with Cornell, I was stoked.<br /><br />I just purchased it this week and have listened trough it.  It'll take a few listens to appreciate the album as a whole.  As it is for me with most albums.<br /><br />This is a great departure from Cornell's past work, but it still bears his singular voice.  Albiet not as powerful as usual, but it works for the songs.  Considering this project was originally going to be remixes of past songs with a Timbaland twist, I like the overall feel of it.<br /><br />Time, Never Far Away, Scream, and  Enemy are the stand out songs for me at this point.  Enemy more than most.<br /><br />The only song that will probably get skipped regularly is Part of Me.<br /><br />Yes it is very different and not what you'd expect from Cornell.  But I admire his courage and curiosity with music.  This was an interesting experiment that shouldn't be tossed aside just because it's lacking raging guitars.<br /><br />With that in mind, it is not for everyone.<br /><br />I personally will enjoy it, but I'll eagerly anticipate another rock album any time.

045122499X|5.0|I don't care about a little mistake like what they called the Plague during that time period, I care about a great, entertaining story.  If I wanted a history lesson, I'd read nonfiction.  I love the way this guy writes.  He doesn't waste time and pages and gets right to the good stuff.  I enjoyed the exaggerated characters like Godwyn and Philemon.  I enjoyed the fact that Caris was a bit of a ball buster.  The story was great and the sex fit in well.  I loved P of E and wasn't sure I could like a guy who wasn't Jack Builder but learned to love Merthin.  You can also be thankful that medical research has come so far since then.
B000M4RG4C|2.0|My favorie actor is Clint Eastwood.  My favorite theme is World War 2 movies.  This movie however just does not speak to me.  The movie is slow and while it paints a picture of realism sometimes the viewer needs a bit of the far fetched.  I found myself longing for for the very good fight scenes and sitting waiding through all the other garbage surrounding th flag berrors.        Now the the second movie letters from Iwo Gima - the Second movie in this 2 movie set, I give 5 star review.  It is truly an amazing human struggle story.  Clint really pulled that movie off well.  You be the judge, I own this movie and have only wathed it 2 times.  I own Letters, and still watch it time to time

B000LXH0AE|2.0|Less a story or cinematic experience, \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is scarcely more than a flimsy premise for a weak romantic comedy, ultimately distinguished by a didactic voice-over that seems to go on moralizing forever at the film's end.  As a romantic comedy, the film succeeds to the degree the viewer finds Harold Crick's life story as interesting as Will Farrell's persona.  To reviewers not particularly drawn to  Farrell's understated role, his conflict between a life controlled by a digital wrist watch vs. one proceeding from his own free and autonomous will is what the film comes down to.  Of course, as a parable it attempts to make some \\"deeper\\" statement about the tragic narratives we regrettably mistake for the banality of actual living which, though no more profound than a bad rock & roll lyric, is something we can be grateful for: after all, it's \\"real life.\\"  Deal with it, and forget about living the fictionalized existence of some protagonist in a heightened, tragic drama. (It's at this point that the screenplay tries--far too hard and to an embarrassing degree--to excuse itself from looking \\"anti-cultural.\\")<br /><br />For some viewers, Harold's salvation from his automated routine will be sufficient pay-off to make his mundane existence (now spiced up by his slightly wild and tattooed but sweet, newfound love) seem exceedingly preferable to the extermination of the artist and her pretentious fictional \\"masterpieces.\\"  But certainly there is nothing in the film more believable and disturbing than the self-destructive, neurotic-verging-on-psychotic Emma Thompson (she's Peter O'Toole more hung over than usual!) as the \\"great author\\"--until she shows up at the end of the film cleaned-up, repentant, well-groomed and gentle spoken--saved, presumably, from her own creative vices.<br /><br />The moral of the story?  Simply this: \\"you're lucky to be alive.\\"  And that's more than you could say for Lear, Othello, Macbeth, Hamlet, and Butterfly, all of whom are killed off by their creators.

B0000TG9E2|5.0|Arrived in great condition.  Enjoyed the video very much.  Brought back a lot of fond memories from seeing this as a child.  Arrived quickly.  Didn't expect to receive it so fast.  Was in excellent condition.  Would buy from this seller again.  Very pleased with purchase.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|There have been very few films that have really grabbed my emotions to the extent that the tears kept flowing after the movie had ended.<br /><br />FIELD OF DREAMS is one, as are PLACES IN THE HEART and John Huston's adaptation of James Joyce's THE DEAD. Now, director Stephen Daldry's film of Bernhard Schlink's best-selling novel, THE READER, joins that short list.<br /><br />Kate Winslet won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar for her performance in that post-Holocaust drama, but as much as I enjoyed SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, I think that THE READER should have won Best Picture also.<br /><br />This is a story that presents the Holocaust's war criminals as \\"human beings,\\" not the two-dimensional villainous figures that have populated other films about this horrible, tragic era.  By showing these characters as real people, we can (hopefully) understand their behavior, as evil and unforgivable as it might be.<br /><br />I'm not in any way suggesting that Winslet's acts should not be punished.  What she did was despicable.  Yet, you cannot put her in the same category as, say Hilter or even the Ralph Fiennes character in SCHINDLER'S LIST.  They were truly evil people who knew exactly what they were doing.<br /><br />It's no excuse, but Winslet's character committed her terrible acts out of, for lack of a better word, stupidity.<br /><br />Winslet plays Hannah, a woman who has a passionate summer affair with a much younger man, Michael (played at different ages by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes).<br /><br />After she suddenly disappears, Michael is confused, then she resurfaces years later as one of the defendants in a war crimes trial stemming from her actions as a concentration camp guard.<br /><br />Incidentally, the tears that I shed in this film were for Michael, not Hannah.<br /><br />The DVD from The Weinstein Company and Genius Products contains eleven deleted scenes, in-depth interviews/conversations with Daldry, Kross and Winslet, plus several other \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000TB01Y Wicked (2003 Original Broadway Cast)]]  Excellent soundtrack! We can hardly wait to see the show live! Wonderful voices, especially Kristin Chenoweth
B0000021S9|5.0|This is a great live record and as the set goes on the band starts to loosen up and jam a little more...  a prime example is extending the instrumental break of 25 Or 6 to 4 by roughly 4 minutes.<br /><br />This song is about being tired and edgy and Kath's guitar work conveys that restless uneasiness perfectly.  He works the wah wah like mad and his soloing really catches fire.  Sweet rendition, boys!<br /><br />The other numbers toward the end of the set (I'm a Man, Free) also have a loose edgy feel which is excellent and exactly how live rock should be performed.  Free is especially inpsired with fantastic drumming and horn solos.  Again, great record!<br /><br />One last note, Cetera's singing sounds a little rougher and hoarse than on the studio productions which is VERY refreshing.  His overly smooth high voice on the sappy saccharine ballads they became known for later still makes my skin crawl.  On this record he sounds more like a rock-n-roll singer...  imagine that!<br /><br />P.S.  This record IS available through mp3's on this site obviously or like nearly the entire Chicago catalog on Rhapsody and I'm sure other subscription services so don't bother tracking down an expensive used copy.  But track it down for sure!
B001ILFUDM|5.0|When I - and I assume, most people - think of Pinocchio, we think of his nose growing longer when he tells a lie. Yet, that is only one scene in this movie - the first one ever done on this famous fictional character, I believe.    This is strictly a fantasy-adventure story, not a parable or a full story about lying, although that obviously is one of the messages. There are several moral messages in here, so it's a worthwhile story for kids to see.    Sometimes I think these totally-innocent first few Disney efforts (Bambi, Fantasia) are still better than most the stuff they have put out since. It's nice to see this on a fantastic Blu-Ray disc. It's amazing what Disney is doing on Blu-Ray with spectacular detail and bold color restoration.  First, \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and now this.    Those colorful scenes are another attraction. particularly in the beginning in the old man's house with all the fancy clocks and toys. That part is better than much of the adventure story, as it turns out. The story lags a bit in the middle and then picks up with a rousing finish with a big whale.    Overall, I enjoyed \\"Jiminy Cricket\\" the best and also appreciated that they didn't overdo the songs in here: short and sweet, and not that many.  This is good stuff!
031606792X|3.0|In spite of all the scathing reviews, I gave in and read \\"Breaking Dawn\\" just to finish the series.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The book was neither as awful nor as wonderful as the polarized reviews on Amazon led me to believe.    The best thing I could say about the first three books in the Twilight series is that they provided a springboard for discussion with my daughter about thinking before making life-changing decisions.  I found Bella immature, impulsive, and manipulative--very annoying.  But she is a reasonably honest portrayal of a teenager.  I was glad she didn't stay that way.    One of my pet peeves are book series where the main character never grows, never overcomes any flaws or weaknesses.  While Bella remains a little whiney and very stubborn, in \\"Breaking Dawn\\" she outgrew her damsel-in-distress mentality without giving up everything that made her \\"Bella.\\"  She acted as I would expect a new mother to act, and there was enough foreshadowing in the previous books that I found her \\"super powers\\" believable.    Meyers' writing was good enough for me to suspend my disbelief about vampire daddies, imprinting, and hordes of evil guys showing up without anyone seeing them.  And the story has a happy ending, which is always a plus.  Perhaps the book is too long and the plot a little too neat, but then haven't you ever wished that Romeo and Juliet lived happily ever after?  I'd give the book a solid 3.5.  \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is a nice, light read.
B00000ING2|3.0|Carter Burwell's soundtrack is wonderful, the period production design is lovely, and the script shows the writers' skill with words.  Paul Newman is the most watchable one except for Charles Durning, whose role is rather small and brief.  This isn't really a comedy, though; it seems more serious than that.  The muted lighting and colors give it a gravity that a comedy doesn't normally have. Also, there isn't really anything all that funny or laughter-provoking in it, and Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh, while certainly talented, are not strong comedic performers.   Also, the way that the movie is done probably would have gone over better in the past, when people were used to the Capra and Sturges productions.   This offering just doesn't seem suited to a modern audience.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|It's a thorough delight.  Scarlett Johansson said in an interview that working on this film with Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz was even more fun because they came to the set having spent a lot of time improvising together and developing their problematic film relationship.  The result is more fun than a circus:  Bardem and Cruz are radioactive on the screen, teasing up the tension and riding it like a pair of daredevil surfers on a cresting wave.  Johansson contributes the missing ingredient to the film just as to the fictional relationship, nevertheless sliding through the thorny plot as if Teflon-coated.  Rebecca Hall and Bardem's continuing game of \\"No, I mean maybe\\" & \\"Why are you lying?\\" creates an undercurrent of unease throughout the film, and the sly male voice-over is delightful.  I see something new in this film every time I watch it.  And, the musical score is wonderful.  We all want to go to Barcelona now.
B000000W6R|4.0|I was happy with this cd, it shipped quickly despite the case being cracked (no big deal, cd was still good) and you can't beat the price.
0345495004|5.0|This book held my attention from Page 1... It was written so well, I got mad, I cryed, I laughed.  This book had all kinds of emotion.  I did not realize what a selfish man Frank was, yet he was a genious.  I must admit I was not prepared for the ending.  I was shocked to learn that this had actually happened.<br />We read this as a book club (The Boadacious Babes of Jacksonville), and the discussion was very interesting, but everyone agreed it was a very good read and worth the time spent reading it.  Everyone had a little different opinion as to what she should have done about her affair with Frank,  Like leaving her children and in some ways being verbally abused by him.  But it was very apparent they did love each other.<br />For people interested in learning more about famous people this is a \\"Must Read.\\"
B00192KCQ0|5.0|When I heard that Metallica was releasing a new album and it was going to be called Death Magnetic I was so scared. I really thought it was gonna be a complete dupicate of St. Anger, So at first I hesitated of buying this album mainly because of hearing no guitar solos and that god awful Snare Drum in St. Anger. So how did I approach myself of buying this album I borrowed my friends the day it came out and listened to it one good time. To tell everyone the truth I was not disappointed at all at this album. I absoloutely love this album, It was almost as if I just put Ride, Kill, Master, and Justice in all at once. So as soon as I gave the album back to my friend I went out to buy the album. So my suggestion to anyone and every Metallica fans out there, This album is a complete Masterpiece compared to St. Anger, So if your ready to relive your childhood with Metallica as you once did with Kill, Ride, Master, and Justice. Do yourself a favor and go pick up a copy of this album. Believe me you want be disappointed. =)
B000MV90IU|5.0|Blu-Ray Review ...<br /><br />Telephones, teletexts, thoroughbred racing cars, medical equipment, airplanes, brick buildings, and firearms. Everything a modern man needs to lose himself with.<br /><br />A very  serious tale of detachment and man caught under the industrialization that besets him on all sides. Humanity breaks apart like ash as things like avarice, materialism, greed, corruption, murder and indifference trump. This is not Steve McQueen at [[ASIN:B0009HKH6Q his finest]], but definitely at his most serious. If this film were done today, he would've been panned for being too emotionless, too stoic, too robotic. But back in the day, this is what good film making was all about. Especially cop dramas like [[ASIN:B000MV90IU Bullitt]], even though it has the same artistic integrity as [[ASIN:B001JNNDAQ The French Connection]].<br /><br />A lot of people love this movie for the car chase scene midway through San Francisco, Livermore and beyond. People often mention the mustang as well. But the layers of this film are vasty and  dimensional and go beyond an early homage to John Frankenheimer.<br /><br />The core story does read like a modernized version of one of Raymond Chandler's stories, but told through the eyes of a police officer and not a detective. The film also, unconventionally has three acts which are all very distinguishable as well. The first act centers around the assignment, the lieutenant's girl and his life and how it interferes and intersects with his career. Ahh ... a cop's struggle to maintain a certain level of normalcy. It wraps up with the botched protection job. I shouldn't worry about spoilers as this film was released in 1968 and you should've seen it by now.<br /><br />The second act follows from the car chase to a certain reveal about the story, the investigation and where it starts to go. The highlight being a dead girl's body lying on a hotel floor with legs posed like a centerfold in a pair of pantyhose. Very interesting indeed. Speaks volumes about some of the things that occurred in that area and legal history in those same years.<br /><br />The third act is obviously the conclusion. One of the more interesting moments within the conclusion is a scene where our man Steve shoots a `perp' through a set of plate glass automatic doors. It's like a statement on the separation of realities which is alluded to earlier in the film by Jaqueline Bisset about the difference of their lives. The `perp' shoots a cop through glass and then turns and gets shot himself. It reminded me of the scene in [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner]] where Joanna Cassidy gets shot in the back by Harrison Ford and then falls like a wilting flower through plate glass windows. This scene might've even been the inspiration for that with the amount of art in it.<br /><br />Steve's final scene as he's at the wash basin and sees his face in the mirror seems to point a finger at the point I previously mentioned as the first act has a few scenes with bathroom mirrors as well. His stepping toward Jaqueline Bisset also seems to give the viewer a clue as to the continued direction of his character.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is that there is strangely a certain amount of same-ness with this film and Hal Ashby's 1971 masterpiece [[ASIN:B001Q8MMGU Harold & Maude]]. What, you say? I know. The chase scene follows a lot of the same route as Maude takes on her car-jacking spree and the scene where Bissett gets out of the car is the same location in San Mateo where Bud Cort and Ruth Gorden have the same kind of conversation on life and humanity. The automotive driving scenes in Harold and Maude are also `as' artistic and maybe even a little more intimate and direct. I can imagine the late Hal Ashby being a fan of this film. It definitely raised the bar in many aspects.<br /><br />I will say that the movie looks beautifully restored in Blue-Ray and the audio is balanced and dynamic. You can tell a lot of work went into the  remastering as this movie is not short by any means and the amount of footage must've been mountainous. Seeing [[ASIN:B000MV90IU Bullitt]] in this condition brings a renewed sense of awe to the film that could've very easily been missed during previous viewings - even if you first saw this in the theatre. If you haven't seen the film in this condition, then honestly ... you probably haven't seen it.<br /><br />... ...ve been mountainous.

B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer is a really good album by the masters of progressive rock, Yes.  The album contains just three songs, but they're long songs, the longest being The Gates Of Delirium, clocking in at 21:55.  The music is classic early '70s Yes -- lots of keyboards, synthesizers, strange guitar, and Jon Anderson's high pitched vocals, not to mention epic-length songs.  The best track in my opinion is The Gates Of Delirium.  The second track, Sound Chaser, is quite bizarre and entertaining.  The album closes with the song To Be Over.  This is a strong effort by Yes that belongs in every true Yes fan's collection.  Outstanding.
B001C48EGK|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and was pleased with how timely it was and that it accurately portrayed the American Government, especially the CIA, as nothing more than the interfering, war mongering, corporate, power hungry, crum dums that they are.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book and would definitely recommend it.  Italy was fun, India was enlightening, and Indonesia was fascinating.<br /><br />It was the most enjoyable book I've read in awhile, and I'm looking forward to hearing Elizabeth Gilbert lecture in Pittsburgh on Sept. 21, 2009.<br /><br />You will enjoy every page.
0140282033|2.0|Although I enjoyed this book overall, 2 things stood out to me (SPOILERS) -    1. The priest is clearly mentally (perhaps physically) ill    2. Armande's situation is portrayed as much too black-and-white. I say this as someone who has been a caregiver for an elderly person. It trouble me to see that her choices appear to be a nursing home (and a slow death there) versus the choice she ultimately made. Although this makes for a good plot point, I wish that Harris had dealt with possible realities - hiring help so that the character could remain at home for as long as possible, perhaps other solutions. I say this because the character was not critically ill and more than likely could have had some good years remaining to her - and because so many people (both the elderly and caregiver) have to make hard choices every day. I'm not sure that the way this was presented is helpful to anyone who's caught up in the realities of those situations.    Like many other readers, I enjoyed the screenplay more than the book. Harris' novels tend toward dark, almost gothic plots, and this one is no exception. While I liked many things about the book, I wish Harris had been a bit gentler toward all of the characters. (With the exception of Josephine's husband, that is!)
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have seen it more than three times already and I love it!!!.  It's a heartfelt and romantic movie in every aspect.  All the actors were wonderful and I thank them all for entertaining me a great deal.  It can be enjoyed by the entire family. I recommend it!
B001HC7XCS|1.0|We were dissappointed in it because of the annoying subtitles and the Korean language being spoken.The seller was very nice.We returned it and received a full refund. Sincerely Raymond and Michele Chico.
B0018RBN8C|4.0|This was a big surprise.  Lots of hype, which made me think it would be another Amy Winehouse, but unlike Amy Winehouse, I feel it lived up to the hype.  Duffy is a great talent.  Great delivery and vocals.      This album is a great effort by a talented new artist.  Great songwriting and production.    If you're interested in 60s girl groups or old soul music, but want something a little different, this is a good album to get.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|Whether by direction or lack of script, these two women are terrible in this movie.  I know its camp but man, this was bad.  At least I could have laughed through it.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I myself really liked the Bob Seger music, but after reading more about the real Rocky Dennis I realized that Bruce Springstien was his favorite singer. Bruce's music was suppose to be in there from the beginning, but because of legal reasons was replaced with Bob. Rest in peace Rocky, I wish I could be half the person you where.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|It's probably all been said before.  In fact, when a movie has 909 reviews it's probably all been said more than once.  So, I just want to put my 5 Stars on the board for one of the best movies of all time.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, why are you waiting?<br /><br />Get it, watch it and watch it more than once.  This movie is like an onion, lots and lots of layers.  If you have kids, definitely watch it with them.  This movie will give you lots of opportunities for useful discussion.  Heat it up and enjoy the abundant output of an incredibly gifted team of vertically integrated artists....
B001F12J0C|5.0|Love Bourne in all his incarnations.  These are an excellent value, plus playing them on a Blueray player really class them up. It's great to be able to watch the trilogy and see the over lap.
B000UFAURI|5.0|This is a brilliant CD.  Don't pass it up.  Three songs stand out.  \\"The Pretender\\"-hard, fast and absolutely fantastic.  \\"Let It Die\\" which is clearly addressed to Kurt Cobain.  And \\"Home\\", a song which reached in and grabbed me.<br />The Foo Fighters have always had stuff I liked, but this CD has sold me on them for good.  Absolutely amazing.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I loved their unique sound and their lead vocals \\"raspy\\" voice. Very sexy!I'm always nervous about ordering an entire CD just because I've heard 1 song and liked it, but this did not disappoint me I loved the whole thing.
B000002JSJ|5.0|excellent.  Continues there dominance of the decade of the 70`s.. SOme would say of all time.  I am one of them.  The beatle and the zepsters shared one year together 69.  The beatles went defunct in 1970.  So popped up zeppelin and the torch was passed.  They became in the 70`s what the beatles where in the 60`s.  A freaking creative juggernaut.  Even the albums considered bad or not so great by zep (PRESENCE AND IN THROUGH THE OUTDOOR) are superior to many bands others.  I personally like physical graffiti the most.  Presence though is a close second.  The rest are a close 3rd.   I must say the natural progression from the beatles to zeppelin has not been replicated.  The most dominant group of the 80s was genesis and phil collins.  So much for progression.  I guess u could say metallica.  But they did not dominate the 80s.  They were underground.  And were not as experimental as the beatles and zep until 1996 load.    I say the 90s grunge movement was influenced by the heavy zepsters.  Alice n chains, nirvana and soundgarden were all heavily influenced by zep. They had some experimentation in them.  No one today carries the torch.  Glad the music lives on.  Buy presence.  Though considered one of there weaker albums, it demolishes many of there peers and even current rockers.  TTYL
0312380852|5.0|Being a latent \\"flower child\\" and (sad to admit) macramé junkie from yester-year...I was intrigued to see a book on the latest spin in the ancient art of knot tying.  The cover is gorgeous though and sucks you into the 30 projects that have fun intros, enticing names and detailed photos.  Yes, the \\"Stained Glass Bracelet\\" is as fabulous as it sounds but doesn't look too daunting to construct.  Then there's the \\"Dark Side of the Moon Necklace\\" which is really made from a couple simple knots but in such an elegant mix with beads that you could find yourself wiping one up in a weekend.  Which in fact, is what I did the with the \\"Baroque Bracelet\\" (pgs. 84-89) and the \\"Ojime Necklace\\" (pgs. 26-29).  There are also watchbands that I'm dying to try on some old timepieces I have laying around, and the book has been a terrific resource for finding out how to mount beautiful cabochons and cameos in something other than metal.  This puts a new lease on life to those intricate buttons and broken jewelry pieces  that need a new setting.  I was pleased to find the instructions and photos were easy to follow and I've now added this wonderful knowledge to my repertoire of crafty-handy skills for making great jewelry without breaking the bank.      Which is another thing I liked about this book - all the supplies are listed with directions for not only the individual projects, but how do to the knots and get started on this easy, compact way to continue what used to be a bulky, cumbersome hobby.  These jewelry projects are all ones that could be taken \\"on the go.\\"  Believe it!  These eye-candy proto-types can ALL be managed ON YOUR LAP with a padded clipboard (directions to make your own for a couple bucks are included in the book) AND without having to bring along rolls of the wire and various paraphernalia that creating wire/bead/crimping type jewelry requires.    These projects let me put a small clipboard and Ziploc bag of stuff into my computer bag with my laptop and do theseon the go - because unlike crochet, knitting or wire stringing projects - these can be stopped and put on hold with each knot!!!  How's that for being able to create \\"bling\\" and fantastic gifts on the fly or with a busy lifestyle?      Way to go Annika deGroot for giving me back my one of my favorite teen hobbies...now if you could just help me find my rose-colored sunglasses, string some beads into my hair and braid it or fit into my old hip-huggers with the WIDE flare legs!  ;o)
B000OVLINI|5.0|I unlike many people that write reviews, am not an avid reader but a passionate one. I love to immerse myself in books that make me live out and experience what the words spell out. It does not happen often but I have found new life in the emotional rollercoaster that Mr. Zafon has put me through. The author's vocabulary is beyond expectation at times. You will feel like you lived in Barcelona by the time you are done. I lived, cried, and loved with Daniel and his story and I know you will too.  I will also never forget Fermin and his antics, which will make you want a friend like him! This author demonstrates a magnificent ease to tell a story so complete with sexual desire, passion, sadness and the ultimate resolution and satisfaction of resolve, that you will crave more. I know I have.
B000BNI90O|2.0|I heard an excerpt of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship... on the radio & rushed home to order. The set is much darker than the excerpt I heard, so a little disappointed there. While listening in the car, there are some areas that are very soft and hard to hear, while others just blast out the windows. I enjoy the complexity of the music overall, but probably wouldn't buy another set like this.
0446698326|5.0|I was quite impressed with the condition of the book.  I really enjoy Nicholas Sparks' books, and look forward to reading more of his works.
1582701709|3.0|I beg to differ with the authors of this book.  There is something called random bad luck, and it happens.  Poop happens, so deal with it.  The men and women who were raped and murdered in Nazi concentration camps did not attract their fate because they were thinking the wrong thoughts.  If you are thrown from a horse and break your neck, or choke to death on a chicken bone, it`s not because you attracted this into your life.  The Universe is not going to give you everything you want just because you want it.  My advice is to focus on what you want, but remain detached from the result.  You have control over your thinking, but you cannot control the results.  Think good thoughts, but don't try to control future events by using the power of thought.  The part I found most ridiculous was David Schirmer talking about how he visualized checks coming in the mail rather than bills, and within one month, according to his testimony, things changed.  He makes it sound like people can sit home and amass fortunes by visualizing.  Why work if I can attract checks worth millions of dollars?  Child, please.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|[[ASIN:B000AM6OQ2 The Fog (Special Edition)]]       Some viewers are hard to please. They don't appreciate a movie like this that has more horror in it than most creepshows combined. It's a matter of what is important to notice and what isn't. The fog and the ghost ship manifest between 12 am and 1 am. The reason Nick and Elizabeth didn't get killed was because 1:00 am came and all that happened was the shattering of the glass in the clock. There are unanswered questions. Did the ghosts kill everyone in the town before breaking into the church? Did they kill the ones who appeared to survive when the fog left after Father Malone returned the gold? There were 6 conspirators who caused the death of Blake and the other members of the leper colony. Who were the descendants besides Father Malone? Was he a Roman Catholic Priest? And if so, how could he be the grandson of a Roman Catholic Priest? Elizabeth (Jamie Lee Curtis) comes from out of nowhere as a hitchhiker at the start of the movie. The name \\"Elizabeth\\" is also the name of the ship that sunk with the avenging crew on it. What was she doing in Antonio Bay on that day? Was it a coincidence? Father Malone, 100 years ago, who took part in the murder plot, writes in his journal \\"If it were possible for me to raise the dead.....\\" and apparently it was. The disturbances in town like the lights and phones and car horns going on and off were a form of telekinesis brought on by the emergence of bad energies being reawakened after 100 years. The town was formed on the gold and blood of the sad leper colony. Is this story trying to tell us that there are towns, cities, communities, schools, political powers and industries that were built on the blood and theft of a group of unknown murdered people? And if so, what lies ahead.....revenge by unseen forces more invisible than the ghosts in the fog? Food for thought.
0810979772|5.0|My boys (age 9) love the Diary of a Whimpy Kid book series and often read them in one day of receiving them.  My kids also love to draw and make up imaginary characters and when I saw this \\"activity\\" book at Amazon's great price I had to buy two of them.  The book is funny and the boys get a chance to create their own sayings, characters. and answer questions which is not only fun for them, but as a parent I love to see what they create and write.  This is a nice change of pace to get them to read, be creative, and stay away from the video game system.

0375842209|5.0|Liesel, a young German girl, is traumatized by the loss of her parents, the death of her brother, and the war-stricken world in which she lives. Liesel is placed into the home of The Hubermanns' after her mother leaves her to the foster care system. The horrific events Liesel endures haunt her constantly, but the nightmares enable her to form a loving relationship with her foster father, Hans Hubermann. Liesel and Hans' relationship quickly grows to resemble that of a biological father and daughter. Both Leisel and Hans learn from each other, confide in each other, and rely on each other until the very end. Hans provides Liesel with the greatest gift she could ever receive, the gift of being able to read and write. Literacy empowers Liesel to speak up for herself, for her friends, and for the Jewish man hiding in her basement. While death looms over her neighborhood with every shriek of the bombing warning siren, Liesel comforts her neighbors by reading aloud in the bomb shelter as they wait for the sirens to stop. Liesel's life leaves her with very few opportunities for happiness, but she still manages to have glimpses of it by stealing the one thing that has not let her down: books.   This riveting story is written from a German, Non-Jewish perspective which brings an interesting twist to the standard Holocaust novel. Death is the narrator of Liesel's story, and while this may seem odd, seeing that the story takes place during World War II makes this choice blatantly obvious. However, Death's character is not the stereotypical Grim Reaper-type, but rather he is compassionate, witty, and surprisingly tender. Zusak's writing style is poetic, illustrative, and mesmerizing. His use of symbolism and metaphors throughout the novel is both unique and insightful and it instantly captures the reader's attention. While the novel is set in Germany during World War II, the focus of the story is not solely on the Holocaust but on the notion that not all Germans are Nazis and not all Nazis are murderers. The Book Thief is a meaningful, thought provoking, and emotional novel that leaves the reader speechless, stunned, and amazed at Zusak's ability to tell this horrific story with such compassion and grace. This novel is a must-read, and it will not be a disappointment to readers young and old-alike.
0156030470|5.0|One of my favorite novels.  It's dense and provocative and profound.  So many passages say so much so well that I found myself constantly re-reading passages to get the meaning.  At times Woolf lays it on a bit thick and it felt like reading through molasses.  I kept longing for a letup that never came, like driving a winding road where you wait for a straightaway so you can recover. Demanding but worth the effort; disturbing and unsettling too.  Not the best bedtime read.    Overall, a beautifully-written and an intense search for meaning.  Becomes even more poignant when you consider the tragic fate of Woolf herself.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I really love concept albums and this one is no exception. Very reminiscent of some of the earlier Priest.
B001OD6HN6|2.0|I have the previous album of Lily's and loved it!! It was so cheerful and upbeat. I bought this one hoping for the same thing. I was DEEPLY disappointed!! Although the music is upbeat and catchy the lyrics are HORRIBLE!!! I don't want to listen to a song that's talking about how your boyfriend doesn't make you scream in bed and how you spend hours giving head!!! PLEASE! I also didn't think the song [...] you\\" was in good taste AT ALL! How could you even title your song that!? Even though this version is clean you can't bleap out every word.  I don't want to know if Lily thinks George W Bush is evil and get politics mixed into it. I just want to listen to some good music by someone who is talented. When Lily goes off on her soap box she just ends up sounding immature and ignorant. I probably won't listen to her anymore [...]

B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. is such a great movie.  Everyone knows this.  I first saw it when I was really little, so I didn't truly appreciate how awesome it is.  There are funny parts, and sad parts: overall a great family film.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Excellent service.  This is an outstanding video.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  I have ordered several times from Amazon.com and have not been disappointed any of those times.  I had the dvd within 3 days of placing my order.  The condition was new as indicated.  I would not hesitate to order from you again
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Just a couple of notes:  I did not see this film in 1968 (though I could have).  I saw it recently.  A couple of things made me smile:  the scenes in Monument Valley which made it the only Leone Western that was filmed (if only in part) in the West.  AND, unlike John Ford who almost owned Monument Valley in films, Leone actually made the locale of his film Arizona.  Monument Valley is partially in Utah and partially in Arizona.  John Ford always wanted us to believe it was in Texas (over and over again).  Having lived in Texas for 9 years, I have found the state to be topographically challenged.  There is nothing as awesome as Monument Valley or 5 other National Parks in Southern Utah.<br /><br />And.... something European directors of Westerns never seemed to get right:  there's no sagebrush in their European settings !<br /><br />As to the movie -- very interesting.  The cinematography and pace keep it out of the normal Action & Adventure category.  There's practically no dialogue for the first 10 minutes.  But the camera shots are infinitely interesting.  I liked the whole thing much better than I thought I would and wish I had seen it in the movie palaces of the '60's -- on a really big screen.
0439813786|5.0|I came across this book in the library and was captivated by the amazing drawings and intriguing story.  I purchased a copy for my 10 year old.  He is a bit of an artist himself and he preferred art to reading.  This book sucked him in and we talked about it for days after we (both) finished it.  He is very interested in reading more books now! Highly recommended.
0525951113|5.0|An awesome read. Suarez's DAEMON is a pulse-pounding thriller with a plot on the cutting edge of technology. Plausible enough to hook the reader from the get go, this novel blends fascinating characters with a storyline that is entirely original and unpredictable. Having said that, DAEMON is not for everyone. Being at least a little computer savvy may be a minimum requirement to appreciate DAEMON and buy into it's extreme tech vision. For computer gamers and also for those who know where the internet and artificial intelligence are headed, this book is a must read.
B000000W5P|4.0|I received this order in very good condition and time.    The sound is quite original and I'm tempted to play it every now and then. Many thanks to my seller.
B001QWEE4E|5.0|Blu-ray makes the characters of Innis Del Mar and Jack Twist actually \\"appear\\" to be in your living room!  This film now has a 3rd dimensional quality heretofore not known to me. It is superb in all categories:  acting, musical score and direction.  A five star masterpiece that will live on forever.  If you already have seen it or own it on regular DVD...do yourself a \\"big favor\\" and purchase it in Blu-ray.  You won't be sorry! You really haven't seen this picture until you watch it in the Blu-ray format!
B000000W5F|4.0|I received this order in good condition and time. The CD sound is as original.    No worries.
1401207138|5.0|Ok, if you saw the movie you so have to read this book.  You'll get the basic jist of the storyline, but trust me its really worth it.
0529064847|5.0|Exactly what we needed for a Bible study group but could not find it in stores.  Received promptly at a reasonble price.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I have seen both versions but have not read the book...next on my list.  I do like this version better in most respects but agree that the running in the end is something to take, even if it were in todays time.  Could have been done better and still gotten the point across.  I do like this version more in all the other areas.  Her sisters (and her father) are less annoying but still convincing.  Captain Wentworth (Who is EXTREMELY good looking)is much more convincing and I could actually tell of the love between them even after all these years (is that not why we watch) than in the other one.  Now as I go to read the book...I may be back to update the review..  :)
B000002B1M|5.0|This c.d. was the first c.d. i ever purchased.  I saw Nas video \\"If i ruled the world\\", and thought this man is so fine, i have to have the c.d.  I was very surprised at how good the c.d. was.  Every so on the c.d. was great.  I was hooked from the intro.  Everybody says that illmatic was nas best c.d., but I think I was written was.  It made me fall in love with nas as a rapper.  And after purchasing this c.d., I ended up buy more of nas c.d.s in the future.  He's a great rapper and this is a great c.d.  Highly recommened.
B00007G207|5.0|I love this movie and have seen it more times than I can count.  It is simply, a perfect film.  I cry without fail (good warm tears) at the final scene.      Whoever said this film is pornographic must have the dullest mind and the lowest IQ on the planet.  That is a really bizzare comment and the film has not even a hint of anything like that, the reviewer must have been blind, deaf, mentally ill and have an IQ between a rock and cut wood.    Get this film and watch it with your girl friend.  Or someone you love.... you won't regret it.  For a less emotional good film, My Dinner with Andre is excellent a well..so too with A Bronx Tale to make a nice trio.
B001194F5K|5.0|This was an incredible story that made me realize how blessed I have been to have led a comparatively sheltered life.  Once started I could not put the book down.
B00005OBSD|5.0|Free was by any stretch of the imagination, a legendary rock band. Blues prodigies by the ripe old average age of seventeen and a half, Paul Rodgers, Paul Kossoff, Andy Fraser and Simon Kirke should be in the Rock n' Roll hall of Fame. Alas, the idiots that select that crap haven't considered their contributions as meaningful enough. Should you care? Listen to their debut, `Tons of Sobs' which was released in the late winter of 1969, though it should have come out about three months earlier. The album is powerful and raw, much heavier by contrast to their later more well known releases such as `Fire and Water'.  \\"Walk in My Shadow\\" is pulverizing in its intensity and anger and \\"Worry\\" is justifiably titled. Kossoff is amazing on this record and why he isn't as well known today is a crime. \\"I'm A Mover\\" and \\"The Hunter\\" are the most well known songs from the record but will never get any American radio airplay! \\"Wild Indian Woman\\" is very sexual and you can hear the lust in Rodgers' voice.  It is very hard to remind yourself that these were kids, \\"The Heavy Metal Kids\\" if Chirs Blackwell, Island's label boss, had his way. \\"Goin' Down Slow\\" and \\"Moonshine\\" would be the slow blues highlights of this remarkable record. `Sobs' was not a big commercial success but put Free on the map of British blues and on to bigger and richer pastures. You may be pleasantly surprised at the ferocity of this LP but Free were for real, as young and punchy as they were.
B001PE26QQ|1.0|the movie is really a great movie. Acting is good and so fast I will highly say it's a great movie. But the dvd itself isn't the orginal it's just only a copy. When the blu ray price come down a little bit. I will get a real blu ray dvd for my collection!!!!
B000Q67876|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies; it's fantastic.  The Blu-Ray Book version comes in the form of a book the size of a Blu-Ray or DVD case with pictures and comments about the film, and has the Blu-Ray disc itself in the back of the book.  The disc also has several special features including interviews with the actors, writers, and directors.  It's well worth the money.
1416550542|5.0|I read The House at Riverton last year, really enjoyed it, so when I saw this book on Amazon, I just had to have it.  It was well-written and the story was great.  I look forward to reading more books by Ms. Morton.
0393324818|5.0|I would disagree with some other reviewers... this is a fantastic baseball book, now a few years old (they discuss the 2002 MLB season in detail) but still very, very pertinent to the current baseball climate, and explains a LOT, not only with the way the game is played on the field, but off as well.  It is a good business book as well.  without laying it on too thick.   However, one really needs to have more than a passing interest in baseball.  It helps to already know what on-base and slugging stats means from the beginning of the book, for example.  There is a lot of discussion of the minor league life, which tends not to appeal to people just looking for a business book and just go to games occasionally.  So, this is a terrific book, but one needs to have some interest in the subject matter first.
076790382X|2.0|This is a collection of short articles in which the author whines about anything and everything. We all know one of those people. They can complain about anything - too hot, too cold, too rainy, too sunny. At one point, he even complained about other people driving with their windows up! How can that bother someone? Several times, I found myself almost in disbelief that he could complain (or even care) about these things.    I would have probably given this book 1 star for the negativity, but he is funny at times, and he had the mercy of making each chapter only a few pages, so the reader only needs to take it in small doses.    Ok: I'm done whining about his whining.
0316166685|4.0|I bought this book used from Amazon and it arrived in great condition and as promised.
006112429X|4.0|The two main characters in this book are very disturbing. Shriver has written them both very well. And we, the readers, are the \\"watchers\\" getting something by reading about the \\"watchees,\\" the ones involved in this (fictionalized) heinous crime. I had difficulty with the initial chapters of the book. The style of reading one character's thoughts page after page was a bit slow. But Shriver planted ideas early on that kept me reading because I wanted to know how they resolved. And the writing got better as I got deeper into the book; or I just got used to the style. This is a book that makes you think, which I like. But it's disturbing.  I'd like to see a Version 2 of this book, with the mother character seeking psychological assistance early on during her pregnancy and then also later when the attachment process to her baby is not forthcoming. There is help available for people (characters) like this, and I get tired of authors not exploring these more healthy choices. Then again, I live in the vicinity of Kip Kinkel, whose parents did seek psychological care for their son and ended up murdered by him (probably not because they sought help but more likely because of his psychological disorders). This is a book that is very well done and worth the price.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Since I am a child of the 80's I usually don't like today's music.  Since I love everything Twilight something was telling me to get the soundtrack even though it had been 4 months since I saw the movie and didn't quite remember what songs were in the film.  I am so glad I did!!! I simply love the soundtrack!!!  I play it all the time... wish there was a Twilight part 2.
B000AP04L0|4.0|I finally got around to ordering this movie. It's been years since I first watched it. It was every bit as good as I remember. It is a realistic (although exaggerated) view of the modern day workplace. The exaggerations lend to the humor of the movie. Great acting and solid story.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|This was the first \\"buddy\\" film to follow up on the door opened by Bogie and Claude Rains at the end of \\"Casablanca\\".    What a brilliant script... what brilliant acting... what brilliant directing!    The dialog is perfect but what really makes this film a classic is the interaction between Newman and Redford.
0930289234|5.0|Still have not seen the movie, but I would recommend the comic book to anyone who has an interest in the genre. Alan Moore is a genius and this is just one more example of it
0374531269|5.0|It's always difficult to critique someone's memoirs especially when it's non-comedic. It is their re-telling of their lives, their interpretation of events they experienced. How can you review the lenses through which someone is looking at themselves? I think the best I can do is review how the narration affected me.  I first came across Ishamel Beah when he made a book tour stop on Book TV and he came off as a sincere young man with the most innocent smile. I wondered at how much of a survivor he must be - to have undergone and participated in the worst of horrors and still be able to let go of bitterness and smile so cleanly out of his heart. That made an impression on me and I filed ' A Long Way Gone' for reading sometime in the future.   A year later and I am writing a class paper on Sierra Leone's decade-long diamond war and I remembered Ishmael and his book and thought it would give me a great first hand account perspective. It did. So much so I had to stop reading every now and then to give myself emotional and mental breaks, to stop myself from retching, to breathe, to come back into the real world and be reminded that goodness and light still do exist.    I like that he avoids glorifying violence, that he is not a gratuitous writer. I also like that he does not fall into the trap of poor stylistic writing like many other memoir authors who take for granted that since they are telling the truth, literary style should not matter. A story is only ever good if it is told well regardless of if it is factual or fictional.    In the course of researching my paper, I came across claims that disputed the veracity of Beah's claims of being a boy soldier. While I do not condone any type of literary dishonesty, I do think it wise to have hard evidence that disproves Beah. They could for instance investigate UNICEF records, interview his extended family in Freetown and so forth.  I personally believed Beah's story. I found no reason not to. It is pretty standard to exaggerate or embellish facts. We all do that in everyday life and it is an accepted literary device. Also, considering the trauma and the time frame between experiencing those events and writing the book, is it not possible he could have unintentionally gotten his dates and timeline of events mixed up?    I could go on and on but I think the point of the book was to bring attention to the tragic use of child soldiers in warfare, the lack of sufficient psychological counseling for former child soldiers, the bleak future of a generation of Sierra Leone's limbless youth and raising money for his foundation which tackles these issues. I think that was/is his point and should be ours too.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|[...]  At best, it's a documentary on the sorry state of government-run alleged \\"schools\\" that so many can be fooled by a greedy gasbag politician who himself uses 20 times the average amount of energy as the homes of the Normal-American Community.    It may be too late already, but WAKE UP, America!  Sheesh, it's just embarrassing.
0930289234|4.0|I had never heard of the Watchmen prior to the movie hype. In fact, I haven't read a comic book in years. Curious about the movie, I ordered the graphic novel to read. I found it to be very well done and fairly deep for a comic book. Quite enjoyable to read. While the movie was very good, I really enjoyed the graphic novel.
B000096IBI|5.0|Not sure why I'd bother to write a review of a movie made in 1936 but I recently viewed the DVD and was just blown away by what a complete film this is on so many levels. Chaplin's genius is on full display throughout. An amazing crossroads moment as Chaplin maintains the silent film aesthetic with some concessions to the new \\"talkies\\" technology.<br />The story succeeds as a social satire, as a love story and as a comedy all in one. No mean feat. Chaplin's costar and \\"wife\\" Paulette Goddard is stunning and he frames every scene she is in with a close up that shows her face to be one that the camera loves. Chaplin sings a nonsensical song in French which is a classic scene and there are many others.<br />If you have any hesitation about watching older silent movies this is a great place to start because despite the age of this film there is enough here to delight any movie lover.
0385340990|4.0|This was an enjoyable quick read, perfect for traveling or on the beach. I found the lead character a little unbelievable, but that is a minor complaint. It was interesting to find out that Guernsey was occupied by Germans during the war.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I noticed in one of the reviews that a purchaser complained about the audience participation. Well... of course you want to here the artist sing, that's why you buy their merch. All I can say is that it was between some songs or to get a groove going when he wanted participation. Some songs he asked them to sing a song he's done for more than a decade (and I'm sure he's probably tired of singing) where everyone knows at least the first verse, he then takes over. It seemed it was a way to get the audience loose and have fun; Get a party vibe going. And it worked. I almost didn't purchase this for the reason the reviewer voiced but I am glad I followed my first mind.     I also noticed he did give a (very minor) reference to GOD but didn't go overboard like many artists after they have decided for them religion is the way to go. There was a minor reference to let you know where he stands and it was constructed in a way that it was plain, or at least for me, that he wanted things to be viewed as a suggestion of love not religion. Can't we all get along type of vibe without preaching.    The band as usual was tight and in the groove although the background vocals were turned down on the low side at times leaving the impression stevie was singing alone. His beautiful daughter Aisha, the one of whom he sings about on Isn't she lovely, was among the singers. She has a solo that showcases her pretty voice with all it's \\"no surprise she can sing, look at her dad\\" although, it was entertaining, there was nothing spectacular in her performance.    My surprises were the opening of a brief Miles Davis blues groove followed with a flood of dance jams right off the top of the concert. The way it was arranged it flowed beautifully and surprisingly with an ever so slight jazz feel. His input of the jazz filled \\"Spain\\". The soulful groove of a voice box while welcoming and wooing the london audience were also welcomed surprises. Making references of the Beatles, Lennon, Rolling Stones and the London Bridge(falling down) sounds pretty boring in writing but his medley done with the voice box sounded more funky than I've heard Stevie in a long time.     A very much needed LIVE DVD in this music industry of today. It displays what the newer artists need to study. Showmanship with vocals, instrumentation, arrangments, musicianship and dare I say...yes talent.    If you were a Stevie Wonder fan from before \\"Music of my mind\\" or one after \\"In Square Circle\\". This concert will not dissapoint. Kudos Stevie & Wonderlove. Thank you for giving everyone, who wants to, a chance to view you Live at Last.
B001GM28HO|3.0|I enjoy dance music and electronic music, so I wouldn't mark an album down for being electronic or dance oriented.  There is something initially alluring about Lady GaGa:  the over-the-top theatrics, the whacky costumes, and the over-calculated image. Yet... Listening and watching Lady GaGa is a lot like eating a 10 lb bag of candy; you feel great initially and then once you get off the sugar high, you feel like crap and realize that what you had wont benefit you in any way and will only help you gain wait and cause you to be strung out.  Don't get me wrong, these songs are enjoyable, just like candy, but because of the mask that Lady GaGa (literally and figuraratively) hides behind, you'll realize there is nothing substantle after a few listens listens.<br /><br />  There is an aweful lot of talk about sex in most of the songs \\"Love Game\\", \\"Summer Boy\\", \\"Boys, Boys, Bors\\", \\"Starstruck\\", money \\"Money Honey\\", \\"Beautiful Dirty Rich\\", and even puppy love \\"Eh, Eh\\" and \\"Paparazzi\\".  There is nothing substantial to connect to, everything after a few listens feels very diconnected from reality.  Its a lot like watching a Broadway Musical, only you'll get more out of most broadway musicals then you will out of this.<br /><br />  Th overall feeling of the album is very overproduced, although from live performance it is clear Lady GaGa has a pretty good voice (better than some, but worse than others), it is hidden behind a lot of studio gimickry and dramatics.  The only tracks that are still awesome after 10 listens are \\"Pokerface\\" and \\"Just Dance\\" which are glossy dance pop at its very best.  The other attempts at such catchy pop tunes like \\"Love Game\\" are not quite as sucessful, especially with some of the god awful lyrics; even though some of the lyrics in \\"Poker face\\":<br /><br />  'I wont telll you that I love you, kiss you or hug you, cause of bluffin with my muffin, I'm not lyin, I'm just stunnin with my love glue gunnin.'<br /><br />Many of the lyrics in these songs seem like veiled attempts at shocking people or the like.<br /><br />  I come from a theatrical background, and what initially attracked me to Lady GaGa were her theatrics, it fools you into believing she is something new or fresh.  I will not deny that she is very talented, she obviously has some gifts when it comes to showmanship, but only time will tell how long people will be able to stand her if she never grows are changes as an artist and really adds her personality into the music.<br /><br />  When I was a teenager, I thought it meant something special if something wrote their music, now I realize it really doesn't matter.  If someone sings well let them do what they do best and since, why should they have to write music if they suck at it?  If someone is mediocre at singing and can write great music, let them stay a writer.  In fact, I don't hear people criticizing writers for not singing their stuff more often; double standard much?  Some people are good at writing and singing, some people are just good at one, only time will tell if Lady GaGa is good at either of these.  At this point in time, it is impossible to tell with all the smoke and lights.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyled attempts at shocking people or the like.

1416511946|3.0|It was a very interesting story.  Got a little repetative in spots, but not so bad that I got bored with it.  I guess that's just how life is.  I absolutely loved the ending!!  The only reason I rated this book a little lower is because it was a bit hard to read in some places where the red text was on a black page.  I had to either use a magnifying glass or I skipped over it.  That was a bit annoying.  Other than that, I really did enjoy reading this book.
B001LOU8ME|5.0|Saying that a live performance by Michael Schenker is not as good as Strangers in the Night is like saying that Leonardo Da Vinci's 'other works' are not as good as the Mona Lisa. Big Deal!     One Night at Budokan remains a five-star stellar performance by a world-class guitarist and band (even if the recording level is still a touch too low).
0143142356|1.0|I sent the audiobook \\"World Without End\\" by Ken Follet to someone as a gift. The recipient decided to return it and exchange it for something else he wanted.  Instead of crediting the recipient for the return you credited me (the giver) for the return.  This embarrassed the recipient and caused me to have to jump in and give him yet another gift and smoothe over the situation.  I was happy to discover that I could email a gift card.  This is very convenient and supplied a gift that allows the recipient more choice.  You need to revamp your return practices to avoid this situation in the future. By the way, rating the product I originally gave is irrelevant.  The product quality itself was never in question.

A consciously re-imagined set of stories where there is no damsel in distress - poetic, beautiful, and everything you wish those stories you grew up on showed you long ago.
6300214753|5.0|How anyone could not like this movie is beyond me.  I hate to wax nostalgic, but it's very hard for me to believe it's been 23 years since this movie's release.  While I cringe at those 80's clothes and hairdos, I'm fully aware that the comedy here remains timeless and the angst of the wasteland known as high school remains equally pertinent.<br /><br />Although Matthew Broderick is more renowned these days for being Sarah Jessica Parker's husband and for his role in the Broadway version of Mel Brook's \\"The Producers,\\" I'll forever fondly remember him for his work as the cunning, school-cutting, school clown Bueller.  It sucks to typecast an actor, but it's pretty hard to beat his performance here.<br /><br />This movie is loaded with so many goodie quotes that an entire review can be composed solely on that subject.  It also features a few people who got noticed here and got bigger roles: Jennifer Grey one year before \\"Dirty Dancing\\" and Jeffrey Jones, as Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney, two years prior to \\"Beetlejuice,\\" to name but two of this great cast.  For me, it's always pleasantly shocking to see previously unknown actors and actresses in older movies and wonder how you could have glanced over them in the first place (even though you can never tell who's going to be famous).<br /><br />I can't help but watch this from beginning to end every time - and I don't mind a single second spent watching this - even if it's the one-thousandth and first time I've watched it.  To be cliche, it gets better and better each time.<br /><br />From Rooney getting his to Bueller's charmingly fooling everyone (except the sister) with his fake illness to the parking attendants riding Cameron's father's Ferrari at 100-plus mph and jacking up the miles to the stuffy atmosphere of the fancy downtown Chicago restaurant Bueller smooth talks his way into to the famous scene where the impromptu rendition of The Beatles' version of \\"Twist and Shout\\" livens up the downtown parade (complete with the zombie walk from Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" video from a segment of the crowd), \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" just screams classic from beginning to end.

B001U6YI92|2.0|Just got e-mail reply from Fox distrubutor here in Finland, that the U.S release will have the same video/audio stream that the finnish release. Now, if that is true, it is a bad, bad, release. The picture quality is not BD quality, much like SE dvd-release(Ps. I you have one, stick with it). The 2-disc Special Edition dvd release has better audio and the same picture quality, than the BD-release. Well, as soon as I get my U.S release, and compare them, I'll info more.
1416562605|5.0|This is an exceptional, great book. Honestly its one of the most intriguing, engrossing stories I've read in quite some time. I really liked how it delved into what life is like for 99.9% of the population in India which is very much still under the caste system - especially for those who hail from \\"the Darkness.\\"<br /><br />The political statements in the end were thought-provoking and I usually don't like personal politics mixed with my reading (see my review of \\"American Lion\\"). It's really the Hindu point of view that I found so engrossing. It's not one I've heard from much thought that's begun to change both with this book and \\"Slumdog Millionnaire.\\" BTW - this book is much more realistic and representative of Indian/Hindu society than that movie was so I've heard.<br /><br />I read every night to help me fall asleep. I found that I was unable to fall asleep reading this book, I just kept turning the pages. The end is a bit of a shocker and well worth it.

B001R5GCPY|5.0|As a long time FZ fan and owner of most of his work on vinyl this is one of my all time favorite FZ records. I have a first pressing of this on Bizarre Records which is just wonderful, both musically and sonically. I don't buy that many reissues from Classic, but since this was Zappa and approved by his wife Gail I ordered a copy. I was not disappointed! While the original 1969 Lp is very, very good, this reissue gives one just a bit more air and detail that you won't find on the original. IF you have an early pressing on Bizarre you could be very happy with it. However if, like me, you are a real fanatic and have a system that can show you the difference get this reissue. It won't disappoint you. This time Classic has done a very nice job. Also, these are the original tracks and timings not the ones from the Cd reissue.

0783225547|5.0|I teach sixth grade Earth Science and show this film to my classes every year after completing the chapter on volcanoes. It is an excellent representation of volcanology. The director is a trained geologist and was meticulous with the information and the visual effects of volcanic eruptions. It also has an entertaining story line that keeps the students' attention (except for maybe during the few romantic scenes).     I have enjoyed it myself, even watching it so frequently...it's just a wonderful film.
0393061310|5.0|Guns, Germs & Steel - Groundbreaking & Significant    In our modern world, most of the subjects Jared Diamond covers in this book should be common knowledge - but they're not. Here in the U.S., schools are still teaching watered-down versions (at best) and fiction (at worst) as historical fact.    Gun, Germs and Steel puts the real history of the world into a manageable presentation, and is honest about being imperfect and generalizing facts in order to sweep through broad subjects. Its explanations are based on factual discoveries that have been verified by scientific communities many times over.     The subject matter is so vast and informative that it literally changed the way I look at and think about people in the world we live in. My only regret is that the author just barely begins to call out the frauds of how religion and government are intertwined in their assumptions of state power. Most commendable is Diamond's attention to many examples of the frauds of racism and the distracting rationalizations for humanity's most natural and favorite past time: war.

055358894X|4.0|This book started out a little slow (it took me a few chapters to get into the world), but once everything gets going.... wow. Lynch doesn't mess around. I find it amusing that George R.R. Martin's praises are on the cover of this book, because Lynch shares his propensity for offing thoroughly likable characters.    This is one of the most satisfying books I have read, unlike many fantasy novels, this comes to a fast and speedy conclusion. The end of the book doesn't come too late or too soon, and finishes it's own story while leaving plenty of room for a long and wonderful series.    Great action, unexpected twists, unreal plotlines (Isn't that what the Fantasy Genre is for?), great character flaws. What more can you ask for? Also, the Robin Hood and Little John similarities are a delight, with a few subtle nods to The Princess Bride. Also, anything that doesn't follow the Tolkeinian template is a welcome addition to any fantasy reader's shelf.    I'm nervous about this book so quickly being snapped up and made into a movie... Hollywood can do horrors to this sort of book. But read it now before it gets made into a terrible movie and becomes cliche. My only problem upon finishing it is deciding to whom to lend it first.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is not for the faint of heart. Part heart-wrenching story of predestined love: So it is written, so it shall be; part gruesomely enlightening history lesson on the lives of the inhabitants of the slums of India, the movie draws you into the lives of its mesmerizing characters and does not release its hold on you. Not when the movie ends. Not for a long, long time. This movie stays with you, maybe longer than you want it to...  That, to me, is the mark of a great movie.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I must admit, I feared viewing this film. But upon seeing Mel Gibson's masterpiece, I feel as if \\"I have been there\\" as a witness to the horrific brutality, yet the incredible love poured out by Jesus of Nazareth, and my fear has gone. There are some poignant scenes involving Mary, His mother, and Simon, who bore the cross, that witness to a courage and strength that resides in all of us. To Mel, \\"Thank you, message understood, and well done.\\"
0930289234|5.0|This is considered to be the greatest graphic novel of all time, and there is good reason for that distinction. The story is unique, the characters are deep, and the artwork is beautiful. The story is a complex one of imperfect heroes living in an alternate 1980's world on the brink of nuclear war. I could not stop reading.<br />If you have seen the movie and not read the book yet, you certainly should read this. The movie was a fair adaptation, but reading this will give significantly more backstory and make many aspects of the film make more sense.<br />It's a classic story that everyone should read.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|for those of us who still buy cds, this is a terrific buy! nickelback has a mature hard sound that i've always loved since i first heard them. i love this cd with its raw hardcore lyrics and deep guitar. makes you wanna roll down the window, blast it loud, and sing it while you drive. which i do!
0930289528|4.0|I consider the Wachowsik Brothers movie adaptation to be one of my favorite films, so I figured it was only fair to buy the graphic novel. This was one of Alan Moore's earlier works, and the inexperience shows a little, but it's still a great story. I didn't realize how much the Wachowski Brothers had changed the story for the movie. I think they made improvements, as the story feels a bit weak. The book is also fairly short, containing a lot of dark artwork. The art is good, for the most part, but some images are confusing. Despite these gripes, it's still an amazing story. Fans of the movie will be surprised, but I still recommend it.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|this one blew me away! aside from Clive being smokin hot, i truly loved this and watch it over and over. it isn't much on the story line. it's short and to the point. you fully understand what's going on throughout the whole film for sure. the action is all shooting and escaping and will truly take your breath away. the sex scene was hilarious. he doesn't want to care...but gets trapped into it every time. look out jason statham you got competition on the hot scale!
0345451325|5.0|I wasn't expecting too much going into this, as licensed science fiction hasn't been great in my experience. Erik Nylund really surprises here, as this story is not just a great story for Halo fans, but is great science fiction. The story goes from the creation of the Spartan project to the very beginning of the first Halo game. The story explains a lot about the Halo series, and is great backstory. The battle sequences are well written, and the story moves briskly. The whole thing is a fun, exciting read that I recommend to any sci-fi fan.
B001F7MSG6|4.0|this is your typical fantasy type movie. i liked it cause who doesn't love hellboy..but it was short. much like the first one you miss the creature battles and expect to see a bit more of their world. you gotta love his humor which is not nearly played up enough. he was so cute as a kid. you want to see more of him growing up! *SPOILER* since he learns liz is preggy, i'd love to see his babies in another one! that would be awesome. definitely worth at least one watch to form your own opinion. but i swear if things don't work out with my hubby, Hellboy can sure call me!

0425166805|4.0|Some people may find this book not having good scientific explanations with questionable conclusions. But in my opinion, this book was not intended to have any scientific explanations and if read carefully, they do not really confirm or reject certain ideas. It just questions current day common belief and questions their validity. Many thoughts that we consider true based on historical teachings may not be true due to many other archeological findings and it is up to the reader to draw upon his/her own conclusions.

0312383320|4.0|When I open a Stephanie Plum book, I am always transported to her world of crazy antics and laugh out loud moments. I haven't been finding the laugh out loud moments in some of the past books but they were back with this one. I see people complaining about her world never changing and I don't understand. I count on it never changing. I want to read about her and Lula eating everything in sight and dinner at her parent's house usually being a disaster. Grandma played a very small role in this book as did Joe and Ranger. Instead the action was focused on Stephanie, Diesel, the always funny Lula, and Carl the monkey.<br /><br />Instead of telling what this book is about I just want to say it is typical Stephanie Plum. She's still chasing the bad guys, Lula is still trying to shoot people between eating chicken and donuts, and Carl the monkey is playing video games and giving the finger to one and all. Stephanie and Diesel are chasing a seriously bad guy and things look dire a couple of times for Stephanie. I loved it.

0743487486|5.0|This book is an absolute must-read on parenting.  I was fortunate enough to come across this book when my oldest was a baby.  I didn't know how it would work, but I was committed to the book's principles which really resonated with me.  My son is now 4.5 years old, and I can tell you that this is a wonderful, loving, close, gentle, respectful way to parent, that pays more and more dividends as time progresses.  I've watched my son blossom from a very intense and high-need baby/toddler to a very intense, active, loving, generous, kind boy.  Did Unconditional Parenting change his basic independent, challenging, engaging personality?  Of course not.  Nor would I want it to.  It took millions of years of evolution to give us all the wonderfully diverse personality types we see today.  But he wasn't an \\"easy\\" baby, and he's not an \\"easy\\" child.  But I see him mirroring his treatment of me and others by my treatment of him.  He has a high respect for himself and others.  He's happy,healthy, and thriving with the help of unconditional parenting (and attachment parenting).      Update: (7-9-2011)  Well, I've definitely had some parenting ups and downs since my last review.  Have had some challenging periods.  Got sucked into some more traditional discipline techniques, and had that spiral downward.   I desperately began searching for specific advice, and found \\"Parent Effectiveness Training.\\"  That changed everything.  P.E.T. gave specific advice about how to implement respectful, non-behavioral-modification discipline, and by discipline I really mean problem-solving.  It's the nuts and bolts of how to effectively problem solve with not only children, but everyone in your life, for those of us whose parents were unaware of how to teach us these skills, as they were not taught to them by their parents either.  Now, P.E.T. and UP has given today's parents the opportunity to stop the cycle of ineffective, disrespectful parenting.       Unconditional Parenting gave me the knowledge and the \\"proof\\" to keep looking for respectful parenting strategies, but if you have strong-willed kids, like me, you need more.  Read P.E.T. and then \\"How to Talk....\\" after that.  Definitely Read UP to give you the fortitude to trust in avoiding punishments and rewards.  I can tell you from personal experience, punishments and rewards start backfiring in a vicious way with strong-willed kids!  And from my own childhood, I can tell you that they can interfere with a more pliable kid's sense of self.    If you want to have a respectful, satisfying relationship with your children, if you want to raise them to take responsibility for their own behavior, without a carrot or a stick in the wings, then read the aforementioned books!
B0002B15XI|5.0|There are really three groups of MASH lovers.  There are those who read the book and love it.  Those who loved the TV series.  Those who loved the movie.  Each group has its reasons why one is better than the other. I read Hooker's two MASH books and  found them funny and in the second one,touching. I enjoyed parts of the TV series, but the movie changed me.  MASH is one of those few movies that people know exactly where they were when they saw this movie and these types of  movies are very rare. I saw MASH in 1970 as a sneak preview to a B motorcycle movie[see my other reviews].  The house was packed because of the first movie and there were very few women there.  The movie started and the  music began and I had no idea what the h__l was going on. As the movie went on I found myself lost in every scene. I laugh because I wanted too, the laughter wasn't forced.  I can remember each scene clearly even today. But as I was watching the movie, I was thinking this isn't Korea, but a jab at Viet Nam.  I slowly realized that I was being shown an anti war movie.  A very good anti war movie that wasn't beating me over the head, but softly creaping into my mind.  In the late 60s and early 70s there were many anti war movies and they were not subtle at all.  People found them to be a big turn off, but not this movie.   Looking back at it now, this movie pole vaulted Sutherland and Gould to superstar status.  We began to see movies with * in the titles, i.e S*P*Y*S, which was horrible.  WIFFS starting Gould was another anti war comedy, I am joking here it was terrible. But these two did do many very good movies, DON\\"T LOOK NOW [best sex scene ever} and the LONG GOODBYE.    MASH opened my eyes to power of movie making, from the great script by Larnder, acting, filming, and theme song.  I never watched this movie again because of the strong impression it left on me.  It colored my view of the TV series and lead me to the books by Richard Hooker.  Don't mention those MASH GOES TOwhatever series.     This generation now remembers only the TV series and then only a lttle.  The kids today may see the TV series on some channel in the afternoon, but go on to something else.  This is to bad because this movie still holds up.  I have listen to students, who saw MASH at their college or in a film study class, rave about how funny it is and how much better it is than the TV series.  They ask me if I have seen it?  I smile and and shake my head.  I have asked them,\\" Is that all it is ?  A comedy?\\"  The answer is always yes.  Today with the wars that are going on, MASH is just a comedy?  Times are a'changing.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|When not re-airing 50-year-old westerns or atrocious horror-movie sequels, AMC has managed to emerge as a leading purveyor of quality TV over the past few years, and Breaking Bad stands with Mad Men as the leading examples of the channel's evolution.  Its portrait of Walter White, a cancer-stricken Albuquerque high-school chemistry teacher who enters the meth business with a former student to provide for his family, provides one of the more outlandish premises currently on TV, but in a world laden with crime procedurals and reality shows it's a huge gift for the discriminating viewer.  Even as events become more sensationalistic in the season's later going, the exacting realism of its setting, the emphasis on the characters, and especially Bryan Cranston's compelling performance as Walt keep the proceedings grounded in reality.  Anyone who enjoyed Cranston's work as the perpetually nervous father on Malcolm in the Middle is in for a real treat here, as he expands on his old signature role with a genuinely ambiguous, darkly funny performance that makes you feel for Walt even as he engages in some inexplicable and occasionally reprehensible acts.  Playing a character who moves over the course of seven episodes from a repressed middle-aged teacher to a swaggering outlaw, Cranston has to project rectitude, alienation, boredom, secrecy, and stubornness in equal measure, and he manages to pull off this balancing act perfectly.<br /><br />When the show begins, Walt's life is pretty much the epitome of suburban normalcy and sterility, almost to the point of parody, from his faux-adobe house to his crossover utility vehicle to his unfulfilling job and predictable family life.  Walt himself pretty much couldn't be more ordinary--even after he's learned about his illness and made the move into the criminal world, Walt's still the kind of guy who, when faced with having to kill a rival, makes a list of pros and cons before taking action.  At the same time, we see the liberating effects that having nothing to lose to start to have on Walt--after all, when you're dying of cancer, it's a lot easier to justify cooking meth, or confronting some jock types making fun of your handicapped son, or blowing up the car of a bluetooth-wearing yuppie d-bag who's stolen your parking spot.  The show wisely avoids passing judgement on Walt or his activities, instead focusing on Walt's motivations and his attempts to negotiate a completely unfamiliar world while concealing his illegal doings from his mildly suspicious wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and his son Walt Jr. (RJ Mitte).  Complicating Walt's life even further, his alpha-male DEA agent brother-in-law Hank starts investigating some of the events surrounding the local meth scene, making Walt's family life uncomfortably entangled with his new profession and adding a whole new layer of tension  and dramatic irony to the show.  As Hank, Dean Norris puts in some of the best work of the season--it would be easy to make him little more than a meatheaded foil for Walt, but Hank emerges as someone very real, who does legitimately believe in what he does for a living.<br /><br />Similarly, as Walt's former student turned partner-in-crime Jesse Pinkman, Aaron Paul initially appears to be little more than a stereotypical white homey type, but Paul eventually manages to turn him into a worthy complement to the more naïve and less seasoned Walt (it helps that he gets a highly disproportionate share of the season's funniest lines).  I especially enjoyed the way the two leads start to rub off on each other as the season goes on, with Walt becoming more comfortable with his illegal activities and Jesse starting to adopt his partner's strict standards of quality.  From the initial formation of Walt and Jesse's uneasy partnership in the first episode, the show manages to wring a great deal of humor and drama (not to mention several unforgettable scenes) from the spectacle of two inexperienced criminals trying to improvisetheir way along as they find themselves increasingly in over their heads.  The last two episodes of the season are especially strong, with Walt trying to move himself and Jesse deeper into the criminal underworld and becoming increasingly bold and fearless in the process, even if it means doing business with memorably psychotic Mexican gang leader Tuco (Raymond Cruz, in an enjoyably over-the-top performance).<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty hard to find anything critical to say of this show.  Even at a mere seven episodes, the first season of Breaking Bad manages to generate more intrigue, emotion, and classic imagery than most shows manage in their entire existence.  Thus far the second season has been even better, so the show clearly hasn't long any of its edge.

B001TH16DS|5.0|To all those people complaining about the price being too high, ARE YOU ON CRACK? it takes simple math to realize this is cheap.    1) You get Both original version and the new CGI version in the same pack, that's like buying Two box sets in one at $40 a set.    2) Two hours of good quality video on blu can usually run you from $20-$35 brand new, just for one disc. This is SEVEN, roughly 8 hours per disc (29 episodes times two [for the original version]), and if you divide the $81 by seven you will come up with a price around $12 per disc, which is not bad.    3) The HD-DVD version was $130 brand new two years ago and it was strictly the CGI stuff, this set has more and is cheaper.    This set is a great deal when you get right down to it.
B00005RDRO|4.0|This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you watch it over and over you will catch somthing new each time. The characterizations of fictional detectives from years ago is dead on, pardon the pun. There is not a weak member of the cast, each does their level best and such a cast of recognizable faces too. If you want a great movie that will continue to hold your attention viewing after viewing, get Murder by Death, you'll laugh till you.......die? Ha!
0375826726|5.0|I loved the first two books, and I couldn't wait for the third.   When I was towards the end of the book that I definitley enjoyed reading I started to cry because of a certain event that happened. I cried because I felt how Eragon felt and also the other characters, because reading the books I sort of felt like I knew them, and experiancing what they whent through. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if a book makes you feel very strong emotions like making you laugh out loud or crying you know it's a realy good book. Well Brisinger was that type of book maybe more so than the first two. This book was the best in the series so far.            Great job Christopher Paolini!   Reveiw by my daughter Aubrey
B001EO748M|4.0|There might be reasons to simply dismiss Showtime's historical docudrama series on England's Tudor dynasty as a waste of time. Some might find this royal soap opera to be a royal bore. Others might quibble about historical inaccuracies. Unless you plan to use the series as preparation for a test on 16th Century London or can't seem to get excited about any video lacking a car chase, however, you should take the time to look a little closer at Season Two of \\"The Tudors\\" for several good reasons.<br /><br />The first is Jeremy Northam's sobering portrayal of the courageous heroic intellectual genius of Medieval England, Sir Thomas More.<br /><br />The second is to gain a real appreciation of the contributions of Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) to Western Civilization, spawning both the English religious reformation and England's greatest monarch, Elizabeth I.<br /><br />A third is to understand the role of  personal motives in historical transitions. Without his selfish attraction to Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) and obsession with securing a divorce from wife number one, Henry VIII never would have challenged the Roman Catholic Church to create the Church of England.<br /><br />Theatrical history indicates that Season Two of \\"The Tudors\\" likely will rank as the most dramatic, since that period has generated two powerful and lauded feature length films in \\"[[ASIN:B000LPR6GA A Man for All Seasons (Special Edition)]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000RF7XYY Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of Scots]].\\" This longer Showtime shot at combining those two stories demonstrates the power of TV when harnessed effectively to develop story lines in greater depth and detail.<br /><br />Who needs a car chase when \\"The Tudors\\" offers multiple beheadings, graphic sex, palace intrigue and application of the royal sneer so artfully managed by Meyers?
B000001DYA|4.0|This is the album I put on whenever I need to get in touch with my inner sixteen year old!<br /><br />And speaking of being 16 and high school and all that, I remember asking some of the kids who had taken Latin (which I didn't get around to 'til college) what \\"Vincebus Eruptum,\\" and no one could tell me for sure.  Turns out it didn't really MEAN anything, I later learned.  But it didn't quite mean \\"nothing\\" either. Most English speakers recognize the roots of these pseudo words (\\"vincebus\\" derived from VINCERE (\\"to defeat, to win\\")and \\"eruptum's\\" kinda obvious, wouldn't you say?)  It was a playful, defiantly pseudo-erudite title.<br /><br />Some maintain that Blue Cheer's sound was as inauthentic as their Latin, but that's missing the point.  It may seem like the band was a poor man's Hendrix without the necessary experience, but that was the beauty part. Hendrix was at least 50% technical wizardry and was capable of being, you know, kinda subtle (not a BAD thing, of course, but not at all PUNK or proto-punk).  These guys were.  A friend of mine complained once to me that all the songs on VINCEBUS ERUPTUM were in the same key, same tempo, same volume level  \\"Precisely,\\" I responded!<br /><br />He probably thought I was agreeing with him.

B001TK3XO0|3.0|This book is simply OK. It is very predictable and is not even in the same category as 'The Kite Runner'. I would suggest (reading 'The Kite Runner, and passing on 'A Thousand Splendid Suns). The plot is predictable and the characters are not very well developed. It isn't a terrible read, but simply isn't a good read either
0783228007|5.0|Good Entertainment, with circa 1900 firearms, but no 1892 or '94 Winchesters, the \\"Gun that Won the West\\".  So, what's the deal,.. What would John Wayne think?
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Austraila was too long.  Some of the story could have been left out and it would still be good.  The stars were good but not great.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I first saw this movie as a child, yes,it is Hollywood at it 60s finest. Very entertaining even if the costumes and sets are a little to perfect for the actual time period.
B000002G0P|4.0|Definitely an Extreme album for fans.   In my opinion, the first two albums where mindbogglingly insane!!!!  To the untrained ear, they may sound like Van Halen, but they exceed Van Halen/Hagar.  These guys are more electric!!  Unmatched, it's understandable why they labeled themselves under \\"Funky Metal\\".     In this 3rd outing, it kinda feels as if the group lost their youthful spirit.  Of course, some tracks may make you think otherwise.  One thing that stands out about this ablum is that it feels more poetic... almost philosophical.  The full orchestra is a commendable try, though it may come off basic at times, it's necessary to emphasize the grander moments.     With that said, the more I listen to it, the more it grows on me.  I only discovered this album a month ago, and I've known of Extreme for 6 months.
068485743X|4.0|I found the first four-fifths of the book too obvious to be of any value, but the last fifth (on scene setting, pace and progression, etc.) was indeed valuable, and the chapter on \\"subtlety\\" worth the price of the book, and more, all by itself. Probably my background as a copy editor and my newness as a fiction writer accounts for my reactions. When I read the chapter on subtlety, I thought, \\"I should have known this!\\" but I didn't know it, at least not thoroughly enough, and I'm grateful to have read it.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This film presents a view of Mozart that is a big contrast from the \\"traditional\\" historical image.  Although Mozart most likely did not have the mannerisms displayed in the film, they certainly imply how he may have viewed himself and those around him.  This dramatic license also helps to show him as a human being, not some mythic god of music.  The film definitely shows his musical genius as something he just took for granted.  Any student of Mozart should view this film and synthesize it with other historical perspectives.  Of course, the death theory is still only a theory, as his true cause of death may never be proven conclusively.  But, it is the most popular one and makes for an interesting film.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This movie is a classic and one that I enjoyed as a child growing up. The xtras on this set make it even more endearing for young and old alike.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|I own every Diana Krall piece of music and of course like some more than others. Of all of her CDs this is the worst.  Funeral music is more moving than this.  Since she married Elvis Costello she has not produced the kind of jazz playing that she's capable of.  She can swing on that piano with the best of them and play subtle tunes just as well.  These songs are just boring and slowwwwwww!  I hate to do it to her, but I can only give this one star.  A big disappointment.

045122499X|5.0|This is a not-that-common 1000+ pages book that keeps you curious and eager to read more. Books this long usually take a while to develop the story or get stuck in marasms half-way. Not World Without End.   Set on 14th century England, this is the 40 year saga of a group of kids that live near the town of Kingsbridge. As they grow, they lives cross paths multiple times.   The story, by itself, is already interesting, as the drama unfolds and each kid goes through life with ambition, dreams, setbacks, envies, fears, and so on. But perhaps what makes this book so enticing is that Follett was able to create a plausible setting for the 14th century. The reader gets to follow the economics and political dynamics of the time, the interactions and relationships between Church, royalty, merchants, peasants.   In all, a great book to read.  The few circumstances in which I think this won't be a great read are either if you're looking for a top-notch Nobel type of literary material (the characters could be more complex) or if reading a 1000 pages book is too much for you. Otherwise, enjoy!
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Metallica wantabees!  Music is way to simple to get any enjoyment out of and the lyrics make you want to go take a shower after listening.  Horrible worthless music.  This is only for the mindless.  So if you are deaf dumb and stupid you may want to buy this cd.
B00006IUL7|5.0|INSOMNIA is a fantastic thriller, full of twists, turns, and arctic-cold atmosphere. Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Scarface, Heat, etc.) is LA homicide detective Will Dormer, sent to Nightmute, Alaska to investigate a murder. Will has a lot of professional / personal baggage that complicates matters, causing him to hide his own secrets while trying to solve the crime. Add to this the fact that he's arrived in northern Alaska during it's season of perpetual daylight, and he's got major sleeping problems as well! Between the murder case, the eternal daylight, and Will's own conscience, he quickly becomes a mess! It's amazing that he can still function at all, let alone, well. Hilary Swank (The Gift, 11:14) is a young officer who assists Dormer, only to find her own loyalties and sense of justice challenged. Robin Williams (One Hour Photo, The Night Listener) plays a seemingly mild-mannered sociopath whose one frantic desire is to cover / save his own a$$! INSOMNIA succeeds at building tension while showing Will Dormer's mental disintegration. A classic crime drama w/ something extra. Loaded w/ memorable scenes like the chase-in-the-fog, chase-across-the-floating-logs, and invisible-oncoming-truck sequences, INSOMNIA holds up well after many repeat viewings. Highly recommended...    P.S.- Watch for both Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins from the GINGER SNAPS movies, as the victim's best friend and the eulogizer at her funeral respectively...
B00000099Y|5.0|Its really ironic.     That Tool's crowning acheivement to the masses on Amazon is Nick's review. There on the front page of Aenima, Nick has over 1000 helpful votes, where he implores the reader to 'vote yes' to his review if they love tool and disagree with the 4.5 stars. A review that appeals to the most superficial of impulsions.         Aenima is a phillisophical masterpiece. Stripping the body of flesh, it swarms into the psyche, and swims its way through the spiritual realm.   And what Tool see is dark and engrossing as it is beautiful and liberating.     The album's chaotic tug of war is spellbinding. And from what I have read of negative reviews is the source of most criticism.  Here is where the confusion lies. Tool is not a heavy metal band. They defy the verse chorus verse onslaught of this genre. This isnt armagedon whereby the listener is treated to wave after wave of explosions. Tool is more like a rattle snake, spitting, shaking, tensing and then finally biting your f~c(ing head off in the final exchange. This will bore listeners with a short attention span whilst completely enthralling the patient listeners. Most of Tool's crushing blows come in the final moments of their songs, which is obviously missed by people who tend to skip tracks halfway on their easily accessible ipods. I know, I too was guilty of this the first time round. But it was my brothers persistance that eluded me to the fact that I need to listen start to finish.            Here is a way for the short attention listeners to get started.  Start with  1.Stinkfist  2.Aenima   3.Hooker with a Penis  4.Forty Six and two  5.H.  6.Eulogy  (slowly develop an attention for the music this way)  Just listen to each one individually until cooked before proceeding to the next track.     For each track  After 2-3 listens a melody starts to reveal itself... a few more listens  then turns into a few more swarming but striking melodies... then the lyrics bite... and finally once you start to abosrb the dynamics, it culminates into something much more mesmerising than anything you have heard before. Have you ever stared at one of those images which turn 3D if you concentrate hard enough. Or have you ever stared into the clear night sky and notice that the longer you stare the more stars that start to appear that you couldnt see before.   ITs there... it just takes time to train the senses. The reward is yours and yours alone.       After step 6 only then are you ready to embark on the album in its entirety as one cohesive ensemble. I am convinced you wont regret it. I cant believe I was stubborn enough all these years not to give this masterpiece my full attention. It took one weekend and now its been weeks I cant stop carrying it around.        And Nick...  well Nick makes this some sort of race. Dehumanizes, packages and serves this as a yes-no vote. Dare I say, even corrupts and profits.   What is the point. Just be thankful you had the mind to hear it.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|This is a very enjoyable movie. Woody Allen has a real ability to dream up crazy story lines and weave all their sub-plots into a stylish and entertaining whole. Vicky Christina Barcelona is no exception. While some reviewers found this movie `sombre' in fact I laughed a lot, much more than in `Match Point' for example, but there is no doubt that Woody Allen has a dark side. I get the feeling whenever I watch a film of his that underneath it all there is something unhealthy going on. This is well disguised by the humour but pessimism and sexual hang-ups as well as genius blend in with this very interesting, very flawed and very brilliant director.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|To say this movie is pretty much the worst one ever made it would be an insult to excrement the world over, and please spare yourself the pain, because I agree that I did enjoy the movie, but, however, it's pretty much the worst movie ever made, and NEVER BUY THIS MOVIE, BECAUSE THAT'S A BAD ONE, AND IT'S THE WORST ONE EVER MADE. This is not a movie that you probably can't handle, so, I would throw that movie in the garbage and say \\"I've had enough of this movie, take it away\\", because Liar Liar with Jim Carrey, Me, Myself and Irene with Jim Carrey and Step Brothers with John C. Reilly are just the worst movies and videos ever made, plus they are not making any friends of me and, they're just not the best, so never watch them and don't buy them, because I'd call those four movies a 'phony', and I agree that those movies are pretty fakey looking, as I say those four movies of \\"Liar Liar\\" starring Jim Carrey, \\"Step Brothers\\" starring Will Farrell, \\"Me, Myself and Irene\\" starring Jim Carrey, and \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" starring Jon Heder, all four of them are pure fake and pretty wacky and those four movies are not ones I would own, and yes, I can agree that they are pretty wacky and just...

159102594X|4.0|This ain't for little people.  There are no good guys in this series, only bad guys and worse ones. The most sympathetic characters are a berserker killer and a torturer.  And just like in reality, victories don't bring happiness.    I found the whole series a page turner, but don't look for happy endings.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|The melodies are pleasant, the music is for the most part pleasant, if occasionally a little Springsteen damaged, especially (Antichrist Television Blues). The best thing I can say about the music is that it's instrumentally lush, and well done even if fairly unadventurous. Though I really liked the gradual crescendo of \\"Windowsill\\" and \\"No Cars Go\\" is sonically great, very nice. The best thing I can say about the lyrics is that they're easily ignorable, which is a good thing. At my age I really don't have much tolerance for the \\"poetic truths of high school journal keepers\\" as Lee Ranaldo once said, anymore. Portentous angst being the order of the day. Jesus, lighten up a little, take a deep breath, serenity now. The worst thing I can say about this album is that it doesn't reach me emotionally. I find it comfortable, likeable even, yet bland as if all the sharp edges have been sanded off. For your protection of course. File under \\"meh\\"
B000K7VHPU|3.0|The Illusionist brings to the screen the love story between the son of a furniture maker and a daughter of Austrian aristocracy. It is 19th century Austria and two kids fall in love only to be forcefully separated by those who see the relationship as \\"unfitting.\\" Nevertheless, the two lovebirds' paths cross again only this time the young lady is betrothed to the heir of the Austrian throne...<br />In short, it is a great setting with an interesting plot/storyline and with a predictable political agenda consisting of not-so-hidden messages for which the writers and director are responsible.<br />The not-so-hidden politics behind the movie has to do with the presence (of course!) of the evil European. What a coincidence that Abramowitz-Eisenheim is the \\"good guy\\" while the Germanic Austrian royalist and heir to the throne is the villain; very original indeed...<br />Aside from the not-so-subtle and not-so-hidden political agenda, the movie does a good job of providing a fairly generous dose of entertainment.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|It's not that this is over-produced, per se, but on a lot of the tracks you can't help but listen and feel like she's trying too hard.  \\"The Boy From Ipanema\\" is particularly annoying.  Aside from the lyric changes- why?- her pace and the odd enunciation she has on certain words makes me wince.  On many of the tunes, it feels like she's behind the beat.  That's okay- not a lot of people complain about Sinatra or Fitzgerald's use of that technique- but I happen to find it irksome.<br /><br />Krall the musician sometimes ruins songs for me.  This is not the first album I've heard of hers where she spends way, way too long setting a song up (sorry, I don't know what the musical term is).  I like piano jazz as much as anyone else, but sometimes it just doesn't work when it's combined with vocals.  Again, this is a personal preference- I'm sure Krall has a lot of fans who like her unique combination of vocal and piano artistry- but I'm not a fan.<br /><br />This album is hardly a disaster.  \\"Too Marvelous\\", \\"Accustomed to Your Face\\", \\"Walk on By\\" and \\"Quiet Nights\\" are very well done, and I can't stop listening to \\"So Nice\\".  Those songs feel unforced and allow the listener to get lost in the rhythm and flow of the work.  If Krall had been able to deliver like that on all of her tracks, I'd have given it five stars.

B001IMFHTS|5.0|In 2001, during the month of February, the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Claudio Abbado, were in residence at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome to play all nine of the Beethoven symphonies. The first eight symphonies were recorded for television by the renowned music film producer Paul Smaczny and directed for television by Bob Coles. The 9th had already been recorded in Berlin the year before with a distinguished cast of singers -- Karita Mattila, Violeta Urmana, Thomas Moser, and Eike Wim Schulte, along with the Swedish Radio Choir and the legendary Eric Ericson Chamber Choir -- and it is that performance that is included here. These performances have been released on four single DVDs previously, but this compilation box set of four discs is now available from Euroarts for an amazingly low price, much lower than than if you bought the single discs. You can read other customer reviews of the single issues here: [[ASIN:B00016MSZ8 Beethoven - Symphonies 1, 6, and 8 / Claudio Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic]], [[ASIN:B00016MSYO Beethoven - Symphonies 2 and 5 / Claudio Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic]], [[ASIN:B00016MSZS Beethoven - Symphonies 3 and 9 / Abbado, Mattila, Urmana, Moser, Schulte, Berlin Philharmonic]], and [[ASIN:B00016MT02 Beethoven - Symphonies 4 and 7 / Claudio Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic]]. I have not reviewed the single issues but will not linger here to offer a review of each disc. I will simply say that for me Abbado is the master conductor of the present age and that his Beethoven interpretations, using the recently completed B&auml;renreiter edition of the symphonies done by English musicologist Jonathan del Mar, are almost universally hailed. The main achievement of this edition is the removal of hundreds of errors that crept into the first edition and have been perpetuated, or have multiplied, in subsequent editions. Abbado chooses to use somewhat reduced string sections in Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, 4 & 8, as is fitting for their gentler spirit. These same Rome and Berlin performances have been issued in a CD box set [[ASIN:B001795SH8 Beethoven: The Symphonies [Box Set]]] and in my view are generally preferred to his earlier issued traversal on Deutsche Grammophon [[ASIN:B00004YZ33 Beethoven - Die Symphonien (Symphonies 1-9) / Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic]], which in addition is hugely more expensively priced. Interestingly, the present DVD box set costs less at Amazon than the CD box set. Go figure!<br /><br />Interpretively these performances tend to be a bit on the fast side, with absolutely clear sonics and transparent balances. The men and women of the Berliner Philharmoniker, a younger group than we had been used to even a decade earlier, play like angels. Abbado himself had just been through a harrowing bout with stomach cancer and looks very thin but otherwise healthy in these performances. He says of this period, 'Music is the best medicine. More than any other form of therapy, it is music that has helped me through these last few difficult months.' Visually, the performances on DVD are neatly photographed. In several of the symphonies -- Nos. 3, 5, 6 & 7 -- the viewer has the option of viewing the performance in a 'Conductor's View' in addition to the usual 'Concert View' by use of the 'angle' button on the DVD's remote control. The 'Conductor's View' simply focuses on Abbado from the orchestra's perspective.<br /><br />In addition to the bonus of the 'Conductor's View', there is, on the disc with with Symphonies Nos. 4 & 7, a half-hour interview with Abbado talking about his understanding of and response to the music of Beethoven.<br /><br />These performances gave me enormous pleasure and I can't recommend them highly enough.<br /><br />Running time: 6hrs, 34mins; Format: NTSC 16:9; Sound: PCM Stereo, DD 5.1; DTS 5.1; Substitles: German, English, French, Italian, Spanish; Region code: 0 (worldwide).<br /><br />Scott Morrisonese same Rome and Berlin performances have been issued in a CD box set [[ASIN:B001795SH8 Beethoven: The Symphonies [Box Set]]] and in my view are generally preferred to his earlier issued traversal on Deutsche Grammophon [[ASIN:B00004YZ33 Beethoven - Die Symphonien (Symphonies 1-9) / Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic]], which in addition is hugely more expensively priced.

0316017922|5.0|Love him or hate him, agree or disagree with his theses, the one thing you can't argue with is Malcolm Gladwell knows how to tell a story.  Continuing with the successful form used in his two earlier novels, [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point]] and [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink]], the longtime writer for the New Yorker tackles various forms of success in his latest, Outliers.  Using an easily readable style full of historical, sociological, and psychological studies interspersed with fascinating anecdotes from the involved parties, Gladwell creates vivid and compelling arguments for the success of groups and individuals as varied as Canadian hockey players, mergers and acquisitions attorneys, and Bill Gates.  He also puts a unique twist on such stereotypes as \\"Asians are better at math than other ethnic groups,\\" essentially proving them, but not necessarily for the reasons you expect.    The most amazing thing about Gladwell's thesis is that the formula for success is one that just about anyone can implement.  Like a lot of self-help books, Outliers' explanations just feel right; they're borderline common sense but the ways in which they're described is done with such precision and clarity that you can't help but walk away feeling like you've read something profound.  Gladwell's topics tickle something in the back of our minds, something that says, \\"Yes, this really is how stuff works.\\"    That being said, the one criticism I have of Outliers (as well as Gladwell's other books) is that it may be too powerful.  In all of his works, the author goes out of his way to point out that there are unconventional reasons behind some pretty complex aspects of life, but then focuses exclusively on these unique parts.  It is this focus that tends to get readers thinking  about other possible non-intuitive causes for not only undiscussed areas of life, but also for the aspects Gladwell himself discusses!  Eventually you start thinking, for example, that coming from a rice growing culture isn't the only reason why Asians excel at math; that maybe, just maybe, there are other, unthought of elements behind it.  But, in all reality, this is an empty criticism, since when did a novel that gets you thinking too much become a bad thing?    And, in the end, Malcolm Gladwell's works are always a fun ride.  His popularity no doubt stems from his storyteller ability, which typically revolves around a mysterious setup, followed by a building tension, and then hitting you with the reveal.  This may be formulaic, but its quite effective.  And effective storytelling that gets you thinking?  That's all right by me.
0446579939|3.0|I just finished the book and I was curious on what other people thought of this book.  I was surprised at how much people liked it.  Have read a couple of Nick Sparks books and I have to say this one has to be one of my least favorites.  I felt bored for the most part.  I did not really get interested into the book until almost half way into it.  Once I did get into the book I started to enjoy it.  I do think that once Logan does admit he has the photo to Beth I feel like her reaction was a little overboard.  I just feel it was a little bit much.  In all I don't know if I would tell someone to read it.  I would rather recommend one of his other books that are much better.
0545128285|5.0|Beedle the Bard has an incredible originality that separates itself from other short novels.  It is a collection of fairy tales, with character commentary on the side.  Its an excellent idea that was executed excellently.  The fairy tales are as thoughtful and creative as our traditional fairy tales in our homes.  I would suggest that parents use these once their children hit a higher age, to wisen them about greed, distrust, and selfishness.  This novel really hits the spot and targets those bad qualities that we want to educate our children about.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this novel, and being a reader who hasn't finished the Harry Potter series, I followed the story right along without trouble.  It is really a novel separate from the series, rather than added on to it.  This reminds me of what Pullman did with Lyra's Oxford, but this novel does way more justice to its franchise.  Have fun reading, because this book doesn't bore.
1427206031|3.0|I am a big fan of Jeffrey Archer's work.  I've been reading him since my childhood in the 70's.  More than anything else, I've always thought of him as one hell of a story-teller.  Some of his novels are stronger than others, but for decades now, I've always come back for more.  Therefore, even though I have no particular interest in mountain climbing, I looked forward with anticipation to reading Archer's latest, Paths of Glory.<br /><br />Paths of Glory is the story of real-life mountain climber George Lee Mallory and his epic quest to scale Everest.  The novel opens with the discovery a decade ago of Mallory's frozen body near the summit of Everest, where it had remained since 1937--never quite answering the mystery of whether he made it to the top.  From that beginning, we go back to Mallory's early childhood and are treated to a fictional biography of the major events of his life.  Family, school, marriage, and the drive to explore are all covered.  Additionally, Archer gives the reader one version of what might have happened that final day in 1937, and even an epilogue regarding the fates of the other major and minor players.<br /><br />It wasn't bad.  I didn't actively dislike it.  But I find myself hard-pressed to recommend the novel.  It was a reasonably likable, easy read, but there seemed to be so little of substance ultimately.  Really, it felt like one cute story after another, all strung along to illustrate why Mallory was such a generically worthy, likable guy.  I can't help thinking that there must have been so much more to the man.  Nor did Archer do a particularly vivid job of painting the times in which Mr. Mallory lived.  If Mallory really was the hero he was painted to be, I think he probably deserved better.<br /><br />I should also mention that I listened to this novel as an unabridged audiobook.  The narrator Roger Allam, did a passable job, but wasn't particularly strong on accents.  In the end, Allam failed where Archer failed...  They took a true story but never managed to bring it to life.r managed to bring it to life.

B001JNNE64|1.0|I am aware that sometimes a movie take liberties about the subject they depict but in the case of Amadeus we are not talking about liberties, but about complete and utterly false distortions of who Mozart was, and about his life and history.  Had this movie been about a fictional character, I would have judged it as very good. But since it claims to be about Mozart, than lets get some facts straight (I wont even touch the subject of Mozart's genius - suffice to say he was the greatest composer who ever lived, and every composer who lived after him recognised this)  - Mozart never signed any composition with the name Amadeus - but with Amade. Mozart's name was actually Teophillus or Gottlieb - which in latin would translate to Amadeus, but he never used the latin name, instead he used the french translation - Amade.  - Mozart was NOT a poor guy, whose talent was unappreciated by his contemporaries. In fact Joseph Haydn, one of Mozart closest friends - and of course not shown in this picture - has said, in 1785, to Mozarts father Leopold, during Leopold's visit in Viena : \\"Your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name\\" (in the movie Salieri is credited with this line). Mozart was the first free-lance composer the world has ever know, and he was making A LOT of money. He lived in a house in central Vienna, had servants and a carriage (big thing in those days). He was probably the best dressed in all Vienna, and everybody who knew his recognized that Mozart had a sublime and perfect taste in everything he did.   - The myth of Mozart poverty comes from two facts. Nr. 1 - he was buryied in the common grave. Of course, it's never mentioned that 90% of Viena's population at that time was buryied in the same way, since there was an imperial edict forbidding individual graves to anybody but the aristocracy. Nr. 2 - he borrowed money once or twice from a friend in 1788. Well, Austria was at war those days, the economy was in shambles, and Mozart, asa freelance composer, whitout a patron to support him, had to adjust. But at his death he was not a poor man, 1791 was a great year for him, as he made quite a little fortune with ZauberFlote and La Clementa di Tito, as well and some other works that he publised.  - Mozart seldom drank. He probably enjoyed a glass of wine once in a while, but he was NOT the alcoholic shown in the movie.  - Mozart never cheated on his wife - if fact he was one of the most straitforward of all composers, probably as much as Bach. He loved Constanze with all his heart, and she loved him back the same way. There are hundreds of letter that survie to prove this. Constanze never cheated on him either, she gave birth to six children, of who only 2 survied to adulthood. She never dumped Mozart - but due to health problem she went to Baden a couple of times (which was not cheap, and Mozart paid for it)  - Salieri and Mozart never had any problems or dispute, in fact they even were on the same stage a some point. Leopold - who was a conspiracy theory addict - claimed that there was a cabala of italians that conjured against him and Wolfgang, but later on, when Mozart broke away from his father, he realized that this was not true. In fact, later on, Constantze trusted the musical education of her two surviving sons (not one, as depicted in the movie) to Salieri. Whould a mother have trusted her sons to the man who murdered their father?  - Salieri was a great composer, one of the best of his time. His music is not in the repertoire anymore, but lets remember that at that time there were hundreds of composers, who wrote tons of music, since in a time with no TV, CD, iPOD, cinema, etc, music was all there was. The fact only two names from that era are still performed today, Mozart and Haydn, is a testament to their great genius, and not a proof that the others were bad, or mediocre. Salieri was one of the best composers around at that time, and this is why Beethoven chose to select his as his canto teacher in the 1790's. He was also a very generous man, who helped a lot o people in his life. It is claimed that later in his life, in 1822, when he was in a mental hospital, he admited to poisoning Mozart, but this is denied  by the two servants that cared for him (those two depicted at the beginning of the movie), who declared under oath that he never said that.   - Mozart was not a vulgar man. There are hundreds of leters surviving him to prove this. He used some foul language sometimes, but in a clever way, not in the grotesque way depicted in the movie.  - Mozart did not died alone. He was surounded by his whole family, and his final ilness span over 6 weeks. It is not sure what it was, but the final blow that led to his death was the medical treatment he was submitted to. As his wife's sister recalls - he was severly bled that night (blood letting was the miracle cure for everything in those days), after which he never regained consciousness, and died the following morning. The treatment was applied by one of the best doctors of the time - another proof that Mozart was not a poor guy. Sophie Weber claimed that the procedure seemed to have made Mozart worse, but that he would have died anyway. Let me have some serious doubts on this.  - Magic Flute was premiered some 3 month before Mozart death. In fact Mozart had time to write quite a few things inbetween, including the opera La Clemenza di Tito. The Magic Flute was extremely succesfull, and was preformed almost every other night at Shickaneder's theatre, bringing a lot of cash to Mozart. In 1892 it already reached 100 performances.  - Don Giovanni was actually comissioned by the Opera in Prague, where it was a great succes. It was comissioned after the huge succes of Le Nozze di Figaro. Mozart was venerated like a god in Prague.   - Although Mozart was tidyer than other composers, Beethoven for instance, he was not pouring out music dictated by god with the only duty to write it down. He worked very hard for his composition, and he was not afraid to cut and throw away what he was not satisfied with.  - Reqviem was comisioned not by Salieri, but by count Franz von Walsegg, who had the habit of comissioning works from different composers and then publish them as his own. Mozart knew who he was composing the reqviem for. He was working on it when he died, and left it unfinished.     And the list goes on, like for instance the King not being able to play well the piano - Joseph II was in fact a skilled piano player and sometimes even played on stage; or Mozart composing Noze di Figaro without the king knowing about it - the opposite is actually true, the king knew and first approved of the text of Da Ponte, and then Mozart started working on it.    Mozart was a great man. A great musical genius, but also a nice and considerate person, who has almost never iritated and morose, a nice guy who almost never spoke a bad word about anybody. He was perfectly aware of his genius - but what genius is not?    He deserves a lot more than the parody he is given in this movie.
B001PR0Y4Y|5.0|I got to see this film at a sneak preview.  I got free tickets at an 80's club I frequent.  I only had a mild interest in seeing this film when I saw the trailers.  In other words, this one was going to be one to wait for on dvd.  Free is free, and I went with a tribe of folks on a Wednesday night.<br /><br />To my surprise, this was a really sweet, funny, well-acted, and truly great film.  Yes, this is a film, not some flash-in-the-pan, cash in on the youth market, gross out comedy.  Sure, it has elements of that too, but they're more subdued and the humor is less broad and more sublte.  It's basically about characters you already know or have met in your life.  It takes place in the 80's and it's basica plot involves the horror any 20-something would face during a recession, getting a really crappy summer job!<br /><br />The real revelation I found with this film came in the form of Kristen Stewart.  She's the real deal.  I had seen her in Twilight recently and found everything anyone did in that film to be hollow.  Here, she really shows her acting chops playing a confused youth afraid of the unknown.  Jesse Eisenberg is the main character in the film, and I expected nothing but greatness from him, I previously saw him in the brilliant The Squid and the Whale.  He is a very talented young actor who I expect to see a lot more from in the future.<br /><br />The film has all the details of a youth summer job that sucks pegged.  Everything from the one hot-chick that everyone wants, the low-rent customers, the over-zealous and possibly dellusional bosses, and on-job romance.  It's all done with genuine emotion and situations.  Nothing feels contrived or forced.  Characters make mistaks and things go wrong, but there are no moments of the characters becoming overwrought and giving prefunctory speeches regarding the film's main themes.  This is really well written.<br /><br />I must warn all the video game obsessed, vapid, youth drones about what they're getting with this film.  It has real characters, and a believable situation.  It's a hang-out picture.  You just spend time getting to know a particular group of characters who share the same crappy theme park summer job.  There is no contrived plot devices, like switched or confused identities, no one is masquarading as one of the opposite sex, no plot devices to keep a false narrative going, and no gags just stuck in the film like an overlong action sequence to get yucks.  Yes, the kids get wasted and high, but it has more to do with them coping with their boredom, and it also helps lead to their bonding.<br /><br />The film manages to be honestly touching as well, something I really didn't expect from this piece.  It was made by the same director of Super Bad, a really brilliant and funny youth comedy, but it is nothing like it.  It's not as great, but its not going for the same thing.  The humor comes from character and honest situations and not from over-blown comic situations just set up for the yucks.<br /><br />If this film would've been advertised differently, I would've paid to see it.s, and a believable situation.

B000SEHG5U|2.0|Dawkins certainly has a knack with words and did a great job of entertaining his audience.  However, I was hoping to be challenged more.  Once the cover of this book is cracked it is clear that the majority of it's readers had already made up their mind about God's existence.  More was expected from a famed Oxford professor who, according to the book jacket is \\"one of the worlds top three intellectuals\\", and if this is the best the atheist community has to offer I'm left even more disappointed.   In this book Dawkins tries to show the reader that God is in fact not real, and has been made up by humans to explain things that are otherwise unexplainable.  He defines the delusion in these words, \\"there exists a super human, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed the universe and everything in it, including us.\\"  Dawkins' only proof offered in support reads, \\"any creative intelligence of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.\\"  Eventually Dawkins does turn to science for support of his premise but in my opinion he does so with very little success.    Dawkins advocates for the advancement of science and the annihilation of the religious.  I argue that the two overlap and do so in perfect harmony.  If someone is diagnosed with cancer and after being prayed for that cancer is gone.  Science confirms that the cancer has disappeared!  This is a clear example of science and the supernatural working together.  Gary Habermas has done some very convincing work in the area of miracles perhaps Dawkins could look to him.  Dawkins speaks to the mathematical probability that God does not exist.  Again he's mistaken.  If just one of the many universal constants is altered by the smallest of fractions there'd be a lifeless universe.  Isn't it much more likely that there's a Creator?  Hugh Ross has done a great job in relating the fine tuning of the universe and Dawkins might do well to look into Ross' books.   The argument that sticks out most is relating the belief in God to that of a flying spaghetti monster.  Perhaps the reason this is so memorable is because this has became the \\"t-shirt\\" argument for Dawkins and his followers.  Is this book actually saying the evidence for the God of the Bible is on the same plain as that of Santa Claus or the tooth fairy?  To respond to this we must look at the reliability of the Bible.  Using the scriptures as strictly historical accounts one can see that Dawkins spaghetti monster argument is to appeal only to the emotions of his audience, not their intellect.   To the readers of \\"The God Delusion\\" I implore you to look elsewhere for answers to the very important questions of meaning and origin.  Ultimately, it's quite clear that \\"The God Delusion\\" was written as a call to atheists to pick up their arms and enter into political action.  I was expecting to get some thoughtful insight into the existence of God but instead got the rantings of a very smart man with a very clear agenda based on flawed arguments wrapped in the most closed of minds.

In fact, perhaps half way through I became engrossed in the story and just brushed through the math portions.  I have recommended the book to friends who would be baffled by the term \\"cube root\\" and they loved it.    One of the few books that address the mental effect on a Japanese soldier of the years long grind as they suffered continuous defeats at the hands of a people they felt were in all ways their inferior.    The interweave of modern and WWII characters and issues is superb.

He laughes so hard at \\"the Grinch\\", Jim Carrey does an amazing job. I thought he would get scared but he doesn't at all. He watches it over and over. I don't mind because I always find something new and there is some mild adult humor that he can't pick up on.

B000NA2776|4.0|Mika is amazing. I could not get the \\"Grace Kelly\\" song out of my head for weeks. I bought the CD over a year ago and I still listen to it at least 8x a week. His voice is so amazing, his lyrics are catchy and hilarious, and he plays the piano so well. I love his look and the fact that his sister created his CD cover is really touching.<br /><br />He has not said anything about his sexuality but I have to say if you are not open to all kinds of music you probably won't like him.<br /><br />ALL my friends LOVE this CD and whenever I introduce him to someone they want to play his entire CD over and over and over. His songs are just so positive and happy it puts me in a great mood. The only reason I do not give him 5 stars is because there are about 3 songs that are somewhat slow and dull. But overall I can't wait to hear more from him.<br /><br />I do not think he is a rip off of Queen at all. It is obvious that he created his style of music based on that but they are VERY different. Love Love Love him!!!!
055358894X|5.0|\\"Rich\\" is the word that keeps coming up as I talk to people about this book and it's sequel.<br /><br />Lynch is one of the most original and engaging new authors I've ever read. It's hard to believe this is his first book. It's a great read that satisfies on many levels. It \\"feels\\" like a classic .. but also completely original.<br /><br />It's a little bit Fafhrd-and-the-Grey-Mouser-meets-Ocean's-Eleven, with a side of Oliver Twist and a dash of Renaissance Italy.<br /><br />And it's a good mix. It left me satisfied with an extremely well-told tale ... but still wanting more of these characters and their world. I fell in love with Locke - and his friends and his world - within just a few pages and I could. not. put it down.<br /><br />In addition to a refreshingly original protagonist, story and voice, Lynch offers an amazingly detailed and unique world and fully realized \\"supporting\\" characters.<br /><br />Lynch's narrative style - jumping back and forth between Locke's past and present - was VERY skillfully done. It *could* have been distracting and disjointed. Instead, it brilliantly serves to reveal Locke (and the other characters and even the city - which is almost a character unto itself) to the reader a little bit at a time - like slowly and tantalizingly peeling away layers of wrapping to reveal the prize within.<br /><br />This was hands-down one of my favorite books I read in 2008. I was completely drawn in to this amazing world and emotionally invested in the characters.  I enjoyed it so much, I immediately ordered the sequel, Red Seas Under Red Skies and devoured that as quickly as the first. I am eagerly awaiting the release of the third installment.

B001PA0FF4|4.0|You have 62 reviews on this A budget movie with it's incredible<br />powerhouse performances and most of them rightly gave this movie great reviews.  I can't understand a review of less than three stars though.  Anyway the movie like the play makes you think hard about Doubt and inspite of the outcome of the movie we are left with incertitude that the lead character is in fact a abuser , maybe he just didn't want to have other issues dragged up in his past.  Who knows? the viewer may assume that the priest is guilty or not but the fierce performance of Meryl Streep leads us NO doubt that her character really does care about the welfare of the children in her school; even if she doesn't show it in a loving way. The movie does have alot of dialog but watching it, was to me like looking back in time, in a pretty much faithful way, to that era of history fairly accurately.  The early sixties were a time before the storm and people still were in denial about many issues and they certainly had a hard time talking about them.  This is a excellent drama and should stand the test of time because of it's great performances and<br />doubtful musings and endings.  The print looks beautiful on blu ray and every detail stands out nicely in this perfect print.  This is a movie that is a acting tour de force and blu ray is only way to go if you want to own this.

B000002JPA|5.0|This album is a staple in time in my opinion.It's the most unique out of every record this band has done. I'd have to say it's their most \\"SOFT\\" record, but that doesn't associate with bad music, or lack of quality. I miss Kevin Moore being apart of this band. He had some creative ideas that spoke volumes in their music, he wasn't super flashy or technical but in my opinion he didn't have to be. This was Dream Theater's most commercially accessible record, and alot was beacuse of Kevin. I don't think that is a bad thing. I look a Dream Theater as more than just a prog band but as a great band in general. I wish more of the general public were exposed to these guys. I think there is something for any music lover to enjoy here. GREAT ALBUM! A must for any music fan.

1402210086|5.0|******SPOILERS, but nothing unexpected for a Heyer romance***********<br /><br />There is something peculiarly satisfying about this book, in which Heyer puts her usual hero types into the background and brings her usual comic-relief Tulip to the foreground as an unexpected hero.<br /><br />Kind-hearted man-about-town Freddie, who agrees to fake an engagement to his cousin Kitty (previously inaccurately rendered by me as Kate) so that she can enjoy a  month in London (and make the man she really loves jealous), is like Bertie Wooster transported to the Regency era.  Or, at least, everyone who knows him thinks he's Woosterish, including his sardonic father and the dashing object of Kitty's affections.  Both of these men are the sorts of characters Heyer more usually casts as her heroes, and it is in the subverting of the expectations of the genre that Heyer has her triumph in \\"Cotillion.\\"  Freddie isn't stupid.  It's just that he never has much of anything to think about, so he doesn't.  Think, that is.  But when he has a problem to solve, he has the knowledge of his social world and the people in it to draw on in figuring things out.  And he is surprisingly hard to bully.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of \\"Cotillion\\" is that we see exactly why Freddie begins to take his engagement to Kitty seriously, and we see exactly why she comes to appreciate him.  He not only has address; he is steadfast.  Papageno gets his Papagena, and the cotillion of love confirms the Shakespearian dictum that man is a giddy thing.  Indeed, Heyer leads her pairs of lovers through the dance with an almost Shakespearian grace.<br /><br />I will add that my favorite secondary character is Freddie's father, the most suavely sinister and hilariously unflappable parent since Justin, the Duke of Avon.  I sometimes do a mental casting of Heyer's books as movies, and Freddie's father is definitely a Christopher Plummer role.

As soon as I saw the lineup, I said to myself, \\"There's no way I'm going to spend my hard-earned cash in a theatre on this flick.\\"  So, I didn't.  Well, it made the cable channel lineup this week, so I gave it a shot.  I'm glad that I kept my money in my pocket.  Don't get me wrong, it has the following points in it's favor:<br /><br />1. Mr. Goodman make an excellent Pops Racer<br />2. Roger Allam (as usual) make a great over-the-top racing mogul<br /><br />But, that's about all it.  The action was mostly CGI (of course), and it just made me dizzy.  For a Speed Racer purist (like me), the movie ultimately fell flat.  Oh, well...I rate this effort 3 stars...

B000FDECGA|5.0|I am not usually a fan of dubbed versions of Japanese films.  Most of the time, they are so poorly done I don't know why they even bother.  But somehow, I find \\"Shogun Assassin\\" to be not only forgivable, but an awesome flick.<br /><br />Maybe because this is more than just a dubbed version of the original film.  The director, Robert Houston, spliced together the \\"good parts\\" of two films, [[ASIN:B0000B1ODQ Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance]] and [[ASIN:B0000BV20Y Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart at the River Styx]] into a single story.  He then hired deaf lip-readers to help him create an English-language script that was synchronized to the mouth movements, and Mark Lindsay from the band [[ASIN:B00000JGZK Paul Revere & the Raiders]] to lay out a funky synthesizer track for a score.  It reminds me a bit of the animated series [[ASIN:B000B5IOY8 Robotech]] or even Woody Allen's [[ASIN:B00009Q4W7 What's Up, Tiger Lily?]] which both created new stories out of Japanese material.<br /><br />Or maybe it is because \\"Shogun Assassin\\" is just so cool.  The story is a simplified version of the original Lone Wolf and Cub series.  You still have the wandering swordsman with his killer baby, but this time they are only fleeing from \\"The Shogun\\" instead of any complex story of clan rivalry.  They are pursued by endless squads of \\"ninjas\\" which are handily and bloodily dispatched in grand style.  That's about it.  This is definitely the \\"good parts\\" version, and the fun comes from the endless swordfights and syntho soundtrack.<br /><br />The violence here is over the top.  There is one scene where a female ninja proves her prowess by fighting a battle with the Shogun's top fighter, and she slowly slices him to pieces, first fingers, then ears, then feet.  It is a visual demonstration of the famous \\"To the pain\\" scene from The Princess Bride.  All of the scenes go like that.  No sword is drawn but body parts go flying.  Good times indeed.<br /><br />The entire series has been released by Animeigo in the [[ASIN:B001EAWMFQ Shogun Assassin: 5 Film Collector's Set]].  Chances are if you see the first one, you are going to want to see them all.1EAWMFQ Shogun Assassin: 5 Film Collector's Set]].

B00063EMJ6|5.0|The idea of producing a single disc greatest hits package for Neil Young would be tantamount to treason had it been compiled by anyone other than Neil Young himself, and even then we're pushing the envelope folks!  I originally wrote a rather snarky review on this a couple years ago even though I have nothing but good to say about it.  You see, I grew up with Neil Young and had literally everything released on vinyl with his name on it from BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD through THIS NOTES FOR YOU, and on top of that I had pretty much everything (about 95%) of the rest of the collective and solo efforts of his CSNY mates.  So I approached the original review with the perspective of why would anyone, including myself, purchase a &#34;greatest hits&#34; CD of Neil Young?  Ayuh!  That is the question isn't it?  Well, considering the sheer size of all those records packed together, it nearly dwarfed my collective and solo Beatles collection (complete) but not quite.  IF you are of a mind to purchase this CD regardless of what other CD's you have (I have Buffalo Springfield Retrospective, D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, CSN Greatest Hits, Harvest, and Harvest Moon so there are some doubled up tracks here, but not a lot).<br /><br />First of all, the mastering (rather Re-Mastering) is superb.  The tracks are all complete originals, no editing of length in any way shape or form.  And the selection is actually the best you can pile up on 80 minutes' worth of space.<br /><br />This CD accomplishes a few things.  For the novice, it is a terrific sampler of Neil Young's best (some of) material, and will hopefully provide a jettison point for diving in deeper to strange new worlds, especially albums not represented here, like ON THE BEACH, or NEIL YOUNG.  If you would like a more comprehensive set from most of the period covered here, I would recommend DECADE which was purchased by diehard fans just for a few tracks which were never released on full length albums!  And if you ARE a diehard fan, this might satisfy your temporary urges while recompiling a very costly collection.  I have replaced both of the Harvest titles and On The Beach so far, but there are literally more than two dozen more titles I need to replace strictly in the Neil solo category alone (that I had in my collection) and THAT my friends is why a diehard fan would purchase this title!<br /><br />The sound production on this (2004? Has it been that long?) release is really terrific, solid bottoms and highs without clipping, it'll supply a second heartbeat in the car or will fill your living room with static electricity, his guitar will wind around your ankle like a clinging vine.<br /><br />Yes there are titles a-plenty missing from this collection, but until I can afford the whole album, I have at least Amazon mps's to buy and blank discs to fill with Cortez The Killer, Goin' Back, On The Beach, Star Of Bethlehem, Sample & Hold, The Loner, Already One, etc.  and this truly is The Best Fit under 1 Hour and 20 Minutesisfy your temporary urges while recompiling a very costly collection.

B000QXDEDG|4.0|I put off seeing this movie for about two or three years.  I'm a history buff, an am familiar with the record of events at Thermopylae. This homo-erotic hollywood version of the fighting and battle follows the basic story line, and has some historical fact loosely translated into what you see on the screen.  Not a bad message, gets the main point of a handful of Soldiers defiantly challenging an enemy of superior strength.    As long as you don't get too wrapped up in the lack of historical accuracy, such as uniforms, battle gear, historical figures, etc., then you should be fine.  Accept it as a piece of entertainment that loosely tells a story.  Read about the battle of Thermopylae first, or after watching the movie, but know that the movie is a highly dramatized hollywood version of an actual historically important event.

Art doesn't always have to imitate life and, never has it been truer than with this series. It looks and sounds great, at least better than it ever did. One, however, must ask...Did Lionsgate really pull out everything in the arsenal to clear these flicks up ? Probably not, but it still looks the best it ever has. Not a bad deal at less than $25 for the box set. I think I spent more than that on Rambo IV alone.

0143038419|4.0|When I pick up a book, it's generally to be entertained.  I was not expecting a travel memoir or a social commentary; I found a single person's journey through a period of her life and it was exciting to delve into the mind of another individual.      My mother and a co-worker both found her to be \\"whiney\\" and couldn't get past the fact that she seemed not to be able to move-on.  I took into consideration that this was a 9-month period of time and some people take longer to heal.  They were both divorced, and I have not - which colors part of their experience with this book in a way that did not with me.  On the other-hand, my other co-worker, also a divorcee found her to be refreshing and totally relatable.      I did not agree with her spiritual musings, but that's Ok!  I was not reading this book for a spiritual awakening nor looking for a manual.      I found Ms. Gilbert to be hilarious and frazzled and imperfect and searching for a bit of peace and balance.  Yes, I cried - and more than once!  Especially the beautiful dinner in Italy (you'll find out!).    It's worth picking up and trying on.  It may resonate with you, but it especially won't if you expect it to be something more than what it is - a single person's account of THEIR OWN experience during a short time in their life!  And what's experience if not the catalyst to change??

B001DDBCUU|5.0|I have never watched a single episode of Sex and the City. I only wtached this movie because people around me was talking so much about it.  Since haven't seen the series I thought maybe I can watch the movie and see what the fuss is all about.    I'm glad I did because this is a very entertaining movie. Let me say this, you don't even have to be a fan of the show to enjoy it.  The movie explains lot's of stuff about the relations between the characters. I'm not saying everything, but you get the idea.    So colorful and lively, I loved this movie. It's nice to see a romantic movie without comedic twist. The movie feels so natural, I haven't felt a single dull moment.    Fans of the show may have found some flaws, but I'm not. So I can easily recommend the movie to everyone, though because of numerous nude scenes it's not a family movie.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|[[ASIN:B001PPLIEG Quantum of Solace]]<br />Though many die-hard bond fans rate this film as secondary, I would not even dream of doing so. This bond film is shot crisp and delivers the punch. The audio particularly in this DVD is superb. The video is in widescreen format. Craig is definitely in a class of his own. He really looks battered and bruised. The story is a direct continuation of \\"Casino Royale\\". Judi Dench is quite impressive as M. The heart and soul of the film is Giancarlo Giannini's Rene Mathis, the kind of man Bond might be capable of becoming, and one he learns something about himself from. One of their scenes is easily one of the very finest moments in the entire history of the series. The film is also surprisingly vicious - for perhaps the first time in a Bond film, innocent people on the street, are deliberately killed. It may not be a great Bond movie, but it most definitely is a Bond movie. Olga Kurylenko manages to shake off the ineptness of her former films, to be a more than adequate, but not an especially memorable Bond girl. Instead of being just a pretty face, Kurylenko, comes over as a truly original variation on the theme - mysterious, driven, highly capable yet vulnerable too. In Quantum of Solace, Bond is trying to convince M that he is not seeking revenge - he is seeking his quantum of solace, his peace of mind. He needs to know who he can trust, who his friends are. Quantum so Solace, isn't one of the great Bond films, and Casino Royale set the bar far too high for it to compete. But it's certainly not a disappointment if you view it, aware of the fact, and more gratifyingly, the similarities to \\"License to Kill\\" are merely superficial. The running time is never a problem if one understands that, like \\"From Russia with Love\\"; this movie is beautifully edited, throwing out all the overused 'Bondisms' to get down to business. The story sees Bond pursuing the organization he holds responsible for the death of his love Vesper (Eva Green) in Casino Royale. It turns out that this organization, Quantum, still unknown to MI6 is highly powerful and internationally connected and Bond stumbles on its plot to control Bolivia's water supply. It has one of the most relentless and gripping pre-title sequences in Bond history. The film isn't as humorless as some have complained: there's a lot of dry wit where appropriate and a delightfully playful game of cat-and-mouse with Bond and M in a hotel, but none of the outright slapstick comedy that dragged the series down during the 'Roger Moore-days'. Craig still owns the role impressively and Jeffrey Wright starts to come in to his own as Felix Loiter, this time round. All said and done Quantum of Solace is a very enjoyable film. It might not have the suave assuredness of the Connery films, but what it has is Daniel Craig who, and this is coming from a lifelong Connery fan, is hands-down the best Bond of the series next to Sean Connery.asino Royale.

0930289234|5.0|I am not a fan of comic books.  Over the years, I have bought reprints of the few that are considered great, but I do not collect them or anything.  I thought \\"Watchmen\\" was brilliant.  I had never heard of it until last Fall, when the articles about the movie came out.  I decided to take a chance and read the book.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie, but I don't see how it could hold up compared to this brilliant piece of fiction.  The plot is not the main purpose of the series; it is about the characters, the people, and that is where the book shines.  These are REAL people in an alternate world, who choose to dress up in silly costumes and be \\"heroes\\" (until the one real Superhero shows up).<br /><br />The exploration of good and evil, of actions and consequences, of people being lonely and trying to make connections, are all explored.  There are so many layers, it really needs to be read multiple times, to get it all.  These people are not strictly \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\" (as much as Rorschach would like to believe), these are complicated, multi-layered people.<br /><br />For those who have seen the movie:  I don't think it could match the brilliance of the book.  By skipping the entire \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" comic-within-a-comic, the movie misses the amazing parallels the author is drawing.  The biography \\"Under the Hood\\" excerpts, advertisements, police reports, newspaper articles, etc. scattered through the book add to the traditional comic portions.<br /><br />In short:  If you enjoy great fiction, whether or not you read graphic novels, read it!  I just wish I had gotten the larger edition, the pictures are so great and detailed, and the trade edition I got was a bit small.

B000002KMV|5.0|This album was released in the fall of 1981, and basically   exbounds on where it's predecessor, the ground-breaking &   career direction-changing \\"Dirty Mind\\" left off!   At this time, Prince was still fairly unknown to most of   the pop world, but was building quite a cult following between  the lines with a fanbase that was all races, backgrounds and   sexual persuasions. Prince's fans were then ultra-hip blacks,   whites, latinos, gays, bi's, men & women who liked to live   ahead of the curve, and who longed to break free from what had   been established R&B/Funk as well as Pop/Rock.   Prince moves effortlessly between all 4 of these genres   without being defined by any of them...the sure sign of   a true genius..AN ARTIST WHO DEFIES CATEGORY & CONVENTION!!  Not only was this evident in his music by then, but in his image!  Was he black, white, or latino?--Straight, Gay, or Bi?   Why did he strut around in black silky bikini-like underwear   with garter-belts, thigh-high leggings, and high heeled boots on?  What was his music?--Was it rock, pop, funk or R&B?  Why was this peculiar little 5'5\\", sexually ambiguous,   reclusive musical mastermind from the far off and unlikely   city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, who never really bothered   to explain himself to the media, bucking the established way   of being at the time?     (Remember, R&B/Funk was: Earth, Wind & Fire, Parliament/Funkadelic,   The O'Jays, Cameo, Teddy Pendergrass, etc., and Pop/Rock was:   Rod Stewart, Van Halen, The New Wave Movement, etc.)    And why did he possess this dynamic energy and sex appeal   on stage that was selling out mid-sized venues at the time,   and had him upstaging people like Rick James, who was so mad   that Prince had outshined him and made him look like an   irrelevant has-been in the middle of what was supposed to   be his \\"Fire It Up Tour\\" as a headliner, that he fired Prince   from the tour half way through and harbored a bitter grudge   against him for the next 24 yrs!Oh yes, this \\"kid\\" was swirling with building curiousity  and yes, CONTROVERSY!!--And he knew it!   And what's more important, he had the presence of mind   to work it to his advantage...luring his building cult of   listeners and fans deeper into his music!    Having set it all up like that, Prince appropriately   packaged all of this into 1981's sizzling musical melange entitled \\"CONTROVERSY\\"!!  From the pulsing, throbbing opening (no pun intended)   of the title track, which worked his Minneapolis sound   of funky guitar licks & rock power chords against  funky 4/4 beats and pumping basslines accented by then   futuristic-sounding keyboards which he also accented as horns   as well as pads and melody lines!--This was also his first   experiments in what would become a staple in his sound for   the next few years...THE LINN-9000 Drum Machine, Clap Pads   & Syndrums, which he detuned to create all kinds of   weird & disparaging sound textures throughout his work   as well as studio wizardry, all of which created a sound   that was very different then and unique to him!  Then he had the nerve to add THE LORD'S PRAYER in the song   right before a chant of \\"People Call Me Rude, I Wish We All   Were Nude!--I Wish There Was No Black & White, I Wish There   Were No Rules!\\" LOL!!--WHAT??--OMG!!   The reactionary religious right and Catholic diocese  went off!---Drawing yet more attention to Prince   and his extraordinary artistry!  This was still 2 or 3 yrs before Madonna would emerge   and make this an artform in itself!  (-:    Track 2, \\"SEXUALITY\\" was a punk/new wave vibe over a   weird, sparse but funky drum/percussion workout that   was a call to arms to a still pre-aids generation of   20-something baby boomers and \\"the new breed\\" as Prince   called it, of young emerging Gen-Xers (my generation!)   who were still caught in the final writhing throws of  the sexual revolution! He told us to \\"STAND UP, ORGANIZE!!\\"  And man, did we ever! (-:   It was all about being free then!  Track 3 is one of the first of what would become another   staple of his future albums...The slow, sexy, sinewy,   lush, lude & explicit love ballads!  \\"DO ME BABY\\" was an instant classic on black radio   \\"quiet storms\\" and still is a true fan favorite to this day!   This song caused a slight swell in minority births of babies   concieved in late 1981 and early 1982, who were born   in '82 and '83!!--(Yep, Prince is kinda your daddy!)  Basically, this track is a sexual interlude set to music!  He even simulates orgasm on this one, which was shocking   & titillating to his listeners back then..  ending with a cryptic interlude that ends in a doomful-sounding   bell toll..maybe saying his own weird but prophetic Prince   way that the loose & free times of the sexual revolution   were about to come to a screeching halt with the sudden   appearance of the spectre of the AIDS PANDEMIC!!  This was 1981, remember?    Track 4 opens with the electronic fanfare and syndrums   of \\"PRIVATE JOY\\", which is an overlooked and underrated   Prince classic from days gone by!  This song basically speaks of obsession/possession   of a young man who will \\"Strangle Valentino!\\" to make sure   that the apple of his eye stays his   \\"Pretty Toy & Private Joy\\" exclusively!  It's coda fades into what sounds-like the resurrection   of Jimi Hendrix with it's guitar feedback, apocalyptic drones,   rapid-fire snares that sound like machine gunfire,   then Prince lets out a loud bone-chilling scream  and suddenly it's the rock/punk/new wavey \\"RONNIE TALK 2 RUSSIA\\"   which captures the times of a then new republican regime   with Ronald Reagan at the helm, bargaining with the still   cold war era communist Russia and China, who were ever solid   in their stand against democracy!  Prince warns \\"Ronnie\\" in a prophetic tone   not to \\"feed the left wing guerillas\\" who want to   blow up the world!--(Boy, did that one come to pass!)  America would one day be attacked by the very countries   whothey stupidly helped to arm with bombs, guns, planes   and other \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" back in the   late 70's and early 80's, when the powers that be   thought that it was going to give them leverage  against the enemies of democracy!--DOH!!  After this short but peppy track, comes one of the   funkiest, slamminest, but nearly forgotten today Prince jams...  the rollicking \\"LET'S WORK\\", in which Prince mixes his   favorite brew of dance, music, sex & romance!  It is 3 minutes and 57 seconds of pure funky perfection   and was a staple on the turntables of all the hippest   house parties and clubs in the 'hoods and underground   establishments of America at the time!  There was a mean 12\\" extended version of this too that was hot!  Then abruptly, as to signify that the party was fleeting,   Prince signals the chimes with bizarre synth flourishes   that take us into the spooky mind of an anti-christ   serial-killer spirit-figure who he accredits all the   worlds woes of the time, including the Atlanta Child Murders,   the senseless & cold-blooded murder of much beloved   ex-Beatle & peace activist John Lennon, and the political   double-dealing shenanigans of Oliver North & Company in ABSCAM!!   (look it up, if you ain't hip!)  He calls this spectre \\"ANNIE CHRISTIAN\\" and vows to   live his life in taxi cabs until she's crucified!     Nobody got it at the time, but looking back, this was   quite a prophetic album. It ends on a slightly comedic   and naughty rebellious note with the old-school   Elvis-like rock-n-roll-a-billy of Prince's  ode to mutual shall we say, STIMULATION??  \\"JACK U OFF\\" which closes the album out with a bang!  He would again use that retro-rock-a-billy style on his  charted pop single \\"Delirous\\" from the follow-up to this   album..his pop music breakthrough...  1982's futuristic masterpiece \\"1999\\"!  **(Check out my review on that one!)**  It proves just how far out ahead of the pack that   Prince was in terms of music, ideology, style andeverything else!  But then, true geniuses always are, right?  This young man, then just 23 yrs old, had already mastered   40 instruments, could run a studio basically by himself,   set a concert arena on fire with his cutting edge performances,  and was the mastermind behind a then burgeoning musical   jugernaut which would dominate the latter part of the 80's   musicscape and inspire us beyond, deserves the title of   innovator and musical genius because quite simply, HE WAS!!  Today, when music is so lacking in conviction, ambition,   creativity or even TALENT for that matter, it makes me   cringe everytime somebody (a so-called artist) is allowed   through the iron curtain of corporate pop BS, who is a   little quirky or doing something a little less mediocre   than the mediocrity that is accepted as music today,   are automatically bestowed with the title of   GENIUS & INSTANT ICON!!--Arrrgh!--I hate that!  Prince (the heir apparent) is the last of a breed of   artistic giants who walked the earth from the mid 50's   to the mid 70's, who basically created the musical pallet   that we know as modern music today!   You can see them all in his body of work...  The flamboyance, flash and sexual ambiguity of   Little Richard, Elvis & David Bowie...  The funky power and stage persona of James Brown,   The free-flowing eclectic funk/rock/pop/soul of Hendrix,   Sly Stone, P-Funk, Larry Graham, Curtis Mayfield,   Stevie Wonder and others, coupled with the   folk/rock sensibilties of Joni Mitchell & Bob Dylan   to the balls out classic rock of Zepplin, Sabbath,   Grand Funk Railroad, etc.!!--Yes, it's all there!  30 yrs of musical history packed in one diminuitive   but powerful and extraordinary human being named   Prince Rogers Nelson!  You cannot go wrong with this guy from his debut   of 1978's \\"FOR YOU\\" to 1987's \\"SIGN 'O THE TIMES\\"!!   These were the musical bricks in which he built his   reputation and amazing body of work that made him the   last true innovatorto come along and change the   game around to HIS DIRECTION and landed him  a much deserved place in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame!!

B001TH16DS|3.0|There's good news, and bad news, for Trekkies these days.    The bad news is that people WILL probably buy the new $80 First Season/TOS.      The good news is, there's a much more interesting alternative.    Why \\"bad news\\"?  These episodes from the 1960's were NOT meant to be seen in a \\"hi-def\\" format.  You can see the fake pointy ears, and all sorts of bad make-up tricks, for example.  I actually enjoyed the poor UHF quality I first saw in the 1970's re-broadcasts more, for their fuzziness and wild colors.    The \\"good news\\"?  If you can afford it, the new Samsung flat-screens will amaze you, when you pop in a regular DVD of Star Trek/TOS.  This TV refreshes the image 124 times a second, instead of just 24 times a second, producing a freakish, creepy clarity and unnerving, startling fluidity of movement in these old episodes, which you probably have completely memorized by now on (what will soon seem like) a much more stilted, halting TV image.  The characters, the actors, will seem to begin to stroll right off the screen, and into your living rooms.  It is, quite simply, breath-taking.    But, of course, buying a new flatscreen is more or less out of the question these days, for 99.99% of the population.  But trust me, it is AMAZING, to see TOS truly come alive like this.

6305971935|1.0|A little disappointing when compared with my memory of first seeing it on its original release, but this is only because the special effects and concept are now somewhat dated.  However, it was still good to see Michael Pare oozing wartime sex appeal in a modern day society, one of the attractions of the plot.  The warship-trapped-in-time concept was less thrilling than the original, but has stood the test of time for younger viewers without the sophisticated taste of higher tech expectations.  A good watch for say a 10 year old but not that intriguing for adults. Worth a look though, for old times sake, after giving it to your nephew for christmas.

The footnotes were wonderful and almost a story in themselves. But I'd like to add my own footnote to the authors: \\"Seems to me,\\" to use the words of Adam the Antichrist, that those maggots were gross and unnecessary and over-the-top, Neil & Terry!

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|My wife and I had the privilege of seeing Leonard in concert here in Phoenix on April 5.  The performance was quite possibly the best I've seen in more than 40 years of attending concerts, and it was nearly identical to the London concert captured on this DVD.  As a result, we now have a wonderful reminder of the superb show we saw.  But for those unable to attend the live show, this DVD is the next best thing to being there.  Still, if you can be there, don't pass up the opportunity to see this extraordinary man, his musicians and his backup singers - it is well worth the cost.    Others have commented on the quality of the other performers, and I can't really add much here, other than to echo those sentiments - they are all world class.  A few of them probably deserve special mention, though.  Sharon Robinson's vocals on a couple of songs she co-wrote - \\"In My Secret Life\\" and \\"Boogie Street\\" - are among the concert highlights.  And the Webb Sisters' version of \\"If It Be Your Will\\" is nothing short of breathtaking.  Javier Mas does some sensational work on various forms of the acoustic guitar.    Most likely, everyone reading this is already a Leonard Cohen fan (disciple?), so remarks about his brilliance and the impact his work has on people probably all go without saying.  Instead, I will just say that all of that shines through in this DVD, and every Leonard Cohen fan should have a copy.    Some reviews here mention disappointment with the sound, but our experience has been entirely positive.  We did find that some adjustments to our system settings were necessary in order to get the most of out of it, but once we did that, it was just like being back at the Dodge Theater on April 5.

006085880X|4.0|The Hartes and the Golds had been neighbours and best friends for 18 years. So it was no surprise that their children, Emily Gold, a talented young artist, and Chris Harte, a bright, motivated athlete and the star of his high school swimming team, would also grow up as inseparable best friends. Emily and Chris, born only scant weeks apart, bonded even as infants and grew up as close together as two non-siblings possibly could be. What Emily knew, Chris also knew and understood. When Chris was hurting, Emily also suffered and shared his pain. What Emily experienced, Chris also felt with a powerful bond of empathy that approached the strength of the almost surreal attachment that fraternal twins feel for one another. It came as no surprise to their parents, their teachers and their friends that their attachment, in the fullness of time, blossomed into a more mature romantic love that everyone around them fully expected would end in their eventual marriage to one another.<br /><br />Emily told nobody, however, of the difficulties that she was encountering in dealing with the newer sexual side of her relationship with Chris. Perhaps it was the simple stress of living up to everybody's expectations of the future of their relationship. Perhaps it was the residual psychological stress of a close experience with sexual assault and rape when she was a much younger girl. Perhaps it was her disturbing sensation that sex with Chris was rather too akin to an incestuous relationship with a brother. Stress, confusion and mental turmoil lead to profound depression and despair with the conviction that the only escape was suicide. Of course, because Chris was the only person she felt she truly loved and could completely trust, she asked him to help her complete the act of suicide.<br /><br />Any potential readers that are tempted to give vent to a storm of righteous indignation at my summary should sit back down, relax and be assured that I haven't given the game away here. The suicide itself takes place in the opening chapter and the underlying causes as I've summarized them likewise come as no surprise and are detailed very early in the story.<br /><br />Fans of Jodi Picoult's novels will understand immediately that the mere details of this story are NOT the raison d'être for the novel. The story serves only as a backdrop for the exploration of the complexity of the surrounding issues - teen suicide; the responsibility of parents, teachers and peers to recognize the signs of depression and to act upon the near occasion of suicide; the moral difficulties of assisted suicide; the nature of friendship; the stress exerted by parental, teacher and peer pressure; and the difficulties encountered by the survivors of a suicide.<br /><br />Having said that the story itself was not really top billing in the novel, I have to give Picoult full credit for her marvelous portrayal of some absolutely electric courtroom scenes and Chris Harte's trial for capital murder. The description of his time spent in prison and the relationship that he develops with his cell-mate is absolutely heartbreaking and certainly qualifies as first-rate storytelling. On the other hand, my impression of \\"The Pact\\" overall is that it is considerably weaker than some of Picoult's other efforts such as \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" or \\"Nineteen Minutes\\". Some rather lame dialogue, an overly lengthy exposition in the central part of the novel and my personal difficulty in believing that Chris Harte would have chosen to deal with the issue entirely on his own detract from the overall effect of the novel.<br /><br />But, make no mistake, a poor day with a Jodi Picoult novel is still a very sunny day in a literary world clouded with sub-standard choices. I'm a confirmed fan. Now that I've found her work, I'm looking for another one to read post haste.<br /><br />Paul Weissplace in the opening chapter and the underlying causes as I've summarized them likewise come as no surprise and are detailed very early in the story.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Whether you're a fan or not this is one incredible package of movies and extras.  First of all, I have to tell you that I absolutely loved the original \\"Matrix\\".  It was everything a movie should be...and more.  The other two could not compete and were seen as lessor movies because of it.  But the mythology stayed strong and the effects remained remarkable.  The Blu-ray version (especially with animatrix)is outstanding.  You can always fast forward through the \\"orgy\\" scenes in MAtrix II if you like but otherwise, definitely worth having.
B000002UAR|5.0|During the early months of 1966, the Beatles decided to abandon touring after their August U.S. Dates.<br />The next stage of their studio evolution was to begin writing songs that would be more than two guitars-bass & drums pop singles.<br /><br />To achieve some of the sounds on what became their 7th album \\"Revolver\\", the Beatles' production team would create several recording techniques that are still in use today, including auto-double-tracking, processing voices, guitars and other instrumentation through a Leslie speaker, and arguably, the first use of \\"sampling\\" with multiple tape loops.<br />John,Paul & George wrote more challenging pieces to match the creative atmosphere.<br /><br />  The Tracks:<br /><br />George Harrison contributed an incredible 3 songs to the album.<br />\\"Taxman\\" opens the album, a rocking track that laments the British taxpayer's plight.<br />In an interesting role reversal, George lays out the bass line, and Paul the guitar solo.<br /><br />George's 2nd offering, \\"Love You To\\" is a meeting of east and west.<br />George provide double-tracked sitar and vocal, as well as stabs of fuzzed electric guitar.<br />Indian musician Anil Baghwat provides the tabla accompaniment.<br /><br />George's 3rd song, \\"I Want To Tell You\\", is his most straight-forward featuring a recurring guitar hook and a honky-tonk piano.<br />The unusual 'E add F' chord in the verses, and the augmented chord in the bridge spices the song up nicely.<br /><br />Paul's songs cross over several styles:<br /><br />\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" an anthem about isolation, has no Beatles instrumentation at all - just 2 Paul vocals, George & John backing,and a string section impeccably scored by George Martin.<br />The effect is haunting.<br /><br />\\"Here, There & Everywhere\\" is Paul's quintessential love ballad.<br />A sweet lead vocal, glorious 'oohs' behind it, and no nonsense.<br /><br />\\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is the Beatles version of what is called \\"bubble gum\\". Simple as that.<br /><br />\\"For No One\\" is Paul McCartney meets Johann S. Bach.<br />The clavichord has almost a chamber or baroque sound, and when combined with horn player Alan Civil's solo breaks, the song has a very\\"English\\" feel.<br /><br />Paul's last song \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\", has all the brassiness of any 1960's Motown tune, but the guitars at the end remind you whose rocking the house.<br />Imagine the surprise of many when Paul admitted the lyrics were \\"an ode to pot\\".<br /><br />John's contributions were also influenced by an illicit substance: LSD.<br />\\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" moves along at a medium groove, as John sounds half asleep singing, and Paul yawns for good measure.<br />The gem here is George's backwards guitar solos-a first. Psychedelia has begun.<br /><br />\\"She Said She Said\\" is a 3-Beatle performance, with Paul not involved.<br />George cranks his Gibson SG into high gear for this and lays down a neat bass line as well, while John relates a story that Peter Fonda told him about knowing death.<br /><br />If I had to make a short list of underrated Beatles songs,\\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" would top that list.<br /> Paul & Ringo lay a solid foundation upon which George & John lay down perfectly synchronized dual lead guitars. A rock & roll masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Dr. Robert\\" about a pill-pushing doctor is another straight forward rocker, except for the \\"dreamlike well-well-well section\\"<br /><br />John's final song \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" utilizes every recording trick I mentioned at the top of this review.<br />The stories are legend of how everybody all around Abbey Road studios held a spool of looped tape threaded onto every tape machine in the building and were fed back into the recording desk, where engineer Geoff Emerick lifted and lowered faders at random in a one-time only live mix. Astounding.<br />Finally, after all that heavy technological wizardry, the album's biggest hit is a Ringo vocal; the infectuous sing-along \\"Yellow Submarine\\", which went to # 1in the fall of 1966.<br /><br />There you have it: Aside from \\"Abbey Road\\", this would be the Beatles' finest work.<br />One of the top- 10 best albums ever.
B0000457HB|4.0|This set provides a complete selection of BW. Unfortunately the audio quality is lacking. Needs to be remastered.
B0000028VT|4.0|Music Box is Mariah Carey's best-selling album, and it's easy to see why. It includes some of her best-loved hits, then and now. \\"Dreamlover\\" is a breezy, mid-tempo track that ranks among Mariah's greatest material, thanks in part to its breathy harmonies and an enthusiastic Hammond B-3 organ performance from Walter Afanasieff. \\"Anytime You Need a Friend\\" is an excellent gospel-tinged number with a powerful back-up choir. The title track is a slow-burn, R&B-inspired song with a beautifully subdued vocal. Perhaps the most famous track, \\"Hero\\" doesn't quite measure up to the other songs. A heavily-produced big ballad with encouraging lyrics, it has become Mariah's signature song. While it's undeniably schmaltzy and a bit contrived, she sings with conviction. On Music Box, Mariah Carey showed considerable growth as a songwriter and as a producer. The vocal arrangements on every track are impeccable; after listening to this record for years, I'm still finding new harmony parts I didn't recognize before. By toning down the histrionics, Mariah comes across as a better singer who is more invested in the material. Music Box is the epitome of polished pop, and it fits her voice perfectly. 4 Stars.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Classic Bill Murray.  The guy NEVER fails to deliver a great performance and this is no exception.  Set in PA on (you guessed it) GROUNDHOG DAY!!!    Phil (not the groundhog LOL) is sent to cover this event and is sent in what seems to be a never ending cycle of the same day OVER AND OVER.  While if you've ever went to nitpickers website there are questions I'd ask as things don't fit.  HOWEVER this does NOT take away from a great movie with a lot of fun in it.  I would highly suggest seeing this if not buying it.
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|An engrossing experience until about the last third - then the slow moving film slows to a crawl with tedious, unnecessary \\"back story\\" business and too much concentration on characters added to ensure gender equity.<br />So the doomed, distasteful affair between an underage boy and a hardened woman \\"with a Past\\" (that's for sure) comes to its' harrowing conclusion...and they both move on. She moves up the ranks in her Civil service job and he graduates Law School. While there, he attends a real trial involving former Nazi Concentration Camp guards...wait a minute, it can't be? Hanna?<br />He is horrified but becomes obsessed with the case. His not unpleasant memories of his youthful indiscretion combine with his intellectual bent and he agonizes...recalls how he played \\"reader\\" for her during their interludes. This begins many years of secret communiques involving the original material.<br />Of course, she's not innocent. But maybe...she's not *as guilty* as the others because..she was actually...illiterate. The audience is supposed to decide if \\"orders\\" have to be written to be understood. Yeah, she signed away her life and the lives of others. I guess when she selected victims for slaughter she assumed they were not headed for such a situation.<br />Voyeuristic direction of the \\"Michael\\" character (at age 15) makes one wonder about the true message of this movie. (Win at Cannes!?)

It truly keeps you captivated and intrigued.  you look forward and cant wait for week to end and sunday night to roll around to see the next episode. The dark comedy and drama is like no other. Bryan Cranston is brilliant and Aaron Paul Is a great actor allso he realy plays the part quite well you actually route for him time to time. Any way I will be buying the first and second season just to show people who have not seen it.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|Those who have come to Scream expecting (despite foreknowledge of Timbaland's involvement) straight-up rock are...well, screaming over Chris Cornell's latest effort. No, this is definitely not the usual Chris Cornell rock album. If you can strip away your expectations, as well as your attachment to the past or to any prejudices you might have regarding musical style - in other words, listen with an open mind - you will experience a tremendously satisfying, genre-bending musical feast. This is the Chris Cornell we love - only in a new, richly layered, inventively melodic guise. Brilliant as always.

1596434252|5.0|The author/artist created an absolutely stunning, amazing, and functional work of art. My librarian sister gave this to my almost 4 year son and we LOVE to peruse the pages time and time again. We just can't get enough of the cool \\"animations\\"! I frequently find myself \\"reading\\" the book even without my son.     I would caution against young readers reading the book independently as the letters are delicate and my son (as an average 3-4 year old does) has a tendency to treat it as casually as any of his other books, despite his best efforts to read it gently. Mishandling or constantly touching the letters could potentially damage the letters and cause them to lose their 3D effect. To prevent this, I make sure that we read it together or that I supervise him while he's reading it.     In general, it is a book that ALL ages can appreciate and enjoy. I foresee this becoming a classic!
B000NVL9KG|5.0|I bought the LP ages ago and recently purchased the CD.  Tarkus is truly a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. I can't add much to what other reviewers have already stated. The way EL&P blend several songs into a unified 20 minute theme is sheer genius. Don't miss this one. The other songs are pretty good too, especially Jeremy Bender and The Only Way.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This is a great TV series, full of wit and never-ending fun, but with some serious heart as well. Season one is the best, and definitely worth the money I spent on it, which means a lot coming from a college student with limited funds!  The price was fair and the delivery quick: it came two days before a similar product I ordered at the same time through another store, which made me very happy.  You'll fall in love with Veronica Mars, and soon you'll realize that she's smarter than you, too, and I don't mean that as an insult!

B001JNNDEW|5.0|Most of the money I spend on Blu Rays is dedicated to movies that are more likely to take advantage of the format.  Movies that are action-packed or just visually epic get most of my blu ray money.  To be completely honest though, Office Space on Blu Ray has shown me that sometimes comedies are also a necessity on blu ray.  Office Space looks as good as it ever has on the format.  Since getting it, I have already watched it at least 6 times in awe of the differences between the blu-ray version and my old dvd copy.

0439023483|5.0|This book amazed me.  I kept putting off reading it, but when I finally picked it up I could not put it down.  I ended up reading the book in a day in a half, I tried to put it down at 2am when I needed to be up the next morning at 6, laid there for 30 minutes thinking about what dear Katniss was going to do next, and decided to just get up and finish the book.  Even though I went to school to teach a classroom full of 7th graders the next morning, it was totally worth it.  I recommend this book for all ages, and both sexes. Boys will like Hunger Games too! Even though my favorite aspect was the love story, it by no means dominated the book.  LOVED IT!

B001SN78JO|2.0|This trite, insipid waste of time has a number of moments worth following: Those surrounding the cult that Carey finds himself involved in (not the Carey's typically overdone, poorly written, poorly controlled character itself) give a few chuckles, and the female lead shines with a well-written, though still outlandish, and played in something close enough to a nuanced manner to shine next to the washed out and repetitive Carey character. The main character is essentially a rehash of the family friendly Carey from Liar Liar et al, but has a handful of adequately morally questionable moments to make the viewer wonder why he couldn't bring something a bit darker and different to bear.<br /><br />This film might be worth watching as the second or third movie on a long flight, as it was for me, but I'm extremely glad I didn't spend money on this film.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The dvd's were used - but packaged like new.  The delivery was speedier then expected and I was very impressed by the seller's inventory.  I will definitely by from them again.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|I was very dissappointed by this movie due to the action sequences being extremely jerky and impossible to follow. The effects may have been great, but you wouldn't know it because the camera appears to be hand held and jerked all over the place to the extent that you can not figure out what is happening. All it does is convey movement and make you nauseous.

And she has a boyfriend who is perfect.  But as wonderful as Mia's life is, she has choices to make.  Should she go to Julliard and leave everyone behind?<br /><br />When a terrible accident occurs, Mia suddenly finds herself with only one choice left - should she stay?<br /><br />This book is just WOW!  Do not read this in public because this one will bring tears to your eyes - I'm warning you! That doesn't mean it doesn't have humor though, because there were many times I found myself laughing out loud. This is an intense story that will not only appeal to teens, but have a lot of crossover adult appeal, as well.<br /><br />Gayle Forman does an excellent job going from Mia's present to Mia's past and drawing the reader in so they truly understand her love for the cello, her family, and Adam, her boyfriend. As I was reading, I felt like I really got to know Mia and her family and found myself grieving along with Mia - the writing is just that powerful.<br /><br />IF I STAY is a short read, but it packs so much in and I wanted to savor every moment. At times I found myself reading slower and drinking in the words because I didn't want the story to end.<br /><br />The story centers around music: Mia with her cello, Adam with his band, and Mia's dad being a drummer, and Gayle Forman's writing felt lyrical. She was able to capture music and put it into a book. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like I was reading a song - hopefully that makes sense!  Music is such an important part of the book, Gayle Forman has included a playlist for the book on her website.  I loved checking out the songs that went along with the story and listening to them when Mia did.<br /><br />IF I STAY is a must-read.  The themes of love, loss, grief, and hope are so powerful and beautifully written that this story will stay with you long after you finish the last page.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Sarah Bean the Green Bean Teen Queenge.

B00127RAJY|4.0|Definitely a workout DVD. I'd like to think I'm in decent shape but this had me still feeling the burn two days later!!  I love that it has different workout options to do over time.  I've used it a couple times but friends have used it for a longer period of time and lost significant weight (which is why I bought it!).  Easy to use.  And...you'll feel the burn!
B0009NCQJ6|4.0|This is a great cd!  The music is upbeat and fun...I found this band when I began getting interested in the electric violin.  What's also great about this is that on the reverse side of the cd is a dvd with 3 or 4 of their videos.  I only wish there were more songs on it!<br /><br />Since this is an instrumental band, none of the songs have any singing (only digitally added voices at some points).  These ladies are so talented!  I would definitely recommend this.
0316017922|1.0|I like Malcolm, I really do. However I can not endorse with clear conscience his recent book. This book is fraught with incomplete and sometimes downright inaccurate statistics that are made up to make the point that Malcolm is trying to make (see some examples below).<br /><br />I think the fundamental problem is as follows; Malcolm's intended audience for this book were public policy makers but most of his readers are the general public. Malcolm wants to convince policy makers that by providing opportunities for all of our population, we can create a nation of more successful people and hence a more successful nation -- a fine thesis that no one in their right mind will disagree. Problem starts in the book when he starts to make up statistics to make his point repeatedly.  Additionally while he is addressing the policy makers on why equal opportunity is important for higher rates of success, he forgets that most of his readers are going to be general public. As a result his book is giving a bad advice to the general public that right opportunities and not their efforts are responsible for their success in life.<br /><br />Problem 1 with the book:  bad journalism and false statistics to support writer's arguments: Malcolm expounds a theory that in computer /software industry wild success is primarily based on when you were born and if you were not born within some magic years which put you at the right age when computer industry took off then you are out of luck. To support his theory he repeatedly gives examples of well known computer industry success stories like Bill Gates, Bill Joy. Afterwards he claims that no one became a billionaire in software industry if they were born outside those magic years within 9 years of Bill Gates birth date. If you were not engaged in software industry you will probably believe him as well. However for anyone remotely in tune with software industry will notice obvious misses of Google's Larry Page, Sergey Brim, or Facebook's Mark Zukerberg or Netscape's Mark Andreesen or  Skype's Ahti Heinla, Kazaa's Niklas Zenntrom and the list goes on and on. This was a prime example of lying with statistics that we hope our journalists and educators avoid at all costs. For the untrained minds this is the most pernicious lies as they are supported with numbers.<br /><br />Malcolm was using his statistics to make a point that external factors play a determining role in our success. While his secondary point that in addition of being born at the right time, you must have had 10,000 hours of computer programming training by the late 70s to be well at the right time and in the right place with the right training. His argument about 10,000 hours of training to become an expert in any field is well supported by third party research. However neither one of his points take into account the personal ambition, motivation, vision, resolve and doggedness that successful people showed to make it big. After all hundreds of other kids were born in those same years and had similar amount of training in computer programming but for some reason only two names really stood out.<br /><br />While I can forgive the mistake of not emphasizing the importance of personal ambition and effort but I can not endorse a successful writer massaging statistical data to make a point. If data does not directly support our thesis then it is our responsibility to either propose theory as our opinion, conjecture or a theory as opposed to a statistical truth that conveniently avoids accounting for counterpoints to our opinion.<br /><br />Problem 2: Bad Messaging:<br /><br />It is writer's job to judge and speak to his audience and talk in an appropriate language to get the right message across. In the process writer is supposed to bring peer reviewed research, his own opinions or his strong convincing power to put across his points. However is writer misjudges who is his audience he stands the risk of speaking to the unintended audience. In the best case that makes his writing ineffective but in the worst case it can actually give the unintended wrong message to the unintended audience.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, this book was intended for public policy makers to convince them the importance of policies like `no child left behind'.  To make his point Malcolm obviously had to convey the point that external factors that can be affected by good public policy are determining factors for success of individuals. However as majority of the readers of outliers are general public, the message real message that is being taken away from the book is that individual effort is not the determining factor of individual success and person has to depend on external factors for their ultimate success.<br /><br />Needless to say that a good reader will not take the messages as negatively as I mentioned above but I state them more strongly than probably warranted to ensure that reader is warned.<br /><br />I will be writing more about this on my site shadman.com.e best case that makes his writing ineffective but in the worst case it can actually give the unintended wrong message to the unintended audience.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, this book was intended for public policy makers to convince them the importance of policies like `no child left behind'.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|This isn't a CD review as much as it is an affirmation of the incredible job that Brendan O'Brien did in re-mixing \\"Ten.\\"  We all know that this piece of music which introduced the world to Pearl Jam is a masterwork. Hell, the fact that Evenflow, Alive, and Jeremy were produced on the  same CD is proof of that.  However, what I really want people to listen to in this collection is O'Brien's remix. Compare for yourself. Listen to the original first and then put on O'Brien's treatment. If you can't hear a staggering difference, then it's your loss. I have never heard such clarity at such volume in a mix in my life. My collection of CD's stands at about 4,000 right now and I have owned and listened to well over 10,000 releases in my lifetime. Nothing compares to the sonic feast that O'Brien's remix gives you in this release. Really, do yourself a favor and listen to this at high volume and see what it reveals to you.
B000RG1FMO|2.0|I bought this because I bought 808's and heartbreak and loved it!  but was extremely dissapointed when i bought this  His flow and lyrics are just garbage for the most part  there are a few good songs    Homecoming- a flawless song  Good Life- wouldve been good but got outplayed on the radio  Drunk and hot girls- love the hook but then it gets boring  Barry Bonds- decent...  Stronger- i guess...    and thats about it, i cant even remember any more songs off that album  I suggest you buy 808's and heartbreak
0790729350|5.0|I love this movie for many reasons and I've reviewed it on the 40th anniversary collector's edition page if you want to see what i think of it. BUT i have a question that i wonder if anyone can help me with because it's been driving me crazy for the LONGEST time:    In the director's cut, the Sly & The Family Stone scene shows a good deal of the song \\"Higher\\" coupled with the song \\"Music Lover\\" as a medley. You don't hear much of \\"Dance to the Music\\" on the dvd.   On both the original soundtrack album and the collector's edition cd box set, the song is presented as \\"Medley: Dance to the Music/Music Lover/Higher.\\" Which is pretty much what it is.   EXCEPT, on both albums, it leaves out most of \\"Higher\\" (except for Sly's little speech about singing along and the \\"higher!\\" call+response w/ the audience). Most of the actual SONG, however, is omitted.     I am 1) wondering the reason for this. did they cut it out of the song on the albums or did they cut together two entirely different parts of the performance in the movie?  and more importantly....2) wondering how can i get my hands on the recording of that missing part of the performance?? it's one of my favorite parts of the show!    if anyone can help me, that'd be great! thanks!

B000077VOY|5.0|There are better reviews than mine to read. But you have got to see this show. From the moment the action packed theme song hits (which you'll soon want to play very loudly) to the end of each episode, your interest will be more than held. In a commentary by Gerry Anderson he mentions he doesn't like the Atlanta puppet. I don't know why he said that. Personally I think she looks hot. And Marina the beautiful mute sea woman will definately tug at your heartstrings. There's even a moment in the second episode that's very emotional where Marina is believed to be an assassin. Thunderbirds may have been a bigger commercial success, but compared to Stingray it's really quite boring. With most sellers selling this set for astoundingly low prices you should really take the chance and order it. There's a lot more to this show than I described, but I figure since other reviews give more detail why repeat them. 39 episodes in all.
B0009X7664|5.0|I was very excited to finally add this movie to my collection. Before I watched the movie again, I watched all (~3 hours) of the bonus disc about Mr. Peck, his family, the making of the movie, etc. How fascinating it was. Then I watched the movie with more interest. It was a very enjoyable long afternoon. Do yourself a favor, get away from all the violence and bad language on tv of these days and put in this movie. It is a very special event.

B001QWQJ4M|3.0|Two years after audiences made a surprise hit out of \\"The Fast and the Furious\\", Universal Pictures released the speed-injected sequel \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\". Gone were most members of the original film's cast, except for Paul Walker who opted to return once again as Brian O'Connor, and joining him this time would be then-newcomer to the acting world Tyrese Gibson (\\"Four Brothers\\"), Eva Mendes (\\"Ghost Rider\\"), and Cole Hauser (\\"Pitch Black\\"), along with director John Singleton (\\"Shaft\\") filling up the director's chair in place of Rob Cohen.    \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" finds Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), now an ex-cop, living a life in hiding, yet still trying to prove just how fast he is in the world of street racing. But when the FBI catches up with Brian, he is given one final chance to do what is right by using his skills behind the wheel to assist in bringing down an international drug lord (Cole Hauser), or face the next few years behind bars. To do this Brian must enlist the aid of a former buddy (Tyrese Gibson) who is just as addicted to the rush of high velocities as he is, and hope that their combined racing prowess will be enough to get the job done before time runs out.    With the original film, \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" audiences were given a movie that no one really had high expectations for, and in the end it became a massive hit for the summer of 2001. For \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" expectations were notably higher going in due to the great success of the original, but only having Paul Walker return for the sequel didn't seem to spell good things for this installment's future, at least not in my book. As it turns out I was wrong in my estimation that the missing element of Vin Diesel and most of the other cast members from the original would effect box office take, because \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" easily drove past where its predecessor finally parked on the box office tally sheet.    The original film was essentially a story about loyalty between friends that live their lives on opposing sides of the law (as it turns out); for the sequel writers Michael Brandt & Derek Haas (\\"Wanted\\") along with original writer Gary Scott Thompson tried to take that initial theme and expound upon it. The main thrust of this film rests upon the decisions Brian made over the course of \\"The Fast and the Furious\\", and how those decisions for better or worse have affected his life today. By taking this route, not only do the writers actually enrich the story for the first movie by adding some new layers after the fact to Brian's character, but also strengthening this film by linking it directly into the action of the original (something that many franchises forget to do, and at times causes a movie within a series to feel unrelated in a way that is detrimental to the franchise). I did enjoy how the story gave us insight into Brian's and Roman's (Tyrese Gibson) history, and made their relationship in this film a parallel to Brian and Dom in the original. It was also interesting to see a different side to Brian's character than we have before. In the first movie he was a cop, so he was bound by the law (to an extent); in this film, no such restriction is in place, and Brian is much more care-free and most likely being himself, thus making him a little more interesting as a character.    As strengthened as the film was by its link to the original, it was also hurt by it because it forced the inevitable comparisons between the two films to come even more naturally. The script for this film did have some weaknesses that detracted from the end result, some of which were problems in the first movie, just not to the extent that they are here. Numerous times throughout the movie the dialogue began to grow tiresome, especially the pervasive uses of the words \\"Yo\\", \\"Bro\\", and \\"Check it\\", all of which seemed to find its way into almost every single moment of Paul Walker's screen time. I know that in the first movie he used these words, and that it kind of solidifiedhis surfer image; however, when it begins to become noticeable to the point that it's annoying, something has gone wrong. Along with that problem there were also several moments within the story that felt slow, as if the writers weren't really sure how to propel the story forward in an interesting way. It was at these times that the movie seemed to be meandering about aimlessly just waiting for the next action/racing sequence to begin so that the story could find its mojo once more. It was due to these problems, and a few other minor ones along the way, that caused \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" to stumble along in places, and in the end fall short of the standard set by the first film.    A staple of this series is of course the racing sequences, and there are a plethora of such scenes in this installment, all of which are fun to watch no doubt about that. Yet, the problem with a franchise such as this, or any action series for that matter, is that it becomes harder in the sequels to make the action (in this case racing) seem fresh and original. No matter how hard you try the racing is going to resemble that which came before it, unless you explore a new style of racing or just go completely unrealistic with the scenes (which appeared to happen in a few instances in this film). With this problem standing in his way director John Singleton did manage to at least make the racing interesting by including more stunts into the sequences than had been done before, some of which were a little harder to believe than others. It was this decision that helped keep the racing from feeling stale, yet also resulted in a more gimmicky feeling than the previous film's races had. Despite all that, director John Singleton did a very good job in trying to differentiate his movie from the original, while at the same time keeping a similar feel and tone. Not an easy task, but one that he managed to succeed in doing.    As I stated earlier Paul Walker was the only primary cast member to return forthis installment, and I had praised him previously for his work in the original film. However, for this movie he seemed unfocused and uninterested through several of his scenes, almost as if he were simply \\"phoning in\\" his performance. I'm not saying that Paul is the greatest actor of his generation, far from it actually, but his apparent aloofness to the material, and at times wooden portrayal, was very distracting. Despite the problems that Paul had in his role, there were several moments within the film where he actually came out of his funk, and delivered some very key scenes; namely those revolving around his past mistakes and how they have effected his decisions and choices ever since.    Joining Paul Walker we have actor Tyrese Gibson, who has become quite a decent actor in his own right since this film. Now, his performance in this movie is troubled like Paul Walker's, but for different reasons. Unlike Paul, Tyrese clearly enjoys his role, and seems to really be trying to invest himself in the performance; however, his talent had not yet been honed enough to let him fully deliver in all his scenes. This is best illustrated by what is easily one of the worst line readings within this film, and reminds me of Hayden Christensen's horribly flat utterance of the words \\"Don't underestimate my power!\\" in \\"Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\", which is, \\"I have a problem with authority.\\" Wow, could a line be delivered any flatter and with any less conviction, obviously it could be if Hayden had delivered it, but still that was atrocious and by all accounts should have resulted in another take to try to get it right (take note director John Singleton).    Alongside the two leads is actress Eva Mendes as an undercover FBI agent working inside the drug cartel. Eva was very good in this role, and had the good fortune of actually receiving a female character that was given more to do in this film than Michelle Rodriguez or Jordana Brewster was in the first one.Cole Hauser as the drug lord gave a decent performance, and seemed to do the best he could with what he was given to work with. The problem with his character was that he wasn't really a guy that was all that interesting, and truth be told he seemed more like a stock villain from any other action film. I know that the main focus for this series will always be the cars, but a little effort could have been put into making this villain a little more of a threat and much more developed as a character. Truthfully, even though we rooted for him, Vin Diesel's character Dom was in essence a bad guy in the original movie, but it was the way his character was developed to be a more complicated guy than what you merely see on the surface that made him so interesting. That is what was sorely lacking in this movie's villain; I'm not saying you need a villain that you can root for, but at least give me one that isn't so one-dimensional.    All that being said, for me \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" was a generally fun ride with plenty of high-energy racing, a decent story, and average acting for the most part (with a few bright spots here and there); however, the movie never did quite capture what made the first one such a success, so it does fall somewhat short in the end.    \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B001PTG4C8|5.0|'Restless' contains two narrative threads, one modern (mid-1970s) and the other circa 1940, that are interlaced as alternate chapters.  In the modern segment we had a young mother trying to sort out her life, and is coping with an increasingly odd-acting mother who announces that she is not who she thinks is; in fact she is a Russian-born WW II spy.  In the pre-WW II thread we see how this woman became a spy and what sort of spying she actually did.  Both narrative threads blend together beautifully; the book is immensely readable.  It all comes together with a satisfying conclusion.      PS - I admit William Boyd is one of my favorite authors, and 'Restless' is on par with the best of his works.
B001ED7C58|4.0|Part of what makes the film version of \\"Twilight\\" work is the fact that its music fits it perfectly.  For fans of the film (and the book) this soundtrack provides those songs in a near perfect collection.<br /><br />Opening with the \\"baseball\\" song from the film, Muse's \\"Supermassive Black Hole,\\" the tone is set early for the remainder of the disc.  The song is haunting, funky, and very listenable.  From there the album roles into the first of two Paramore tunes, \\"Decode.\\"  Personally, I find this to be the strongest offering by Paramore on the album.  The Black Ghost's \\"Full Moon\\" and the surprisingly good \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" by Linkin Park follow.<br /><br />The next three songs (and the track from Muse) are, in my opinion the best reasons to purchase this album.  Mutemath's \\"Spotlight\\" is upbeat and infectious and is my favorite song on the album.  Perry Farrell offers up \\"Go All The Way (Into The Twilight)\\" and this is followed up by 90's rockers Collective Soul's \\"Tremble For My Beloved.\\"<br /><br />Paramore's second (and weaker) track, \\"I Caught Myself,\\" is next, and although it is good, it drags down the album's momentum.  Blue Foundation's \\"Eyes On Fire\\" and Robert Pattinson's Chris Isaak-on-sedatives-like \\"Never Think\\" do very little to help repair the damage from Paramore, but don't entirely kill the album.<br /><br />The album closes with the excellent \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\" from Iron & Wine and \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" keyed by Carter Burwell.  These two songs redeem the previous tracks and make for a well-rounded album.<br /><br />Is it worth five stars?  Not at all, but it is one of the best soundtracks to be rolled out in a long time.  Fans of pop, emo and techno will find this album to their liking.  Fans of the film will also enjoy this album.  Recommended.
B000002OX7|1.0|These guys are the worst of the worst when it comes to music. One, I've never seen them on MTV, and two, the songs are awful, radio unfriendly, and above all untalented. Like Baba O'Riley, which is just the same note over and over and something about a teenage wasteland. Whatever. And Won't Get Fooled Again is very radio and MTV unfriednly.<br /><br />And Behind Blue Eyes makes me infuriated. Why did they take a Limp Bizkit masterpiece and turn it into crap?<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague.

1401300529|4.0|This is one of the odder books I've read in recent years. Over the decades, I've read a few books which, at first glance, appeared to be about something, but on further examination turned out to be about something almost completely different. I can remember a book, written many years ago, that was true crime, and was about a sensational murder that happened in London. The author of the book got caught up in a libel trial in England, and the second half of the book was about British libel law--not uninteresting, but not what you expected when you looked at the dust jacket, which talked exclusively about the murder.    The Coldest Winter is packaged unusually. The dust jacket is translucent (you can see through it pretty easily) with the author's name and the title of the book on the jacket. The cover of the book has a photo of American troops tramping down a road in a column against a snow-covered hillside. It's pretty bleak and desolate, and gives you a sense of the war and the harshness of the climate. If the dust jacket is off of the book, though, you can't even tell what the title is except by opening the book.    When you open the book up, and look at its contents, you see that there are no photos at all. Instead, there are two dozen maps, complete with a key to explain the symbols used to designate the military units on them, and a glossary that explains the sizes of the various military units, along with the more common military hardware. When you see all of this at the beginning of a book, you have the impression this is going to be some pretty hardcore military history, with the author following units around the battlefield, discussing the course of particular actions, and explaining in detail why things came out the way they did. Imagine my surprise, then, when most of that turned out not to be here, with the bulk of the book discussing, instead, the personalities of the various players in the war.    So take the first action of the Korean War in which American units participated. This is the action where Task Force Smith disintegrated. There's a detailed map of the action, showing TF Smith's position in considerable detail, with arrows for both the North Korean People's Army infantry, and (a different kind of arrow) their tanks. The narrative tells you that TF Smith's soldiers fired a few rounds from their bazookas, and then ran away because the NKPA tanks, running down the road, were unstoppable. The narrative is correct, but rather cursory; the map would have served a much more detailed account of the battle.    This theme continues throughout the book. I think the difficulty here is that the narrative isn't really about the battles that the army and marines fought in Korea. Instead, it's for the most part about the policy decisions made, in Washington, Tokyo, and Korea itself (and to a smaller extent in Moscow and Peking) by the various major players directing the war. For whatever reason, Halberstam this time decided that he couldn't write a top-down history of the war, without including accounts of the war itself, the product of the decisions that were being made on high. The result is a somewhat disjointed account of the fighting, combined with terrific portraits of the major participants. This last part is the heart of the book, and what saves it from mediocrity.    The account of the war itself is remarkably brief, in some places, and then very detailed, Cornelius Ryan-style, in others. When the author is being cursory, he can dismiss whole campaigns, that took weeks or months, in a paragraph or so. Between TF Smith's disintegration and the Pusan perimeter, the author only briefly discusses the battles in which (among other things) General Dean was captured. He deals with most of the Pusan perimeter battles very briefly, but spends considerable time on one particular battle, the one he thinks was the NKPA's high water mark. Inchon is only briefly discussed (again the map is more detailed than the actual narrative) and then, after discussing matters in Washington, we discover the army is up by the Yalu, and the Marines are at Chosen Reservoir. The narrative works this way throughout the book. When Seoul is liberated for the second time it's not even mentioned in the text.    Halberstam, as I said, instead concentrates on the major players, for the most part American, and some of the more minor characters he finds interesting. He spends a lot of time discussing Douglas MacArthur, and a little bit less on Walton Walker (the 8th Army commander, controlling almost all the troops in Korea) and Ned Almond (MacArthur's Chief of Staff, who also commanded X Corps, the rest of the troops in Korea). Walker was eventually killed in a traffic accident, and replaced my Matthew Ridgway, and he too is covered in some detail. O.P. Smith, who commanded the 1st Marine Division at Chosen Reservoir, gets some attention, also. Oddly, probably the most colorful character in Marine Corps history, Chesty Puller, was at both Inchon and Chosen Reservoir, and he is only briefly mentioned. Other army commanders, both Corps and division, get only brief mention or none at all.    By contrast, the narrative spends considerable time discussing MacArthur, Almond, Walker, Ridgway, President Truman, Dean Acheson, and George Kennan. There's even a pretty detailed section on Charles Willoughby, an odd character of German extraction (complete with accent) who somehow wound up being MacArthur's Intelligence Chief, and essentially fitted his reports to his boss's wishes. The book is generally unfavorable to MacArthur, Willoughby, and Almond, and favorable to Ridgway, Truman, and Smith (to the extent he's discussed). Acheson, Kennan, and Walton Walker fall somewhere in the middle, as far as the author is concerned.    I generally enjoyed this book. It took me awhile to understand what the author was doing, and what the book was about. This is unusual because usually, when you read a dust jacket, it tells you about the book, and you can learn more by reading the stuff at the front of the book. In this case, all of that was more or less deceptive, and the book turned out to be about something else...but once I figured that out, I enjoyed what was presented.
B001EO748M|5.0|For the first time ever, a series has come along about Henry VIII and his lifetime pursuit of a male heir, that allows us to understand how he ever got any of these women in the first place!  This Henry is young, hormonal, yummy, and to top it off, he is the most powerful man in the british isles - who could resist that???  I understand that as he aged he did become fat, was inflicted with gout, etc., but this series allows us to see him before all that happened.  Bravo!!!  Can't wait for season three.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I agree 100 percent with Mr Innes' review. This is a fantastic performance of the artist with a terrific band and excellent backup singers in a once-in-a-lifetime concert for dvd. I have been waiting for something like this for a long time. The only other performance video I have ever seen was a longtime ago on Austin City Limits in black and white. If I am unable to ever see him in person, then this will be a fine substitute-maybe there will be a blue-ray version of this
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Religious belief is founded in faith, the condition of believing in something that is unseen by the person of faith. \\"Doubt\\" as a concept is the polar opposite, the yin to the yang of faith, but both bound together at the hip like theological Siamese twins.<br /><br />People of faith prize the highest kind of faith - the unshaking, unswavering, unalterable faith that absolutely believes, no matter what.  I saw this kind of faith simplistically depicted in bumper stickers that proclaimed \\"God said it.  I believe it.  That settles it.\\" But is it okay for a person of faith to have doubt?<br /><br />John Patrick Shanley had already proven his abilities as a writer with, for example, his Oscar-winning script to the delightful \\"Moonstruck\\".  In \\"Doubt\\" he does double-duty and directs as well.<br /><br />The four principle performers all earned Oscar nominations, and this film is uniformly excellent. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Flynn, a compassionate Priest who opens the film with a sermon on exactly the topic of Doubt.  We learn that the man allows a place for doubt within his faith.  St. Nicholas is a grade school in Father Flynn's parish, and the principal there is Sister Aloysius, played by Meryl Streep, is a humorless nun who not only doesn't allow for any doubt in her beliefs or actions, but also doesn't allow for pretty much any views contrary to her extremely narrow view of the world.  She despises ball-point pens, for example, because you must press harder with a ball-point pen than with fountain pens, and she has an undisguised contempt for those who use ball-point pens - such as Father Flynn.  But the rich screenplay also shows a little of the humane side of Sister Aloysius as she helps and shields an elderly nun who is going blind, fearing that the poor dear will be put out to pasture if her disappearing sight is discovered.  None of the characters are one dimensional.<br /><br />Amy Adams is superb as Sister James, a bright young nun who teaches history and withers before the stern gaze of Sister Aloysius.<br /><br />At this Brooklyn Catholic school young Donald Miller enrolls.  Donald is African-American and doesn't quite fit in.  The staff take particular note of young Mr. Miller - not wanting to single him out for good or bad, but also wanting to make him feel welcome as in 1964 a young black man may not be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the all-white school.  Father Flynn in particular seems to encourage Donald, and in an early scene Donald confides that he aspires to become a priest as well.<br /><br />Sister James sees something... or does she?  She recognizes that what she has observed is circumstantial at best - Donald was called out of class to the rectory, and she is certain that she smells alcohol on his breath when he returns.<br /><br />Sister James dutifully informs Sister Aloysius, and the stern headmistress is absolutely certain - with no doubt - of the worst thing this can imply about ball-point pen-using Father Flynn.<br /><br />Father Flynn is confronted in a series of sensational scenes by Sister Aloysius, pleading not only his innocence, but also a \\"how DARE you even THINK such a thing\\" attitude that adds...doubt... in the eyes of the audience.  But Father Flynn knows that a public accusation such as the one Sister Aloysius is certain of would ruin him.  What Priest could recover from a scandal with an altar boy, even if he could be \\"cleared\\" in an investigation?<br /><br />Viola Davis also earned an Oscar nomination as the boy's mother.  She sees the school as a way for Donald to escape both the neighborhood and her own abusive husband.  If the Priest is kind to the boy, why should she have doubt?<br /><br />The dialogue is razor sharp and as good as Shanley's script is, his words are helped immensely by the delivery and the body language of the remarkable cast.  The academy award for adapted screenplay went to \\"[[ASIN:B001P9KR8U Slumdog Millionaire]]\\", and I thought that film was excellent (as evidenced by my 5-star review), but I find this script a cut above. Not a tawdry story about a degenerate Priest, this is instead a story about the dichotomies that exist between moral rigidity and compassion, moral certainty and doubt, with a rich understory about the gap between the haves and have-nots, exemplified by Viola Davis as the woman who is willing to accept the possibility that a priest may be taking advantage of her son, as long as it gives the boy a possible road out of the nowhere world of their neighborhood.Not a tawdry story about a degenerate Priest, this is instead a story about the dichotomies that exist between moral rigidity and compassion, moral certainty and doubt, with a rich understory about the gap between the haves and have-nots, exemplified by Viola Davis as the woman who is willing to accept the possibility that a priest may be taking advantage of her son, as long as it gives the boy a possible road out of the nowhere world of their neighborhood.
B000174LUM|5.0|I bought this set on LP when it first came out, as a souvenir of the excellent -and at the time revelatory - Covent Garden production, which arrived via Turin and Vienna. The cast in the recording is identical to the stage performances except that poor old Silvano Carroli - who was very good - was edged out by a bigger star: Sherrill Milnes. I do not much hold that against Milnes as he here delivers one of his most subtle and thrilling performances on disc; the part of the snarling sheriff with romantic leanings fits him like a glove. Similarly, Domingo gives a performance to rank alongside his Manrico (also for Mehta) and his Radames for Muti. I don't always think he is ideal when more spinto heft is required, but he is here in clarion voice, singing tenderly, too, when required. Carol Neblett proved to be one of the few sopranos able to stay the course in the cruelly taxing rôle of Minnie and although she does not quite deliver the excitement provided by Tebaldi - any more than Domingo can rival Del Monaco or Corelli for sheer vocal glamour - she makes a complete, touching character out of the lonely camp-girl, has all the notes and is in vibrant voice. There is so much lovely, innovative and unusual music in this opera that I can forgive the moments of crassness and sentimentality in all that cowboy stuff - and some things are genuinely moving. The supporting cast is especially strong and they are clearly a wholly integrated group with the kind of rapport that comes from performing live together. The tone is set early on when Gwynne Howell (as Jake Wallace, \\"il cantastorie del campo\\") sings a meltingly beautiful account of the ballad  \\"Che faranno\\"; the dignity of his singing quite redeems its dangerous sentimentality. Mehta's direction is fluid and flexible; he lingers where he should and whips up the tension when its needed. The sound is beautifully rich, clear and balanced. I am not saying that this is the only, or even the best, studio recording in that I still favour the gung-ho glory of the earlier Decca set but it's a very cohesive and satisfying account of this oddly patchy work.ll favour the gung-ho glory of the earlier Decca set but it's a very cohesive and satisfying account of this oddly patchy work.

1400034205|4.0|I read this book as a youth and at a time I was seeking answers to some very important questions, among them,  \\"What is the best way for a person to live his or her life?\\"  Larry's search held my full attention at the time and I think made a significant impact on me and making me open to ways of thinking different that the ones I had grown up with.  Larry's young and unexpected contact with death forced him to consider the value of life in a way he had never before and in so doing made him an outsider to most people and groups, especially the upper class milieu in which he had been raised.  I recently reread this book for a book club and found it still very pertinent and full of many truths, even though some of them are not very practical.  I continue to search for the best way to live, it is a question I ask every day, and the answers consist mostly of seeking ways to be kind and helpful to others and to cause no harm to others - to promote and seek peace. I think this book is a worthwhile read for anyone seeking Truth in its purest form, whatever the person's stage of life.
0439023483|4.0|Katniss has grown up in a poor community in which people barely scrape by. This community and others like it are kept poor by a strong central government bent on preventing rebellion. One way in which the government asserts control is by hosting the Hunger Games. This annual event is a lottery of sorts: a boy and a girl from each community is conscripted and sent into an arena. The conditions in the arena are unpredictable, and even access to food and water is uncertain. The task at hand is, simply, to kill one another until only one person is left standing. That person wins.<br /><br />The Hunger Games are required televised viewing for all citizens. Those who live in opulence eagerly follow it as a reality TV show; those who live in the oppressed communities are compelled to watch by law, and helplessly stand by as their two representatives struggle to survive.<br /><br />It's compelling to witness Katniss's struggle to survive in the arena. She faces some formidable opponents and goes up against nature, human-made weapons, and a resourceful \\"production company\\" that is bent on keeping the Hunger Games interesting for its audience.<br /><br />The reader is complicit, pulled along, rooting for Katniss. This leaves us uncomfortably close to the opulent Hunger Game fans in the book. We're in suspense, following each twist and turn. This is disturbing, to at once condemn a cruel social practice and yet to be riveted by its presentation as a reality TV program. This makes it easy to see how our world could get there from here.<br /><br />The book is marred for me by a certain lack of plausibility. It's a great suspense novel, and a really good character study, but there were a few too many convenient turns of events. The biggest flaw in this book is that Katniss is conveniently spared moral culpability on several occasions. There is always a mitigating factor to make her actions OK; yet, when her opponents kill and maim, they too often relish it. It's too pat.<br /><br/>Still, I couldn't put this one down -- and I'm looking forward to reading [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]], the next book in the series.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Pitch-perfect period drama set in 1930s Los Angeles. Angelina Jolie is fantastic and understated as a mother whose son is kidnapped, then law enforcement officials say they've \\"Solved\\" the case and try to get her to accept a different kid as her own.<br /><br />It was so infuriating and implausible (Nobody would do that!) that I had to keep reminding myself, as we are told at the beginning of the movie, that it is based on a true story!<br /><br />This is an old-fashioned \\"movie movie,\\" when movies had stories and plots and characters you care deeply about. Of course, it is a Clint Eastwood joint. We expect nothing less from Mr. Eastwood.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|At long last, finally a DVD of Stevie Wonder. On viewing this DVD I am well pleased. What can you say Stevie singing all his hits, esecially good is,one of my favorites, \\"Lately\\" his vocals really shine. His daughter Aiesha sings a song I am not familiar with but does a good job. The band is good and solid and play with a high level of energy making this a must have purchase for anybody that likes Stevie's music.   One disappointment is that there are no extras or backstage interviews, had they included some old footage from years past it would be a better package. But whose complaining, I am glad to have this DVD at long last, maybe next time.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|The Academy went down yet another notch in my estimation for all but ignoring this masterpiece from the master, Clint Eastwood. Others here have described the rich plot. The group of unknown Vietnamese actors are PERFECTLY led by Clint Eastwood, as the silent, grouchy, proud, imperfect, highly principled American guy we all know--or wish we knew better. Gran Torino is poignant, at times funny, and inspirational. It could be Clint Eastwood's career best, Dirty Harry come full urban-American circle. Shame on you, Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. You goofed by ignoring a lot of classics we all love now, and you goofed on this, big time.

This story definitely has the potential to grow in originality, and perhaps we'll see a more unique storyline with the next book in the series.

B001O0J02Y|5.0|Since Hendrix's passing, people have been covering his work for years, but years, but this album's tracks were the biggest source. \\"Up From the Skies\\" has been done by Sting and Rickie Lee Jones, who both proved that the wah-wah may have been the most prominent feature of this original version here, but the song wasn't dependent on that gimmick. Now that it's permissible to critique Eric Clapton without being called a heretic, I can finally come out and say that the earliest cover of the ballad \\"Little Wing\\" on \\"Derek & the Dominos\\" was annoyingly strident. Sting's later version was a bit less so, but if the bikers who idolized \\"Derek\\" re-ee-ally want to know how the song is supposed to sound, here's how. When this album came out, rock'n'roll wasn't supposed to be in 3/4 time--that meter was for those stodgy waltzes your music teacher forced on you in school and your parents did at weddings. Jimi didn't care--he wrote \\"One Rainy Wish\\". Back then, in the intro \\"EXP\\", I didn't know there was a real Paul Caruso, but he was later interviewed in the film \\"Jimi Hendrix\\". Listen to that track and you'll see that Jimi does a great laid-back caricature of Caruso's professorial tones here. But that was Jimi for you--his awkward, shy patter between numbers in live shows could really give you the wrong impression of the man's genius.
B00028HBKC|5.0|The VHS was wonderful.  The DVD is wonderfully graphic.  If one finds it too graphic, one needs to think of the greater reality of Christ's suffering.  Perfect for the Lenten season.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|\\"Slumdog Milionaire\\" is definitely a feel-good movie - from early on,young Jamal [Dev Patel] wins our hearts as he desperately tries to find his childhood sweetheart Latika [Freida Pinto] by entering the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\\" Incredulous and sceptical of Jamal's intelligence [after all, Jamal is a 'slumdog'], the show's host [Anil Kapoor] gets him carted off by the police for interrogation. Faced by the cynical inspector [Irfan Khan of \\"Namesake\\"], Jamal proceeds to convince the policeman of his innocence by recounting his childhood experiences till the present that accounts for his almost miraculous run of good luck on the show.<br /><br />I loved the child actors in this show - the ones who played Jamal, his brother Salim and Latika as children were absolutely incredible and wholly credible as street children struggling to survive, falling prey to the most predatory and repugnant of criminals, those who maim children in order that the kids may 'convincingly' beg on the streets to fill the criminals coffers. One of the most horrifying scenes in this movie is the part where the criminal mastermind watches over the removal of a little boy's eyes.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars you may ask - I liked this movie a lot but I did find that it didn't truly explore the plight of street children which it purportedly aims to portray on-screen. The coverage somehow seems shallow, using the story arc of the child maiming syndicate to shock audiences instead. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I've watched too many Indian movies that deal more convincingly with such themes - \\"Nayagan\\" [Tamil, starring Kamal Hasan, a renowned South Indian actor], Thalapathi [Tamil, stars Rajni Kanth], the incomparable Salaam Bombay [1988,Hindi by Mira Nair], and also City of Joy [1992, English, starring Patrick Swayze] all are more credible in showing the plight of street children.<br /><br />\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" on the other hand is a Bollywood fairytale with a predictably happy ending. It makes one feel good, and in a world filled with cruelty and depravity, most of us are happy to see the fulfillment of Jamal's dreams. But reality is very different, and the majority of street children in India will never experience even a fraction of the success that Jamal attains in this movie. Final verdict: excellent and visually stunning escapist fare.It makes one feel good, and in a world filled with cruelty and depravity, most of us are happy to see the fulfillment of Jamal's dreams.

B000H7J9RQ|5.0|I first saw this video in 1986 when it was first released.  The DVD is honoring its 20th Anniversary.  Barbra Streisand at her very best in the relaxed home environment with a star studded audience that included political figures and actors. This DVD is beautiful with vibrant colors and outstanding sound.  She sings mostly old favorites, does an impeccable job on Over the Rainbow, wows the audience with The Way We were, and closes with a stirring America the Beautiful.  Barry Gibb makes a surprise visit and their duets are okay but not the highlights for me.  Barbra Streisand sings with such passion and effortlessness and makes it seem as though she has just written the song herself.  Brilliant  This concert was a fund raiser for various (liberal) causes including raising money for then Senator Alan Cranston.  My only caveat is that there is no closed captioning which made it difficult for this hearing impaired listener to totally appreciate.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Heath Ledger creates the most complicated, evil, diabolical, demented, sociopathic killer since Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal. I have not seen a better depiction of a bad guy since Silence of the Lambs. Joker has always been the embodiment of pure choas. Like the movie says some people are just plain evil, they commit atrocities for no reason, \\"they just want to watch the world burn.\\" The Joker has no sob story like most bad guys in movies. He IS just pure evil. This aspect depicts something that most people forget in our day to day lives. Sometimes there is no sob story. Sometimes people are just plain sociopathic evil with no regard to others. This should be a good wake up call to people.     Overall wonderful performance by Heath Ledger. He more than deserves an academy award for his creation of this of this complicated character.

0452289963|5.0|I started to read Eckhart Tolle's first book, The Power of Now, and through it away in frustration and disbelief that it represented anything spiritual.The only thing it reflected was a damaged ego.    The one reservation I have with the above book is the source for the  book. This is a major concern. Tolle's notes do not address the real source.    I have no problem with the ideas developed, but I believe a writer  owes his audience source information for them to evaluate.    With that said, I believe the book is well organized, writen, with  excellent clarity. It needs to be read as you would drink a fine wine,  with a lot of savoring. It cannot be rushed.

B001SN78JO|3.0|Jim Carrey's latest film has some good moments. Carrey gets to squish his face into well-known rubbery poses. The storyline is cute. Hints of Liar, Liar are present but it's different enough to be clever and fresh on its own merit. I have really appreciated most of Carrey's movies, both the serious like The Truman Show and more slapstick like Fun with Dick and Jane, and think he's a good actor.<br /><br />Zooey Deschanel is sarcastically charming as usual. I'm drawn to dry humor and she didn't disappoint in Yes Man.<br /><br />But one thing bugged me to the point that I'm not going to watch it again, nor am I giving it a glowing recommendation. Same old, same old, rude sexual jokes and comments pepper the first half hour or so including an embarrassing [...] comment and a few references to genitals. A scene involving an elderly woman offering to pay for a neighborly gesture with sexual favors, and the follow-up scene with Carl (Carrey) on the bed and the dentures getting dropped into a glass of water. Then she targets another young man. All of these scenes and comments don't add to the plot line or humor. Oh, maybe an embarrassed titter, but really, the humor is junior high at best and it gets old.<br /><br />We don't see the hero and heroine in bed. Carl turns away an opportunity with another woman. So I was left wondering about the whole point of Carl and his neighbor's little encounter.<br /><br />I really wanted to respect Carl and his friends and root for him as he began to grow and change, but the distraction of the adolescent sexual humor really detracted from a story that could have been really good.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|You may think there is a contradiction in the title of this review and the number of stars awarded it. There really isn't, the stars are for the acting which is absolutely flawless. And the actors are the right choices for the roles they're in, so if you want to see some really great acting read no further this movie is for you. The trouble comes in when this movie asks you to suspend disbelief and believe that the events in the movie could have occurred in the time period of the film, and it is those doubts that keep you from fully believing the events in the movie could have transpired.<br /><br />Doubt is about a Catholic priest Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who goes into a new parish and runs afoul of the principal of the school Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) who believes Father Flynn has an improper relationship with a young boy under his charge as an altar boy. Sister Aloysius suspects Father Flynn for no other reason than he delivered a sermon on doubt. The movie follows Sister Aloysius attempts to confirm her suspicions through the aid of neophyte nun Sister James (Amy Adams).<br /><br />The movie is really a parable set in 1964  and it makes no excuses about that, and I have no problem with writers or filmmakers wanting to present a tale of morality and its consequences. For every innocent act by Father Flynn there has to be a not so innocent interpretation or action by Father Flynn, the purpose of the whole drama is cast to doubt about Father Flynn's actions and in the mind of the viewer, in that it succeeds as a parable. But it has to fit within the context of the time period chosen to illustrate the moral problem. There's no denying that the Catholic Church has a lot to answer for about pedophilia, but watching the bonus feature about the making of the film director writer John Patrick Shanley tells of how he came to write the play this movie is based on. He wrote the play because of a nun that he remembered from first grade. Shanley may want to cast the nun's as hero's, maybe he was rescued by one or wished to be, but the problem is Sister Aloysius seems imbued with modern sensibilities that are not out of step with our own point of view, but they are out of step with the times they're set in, and in the lengths Sister Aloysius goes to confirm her suspicions about Father Flynn. She is repeatedly told to stop but doesn't, and in fact steps up her attacks on Father Flynn. I was an altar boy a few years after the period the film takes place in, and even then the priests word was law, and if a priest told a nun to stop something and she didn't she would have been transferred out of the parish pretty quick. There is a hint that Sister Aloysius wasn't always a nun in that she mentions having a husband during WWII and it really stands out because there is no other hint or idea that Sister Aloysius had a life outside of being a nun. Is this fragment a leftover part of a subplot that something from Sister Aloysius' life was informing the way she acts? If so, it should have been developed more, if that's what it was meant to do. The ending doesn't stay true to the concept of doubt either, although it makes a stab at claiming it does. Sister Aloysius gives us a logical and definite resolution as to what occurred with Father Flynn, so that when she confesses her doubts it rings falsely because we've already been presented a definite resolution and one that would confirm her suspicions as true.<br /><br />I have to comment about the directing only because the usage of some of the directors devices is noticeable and heavy handed in their usage. The symbolism and foreshadowing especially seem obvious, the use of wind as a vehicle for change, at one point Sister Aloysius quips that the wind is changing the world, I half expected her to quote Bob Dylan. And Shanleys use of camera angles at climatic moments to illustrate the dissonance of the characters state of mind comes treacherously close to the tilted camera angles used in the old Batman TV series.<br /><br />This a good movie that has great actors and acting, but it could have been a great movie.series.

Five stars for the director, cast, and crew, or one star for the DVD packaging/subtitling?<br /><br />If someone rinky dink outfit releases a poorly prepared DVD of \\"Citizen Kane,\\" and customers object by giving it an average ranking of one star, what does the young movie fan, who has never seen \\"Citizen Kane,\\" make of that one-star rating? He or she decides the movie stinks.<br /><br />Until Amazon fixes this, I would suggest ranking movies on their merits, and then adding packaging gripes as a warning/aside.<br /><br />But \\"Let the Right One In,\\" on its own merits, deserves five stars.

1416562605|4.0|I came across this book by accident at the library. I thought it was so creative and amusing in delivery.  I felt the author gave a descriptive narrative where I could picture these places and the characters.  It was really funny in parts and as everyone has acknowledged, it's a page turner.  I do agree the novel fell a little flat at the end. I keep thinking maybe if the white tiger hadn't told us from page one that he killed his boss and left it as a surprise then he could have overcome the anti-climactic feel of the book.  I know this book has gotten some criticism for being too hard on India but I feel the author is not being hard on India per se but on corruption. I would love to see this author  get his hands on the corruption here in America. His writing is so clever and biting.      Sometimes I feel the author does break character with the White tiger and that the white tiger is simply too astute, philosophically speaking, coming from the background he did. He had no like-minded people to converse with in terms of friends or co-workers, to wax on the way he did on certain things. Good philosophical skills come from a lot of exchanging of ideas with others of high intellect. It's just a little sketchy at points but I do give this book a whopping 4 stars for it's wit, fast-paced narrative and the tackling of important ideas in fighting against oppression. One of these ideas is sometimes life gets very messy and lines of morality get blurred when people are trying to elicit change and fight for their rights as it does for the main character. Not enough people are willing to get their hands dirty and nothing ever changes, really, until they do. I look at the diminishing of the american middle class and all the compromises they have made along the way: taking jobs with no offered health insurance, people willing to work two positions while being paid for one, working overtime while on salary because they feel bad if they don't, never taking all their vacation days. Now all the employers expect that, so goodbye 40 hour work week and quality of life, hello chicken coop.

B001OD6HN6|5.0|April 12,2009<br />When I first saw Lily Allen on SNL sometime ago it was like getting punched in the solar plexus, the recognition by a music critic of extraordinary talent. It's interesting, but the Killers, who were on SNL three times last year hit me the same way. Going back to Dusty Springfield, Billy J. Kramer, Van Morrison, The Yardbirds, The Beatles, The Stones, Elvis Costello, Thea Gilmore and now Lily Allen getting red hot; how does the UK come up with the most extraordinary and exponentially creative, instrumentally and vocally fabulous recording artists? There must be an elixir on that Ferry Cross the Mersey that they all are drinking that causes them to be so special and charming. Hey, I am an anglophile from birth. Lily Allen is a gutsy, often explicit and captivating entertainer. I downloaded her MP3 Fear and continue to be impressed. Besides having a \\"healthy\\" very feminine physical presence, she is an electric songstress with a blend of jazz, reggae, pop and soft rock and quirky synth in her delivery. Lily is going on tour soon in the United States and I not only recommend that you purchase some CDs here but definitely, if you can get a ticket go go go. Lily Allen is going to be bigger and bigger since that SNL appearance. That show may need some new blood on the skit side but with the Killers and Lily, they are hitting those balls over the fence on the music set.<br /><br />jay adler music critic
0062515675|2.0|The author's story-telling is truly pathetic, wherein he develops a poorly constructed tale with really banal dialogue between the monk and his protege. His writing style is worse, which can probably be bettered by a junior high student. Here's an exercise- just count the number of times the author uses a variation of the following: \\"Julian knew he was on a roll\\". My guess, about 5.<br /><br />- The author (through the 'monk') repeats famous quotes or principles as his own.

Illegal copies nearly always have rounded corners. Home printed covers have square corners!  Also, the original DVD came with TWO DVDs. This is one DVD, with both sides in use.  A cheap Russian copy!!  DO NOT BUY!!  You will get a cheap copy!!  If you order this, find it is a copy, make sure you complain to Amazon, to get your money back, and, hopefully shut down this thief!!
B000RZGFYS|5.0|Woo hoo!  Older album review time!    Alright, so over 20 years have passed since Reign in Blood was put out and it still remains one of the craziest albums ever.  Metal's gotten more br00tal since the release of this record, but the record is still as intense now as it was then.  Unlike most other releases which have some level of attempted-prog-wankery, these guys were in and out in about 30 minutes with frantic solos from the guitar tandem of Jeff Hannemann and Kerry King, Tom Araya's wailing vocals, and Dave Lombardo's drumming template for modern metal.  There's a lot of times where the music goes from metal to cacophony but if it doesn't do that, IT AIN'T SLAYER!!!  All brought to you by Rick Rubin who's done nothing but help bring good music to people throughout the years.      All metal fans should own the record.  As for other music fans, there's probably some of you who may be as reserved as I was when I was younger, worrying that this kinda music would rot the brain and convert you to a satanist.  Hardly from it, but if you can sit through equal parts of horror and war films, then you'll probably find the same degree of intensity on this album.  Do check it out.

B00065GX64|5.0|M, by any definition, qualifies as a classic film. This latest DVD version is a high quality reproduction. I think that there are elements of this film that remain unequalled in their dramatic impact. One example would be the cutting back and forth between the police meeting and the criminals meeting with each developing a plan for capturing the child killer.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I've lost count of the number of times I've seen these movies on DVD, but I'm glad I got this blu-ray edition. I feel like I'm watching them for the first time. I made a side-by-side comparison on a 90\\" home theatre projection screen, and the improvements on this blu-ray are substantial enough for one's viewing pleasure to be enhanced manifold. The images are sharper, but not so sharp until they lose their film-like quality. Colours are much more solid and vibrant. I know there have been many complaints about too much grain, but for a movie like the Godfather, grain is essential for the Rembrandt-like quality of the interior scenes, and the sepia glow of the exteriors. Over-zealous processing would have ruined its moody atmospherics. There is a point beyond which a restoration job robs a classic movie of its classic aura. Thankfully, this has not happened with the Godfather on blu-ray.
B000F0V0LI|5.0|'The Searchers' is by no means a perfect movie but, at the same time, it IS a great movie.  It is fascinating that John Wayne was at his best when he stepped out of his classic 'good guy' image.  This is true of all his truly great movies whether it be 'The Searchers', 'True Grit', or his almost perfect, 'The Shootist.'  Wayne was an actor acutely concerned about his image and I would love to know how he personally felt about roles in which he played flawed, complex characters.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a compilation of historical information and novelistic interpretation.  Cynthia Parker was actually kidnapped by the Comanche and was only 'liberated' after 24 years.  She had married and gave birth to Quanah Parker who became the Comanche's greatest warchief.  This is only the bare bones of stories played out multiple times in the land that would become America.  Settlers on the frontier are the victims of lightening raids by hostile war parties.  All seems to be well when suddenly someone is crashing in your door.  Families were slowly tortured and murdered...all to the amusement of the warriors.  Children and women were sometimes taken captive.  The children were oftentimes raised as their own by the tribe.  Women captured were, generally speaking, regarded as the mutual property of the war party, and, in the vast majority of cases, the victims of mass rape.  On arriving at the village, the raped women became the sole property of the capturing warrior and, again in most cases, was used as a slave for both work and sex.<br /><br />This is the context of the attitudes that the John Wayne character expresses so well.  People living on the frontier lived in almost constant horrific fear...and hatred.  For those who actually visit the scenes of the torture, rape and murder of friends and relatives the hatred could become consuming...as it nearly consumes Wayne's character.  This is perhaps difficult to understand in these politically correct times but, let me suggest that those who condemn these attitudes search their own hearts, as well.  For us, these things are primarily historical and bear no more relationship to us than, let's say, stories of a massacre in far off Africa or Asia, 500 years ago.  At one time, however, the danger was personal and, you, me and virtually everyone else, had we lived under the danger of a scalping knife, would have felt very differently.<br /><br />This is not to justify the destruction of the native americans but it is to place it in a personal context, without which the destruction seems not only wrong but nonsensical.  The Wayne character is idiosyncratic and prejudiced.  He has survived a long war and refused to sign the Yankee 'Loyalty Oath'.  He returns home three years after the War and, at one point, gives the child Debbie a military decoration...probably Maximillian/Mexican...as a bauble, so we suspect that Wayne didn't give up the fight in 1865 but only moved it to Mexico.  He also knows a lot about the Plains Indians and even speaks Comanche....but it doesn't make him love them.<br /><br />Wayne's brother's family is slaughtered by the Comanche...and he views the horrific scene with grim hatred.  Two girls...one in her late teens and the other, Debbie, a child...have been carried off by the war party.  Wayne and others pursue.  Wayne, by himself, discovers the body of the older girl...raped and mutilated...and covers her with his Confederate great coat and 'I buried her with my own hands', he tells the others in his grim but harrowing grief.<br /><br />The search for little Debbie goes on literally for years and, when Wayne discovers that she has 'been with a buck', and been thereby contaminated, his search becomes that of a strange vengeance.  Debbie has been turned into one of the hated Comanche and must die.  On attacking the village in which Debbie is kept, Wayne, true to himself, scalps 'Scar' the chief who is keeping Debbie as a wife.  The last scenes of the movie are of both Debbie's and Wayne's redemption.  A great movie.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexicogreat movie.

0375826726|4.0|Paolini continues his Inhertiance saga with Brisingr. Originally, I understand he intended it to just be a trilogy, but I think he's been having so much fun developing his world and characters, as well as the story, that the story is just getting longer and longer. For some authors, that would be a bad thing, but for Paolini it is just giving him more room to develop and flex his fantastical and creative muscles.<br /><br />This is definitely not the book to start the Inheritance books with, so if you haven't read [[ASIN:0440240735 Eragon]] and [[ASIN:0440238498 Eldest]], do yourself a favor and get your hands on them as well.<br /><br />The book starts with a summary of the last two books, which you can definitely skip if you've recently finished reading the first two books of the series, but, if you're like me and it had been a bit, the quick rehash was a nice reminder of what had gone on before. There are little to no gaps between the events in the books of the series, each one picking up very shortly (as in days after) the last events of the previous book. This book is no exception, and you are thrown headlong into Eragon and Roran's fight to rescue Katrina, Roran's betrothed.<br /><br />To me the book kept a very lively pace. Paolini has become very adept at balancing the action with the more narrative sections of his stories. That said, when I came to the end, I really felt I had just read the next step in Eragon's journey. Just as in Eldest, this book moves along through the story of Eragon, but it would have a hard time standing on its own - in fact, when removed from the series, it is rather anti-climatic. There is really only one conflict that is resolved in this book (revealed in its name), and that conflict seems almost secondary when compared against the other conflicts of the story.<br /><br />In the end,  I highly recommend the Inheritance saga to any and all fans of the fantasy genre. It is in the vein of Tolkien and maybe even Robert Jordan (the latter being one who has indulged in the epitomy of the unending saga). But don't read this book without having first read Eragon and then Eldest, you would only be doing yourself a disservice.in the epitomy of the unending saga). But don't read this book without having first read Eragon and then Eldest, you would only be doing yourself a disservice.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I saw this concert when it was on PBS and thought it was superb.  When it was released as a cd/dvd combo I was intrigued but cautious.  The cd had just a few songs and I have a blu ray player.  Thank God I waited for here it is on blu ray and it is spellbinding, using blu ray and all its capabilities to their full effect.<br /><br />The video is crytal clear, crisp with vibrant colors.  The thing that is truly amazing here is the audio.  The menu just shows a 5.1 surround option but be sure to go thru the audio options on your blu ray remote for there is a spectacular lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  This is reason enough to purchase this concert.  I don't understand why they don't show this option on the menu or on the case.  The music will soar out of your theater system.  Spoken word as well as singing and instrumental are all stunning.<br /><br />The concert itself deserves the highest accolades.  There is almost 2 1/2 hours here of music.  It t is the perfect mix of conversation between David and each artist with the majority of the time being given to the music.  And it is music of the highest caliber.  Everyone will have some favorites here but each artist is in top form and each performance is perfection.  I didn't fast forward through any part of this.  My personal favorite is Katharine McPhee's powerful performance of SOMEWHERE and spellbinding duet with Andrea Bocelli on THE PRAYER.  I am also a huge Michael Buble fan and his charm and talent are put on full display here.  Kenny G, Josh Groban and Boz Scaggs are all superb.  I had never heard Blake Shelton before and I am a new fan.  I also got to relive my disco days with the amazing vocals of Cheryl Lynn on GOT TO BE REAL.<br /><br />This concert is a production of total class from beginning to end.  Each artist is given their time in the spotlight.  David Foster shows grace and true humility as his full musical legacy is displayed.  This concert is a must have and if you have blu ray you will be astonished at its visual and vocal beauty.  Even if you already have the dvd it is worth double dipping to get the glorious blu ray.  And if you don't have blu ray then you must get the dvd.<br /><br />Enjoy this must have concert.  It is a definite treat you will watch over and over.be astonished at its visual and vocal beauty.

0446401307|5.0|I liked this Harry Bosch novel very much and, unlike some reviewers, had no problem with the 12-hour time frame or the fact that this novel is shorter than most of the other Bosch books.  This time Harry is investigating a murder that has links to terrorism, a timely subject and a good device for author Michael Connelly to use to illustrate the one-up-manship and undercutting that goes on among the various law enforcement agencies that get called in on a big case.<br /><br />There is a good kicker at the end of the story too, and one that I have to admit I didn't see coming.  The Overlook is a good addition to the Bosch series and I recommend it for anyone who likes an entertaining read that is also well written and features interesting characters.

This one being a killer clown...for most of the book anyway.    The characters have depth and make you actually care about them. It remains strong today just as it did when it first came out.

I can't listen to these hip hop beats with his voice. The sad part is his voice and lyrics are nice, but then I hear fake drum beats and want to cringe. It really is a shame because I really like him as an artist. His last album took me some time to get into, but this album I won't even try to give into. When he opened for Linkin Park a few of the new songs actually sounded great because they had real drums behind them, but this music is a joke. Zero stars.

B000M341QE|4.0|The story is set in Boston's brutal underworld, where Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is the all-powerful crime boss.  Frank mentored a young man (Matt Damon) through the police academy and now he's both a State Trooper and a member of the mob, while the Staties have their own man (Leonardo DiCaprio) working inside Costello's organization.<br /><br />This movie is not for the squeamish; there are almost non-stop bloody killings and barely a line of dialogue that is isn't full of profanities.  Nicholson chews up the scenery as the ruthless kingpin, wallowing in his magnificent evilness.  Unfortunately, I couldn't quite believe Damon and DiCaprio as men who could commit such cruel acts; with their soft babyfaces they looked out of place and when they shared the screen it looked more like a magazine shoot than a shoot out. Leo's bogus attempt at a Boston accent also came up short. All of the mobsters mumble, making them hard to understand, but this is a visual story and a striking one at that.<br /><br />The movie is intense and thrilling, but definitely only for those who like tough crime dramas.

B001KQ4KCW|5.0|I saw this movie over the Christmas break and loved it! So I decided to read it for my English project. This book was great yet incredibly sad. Reading about the Holocaust from two 9 year old's point of view was very clever and interesting. Bruno did irritate me a little bit. He would complain about how annoying his sister is or that his house only has three floors instead of five. I mean Shmuel was a Jew who was beaten and starved. I'd like to tell Bruno \\"try being in his shoes for a day\\" which he did, and he surely paid for it. It also angered me when Bruno threw Shmuel under the bus by telling Lieutenant Kotler he didn't know who he was and hadn't given him food.UGH!!! Over all this book was great but the ending was extremely depressing.
031606792X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I would have never guessed the direction she took for this final book.  I think the second book, New Moon was not as good  or strong as the others. Looking at this last book I can only say I loved the fact that she took this story beyond your typical vampire plot with such diverse characters.   There are things that you have anticipated and things you could never have guessed at.  Characters that she scratched the surface on in the first books are woven in to this final book which I would love to see come to life on the screen. I am dissapointed it is the last book.
B000JVT1U0|1.0|I first heard about the Wicker Man in Full Circle's \\"Top 9 Movie Songs\\" countdown, placing it as #1 with \\"Willow's Song\\". I decided to see it because it was one of the few movies that paid attention to Paganism. I myself(teresa's daughter) am a pagan(wiccan respectively) and thought this movie would do a good job with the subject. I was proven wrong instantly. The antagonization of paganism really caught me off guard. Obviously, too many people non-cinematicaly antagonize paganism anyway, so i should have seen it coming. But i could easily guess I'm one of the few people who didn't turn a suspicious eye or scowl with disgust at the \\"blasphemy\\" of the pagan rites. I especially dislike the scenes involving the may-pole and the school. First, the may pole has nothing sinister about it whatsoever except in the eyes of people who's mind is clouded by their desire to snip out any sign of blasphemy in the world. Second, i don't see anything wrong with teaching the phalic symbolism of the may pole. To each their own beliefs, and this community, no matter how un-PC, is no exception. Besides children are already taught related matters about that age in Sex-Ed anyway! I am actually suprised at how unreactive the pagan community was to this movie. I don't know or care how accurate the more \\"sinister\\" pagan practices in the movie are, it's a bad thing(and i can't believe i'm saying this) to portray paganism in such a negative way. We need more positive movies about the pagans to clear our name. To clear up any misconceptions any ignorant people had about the craft and our beliefs, we don't hurt or manipulate people using or in the name of the craft, especially burning people in giant wicker men or using magick to seduce mates for our sexual pleasure. By the way, i saw no horror in this film whatsoever, just bull-headedness. I can confidently say the only redeemning quality of this film is the music. The celtic feel is really entrancing, just enough to make me consider purchasingthe soundtrack on iTunes. Willow's song in particular is very catchy. All in all, I mean no offense to the reader of this review whatsoever, my first thoughts of the movie were, \\"How can this piece of crap be so popular?!\\" My response to myself was that the men were too busy looking at all the nude women, and the rest were giving plaudits to how pro-christian and anti-anything else this movie is. I saw this movie only one, and i don't plan to ever see it again. To those looking for a horror film with good music, put this piece of crap down and look for Sweeney Todd, all people interested in the paganism should step away and pick up the Mists of Avalon. Anybody else, look away from this page, forget what you saw, and seek another film. This has to be the most over-rated film since Citizen Kane(which by the way was compared to the wicker man. Interesting connection...). Long story short, if i could give this movie 0 stars, i would! )0(

0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's riveting story takes her from tribal Somalia, through Saudi Arabia and Kenya, to become a prominent Dutch politician.  It is an amazing tale of emergence from oppression that is the fate of women in many Muslim cultures.  Her personal experience has led her to being outspokenly anti-Muslim as well as atheist.  She seems to think that being anti-Muslim leads automatically to atheism.<br /><br />The most controversial aspect of the book is the equation of Islam with totalitarianism and the rejection of all claims that Islam is essentially peaceful.  Her experience of Islam has been very one-sided and is understandably negative, but it is not necessary to equate Islam with the teachings of the Muslim Brotherhood and Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Hirsi Ali's story is worthy of international news because of the continuing threats against her life that give credence to her anti-Islamic positions.  She mentions the need for a Voltaire to emerge from Islam and seems increasingly to be playing that role.  Voltaire lived his life in exile, an experience that has become familiar to this very famous refugee.

I've been told I have great taste in movies from a lot of people, friends & family & some people I just met. I read some of the 1 star reviews about this movie. Most of those reviews are stupid people who are picky. One was even mad that the main star in this movie has sex with random women. Big deal! If they have little kids and don't want them to see this movie then don't let them see it. problem solved, I mean have good parenting skills people. It's called common sense! Other people were saying this movie was only special effects. So what that's what makes action movies great. The acting and comedy was there too. I thought it was a kickass movie. Even scientist are trying to make people super human in the future. They gear up are soldiers in iraq pretty hardcore. We can see and shoot around corners without even steping out in dangerous situations.  Iron man and the hulk and batman and wanted were all good movies. They made their millions and you see more 5 and 4 star votes on here then you do 1 star soo you know most people liked this movie.

0762434260|1.0|We bought these for our 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old sons.  They were very excited when we put them together (as they come in three pieces you must screw together).  They were both broken in a matter of minutes.  We taped them together in the middle, then the handles broke off too.  Not worth it at all!
0061339202|3.0|I was very excited to get my hands on this book after reading about it in Authentic Happiness. Years later I bought a copy of it in a Library sale. My expectations were higher than the book could fulfill. The readability was off and on. Unlike How we Decide, FLOW was at times a bore and I'm someone who really enjoys these sorts of books. It couldn't hold my interest even though I really wanted to get into it. The technique it has to impart is very useful. I just wish the book captured and utilized the idea to bring about flow in reading because it became a struggle to stay with.

6304806418|4.0|'Evita' is a brilliant film adaptation of the Broadway musical, written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. It tells the story of Argentina's First Lady Eva Duarte de Peron, also known as Evita. Evita was born into severe circumstances. Her father died when she was a little girl and her family (who was considered illegitimate since her father and mother never married) endured poverty and alienation. But all of this struggle lit a fierce fire in her belly, and she struck out on her own as a teenager in search of fame and fortune. This journey took her from radio star and film actress to the First Lady of Argentina. During her prime, she received both incredible admiration from the masses and criticism from the establishment. When she died at age 33 from cancer, she left behind a legacy that still haunts Argentina to this day.    The film features both amazing music and acting. There is wall-to-wall singing and very little spoken dialogue, but I didn't care since I have a deep love for music. However, people who don't care for musicals would obviously be advised to stay away. Antonio Banderas does a great job as the film's narrator Che. He displays great emotional intensity and adds an authentic Latin flavor to the role. And who knew he could sing that well? Jonathan Pryce is an appropriate Juan Peron: charismatic in his own way, but passive enough to stand back in awe of his powerful wife at times.     But the star of the show is clearly Madonna. She put her heart and soul into this role and, given her previously bad films, I was impressed. She clearly feels a connection to Evita, and both women have many similarities. They both lost one of their parents at a very young age, they both possess boundless ambition and strong will, they both received great adulation and scrutiny, etc, etc. I'm sure this was a big reason why the part fit Madonna like a glove. Also, Madonna is reportedly responsible for making Eva more dimensional, and therefore more realistic, than the stage version. Tim Rice wrote the musical with Mary Main's slanderous biography, The Woman With The Whip, as a main inspiration. Therefore, Eva was mainly portrayed as a ruthless power hungry tyrant in the play. Eva could be manipulative and domineering at times, but there was also a softer, warmer side to her that the movie version managed to show.     Besides her acting, Madonna's vocal range and quality also improved, compared to her earlier days as a \\"raw talent\\". Many complained that Madonna, a pop singer, didn't have the chops to tackle the role that Broadway singers Patti LuPone and Elaine Page played. Well, their voices have different objectives. Its all about context. Broadway singers are allowed to fill up the huge theaters with their huge voices. However, an operatic style would have been too overbearing for a film. A capable pop singer, with a less harsh and simpler style of singing, is much more appropriate for a movie. Plus, all of her experience as a music performer gave her the training to portray emotions convincingly through song. She manages to be alternately passionate (\\"A New Argentina\\", \\"Waltz for Che and Eva\\"), self-confident (\\"Rainbow High\\", \\"Buenos Aires\\") and vulnerable (\\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\", \\"You Must Love Me\\").      If you're a fan of Madonna, musicals, or want to learn about a fascinating historical figure, then buy this film. You'll love it.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|This album sucks.  Why would Chris Cornell belittle himself like this.  Working with Timberland??......If Cornell used the toilet he could drop some Timberlands, or Timberlake's.  Cornell doesn't need losers like Timberland.  When I saw the gay videos for this album it had me questioning Cornell's sexuality as he was posing like most \\"artists\\" in this style on soulless, talentless music.  I see Chris buying a new guitar real soon and doing a sham Soundgarden reunion to save face. If this is the direction he is taking, defiling his legacy and his fans and making himself look like a clown then his career is over.  One can only assume Chris got warned by fans and laughed at enough for this garbage that he wont do it again, then when he reforms soundgarden everyone will forget this pathetic crap, and praise their hero again.  The most retarded thing is Cornell saying \\"This is the best music I've done in my career\\" has he been deaf since the 80's or have drugs made him forget his Soundgarden or Audioslave days?!?!  That statement reguarding this album is repulsive and shows what a sellout he is.  He also stated that he didn't sellout with this horrid piece of dung, but reforming \\"an old band\\" in his mind would be selling out....  Soundgarden reforms 2010....there you go cornell is a joke as he always has been aparently.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I saw this film in the theatre when it first came out. It touched me deeply then and is a great film to review at times. It reminds us of the importance of the cross and the true sacrifice made for us by a loving God.
B001N18HO6|5.0|The best selling grunge album remastered with bonus tracks and collectibles is very well done indeed.  I wasen't sure what a remaster of Ten would sound like as the origional is perfect as is, which is also nice that an origional copy is included in this package.  The result is well put together and sounds great.  Highly recommended.
B00000IMTF|5.0|That's what this album is to me, in a word. One of the most intense records I have ever heard, hands down. Heavy metal as a genre was still in it's early stages when this was first released in 1976 and what a statement! This is, no doubt, one of the great metal classics of all time. I don't care what era you come from, if you love heavy music, this is an important album to experience. And I think it's important to point out too, at least from my experience, that this is a singular expressive thought/feeling coming from the band that is best heard as a unit and not just as a grouping of songs. I have this on my iPod but I would still prefer to hear the album the way it was intended, from start to finish. I love this record and am very proud to own it. Get it. You'll be glad you did.
031606792X|5.0|I would like to say a big thank you to Stephenie Meyer for writing these books and sharing these wonderful characters with us.     She has definitely brought back my love for fiction. Until I read her books, I wondered why I lost my interest in reading fiction for pleasure somewhere in the middle of my teens. I now realise that the fictional books that I was forced to read as I got older, although the characters were fictional, told stories that could happen in my non-fictional world, much like my life. As a person who enjoys getting myself lost in the author's imaginary world and escaping mine, the books I was reading lost their magic, because I no longer left my world.     The twilight series, has been such a delight to read because they have taken me so far away from my reality as a young adult just like the books used to, when I read as a child. It amazes me that people are so critical of this work when the author has brought in so much of our reality into a fictional world- things like child birth, dealing with the loss of a loved one, depression & making difficult choices and sacrificial love. Even though these things often never get happy endings in our reality, she has managed to tie it all together into a good happy ending. We don't get that in the world, and that's the point of fiction, when I want reality, I can read the paper or watch the news or just not read altogether.     I am also surprised by those people who won't read a great story because they just can't get past grammatical errors etc. Despite these errors, she has still been able to communicate and give us a good sense of her characters and their story, even though they weren't initially written for an audience.  It is such a shame to be so rude about this matter in reviews, when there is so much well written material that you can choose to analyse if your only aim is to build your grammar when you read. It would be better  to do that instead of writing these rude reviews.    I'm glad this book did not depress me, no-one died and I finished the book in a very happy place and it left me wanting more. My world is the opposite of this and the book has been a wonderful place to retreat.  I'm not sure why you read, but if you are like me and like to enjoy things that you really can't get in this world, then these books will be as delightful for you as they were for me.    I really hope she has more of the twilight world to share with us.  (This might sound silly but am I the only one that still wants to hear about Bella's life now that she's all grown up and powerful?)
B001GSV3EC|5.0|No matter how many times you hear Jeff play the same song it really doesn't matter because a true artist expresses themselves in the moment. Jeff has a voice on his guitar and that separates the special musicians from everyone else. I just saw him live down under in Brisbane on the 29th Jan 2009 and he essentially played the material on this album. It is a shame that his writing and arranging are so often overlooked as they deserve more credit.  This album is a compilation of some of Jeff's finest works and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I think Jeff is getting better as he ages and unlike many professional musicians Jeff maintains the integrity and quality in his work. His band as usual rounds out the sound with virtuosic drumming from Vinnie Colaiuta(used to love him when he played with Zappa). Vinnie just has a rolling light sound and has a vocabulary on the drums that is so varied it is hard to know where all those ideas keep spawning from. Tal Wilkenfeld on bass is excellent but I feel plays a little too softly at times, and Jason Rebello on keyboards has some outstanding solo moments. This is a complete album with no bad tracks. It is not really fair to single out any particular tracks but I like the slower tracks such as Cause We've Ended As Lovers, Nadia, Goodbye Pork Pie Hat / Bush With The Blues but Beck's Bolero and Scatterbrain are equally lifting. Music does not get much purer with great writing, melody, harmony, playing and arranging. It's all there. The thing with Jeff is you don't even notice his guitar playing you just hear the music. Enjoy :)
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Powerful action, hard Bond - where's the humor, the irony of past Bonds? Most of all, why isn't the 007 theme accompanying when Bond goes into action. In Casino Royale it came in at the end, when the familiar saying, \\"Bond, James Bond,\\" rolled off of Craig's tongue. I felt, since he was really now 007, that was a precursor to the music returning to his action sequences. But, alas, it wasn't.    When \\"Golden Eye\\" opened, fans crowded in to see \\"Remington Steel's\\" Pierce Brosnan become the new Bond, the theater audience actually cheered when he broke through the wall driving the tank, the Bond theme blasted away. Gone is the thrill.    And the opening title, why is it at the end? Someone dropped the ball. As a lifelong Bond fan, I felt cheated. The music, the humor, it's gone. As far as I'm concerned, so is Bond. I have seen every bond movie, including Sean Connery's return in \\"Never say Never\\" and the spoof of \\"Casino Royale\\" featuring, among others, David Niven and numerous Bonds on DVD.     I've added Daniel Craig's \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"Quantum of Solace, but I think the franchise is over. It's just another Borne look alike, fantastic stunts, but neither entertaining as Borne nor the past Bond's.    I miss the 007 formula.    Sad.
0393312836|5.0|When I started reading this book, I was inclined to put it down, because it didn't feel as something I would like. I'm glad I didn't, this is one of those classics that gets better with every read.    I know Russian language, but after first couple of chapters it was still hard to follow the 'nadsat' talk. 'Nadsat' is slang language invented by Burgess, it is a mixture of Russian and English. After You get used to this talk, it adds a lot to this book: it makes You think with both side of Your brain and follow more closely the text, because You're looking for clues what certain slang words mean. I think people who have given low mark because of the slang talk haven't given enough effort to read the book.    After reading the book, I also watched Kubricks movie and got the same initial impression as reading the paperpack, that I don't like it. Everything seemed so theater-like, artificial, but the more I got into the movie, the more I like it. It is a classic as is the book. They supplement each other nicely: the more You read the book or watch the movie, the more You want to do it again.
B001DUJNGS|3.0|This is a pretty good album by itself. Personally though, I didn't get the Enigma 'feel' out of this one. You remember Morphing Through Time and Child in Us? Those were and still are my favorite defining Enigma compositions. And I still listen to the older albums rather than the last 3 - which aren't bad, but a little too somber for my taste. I would still recommend that you buy this album.    This opinion also has something to do with me listening to the last 3 albums in the Winter because of their release later in the year. The gloomy climate gets linked to the always resonating Enigma albums.     As an aside, I think all Enigma albums need to be released during spring, right before summer, so people can associate the melodies with sunny skies.    Buy this one.
031606792X|2.0|Do you think it would be possible to have an alternate ending to this story? I think it would be similar to how most dvd movies come with alternate endings these days.     There are a few things that bother me about the last and final installment in the twilight series, but I will limit it to four things...     SPOILER ALERT*****       1. Bella and Edward not consummating their love with even a few details, no kissing, no caressing, nothing...extremely disappointing, especially after having been built up during the three previous books.     2. Bella being turned into a vampire in such a gruesome and unromantic way, it was just a bloodbath, how ironic...     3. Jacob imprinting on Renesme(what an awful name..) I realize that according to the custom, it is unavoidable, but how can you exclude the lovemaking scene between a married couple, but have a 17 year old love a newborn...I thought to myself, how odd..     4. The anticlimactic battle scene...Maybe from having read the Harry Potter books, I expected some type of epic battle, similar to Bella's dream where she ended up facing everyone on her own, I had expected her to have another talent that she was unaware of that would obliterate the competition, but it ended peacefully, I think that was even more upsetting that the previous reasons.     I wish that Ms. Meyer would have spent more time editing her story to make it end with something worthy of the beautiful characters she created in Twilight.  I found this website where some fans have satisfied the love scene portion and the battle: [...] You will not be disappointed.

B00000ITOY|5.0|I purchased this for my almost 2 year old daughter for Christmas! She has been playing with it for 4 months and absolutely loves it! She has gotten pretty quick at stacking up all the shapes and is so proud of herself for her accomplishment. She will sit for 20 minutes at a time just dumping them back over and restacking and has even started stacking them up in color order on each shape. It is very durable, and I plan on keeping it around for my grandkids someday!
B00005AAFS|5.0|I agree with those who say this is the best Rammstein album to date.  The sound is fully developed, rich and full in production values, and the songs are good from start to finish with some that are fabulous.  For me this will be the highest level of their musical achievement unless and until they impress with something new.  Do, though, look up the EMIGRATE album by Rammstein guitarist Richard Kruspe.  Very musical writing and great hooks.
B001PNVYMO|5.0|Yes the Pet Shop Boys are one of the very few bands that have delivered consistently good pop records for 25 years. And yes, Yes is one their best albums they have made in that time, dare I say it at least as good as Behaviour. There's great depth here, fantastic dance tracks, majestic melancholy and just brilliant pop music that fit almost as well into today's scene as it would have done 2 decades ago.    There's much for 80's music fans to love; the infectious Did You See Me Coming would not be out of place on a New Order record; Vulnerable could have been lifted straight off Behaviour, but equally Love etc and Pandemonium amongst others could have come at any point since. Amazingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, all the songs on Yes are excellent. My favourite track is King Of Rome, it has that Jealousy feel to it; melancholy in spades; Neil's haunting voice losing nothing in all this time.    20 years ago Yes would have hit the number 1 spot with ease, many of tracks would have got to number 1 in the singles chart too had they been released. Would that be the case now, I wish - where is quality today, so lacking in an \\"Idle\\" world?    This record deserves a wide audience. If you have not discovered the Pet Shop Boys start here and then buy Behaviour, then Please, Actually and Fundamental. You will be rewarded.    If you can grab the extraordinary 2CD limited edition Yes, etc. as it  seems to be disappearing fast. The bonus disc contains a brilliant duet of Neil and Philip Oakey on This Used To Be The Future - it's PSB meets Human League to brilliant effect.  The remaining dub versions of More Than A Dream (Magical dub), Pandemonium (Stars & Sun dub), The Way It Used To Be (Left of Love dub), All Over The World (This is a dub), Vulnerable (Public Eye dub) and Love etc. (Beautiful dub) are all outstanding.     For me the purchase of West End Girls at a record shop off Oxford Street back in the late 80's led to a journey around the world which lasted 20 years and continues today. Yes takes me back over that time, it is on my iPod now and I know I will play it repeatedly over the coming weeks and months.
031606792X|2.0|Break Dawn was torture for those of us who find it difficult to stop reading a book once we've started.  The characters that I fell in love with became so watered down from their introduction in Twilight.  The story line was SO lost in the author's attempt to write another \\"thick\\" book! I think Mrs. Meyer should have stopped with Twilight.
0738711500|5.0|I am so very happy with this deck!  It is absolutely beautiful, and it is very easy to read.  I am a novice and after reading the book that went along with it and doing some spreads I am already well on my way toward doing readings with confidence.  I got another type of deck as well as this one and I prefer this one MUCH more than the other. I would recommend this set to anyone starting out, as well as to tarot readers who do not have this set in their collection.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|I have never read Thomas Hardy's book of the same title, but my daughter and I did thoroughly enjoy the movie, which we had initially seen earlier this year on PBS/MPT.  The tragic story was very well portrayed by the actors, and we were especially impressed with Gemma Arterton, who played Tess.  The scenery was beautiful and lent itself to the overall quality and enjoyment of the film.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|This is a fun movie. Probably my favorite of the series, and  the most realistic!

0793518326|5.0|Well, you could go cheaper, but for around 50 bucks you can have the works. This is a common complaint but if you grew up with the Beatles like me, you're going to need your glasses. I'm to the point that I have to enlarge a page on my copier. But otherwise, I think it was a great may to spend my birthday Amazon gift card.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD a few weeks ago, and I really like it! For starters, I love Amy Lee's singing voice! It's beautiful, awesome, sexy, and scary all together! My favorite songs so far are Going Under, and Bring Me To Life! I highly recommend FALLEN!!!
031606792X|2.0|Not as \\"good\\" as \\"Eclipse,\\", nor as \\"bad\\" as \\"New Moon.\\"    I suppose my main complaint about this book is that it drags on and on. While there is plenty of conflict or approaching conflict, none of it feels particularly threatening, or even interesting.     Part of this may well be because the events are very similar to scenes and events from vampire tales such as \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" and were much more emotionally charged and engaging in their previous incarnations.    Part of it is simply the literary style and voice of \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" which reads very much like a journal detailing the rather uneventful days of a rather average young woman finally figuring out how to find a place for herself in her family and--to a very limited extent--within her society. While many compelling books have written around that very concept, this is not one of them.    I would place the blame for this book's lack of interest squarely on the shoulders of its narrating protagonist. If she had depth, color, complexity, intelligence or wit, then the book might as well.    In point of fact, the center section of this book is narrated by Jake instead of Bella, and it reads much more smoothly and engagingly than the rest of the novel (and is the reason why this rates 2 1/2 stars instead of a mere 2 or possible 1 1/2. Of course I had to give the book 2 stars as Amazon doesn't allow half ratings).     If the series had been narrated by Jake (or even another charcter), the series might conceivably have reached a quality worth of all the hype that has accompanied it.     Jake's narration holds considerably more elements of a traditional coming of age novel, and--as scenes concerning Jake throughout the series have done, Jake's narration seems to hint at elements of both \\"The Outsiders\\" and \\"Catcher in the Rye\\"--and possibly of \\"Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" as well. None of these is completely developed, but that may actually be a good thing, as it keeps the resemblance tantalizing and interesting instead of outrageous, spoofy, or flat--such as the outright references to \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights\\" do in the earlier books narrated by Bella.     I would advise readers simply to read Jake's third and skip the rest of the book, however, I admit a certain lack of closure would be somewhat frustrating.    Bella's ending third of the book is simply drawn-out and bland while the first third is bland as well as carrying the annoying and irritating traits many readers have come to expect of Bella.    I would suggest skipping the first third of the book, reading Jake's third, and skimming through Bella's closing third, perhaps really reading the last 20-50 pages a bit more closely than the rest.    A disappointing end to a disappointing series. I suppose there is something fitting in that.

B0000DENTV|5.0|This is one of those rock albums in which i grew up with. Along with Third Eye Blind and Staind and many others, I enjoyed it as much as other listeners did. \\"Take a Picture\\" may be a bit overrated nowadays, but the lyrics and music are still catchy. \\"Captain Bligh,\\" \\"Welcome to the Fold,\\" and \\"It's Gonna Kill Me\\" are some of the heavier songs; they're just too good to avoid. I didn't enjoy \\"I Will Lead You\\" and \\"I'm Not the Only One\\" as much, but they're decent enough. The closer \\"Miss Blue\\" has the same soft and mellow tone that \\"Take a Picture\\" conveys, and I truly believe that this is the perfect conclusion to the album. In short this is a great, but not excellent, CD that's way too under-appreciated in this generation. I can't understand why, though.<br /><br />Grade: A-

031606792X|5.0|For an amateur writer I think Stephanie Meyer is very good. I love the ending of this book. Just how I'd like it to be. Bella and Edward married. Bella got a daughter. A brave symbol of her love for edward carrying it in her human form when she could have just had aborted it. The daughter named Renesmee or Nessie sounds very cute, She grows faster than normal humans includes mentally ofcourse otherwise she's gonna be a retard but I was thinking maybe that when she reaches like 15 or 16 years old, her age would stop right there and she would be 15 or 16 forever.  When Bella delivered the Immortal baby Nessie, Bella's supposed to die because her human body isn't strong enough to deliver that child  but Edward saved her by turning her into a vampire and I'm so glad that he did otherwise It would be a sad ending if she died. At least they're together, bella a new vampire herself as part of the cullen family and nessie too. In the End Bella's gift is a \\"shield\\", protecting people she loves around her. She have a very good self restraint as a vampire especially for human blood and She became Immortally Beautiful and Strong. Edward doesn't have to protect her from accidents and death threats anymore but ofcourse they still look out for each other.  Speaking about Jacob I really like his character, He's like someone you can run off with anywhere anytime, easy going, very happy to be with. I like how Jacob in this last book became friends with the cullens, and the idea that in the end Jacob and Nessie would be together too. Well Nessie would keep growing until she's like 16 and 'coz Jacob will be 16 as longer as he wants to be wolf I think they're meant to be together and my 2 cents, that when Jacob stops being a wolf and would age I wonder if Nessie can turn him into a vampire. hm I wonder... This book is actually one of those stories created from wild fantasies though impossible to happen in real life but whatever, it's just a book. very good though.
B001CKU79Q|1.0|I'm just not getting the point of this release, all it really does is exactly REPLICATE and imitate the original Miles/Gil Evans album \\"Sketches of Spain\\" note-for-note, sound for sound. It adds NOTHING new or even tries to INTERPRET as opposed to simply copy and replicate. It can't be faulted for the musicianship (it's flawless) but there's just no point to this. It's NOT what jazz is about. PASS
B000RJO57I|5.0|You need a wicked sense of humour to appreciate this, good job I've got one. It's superb.
B00004T9AO|4.0|Crisis being Oldfield's 1983 release and his 8th album and contains the well known track \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" which is such a great track. Other great tracks are \\"Shadow on the Wall\\", and \\"In High Places\\". The main track sounds like a bit like Jean Michel Jarre and Kraftwerk and is very experimental. We get some great linernotes but no lyrics but a list of whom plays what on each track. The cover is quite odd but I like the photo of Oldfield in the booklet. 4/5.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|DOUBT succeeds on every level - from the fine transference of Patrick Shanley's play to the screen (Shanley wrote the play, the screenplay, and directs) to the atmospheric cinematography excursion through the Bronx of the mid 1960s to the detailed delineation of the characters by Meryl Streep, Viola Davis, Amy Adams, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and even young Joseph Foster, to the careful editing.  It would be difficult to imagine a finer cast, here cast in roles counter to their usual types, bringing such power to the poetry of Shanley's lines.<br /><br />The story is well known by now (the dismissal of a progressive priest by a crotchety old Catholic school principal over a false rumor and all the 'doubt ' that brings into play in every character), but multiple viewings of this film intensify the humanity of each of the characters and demonstrate just how fine a writer Shanley is. The subject matter is difficult at first but the manner in which each of these superb actors (under the guidance of Shanley's direction) explore the effects of spite and loathing and forgiveness shares some of the finest ensemble acting in years. Recommended.  Grady Harp, April 09
0385338600|4.0|Having read most of Grishams work and seen some of the movies as well I came to this book quite late and as many of the other reviewers have commented, I didn't realise this was his first. In some ways I am pleased to have come to this late as I had felt that he had lost his way a litle over the years and this book is simply very strong and compelling. Covering the tough subject that it does, and tackling some hard and harsh storylines it was a pageturner from start to finish and despite some ocmments that the detail was a little deep, that's what you get from Grisham. Its restored my faith in Grishams work and I'll be back to buying his new releases again.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves this movie!  It became an instant hit-- she loves the songs and the animals.  I love how I don't have to fast forward through any \\"scary parts\\" like we have to do with many Disney movies.  There just aren't any really scary parts in this movie (as opposed to the Disney \\"princess\\" movies.  Another good Disney animated movie without scary parts is Robin Hood.) I also love the bonus feature where you can play all the song segments from the movie, because the music is really fun in this film and the songs are truly her favorite part.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|On an Island being Gilmour's 2006 release and his 3rd studio album and did very well in the charts reaching #1 in the UK albums chart and #6 in the Billboard 200. Even so I only find this album to be ok. Compared to other Pink Floyd albums it falls a bit flat. That is not to say that this is a bad album. The cd booklet contains all the lyrics, and a list of whom plays what on every track. 3/5.
B001KL3GY0|4.0|Some of the songs here are catchy and the variety that is provided on this album is an added bonus.  It is very tough to give an album five stars, so I think my four star rating is fair and I recommend and will do the same myself in listening to the older albums to see the progression of their music.
B001MYIXAW|4.0|While I am aware of the overblown furor regarding the subtitles, I feel that people may be getting the wrong idea and avoiding this disc.  There are a few scenes where some small snippets of dialog are left untranslated.  That much is true.  But this does NOT fatally damage the experience of watching this movie, nor dampen its impact cinematically.  This is an AMAZING, entertaining film, and well worth owning, despite ravings to the contrary.  I did not know about this controversy when I watched the Blu-ray last night, and while it was obvious to me that some lines were untranslated, this in no way impeded my enjoyment of the movie.  There are some things about the story that aren't made obvious even in the Swedish dialog, and are left to the audience to understand purely from visual and other clues - this is a thinking person's vampire movie.  I can just imagine what the American remake will do to screw THAT up.
0151008116|5.0|One of the greatest stories I've read. I didn't really see so much of the philosophical and religious themes as others but the psychological aspects of memory are arresting at the end of the book. The story alone is phenomenal--well-written and beautifully told.
B001PA65VC|5.0|I am very critical when it comes to music. I listen to a lot of electronic music and Prodigy nailed it with this. You'll probably only gonna enjoy the first 5 songs on this album though. The rest is not as vanguard. But Prodigy definitely proved with this record that they are still the only ones in the Western Hemisphere who are abled to be PunkElectro (there you got the genre ;)). But in fact, this rcord proves again that Prodigy are so unique that they might really have created their own Genre.    Way better than Always outnumbered, never outgunned, and the first 5 tracks are just as good as the whole \\"Fat of the Land\\" album. Strongly recommended. Prodigy is back. Fresh as ever.
B00005JPNY|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!  SUPERB DIGITAL GRAPHICS OF ANIMALS.  ACTORS WELL-KNOWN AND DO A FANTASTIC JOB.  GOOD STORY LINE. CAN'T WAIT FOR MOVIE #2 SEQUEL AND THEN #3 AS IN THE BOOK SERIES.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|A while ago I remember this movie being hyped pretty badly, about how great it was going to be.  Finally got an opportunity to see it the other night at a friend's house and... it was okay.  The biggest strength for the movie was the whole camcorder viewpoint thing and it's also what makes it such a pain to watch.  It's shaky, you'll end up looking at peoples' shoes, and the guy holding it comes off as a buffoon.  He gives his stupid little comments through the whole movie.  The monster is big and weird-looking enough, but there's no reason given.  Just shows up and starts knocking over buildings.  Even at the (subpar) finale, theres no insight given, no direction.    The characters aren't interesting, they're all just the same yahoos.  And the first twenty or so minutes of the movie are you being forced to watch a bunch of teen drama coming from twenty-somethings that's supposed to show some insight into the people you're supposed to care about, but it fails and is just boring.    So far I've said nothing good about the movie, so I, too, am wondering why I gave it three stars.  Well, it's not terrible or anything, it's just not at all good.  There are plenty of worse ways to spend an afternoon, but... rent it, don't buy it.  You probably wouldn't want to see it twice.
B0018R4JJC|4.0|Dance of Death is superb!  It was the album that got me back into Maiden.  I'd been a fan in the mid-80s, but my interest waned during the 90s.  But the title track, along with \\"Pachendale,\\" \\"Wildest Dreams,\\" \\"Rainmaker,\\" and \\"No More Lies,\\" make this album excellent.<br /><br />Let me be honest: I stole this album online.  But it was so damn good, I felt I needed to be upright and went to a store and bought the CD.  The title track alone is amazing.  Consider it \\"Number of the Beast Part II.\\"  It tells a story of a scary adventure.  Like many IM tracks, it starts slow, but then explodes in a frenzy of melody and pulsating rhythm.  Simply amazing.<br /><br />And Pashendale?  Again, a sister to \\"The Trooper.\\"  This track really takes you into the trenches of WWI.  Tremendous.<br /><br />The heaviest track, \\"Monts&eacute;gur,\\" is superb.  Heavy, heavy, heavy.  But with typical Maiden melody and lyrical depth.<br /><br />The only reason I gave the album 4 stars instead of 5 is \\"Gates of Tomorrow.\\"  Pretty weak.<br /><br />I don't understand people who've written saying IM's latest havn't been very good.  \\"Dance of Death\\" got me back into serious, melodic heavy metal. I've since discovered HammerFall, Iced Earth, and other great bands that have come about since Grunge destroyed 80s metal.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I'm a huge KISS fan.  Gotta throw that in!
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater said this was a top 10 pick for the year. I don't have any Metallica albums so I asked for it for my birthday.    The sound is HORRIBLE. Whoever decided to mix it this way should be put in jail. Like another reviewer said, compare this to \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" by Porcupine Tree, which has superb sound, think how much better this album would be if it sounded good.    Atrocious. Inexcusable. Totally ruins this album for me. (And I was inclined to take Mike seriously. I wanted to love this album, I really did....)
1594481717|4.0|Some of Pink's idea's are out there (like labyrinths), but we all need to think more with both sides of the brain.

0446402397|3.0|I'm not typically a reader of \\"thrillers,\\" although I don't know why because I usually find them quite entertaining. Child 44 was the first I've read in a long while, and definitely didn't disappoint. I don't want to say it was educational for me about Stalinist Russia, because, as I said, it's a thriller and so I can't really expect everything in it to be 100% factual, but...it was. I'd never really put myself in the perspective of someone who lived in such a world, and oh boy did it sound brutal, and terrifying. All I could think through much of the book was, \\"People really lived like this?\\" and \\"How did they not revolt against this?\\" But, of course, history tells us that people will live for centuries suffering incredible injustices and brutality. I can't say it didn't make me feel incredibly lucky.<br /><br />Child 44 follows Leo, a somewhat high-ranking member of the MGB during the height of Stalinist Russia. His job involves arresting \\"traitors\\" to the country, who, as we know now, were usually just innocent people trying to survive, accused of crimes they never committed and sentenced to the Gulags or death.  A concept promoted by the communists was that crime didn't exist in Russia, because  everyone has the same possessions (in itself a lie, considering the higher ranking you were in the government, the better housing you got, not to mention access to better clothes and food) so there is no need for crime. Leo's boss tells him to go speak with a coworker whose child was recently killed in a \\"tragic accident\\" while the child was playing by the train tracks. The coworker and his family believe their child was murdered, and claim a witness saw the child walking and holding hands with a strange man shortly before he was killed. Leo must convince the family to stop their requests for investigation--after all, there is no crime in Stalinist Russia, so no one could have killed their son. It was clearly a tragic train accident.  While Leo views this current assignment as an annoyance and a distraction from his current surveillance of a potential enemy of the state, it winds up having far-reaching consequences for him. When Leo's wife is accused of being a spy, and the couple is sent away in disgrace to toil at a remote factory village, Leo discovers that other children all throughout Russia have been killed in a similar fashion as his former coworker's child. The discovery--coupled with the false implication of his wife--causes Leo to lose faith in the Russian government, and sets him on a course to discover the serial killer. But he has to act before government officials discover what he's doing and arrest him for treason.<br /><br />The biggest complaint about this book is the \\"twist\\" ending, and I can't say I disagree--it's kinda lame. And it felt relatively unnecessary. I was satisfied with Smith's brutal look at Stalinist Russia, and the story of a high-ranking MGB official who loses his faith in communism while investigating a serial killer who the government wants to pretend doesn't exist.  I didn't need the extra \\"connection\\" thrown in by the twist. But, that said, the twist only comes at the very end, while the rest of the story is quite good. As a thriller, it did its job--I was excited to read the book every night; the chapters flew by, the action was mostly fast-paced and it was difficult to put down.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wanted an entertaining, if very dark, read.an annoyance and a distraction from his current surveillance of a potential enemy of the state, it winds up having far-reaching consequences for him.

0385512058|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a buddy of mine in sales.  We attend the same lead sharing group. It is an interesting read with many practical examples. I absorbed the information quickly and set out to eagerly put its advice to use in my day-to-day business and personal dealings.<br /><br />The author Keith Ferrazzi, is NOT promoting two-faced, self-serving brown nosing in order to further your agenda. He is recommending we develop skills for improving our ability to connect with people, gain their trust, and improve our ability to infuence and lead them.<br /><br />The book has advice on how to work a networking event, how to leave a more lasting impression on people, and how to effectively follow up with people so they remember you and your message. The objective according to him is to benefit everyone making sure no one feels like they have been duped.<br /><br />The book is appropriate for anyone from the shy and socially awkward to the naturally outgoing and charismatic. If you need to make the best use of your circle of contacts for landing that next job, deal, or whatever, this book is a good additional to your reading list

B001R4MEYS|5.0|Mastodon's latest album, Crack the Skye, is easily one of their best works to date, and possibly the best album of the year. I know it's really early in the year, but I feel pretty safe in saying that there might not be a metal album better than this for the rest of the year.<br /><br />I don't think it's fair to compare this album to their other works because all their stuff is so different. I personally love the fact that they have evolved so much. Crack the Skye is possibly the most radical change of all but they execute this change in a masterful way.<br /><br />After I listened to the whole album in one sitting, I was blown away. This album is very progressive, but not in an annoying way. Here's what I mean by that: My friend recently turned me on to a band called Between the Buried and Me. They are a great prog metal band, but I find myself constantly asking him \\"Which song is playing now?\\" because each of their songs has several very dramatic and abrupt style changes that makes it sound like a completely different song all together. That's not a bad thing, but the change is so abrupt that it tends to get kind of annoying at times. What makes this album different are the amazing transitions. I don't really know how to put it into words, but the songs seem to sort of build up to the next sound. The best way to understand this is to just listen to track four, \\"The Czar\\", which I consider Mastodon's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". This track is broken up into four distinct parts, but it's easy to tell when the whole track is complete.<br /><br />Speaking of \\"The Czar\\" reminds me this album has so much groove. Once you have listened to this classic from start to finish, this album will find a home in your car's CD player for months to come. I think the greatest compliment I can give this album, is in the fact that in all the times I have listened to it (around 20+ times) I have not skipped a single song. Ever. Every single song on this album is amazing and you will find it hard to skip over any of them even on multiple listens.<br /><br />I can't find a fault with this album. The riffs are amazing. The guitars sound amazing. The vocals are beautifully eerie, and the drums (Brann Dailor is one of my favorite drummers) plays a big part in creating the unique sound in this album.<br /><br />Overall, I am very proud to place this album on my shelf next to masterpieces such as Leviathan, Blood Mountain, and Remission.of them even on multiple listens.

B00006GO99|5.0|In a way, this disc was my first introduction to the music of Thelonius Monk and of course his most successful album to date thanks to the people at Columbia Records who also paved the way to Monk's popularity (he made the cover of Time that year).  From the title track, one feels the joy of his being in the music and he's ably supported by long time tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse, bassist John Ore and drummer Frankie Dunlap.  If you ever feel blue, this disc will pick you and of course, the newly remastered CD version also has four extra tracks too!!  After listening to this great album I recommend also checking out Monk's earlier albums on Riverside as well.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Sometimes a revival of a musical form, like the \\"talking blues\\", that highlighted the urban folk revival of the early 1960's is driven by a social need. In that case it was to provide a format for the \\"glad tidings\\" that a new political and social movement was a-bornin'. In the case of the revival several years ago of what is called \\"mountain music\\" it was the films \\"The Song Catcher\\" and, more importantly, the very popular movie starring George Clooney \\" O Brother, Where Art Thou?' The CD under review is a compilation of music from that movie, a not unnatural tie-in in the modern entertainment business. The movie deserves a separate review, however, this CD can stand on its own as a very nice cross section of \\"mountain music\\", some familiar most not so.    Without straining credulity \\"mountain music\\" is the music of the simple folk of Appalachia, those who worked  hard in the coal mines, on the hard scrabble farms and in the isolated mills of the region. This was their Saturday night entertainment and with the advent of radio was a unifying cultural experience. The songs \\"speak\\" of hard and lonely lives, the beauty of the then pristine countryside, the usual vagaries of love and lost and the mysterious ways of a very personal, if arbitrary, god. Throw in a few upbeat tunes reflecting the love of \\"corn\\" liquor, women and the sometimes funny side of coping with life's trials and tribulations and you have the mountain version of the folk experience.  Sound familiar? Sure it does, except, it is done with simple guitar, a blazing fiddle and, hopefully a full-bodied mandolin.    Here you have all the above types of songs mentioned above in one spot. The cadence of the work in hard prison life gets a nod in \\"Po Lazarus\\". The hobo's national anthem (Great Depression era version) \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" is also here. The vagaries of love get spelled out in \\"Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby\\". For uplift try the one everyone knows- \\"You Are My Sunshine\\". Norman Blake, worthy of a separate review of his own as a master of mountain music, provides a very rich instrumental \\"A Man Of Constant Sorrow\\". Finally, no recent compilation of mountain music is complete without Ralph Stanley's eerie \\"O Death\\" and \\"Angel Band\\". If you need a primer for learning about mountain music here you are.

B000IFS0HM|5.0|Frank McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes\\" is probably the easiest review that I have had to write since I have been doing such reviews in this space. Why? Frank McCourt's book of childhood memoirs is my story. No, not in the details of his life's story, or mine. But rather in how being Irish, being poor and being uprooted affects your childhood, and later. And those traumas, for good or evil, cross generational lines. McCourt, we are told as his story unfolds, was born in America of immigrants of the Diaspora after Irish independence who, for one reason or another, returned to the old country in defeat in the 1930's. As McCourt notes right at the beginning, that fact in itself provides a rather ironic twist if one is familiar with Irish history (at least until very recently). He is, in any case, thus a child of the Great Depression and World War II, the generation of my parents, as it was refracted through Ireland during that period. I, on the other hand, am a child of the 1960's, the \\"Generation of `68\\" here in America born of the dreaded Irish Catholic-English Protestant combination- and raised in an Irish Catholic enclave. Nevertheless the pages of this memoir are filled to the brim with the results of the emotional (and sometimes physical scars) of being \\"shanty\\" Irish in this world that hit home to this reader.      That said, we did not share the terrible effect that \\"the drink\\" had on creating his dysfunctional family with his father's, Malachy McCourt, crazed need for the alcohol cure to drown his sorrows and his bitterness and the fact that his great moment in life was his bit for \\"the cause\\" (of Irish independence). A familiar story in the Irish community here and in the old country but my father seldom drank, although he too was constantly out of work and shared with Frank's father that same bitterness about his fate.  He was uneducated, lacking in skills and prospects and as a \\"hillbilly\\" Protestant Southerner from coal country down in Kentucky. Thus, an `outsider' like Frank's father. That is the commonality that caught my eye (and sometimes my throat) as I read of Frank's youthful trials, tribulations and adventures. McCourt's ability to tap into that \\"mystical\\" something is what makes this a fine read, whether you are Irish or not.    Throughout the book McCourt's woe begotten but fatally prideful father is constantly referred to in the Irishtown working class poor ghetto of Limerick (and elsewhere, as well, but the heart of the story is told from there) as having an odd manner. This reflects a certain clannishness against those from the North of Ireland (Dare I say it, then area the known as Ulster) and a sneaking suspicion amount that crowd of some alien (meaning English Protestant) heritage. As the book progresses that odd trait is transferred (by heredity?) to Frank in his various wanderings, enterprise and desires. What joins us together then is that odd manner that gets repeatedly invoked throughout the book. Frank survived to tell the tale. As did I. But in both cases it appears to have been a near thing.    There is more that unites us. The shame culture, not an exclusive Irish Catholic property but very strong nevertheless, drilled in by the clannishness, the closeness of neighbors, the Catholic religion and by the bloody outsiders- usually but not always Protestants of some sort (as least for blame purposes- you know, the eight hundred years of British tyranny although very real to be sure).  All driven by not having nearly enough of this world's goods.  Every time I read a passage about the lack of food, the quality of the food, the conditions of the various tenements that the McCourt family lived in, the lack of adequate and clean clothing I cringed at the thoughts from my own childhood. Or the various times when the family was seriously down and out and his mother, the beloved Angela of the title, had to beg charity of one form or another from some institution that existed mainly to berate the poor. I can remember own my mother's plaintive cry when my brothers and I misbehaved that the next step was the county poor farm.     And how about the false pride and skewed order of priorities? Frank's father was a flat out drunk and was totally irresponsible. From a child's perspective, however, he is still your dad and must be given the respect accordingly, especially against the viciousness of the outside world. But life's disappointments for the father also get reflected in the expectations for the son. The dreams are smaller. Here, the horizons are pretty small when a governmental job with its security just above the \\"dole\\" is the touchstone of respectability. Sean O'Casey was able to make enduring plays from the slums of Dublin out of this material. And Frank McCourt enduring literature. Thanks, brother.      Note: The movie version of \\"Angela's Ashes\\" pretty fairly reflects the intentions of Frank McCourt in his childhood memoirs and follows the book accordingly, without the usual dramatic embellishments of that medium. The story line is so strong it needs no such \\"touch-ups\\". Particularly compelling is the very visual sense of utter poverty down at the base of Irish society in Frank McCourt's childhood.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is an opera lover's sacred dream. Three operas stars, an open air theatre, a symphony orchestra playing some of the most gorgeous music on the planet - this DVD is one step closer to paradise.<br /><br />My soul is still smiling after watching this disc. If only to have been there, in person, in Berlin on the evening this concert was filmed. The air must have been electric.<br /><br />The three singers: Domingo, Netrebko and Villazon. Each performed as if inspired by the gods of opera. The energy, the eros, the passion. Netrebko is both beautiful to hear and look upon. Her rendition o f \\"O mio babbiono caro\\" is breathtaking as is \\"Quendo men vo\\". Villazon shines with Domingo in the Bizet duet from The Pearl Fishers. The duet in Otello with Domingo and Netrebko is breathtaking.<br /><br />Actually, I have nothing but more and more praise for this DVD. I loved hearing the Intermezzo from Cavelleria rusticana. I loved all of it. Just beautiful.
B001R7IHA0|4.0|Keith Urban's \\"Defying Gravity\\" sounds pretty much like his last couple of records.  His songs are catchy with punchy hooks, some searing guitar & his great vocals on pitch.  I kept flashing on Rodney Crowell when listening to his singing.  When he tries to be sincere, he borders on schmaltzy for me like on \\"Only You Can Love Me This Way\\" and the closer \\"Thank You.\\"  But there are enough strong tracks here that it is well worth listening.  Of my three favorite tracks, \\"Standing Right in Front of You\\" has a bright melody with its upbeat lyric, \\"If you're looking for love, I'm standing right in front of you.\\"  \\"Why's It Feel So Long\\" has plenty of bounce per ounce with Eric Darken's percussion sending toes into a chronic tap.  \\"Sweet Thing\\" thumps delightfully with words coming a mile a minute, \\"The moon is high & the night is young; Come on & meet me under the cottonwood tree.\\"  Although not perfect and a bit too similar to the past, \\"Defying Gravity\\" is a strong set.  Enjoy!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|This is an amazing film in every way. From start to end, a dazzling experience.<br /><br />We all know the story: Benjamin Button is born as a monstrous, ugly baby. As he grown into a child, we see he is not just ugly. He is 80 years old... and aging backwards. At the same time the love of his life, Daisy, is growing up to become a world class dancer. As they both grow, their lives and experiences drive them apart... until they meet later in mid life, where they finally experience the same maturity. But obviously, as the aging process keeps its course, they must part again.<br /><br />Thematically, this is a subtle tale of two people in love who are destined to meet again and look after each other even being in different stages of their lives. Or a story of a love that must be tested to the extreme.<br /><br />But this is just one of the film's triumph. Visually, the film is striking as we see Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett getting younger and older with amazing special effects. That element alone is an experience that deserves to be seen.<br /><br />This film boosts every production value you can think of and even those who do not like the genre or the themes must admit this is an amazing accomplishment.<br /><br />The cast is superb. Brad and Cate are just the tip of an impressive row of great actors: Tilda Swinton (always astonishing), Julia Ormond, Elias Koteas, Jason Flemyng and the amazing Taraji P. Henson as Queenie, the woman who runs a nursing home and decides to take young Benjamin left at her doorsteps.<br /><br />There are several thematic points of encounter between this film and [[ASIN:B00003CXA2 Forrest Gump]] and they are pretty clear if you think both films were written by the same screenwriter (Eric Roth). But the universe of these stories is very similar and those thematic points are unavoidable: the lone character that goes thorough life alone, the moments of happiness that cannot last and the many ways the world turns bringing two people together or away from each other.<br /><br />STILL, this film is a winner in its own right and deserves the attention of any one who's looking for something different and amazing.

B00005JN8Z|5.0|The last time I saw \\"Quo Vadis\\" on TV (so long ago I can't remember exactly when it was), they edited out the one crucial scene from which the movie gets its name! Finally, here it is in all its glory. Beautifully done on DVD. The supplemental material is interesting and adds another dimension to this movie and how it fits into Biblical epics on films.
B001NFNFNA|4.0|I avoided seeing The Changeling in theaters mainly because the story didn't really interest me (or so I thought). Being a fan of Clint Eastwood and after reading all the glowing reviews I went ahead and rented it. While the pacing is slow at times, I never lost interest. If you make it past the first 1/3, things start picking up in a big way. The entire cast is excellent and the acting is what really gives this film it's jolt of life. Angelina Jolie turns in one of her best performances, but it's not just her, because everyone fits into place and delivers the goods. The set design and costumes are also top notch and really transport you to 1928. It's hard to believe something like this actually happened to this poor woman, but she doesn't go down without a fight and because of her courage we have this well made mystery from Clint. If only there was such a thing as DNA testing 81 years ago.
0385512058|4.0|Calling Keith Ferrazzi obsessive about social networking would probably be an extreme understatement.  I got worn out just reading about his efforts.  What saves this book is Ferrazzi's open acknowledgment that not everyone is willing to be as totally overboard as he is.  This book does contain a few useful, and obviously well tried out networking techniques.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|I dont think i need to write another review. It's terminator 2! if you havent seen or heard of this movie then you must not be into action movies or was too young to see it back then. It's the classic 90's film with better video and audio quality than the regular dvd. Buy it!
B001F12J0C|5.0|\\"The Bourne Trilogy\\" captures each of the three Jason Bourne action thrillers in one package full of first rate action entertainment.  Loosely based on three novels by Robert Ludlum, this trilogy focuses on amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne, on the run from mysterious enemies and looking for the key to his missing past.  Matt Damon is absolutely superb in what has become an intensely physical but emotionally understated signature role as Jason Bourne.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\" introduces Jason Bourne as a wounded man found floating in the Mediterranean.  Rescued by a fishing boat, the amnesiac young man is sent on to a bank in Zurich, based on an account number found implanted in a capsule under his skin.  Along the way to Zurich, Bourne discovers he has lethal fighting skills, which become essential to his survival when his appearance at the bank triggers a manhunt by the CIA.  Bourne will have to run for his life, accompanied by an attractive German drifter played by Franka Potente.<br /><br />In \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", Jason Bourne is hiding in India with his girlfriend from the first movie.  He struggles with unclear memories of his life as an assassin.  When Bourne is framed for a murder in Berlin, the CIA and a mysterious Russian oil magnate take up lethal pursuit.  Bourne must return to Europe for a fateful confrontation with his pursuers and with his past.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" picks up Jason Bourne where the last movie left him, wounded, on the run in Russia, and suffering flashbacks of his indoctrination as an assassin.  A journalist provides a clue to the program that created him and Bourne will race the CIA to his starting point in New York, hounded by fellow CIA assassins.<br /><br />Joan Allen has a recurring role as a sympathetic CIA official who is a sometime ally in Bourne's quest for his identity.  Julia Styles also has a recurring role as a CIA logistician who figured in Bourne's original assignment.  Top notch casts fill out each of the three stories.  The movies themselves were filmed in a jagged, sometimes grainy, and always fast-moving cinematic style, full of stunts and carried by Jason Bourne's uncanny instincts for coping with any situation.  If the respective plots have a few logic holes, the action moves fast enough through a series of exotic locations to more than distract the viewer.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Trilogy\\" is very highly recommended as first rate entertainment for modern fans of the spy genre.movies themselves were filmed in a jagged, sometimes grainy, and always fast-moving cinematic style, full of stunts and carried by Jason Bourne's uncanny instincts for coping with any situation.

B00005JPLW|5.0|The story of the three hundred Spartans is not the oldest legend originating from Greece, but is certainly the most famous. Although, Hollywood already had one version in 1962, it's but a shadow of, \\" 300 \\". Seeing the original and then watching this update, viewers will immediately see the difference. The first is candy coated and offered to entertain audiences holding a box of popcorn. This movie with it's spectacular visual panorama, violent action scenes and overall dramatic effects, will cause you to hold your breath. Gerard Butler, is impressive as King Leonidas. Dominic West as Theron and Vincent Regan as the Captain. Rodrigo Santoro is Xerxes, in modern gang attire and jewelry. This film may have originated in comic pages, but it explodes on the silver screen as iconic art. This version is sure to inspire some to visit the site of the heroic last stand, but may also inspire others to delve into the history books. On that note, there are minor historical mistakes, such as the Spartan king demeaning the Atheans as boy-lovers (which law allowed) but in fact, it was Spartan culture which habitually practice pederasty. Another literary goof, was the use of War-rhinos, elephants and mutants. One in particular which bothered me was the Greek traitor 'Ephialtes' as having been deformed. No historical reference to that. The idea of single Spartan fathers training their sons individually goes against traditional schooling in military academies. One last criticism. The Spartans claimed they fought for freedom and stated the Persian king was a tyrant. Any history book on Sparta, will illuminate the fact, Sparta used Helots as Slaves. Nevertheless, if you don't mind, these and a few other inaccuracies, the film will astonish you with its movie magic and I predict, will imprint itself as a Classic. *****
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|Lots of great songs, that haven't been overplayed by the radio. I have listened to it a million plus times.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I've seen this film before on vhs, and as well on dvd, but nothing compares to the awesome quality on this blu ray disc. its like i've never seen it before all over again. the detail of the imagery and the clarity of the sound blows away any of the previous releases. i caught myself noticing things i've never seen before with this blu ray release, even though i have seen this film about 10 times. it is a must have for any collection, and can be appreciated by all !
B00005JPY2|5.0|I found this movie an extremly thought-provoking movie. Much like the grafic novel. It has the gore and main plot but alot was left out. In all I'd recommend reading the book first than seeing the movie. They are both fantastic though.

B001NERPHS|5.0|I don't know what to say except to wonder if the other reviewers actually have listened to this remastering.<br /><br />This is it this is a brilliant remastering. It doesn't sound anything like the older release of this material.(I mean the commercial release, not the illegal bootleg)It is incredible, it blows my mind, hey  not all of us are comfortable buying illegal bootlegs and then swearing they are superior...this is great great stuff.<br /><br />I am sure I will be pitied by folks who write this off based on the awful earlier release of the basement tapes and have not listened to this remastering, tough, life is tough, you don't hear this. you don't even have a best friend....<br /><br />love love love love love this release

B001CIPU3G|5.0|Trivium have long been a band criticized by a good portion of the metal world as being Metallica fan boys trying to be rock stars. I myself don't think that, I could tell these guys had talent but I felt each release was simply held back, now it seems my instinct may have been correct. Shogun is far from being the most amazing album to come out over the course the past couple years, but it is Trivium's strongest showing yet.<br /><br />Right off the bat comes (in my opinion) the albums best track with the addictive \\"Kirisute Gomen\\". By far one of the best openers I have heard in a long while, from the tranquil acoustic beginning to the pummeling bride and the catchy chorus this song has it all. I was blown away by this track and figured it would be the one decent track on the album but then the tracks went by and still I was interested, I take back anything negative I may have said in the past about these guys and humbly ask an apology.<br /><br />\\"The Calamity\\" and the lengthy and solo ridden closer \\"Shogun\\" would be two other tracks that stood out the most for me. \\"The Calamity\\" simply because this song is by far some of the most mature all around song structure I have heard from these guys to date. Now if you are a fan of Trivium's duel guitar breakdown/soloing style then the closer is going to be a wet dream for you, with three of the best solo's the band has yet to perform.<br /><br />Trivium still seems to have a difficult time with lyrics though they are better on Shogun compared to previous releases. They are still a bit repetitive and can come off as a bit unemotional and lack any real structure. However the vocals are the best yet and am glad he is moving more away from the growling/yelling because truth be told he isn't very good at it. His 'clean' tone fits their style much better and accents the melodic sense the album holds from beginning to end.<br /><br />Rounding it out I feel Trivium still has a solid future ahead of them. This album only marks the beginning of possibly a whole new Trivium that more of the metal community may be able to respect. This album is a prime example of a band evolving and bettering themselves as a whole and thus I give it five stars. I hope my review was at least interesting and helped you in purchasing this album. One of the best releases of 2008.new Trivium that more of the metal community may be able to respect.

B001K3JF7K|5.0|This may just be my feeling,but Diane seems to have suffered a critical back lash ever since she married Mr Costello. Heart broken dreamers, those that believe great art can only be produced by the unloved or lonely, I don't know, but the 1 and 2 star reviews seem unfair. This is a Very fine album with some very deft, lush, and lovely covers. Others speak of a breathlessness in Diane's vocals. I found them very warm and appropriate for the mood. Or maybe shes just worn out from chasing after her 2 little boys[lol]. Diane has a rich body of work to look back on, this wonderful record proves shes still looking forward.

B000EXZI14|2.0|Most of the songs on the disc have been shortened from recording studio length to anywhere from one to three minutes.    Seriously, Heartbreaker and Nights on Broadway in 1:05?    Not nearly as much fun.
B001PA0FFO|2.0|No review, but a couple of doubts.  (1.) First, in the topically important subject of Father Flynn's conduct within his parish the audience should be presented with balanced arguments from both he and Sister Aloysius. Instead, we have a dominant/unbalanced presentation of the Sister's accusations over a weaker Father Flynn defense. That would be fine if the movie was entitled \\"Gossip\\". A more objective, albeit challenging movie would present the unfolding events as if to an omniscient audience and let us impartially decide guilt & innocence. In addition, the overindulgent & exaggerated acting only made it the more difficult to gleam the truth as to misconduct.   (2.) Second, the movie perpetuates the stereotype of misconduct within religious orders as being near rampant (shared blame with the media) even though the actual percentage of misconduct may be 0.01% and not statistically different than many other professions or categories of interest.
0441013597|4.0|This book is a really good science fiction novel.  Hard to start and get into because the writer created his own world and terminology (I suggest reading a few of the appendixes and checking out the glossary at the back), but really worth the trouble.
B001EO748M|5.0|While the series is very loosely based on the events of the life of Henry VIII the performances by JR Meyers and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More really make the piece.<br /><br />Natalie Dormer is pitch perfect as Anne, even if we can see through her and her family and find her annoying!<br /><br />Maria Doyle Kennedy as the Queen is superb. She is warm, human, dignified and we actually feel sorry for all the king is throwing away for a woman who ultimately proved to not be worth it.

The series is not as much of a 'bonkbuster' as the first one, though there are sexy bits, but there is a LOT of interesting stuff that will pique your interest in the real history if you can get past the nudie bits.<br /><br />It is a treat seeing Peter O'Toole as the new pope, the one who commissions Michaelangelo to do a bit of work here and there-very amusing.<br /><br />The Mark Smeaton parts were a bit silly, and partly for shock value and more sex, but I think they were trying to show a bit about the 'common man' and how all the men fascinated by Anne go to their doom except Thomas Wyatt, who as he says, was the only one who WAS guilty of ever having slept with her.<br /><br />The scenes between Henry and Anne which used to light up the screen become more and more sad, as he realizes he has turned his whole world upside down for a woman who lies to him.<br /><br />Also notice his loyal cortege of friends is now gone and the court rooms are curiously bare considering how busy the palace would have been at that time.  He is frequently alone, and even in the crowd scenes, he is with one person or another manuipulating.<br /><br />We start out so romantically with Anne, but soon  they are barely in the same county, let alone room. (GREAT acting). The death of John Fisher and Thomas More are the beginning of the end, and Anne's paranoid delusions and pathetic attempts to get back her power are painful to watch, they are so moving.<br /><br />Sad to say, Anne lasted less than 3 years, but the chaos she caused certainly makes true what he says to Chapuys--I want my reign to be remembered forever. --No doubt not the long and bloody and scandalous one it ended up being.<br /><br />And yet the union of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII gave us the worst and best queens England ever had, Mary (the Bloody)and Elizabeth, and shaped its destiny just as Anne herself did.<br /><br />We can never be sure how much her zeal for 'reform' was a grab for money, power, and in defiance of the church in trying to push through the divorce and marrying Henry, but there is no doubt the protestant reformation had the door opened through her and her family's cunning.<br /><br />The costumes, settings and acting make this, while not perfect, certainly an excellent way to savor history and the period, and it is a lot more historically accurate and uses many of the actual documents of the time.<br /><br />One complaint-why is Suffolk so wooden now-he always looks agrrieved but never says anything.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|Freelance law enforcers Virgil Cole, (Ed Harris), and Everett Hitch, (Viggio Mortensen), ride into the New Mexican town of Appaloosa one afternoon in 1882. Close-up shots reveal that neither man moves so much as a muscle on his face as each surveys the near-empty streets. And such stern faces they have!! Obviously, these two are not men to be messed with. Cole, a hardened Civil War vet, with a hair-trigger temper, has been hired by Appaloosa's local leaders to act as marshal until the area is rid of Randall Bragg, (Jeremy Irons), a wealthy rancher. New to the territory, Bragg wants to take over the region's copper mines. He and his sidekicks are a grungy band of murderous thugs. They terrorize the small town's residents, making their own rules and disrupting business as usual, often with a lethal effect. When Apaloosa's former sheriff and two deputies rode out to pay Bragg a \\"visit,\\" the villain shot and killed all three men. So, Cole and Hitch are hired, and are given power to impose order, by whatever means necessary.<br /><br />Everett Hitch is the deputy with a capital \\"D,\\" and the film's narrator. A West Point-trained ex-cavalry officer, he has been working with Cole, traveling and cleaning up the frontier, for many years. I was really drawn to this character of many contrasts. Highly educated, articulate, introspective, and clearly a leader of men, he gave up soldiering because he was tired of fighting in the Indian Wars. Yet, Hitch makes his living through violence - shooting and killing within the limits of the law, except for once. Virgil Cole, on the other hand, is explosive, a self-taught man, who is almost the exact opposite of his partner. The two, however, share a great rapport and are completely at ease with one another. This relationship is what pulls the movie together and makes it work. Cole and Hitch are men of honor who have a deep and abiding respect for each other - friends as well as partners - sort of like Butch Cassidy and Sundance without the sense of humor! Actually, there are wryly comic moments, mostly banter, in between bursts of gunfire, and though not laugh-out-loud funny, these amusing moments do provide a break from the tension.<br /><br />At this point, a lady enters the picture. Don't they always? Renee Zellweger plays Allison, (Allie), French, whose arrival coincides with the lawmen's by a day or so. Both are attracted to the lovely, refined widow, with only a dollar to her name, but Virgil wins the gal, \\"supposedly.\\" He even gets her a job, playing piano at the local hotel. Allie is quite different from the \\"whores and squaws\\" both men usually associate with. There are few \\"ladies\\" in this part of the world. While Everett is tempted, he doesn't even make a play for Allie, seeing that his partner is smitten. Everett seems to place his partner's welfare before his own, without appearing overly altruistic. Allie's personality is disturbing and complex, but I will remain mum on the subject from here on - no spoilers.<br /><br />The tension builds between Bragg and Cole, with Bragg trying to reach an accommodation while Cole remains implacable in his goal to bring the outlaw to justice. When a witness to the killings of the sheriff and deputies comes forward and agrees to testify, Bragg is finally arrested and brought to trial. The story and major conflicts really begin to pick-up pace at this point. Each character reveals more of his/her personality as the action gets rougher and tougher. I found the ending to be surprising and somewhat bittersweet.<br /><br />The cinematography is outstanding!!!! Kudos to Australian photographer Dean Semler, who worked on \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and the TV mini-series \\"Lonesome Dove.\\" There are some shots which are amazingly beautiful and worth the price of admission, or the cost of a rental, on their merit alone.<br /><br />Ed Harris acts, directs, and produces \\"Apploosa\\" which is based on Robert B Parker's western novel of the same name. Harris also co-wrote the screenplay.<br /><br />I love a well made Western...and this is one with a few twists. Recommended!<br />Jana Perskieade Western...and this is one with a few twists.

B000OCXF0Q|5.0|I own Avril Lavigns previous 2 albums, and I adore them very much. When I heard about her third album being released I bought it straight away. After the first time of listening to it, I noticed how some of the songs were quite different from her other albums so I was unsure if I'd like it or not. However after listening a couple of more times, I had a sense of the album and loved it. I like how there is some upbeat catchy songs, such as Girlfriend, The Best Damn Thing, Hot, but I also like how there is some slower songs such as When You're Gone, Innocence and Keep Holding On. I think its great that Avril had some fun with this album, it does make a nice change.<br /><br />The only song on the album which I'm not too keen on is \\"I Don't Have To Try\\". The only reason I dislike this song, is due to how it starts \\"I'm the one, I'm the one who knows the dance\\" followed by 2 similar lines, but once that is out of the way with, I quite like the song.<br /><br />I also enjoyed seeing the footage on the DVD. :D
0440237688|5.0|Teenagers these days are currupted to think that good books hve high-flying action and overly dramatic characters. While these can make a good story, a true masterpeice is something more. I read this book in the sixth grade (last year), and adored it. Why? It made me think. It made me ask myself what it really means to be human, and if a socialist society is really what as good as it looks. It kind of reminds me of WALL-E in the sense the people are surviving, but not truly living. Those who rate the book as boring don't seem to get the book at all. It's not the \\"Twilight\\" type, but it's not supossed to be. It's much better because you need to actually need to use *gasp* intelligence to understand it. If you read it for only the story, yes, it won't be to amazing. But the stylistic writing and messages it portrays are what make it so good. Remember my comparison to WALL-E? One of the most used arguments against that excellent movie is the lack of diolougue and that it is also boring. Sure, it may be easier to watch, say, Kung Fu Panda, but WALL-E is a genuinly better movie because it's not meant to be easy. It's meant to make you think. And that is what The Giver is.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|This is one of my favorite Bonds. Between Peirce Brosnans acting ant the storyline it is great. Some have said that it is a remake of You Only Liv Twice and The Spy Who Loved Me, but it is also different and quite memorable. The may have the same overarching plot, but the specifics are very different and every one of them is memorable for different reasons. I like the change from a villain who tries to blow up the world with a Nuke or whatever. This is a new kind of villain that is more for the 21st century. This is my favorite Brosnan Bond and is up there in my favorites of all time.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I just don't get it. \\"Fans\\" seem to want to hate on everything Metallica does. Would you all prefer that Metallica just re-release Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, and And Justice for All? I mean, this album is excellent. It's far and away one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Everyone wants to complain about the sound quality. I've been playing this album since the day it came out and I haven't heard anything wrong with it. Are my ears messed up or something? I think it sounds awesome and I love how loud this record is. This is fine metal my friends, at this point it doesn't matter what Metallica does, people are going to hate on them. Bottom line--if you like Metallica, buy this album. You won't be dissapointed. If you do buy this and you hate it, ask yourself; What is it that I want from Metallica?<br /><br />P.S. I am thankful that my ears are not so superior that I can pick up on the annoying subtle nuances that make this record unlistenable.

B001P5Q6FC|5.0|If you're like me and always worry that your favorite metal bands will eventually go soft or sell out -- good news. Wrath is, like the band's moniker states, Pure American Metal. Every song is heavy as hell, fast-paced and filled with amazing riffs, unbelievable drumming and the best vocals Randy Blythe has ever laid down.     No metalhead could not listen to this album and love every head-banging second of it.
B001GM28HO|4.0|There is no doubt that this album is a great dance and feel good record, but it is more. Lady GaGa has a great and powerful voice which does shine through the beat. There is also no doubt that the songs do have a retro feel to the likes of Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, The Waitresses, The Go Gos, and several others from the 80s. That is no big surprise since this time period was her inspiration. However, she is able to come through as fresh which many of the other female singers of today are not able to do. Personally I think she is much better than Gwen Stefani who many have related her to. Gwen Stefani is fine, but her songs with No Doubt are in my opinion are far better than her solo efforts. There is a likeness to the present day Britney Spears, but Britney has also been heavily influenced by Madonna. It is interesting to note that some reviews have criticized the song \\"Brown Eyes\\" which I think is the one song that shows Lady GaGa in a different, but good, way.  It is hard to tell what will happen with Lady GaGa, but she is deserving of a long and profitable career. This album shows that she should definitely be more than a one hit wonder which of course she already is with the huge hits of \\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Poker Face.\\"  I definitely recommend this CD and this will be a huge album throughout the summer of 2009.

006079383X|3.0|This book is the beginning or Genesis for Warren Buffet's origins on how he learned to invest.  It is good, however, like many of the other reviews, it is outdated with its information and is hard to follow.  Many of the concepts in this book are captured in other books about Warren Buffet, such as Rule #1 by Phil Town, I highly recommend that book.  This book is good for expired investors how track the history of the stock market.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|This movie is quite simply one of the best told, best produced and most uplifting tales ever made on film. The story of the main character, as told through a series of flashbacks during a vicious police torture session, is as compelling as it is brutal especially to American audiences unfamiliar with the realities of India's deep religious and ethnic rifts. In addition, the superb stagecraft by Boyle and his talented cast and crew gives the viewer a palpable sense of the depth of poverty from which the characters emerge, something very alien and most likely unbelievable to suburban Americans who consider a ten-hour power outage something akin to living in caves. The true beauty of this film, however, is the steely resilience and imaginative machinations once the children are orphaned and forced to eke out a living in spite of \\"considerable\\" obstacles. This movie will move you in ways you've never imagined. It left my wife and I exhausted by the magnitude of the forces overcome and it also left us in a puddle of tears.  ps- I NEVER cry at movies &lt;wink>

B0015RRN8O|5.0|the thomas crown affair stands as one of those cinematic moments where the re-make truly builds on the cultural foundation of the original film so much so that the newer film -- starring rene russo and pierce brosnan -- crystalizes the original intent far better than the film on which its based.  while the great steve mcqueen and faye dunaway could have done no better, the raw sexuality of the second film matched with the even more over-the-top antics of the affluent make the second film soar. the first features a bank robbery, the second an art heist -- you almost have to have money to even understand the crime in the second film.  the first film introduces faye in a scandalous mini-dress, the second throws rene onto the scene in tailored perfection, legs for days, and a fur.<br /><br />while the plots do diverge in many ways, it's interesting to see what society would allow of a woman in the late sixties and how much further that got pushed forward by the late nineties.  if only the studios saw the wisdom in creating these \\"two packs\\" so audiences could decide for themselves.  a treat for fans of the old and the new.
B001PA0FF4|5.0|Without a doubt the best movie I've seen this year.  The acting by Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Viola Davis was incredible. I cannot stress enough that Meryl Streep was robbed at the awards for Best Actress.

0765317389|5.0|I don't know why it took me three decades to get around to reading this book. I've been reading SF since the 1950s and I'd heard this is a classic, but somehow I missed reading it. Anyhow, I finally read it and understand what the buzz is all about. This really IS one of the 50 best SF novels ever, and a great read. Don't wait 30 years to read it like I did!

0783229526|5.0|Similar to Fight Club, Fear and Loathing was unfairly treated by critics. It was labeled \\"Worst Movie of 1998\\" by lots of critics. It even got the \\"Pointless\\" label. It's really sad that a masterpiece like this got so much panning, because really, Fear and Loathing was INTENTIONALLY pointless. And anyone who has read the book would know this. In fact, with how many rave reviews the book got and how many negative reviews leads me to think that only idiots become critics.<br /><br />Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas is not a drug movie. Sure it has lots of trippy parts and the two characters are stoned almost the whole movie. But this movie is about the American dream and how we look at it.<br /><br />Raoul Duke is a young man with his sidekick Dr. Gonzo on a business trip. Along them is a hot convertible, lots of beer, Raoul's typewriter, and an entire suitcase of hard drugs. With the latter in mind, the word trip becomes a key word, as that's what they do. With time to kill in Vegas, Dr. Gonzo and Raoul go on a disastrous journey that involves misadventure after misadventure, bad trip after bad trip, which leads their lives into a downward spiral.<br /><br />Fear and Loathing is disturbing, but just so funny all at once. Despite the Canadian \\"PG\\" rating on the back, this is NOT for the faint-hearted. But if you really look at it, we may never get a movie like this ever again. And the \\"White rabbit\\" scene is worth it alone... I was in tears by the end of that scene.<br /><br />So if you can take a good film that's very unconventional you will enjoy this for sure. And remember, \\"We can't stop here! This is Bat Country!\\"
B00005JPY2|1.0|I watched this movie last week and walked out of the theater feeling<br />really stupid to have wasted $10 and 3 hours of my time on the piece of<br />junk.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" is one of the top mini-series made including \\"Band of Brothers\\", \\"Shogun\\", and \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\". Each episode seemed to have its own flavor. From the origins of space flight to the production of the \\"Lunar Module\\"(LEM) to the final missions using the \\"Lunar Rover\\" and the finding of the moon rock. It is an extremely enthralling journey of discovery and of wonder.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|When disco first emerged, my motto was pretty much \\"Death before disco.\\"  I have to hand it to this woman--she made a disco album that I love, and play frequently!

B000EXZDOQ|5.0|This CD is by far the best Coverdale and Co. ever put out. This is the blues rock Whitesnake of early 1980's. The addition of Ian Paice on drums makes this the classic lineup. At least 4 of these songs were concert staples. So much more soul and substance than the MTV crap of the late 80's Whitesnake. I can't begin to count how many people I turned onto this era of Snake music. Most Americans never even knew they put out any music before Still of the Night.
B00004XPPC|4.0|What an intricate movie hidden by such a simple story line driven by \\"complex\\" characters (on surface their motivation are easily understood and acceptable).  The story is about duty, honor, and appearances. What adds to this movie is the humor in it, witty and practical (the \\"with a parachute?\\" is priceless). They do not and probably cannot make movies like this anymore. As far as adventure goes buddy-action flicks and even romance-action movies rule the day.<br /><br />There are essential 2 protagonists in this movie. The American \\"Commander\\" and the English Colonel, both fight to keep their appearances up despite their difficulty fortunes. Both characters motivations can be understood, although it may take more thought to accomplish that of the English Colonel's. Central to the action is the bridge itself, representing perhaps a kind of monument to the people that fight wars.<br />The film desperately needed a technical advisor concerning its commando team. In fact this is where 20 minutes of film could be cut. Too much focus was put on the team and their actions in route which only slowed the film down and misdirected it. Its only use was to quickly showcase the American's philosophy on war and life compared to what he thought of the Brits version (the scene lasted less than a minute).<br /><br />The end has an interesting twist that will have you yelling with excitement at the screen. The only logical conclusion for the ending and what the bridge represents is madness.<br /><br />With a playing time of almost 3 hours this movie is completely worth it. Fans of war films, drama, and adventure should like this despite the lack of modern tastes in production style.
B001ECQ6E2|3.0|After eagerly awaiting the blu-ray release of this classic, I found myself thoroughly disappointed by Warner's incomplete restoration.     The first 1/3 of the film is covered in countless scratches, specks and nicks particularly in the first 20 minutes of the film. It is very distracting in high-def and on a large screen, and should have been cleaned up as part of the restoration. Surprisingly this film is clean in the second and third hour, as if the film went through a different process or standard. Also the sound is a simple mono track, unacceptable in the new era of Dolby True HD and DTS Master Audio. Some multi-track sound should have been a minimum.    Warner should have taken example of brilliant picture and sound restorations on other classics by other studios such as The Robe, Beckett and Sand Pebbles and even Warner's own Blade Runner.    Nevertheless, the image is bright and exhibiting the luxuriant, vibrant hues of three-strip Technicolor. It also displays a film-like feel, thanks to a grain structure that lends the picture texture and depth. However the picture clarity is soft but this is most likely due to the way the picture was originally lensed.    Unfortunately, Warner went only half way with this restoration. It could have been a great, as this wonderful picture deserves.
1416550542|5.0|The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton is a wonderful book, weaving the past and the present in an intriguing mystery spanning a century! A little girl is abandoned on a ship headed for Australia in 1913 with nothing but a few clothes and a book of fairy tales. Taken in by a kindly man and his wife who eventually decide to keep her as their own, the little girl is never told her true origins until her 21st birthday.<br /><br />With her world shattered, \\"Nell\\" as she came to be known known, withdraws from the family and starts out on her own, determined to find out who her real family is and where they are. Through the span of time, Nell never finds all the answers she needs; it takes her granddaughter, Cassandra, to unravel the mystery. As Cassandra attempts to find answers to Nell's puzzling deathbed tale, she uncovers a mystery that's like a spider who has weaved his web, each piece belonging to another one.<br /><br />\\"The Forgotten Garden\\" works not only through the actions of its strong female characters, but also through the fairy tales of Nell's past, providing clues to the generations-spanning mystery.<br /><br />Although a hefty book, almost 600 pages, this is the best book I have read in many years, filled with love, heartbreak, deep soul searching, tears and laughter. It's really hard to put down once you start reading. I cannot give enough praise to this fine writer, the book is amazing!
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|The picture is crystal clear - it is like being at the concert.  Even though Mercury is long dead, he looks very much alive on this disc (I know he WAS alive on this disc, but you know what I mean).  The sound is spectacular and this disc is in 24/96Khz!  For that alone it's worth a purchase.  The music sounds pefect.  With Blu Ray, it's like being there!
B001KNUQ64|5.0|PLEASE NOTE-THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE NEW AUDIO FIDELITY GOLD VERSION OF \\"PET SOUNDS\\" FOR SOME REASON AMAZON IS GROUPING REVIEWS OF THIS ALBUM UNDER ONE HEADING.<br /><br />One of Brian Wilson's masterpieces \\"Pet Sounds\\" was his response to the increasingly sopisticated albums by The Beatles. Working with the best session musicians in the business (something Wilson would do while The rest of The Beach Boys were touring), Wilson composed and produced \\"Pet Sounds\\" and then invited the band to come in and do the vocals, contribute lyrics as needed, etc.<br /><br />This new Audio Fidelity remaster is the second time that Steve Hoffman has done this popular title. Evidently the original mastertapes are in fragile shape so Hoffman used a first generation copy that was unequalized (the same one he used on the DCC release)to remaster this again. I never had the DCC but I did have the Capital mono master and this edition blows away that version which used noise reduction. The album sounds warm and inviting with nice detail and isn't compressed or too loud. The disc is also HDCD encoded for those with high definition CD players. After the debacle with the reissue of \\"Heartbeat City\\", it appears that Audio Fidelity got this one right.<br /><br />The booklet includes Brian Wilson's note on his intent with \\"Pet Sounds\\" as well as photos but it doesn't include the extensive booklet that came with the previous Capital editions of the album which is a bit disappointing. I should note though that all the musicians that played on this classic release are credited in the booklet. Other than that this is a terrific reissue and is available for a limited time with each edition numbered on the cardboard sleeve that houses the jewel box.<br /><br />Brian Wilson's classic song cycle has never sounded better to me. Highly recommended.
B001R10BM8|4.0|While the critics love to call this a film that should not have been made (maybe they are correct), it is still a good movie.  I am not one of those who thinks that Conner was the best Bond simply because he was the first to those who cannot accept change.  I grew up with Moore and Dalton.    The pciture quality on this disc is great, BUT if you recall watching this on cable all those years ago (they wore this movie out), then even on BD, you will be reminded of a picture that looked similar to back then.  While it is in HD and good, it still has that haze or slight dullness to the picture that you recall.  Even on BD, whenever I see a film from the middle of the 1980s' (usually 1983-1988), I see this haze or slight dullness/smoothness in the picture that was a clearly about the medium or type of film used then.  Don't get me wrong, it is still detailed and 3-D (especially on a Panasonic Blu-Ray), just looking like film stock.    Along with the picture is some of the same type of sound from that era as well.  You know, that un-EQ'd sound where there is a lot of bass and mids, but lower treble.  While better on BD, it still has those traits.  I have noticed this on Lethal Weapons as well.  They clearly fixed it as much as they could, but it is not a like a fix on the remaster Terminator 1 BD where that is how redone audio should be done.    No matter what, it is still the best that you will get on this film.  This film is good and is not considered a \\"real\\" Bond film, but you must have it in the collection no matter what.
B000P0TZK6|4.0|I love this movie, it's one of my favorites! This movie is based on a short story by stephen king. It centers on a wrighter, Mort Rainy who is recently divorced. One morning He is approached by a strange man who claims that he stole a story of his. Mort thinks that this guy is just some crazy fan...until strange things start to happen...Great movie and great story.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|Some speak of this BD disc in regards to the 5th Element, which was just a bad transfer. The Terminator was a low budget film, unlike T2 and the 5th Element. I expect those two films to look good, I don't expect miracles from The Terminator. Now when you consider the first DVD edition and the rare Super VHS edition, this is a huge step up. Originally the sound was in mono, then they stepped it up to surround sound and uncompressed PCM at that! It is the source that is at fault, but it STILL looks better than many films on BD.     You can take a home movie that was shot on VHS, DVD Cam or HD, which will look best went put on Blu Ray? It is the source. Not all sources are good and not all were shot on high quality 70mm film. It is low budget from 1984, what do you expect? Even much larger budget films from 1983-1988 have a similar look, maybe a little cleaner. Not all movies are shot on the same films with the same cameras or the same lighting.  You will have variation.    I think they did a great job on this film especially when you compare it with the never ending remasters of T2.  T2 had a higher budget and higher quality, not to mention digital effects.  T1 was low budget like a martial arts film from the 1970's.  You cannot expect everything in HD to look the same or look like The Incredible Hulk.  I know some early James bond films from the 60's look better than some from the 90's when in theory the 90's films should look way better, but it has to be the source.  Although in the 90's Bond films, it could be the transfer since I know the source had to have been great with the digital effects and all.    Take it from me.  I had the VHS and Super VHS versions as well as DVD, this IS a very good upgrade in HD.

B000OVLBF8|5.0|Great movie love Nicholas Cage Drama
B001C48EF6|4.0|Starring Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada, Charlie Wilson's War) and Rupert Friend (Pride & Prejudice, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas) \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a whimsical, romanticized look at the troublesome first years of the reign of Britain's longest-serving monarch, and her much-lauded marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.    Now, let me begin this review by asking all those of you baying for historical accuracy! Historical accuracy! Historical accuracy! - to please look elsewhere: from the second this movie kicks off it's very clear that this isn't going to be a painstakingly documented, realistically-imagined exercise in statecraft and royal alliance - \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a romantic drama, and I mean romantic in the most literal sense of the word.     Performances are all top-notch, with Emily Blunt's excellent reading of Victoria as a self-possessed, confident heroine being the standout best. Friend's portrayal of Albert as a lovelorn young man confined by duty and advisors is also great, and (thank heavens!) his accent is reasonable. Together the pair have real onscreen chemistry, and this provides the meat and potatoes of the movie - the restrained and forced nature of their relationship giving way to something real and passionate is finely drawn and satisfying, and a rarity given the recent spate of so-so Royal adaptations (The Other Boleyn Girl, The Duchess).    The sub-plots involving Victoria's weak mother and manipulative pseudo-stepfather (an excellent pairing of Miranda Richardson with Mark Strong) and Victoria's initial, ill-advised alliance with ex-Prime Minister Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) provide narrative fodder and a break from the central relationship of the movie - all give solid performances, all are well-scripted characters, and the inclusion of these elements is welcome, as opposed to distracting.    Cinematography and direction are superlative, and this is one area where \\"The Young Victoria\\" really shines. A gorgeous movie, this needs to be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate the lush colors, textures and brilliant vistas of director Jean-Marc Vallée's work. Ilan Eshkeri's score is a perfect match: stirring, rich and elegant, it's beautifully used and beautifully executed.    So what's wrong with \\"The Young Victoria\\"? It ends rather abruptly - I found the events of the final fifteen minutes of the movie deserving of more than the screenplay gives them - and, like I said before, this isn't a terribly realistic film - I am sure that Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha did more to win such a politically advantageous bride than simply lounge around in German palaces sighing attractively. While the artistic license taken with the facts of history suits this picture, with talent like Blunt and Friend on offer, I feel the screenplay could have added more layers to their characters.    But this isn't a major complaint, and, happily, I can recommend  \\"The Young Victoria\\" to all, for what it is: a straightforward romantic movie. But it's a particularly well-made romantic movie, with an excellent cast, beautiful audio-visuals, and overall is a real treat.

B000002L9M|4.0|BC may be their best 80's overall effort, by a lot, not so much because of a darker mood but perhaps in spite of, with brooding polish and measured, arresting vocals guiding the procession unusually well instead of falling for its cliches.

B000002UYZ|4.0|I bought this double album CD set because I wanted a good collection of earlier Beatle hits to put on my iPod. While the first four songs are in mono, the rest are in stereo and sound great. It was announced a few days ago that the entire Beatles catalog will be reissued in remastered stereo in original UK editions. I have held off purchasing the Beatles hits on CD because they have not been remastered. I still have a large selection of records of their music and will be looking forward to the remastered CDs coming later this year. It is great to hear these songs on my iPod since Beatle music is not available in digital form yet. The Beatles still rock!

This was in contrast to his previous books which are superficial but mostly accurate and readable rehashes of the better work of others.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|nothing here to complain about, its got all the catchy riffs, epic moments, and awsome solos we came to expect from one of the pioneers of metal. as greedy as i think they are, and as little i like them as people, i can still give them respect for their accomplishments in music. metal wouldnt be where it is today if it wasnt for metallica. part of why i always thought they were perfectly named. its not a full revival of their gloy days, but its their best album in over 15 years, and thats more than i could've ever hoped for after what they released, especially the atrocious St. Anger (where were the solos? where was the variety? what happened?) oh well, good to be long past the days of that album. Death Magnetic is a sign that these guys still have what it takes, and a sign of more good(possibly even better) music from Metallica in the future.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|This was a good movie
B001BGTWXI|2.0|they did it again, ill admit its a step up from that atrocious \\"Volume 3\\", but they did it again nonetheless. they made another stone sour album with slipknot written on the cover and im thoroughly fed up. luckily their last album was horrible enough to cause me to lose all faith, leaving my disappointment in this album minimal. they were one of the bands that first got me into modern metal with their album Iowa. its a shame. Psychosocial is the only song that rises above the uninspired mediocrity. they're just cashing the checks of america's depressed 12 year olds now.

0743298039|3.0|I enjoyed the classic style tale of twisted family secrets.  It was a bit slow at times, overly descriptive- but if you can endure those small slow bits, the rest is definitely worth the read.  Not exactly the ghost story you think it may be- if you are looking for the paranormal ghost.
B0018SWA56|5.0|I started this book a little impartial to Rachel's story, from Something Borrowed. And it was hard to feel for Darcy, as I started reading this book.  But as you get into the story, you do see that there are always two sides to a story, and that Darcy doesn't seem all that bad.  You will actually start to feel for Darcy and cheer her on in the end.  This book is a must read, especially after Something Borrowed!  A great ending to the saga of friendship between Rachel and Darcy.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|This was a wonderful movie.  I wish there were more like this one for the people to watch instead of so much trash.  This had meaning and a story behind it.  Instead of sex, sex, sex, and killings just to be killing people.  I rate this movie as a number one movie.

B001PA0FFO|3.0|Although exceedingly well acted, the plot is predictable and unsatisfying.  Certainly, as in real life, we don't really know the \\"truth\\" and in that way the movie is true to its seeming intent.  However, the Streep character is completely unsympathetic, without even a glimmer of humanity, whereas Hoffman's pederast priest is portrayed as a caring human being.  Something is wrong here, and the political prejudices of the director detract from the integrity of what should be a fascinating discussion of some serious present day issues, framed in the context of the mid-sixties mores in which they had their beginnings.

0061474355|4.0|This is a great read involving a truly original fantasy. The `magic' used here is not the overused theme involving witches and wizards, elves, dwarves and dragons, but is instead a world completely of Nix's invention. Although Nix's excavation of the world within the story is only at the tip of expansion even after the third book of the trilogy, he does an excellent job of developing the fantasy and creating characters that involve several layers within their motivations and personalities. Sabriel is an above average teenager, but she's still riddled with many of the average teen issues: love for her father, blossoming love for Touchstone, the fear of death and isolation.<br /><br />The story itself is not anything new, a girl of promise with special abilities is chosen to rescue an entire kingdom with just her wits and knowledge of necromancy. However, Nix delivers it well, and he does an excellent job of painting the world for the imagination of the readers and creating empathy for the characters by giving them depth and relatable human qualities. At no point does it seem that she only overcomes her difficult circumstances by blind luck or chance, or deus ex machina (a god from a machine) where it utilizes all of the reader's willing suspension of disbelief to be convinced that the `good guys' were able to win in the end. I recommend this book to anyone ages 12 and up.<br /><br />-Lindsey Miller, [...]

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Bought Blu-Ray to replace the HD-DVD in case the Blade Runner Five-Disc Complete Collector's edition goes out of print and my HD-DVD player fails. I am that much of a Blade Runner fan and watch it at least yearly since it came out. The price was fair enouugh and the shipping was fast. Both HD-DVD and Blu-Ray look better than the director's cut although that looks very good with a good up-rezzing chip. The scenes portray the bleak raining Los Angeles but now the eye candy is crisp and more attractive. The basic story is 5 stars even if you are watching on VCR so the Blu-Ray is just icing on the cake. Get Blade Runner and watch it on your device. If you can wacth it at 1080p, that's great but it is a great flick regardless of whether it's on Blu-Ray HD-DVD or regular 480i DVD. The alternative versions give more hints as to whether Deckard is a replicant but it leaves it vague enough so that the viewer must still make that decision and that contributed to the mystique. Plus Harrison Ford (aka Hans Solo and Indiana Jones) is just perfect as the Blade Runner.

Pretty stupid considering (We,the people who are trying to do things \\"The right way\\") have to jump through hoops to get/play their music legally, while the others don't worry about it at all.  The Music is good...Would have been 4 stars for the content....  But when it contains \\"booby traps\\"...They can keep it.
B001O2ZW1A|4.0|Those expecting Steve Wilson's debut solo album Insurgentes to be a Porcupine Tree clone are going to be disappointed. But those who expect his debut to showcase the broad range of his many talents will be delighted. Of course, you will hear songs that evoke past work and that is probably unavoidable, but Insurgentes is distinctive in its own right.  On this project, Wilson has brought prog journeymen Jordan Rudess and Tony Levin aboard along with other interesting but more obscure musicians to buttress the core band. The results are quite satisfying though not particularly outstanding. I like most of the album well enough, but to me the only real standouts are Harmony Korine, No Twilight Within the Courts of the Sun, and Only Child.  Insurgentes comes with a DVD audio disc similar in style to those provided with some of Wilson's other recent projects and an attractive insert featuring album info and lots of pictures. Also like many recent projects, it is very well packaged in a stylish and sturdy super jewel box with a slipcover. Most fans of Steve Wilson are bound to be pleased to add this CD to their collections. If you are a fan, be sure to add it to yours.
B000G8NY4U|4.0|The seller shipped the DVD on time and in condition said at time of purchase. The DVD is a great buy. Yanni style of music is unique but if you are into theather, orchrestra style, semi-relaxing music, add this one to your collection. I like it myself. For $20, you can not be losing much in case you did not like it. A trip to a bar probably cost you more
B0011FTQ4O|4.0|Why is crap like Mall Cop available on BluRay in the USA and classics like this timeless rock epic (based upon the lightly fictionalized escapades of director Cameron Crowe when he wrote for Rolling Stone) are only available as overpriced imports? An amazing score features classic 70's tracks by Elton John and others, with too many classic scenes to mention. If you've not seen this yet do yourself a favor...
0312360266|3.0|It was okay...removing the annoying anecdotes, asides and silly words that the protagonist uses would have helped. The only reason I plan on reading the next book is that I am intrigued with the storyline, but I found the writing annoying
0375842209|5.0|I purchased this book after reading many of the positives reviews and I'm glad I did. This is a great book that is an easy read, but not because of simplicity in writing...you just don't want to put it down. Great emotion and depth of the characters and I love how \\"Death\\" narrates the story. I think that is one of the reasons why this book is really effective. I highly recommend!! (I've lent it out to two friends and they also fell in love with it.)
1551924560|2.0|After reading all seven Harry Potters and the Tales of Beedle the Bard, I find the Fantastic Beasts dissapointing.     It's just a list of wild and segamented imagination. Of course, you may say, all novels are out of imagination. You're right. But the imagination in this book is just dull, tedious and not funny.
0060736267|5.0|This book provided an authentic look at life in turn of the century New York city, among the working poor immigrant class.

B0000AMRJD|5.0|Alright, since this review is 20 some years too late, you should have already heard by now how great Scarface is. Even if you have been living under a rock, still, you probably have heard about the movies legacy. So I'll spare you the overly enthusiasic spiel about it's amazing tale of a true rags-to-richs scenario. I wont bore you about how Oliver Stone created rich and deep, 3 dimensional characters and how they were excently brought to life by the elite acting talents of Al Pacino, Michelle Pfieffer and Steven Bauer. I wont ramble on and on about Scarface's intesnity, and gritty portrayal of a lifestyle that we should try everything we can to stop. No, I wont do that, I will talk about whats the bad stuff in Scarface........ummmmm............it's a tad perdictable from time to time.

It can be used to entertain and help very young minds to create a story as they go through the book.  It may be fascinanting for adults as they progress through pages and realize that they couldn't figure out the real story and, on a more profound note, to accept that no matter what and how much we think we know about something, there is always a \\"bigger\\" picture to it.

B00005JPY2|5.0|I knew NOTHING of this comic prior to walking into the movie theater a couple of weeks ago, I came away throughly impressed.  In most \\"Comic Book\\" movies, the first thing sacrificed is dialogue.  Most times it hackneyed and more than a wee bit corny.  Watchmen, broke this mold.  The dialogue, cinematography, and the overall action is in a word, INCREDIBLE.  I recommend this flick if you're interested in a comic book movie that breaks the traditional mold of heroes, and villains, or simply, if you wish to see a great movie.  This one is so different than anything I've ever seen.  And, I see a HUGE amount of movies......    Speaking of huge.....    I could have done with MUCH less of Billy Crudup's blue tinted junk.      Other than this, I can wholeheartedly  recommend seeing this movie.  And, if I'm right, the DVD/Blu-Ray will bring even more exciting aspects to your screens at home.  I am really looking forward to the upcoming release.  I fully expect the DVD to be as incredible as the movie was in the theater.
1439136653|4.0|This book came on a little strong for me with the torture at the onset but once you get through that it picks up at a steady positive pace. There were so many parts of the book that were changed or left out in the movie and for me the book was so much more interesting and comprehensive. The characters were developed to a greater extent than the movie.  This is a good book and worth reading, especially if you liked the movie (which actually, having read the book first I found the movie disappointing).
0385751893|5.0|This is a film that is both beautiful and innocent and yet, acted in a time that was horrific ... it is very griping and spell binding with the conclusion just slapping one in the face.  The saddest part is that we still have indigent peoples being killed and their voices silenced because they are perceived to be inferior - ie, skin color, beliefs, and worse - they are \\"sport\\" for those who are truly evil.  We really never left the horrors of WWII.  This little film is one that will be with me forever.  I can highly recommend it.
B000TSIK14|4.0|After hearing the song Humanity I was blown away!! I really dig that melodious rock sound.  To be honest I was surprised Scorpions were still around(shame on me)        okay, I'll admit I got into Scorpions a little late (Savage Amusement) which I played over and over on cassette, and I thought Crazy World was awsome, but after that I lost track of them, got married had kids ect.  This album was like a breath of fresh air for me, after the grunge decade and the likes of Korn and other such garbage dominating the music scene.  Klause vocals sound as good as ever, I am very happy with this album.  Now, if only Whitesnake would put out another album.......Oh wait!      I can't speak for the kids, but if you're thirty something and like good rock n roll with lyrics you can understand while listening, you owe it to yourself to buy this one.
B000002I4S|5.0|This purchase was for my son and he was well pleased with it.  I would highly recommend this seller.
B000K2Q5XE|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. While it is a little on the bluesy side, I rather consider that a good thing. Whitesnake were a blues/rock band before the late 80s conversion to more straight edge rock.  The strongest track on the disc is 'Victim of Love' IMO as it really accentuates David Coverdale's voice. Of course 'Young Blood', 'Crying in the Rain', 'Here I go Again'and 'Saint an Sinners' are also strong tracks.       Whitesnake has always been unique to me as it exsists solely to accentuate the very powerful voice of David Coverdale, no matter the incarnation it is always the vocals that stand out.  Saints & Sinners is no different in that regard.

B00008WT5M|2.0|Thunderstruck is really the only song on the disc that \\"sticks to you\\" The rest are throwaways. A prime example (unfortunately) of a band living on former glories.  Prior to this I can remember Who Made Who being a good song. They probably should've hung it up after Flick of the Switch.
0307455874|1.0|If you're the type that likes style over substance, this just may be your find of a lifetime.  Truly a fluff piece for those who want to live in a social utopia... denying reality and substituting dreams along the way.    Skip this if you're grounded in reality.
B001R0KH3W|5.0|I've been a fan since 1966, but a huge fan since 1972, so obviously my review is favorable.  I've seen him in concert maybe 15 times since the 60s, but the tour he mounted in August 2007 was without a doubt the best ever.  I saw this tour in Baltimore and thought it was the best concert I'd ever been to.  I saw it again a month later in DC.  I followed it across the country via the youtube clips people posted from various cities and on to Australia and Europe.  And when I saw the press release that the final two shows were being recorded for Blu-Ray, it was enough to make me take the plunge and buy a Blu-Ray player.    I could quibble with song selection; I thought the set list in Baltimore was even better.  And it was blast in DC when he went all the way back to the 60s in the set.  But let's face it:  He has such a huge catalog; he can't possibly do all of the ones you want to hear.  But without a doubt, this concert is a definitive set of Stevie Wonder at his best.  And the band is ON FIRE!  The musicianship is second to none and he is in fine voice throughout.  It is a joy to see such talent up close and personal like this.  No interviews; no background segments; just 2+ hours of the Genius and his band doing what they do.    The picture in HD is shockingly colorful; almost 3D in some places with the effects and lighting on the stage.  The sound quality in HD Master Audio is astounding!  It is amazing that even on the uptempo cuts every instrument in the band has presence.  And the director did an awesome job of capturing the excitement of the crowd.    So, this is the best.  It's like going to a Stevie Wonder concert with even better sound than you'd hear in the building and you can play it over and over again in the comfort of your home theater.    Life is sweet!

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I bought this movie for a rainy day; but I felt compelled to watch it soon as I received it because of all the reviews I've read about the movie.  I must say that I have to concur with all my counterparts who gave this movie a 5 star rating.  Awesome movie for any day, rainy or not.  I will not bore you with another summary of the movie; but I will say that I'm really glad I bought it.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Love this DVD based on books by Robert B. Parker.  Tom Selleck becomes the lead character, Jesse Stone instead of Jesse Stone becoming Tom Selleck.  Well worth your time to see the characters fully developed and the scenery is beautiful.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Luis Mejia - Listening to Tea For The Tillerman all the way through is as peaceful as rewarding; it's hard to find a Stevens' repertoire so abundant of well crafted songs. What makes the album a classic is the message and the lyrics sector; you can hear with a sentimental ear how each song is masterfully touching and yet compelling, and they keep a simple formula which almost seems minimalistic to it's themes. The opener \\"Where Do The Children Play\\" gives the moral completeness of the artist, as Cat Stevens is one of the most socially conscious and interested individual in the music business; even for soft rock. \\"Hard Headed Woman\\", \\"Wild World\\" and \\"Sad Lisa\\" go through the same road, slow rythms covered by an instrospective mood, light themes, and a pair of simple acustic guitars to give the songs flavor. Also \\"Wild World\\" was a big hit for Stevens, remaining on top of his famous works along with \\"The First Cut Is The Deepest\\". After \\"Sad Lisa\\" the album starts to become faster and interesting; songs as \\"Miles From Nowhere\\", \\"Long Boats\\" and \\"Into White\\" are catchier and rythmical. And then again \\"Father And Son\\" and \\"But I Might Die Tonight\\" return us to the simple, beautiful mood of the album. It's such a well arranged album, each group of songs bring the listener a delightful interest to hear the album all the way through, and at last it leaves you comfortable and willing to listen to it again.
1416550542|5.0|The garden at Cliff Cottage may be forgotten, but you won't soon forget this imaginative and engrossing tale that spans three generations, nor will you fail to become involved in the family secrets of the four women whose intertwined lives are the basis of the story.  Rose, Eliza, Nell and Cassandra take us on a journey through time from 1913 to 2005 in this intricately layered story of personal discovery and a search for the true identity of an abandoned child.<br /><br />Kate Morton is endowed with a critical eye for detail and a talent for painting word pictures. With THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN she has done a magnificent job of drawing on these attributes and delivering a veritable feast for her readers .  Like a good cup of tea, GARDEN is an exotic blend that could be described as part Maeve Binchy, part Margaret Atwood and part Hans Christian Anderson.<br /><br />Like the maze in her story she leads us on an adventure that intrigues us with its twists and turns, occasionally confounds and perplexes us and occasionally forcing us to retrace our steps, but ultimately our patience is rewarded with a satisfying solution to a ninety year old mystery whose inception and conclusion lies on the grounds of the Blackhurst estate.<br /><br />This is not a novel for the lethargic nor those who are easily frustrated.  The story demands that the reader remain alert as the timeline moves back and forth supplying tiny bits and pieces of the mystery through each characters narrative.<br /><br />Having planted the individual seedlings that constitute both major and minor characters in her story, Ms. Morton has lovingly nurtured and developed each to present her readers with a vivid and stunning bouquet of imaginative prose.
B00005JMJG|3.0|Perhaps my mistake was watching this immediately after \\"Stranger than Fiction,\\" an equally overworked, derivative premise about a repressed, unfulfilled personality who requires not so much the extermination of his pedestrian self as the recovery of his more vital self (i.e. he needs the right, \\"spontaneous,\\" life-endowed woman).  The prototype is Chris Marker's 1962 masterpiece, \\"La Jetee,\\" a film that's as profound as it is fresh, provocative, and haunting.  The problem with these later spin-offs is not their lack of originality. Adrian Lyne's \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is one of several films to approach \\"La Jetee\\"'s greatness.  But these most recent efforts are low-budget formula pictures with big-budget stars that unfortunately lend validity to \\"Chick Flick\\" as a dismissive term for the whole sub-genre.<br /><br />The performances are often of Oscar-worthy quality.  But I don't recall Rosalind Russell (\\"His Girl Friday\\") or Katherine Hepburn (\\"Adam's Rib\\") ever being wasted in scripts so unworthy of their talents as are Emma Thompson and Kate Winslett.  Of the two present films, \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is the better-made movie, but \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is more ambitious and multi-dimensional.  The decidedly anti-intellectual message of \\"Stranger\\" is: Smelling and eating fresh-baked cookies not only satisfies the palate but heals the incomplete soul more surely than the agonized meanings of great literature.  \\"Spotless Mind\\" might be said to test this thesis by offering the viewer quotes from Nietszche (\\"Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders\\") and Alexander Pope (\\"How happy is the blameless vessel's lot/The world forgetting by the world forgot/Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\\").<br /><br />The problem is that the quotes are spoken out of context, as if the characters of the film (and their creator) are clueless to the irony of the quoted statements, both of which condemn forgetfulness and deride the notion of a \\"spotless mind.\\"  As if it weren't bad enough that the writers of the screenplay make mockery of Chris Marker's achievement, they misrepresent Nietszche and Alexander Pope, both of whom prefer to the sunshine of the spotless mind the mind that is alive \\"because\\" it remembers the past, however painful or imperfect it may be.  (How often I ponder the question of which is worse: the destruction of the world's great literary texts or the distorted, gross and even dangerous interpretations to which such texts, including the Bible, are subjected by tone-deaf, unimaginative, utterly \\"selfish\\" readers.)<br /><br />Both films overstay their welcome, attempting closure and not finding it. At least \\"Spotless Mind\\" provokes genuine reflection, and perhaps some minimal self-scrutiny at that.  Were the writers of the film as unashamedly didactic and verbal in their exit strategy as the makers of \\"Stranger Than Fiction,\\" I would have offered them the following (by Kierkegaard):  \\"When one has once fully entered the realm of love, the world - no matter how imperfect - becomes rich and beautiful, it consists solely of opportunities for love.\\"enough that the writers of the screenplay make mockery of Chris Marker's achievement, they misrepresent Nietszche and Alexander Pope, both of whom prefer to the sunshine of the spotless mind the mind that is alive \\"because\\" it remembers the past, however painful or imperfect it may be.

Yes I expected Mr Wonder to sing all of his hits, but he did them in a style and fashion that put this concert over the top. I didn't realize or should I say didn't remember just how many hits Stevie has had over the years. This outting was joyful, soulful, and just a plain delight to behold. I can't say enough on just how WONDERful this was. Over two hours of pure entertainment. It was well worth the price of admission and will be a great addition to any collectors collection.

0375424474|5.0|Dr. Shubin's book is the first one I read about the science of evolutionary biology, and it is excellent.  It presents the science in a way that is easily understood by the layman but is also a very enjoyable read.  Prior to reading his book I read \\"Monkey Girl\\" by Edward Humes, by way of an introduction to the creation vs evolution topic (also recommended).  Since reading \\"Your Inner Fish\\" I have also read \\"Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters\\" by Donald Prothero, \\"Only a Theory\\" by Ken Miller and \\"Why Evolution is True\\" by Jerry Coyne.  I would recommend all of these books for anyone who wants to really learn about the science, and also for those who want to be able to intelligently discuss the topic and the issue of religion versus science.  We don't need to create a conflict in our minds between religious beliefs and acceptance of good science.  If we do, we do a disservice to ourselves and, especially, to our children.
0345440900|3.0|This is a great book, filled with tons of excellent advice.  However, I read this book when my baby was 3 months old and found that what I had been doing up to that point was all 'wrong' (according to the methods in the book) and it became overwhelming to try to change all the bad habits that were developed in the meantime.  Reading this book made me feel like I had been doing a bad job in the first 3 months of my son's life.

B001EN71DG|4.0|The films in this Star Wars set were awesome, but not what I had in mind. I was expecting the set from 2008, but it was the one of 2005 to promote the release of Revenge of the Sith, the best of the prequels and the darkest in the series. The set of 2008 has the theatrical and 2004 enhanced versions, but this one just has the latter versions standalone. That would explain why it costed about $24.00. I am dead serious. It was neat, but when it comes to ordering used films online, please be careful. If the seller has an average rating below 95% by the public, the product would likely be flawed.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|Several reviews have rated this version of LITTLE DORRIT below the  earlier Alec Guiness,(GV) version.  I would disagree completely, (although Guiness is one of my favorite actors).  The acting, scenery, casting, and authenticity of this BBC version are far superior to the Guiness Version. Dorrit is portrayed by BBC as a generally happy girl in spite of her many misfortunes. Her sunny outlook makes her more vigorous and effective in helping others -- a very important facet of the story. In GV she is mainly melancholy with a turned down mouth.  In GV, her friend Arthur is portrayed at an advanced age, completely unsuitable for their future marriage --  which makes the final marriage ceremony seem almost comical. The man who plays Arthur in BBC is much closer to Dorrit's age, and appears to be a more sensitive character than in the GV. The portrayal of the debtors prison in GV, and in particular, the Dorrit prison apartment, makes the apartment look more like a civilized rooming house than a very uncivilized prison environment. Even Guiness' clothes in prison look pretty good; which is unreasonable after 20 years of prison poverty. As for Guiness' portrayal of the father, I always know that I am looking at Guiness because he uses his typical vocal inflections which he does not drop in this performance. In BBC, the father is not only a comparably good actor to Guiness, but a complete stranger to me; just an example of a grossly selfish father.  The background portrayal of London street scenes in the  1770s is much more correct in BBC than in GV. The tyrannical pressure of the british class system, the general noise, the public hurley-burly in the streets, and the energy to save one's own fortune at the expense of others is brought out with vigor in the BBC version, but is more laid back in the GV.  Finally, in order to give Guiness more air time for his long, and often boring speeches, important characters and facets of the complete story are left out, most of which are included in the BBC version.

076535618X|4.0|I'm 3/4 of the way through and it's a lot of fun.  I just loved \\"Old Man's War\\" and the closest thing I had ever read to science fiction before was \\"Jurasic Park\\" many years ago (before the movie).  A friend recommended it and I read it faster than any other book in a very long time.      \\"The Last Colony\\" is much closer to the style of \\"Old Man's War\\" and I'm enjoying it immensely.  It includes John Perry who I came to love in the first of the novels.     \\"Ghost Brigades\\" was good, but not in the same vein as the first and now this third installment.  \\"The Last Colony\\" is also written in first person (like \\"Old Man's War) and I like that, too.

B001H5X7I4|2.0|I very much looked forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, most of it did not work out for me. The movie just wasn't funny enough throughout. I enjoyed the fake previews adn the actual beginning of the movie, but other than that the rest of Tropic Thunder fell apart. Just because the movie has an all-star cast does not mean the movie will be a good one. Quite disappointing. Doesn't hit the spot for me.
B001GCUO1G|1.0|I haven't seen the film yet but a couple things really bother me. Firstly, why does sabertooth look nothing like the marvel character or the one from the first Xmen movie? From the looks of it he is actually shorter than Hugh Jackman...? That stinks. Secondly, I know I will not get to see Deadpool as he should be. He should be in costume. It would be infinitely better. Nothing against the actor playing him, but if you are going to make a movie and use certain characters, then use those characters, otherwise call them something else. The movie producers completely miss the point that these characters have become popular as they are, and not as they want to make them. I don't care if you want to see the actor's face so they can give expressions and act. I don't need to see Ryan Reynolds. I've seen him on the movie screen. I want to see Deadpool on the movie screen. Thank goodness we'll get to see Snake-eyes in the G.I. Joe film this summer (in mask). I guess these people would have him out of costume as well..
B001PR0Y4Y|2.0|Will appeal more to adolescents and young adults than to viewers above age 40. The storyline was okay, but the acting itself was vapid and insipid with a stammering and halting speaking style that many critics adored but which I found annoying and distracting.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Awesome film.  I pretty much buy anything that Seymour Hoffman sells (Boogie Nights, 25th Hour, Before the Devil...), but am not very familiar with the much more popular, commercially accepted Streep.  Clearly, she's a class-act, as her scenes with Hoffman burn up the screen.  Intriguing story, beautiful shots, use of color and light.  Thought-provoking.  I am always interested by the way directors portray NYC, and Shanley's depiction puts the viewer right there in mid-60's Bronx.  The juxtoposation of the nuns and male members of the church were stark and very telling.  The film exposes many norms of Traditional Catholicism to those who may not be familiar, but it doesn't try to shape or influence your views, however controversial the topic at hand may be.  Extremely controversial, given that the character of a suspected child molester is more likeable and personable than a nun.    If you like thoughtful, emotional drama that is superbly directed and acted and based upon a great story, don't doubt \\"Doubt.\\"
B001PPLIEG|3.0|I was really skeptical of Daniel Craig being able to pull off the role of James Bond. \\"Casino Royale\\" dashed my skepticism and convinced me that Craig IS Bond and the movie itself was, quite possibly, the \\"perfect\\" Bond film (maybe not the BEST, but a perfect Bond film nonetheless).    Well, \\"Quantum\\" picks up approximately five to ten minutes immediately after \\"Casino\\" and moves forward at a break-neck speed. The action sequences are very well done (although I did have a slight problem with the rapid editing - it proved to be a little too much and a little distracting) and the fight scenes are just about some of the most realistic and exciting as I've seen. Craig delivers a top-notch performance as the not-quite-so-debonaire (but he's getting there) and stoic \\"double-oh\\" agent. We are beginning to see his character evolve from a near-brutish thug he portrayed in \\"Casino\\" into a more suave and slightly more sophisticated agent.    My biggest problem with \\"Quantum\\" is the story. To sum up, I found the plot to be a bit too simplistic and the enemy organization which supposedly had people everywhere isn't quite as intimidating or forboding as you would expect. Regardless, this is a logical direct sequel (the first ever in the Bond franhcise) to \\"Casino\\" and still delivers a satisfying film that should please MOST Bond fans or, at least, fans of the genre.    It's a GOOD film, it's just not great like 2006's Casino Royale. To be fair, I would actually rate this movie at 3 and a half stars. And on a side note, \\"Quantum\\" gets my vote for having the WORST main title theme in the history of the Bond movies. I'm not particularly a Jack White fan, but I expected so much more from Alicia Keys. TERRIBLE song and easily forgettable.    I purchased the single disk edition which really has no interesting bonus features to speak of, but the picture and sound quality were excellent.    Recommended, but only if you're a Bond fan or a fan of espionage/action films.
0312330537|5.0|You cannot put this book down once you start it.  What a page turner!  The author has amazing insight into government, politicians, criminals, the justice system, and society in general.  One of the best books I have read in a decade.  I wished the ending of the book had been more specific about he was recaptured and went back to prison.  I wish that it had incorporated more about his re-incarceration, release, and travel back to Mumbai.    JB

If the next 3 books are this good, this series will definitely take the number one spot on my favorite series list, topping Harry Potter lol.

I finished reading the book 4 days ago and I'm still driving myself crazyyyyy and crying over Dimitri lol. I need them back together!!!Im going crazy over here till August!

B000002ADT|5.0|What is there to say? I have often heard it said that if you were going to own just one jazz album, this should be the one. It might be Miles' best known work. He transformed much about jazz with this album which represented a new approach for its day (c. 1959).    I'm sure, with the plethora of great jazz artists available today, the idea that this is the consummate jazz album is arguable at best, but it certainly is one every jazz listener should have in his(her) library.
B001QWBM62|4.0|In looking for a portable handheld recorder for scratch tracks and samples, I weighed the benefits of a few of the handhelds available today and settled on the H4n. The other recorders on my short list were the Edirol R-09 and Sony PCM-D50, and also the H4. So far the H4n hasn't disappointed.     I settled on the Zoom H4n for a couple of reasons:    1) 1/4\\" and XLR inputs with phantom power - Very handy for throwing a mic on a kick and snare, and the H4n will record those plus the internal condensor simultaneously, which is perfect to get the rest of the drum kit for some quick loop scratch tracks.    2) More geeked out features than the others - They are not needed but still fun to have. The H4n is like the Leatherman of handheld pocket recorders with plenty of built in effects (which sound really good btw), built in 4 track recorder mode, tuners and metronome, playback speed control, MP3 encoder, acts as USB audio interface (both input and output), built in monitor speaker, and more. I also like the little things I'm still discovering, like when I put Ni-MH batteries in and then plugin in the adapter it recharges the batteries.    3) Build - I like the build quality compared to the H4 - Not as nice as the Sony but the thing does feel solid and substantial in your hand. The built in mics are a little exposed without a wire cage on the top like others have, it would probably not be a good thing to drop this unit and have the mics hit first.    4) Cost - This recorder was midrange even with it being brand new. It's less than the Sony and more than the H4 or R-09. I suspect the price will come down a bit when it's been out for a couple months down to where the R-09 is now. For what it has built in it's amazing to be it's as inexpensive as it is.     5) Sound quality - The H4n sounds clean. I believe turning on the built in compressor, or boosting a really weak input signal with a lot of input gain could cause hiss, but for the most part I don't notice any. Usually thenoise floor is so low on what I've recorded that it is not audible. Some different mics and setups might have different results, time will tell.    6) Menu and button layout - I really like the way they set this unit up. Very easy to navigate and record with, and does what I want quickly with only a few caveats mentioned below.    7) SD card format - SD cards are cheap and readily available. I don't care so much for the memory sticks the Sony uses.      Now the downsides, maybe all these handheld recorders suffer from similar issues but I'm going to give my first impressions never having used one before and the H4n is the best I have to compare with:    1) Menu system - While easy to navigate, still feels like it could use refining through a firmware update. It feels like it wasn't finished when the product shipped. The fonts look a little like a 5 year old put them together, Zoom could have done better with the screen they put in the H4n. A lot of products like this are rushed to market to meet revenue goals, so hopefully they will get time to take another look at the firmware and make UI improvements. Also the firmware is trying to be a little too fancy with the menus. There is a little expanding box effect that happens when you open a menu, but it ends up just looking like screen artifacts when changing the menus. It would have been better to immediately jump to the menu, it would be faster and would look better.     2) File naming (another UI complaint) - I really wish the firmware gave you the ability to delete a character in a file name. The filename can be edited, but characters can only be added or changed, not deleted. If you use divide alot, the name gets larger and larger but cannot be made smaller. This is a bit annoying when combined with the divide implementation....    3) No divide while recording - there is no divide while recording that I could find. It seems like it would have been very easy to make one of the unused buttons act like a divide whenrecording. Instead you can set a \\"mark\\" (non editabled btw, after one is set it is permament in that wav file). The marks let you easily jump to that point and divide it later, but when it divides the file you end up with an 'A' or a 'B' tacked on to the filename. Now, imagine recording an entire gig or practice with only marks to use to delimit the songs, and then you have to divide them later with the naming scheme and lack of delete character function I mentioned above. What you end up getting is files named something like 'STE-001A.wav', STE-001B.wav', 'STE-001BBBBA.wav', and eventualy 'STE-001BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBA.wav' etc and there's not a lot you can do on the device to fix it since the best you can do is replace the extra characters with spaces so that you end up with a file named something like 'song blah                     .wav' (you can plug it in as a USB interface later and fix all the filenames in the folders, but not a lot you can do on site except stop and restart recordings versus using \\"marks\\").    4) Documentation - I'm not sure what Zoom was thinking here. The documentation looks like it was passed through a translation program without any proof reading before shipping. It is filled with sentences such as \\"On stereo mode can be made 19 different setting using. WAV & MP3. If you want to change, operate before recording\\". I get the general intent most of the time but it hurts. Luckily the unit is easy enough to use that you don't have to rely on the documentation too much.    As I see it, the complaints I have are mainly around details of the UI implementation and documentation and relatively minor. All around the unit is great and a lot of fun to use. The sound quality is top notch, and the capabilities of the device are astounding. I would have given it 5 stars if the few UI details had been better thought out and someone had read the documenation. For a great all around handheld recorder with excellent sound quality, lots of features, and a reasonable price, the Zoom unit is going to be very hard to beat.
1423424514|4.0|For those of you familiar with the original Real Books, you know they are both illegal and replete with errors. With this series, Hal Leonard has obtained the proper permissions for the standards all jazz students need to study. He has also supposedly corrected the transcription errors of the original Real Books and added a few tunes that weren't in them. However, though I am far from an expert, it is my opinion that certain errors appear in this book as well, though they are few and far between. I subtracted a star for that reason.  This particular book is the pocket sized version of the full sized Real Book by the same company and has all the same tunes in it. I own both. The smaller one is, however, highly readable and a lot more portable. The truth be told, you can do with just this one without owning the full sized one too.

This is pure Disney and will remain a classic for as long as there are kids with imaginations.

0061547840|4.0|I'd hear Donald Trump as a regular guest on the Jim Kerr Rock and Roll Morning Show in New York. I bought this book to give myself another perspective of Donald Trump.<br /><br />Intuition, instinct, a fight-back attitude among other attitudes and character traits confirmed what I had already gleaned from Mr. Trump's public image. A young entrepreneur with thoughts of taking on the world, and the mindset for keeping the wealth they someday may create would do well to consider a read of the book.<br /><br />There are no formulas or specifics, though. Page 113 describes a conversation at a bankers convention. A \\"barbarian\\" bank loan officer that had already bankrupted others has now set his sights on The Don who, at this time owed the bank 147 million. After talking to this barbarian about women at the convention, the next day Mr. Trump meets the loan officer and they work out a deal to everyone's satisfaction. I was disappointed, and I'm sure many foreclosed home mortgage owners would have enjoyed reading the nitty-gritty details on how this was done. To the common folk, the peon such as myself, this type of information spelled out in detail throughout a collection of different incidents inside the book would have made this book a fantastic read. Darn!<br /><br />On page 94, Mr. Trump claims, \\"I could negotiate peace in the Middle East-- very few other people could.\\" I know this is stated inside a book that wants one to Think Big, but ....,  there are millions of Islamists who attend Islamist universities and to eventually learn that the Qur'an (and thus Allah) commands them to strive to bring Sharia Law over every nation of the earth. These Qur'anic passages are and have been the motivation behind all their terrorist acts towards the West. No ambiguity or reinterpretation of the words inside the Qur'an stating this Sharia Law objective is needed. If one were not to follow this teaching and to subscribe to this objective then said person is not a true thus not the best Muslim. More inferior are you in the eyes of other more violent-minded Muslims if you are taught at a university and you are a radical or in some way rebellious to this objective of bringing Sharia Laws over every nation. The ideal rabble-rousing Muslim will quote from the Qur'an to refute the moderate Muslim, the belligerent Muslim then rising to the top of the next Islamist sect or denomination that wants to title themselves with being with the true, pure Muslim tradition. There were in the past and there will always be in the future the group of Islamists who read and understand those passages inside the Qur'an and know what the devout Muslim should do to please Allah. Read those passages and realize how difficult to consider refutation of the claim those passages are not inspired. The Islamist scholars themselves cannot find alternative rational for what is stated explicitly. All the words inside the Qur'an are inspired by Allah and must be obeyed and thus to subjugate and kill the infidel if necessary, or all the words inside the Qur'an ARE NOT inspired by Allah. Take your pick, Don, and good luck talking to a group of \\"educated\\" and very proud Islamists while on this peace train ride you're on. I digress.<br /><br />Mr. Zanker is the founder of the Learning Annex and co-authored the book, Think Big. He offers another individual insight into the mindset of the successful: those who created and then knew how to maintain the wealth they created.<br /><br />I'm over fifty years of age. I found the read and the information inside the stories  confirming my own demeanor and attitudes in life. Especially a passage at the end of the book where the advice is to think and plan and set up for any of the future events you anticipate and want to have happen before you are ready to actually commence the activity. Yes, set up your contractors, distributors, management, and construction companies, and anything else you can imagine you'll need even before you've bought theland and begin to construct the building! At fifty y.o. this to me is common sense, though I imagine not so to some young whipper snapper.<br /><br />It's a good book. I'm glad I bought it.

B000JLSM00|5.0|I've read that you really haven't seen a John Ford movie unless it was on the big screen. Now, after looking at one of my favorites -- The Searchers -- on a hi-def widescreen monitor, I've come to understand why. I've seen the film maybe eight times in standard definition, and LOVED IT. But with this blu-ray presentation, I was able to perceive details and compositions I hadn't appreciated before. Stunning landscapes, beautiful photography, wonderfully staged action -- the American West never looked so good. And with this level of detail, I was able to actually see the expressions of the actors within a scene, and this gave the movie greater depth and meaning. (Why does Ethan do what he does? It's seen in the looks he gives to his brother and sister-in-law early in the picture.)    It's old fashioned. People have complained to me about the stagey acting styles and the crustiness of John Wayne's character, but if you know what you're getting in to, this film is one of the great ones. Nowadays, it's virtually impossible to create a story with such epic, mythic themes.    What also pleased me about this purchase were the extras that came with the film -- including a couple of documentaries about its production and lasting impact as well as a discussion of the film's perceived racism. Didn't expect that at this low price.    If you love old westerns (or classic American filmmaking) this is a no-brainer purchase. A good excuse to get a blu-ray player.

These stand alongside the more familiar pantheon including Suzanne, Halleluiah, So Long Marianne, The Future, and I'm Your Man.<br /><br />To help deliver this rarified material, Cohen has assembled an amazing band.

0375758992|5.0|Alexandra (Bobo) Fuller's childhood memoir has such a ring of authenticity, truth and her story emerges as a whole drama that I couldn't put down. What captured me - was her honesty and humour about a hard and difficult family life - that showed me in the end that our spirit can transcend the dross of life and other people's inadvertent but consequential damage on our growing psyches.<br />I read JM Coetzee's Boyhood recently (about growing up in South Africa in the 40's/50's) and that was interesting literature - Alexandra's Fullers book - from her childhood in the 70's/80's creates a continuity of white colonialist attitudes and the die-hard belief (seen through a child's eyes) that white is right and might. A belief shattered by the Rhodesians losing \\"the war\\". Bobo's story is literature, pure and simple. An excellent read. Her style is unique and like the last reviewer I found the \\"voice\\" and the initial time jumps a little disconcerting - but soon enough was captured by her style as well - it is a stream on childhood consciousness. I recommend Alexandra's other book also - Scribbling the Cat [[ASIN:0143035010 Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier]]
B001ILFUDM|3.0|If I were to prioritize all of my favorite Disney movies from favorite to least favorite, I am afraid \\"Pinocchio: would be down on the bottom third of the list.  Yes it's a classic and the songs, especially \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" are timeless, but this morality tale doesn't hold a candle to other Disney greats such as \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\", \\"Peter Pan\\", \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", and more modern titles such as \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".  Of course it's much better than \\"Brother Bear\\" and \\"Treasure Planet\\".    To be honest I found the first third of the movie quite charming.  I love the opening scenes in which Jiminy Crickett is watching Geppetto interact with Cleo the Fish (my favorite character in the movie), Figaro the cat, and of course, the lifeless puppet Pinocchio.  A lot of love and detail went into the art direction of Geppetto's home and watching all of his wooden works operate is a treat.    My problem with the movie is once the Blue Fairy shows up and makes Pinocchio come to life.  After Geppetto sends Pinocchio off to school the whole thing becomes episodic. There is the Stromboli section followed by the Paradise Island section followed by the Monstro the Whale section, and of course there is Honest John showing up every now and than to temp poor Pinocchio and get him into trouble. Yes I know this is based off a story but I think the best Disney features are the ones with one main villain (Yes I know Alice in Wonderland lacks a central villain but all of the characters are interesting and fun to watch).      Now the blu ray quality here is fantastic but unless you are 13 or under you probably won't have any use for the bonus material.  This movie is Walt Disney's second animated picture and while it doesn't have the fun or charm of \\"Snow White\\" it's still a classic and if you are a collector of all things Disney it's worth owning.  It's just not great compared to the others.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|I'm sorry but I really didn't like this movie. I'm really glad I rented it instead of seeing it in the theater as I planned. The film didn't seem to know what it wanted to be - serious - comedy - camp , so it chose to be all of them. There were parts I found funny but I'm not sure I was supposed to. I did think the woman running next to the truck at about 30 mph was kinda funny. Then it goes into a campy cattle drive which ends in tragedy (again it switches gears). The \\"villain\\" should be wearing a Snidely Whiplash mustache. Anyway if you like it fine. I just didn't care for it.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|\\"Fleet Foxes\\" was not at all what I expected, but it has turned out to be a rewarding investment.  The album began turning up on my Amazon recommendations shortly after I picked up the new Sigur Ros recording.  Seattle's Fleet Foxes have very little in common with the experimental Icelanders, aside from a similar release date and an ear for ambience.  They are a folky, song-based vocal group with relatively short, tuneful songs.  As such, the Fleet Foxes are aligned within a strong tradition of American pop music that allows them to be both nostalgic and timely.<br /><br />The most pervasive influence on \\"Fleet Foxes\\" is \\"Pet Sounds\\" era Beach Boys.  For those with attuned listening, the Fleet Foxes have taken an obvious page from the \\"Smile\\" songbook.  Pulsing pianos, bass and guitars in doubled melodies, textural drumwork, and reflective lyrics delivered in harmony all recall this experimental period in Brian Wilson's career.  Paradoxically, the Fleet Foxes \\"folky\\" undertones seem to trump Wilson's characteristic \\"studio-as-instrument\\" approach.  As a result, the tunes are not quite as orchestral in scope - you will hear no bass harmonica and few radical key changes.  Even vocally, the Fleet Foxes' harmonies are more choral, rather than the tightly harmonized Beach Boys barbershop style.<br /><br />As a part of this American \\"pop baroque\\" music tradition, it goes without saying that the Fleet Foxes are influenced by classic, songwriting-style rock.  It is actually quite difficult, however, to pin down these influences.  At times, there is a hint of Neil Young at his most melancholy or U2 in their more organic stages, or perhaps melodic turns reminiscent of Coldplay.  Additionally, I experienced an expansive, 21st century ambience, which allows \\"Fleet Foxes\\" to exist in a space that is simultaneously otherworldly and tangible, organic and ethereal.  As I attempted to specifically pin down exactly who I was hearing in their sound, my list just seemed to grow longer and longer.  I felt like there was just one band that would sum the Fleet Foxes up, but that hypothetical band's identity just kept floating out of reach.<br /><br />Then I realized - perhaps they are a genuinely original voice expressing something new within a well-defined genre.  All music comes from somewhere, and although Fleet Foxes can be perceived as derivative, they wear their influences on their collective sleeves in a unique pastiche.  This is true in the literal sense, as well.  The CD comes in a LP-ish sleeve with a vignette of sorts written by lead singer Robin Pecknold.  He talks about the uncanny ability for music to indelibly stamp parts of our life experience, citing personal experiences with recordings by the Beach Boys and Radiohead.  His observations certainly ring true, and the artists that he uses as examples in the story definitely loom largely in the Fleet Foxes' sound.<br /><br />THE LOWDOWN:  As the liner notes suggest, some recordings stamp our experiences in unexplainable ways.  \\"Fleet Foxes\\" has already seemed to do that for this time of my life, and I feel fortunate to have stumbled across an album that has that potential.  While I suggest all of the tracks for one reason or another, a single \\"sample\\" listen will not do.  This is an album to be lived with to be really appreciated.elt like there was just one band that would sum the Fleet Foxes up, but that hypothetical band's identity just kept floating out of reach.

B000F6IOC0|4.0|Evolution is the second of the Underworld Trilogy, and a very fine addition it is. The action is awesome, the chemistry between Selene and Micheal was great. Seeing Micheal's Hybrid form in action was a highlight for me, as well as learning more about the back story between the Vampires and Lycans.<br /><br />All in all, a most satisfying movie. If you loved the first one, you'll love this one too.

B00005JNX0|4.0|Caught Madagascar on TBS, sadly complete with commercials.  Great entertainment about city bred animals, and one particular zebra who wants to escape to the Wild, which might be just south of Connecticut!<br /><br />It's collision of friendship and predator instincts makes for an unusually gripping conflict.<br /><br />The most fun for me was the allusions to TV shows and old movies.  If you watched Twilight Zone and Planet of the Apes, even Chariots of Fire and Wild Kingdom, you'll know what I mean.  How many can you spot!<br /><br />It would be a fun Lunch game to see how many allusions you can spot.<br /><br />The story is  cute, kids will like it.  And adults will recognize a lot of music and movie allusions.  Great way to waste a couple of hours.  Can't wait for Madagascar 2.<br /><br />Also recommend:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001NCDFTW Madagascar - Escape 2 Africa (Widescreen)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000UVKGQC The Shrek Trilogy (Shrek / Shrek 2 / Shrek the Third) (Full Screen Edition)]]
6304698682|3.0|Clint Eastwood needs to be credited for making 2 very important Westerns, especially the first, in The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Unforgiven.  Though famous for the spaghetti westerns, filmed in Spain, made by the likes of Dino Delorentis, when Clint turned his own eye to the genre he chose to not only be serious, but to remind us that life in that era was far from glamerous.  With that in mind, he took a crack at remaking Shane.  Sure, there are some significant differents.  Still, the stranger rescuing innocents is right out Shane.  I still found this story to be a little TOO cookie cutter.  When I first saw Shane, I really wasn't sure our hero was going to win the big duel.  In this case, there was no doubt.  I recommend this film with the proviso that you don't expect too much.
0312427646|3.0|Summary: A mobile library van visits Buckingham Palace, where the Queen stumbles upon it and feels obligated to check out a book, even though she doesn't really read books.<br /><br />Review: Cute book. It reminded me of the movie The Queen. You know, because they're both about the Queen.<br /><br />I don't know that this book was my exact cup of tea, but I enjoyed it. And at 120 pages, it was a super-quick read.<br /><br />If you love books and the monarchy, you'll adore this little lovely.
B00005ATQD|1.0|I've seen this movie twice by mistake! I saw it once in 1999 when it came out then I saw it again this year, ten years later because I'd forgotten just how awful it really is. This movie is a bigger dog than Cujo! It's a shame that Stanley Kubrick's legacy was last remembered with this mess. No disrespect to the dead but I have to ask, \\"What was he thinking????\\"    The film has no plot but only a long, long patch of boring, draggy, unrelated scenes strummed together!  Did I mention boring?     The scenery was draggy and pointless. Also I gotta give a big thumbs down for the filmmakers hyping this up as some big sex film. Please! I've seen more erotica on PBS' Masterpiece Theater!  It's obvious that sex-talk was a ploy in '99 to get folks to watch. Even back then it wasn't shocking so today you won't even notice the so-called erotica!    It was way too long and for WHAT? If you're gonna make a long movie do the audience a favor and make sure it's good! Sitting through this was like being tied to the electric chair!    The acting is amazingly horrible! I didn't expect much from the non-acting Tom Cruise. The man's as overrated as Britney Spears!  But I was shocked at Nicole Kidman's terrible performance. Kidman's one of the most amazing actresses of our time!  It's clear to see that the only reason she took part in this mess is because Cruise was in it too. He seemed to spend most of his career begging Kidman to co-star in his films because he could tell they were duds to begin with. Maybe you could pick a hit in the 80's Tom but have been sinking fast in the last twenty years!    If you haven't seen this movie yet, you don't want to NOW. Run, save yourself! Showgirls is better than this! EWS is HORRIBLE!  It has the right title though.  You watch this and your eyes will definitely be wide shut because you'll be sleep!    Eyes Wide Shut is a piece of long, boring, terrible, horrible, trash!    This is the reason Amazon needs to invent zero stars for ratings!

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Chris Nolan movies are starting to grow on me.  The director of Following, Batman, etc., tells a story of a guy who has no short-term memory, who keeps notes all over the place, even tattooing the more important ones, to remember what happened an hour or even ten minutes before.  It's also about a drug-dealing gal who wants to get back at her boyfriend and a few other guys and uses our hero's lack of memory to use him for her own vengeance.<br /><br />It's a story about vengeance and the blocks in the road to achieving it, that even with your handicap you can stay the course.  But what if the course is twisted and you can barely remember the whys and hows of it all?<br /><br />It's about a guy who feels guilty for what he did to a guy who had the same condition and also had a wife who died.<br /><br />Nolan's film is the most unusual cinematic adventure I've ever seen.  It's not your basic action thriller, though there's plenty of both.  It plays backwards.  You get the ending right from the start and then find how he got there.<br /><br />I heard that there is a \\"linear\\" version that goes from the \\"end\\" and moves to the \\"beginning\\", but that would be really dumb.  That defeats the whole premise!<br /><br />Get the DVDs on Amazon, it's a must-own for sure.<br /><br />Other Nolan films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000F3CD Following]]<br />[[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]]<br />[[ASIN:B001WQQWXA Batman Begins, Two Disc Deluxe Edition, Hologram Cover]]

0451169514|4.0|I could go on about the clown, the childhood terror and the sheer horror but I think they've been covered enough.  What It means to me is something different: my first voyage into the horror genre, something that terrified and electrified me to the extent that my reading habits were the never the same.  Thirteen years later and I still cringe when I remember my first reaction to reading IT.  I thought it lost some of the pace towards the end (other I have spoken to disagree) but still, this is the real thing and one of the best in the whole genre.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This opened my eyes - how our planet works in harmony and is a fragile as glass. It's should be mandatory in school to show every young person this video so they can get the knowledge and respect this world deserves.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I started listening to this CD as soon as I bought it.<br />After reading and watching Twilight I was excited to buy the CD.<br /><br />I love most of the song, haven't taken the CD out of my car but to rip it to my iphone.<br /><br />1. Muse - Supermassive Black Hole<br />This is a very cool song, I love the scene it was in when they played bassball, very cool scene and song to go along with it.<br /><br />2. Paramore - Decode<br />Love this song but I wish it was in the movie though, not the credits.<br /><br />3. The Black Ghosts - Full Moon<br />Not sure if I like this song or not.<br /><br />4. Linkin Park - Leave Out All The Rest<br />I hate that they didn't use this song in the movie some place<br /><br />5. Mutemath - Spotlight (Twilight Mix)<br />This was another favorite when all eyes were on the couple as they drove to school together for the first time.<br /><br />6. Perry Farrell - Go All The Way<br />Not sure what to think about this song.<br /><br />7. Collective Soul - Tremble for My Beloved<br />Good song for the car accident scene.<br /><br />8. Paramore - I Caught Myself<br />I love this song, too bad they didn't sure it in the movie, another mistake I think.<br /><br />9. Blue Foundation - Eyes on Fire<br />Not my fav song on the CD but it was ok.<br /><br />10. Rob Pattinson - Never Think<br />It was in a wierd place in the movie but I love it because of the words, once you can understand what he is saying it is a great song. I love Rob Pattinson's music, he has real skills. I hope Rob does more music and hopefully I will be able to buy a CD of just his music in the future.<br /><br />11. Iron & Wine - Flightless Bird, American Mouth<br />It's very romantic & soft, great song for the school dance scene. I like the words and sound of this song, listen to it in the car and at work all the time.<br /><br />12. Carter Burwell - Bella's Lullaby<br />This song wasn't really what I was looking for as Bella's lullaby. When I read the book I imagined something lighter and softer.
031606792X|1.0|A friend recommended Twilight to me. She's one of the \\"OMG EDWARD HOTTIE I HEART VAMPIREZ LOL\\" kind of crew, but I thought,\\"Heck, it's the big thing right now, I don't want to do my homework, might as well skim it.\\"    I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said. The writing was shoddy, Edward's a creeper, Bella's a pathetic yet somehow stuck-up wimp with no personality whatsoever. Remind me what was wrong with Mike?    It's a mixed feeling though...I hate Twilight and I think it would have been so much better if Bella ended up with Jake at the end of Eclipse and Breaking Dawn (shudder) had just never happened.     I couldn't even read the whole thing. I read Jacob's chapters and skipped to the end.    But wow, really, Meyer? He ends up with her DAUGHTER? Is there anything UNhappy about this ending?    If I'd been writing it, they would have skipped the baby entirely, Edward would have gone to change her and lost control like everybody knows he's going to. (birth scene..all that blood and he really doesn't react at ALL?)    Little bunny trail: birth scene. Whoa. I know fourth graders who read this stuff. Two sentences implying sex and then that gorefest. Thanks there, Stephers. I'm going to have that image stuck in my head for awhile.     Back to my version. Jake attacks Edward to stop him from killing Bella and Edward kills him. (There, tragedy) Bella, who really did love Jake, can't stand the sight of him and goes on with her human life.     Fortunately, I'm not even remotely responsible for the creation of this crapsterpiece. If you absolutely MUST read it, then get it from the library. The series should have ended with Eclipse.     Oh, and that happy little claim that it's the next Harry Potter?  FALSE.  As a self-proclaimed Harry Potter nerd, I can quite accurately say that this is nowhere NEAR Harry Potter and never will be. Jeesh.     Bella is one letter from Bela. Haha.     As much as I dislike these books, if Jacob died, it'd break my heart. So I'm glad he didn't. From now on, I'm pretending Breaking Dawn isn't real. May the New Moon remain forever.

1400032717|1.0|It was a good book about how smart someone with autism could be.<br />I however think it wasn't good to be called a Childrens book. The f-word was used again and again. There were blashphemys and graphic depictions of being in the bathroom.<br /><br />I don't recommend it.
1596590688|5.0|While a heavily MBA'ish read, the message in this book is simple: there are many oceans, so why try to fight in the same waters as everyone else. When you own your own business, it is tempting to look at your competitors and emulate them to stay competitive. Yet, this is the wrong thing to do. This book shows you, that the way to be successful it to do something completely different, and create your own ocean, so that you are not fighting over the same market (thus getting your share of the pie). You should be creating your own pie.    Well written, with great examples of blue ocean companies. After reading this, you will be able to spot those firms that follow the Blue Ocean Strategy.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|This album is nothing short of amazing.  Some people say that Trivium can never compare to Metallica.  Well that is simply misfortune of bad timing.  I'll give credit where credit is due, Metallica help lay the foundation for contemporary artists.  But on a strictly level playing field, Trivium has every bit of talent if not more than Metallica!  This CD is a culminating maturation of all the talent this band has to offer!

B000E97X66|5.0|Even at this fairly stage in his career (they were just on the cusp of super stardom thanks to \\"Born To Run\\"), Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band were already well established as the heart stoppin', pants droppin', earth quakin', air conditioner shakin' force of nature that would later ignite record players and more importantly concert stages around the world.<br /><br />This two disc 1975 concert is culled from the first of two legendary appearances at London's Hammersmith Odeon. The energy level on these two cds is brain melting. Bruce and the band blast through hard hitters like \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,\\" \\"It's Hard To Be Saint In The City,\\" (with killer piano work from Professor Roy Bittan), \\"Kitty's Back,\\" (with an epic jam showing off the respective musical talents of each band member, most notably a thrilling jazz excursion by Danny Federici - R.I.P.), \\"Rosalita,\\" the \\"Detroit Medley,\\" and the closing \\"Quarter To Three\\" with jackhammer force, and even slower numbers, such as a dramatically reimagined \\"The E Street Shuffle,\\" \\"4th Of July, Asbury Park,\\" and the haunting piano only version of \\"For You,\\" all have an extra edge to them that makes them superior to their studio version. \\"Born To Run\\" had not yet become the anthem it is today, but Bruce and band sure play it like they know they're going to be playing it every night for the next 34 (and counting years), as this is possibly the most passionate and exciting version of the song ever concocted. \\"She's The One\\" builds to an explosive climax. \\"Lost In The Flood\\" is hair on the back of your neck raising intense. \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Jungleland\\" are absolutely breathtaking in both their beauty and their ferocity.<br /><br />The sound quality on this recording is astounding. You feel like the band is right there in living room, and the audience is audible enough to the point where you feel like your part of a real concert.<br /><br />This is a must have collection for all fans of rock music and Bruce Springsteen.
0312539517|4.0|Paths of Glory may already have been the title for a classic movie by Stanley Kubrick, but that didn't prevent it from being used again as the name of Jeffrey Archer's newest book.  Book and movie have nothing in common, however, besides the title.    Archer's novel is historical fiction, the tale of George Mallory, who may or may not have been the first person to climb to the top of Mount Everest.  Even if he was, however, he never made it down, instead dying near the summit.  This is not a spoiler, as Mallory's death is established in the first few pages in a prologue that deals with the finding of his body in 1999.    After the prologue, we are taken back to Mallory's childhood, where it was obvious that he was obsessed with climbing things and had a real talent for it:  he could find paths up mountains that eluded other people.  As he reached adulthood, he'd mix his pursuit of climbing with the responsibilities of life, including work and marriage.  Journeys from his home in England to the Alps were briefly satisfying, but always Everest loomed over him, the ultimate goal.      Apocryphal or not, it is to Mallory the famous quote \\"Because it is there\\" is attributed in response to a question about why he wanted to climb Everest.  Some limited research I did on Mallory after reading the book showed that Archer has stuck to most of the main facts about Mallory's life, even if he has used his typical writer's flair to liven it up a bit.  With a known conclusion and none of his typical good-vs.-evil material, Archer nonetheless has come up with one of his better recent books, one that should please both his regular fans and those new to him.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|The review's title says it all!! That is what Quantum of Solace is all about. Please watch Casino Royale then this afterwards, as to keep the storyline making complete sense to you! The dvd comes in DD5.1 & , my favourite, DTS5.1! It is non-stop action from start to finish! & yes Bond does stack up quite a body count. Judi Dench is at her best as always & as for, Daniel Craig, he grows on you as James Bond. I do have 2 small \\"gripes\\" though, what criminal organisation meets at an Opera House to conduct business???? & the other the film's theme song really sucked!!! My sincerest apologies & sympathy for the sexy Alicia Keys! Let's hope the pace started in 2006 carries on right through the next Bond flick!!!

B001PA0FFO|4.0|Having seen the play on tour with the original Broadway lead actor, Cherry Jones, I was anxiously awaiting this release. In a somewhat different way, Meryl Streep is exceptional in the film's lead role. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is equally brilliant in his role. But the film lacks some of the tension of the stage production, whose cast consisted of just four actors. Playwright John Patrick Shanley \\"opened\\" of the story with his film adaptation. He added many more characters - quite a few are superfluous - and brought it outside the Catholic School. More importantly, he added extra events that seem contrived. When Sister Beauvier (Streep) does something wrong there is a clap of thunder - or the lights go out. When Shanley wants to build suspense he brings in a strong wind. He wants the viewer to know that God is \\"not pleased\\" or \\"Something terrible is about to happen\\". These moments are so obvious that you are distracted by the IDEAS that Shanley has  put into the words that his characters speak.<br /><br />But let me not dissuade you from seeing this DVD. The acting is SUPERB from all the main characters. The films FIVE Oscar nominations certainly support this. Shanley was nominated - but for the screenplay (well deserved); not as a Director.<br /><br />The bonus features are interesting but often spend a lot of time showing scenes from the film, which you have already seen. This is becoming common practice and a 10 minute \\"featurette\\" will often only have six minutes of new material. I have not taken the time to listen to Shanley's complete commentary track.<br /><br />Highly recommended, specifically for the acting, but also for the script if you have not previously seen the stage version.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B001KNUQ8M|5.0|For CD (or LP) reproduction, no one masters like, or better than, Steve Hoffman.  If you have a good stereo system and care about the warmth of the overall sound, the depth of the sound stage, and the precision of sound separation, this new gold CD is well worth the cost.  This version is even noticeably better than the Japanese reissues, which I also own.  It is the closest that you will have a CD sound like an LP but without the scratches. As a side note, there are only thirteen tracks on this remaster, the original 12 plus one previously issued bonus track (Get Up, Jake).
B00006I53S|5.0|This lens was an excellent value and is a perfect all around main camera  lens to keep on your camera 90% of the time. You'll find this lens can be used  for many different photo shots.

Gilmour is in absolute top form on this release.  His guitar playing is outstanding.
B001TH16DI|1.0|I would advise all out there to avoid this set and maybe Paramount will get the message that the American Buyers of DVD,s meaning Blu Ray are not stupid and Paramoutn must be oblivious to the economy being in the basement like it is and when people are spending good money at least give them something new (Meaning Total Restoration) of the films,and then release these films.Blu Ray was meant to be something special but it has become studios way to just release the same films with same process on blu ray.I dont know if anyone else has noticed but I have started to see scratches on the blu ray disc also what ever manufactuer is making these is also becoming shoddy in there manufacturing of the blu ray discs.

If you never get to marry a red head after seeing this movie... I understand..
0714843377|3.0|\\"Somehow the more you give away the more comes back to you.\\" ~pg. 30<br /><br />The content of this book at first appears to have been written for those working at an advertising agency. However, there are a few out-of-the-box ideas that will boost your creativity no matter which field you work in. The idea of seeking criticism may be unpopular but I can see how it can make you better at what you do. While building a website and reviewing I've often been criticized and I know it made me better at what I do.<br /><br />The author's idea that we are actually all involved in selling something and therefore are all in advertising seems realistic. This book will help creative people become more successful, especially those working with clients who have a mind of their own and already have a vision for what they hope to accomplish.<br /><br />This book is basically about having an open mind that is ready for anything life has to offer. This book is a very quick read but you will probably come away with one main point that can change your life. At the end of the book there are also a few pages of quotes that are inspirational.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B001RTP3Z0|4.0|I totally agree with a previous reviewer who said this is technically disappointing.  That is absolutely correct.  The concert's set list is amazing and the musicians are first class.  However, the video appears to have been done by a bootlegger!  The camera work is not good and the technical aspects of the video leave much to be desired.  For example, the colors are off and the camera work is not up to par.  Other than the questionable technical aspects, the concert itself is fine and Cohen shows why he is still the man!
B001DPC4TG|5.0|The 2009 Warner Bros 180g LP reissue of this classic album is fantastic. There is very little to no surface noise betweem tracks - the music is too loud to allow for surface noise during tracks- and the remastering is excellent. This vinyl version is far superior to the CD in both remastering quality and, of course, overall sound quality. I am very pleased with this purchase!
B001SO6KMY|4.0|A stately big budget period biopic, loaded with well choreographed, shot and edited fight scenes, of the martial artist widely credited for bringing Wing Chun kung fu from southern China to Hong Kong in the early twentieth century, and whose concepts and training ideas were adapted by his most famous student, Bruce Lee, who promoted those ideas as, \\"the way of the intercepting fist,\\" in his book, \\"The Tao of Jeet Kun Do.\\" The film clearly emulates the scope of the Jet Li film, \\"Fearless\\" - which was about the redemption of the martial arts fighter, Hua Yuan Jia, who (at least in the heavily fictionalized \\"Fearless\\") overcame a egotistical brutality to leave behind a similarly impressive legacy in the worldwide spread of the JingWu school of martial arts and general physical education (a kind of YMCA offering kung fu training as well as other forms of physical education in several countries).  The film is also noteworthy for Donnie Yen's atypically restrained performance as Ip Man, a wealthy martial artist, who lived in a town filled with good teachers, and resisted the Japanese colonial government in southern China, when they pressured him to teach japanese soldiers, resulting, ultimately in the historical Ip Man having to flee occupied China, and emigrate to Hong Kong, where he eventually began teaching to make a living (something most martial arts film fans might know going into the film).    However lacking the character arc Ronny Yu and the makers of \\"Fearless\\" imposed on the life story of Hua Yuan Jia (critics rightly point out Donnie Yen's Ip Man is nothing less than a living saint, and doesn't evolve at all as a character throughout the film) the filmmakers wisely make up for it by developing secondary characters drawn from the community Ip Man lives in before the Japanese invasion.   Some are forced to become collaborators with the occupation government, others are forced into matches with Japanese martial artists, others join tongs like the Axe Gang, whichpreyed on chinese civilians during the long period of the occupation and the chinese civil war.  All of these lives intersect with the newly dispossessed and impoverished Ip Man as he tries to survive, feed and defend his young wife and child, against the depredations forced on the southern chinese by the Japanese occupation, and eventually finds himself taking on challenge matches against japanese fighters, at first, to get food for his family, and then later, as a matter of principle.     That aside, the film is chock full of good-to-great martial arts fight scenes, including friendly (and some not so friendly) matches between members of the Fo Shan Mountain's large community of martial artists before the Japanese invasion, and increasingly desperate battles afterwards, between struggling workers and gangsters, starving martial artists and japanese soldiers, and publicized challenge matches against Japanese martial artists set up to further humiliate the oppressed population.   Though I do think fight choreographer Sammo Hung, and Yen didn't quite manage to get across the efficiency and sheer finesse exhibited by real masters of the style (possibly better seen in two earlier wing chun-based films he directed, \\"Warriors Two] and \\"Prodigal Son\\"), Hung deserves a lot of credit for choreographing the increasingly brutal fight scenes in a way that shows how Wing Chun differs from other styles of chinese and japanese martial arts.   (A much more detailed discussion of the major fight scenes is up at kungfucinema.com [...] for those with a strong interest in the technical side of these things.)  I particularly liked the performances of Yen (again, far more disciplined and restrained than usual), Louis Fan as a northern stylist, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as a Japanese General, Xing Yu and Chen Zhihui, as Fo Shan Mountain martial artists.    \\"Ip Man,\\" is definitely worth seeing, and while it it doesn't quite match the dramatic strength of \\"Fearless,\\" the writers and filmmakers havecrafted an interesting enough, well produced narrative to actually sit through the segments between the fight scenes, which is saying a lot these days. \\"Ip Man, Part I\\" has made pretty serious money (a sequel covering Ip Man's years in Hong Kong has been greenlit - I'm already looking forward to seeing who wins the big fight over who gets to play the young Bruce Lee) and I hope, along with \\"Fearless\\" it leads to more big budget period kung fu films with (hopefully) better and more interesting narratives than the usual \\"theatre of revenge\\" fare.  Judging from all the big budget period war movies (like \\"Red Cliff I and II,\\" \\"Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon,\\" \\"The Warlords,\\" \\"Seven Swords,\\" \\"An Empress and The Warriors,\\" \\"A Battle of Wits\\" coming out of China these days, it's clear the Chinese are willing to spend the money ... there's a good chance we'll also get more films like \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Ip Man.\\"  Certainly there are no lack of candidates, (Wong Fei Hung, Yang Luchun, the Chen Family, Dong Haichuan, Yueh Fei, .. the list goes on) for cinematic canonization in the long, long history of Chinese martial arts.

0061139378|4.0|I decided to read this book before I saw the movie (which I still haven't seen, but that's beside the point), because typically if you do the opposite, it kinda ruins the book. I'm somewhat familiar with Gaiman and his dark, almost Tim Burtonish style, and Coraline fit right in.<br /><br />The story features Coraline, who most people call Caroline because they misunderstand her name. She lives in an apartment building with her parents who, though loving and kind, are a bit distracted and busy and thus can sometimes ignore Coraline. Two other tenants live in the building, a crazy old man who runs a \\"mouse\\" circus out of his apartment, and two elderly has-been-celebrity ladies. One day, while bored, Coraline discovers a door in her living room, and asks her mother what it goes to. Her mother tells her \\"nothing,\\" then unlocks it to show Coraline it leads to a brick wall, then explains that beyond it is an empty, unrented apartment, and that the apartment building used to be one, giant house that the owners separated into several apartments.  Later that day, her mother has to go out, and so Coraline uses the opportunity to unlock the strange door again. Only this time, instead of a brick wall, there is a hallway. Coraline goes through it to discover a mirror world basically identical to hers, with a mother and father who look just like hers--except their eyes are big, black buttons. The world provides Coraline with everything she's ever wanted--food she likes, a colorful bedroom and, most of all, a sense of individuality and self-expression. But, while the strange alternate world seems fun and exciting to Coraline at first, she eventually discovers its dark side--and the drawbacks to having \\"everything you ever wanted\\"--and must plan an escape back to the \\"real\\" world.<br /><br />Coraline is a wildly imaginative and fun story--but I would be wary to read it to young kids. This is definitely for the 8/9 or older crowd, just because of some of the topics (like, for instance, dead children, missing parents, or sewing buttons onto your eyeballs). I was reading Stephen King when I was about 10 years old, and I think I came out okay, so I have nothing against letting children read dark stories, but I think it could cause some nightmares in the younger crowd.en, missing parents, or sewing buttons onto your eyeballs).

B000K7VHQE|3.0|This is a funny and touching movie with a sharply observed script and fine performances from all the cast. Although deceptively slight on plot there is plenty to enjoy during the insanely hapless road trip and the excruciating beauty pageant. And the journey is, of course, a cathartic one for all concerned. My only criticisms are that the quirkiness of the characters is a little clich&eacute;d and the ending a little too self-consciously feel-good. But these small faults detract little from its overall success.

B000QQZSOQ|5.0|When I recall what a chance encounter it was that led me to buy this album (a copy of a local music news rag left on a table at a technical conference I attended at the hotel in Orlando's Florida Mall in 1996, which had an interview with Steve Morse on the front page), I absolutely dread to think that I might have missed even one or two years of knowing this music.  Oh, I'd have eventually had to check it out, already being a Deep Purple afficionado, of course, but how long would I have waited knowing that they had a new guitarist that had once been in Kansas (shudder)?  There are still aspects of Steve Morse's style that are just too 80's for me, but he had to be the guitarist for this album - it appears that he was an important part of the creative effort and he did extremely well.  I'm not saying he was THE shining star of the effort, of course, because it took all of the band to do this and I'm especially glad that Jon Lord had not yet departed the group.  Bottom line - I could play this every day and it would never sound stale.  I literally have 3 copies of the disk - I bought 2 extras at used CD stores when I realized I was in danger of wearing my first copy out.  Thankfully, in recent years I've stored the album on my computer and MP3 players, so the music is now safe and sound.  I'm relieved to see that there are other reviewers able to hear the genius in this album - even though it does not appear to have ever been discovered by the masses, those who love it do so intensely!  My only regret is that I didn't see Deep Purple when they toured for this album.

B000059XUP|3.0|As a fan of Eric Proyas \\"The Crow\\" (1994) and James O'Barr's graphic novel I was somewhat hesitant to view the follow-up, especially since it received such poor reviews. I didn't want my enjoyment of the first film to be tarnished by a mediocre sequel, but I figured, \\"what the heck\\" and went ahead and rented it. While at first I considered Tim Pope's \\"The Crow: City of Angels\\" (1996) to be a huge disappointment, especially when one compares it to the original, in all honesty, it's not that bad of a film and it has its redeeming qualities.<br /><br />The cinematography is somewhat of a mixed-bag. While the original film was dark and bleak, it was done with elegance and style, \\"City of Angels,\\" by contrast with its intrusive soundtrack and heavy-handed glumness, can come across as cartoonish--like a B horror movie or a Marilyn Manson/Rob Zombie video. Still, the post-apocalyptic vision of the future with its barren, hopeless, filthy  landscape is captivating.<br /><br />While the plot is essentially just a rehash of the first movie, except a father/son are the murdered victims instead of a couple, the father's devotion is touching.  The gang of bad guys (with the exception of Iggy Pop) are mostly mostly faceless, although the chief bad guy, (some bald dude) with his narcissistic, psychopathic personality is kind of interesting.  The ending is somewhat confusing and disappointing, with the main villain  taking away all of the Crow's power only to be overtaken by a flock of crows? Huh? Although the last scene, with the Crow and his son going to \\"a better place\\" is good way to conclude the film.<br /><br />As for the character of the Crow himself , while Brandon Lee's character was funny, savage and human, Vincent Perez (as Ash) in this film comes across as a soap opera actor, a good lucking guy with a wooden delivery going through the motions. Mia Kirshner, the Crow's love interest, serves no real purpose to the storyline and her death at the end is entirely pointless to the narrative.<br /><br />\\"City of Angles\\" best character is Iggy Pop, as the vile thug \\"Curve\\" and is easily as good as \\"Tin Tin\\" or \\"Funboy\\" from the original movie. I also enjoyed the scenes of the Crow (the actual bird, not Perez) in flight--some very cool cinematography there.<br /><br />A commercial and critical failure, \\"The Crow: City of Angels\\" pretty much torpedoed the Crow franchise, with next few movies going straight-to-video. Still, this film isn't bad and while obviously not the original, is worth renting if you liked the fist movie.\\"City of Angles\\" best character is Iggy Pop, as the vile thug \\"Curve\\" and is easily as good as \\"Tin Tin\\" or \\"Funboy\\" from the original movie.

B000SEHG5U|5.0|I agree with Richard that not only Christianity, but many religions are \\"jealous and proud of it;  petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freaks; vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleansers; misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bullies\\" but I would argue that science, nature - and we are, as well. Whoever created this mess worked all of that right into the very fabric of our lives and were we to overcome it, we would have to reform nature and ourselves in the process. Maybe that's where we're headed. I don't know if we could totally do that, but we could minimize the damage & pain as much as possible and attempt to evolve and improve the lives of the what's around us. Maybe we can find a way to separate the \\"Hyde\\" part from the \\"Jekyll\\" and express it in positive alternative ways that aren't harmful to anyone.    But wouldn't we have to admit that science itself is brutal? It's treatment of animals, who clearly can feel pain, have desires and suffer greatly in laboratories - for all kinds of scientific purposes. They have a brain and nervous system, and so feel the pain we feel, they often die unable ever to lead lives free of unwanted handling and suffering, they cannot even speak up for themselves to tell us of their agonies. Do scientists love the nature they study or would they brutalize any creature for any bit of knowledge they can obtain?  We would have to reform science to be truly loving people as well. I think the revolution for animals is the next great act of love. Just like our society once depended on slavery of African Americans for the economy, for the pleasure of whites, and for the purposes of whites, or women for the purposes of men, unpaid labor, sexual exploitation, and \\"subjection in all things\\" (slavery) so also animals today are tortured to varying degrees for our own needs. Our happy meal isn't that happy. Unlike human beings, they are not our equal in intellect, so we have to fight for them, since they cannot fight for themselves. One way to solve our own brutality - outlaw the use of animals for any other reason than companionship, including experiments on animals for our benefit, eating of them for meat, or killing of them for any other \\"products\\" we can use them for. Wrenching animals away from their \\"masters\\" may be as difficult as wrenching slaves away from our ancestors was. (I'm talking about animals in meat factories etc... not companion animals - to wrench domestic animals away would be cruel and traumatic to them.)   Or maybe it wouldn't be hard to change people's minds after all. We may all see the need for it.     We can also stop calling ourselves \\"owners\\"  of animals and nature, but \\"guardians\\" and \\"caretakers\\" and then live up to our own new vision of ourselves. We can change our experience of life into powerful gentleness. Instead of the small serving the powerful, we can reverse it and have the powerful serve the small.     Religion same thing. Speaking as someone who was hurt badly by the experience of the religion I was inflicted with and had (and still have) a lot of trouble shaking free of it (and the hatred I sometimes feel for the people that did it to me - I'm working on it) I would have to say that that part of the book is absolutely true - religion and cruelty of human nature. Raising little girls in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam is like raising a little African child in the Ku Klux Klan. The hatred can permeate your whole life, become a part of your sexuality and form your future. What little there is of it in many cases. Many times hidden, many times afraid to even acknowledge it, or even unaware of it, women get used to the shame and pain and there are often grave consequences (social, political, familial) for those who try to break free or fight back. There's a lot of fear. It effects your sexuality - like pavlovs dogs and the bell, many women respond to shame and pain they are used to, we connect acts of aggression to our person as part of our sexual lives and learn to get a level of pleasure from it. And saying it hurts or offends you on some deep level is not often permitted by our culture. The power structure is invested in it too much. When I was young my first introduction to sexuality was a book on \\"purity\\" that told me about \\"submission\\" and \\"subjection\\" was the role for women - not love, not equality, not gentleness or kindness - power plays of men  - with them always the winner of course. Boring and ugh. It immediately became part of my sexual life and I've felt uncomfortable with my sexuality ever since. I do believe it's possible to change your sexual preferences, because I've been working on it and succeeding sometimes.  Perhaps science could help many of us who have the same problem do that. Why isn't love sexy? Why do many of us not get ecstasy from gentleness, kindness and exchange of equal strength and love? Could we change it? And why can't religion do that as well, instead of selling us power-plays and torture disguised as love? You're right, sadomasochism is the character of our world, which is formed in large part by our religions. It seems very sad to me that it's the main part of our lives, that we raise children who trust us in it.    Ideas:    Maybe a diverse religion that placed gentleness and kindness truly at the top of the list of values and lived it, with every sex and race represented would help our culture. We don't have to be against religion as a celebration of emotion, art and \\"deep play.\\" If people know how to control themselves it all can be good.  It seems to fulfill a human need for gathering, ritual, music, a place to meditate work on their values etc.... it's a deep experience and why it's powerful. Maybe we shouldn't try to destroy the old ones so vehemently, but create new ones that fulfill those needs. Maybe we can gain control of it instead of it controlling us. Religion could serve the good in humanity if we had a new one.     So could science be used far more for positive goals. Science creates forces of destruction, but imagine if science was dedicated to creating \\"weapons\\" that were non-destructive and non-lethal, systems of defense that protected the small without doing harm to the environment or others, ways to transform the lives of the creatures who have been created and are suffering because of the design of their bodies, or their \\"place\\" in nature. We could use more of THAT kind of science.     Far-fetched maybe, but could we develop a vegan diet for carnivorous animals that nourished them and was not harmful to them, so we didn't have to feed them products from meat factories?  Could we do it without harming the animals we tried it on? I wish scientists would work on many gentle goals like these. Could we improve the lives of animals in the wild who are preyed upon and live in fear - would it be right to do it?     Do these questions seem silly to some? Maybe it's because some science is as \\"hard\\" and cruel as the religion it condemns. When scientists want to insult  a theory it's called \\"soft science\\" - News same thing - softness, kindness, love are all equated with \\"wrongness.\\" Because people at the top (sexist and/or racist men and some of the women they have trained) have claimed \\"hardness\\" for certain men, taking their sexual metaphors to extremes in all of culture, repeatedly connecting their sexuality to cruelty and destruction, and women's to softness, kindness something that does not have to be true at all. We can all be strong and kind.  But  in this way they create an inherent, great injustice that flows through everything and makes a lie of love when they do happen to talk of it. What if the people at the top were men and women and all races who didn't buy into that, who trasformed it? I think we can create real love - and science, religion, art - everything can serve that goal. The highest parts of ourselves can triumph. Intelligence to serve love, power to serve love, imagination to serve love, knowledge to serve love.

This gym was great in his newborn months but he did outgrow it fairly quickly.  He absolutely loved the hanging butterflies, which we also attached to the velcro on his Graco papasan.  We were able to use for tummy time and on his back.  This gym is great as a \\"starter\\" but, as some previous reviews noted, won't last beyond the time they can roll over.  I would buy and use it with a second baby, though.  The size was great for not cluttering up a room and for bringing on travel.
0452289963|5.0|After reading the reviews, it's a bit humorous that a number of those who claim to fully understand this book's concept are so deeply consumed by their ego they've failed to observe that their own review proves they've completely missed the point.  The fact is that regardless of your level of awareness, this book offers something for everyone.  I've read it a number of times and each pass through opens many new points of awareness.  In fact after reading it the third time, my entire life changed in a few days simply based on a new perspective I hadn't previously seen.    Even if you have no beliefs (and lucky you if this is case, which you'll understand upon reading), you'll find something of value tucked into the pages.  No need to let another's judgmental review make your decision--if you are drawn to the book for any reason, you are ready for the message it holds for you.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|This is not a chick flick, but women will love it. It is action packed for the men. It is a movie for both genders, whose attention will be held throughout. Just when you think the movie is over, it continues with events not exactly predictable. The characters lead you on a learning curve of diverse cultures of the day. I love both action and historical novels. I personally rate this movie as one of the best I have ever seen, if not the best.
1579125549|2.0|I was quite disappointed with this book. No doubt there is a wealth of information and problems in it, but the quality of the pages and the font that the book is typeset in makes it less usable than it deserves to be. Firstly the paper quality is sub-par. Combine this with the (and I apologize for not knowing the right word here) typeface or font of the images used to portray the pieces are poor and in some diagrams it is hard to differentiate, for instance, the white queen from the black queen.<br /><br />Last but not least, the notation used for the games is, to say the least, bizarre. It is not in standard chess notation, instead each move shows a little icon for the piece and then the notation of where the piece has to move to. Combine this with the poor choice of paper and font and it is practically unusable without substantially more effort on the part of the reader than is necessary.<br /><br />I'm in two minds on whether to return the book or persevere since the material is highly useful.<br /><br />If other editions does not have these problems (A correspondent says that his European hardcopy does not have these shortcomings) then you should get that edition instead.
B001RQ0SJO|1.0|Nothing unique here. Same old simplistic pop that corporations love to sell to suckers. Not much different than Brittany Spears. A cute chick giving customers what they want. There have been tons of bands like this. The corporations have decided to make her a star, so they get her name in the papers.    This is all about aura. Dress her up. Get out the spooky lights. Put a violin in there and act like it's serious stuff. This is not virtuosity nor compositional talent. If you like it fine, but someone has to tell the truth even if it does shatter your graven images.     Corporations have to pump out the \\"new\\" so people can think they are on the \\"edge.\\" There is a new sensation every week. Most disappear in a year or so. Here today gone tomorrow, profits banked. One day you will look back and think \\"what was the big attraction???\\" See \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" a similar band from the 60s. There have been thousands. The reason they can do it is you haven't seen enough bands to know there is nothing new here.

The Dualshock 3 isn't as powerful as the Dualshock 2, but that's so the batteries don't drain fast. Speaking of batteries, you don't need to keep spending on outside batteries like for the Xbox 360. It's rechargeable and it lasts 10 hours or more.

0312370849|4.0|I recommend this book for an introduction to a period of history that many people may know nothing or very little about, with regard to the French involvement. The short chapters kept the pace moving, and the story told from Sarah's point of view was compelling.  The alternate storyline was predictable and less interesting.  As others have noted, the story lost a lot of momentum when the alternation ended.  It reads like a first novel, but it is still a book I recommend for its revelation of this tragic event.
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|Contrary to what I've been told, this is the latest in a line of albums that have a couple of catchy songs while the rest are their usual adult contemporary snooze-fest... At the urging of friends who are believers, I tried to give it a fair chance with repeated listenings in different scenarios: in the car, with headphones, loud over large speakers... it's just boring and not exceptional in any way. Let's face it- they'll never be worthy of being compared to U2... but perhaps when they release a \\"Best Of\\" compilation, they will finally be capable of an album that one can play from start to finish without losing interest.

B0000025KI|4.0|The River captures Bruce Springsteen at an interesting crossroads. He's evolving from the introspective, quiet songwriter on \\"Born to Run\\" into the confident celebrity behind the pop-oriented \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" As such, this album features a mix of both types of songs. \\"Hungry Heart\\" and \\"Sherry Darling\\" have the same singalong qualities of his future work, while tracks like \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Drive All Night\\" are beautifully sentimental ballads. There's even a taste of the helplessness he would delve into with Nebraska, thanks to numbers like \\"Stolen Car\\" and the tragic closer \\"Wreck on the Highway.\\" The title track includes some of Springsteen's best lyrics, while \\"Fade Away\\" manages to be both irresistible and heartbreaking. Even the lighter songs like \\"Out in the Street\\" and \\"Crush on You\\" are excellent. There's hardly a dull moment on this record, which is an amazing feat for any double album. Though the overall production could be tighter, The River is one of his best records, since it has Springsteen and the fantastic E Street Band showcasing so many of their styles so effectively. 4 Stars.
B001N26GFM|5.0|There are a good number of well-written reviews posted here, mostly from folks who think this is a very good to excellent film. I count myself amongst them.     I will start out by acknowledging some of the criticism of the film in regards to the age of the young German boy and that by that age, he would have been intuitive enough to know what was going on behind the electrified fence. For those of us who make films (I'm an indy guy myself), try and find a young child who is 5 or 6 who can pull off the depth of the performances these young boys did in this film. Ain't easy, is it? So, while I agree-- to a point-- I understand the necessity of their age and I do feel the story transcends that.     I also disagree with some of the reviewers who think this is brave filmmaking. It's not. It's good filmmaking and an excellent story but I see no bravery in this effort.     Okay, now that I've been honest in the flaws I see, I must again applaud the performances of these two young men. I knew nothing of them before I saw this film but I am looking forward to any opportunity to watch either of them again. I also thought the film was well-made and that the slight twist, post tunneling under the fence, was excellent.     This was one of the best new films I have seen in several years and it's a shame it was panned. It doesn't make you feel good, it isn't delightful, it isn't sunshine and bright skies and doesn't have a Cinderella happy ending. It is honest and that buys a lot of my respect. Go see it or better yet, buy a copy.

B00005JPSM|4.0|This space is usually reserved for reviews of serious political and historical works, various past trends in film and music or the like. Every once in a while, however, this reviewer comes across a quirky little item that requires some commentary. The film \\"The Waitress\\" about the follies and foibles of a pie-crazed mama -to-be was one such effort and the film under review, also centered on food, \\"No Reservations\\" is another. Maybe that is the key to my interest: the question of food; its necessity preparation for survival and those who are devoted to presenting it in its best light. Or maybe it is that although my members of my household, my friends and other whom I know well are aghast at the proliferation of \\"reality\\" television productions they are, to a person, wedded to some reality show called \\"Top Chef\\". Go figure.    In any case that last sentence can serve as an introduction to the story line here. Of course, with any essentially light-hearted cinematic look at the follies and foibles of a top flight chef, in this case a female one played by the fetching Catherine Zeta-Jones, outside the kitchen there has to be some romantic element. Here the boy meets girl line is completed by a new sous-chef played here by Aaron Eckhart. That too figures, although not always, as here, in New York and not always in an upscale restaurant. In short order this pair prove that too many chefs can spoil the pot. Throw in a little imp of a niece who is thrown Zeta-Jones' way after the tragic and traumatic death in an automobile accident of her sister and you have a nice little stew. Working through Zeta-Jones' love life and her new responsibilities to the niece drives the film (with a little assist from an apparently necessary tool for every New York chef- a witty \\"shrink\\").  If food is your thing, and even if it is not, this is a nice little piece of fluff to while away a couple of hours. Try the quail with truffles.
1878424602|5.0|There is an easier way to get what you want from life, involving attunement with nature and the universe. The Best way to put the Law of Giving into operation...is to make a decision that at any time you come into contact with anyone, you will give them something. The Law of Least Effort is based the fact that nature's intelligence functions with effortless ease and abundant carefreeness. Karma and Dharma have been with us for eons, and they form two of Chopra's seven laws above. The Law of Pure Potentiality  is humble and feel superior to noone because it recognises that everyone else is the same self, the same spirit in different guises. If you give, give joyfully. If you want to be blessed, silently bless people by sending them a bundle of positive thoughts. This is the Law of Giving. The Vedic principle  of economy of effort says \\"do less and accomplish more\\". This is the Law of Less Effort. The Law of Intention and Desire occurs through the process of attention and intention. The Law of Detachment says that only from detached involvement one has joy and laughter. Together the 7 laws above become the Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.

0142410314|5.0|Given the popularity of Roald Dahl's classic book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and of the 2005 Hollywood movie by the same name, few readers need a summary of the plotline and characters.  However, less obvious are the valuable economics lessons interwoven throughout this beloved book.  The reader meets Charlie Bucket and his parents and both sets of grandparents in the opening chapter, and quickly learns that this family lives in harsh conditions of poverty, with just one bed in a two-room wooden shack.  Charlie's father supports this household with a low-pay position as an unskilled worker in a toothpaste factory, screwing caps onto toothpaste tubes all day.  The family suffers malnutrition and near starvation, with a diet based mostly on bread, potatoes, and cabbage.  Once a year on his birthday, Charlie is given a chocolate bar, which he savors, morsel by morsel, over the course of an entire month.<br /><br />In contrast, the other four children who win golden tickets to visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory do not know the meaning of scarcity as they come from families with varying degrees of wealth.  Also in contrast to Charlie's wretched living conditions is the presence of Willy Wonka's enormous chocolate factory within sight of his own house.  The reader learns more valuable economics lessons from the tale of why Mr. Wonka decided to close his factory to all workers and other people.  Earlier, \\"spies\\" had leaked secrets of his special production processes to competitors who then proceeded to copy Mr. Wonka and produce the same kinds of delicious and whimsical sweets.  The process of producing chocolate and candies in a factory, and the natural resources used to make the products, are economics lessons that appear throughout the book.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory also teaches about consumers and how they respond to incentives by buying more or less of a product; in this case, news of the five golden tickets causes a surge in consumers' demand for Wonka chocolate bars.<br /><br />Children may think they know the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but chances are they do not realize that they are getting a good dose of economics from start to finish.  This book makes a nice addition to most collections, including those used to teach lessons about poverty, competition, consumers, and producers.chocolate bars.

B0010ZR160|3.0|I came to this film with high expectations, I mean, it had gotten an Academy Award nomination for one of the supporting players, but honestly, I was perplexed as to what was so great about it, I mean, it's a decent yarn, up until the end, but hardly Mystic River.  First let me say, I HATED Casey Affleck in this, his character is so naive and makes the most foolish, obtuse decision at the end, that ruins the film entirely, and Affleck never makes you like or support this yutz, so your just let with thinking, wow, what a moron.  The story is interesting, in a Mystic River sort of way, and the supporting players, starting with Ed Harris are fantastic, I just can help but come back to the way Affleck plays this idiot cop, I just never bought this guy being such a sap and his ruinous decision he makes at the end is positively sickening, and the way it fades to black at the end, is like, uh Ok, is that IT?!...recommended, but not highly, frankly had it had a different lead, maybe it would have been great, who knows.
6302000823|5.0|I've always enjoyed foreign films.  But, my all time 'favorite' is a movie which I watch over and over, and I'm sure when you see this movie you will come to love it as much as I do.<br /><br />Yet, for those of you who might be new to foreign films, CINEMA PARADISO is the movie to watch!<br /><br />How appropriate then that this movie is for those who of us who love going to the movies.<br /><br />CINEMA PARADISO opens when the main character, a famous Italian filmmaker, Salvadore, learns that his mentor and beloved friend, Alfredo has died.  From the beginning, this emotional story is a 'tear jerker'.<br /><br />The movie unfolds as Salvadore recalls his childhood growing up a small Italian town, and he begins to remember how he came to love the movies, and how going to the movies was the center of life for himself and the people who lived there post World War II.  But more, CINEMA PARADISO tugs at our hearts as we are brought along to watch Salvadore grow up.  We will witness his fascination with the movies, his mischiefs with the town priest, and his childhood antics.  Most enjoyable, we will watch how mesmerized young Salvadore ['Toto'] becomes with the projection booth at the town's only cinema.<br /><br />Even more powerful is the bond which grows between young Toto and the amiable 'father figure', theater projectionist, Alfredo.  Viewers will laugh, cry, and rejoice with these two characters.  And, we will witness how young Salvadore/Toto is transformed from a bothersome yet curious child to a handsome and successful filmmaker. Most of all we will be with him during the most important moments in his life: when he rescues Alfredo, when he  films his first movie, and ... when he falls in love!!<br /><br />I recommend that you rent the original American release.  Later, rent or purchase the DVD, which has the both the original and the full version with the directors cuts included.<br /><br />CINEMA PARADISO is MUST for all movie fans.<br /><br />I'm confident that you will surely enjoy it.

B000007OY0|5.0|There have been many excellent reviews of the award winning movie, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.<br /><br />Most reviews of this film adaptation of Stephen Kings short story, allow readers a glimpse of how the main character [played by Tim Robbins] finds eventual 'redemption' despite the horrors he suffered when convicted then incarcerated for twenty years for a murder he did not commit.<br /><br />Many of America's top movie critics and other reviewers point out repeatedly how Robbins' character, Andy, clung to hope - a hope, which in the end was dramatically depicted through his courageous escape.  And to a lesser extent, the notion of 'redemption' was also realized by the character, Red, played superbly by actor, Morgan Freeman when he remembered the words of his friend, Andy - \\"Get busy living, or get busy dying.\\"<br /><br />Yet, less often did we read about a more troublesome type of 'redemption'. And that was the 'redemption', which was borne of despair and which sent character Brook Hatlen [played admirably by veteran actor James Whitmore] to his death.<br /><br />I've participated in counseling for the elderly; seniors who when faced with loss of purpose, loss of belonging, loss of the ability to remain minimally independent, and who suffer loss of health/spouse/family, etc., the pain of despair sets in.  For many of the elderly, this sense of loss often becomes grave, and it becomes all consuming in the depths of their souls.  Then, many become emotionally tormented because their despair becomes devastating for the human spirit to thrive - at the moment when they acquiesce all 'hope'.<br /><br />Finally, gripped by fear and the pang of loneliness, the desire to 'give up'; to die  becomes both urgent and intense.  And, it is in this context that the character Brook Hatlen [through surrender] found 'redemption' - paradoxically, AFTER he was freed from Shawshank.<br /><br />How tragically sad.<br /><br />Maizie James<br /><br />April 12, 2009
B001PA0FF4|3.0|I missed Doubt in theaters and have been looking forward to watching it on DVD. The acting by Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams is outstanding as expected, but the movie itself didn't really amount to much at all. It was shorter than I thought it would be (around 100 minutes) and the resolution while realistic, made the movie feel more like a waste of time. Call me crazy, but Viola Davis didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for less than ten minutes of screen time. I had high hopes for this one and even though I did like the film (thanks to the acting), I can't say that I would watch it again or encourage anyone I know to go out and rent it.
1400063515|5.0|Though purportedly a book on skeptical empiricism by an author who clearly has an axe to grind, it is actually a lot more than that.  In a broad sense this book looks at our habit of perpetually coming up with all kinds of little theories and models of reality, and how they can lead us astray.  While Taleb does not disparage knowledge per se, he does warn us about taking it too seriously.  Reality is not so elegant and neat as our equations and models would have us believe.  It is forever changeable and our equations and theories can only give us rough approximations of it.  If we mistake the approximations for the reality then we get into trouble with the Black Swan, that unpredictable event or thing that our models had all but ruled out and which we are thereby unprepared to handle.<br /><br />Taleb characterizes this tendency of ours as Platonicity, he explains at length the problems with it, and takes us to its logical conclusion:  the bell curve and the tragic consequences of overusing it.  The book  came out in early 2007 and it would have been clear to anyone in the financial industry who read it and \\"got it\\" about the pile of dynamite they were sitting on and the not so hidden dangers in the way they were \\"managing\\" risks.  Unfortunately the message didn't get out on time, we had a financial meltdown that erased decades of profit by the financial industry and brought the world economy to the verge of collapse, which will take many years for us to recover from it.  It may have helped to get the message across if he hadn't been so dismissive and even contemptuous of these folks, but he did his job pointing out that the emperor had no clothes.<br /><br />In the process of explaining all this he takes us on a highly entertaining adventure through his lifestory and reflections, starting with his upbringing in Amioun, Lebanon, (fictional) author Yevgenia Krasnova, his own success as a hedge fund manager, the difference between the ignorant but streetsmart Fat Tony vs. the nerdy but clueless Dr. John, Helenus the seer, who could predict the past (a lot harder than it seems) the insights of the great (still living) mathematician Mandelbrot, and many more.  I think these vignettes are what truly make this book, as they entertain, provide grounding for abstract conecpts that would otherwise be too difficult to explain, while at the same time exemplifying the author's empiricism.  It is ironic that while he criticizes possessors of knowledge, the broadness of his scholarship and literary style shows that he knows and has read quite a few things himself, and while he shows particular scorn for bankers and financial people, he has done very well for himself with the hedge fund he manages, which makes his arguments all the more effective.  Taleb is like the gentleman scholars of old, the type of intellectual there used to be from Greek and Roman times through the early twentieth century, successful in the affairs of the world to an extent that it gives him the leisure to pursue and reflect on many fields of knowlege (a philosopher in the true sense) and gain broad vision and insight, which they then communicate to a broad public, much unlike our contemporary crop of specialists, who see the trees and miss the forest, and their findings only make sense to other specialists.  Even if you disagree with his conclusions you are bound to learn quite a few things and get an intellectual boost few contemporary books can give you.vs. the nerdy but clueless Dr. John, Helenus the seer, who could predict the past (a lot harder than it seems) the insights of the great (still living) mathematician Mandelbrot, and many more.

0312427999|5.0|I recently finished reading this book, and I would say that it opened my eyes quite a bit.  I had read some of Friedman's doings, his economic policies, had even taken a class on it.  But it wasn't until I read this book that I realized what kinds of damage his ideas could have.  Violent oppression to make a few people rich?  Putting our military under private organization answerable to no one?  It made me curious about Keynes ideas and now am firmly in that economic camp, a little of this and a little of that, moderation in everything and all.  Good book, too bad we live in such a messed up world.

This book will certainly make those of a certain age sigh inwardly at the loss of the handwritten letter although back then they clearly had a more efficient postal service...<br /><br />This book is a delightful and absorbing quick read.  You'll cheer, laugh and perhaps cry a little.  By far the best book I've read this year.

The whole movie was fast paced, no bogging down of the story and all the actors were very good. The music was excellent and I am so excited to see the DVD will be out shortly.  I am going back to see it again on the big screen and to anyone that is reading all the bad comments from people that have not even gone to see the movie, don't be close minded, go see for yourself.  There have been several different versions of Dragonball and this is just another and I loved it.  The next movie is going to start filming in May I think and I am looking forward to more of the Dragonball story.

B0000009RX|1.0|A lot of people are seemingly impressed by weirdness and the social commentary. I can appreciate the weirdness, there are a lot of us who have a very off the wall absurd sense of humour. Zappa is far from unique in this; perhaps a lot of the boring types fail to understand this because they're not that type. I'll take some of the more inventive prog acts from then over this, this is overrated just like Zappa thought the Beatles were overrated. And the music is weirdness packaged as music. It's not clever or interesting. Supersister, the Dutch prog band did it better. I suppose that makes me one of those hippies or perhaps the establishment that the pompous Zappa raved about himself. His own biographer Barry Miles outs him as a pretentious control freak. Whatever, keep the myth alive.

At first, I was a little annoyed with the mindset tone, but now that I've gotten further into the series, it really makes it.  The concept of vampires in this series and the society around them is increadibly unique and very enjoyable.  There is no blood exchange to make a childe and while there is blood drinking, it isn't really off of people.  There is an interesting mix of mythology and modern world that is perfectly seemless.  I have really enjoyed this series.

0790729601|5.0|I have been a fan of Arnold's movies from his Conan days. Yes, as cheesy as they are I still like them. Eraser starts off fast paces and picks up from there. While Arnold is the star of the movie, Vanessa Williams is a star in her own right and made her character believable. I especially like her scene in the zoo. Cornered by a rogue agent who tells her he is working with John (Arnold) she asks him for the secret handshake. While the man is trying to figure out what she's talking about she shoots him in the thigh with the gun concealed in her purse.     This is one of the movies I can watch over and over.

B0015FHDRW|5.0|At first glance, I thought, \\"What the? I knew Green Day went under a pseudonym for one album and stuff, but this Hot-Tub stuff seems ridiculous! They're obviously going to 'jump the shark'.\\"<br /><br />What can I say? I was wrong. Although the album didn't have the same feel or mood of Green Day's albums, all its music is still lively, fresh, and... well... pretty awesome.<br /><br />What more can I say? If you like Green Day, then you'll love the Foxboro Hot Tubs.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|I've watched horror and drama movies since I was 5, and this one is the strangest by far. It's not really scary, or intense...it's just sick and weird. There's no real story line, just a buncn of teens and adults doing the nasty all the time. However, it was fascinating to watch. The sh_t eathing scene was the most surprising to me, because the audience sees them putting it in their mouths...gross. This movie, though it sounds like it were  made for shock value, on some level was made tastefully. You don't see hard core XXX, but instead great pretend moments. I wouldn't recommend this for most people, but if you've seen it all, like myself, it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. I give this two thumbs up for its bizare content, and the fact that you also feel some what sorry for the bad guys. There are scenes where the women are telling stories to arous others, and the stories are about their s_x life experiences. The audience hears about how these older women were de-flowered by pervs. in their childhood years, so you feel sorry for them being so messed up emotionally. Another reason that I LIKEED this film was it's not that typical male dominating girl mentality (like most movies are about). There is no one gender dominating another, but a strange mix of both being submissive, and abused.  Weird stuff!
B00009RGBS|5.0|I watched this movie so many times I thought I should own it.  It's my all time favorite movie.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|.....Probably the most under rated of the Christian/Rome/Nero dramas ...Robert Taylor is perfect as the Legion Commander ...A young Deborah Kerr is beautiful in her American debut but the star of the movie is Peter Ustinov in probably the best Nero ever filmed...the two disc set is remastered in brilliant color and should be a must in classic movie collection.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|I love Donnie Darko! It's one of my favorite films, and so when the Director's Cut came out, I was super-stoked. But then...let's just say, I was a little disappointed.  Don't get me wrong; this is a great film regardless of what cut you're watching, but I found myself watching the director's cut and wishing for...a little less.      The main difference I think, is the amount of explanation. The theatrical release is very ambiguous, very unapologetic, and very unexplained. I loved it. It forced you to draw your own conclusions, judgments, and explanations for the events of the film. The Director's Cut, probably in an attempt to answer all questions from fans and make sure that the message was not misconstrued, is very clear in its explanations and messages by comparison. And that, for me, kind of ruined the magic and mystery.    Again, this is a fine film, so if this is the only version you watch, you'll probably love it. But I would suggest watching both versions, and deciding for yourself.
B000UAFDP2|3.0|You must have extended memory loaded to play. All copies are the same, so there is no use exchanging it. I was waiting on my second copy when I found a HD forum talking about the loading problem. The forum members determined the problem is the way the disk was authored. The disk looks for enough memory to support the BD Live content even when BD Live is not enabled. I tried the second copy I received and it would not load either. I updated my firmware and it still would not play. I put a flash drive in my Sony BD S350 and the second copy loaded fine. The bottom line is you need to add extended memory to load this disk, whether your player takes an SD Card, Flash Drive, or whatever.    As far as the movie goes, I would have given it 5 stars if not for this issue with the disk. It's a great action flick with great special effects that look even more awesome on blu-ray. Excellent satire of blind alligence to government and military. I didn't read the book, so I don't have a problem with it not being true to the original story.    Highly recommended, just realize you will need to load extended memory to play.
0446402397|5.0|Okay, a bit contrived but overlook that.  Thius is a fascinating novel.  I rarely sucumb to the idea that one can't put a book down but this one got me. The author puts you in a Russia that you may have forgotten about. It is chilling, exciting and memorable.  Give it a shot.
B001N26GFM|1.0|Aweful film.  Either of my suggested titles would have been more appropriate.    Sophie's List is Beautiful:  Overall the movie is sentinmental contrivance that looked like it was put together by amateurs doing their best to combine Sophie's Choice and Life is Beautiful with a little bit of Schindler's List and The Tin Drum thrown in for good measure.  Unfortunately for them, the end product is an utter failure.  It's difficult to watch without laughing.    Curiousity Killed Little Adolf:  The most/only intriguing thing in this waste of celluloid is the boy in the lead.  He looks amazingly like a juvenile Hitler.  So when he gets what gets in the end, it is somewhat uplifting.    The Holocaust was an outrage, the ugliest example of what man in his broken state is capable of.  If you needed this silly movie to understand that, then that is really too sad.
0765316889|2.0|I truly loved the first book, Mistborn. I was sorely disappointed with this second book. The author is a good writer but the pacing of the story was not very good at all. I was getting bored the first two thirds of the story. I felt the author focused too much on the politics and it seems like he was getting sidetracked from the main story plot, which is obviously the well of ascension. Since this is the main plot, why is the first two thirds of the story about how the city is struggling? Secondly, I was getting really annoyed with Elend. I was not even certain why he became such a big focus of the story. I was very frustrated how stubborn Elend was about his views when the problem could have been solved from the very first: kill the father. The silly part of the story involving the kingship was very very dull. Finally, the story then suddenly rushed and rushed to the climax ending. The end was definitely interesting, but I was sad that the author neglected the main plot of the story until the end of the story. The book is titled the well of ascension. Why is it so ignored until the very end? Honestly, it begins near the end of the story. I wished the author began much earlier and stretched out the fun part longer. I was not able to enjoy the book as much as I could have. I truly liked the first book. The whole book was about the mistborn as the title suggests. Second book, I wanted more than what the author gave.
0399226907|5.0|This is a classic children's book. My son loves it so much. The other day he had a tummy ache and asked me to bring him a green leaf :)
B001FB55M6|5.0|First of all, this isn't a \\"classic\\" Jim Carey movie (Ace Ventura, The Mask, Batman, etc).  I would compare it to Spanglish, where it's funny but not in the same ways as a typical Adam Sandler movie.  But there are moments in this movie where the \\"crazy\\" Jim Carey shows up.  The movie is well done, although predictable in some ways (it's a bit of a date movie some would say).  If you liked Liar Liar and/or Bruce Almighty, then I think you enjoy this movie.    Even if you only rent the movie, it is definately worth the money.    Blu Ray playback was flawless for my set up (LG Blu Ray Drive and Power DVD 7.3, Windows Vista).  I wish I had surround sound tho. . . .
0810995522|5.0|This is the second book from the latest popular \\"teen\\" series called \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\". This series has been haunting me for a while (not to mention it has been in my wishlist since it was in the top ten list everywhere I looked). I jumped at the opportunity when I saw it on sale at Best Eastern, Gadong (a local bookstore); to get a copy of it. True to its name, what I've stumbled through the pages of this book, is a written form of a diary. Every chapter is a day to day entry by Greg Heffley, who is often ridiculed by his brother for owning a diary though it is a project provided by his mother, who has made him do a year before. (which refers to the first book).<br /><br />Greg is the protagonist and also the narrator of the series. He writes down his thoughts and his daily happenings within daily, which either makes you go \\"aww....\\" or \\"o...k\\" or just plainly makes you laugh. From homework, to girls, school, family and of course everyday odd thing that come along once a while. What tickled me is the way he tries to reason things right for every one of his action, some reasonable and some just absolutely hilarious. For example, his reaction when his mother joined him and his friends in a role-playing game of Magic and Monsters just because his mother is concerned with the \\"violence\\" within the game. And when Greg played a trick on one of his classmate where they all pretended he doesn't exist. Then, there's a party hosted by his big brother, Rodrick, when their parents are away, and he was guilt into becoming Rodrick's accomplice.... some what.<br />To make book more interesting is the way Jeff incorporate comics within every pages, playing the field where pictures could tell a story for itself. There are more to this book where anyone in any age would enjoy. Even the most studborn non-readers would love to finish reading this series.<br /><br />Things I've enjoyed: Reading on how Greg's mind works. It's a hilarious book that won't slow down in any page.<br /><br />Things I didn't enjoy: Knowing I started reading it from the second book instead of the first.<br /><br />Reason for reading: I was curious with all of the hype.<br /><br />Rating: Pretty high. Ages from 9+. There's no offensive words or scenes and it is pretty much an easy book to read.<br /><br />Recommends to: Teens who have difficulty trying to read through a bookjoy: Knowing I started reading it from the second book instead of the first.

B0015XHP4K|4.0|I enjoyed the Rambo Trilogy so much I purchase the latest movie to complete the collection.  The creativity of the action sequences are top notch for its time and the beautiful sceneries in blu-ray certainly enhanced the quality.  If you are looking for plenty action and fun, this is worth it.    My only challenge was the pricing.  The boxset was $32.99 when I purchased it and I realised after that they were individually sold for $9.99.  Then the box set dropped to $24.98 a couple days later.  While I appreciate Amazon's great value and specials it is something to consider.  However, the price of the Rambo 1-3 Boxset is still worth it.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This film truly defines the term \\"poetic justice.\\"  It is the most eloquent of the holocaust films by what it does NOT show, what it does NOT attempt to preach.  It is the most touching of all, and proves that children are truly innocent and that people could get get along the world over if not for the garbage adults pour into their heads.  We need more beauty, less garbage.  A truly wonderful film.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|If you've gotten a BluRay disc player and surround sound, you've got a treat in store.  The opening sequence on the fleight deck of the Aircraft carrier is the real hook.  Once that F-16 blasts off, with Kenny Logging belting out \\"Danger Zone\\", the whole room will be vibrating.  You get my gist.  You'll love the BluRay edition of this movie.  It's one of my favorites

This is one of the most well known, well written, well portrayed, significant, revolutionary, important, mind bending comic book novels of all time.  This graphic novel should be known by everyone.  It changed modern comic books.  It influenced the styles of many of the great writers today.  It put a new spin on \\"super heroes\\".  It literally changed the way everyone viewed the way in which we could perceive the super powered world.  Great great book you should not only read, but own.

B000059TFO|5.0|I have loved this film for a long time, and have watched it repeatedly. It provides a valuable lesson on the civil rights era which I have shown to students who have no idea of what the 60s were like when the civil rights wars were being fought. The cast is excellent, and this film remains a poignantly dignified tribute to those who died fighting to put an end to primitive and savage racism.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|One of the best ways to ensure this show's survival to a third season is to buy this DVD.  Buying DVD sets saved Family Guy, led to a movie the movie Serenity, and much more.  Hopefully it can do the same for this amazing show!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen. For those of you who know nothing about history and are fans of this wretched piece of garbage, I must give you this breaking news--the Japanese did not bomb Pearl Harbor to break up a love triangle!     I would say that this movie has all the insight and intelligence of an ABC After School Special, but that would be an insult to children's television. If you want to watch a good movie about World War II, don't waste your money on this piece of crap. Buy Saving Private Ryan, Letters From Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers, The Thin Red Line, or Das Boot instead.
1416955070|3.0|Please do not read if you do not want the book spoiled!<br /><br />I would have rated City of Bones with 3 ½ stars if I could.  I did enjoy the book and stood awake till the early morning hours finishing it, but what kept me going was the banter between Clary and Jace.  The dialogue was a mixture of sarcasm, which I like, but when the author began to give Clary a description of the demons or other supernatural creatures, it felt like something was missing. In the beginning Clary is a mundane, and knows nothing of the supernatural world that she belongs to.  So when the characters are described to her it just seems chopped, leaving the reader a bit confused especially as different creatures are popping up all over. And it also seemed as if Clary wasn't really all that worried about her mother who was MIA.  Plus I kept wondering what the other characters would've been doing when Jace and Clary simply vanished.  There were definitely a lot of inconsistencies, but overlooking that the budding romance interlaced with action and intrigue was great!  I couldn't figure out how the author was going to write the love triangle between Jace, Clary, and Alec either. For the record, Alec is not in love with Clary, but with Jace, and Clary and Jace are having their own \\"moments.\\" Again...I loved Jace's character, and adding Clary to the mix provided good entertainment...but when they realize they are brother and sister is when the fun went out of it for me.  That just plain sucked.  Completely ruined the ending for me so I'm hoping in the next book that perhaps it was a mistake and they aren't really related.  Well...at least I can hope...

B001BPJJ82|4.0|A unique film, I liked it. I was disappointed to see that it didn't make it to the cinema... I loved the film... felt slightly rushed towards the end... but the story allows for such events.    The blu ray looks fantastic, well worth the slight extra for the fantastic visuals!    A few good extras that give you insight into the movies creation... but I would have loved to have seen more behind the scenes footage, but still i enjoyed the commentary
B00000JXVK|5.0|Even though filmed more than 30yrs ago , this is without a doubt, the best motorcycle movie ever made!  Even if you don't own or ride a motorcycle, you will enjoy this movie. It will make you laugh, it will make you cringe, and it will keep you entertained every second.    Just make sure you have this, the original Bruce Brown version - the remake (On Any Sunday II) is a cheap ripoff and sucks.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Despite the well-taken concerns about the inferior English subtitles on the DVD edition, my admiration and love for this film remain undiminished, and in fact grow with each viewing. It's a masterpiece of haunting visuals, miraculous light and color, taut framing, superb music, astonishing acting from its juvenile performers, and a story that combines savagery, comedy, agony, and tenderness in endlessly amazing ways. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a film of two genres, and it stretches both of them; neither the vampire film nor the pain-of-adolescence film will ever be the same again.
B001YB29HG|5.0|This is the same DVD version of the original disc that was released as a special to Amazon disc.  This edition features slightly altered packaging and will be more widely available.  If you have the original DVD, this one will have nothing that you don't already have.  If you don't have the original, you should feel comfortable getting this edition.<br /><br />DR. HORRIBLE is easily the most celebrated creation directly for the Internet. GEMINI DIVISION has come out since DR. HORRIBLE and is getting some good reviews in some quarters, but it has garnered nothing like the praise. Repeatedly over the years, Joss Whedon has managed to match or exceed expectations. No wonder that he managed to do so again with this gem. And it easily stands as the most remarkable thing that Neil Patrick Harris has done.<br /><br />It is nothing short of amazing how much on the cutting edge that either Whedon or his creations have been over the past 15 years. He helped write the screenplay for the first computer animated film, TOY STORY. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER alone was an epic of \\"firsts.\\" Buffy Summers was close to the first powerful female hero to be found on TV. Xena beat her by a couple of years (though not if you count the BUFFY movie), but Xena seems to have influenced few if any subsequent female heroes, while Buffy seems to inform them all. BUFFY pretty much invented the TV concept of the Body Count, whereby important and notable characters are killed off, completely upturning the prior convention that no recurring characters on a show were to meet untimely deaths). BUFFY was the first series to successfully employ the long narrative arc, building entire seasons around a single story. BUFFY was also the first series to be heavily downloaded on the Internet. This took place because of the decision of the WB to pull two episodes off the schedule after the Columbine High School shootings. The episodes were broadcast in Canada, where some fans made copies of them and uploaded them to the Internet. As a result, \\"Earshot\\" and \\"Graduation, Part 2\\" became the first heavily downloaded episodes in the history of television. Also, while BUFFY was not the first series to have a musical episode, \\"Once More With Feeling\\" was unquestionably the most successful. And while other series came out on DVD prior to BUFFY, it was one of the series to find the pricing \\"sweet spot\\" of around $40. Prior series like the STAR TREK and X-FILES franchises had been priced to high to generate big sales.<br /><br />Similarly, FIREFLY anticipated many of the alterations to Sci-fi that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA would wrought. No aliens, low tech, no magic science, hand held cameras, use of zoom on both regular cameras and on CGI \\"cameras\\" would all be reemployed on BSG.<br /><br />And BUFFY also became the first TV series to be continued in comic form (ANGEL would follow shortly). Many, many series have continued in noncanonical form, but this was the first series to continue in canonic fashion, with the creator at the helm. Since the advent of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER Season 8 on Darkhorse comics several other TV creators have contemplated continuing their shows as a comic, including Rob Thomas (VERONIC MARS) and Bryan Fuller (the tragically cancelled PUSHING DAISIES).<br /><br />In other words, it is hardly surprising that Joss Whedon, who has been out in front on so many other projects, would be out in front on exploring just what you could do on the Internet.<br /><br />That this is good is hardly a surprise given the astonishing quality of \\"Once More With Feeling,\\" the great musical episode from BUFFY Season 6. This has a far smaller cast, but what there is is outstanding. As I said above, Neil Patrick Harris has never been this good before (and he has on several occasions expressed interest in a sequel, to which I reply, \\"Bring it on!\\"). He sings in a wonderfully unaffected light tenor and manages to express all the nuances of his character. As a blogger who aspires to join the Evil League of Evil (led by Bad Horse -- at the end of the musical we discover that Bad Horse is, indeed, a horse), Harris couldn't be better. Felicia Day, who played one of the potentials in BUFFY Season 7, was unexpectedly delightful as Horrible's love interest Penny. And the always magnificent Nathan Fillion is wonderful in the project's third major character and Horrible's nemesis Captain Hammer. There are also some great cameos by writers who have gone on to other television series, but who made their mark as writers on BUFFY, including David Fury (now a major contributor to 24) and Marti Noxon (now show runner of PRIVATE PRACTICE, formerly show runner of BUFFY in Seasons 6 and 7) as newscasters, and Drew Goddard (currently a writer on LOST, recently the writer of CLOVERFIELD, and director and co-writer with Joss Whedon of the forthcoming film THE CABIN IN THE WOODS) as \\"Fake Thomas Jefferson\\" of the Evil League of Evil.<br /><br />As befitting a Joss Whedon creation, this does not end as you think it will. Some object to that. I celebrate it. The ending had far more of an emotional impact on me than I anticipated. Joss Whedon has stated that as a writer it is his job not to always give his viewers what they think they want, but what they actually need. That applies here.<br /><br />All in all, this is another amazing chapter is a long line of amazing creations by Joss Whedon, wonderfully performed and executed by some great performers.  Whedon has recently signed up with a software company to provide additional direct-to-Internet (and hopefully later to DVD) content along the lines of DR. HORRIBLE.  There has been whispering that there will be a new DR. HORRIBLE story before too long according to Nathan Fillion.  Neil Patrick Harris has expressed interest in doing a sequel.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Many people are aware that this album was made as part of the attempt to repair Leonard Cohen's seriously damaged finances.  After living in a Buddhist monastery for several years Cohen discovered that his business manager had embezzled most of his money.  Cohen reluctantly went back on the road over a decade after he imagined that he had left his musical career behind him.  One might therefore not be surprised if there were some signs of reluctance or regret hanging about this performance.  There is not.  In fact, this is one of the most delightful live performances I've heard in a while.  Perhaps it is the result of his time in the monastery, but Cohen seems genuinely at ease and happy performing.  Maybe it is like the old saying that if life gives you lemons, make lemonade.  From beginning to end Cohen gives the impression that there is nowhere he would rather be than before these friends in London and that performing for them is one of the greatest honors that has come his way.  So far from despair or regret, the concert radiates a sense of joy.<br /><br />Cohen's sense of humor and deep graciousness permeates every number.  The spoken intros to his songs and the verbal asides are among the highlights of the album.  Not that the music isn't exceptionally fine.  Although 73 at the time of the performance, Cohen is in very fine voice.  His voice has deepened greatly over the years.  If you listen to THE SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN, released in 1968, and then to this recording, the change in his voice is almost shocking.  He is backed by a large and crack group of players.  As always he has a talented group of women backing him, in this case his sometimes writing partner Sharon Robinson and the Webb Sisters.<br /><br />The paradox with Leonard Cohen is that while he has not been a very prolific songwriter, he has produced as many as truly great songs over the past forty years as anyone this side of Bob Dylan.  I usually recommend to friend interested in Cohen getting his first album, THE SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN, and the flawed but still excellent THE ESSENTIAL LEONARD COHEN (flawed because too much emphasis is placed on Cohen's later career, to the neglect of his early songs).  And most of his albums, even the very good ones, have several weak songs.  This live album is actually an excellent place for someone coming to Cohen for the first time to experience his music, though like with THE ESSENTIAL, his earlier songs are neglected for his later.<br /><br />Any live concert is going to leave aside some of any Cohen fan's favorites, and I'm no exception.  I regretted the absence of \\"The Stranger Song\\" and the extraordinary \\"Famous Blue Raincoat,\\" not to mention some personal favorites like \\"Joan of Arc.\\"  But unfortunately there is no single album that collects all of Cohen's best songs.  We very much need a three-CD box set that does this (there was a foreign box set that came close, but it is no longer available).<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the most delightful albums that I have listened to in a long time and I enthusiastically recommend it to both longtime fans of Leonard Cohen as well as newcomers who would like to get to know better the music of one of the finest songwriters of our time.HE SONGS OF LEONARD COHEN, and the flawed but still excellent THE ESSENTIAL LEONARD COHEN (flawed because too much emphasis is placed on Cohen's later career, to the neglect of his early songs).

I regretted the absence of \\"The Stranger Song\\" and the extraordinary \\"Famous Blue Raincoat,\\" not to mention some personal favorites like \\"Joan of Arc.\\"  But unfortunately there is no single album that collects all of Cohen's best songs.  We very much need a three-CD box set that does this (there was a foreign box set that came close, but it is no longer available).    All in all, this is one of the most delightful albums that I have listened to in a long time and I enthusiastically recommend it to both longtime fans of Leonard Cohen as well as newcomers who would like to get to know better the music of one of the finest songwriters of our time.

0451528956|4.0|I am currently engaged in a long-term and pretty in depth project that involves me reading all of the major fictional works on robots, Cyborgs, and other artificially created human life forms.  DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE belongs in this group even if it is an odd fit.  Hyde is definitely an artificial creation, due to the chemical and medical experiments of Dr. Jekyll.  And Jekyll is definitely one in a long line of insane (morally, if not psychologically) scientists who attempt to play god.  Along with FRANKENSTEIN it provides the template for the isolated made geniuses that populate so much subsequent Sci-fi from Wells's THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU and THE INVISIBLE MAN to Crichton's JURASSAIC PARK.  The historical importance of the book can hardly be overstressed.<br /><br />Yet, for a classic of its magnitude, it makes curiously unentertaining reading.  Victorian English literature is perhaps my favorite period in the history of literature.  I've read most of Dickens, nearly thirty novels by Anthony Trollope (one of my favorite authors), George Eliot's major works (and several minor), and a long string of early and late Victorian writers from Thackeray to Hardy to Butler to Wilde to Gissing, to Collins.  I even enjoy lesser writers like George Meredith and genre writers like Arthur Conan Doyle (who edges more into the Edwardian period for the bulk of his career).  And I absolutely adore Lewis Carroll.  Moving a bit further into literary history I have read all of H. G. Wells's major Sci-fi works and found something to enjoy in all of them.  But Stevenson's DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE I found curiously uninteresting.  The problem, in part, is that the book is structured to provide a shock, namely, that Jekyll and Hyde are the same person, only embodying different aspects of the same moral character.  I first read JEKYLL AND HYDE when I was in high school and did not enjoy it then, either.  I thought rereading it as a more mature reader might make a difference, but it did not.  The central idea of two people sharing the same body is brilliant and justly famous (is there anyone in our culture who doesn't know Jekyll and Hyde's joint secret?), but once you know that secret, the naivet&eacute; of Jekyll's friends in striving to understand the mystery of Hyde and his power over Jekyll is a tad tedious.<br /><br />The one thing that I did learn (or I supposed more properly, relearned) was that Hyde was a shrunken thing of a man.  My most recent encounters with Hyde have been in Alan Moore's brilliant graphic stories in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, in which Jekyll and especially Hyde is vividly and brilliantly drawn.  But in Moore's version, Hyde is a huge, hulking monster, akin to a Mighty Joe Young, capable of ripping men apart limb by limb.  Stevenson's Hyde, on the contrary, is a diminutive, skulking thing.  With Darwin's theories prevalent, we are clearly to perceive Hyde as a devolution of a human soul, a step backwards in primitiveness.<br /><br />I would love to have been one of the first readers of the story.  I would love to know precisely how this story appeared to people when the concept was fresh and unknown.  The story as it currently exists is hurt by its own success.  It remains must reading for anyone concerned about the history of Sci-fi and the quirky edges of Victorian literature.  But I wonder if it still has the capacity to entertain like so many other books.  I've read Wilkie Collins's THE WOMAN IN WHITE three times and fully expect to read it again at some point.

B001PA0FFO|4.0|If you do NOT like advertisements in your DVDs then you will NOT want to buy this DVD.    For the film it's self, Meryl SHOULD have won the Oscar for this 1 instead of that person where their career is being s stripper & taking their clothes off in nearly every movie they do.    The entire cast was good in their roles, Philip as the Father, Amy as the young nun.  Now, Viola Davis's role was SO SMALL.  And, her character was walking asleep & did NOT care about her child.  Surprised she got an Oscar nomination for such a small role.    Now, the DVD package--we step in to the old days of DVD's with a plain silver disc.  BORING.    Now, the ads I mentioned before.  NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST in the package, all you get are 2 ads.  When you input the disc it wants to show you coming attraction (ads).  When you start to play the movie, ANOTHER AD.  Nice way to miss it skip to the next chapter to ACTUALLY GET TO THE MOVIE OR WHAT YOU PAID FOR.

B001SN78JO|2.0|Im not sure when it became apparent that Hollywood began confusing funny with cutesy but it seems to be what they do best these days and Yes Man is no different.    What started out promisingly enough, in the tradition of Liar Liar, soon petered out to be something more annoying than actually funny. Sometimes a good romantic comedy is a welcome deviation from the gloom and doom laden flicks that are the norm these days.     How about actually making one funny though instead of cute and sappy. Cute just isnt funny, just ask M. Mcconaghey (sp.), he wouldnt know funny if it hit him like a truck.     If you actually prefer real funny over just cute then stick with \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" or the raunchier \\"Me, myself and Irene\\".    \\"Yes Man\\" goes for a few chuckles at best, very few.

If you love the softly swaying intoxicating beat of Bossa Nova, this sounds like dancing in a pool of maple syrup. I love Krall the jazz singer; I had patience with some of her previous string accompanied pieces, but this has strayed too far.  On this album, she is emulating the no talent wispy voiced female vocalists thaat fill the airwaves.    Please Diana come back to the wonderful jazz vocals you do!  I give her 2 stars only because there is far worse out there, but for her, this is a 1 star album.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Few film's achieve perfection and \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" is in that rarified class.  Ostensibly this is an adventure story but at it's core it is an allegory of desperation and greed.  The thing that puts chills in my spine is that Fred C. Dobbs, masterfully played by Humphrey Bogart who in my mind gives his finest performance, is not an exception in what the potential of new-gotten gains can do to the unsuspecting heart.  Walter Huston deservedly won the Oscar for his portrayal of Howard, the wizened prospector who warns his co-horts of the hazards of gold fever.  Huston was a great actor and it would behoove anyone to check out his work in \\"Dodsworth\\", in my mind the greatest American film of the 1930's.  Tim Holt cannot be overlooked for his portrayal of Curtin, the young drifter torn between the sage advise of Howard and the avarice of Dobbs.  I consider this to be the finest film that Bogart appeared in and when you consider his canon of work that's high praise.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's always ironic when the very values of a television show highlight some of the worst aspects of the shows own network, in this case FOX. Deciding to cancel this excellent, imaginative, well acted, intelligent, and decidedly awesome series smacks of the worst sort of incompetence at best, and heavy-handed draconian intolerance that The Alliance themselves would be proud of.<br /><br />What sets this show apart from virtually everything else currently on television is it's ability to create a powerful nostalgia for a time when living--and sometimes dying--free was an attainable reality. A sci-fi drama that aptly captures that quintessential Americanism: 'Give me liberty or give me death.'<br /><br />However, the show is not just a vehicle for advancing a political stance. It's epically entertaining. Even the movie that finalizes what the show's abrupt cancellation never allowed to develop, is lesser than the episodes that make up the first and last season of Serenity. Nathan Fillion is perfectly cast as the Serenity's captain, and gives the show the gravitas that only talented actor can.<br /><br />This one goes down in the record books as one of the stupidest cancellations in the history of TV. Very sad indeed, but as many others have said in their own reviews, 'The can't take the sky from me.'
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I would have to say that \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" are probably the two greatest matinee movies of all-time.  And I would have to say that Spielberg took his cues from this film.  The film contains swashbuckling action, good-hearted comedy, and romance that is hard to resist.  Errol Flynn projects palpable charisma and makes you believe that he was born to wear Robin Hood's tights.  He's abetted by Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone who give deliciously nefarious accounts as Prince John and Sir Guy.  Need we forget that the movie is an indelible metaphor for the facism that existed in Europe at the time.  Hah!  If you believe that I have a bridge in London to sell you.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|after seeing this film, i was at a loss to figure out why so many people were dead set against it's receiving a little glory at the expense of shutting out 'the dark knight'.  many people kept referring to it as the 'token holocaust film'. to me, this film had little to do with the holocaust--outside of one plot point that i won't divulge.<br /><br />in fact, i'm leaving the plot alone and concentrating on the things i loved the most. the first thing, of course, is kate winslet's subtle, yet emotionally rending work as hanna, the cable car worker that finds herself in an affair with a 15-year old boy. winslet plays this woman over a 30-year span of life and she is nothing short of brilliant.  her final scene with ralph fiennes is filled with so much passion that just to remember it gives me goose flesh.<br /><br />fiennes is more than capable as the lawyer that was hanna's lover; but david kross as the young michael is a standout performance from a young actor. he covers a great deal of emotional terrain in this role and he matches winslet scene for scene. and many of the scenes they play are very difficult, extremely intimate and all are extremely powerful.  i wonder if he had been a shade older, could he have played michael through the film?<br /><br />the film's second surprise (the first isn't that much of a surprise, really) is lena olin as the concentration camp survivor.  she too is wonderful and show great range for she plays the woman's daughter at the very end of the film.<br /><br />there is loads of beautiful yet understated period detail in the first two thirds of the film; once it gets to the late 1980s, it gets a afraid of being honest.  that's a pity.  but it's a tiny pity. this film is to be appreciated many times over for winslet's brave portrayal of one of the most complex women in a film since blanchett and dench starred in 'notes on a scandal'.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Saw this movie many years ago and decided it needed to join my collection. Despite the assless chaps and flagrant homo-erotcism it is still a fun to watch movie with lots of action. Its a snapshot of a different time and place in movie making a glance back in time as represented in the style of clothes the characters wear. A story of a cop pushed over the edge to vigilante vengeance, with the death of his partner and young wife and child. Set in a somewhat post apocalyptic time where law and order is a slippery concept at best. Sets the scene for a great series of movies.

B001FVK1SY|2.0|Being both heavily into [[ASIN:B0002Y69NG The Matrix Trilogy]] and the original [[ASIN:B00008IHAV Speed Racer cartoon]] of the late 60s, I went into this re-imagining with high hopes. I figured surely the Wachowski brothers could do it justice if anyone could.<br /><br />I had to think back to my childhood and remember if the cartoon was really that good, and I must say that, in its day, it was. It was also probably the first anime I'd ever seen, and I enjoyed the style immensely. But one has to wonder if that style would translate well to a feature film in today's market.<br /><br />Although there must certainly be fans of this film out-and-about, you won't find one here. Why? you might ask. For me, it was the complete lack of a coherent story flow. Anime isn't necessarily known for this anyway, which was why I questioned Speed Racer being made into a movie in the first place. I think the Hollywood big-wigs must've thought that they could tug the memory-strings of those who'd grown up with the cartoon series and get them to plop down hard-earned cash at the box office. Not to mention attaching big name directors and stars to it. Undoubtedly the film did well because of these aforementioned items. But if you're looking for anything approaching substance, you won't find it here.<br /><br />The film is a zig-zagging, nonstop, car race (for the most part) that leaves no time for the audiences eyes to rest. This created a sort of disorientation for me, in that I felt I was being pushed (or dragged) along throughout the entire film. It was like the film makers didn't want you to rest and think about ...anything. \\"Just enjoy the cool cars, the excess colors, and all this action,\\" is what they seemed to be saying. Although Emile Hirsch ([[ASIN:B001FB55KI Milk]]) did an okay job with what he was given, I simply didn't care about him or his family in any way, shape or form because I never got to know them (we were always \\"racing\\" from one car race to the next).<br /><br />That said, I did discover some things that worried me as a kid:<br /><br />1. Pops Racer hasn't died of high blood pressure. He's got his temper semi-under control.<br />2. Sparky is gay. For sure. Did you see the way he looked at Speedy's butt?<br />3. Mom Racer needs to get laid. Desperately. She's too wound up.<br />4.Racer X. Is he Speedy's long, lost brother. Well ...you'll have to watch and find out.<br /><br />I have to wonder if kids who can't sit through stories that develop good characters wouldn't enjoy this flick. It moves so fast that I don't think it'd give them time to care. Which might be why Speed Racer did better than I thought it would at the cinema...hings that worried me as a kid:    1.

B001TOD92C|5.0|You can't help but wonder at the autobiographical aspects of The Wrestler - for all his spandex and the lank blonde hair and the self-mutilation, at a very visceral level Mickey Rourke isn't entirely acting this. I have read some comments that this is a film full of cliches redeemed by Rourke's performance but (whilst not taking anything away from Rourke's outstanding performance) that's harsh. For here is a tragedy: Randy the Ram is, at an almost biological level, a performer: it is only as a performer that his life has any value even to him, let alone anyone else, and he is only ever in his element - the sparkle returns - when he is \\"performing\\". Thereby performance becomes a means of communication outside the ring, too: rough-housing with kids outside the van he's been sleeping in, delivering egg salad, Cocktail-style, to elderly ladies over the deli counter at the local supermarket or carousing with the wrestlers, who still lionise him, backstage. Aronofsky's camera reinforces this point - we track behind Randy's head not only as he strides out to the ring, but as he marches out to the deli counter and marches in to meet the gang backstage.<br /><br />That performs as a way of living is fascinatingly counterpointed by his only (half-way successful) real life relationship, with Cassidy, a stripper, in many ways a very similar sort of a performer (we frequently also track behind Cassidy's head) but dispositionally the negative image: for Cassidy is *condemned* to perform to live (i.e. to earn a crust), and for her, performance is the only part of her life that has no meaning, and is the part she is most desperate to leave behind.<br /><br />That Randy has the misfortune not to apprehend this drives the drama in The Wrestler. Cassidy and Randy are star-cross'd lovers:  the two connect only when he's not performing and (QED, since he's a customer) she is. Like oil and water Cassidy feels forced to keep him segregated from her real self, within the context of her life as a performer; he wants her only outside of his. That is the tragic dilemma around which this film revolves, and while it may be constructed out of hackneyed archetypes it overcomes them handsomely.<br /><br />Olly Buxtoner; he wants her only outside of his.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|A fantastic series. Very poignant and shows you the personalities of our Founding Fathers, explores their strengths and weaknesses, and shows Adams as a man and a great American.

B001P5HI4A|5.0|When I saw this movie in 1983 it touched my soul and never let go.  25 years later I still remembered the story and some of the music, and I have watched for years for its DVD release.  Elated to finally see it, I didn't hesitate to pay the 19.99 price.<br /><br />This release is a special  2-disc Director's Extended Edition, with cut and uncut versions of the movie, plus a few special features, none of which are very special, other than Steisand's introductions.  So a single DVD would have been just as good for me, but I'm just happy to have it, in whatever form!<br /><br />This movie is Steisand at her best, as director, co-writer, singer, and star.  It's a timeless story of a woman who yearns to study, but who lives in a culture that says study is only for men.  She disguises herself as a man in order to get that education.  A story of a strong woman who breaks the gender roles of her time, and a tangled love story.<br /><br />Personally the marriage part of the story I find disturbing, as inconsistent with the judgment such a woman would likely have.  Nonetheless, this film ranks high in my all-time favorites, and I highly recommend it!

B000002KAT|4.0|Bach's music has been around for several centuries, so 40 years is but a quick blink in the realm of intelligent design or whatever you want to call your own transcendental private Idaho. Van Morrison's \\"Astral Weeks\\" seems to be standing the test of time, however. I woke up one recent morning to an NPR feature on Morrison and the 40-year anniversary of \\"Astral Weeks\\" and Morrison was singing \\"... to be born again... in another time, in another place...\\" The singer's rather high-pitched plaintive refrain caught me by surprise and it was like I was hearing the song for the first time. It seemed like a call from some higher plane of existence, or maybe it was just wishful thinking in light of the ground shifting underneath our collective feet these days. Yes indeed, to be born again. I can't buy much but I'll buy that! And if I can't be born again than I'll get \\"Astral Weeks\\" instead. And so I did. It struck me that Morrison seems like an old Bard all dressed up in new clothing which he wears effortlessly, engagingly, and with feeling. He is, after all, a new-age sensitive guy, is he not?     The real highlight of the album is the beautiful and strange \\"Madam George\\". It's enigmatic and haunting and more in the realm of a bard-like, oral-tradition narrative than any piece of forgettable folk-rock lyrics. On the album as a whole, and particularly on \\"Madam George\\", it's as if Morrison is improvising his way through melody and meaning; the more he sings, the more he commits himself to the truth of his materials, even though the truth can be heartbreaking. 1968: A convulsive, seminal state space every which way you turned, and even now, every where you go, there you are: 1968. \\"Astral weeks\\" may be a bit thin, but all the better to see through to the other side of one's personal destiny.

B001TODCII|5.0|Released overseas about half a year ago and widely acclaimed, Taken is the new action flick written by Luc Bession, who did the very famous Leon: The Professional. If you were satisfied with the pure straight Balls To The Wall action style that Leon offered, look no further than Taken, with Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace! Taken is an action movie that just is pure energy and action from beginning to end.<br /><br />In \\"Taken\\", Liam Neeson plays Bryan, an ex-CIA agent who is divorced from his wife, yet still sees his Daughter on a regular basis. His latest thing he's done is protect a repressed pop singer from a violent riot that happens after a concert of hers. Later, he learns that his daughter wants to go to Europe with her friend, and he very reluctantly lets her. Within the very first hour of their arrival in Paris, they are both captured by two people, and Bryan, being the overprotective flake he is, learns that these two people addict the girls they capture to drugs, and eventually, within 96 hours, they become prostitutes in the European Sex Slave Trade. Bryan travels to Paris to save her. He has 96 hours to find her and get her to safety or it's too late!<br /><br />More effective than an energy drink, this movie wastes no time and just gets straight to the point right away. There's lots of great action, and the finale on the boat is a total \\"WHOA\\" moment. The only problem I had with this film is that even though I loved it, I had the feeling as if I had seen it before somewhere. Usually, with these types of action films, you've seen one, you've seen it all.<br /><br />But overall this is a great, fist-clenching action thriller, very well made and a great way to spend 90 minutes. Don't miss this movie, because you will be \\"taken\\" in by its action!
B001HN69AE|3.0|as far as following the plot of dragonball and dragonball z. it didn't come close. however it was a lot of fun to watch. on the side of the wrighters. there is no way that they could have fit everything that the anime had in the movie. and still have been able to make a profit. i mean think people would you have wanted a movie that it took over a $1,000,000,000 to make. that is about what it would have cost to make the hardcore fans happy. it would have also been close to six hours long. they had to start with just the elements of dragonball to make it and they still went over $1,000,000. it had some of the best effects I have seen in a long time. The fighting could have been better. but at least the acting was not stale. It is  a good movie and the next one (Fox has already started making it) will be about the same.

B000002LE6|1.0|If this album sold any copies, it must be because of the cover (nude). The follow-up to the best album Prince has ever recorded, SIGN \\"O\\" THE TIMES, is the worst album Prince has ever recorded. Well, one of the worst, if not thee worst.<br /><br />Prince was set to release another double-disc epic but I guess Warner Bros. wouldn't allow it so LOVESEXY was released on Warners and THE BLACK ALBUM was released as a bootleg. The better of the two: THE BLACK ALBUM. Reasoning: Funky tracks. Although \\"When 2 R In Love\\" appears on both albums, (LOVESEXY 9 selections to THE BLACK ALBUM's 8) LOVESEXY just does not shine in a partly cloudy sky. \\"Alphabet Street\\", \\"Anna Stesia\\" and \\"I Wish U Heaven\\" are the only worthwhile selections here and speaking of selections, it was a really stupid move between Prince and Warners to release 9 selections as just 1 selction for the entire album, how annoying is that?<br /><br />What else can I say here? Nothing good. I am a die-hard Prince fans so to all you Prince fans out there who enjoyed LOVESEXY, I don't know. Maybe there's too much wax in my ears to hear what you all have heard.
B00003CXB4|5.0|We were delighted with this DVD of \\"The Lion King.\\"  We received it in short order and it was perfect...not one that was that was imported, one that played and paused, played and paused.  We are grateful to have found this seller. I wanted our grandson to know the characters before we took him to the broadway production in Oklahoma City.  He loves it and has watched it repeatedly.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you're a fan of Joss Whedon, or sci-fi, or geeky good times, then get this. Watch it. More than once. It gets funnier every time. If you can't stand musicals, however, this may not be for you. The Whedon brothers may have intended this to be very tongue-in-cheek, but their musical talents are actually quite impressive and Neil Patrick Harris is just brilliant.
B00008973A|5.0|I teach an Introduction to Theatre and a Drama skills class. I purchased this movie to show some of my 'star-struck' students a little bit of reality: from the 'cattle-call' auditions to the 'tell me about the real you' to the final 'you all are very special' cut.   It does bring home the point that NYC is FULL of talented 'I really need this job!' triple threat people (acting, singing, dancing). And it all comes down to that 'something' that makes the director see you as that character.  For a classroom intrduction to the world of Broadway musicals, this movie Works!  I also show only the 'cattle-call' scene from 'All that Jazz' to underscore the message.

B000A2IPP0|5.0|E.T. - The Extra - Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)          I had a Big thought on the Type of Alien that E.T. represents in this Movie finally?  He's a Frog Alien!  There is a Connection in the Film to the Scene where Elliot is in Science Middle-school Class, and He is about to be asked to discect the Frog!          The Classmates Administer the Sleeping Chemical to the Jar, and prepare!   And, Elliot draws the Connection, and Calls to his Classmates to free the Frogs back to Nature, and their Ecological Freedom!    Are Frog Aliens a California Alien Conspiracy in the 1980's?           Really, it seems that the Alien is only interested in the Botanical Ecology of America, and Earth in the Movie!   So, I think the Filmmakers thought that this Idea for a Creature Space Alien would fit a Childhood Adventure!  That was back in 1983 when the Film was released, and captured the Hearts and Childhood Dreams of Filmgoers!           A kinda Sci-fi Alien, for a Special Effect Children's Movie.   The Aliens Ship is so perfect for a Childhood Fanatsy on an Alien and Boy!   It's like a Christmas Tree Orniment!  Really, Frog Aliens might come from some kinda Water Planet mostly!          So, watching the Movie on it's 2005 DVD release, is like a re-understanding with the Alien E.T. for Me!  That He is a Type of Frog Alien, that may be the only \\"Be Good\\" Alien of his Spiecies in the Film! But belongs to a Sci-fi Concept of Aliens that may reach out to even Alienography!  Even tough such Concepts might best be scene as Alien Life that has not reached Earth, but may be in Galaxy's Far, far away!    MSH, 4/13/09, 39, SC.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|This CD did not not have a GREAT song on it.  Not horrible just nothing I can listen too again and again.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|As an Australian expatriate and great fan of Baz Luhrman I was concerned by the many negative reviews of this film - and was happily surprised by it when I saw it for myself.  The fact that the \\"story\\" of this unabashedly epic film is narrated by a young Aboriginal boy (played most engagingly by Brandon Walters )is absolutely crucial to its understanding.  It is HIS story: his voice carries the epic, introduces the main characters, and draws the audience into a time of massive social upheaval evidenced by the many differing forms of interaction between non-indigenous (European and Japanese)and indigenous people. On one level Nicole Kidman's uptight Englishwoman (\\"Missus Boss\\") is a cultural caricature,and Hugh Jackman's drover is unbelievably tough, handsome, competent and  moral.  But, to the diminutive narrator they are heroes, and David Wenham and Bryan Brown are the bad guys.  Bound together by his voice with its sometimes comic turns of phrase, the film moves along as a sequence of episodes, with many memorable moments beautifully realised and deeply moving. It is very much classic Luhrman : his luxurious direction clothes his narrator's compelling story in just gorgeous images of Australia. I would recommend this film to anyone wanting to understand what makes Australia and Australians tick.
B00028HBKM|5.0|So I very highly that this one review in 2,031 current reviews will even be read.  But hey, I just wanted to put in my own little review.  I'm 16, I'm an American girl raised in an evangelical Christian home.  So obviously my review of this film will be five stars.  I just want to say to the Christians out there, this film is perfect for a visual of what Jesus really went through (physically and spiritually) for us ALL.  I believe that it is a wonderful thing for all Christians to see the pain and suffering that He went through, but the love that He retained throughout the entire ordeal.<br />This movie is VERY GRAPHIC.  You see them hammering the nails into His hands.  Remember how they put a crown of thorns on His head?  Yeah, not put, PUSHED a crown of thorns INTO His head.  If teens can handle goriness, I think they will appreciate the film.  Don't ruin it for your kids, though, by making them watch what might turn into a horror film (for them).<br />And one last note--like my pastor pointed out, if YOU had been the only person on Earth, Jesus still would have done this all for YOU.
B000F3T7R4|3.0|Three and a half stars actually.     A truly blues/rock classic. If you call yourself a Whitesnake fan and don't own this shame on you!  This was the first Whitesnake album I ever heard, and quite by accident. I was 14 in 1987 and asked for Whitesnake for Christmas, well my aunt grabbed the first thing with Whitesnake printed on it, and this is what I got! Imagine my surprise.......I actually enjoyed it then and still do today.      While not as polished as the afore mentioned album, it has a certain grit to it, that you don't find on recordings anymore.     Take Me With You, Love to Keep You Warm, The Time is right for Love, Trouble and Don't Mess With Me  are the strongest tracks.  I even like their version of Day Tripper.      Before purchasing this just ask yourself, \\"do I like 70's blues rock?\\"........\\"do I like David Coverdale's singing?\\"  If the answer is yes this is a no brainer.

B000XZBN76|3.0|Three and a half stars for Scorpions second album!  And just so you know four stars is damn near perfect and five stars is an Enigma.  I really liked this one.  The opening track (Speedy's Comming) seems a little out of place as it's more of a straight on rocker than the others. They need a Million features Rudolph Schenker on vocals for the first and only time in Scorpions long history.  Drifting Sun features Uli Jon Roth on Vocals and it is a seven and a half minute journey you will not forget, seriously, give it a good headphones listen at threshold of pain volume and you'll see what I mean.       The good thing about this album is, you don't need to be a Scorpions fan to enjoy it. It's also relatively short, so by the time it ends you're like \\"what just happend?\\"..............and you'll play it again.    Now, if you're one of those people who needs your music spoon fed to you (you KNOW who you are) just don't do it............Everyone else Fly To The Rainbow........yes, that's an order.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|I have been watching Little Dorrit on PBS and am thoroughly enjoying it...Matthew Macfadyen and Claire Foy are perfectly cast. Was it just me or was any one else moved when Amy Dorrit tells Maggy the story of the princess and the little woman in the cottage who keeps watch over a beloved shadow (as a metaphor for her secret love for Arthur Clennam?) This is a beautifully moving scene...her watching Arthur from the window while she tells Maggy the story. I can't wait to read this book!
B00127RAJY|4.0|You sweat to this workout! It takes a lot of effort but it is worth it, I am already starting to see definition in my muscles after 2 1/2 weeks. The only thing about this DVD is that you are not sure when to move on from level 1 to level 2 and so forth so I have been doing it at my own pace when I felt ready I moved on to level 2. If you are a beginner stick to the level 1 until you are actually ready. Other than that great product!
B001R7IHA0|4.0|After the dreary 'Love, pain, & the Whole Crazy Thing', Keith Urban is back to recording the kind of music his fans love.    While this cd is still no 'Be Here' or 'Golden Road', it is a step in the right direction. No more 6-plus minute songs that go on and on. No more dreary, depressing songs.    'Kiss a Girl' and 'Sweet Thing' are def the best songs on here, so I'm glad he chose to release them as singles. The other songs are great as well. And the final song, 'thank you' is so personal, you feel like you're eavesdropping on a private moment between Keith and his wife.    Glad to see KU is heading in the right direction.
B000056NX5|5.0|I have read so many reviews saying that this version sucked and that this version cannot hold a candle to anything. I cannot disagree more this version has great singers ranging in thier styles and ranges that go together perfectly! jerome pradon as an example is a wonderful singer using his voice to tell a story it was because of his rock like lisp that i listened more intently to the lyrics and began to sympathise with Judas which i had never done befor. This movie uses the long flowing look of jesus to copare to the punk ruggad judas and thier voices are as different as thier looks! as to people saying that this version sucked they are wrong. this version was filmed entirley indoors which makes the story so much easier to understand the simplicity is genius!!   so kudos to jerome pradon and he enitre cast for a superb version.
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|This album not only has lived up to my expectation but it's also blown them away. It's simple but with rich layers and sounds that you wonder if you've ever heard them before. The vocals are brilliant and the songs are mind bending. Pearls Dream is my favorite so far.
0312427999|5.0|I have the audio and I keep it in my car. This a must read (or listen).  I remember as a young man in Vietnam being told that we were there to stop the spread of communism and to spread democracy.  What I was being  told was not what I was seeing.  This country was embracing rightwing dictators and while claiming to hate commmiunist dictators. Then later I  learned that we had overthrown elected governments.    In college I started out majoring in economics and when I got into the  intermediate and advance courses, some of the [...] didn't make sense to  me.  I thought it was my inability to grasp concepts my doctor professor  was trying to teach me. Economics was suppose to be an empiracal science?  Based on the assumption that man is rational?  If Milton Freidman thinks  that if you let market work free without any interference from government,  then why does he think so-called rational men need to be bombarded with  slick ad campaigns and heavy indoctrinating students to accept his way of  thnking? Rational men should be manipulated, but markets should be unregulated? The stuff didn't make sense then, but now I know why!    All in all Ms Klein does a great job is exposing the Orwellian lies about  the virtues of Free Market Capitalism/Privatization and its ugly twin sister Free Trade Globalization. These are just euphemisms for Neo Feudalism/Fascism and Neo Colonialism/Imperialism.  The Freidmanistes' agenda is to dismantle the New Deal.
0810970686|3.0|These graphic novels by Kinney are so much fun to read. They're quick and easy, but help to remind us all about the perils of middle school and growing up.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|I was a bit surprised to see any negative reviews here, but I guess different people feel differently so I won't get into anything other than why I thought this movie was off the charts!<br /><br />First, like others, I'd heard all the hype, and just last night my wife brought it in and we watched it...<br /><br />I can honestly say for my part, with all the awards it got, I was thinking prior to seeing it, could it really be that good?<br /><br />Well now having seen it, I have to say it definitely is!  I thought the filming was exceptional and the scenery was incredible!  I've traveled a bit in my time on this floating sod of earth and I've always been amazed when in what are referred to as (Third World Countries), the people can have so little and still seem to be happy with life.  Well not all of them but this movie delves into the underside of humanity also and although repulsive and shocking to some, it unfortunately is a reality as well and very graphically depicted in this film.<br /><br />It jumps back and forth but it is very cleverly put together so that it all makes completely sense as it unfolds.  I don't want to say more and spoil it for those that haven't seen it, but if you have ever wanted to see another country or the country of India, if you can't get there, this is a film that will take you there!  And I thought the acting was superb!<br /><br />We rented the movie.<br /><br />I will definitely buy this movie having seen it now and I truly think it is one of the most amazing films, I've ever seen or that has ever been made!<br /><br />Hat's off to everyone who made this project come to life and it's deserving, (Again in my opinion) of all the praise and then some!<br /><br />Chase Von<br /><br />Author of<br /><br />Your Chance To Hear The Last Panther Speak
0439813786|5.0|This was surprisingly well done. I'm not sure what I was initially expecting, but the story far exceeded my expectations. The characters are interesting, and the graphic-novel style way of presenting the story is perfect for how it unfolds and the subject matter being used to move along the plot. Typically, I steer clear of saying things like, \\"this is the first of its kind\\" because that gets thrown around a lot as a marketing term. However, this is something of a first, especially as an award winner, and Selznick does a wonderful job of interlacing the pictures with the words in order to tell a complete story.<br /><br />Even beyond that though, the story itself is wonderful, despite the method through which it's told. The characters are all fascinating and mysterious in their own way, and everyone has secrets. Not to mention that each character's personality and foibles adds to the depth of the narrative. I recommend this to all readers, but it will come alive especially well for readers 8-12.<br /><br />-Lindsey Miller, [..]
B001PL4HZW|5.0|I was already familiar with the original Twilight soundtrack, and was intrigued by the additional five tracks this one contains.  A great addition to the mix:  one original song, one song performed live, and several acoustic or remixes.  Really worth it!!
B00011F5DK|4.0|Since this is review #400 something, I'll get to my point.  Most games, you can safely ignore the age range.  For example, Connect 4 says 7+, but my 4 year old loves it.  With connect 4, he doesnt have any real strategy yet, but gets trying to get 4 in a row.  Blokus isnt like that, dont ignore the lower age limit of 5.  My four year old just cant get Blokus at all, and its very very painful to watch.  We have tried several times, but it seems that the brain wiring for it isnt in yet.  My seven year old (who is ahead of her class in most ways) got how to move in her first game, and picked up some strategy in her second game.  I have my doubts that my son will be ready for it at 5, but maybe some 5 yr olds can get it.       If you want another strategy game that can be enjoyed by a child younger than 5, Connect 4, Othello and Pente are my top choices.  (Pente does have small and numerous pieces.)  Blokus, not so much.       UPDATE:  After trying several times, my son (4 1/2 now) has mostly managed to get how to move properly.  I still think 4 1/2 is too young, but he definitely seems to have learned something which is very cool...we could not seem to help him understand corner to corner placement...he would not get it...then after a few games, something clicked in his brain between games.

B001QWQJ4W|3.0|Five years after \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" sped its way across the silver screen, the third installment in the franchise, \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\", raced its way into theaters. After two successful entries into a series that most didn't expect much out of to begin with, can this third iteration featuring an all-new cast, style of racing, and country gain enough traction to build upon the success of its predecessors or will it leave the series simply spinning its tires?    \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\" explores the illegal world of underground street racing in and around Tokyo, Japan. Unlike in the states, the primary style of racing over there is a much more difficult, and outrageous form known as drifting - where drivers' skills are put to the test as they must navigate hairpin turns at incredible rates of speed. Joining the ranks of these racers is a convicted racer from the United States named Sean (Lucas Black) whose parents had hoped he would be able to start a new life in this foreign land. However, when racing is at the core of your very being, it's hard to walk away when the temptation of high speeds is calling out to you.    Even though I had seen the first two films in this series, I found myself with little to no interest in seeing this third one. The only reason I could come up with for this lack of confidence in the film, was because I thought the second one was a little weaker than the first, even though it at least featured one returning cast member (Paul Walker for those that don't recall) which garnered some favor; however for this film there appeared to be no original cast members returning from either of the previous films. So, in my opinion there didn't seem to be a whole lot of potential for \\"Tokyo Drift\\" to actually be all that good. Based on the box office results for this film, I felt that my estimation for the movie was fairly accurate, and I was pretty sure I wouldn't get around to watching it anytime soon, if everfor that matter. Then, there came along the recently released Blu-ray collection of the trilogy. Because I wanted to own the first two films on Blu-ray, and they were only available in a trilogy box set, I knew that I would end up with the third one anyhow. Which meant that since it was now in my possession, and I had already watched the other two, I may as well put this one into the player and see how it fares by comparison. Much to my surprise, \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\" is actually a pretty good movie. Granted it's not as good as the first film, and is perhaps a little below \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\"; the film still did an admirable job of keeping me entertained to varying degrees from beginning to end.    Written by newcomer to the series, Chris Morgan (\\"Wanted\\"), \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\", was a surprisingly well put together story, albeit with a few contrivances and convenient plot devices employed. I figured that if this series ever made it to a third movie it would most likely be tapped out in terms of story, unless they would be willing to resurrect some of the characters from the previous films and delve into them a bit more. However, I was wrong, because Chris Morgan wisely chose to shake things up dramatically to inject a new sense of life into a franchise that was running the risk of becoming stale in a hurry if the status quo remained intact. The inclusion of the new style of racing (which was incredibly fun to watch, especially for someone that hadn't really seen it done before), having not just a new city, but an all-new country as the backdrop for the action, and making it more of a fish out of water-esque story opened up several new doors for the series to walk through.    Even though the story brought new energy to the series there were some problems that plagued the script along the way. For starters, the character of Twink (played by Bow Wow) seems to have an endless supply of goods which he sells to whoever has the desiredamount of cash. This wouldn't be a trouble spot for me, except that Twink is merely a high school student, and by all accounts shouldn't have access to the amount of goods and services he has at his disposal. If the writer really wanted me to believe that Twink was capable of gaining access to all this stuff via stealing or whatever, then that is fine, but I believe that we should have seen this at some point within the story. Instead, his character came off as a little too unbelievable for my liking. Also, the whole plot point of sending Sean to Japan seemed like a big leap for me. Sure he's apparently gotten into a lot of trouble over in the U.S., but having his mom just give up and ship him over to his dad (who doesn't seem like he'll be all that good of an influence) seemed a little too convenient of a way to introduce us to the world of drifting. I know it was necessary to get the character over to Japan, but it could have been achieved within the story any number of ways, and most of them would have been more successful.    The last problem within the story that I will discuss revolves around the drifting style of racing that the movie focuses upon. I appreciated that a new style was introduced (as I mentioned a moment ago); however, there seemed to be numerous times that the characters opted to drift (unnecessarily) rather than drive straight (as in the previous two films). This was especially evident during a car chase sequence where all the drivers were drifting around traffic and other miscellaneous obstructions, when if they had simply moved over slightly they could've just driven straight (or relatively straight), thus gaining more speed to outrun their pursuers. It was due to these weaknesses within the story that caused several lapses in believability, resulting in a somewhat diminished opinion for the film.    Helming this third venture into the high-octane series is director Justin Lin (\\"Annapolis\\"). Lin brings a somewhat more grounded sense to thisfilm than what was showcased in the previous film under the direction of John Singleton. The majority of the action seemed to be done using real cars, with little CGI enhancement being employed. The second film used plenty of real cars as well, but numerous sequences displayed obvious CGI usage in place of the real deal. With \\"Tokyo Drift\\", director Justin Lin appeared to stretch himself a bit more as a director, getting away from the straight-forward, generic camera style he used in his previous American film \\"Annapolis\\". For a movie such as \\"Tokyo Drift\\" to really fit in with the rest of the series, it requires that a little more flair be brought to the camera work, and Lin came through surprisingly well. He offered up a slick piece of American cinema that fits in perfectly with the tone and feel of the previous two films, while establishing the movie as a standalone entity within the franchise.    The cast for this film was comprised of numerous young acting talents, some more capable than others at their craft, and based on most of the cast member's limited experience, I really didn't expect much out of them either. As you can see by now there were several factors that led to me viewing this film with rather low expectations. Anyways, leading the cast is actor Lucas Black (\\"Jarhead\\") who gives a decent, although flawed performance as Sean. With a slight southern drawl, that is inconsistent in thickness throughout his entire performance, and a few instances where Lucas portrayed a somewhat down home country charm when attempting to woo the ladies, there weren't too many layers or points of interest to be found in his character. Truth be told, Lucas was probably the weakest cast member performance wise, showing nary a hint of emotion beyond a slight smirk or chuckle here and there, which does cause a bit of a problem due to the fact that his was the lead role.    Thankfully, many of his supporting cast members were there to help mask his shortcomings as an actor.Rapper turned actor Bow Wow (formerly Lil' Bow Wow) has become quite the decent performer with roles ranging from TV appearances (\\"Smallville\\") to several feature films (\\"The Johnson Family Vacation\\" and \\"Roll Bounce\\"). Out of all the roles I have seen him in, I think that his character of Twink in this film, is probably the most interesting, and likely the most fun to play. From his eccentric taste in cars (an Incredible Hulk themed car), to his penchant for finding virtually any and every possible good that his customers requested, almost nothing about Twink was normal. Even though his character pushes the limits of believability in places, Bow Wow does his level best to keep the character as grounded as possible, and delivers a solid performance in the process.    Alongside Bow Wow was actor Sung Kang (\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\") as Han, a talented drifter, who befriends and trains Sean in the ways of drifting. Sung created a very interesting character in Han, by having him be as much of an outcast among the Asian community of street racers as Sean was being an American in their midst. I liked the way Sung always played Han as if he longed for a way out of the illegal street racing world he almost seems trapped by, and the way he looks at his \\"friends\\" in that world shows a clear contempt for some of the actions they take in order to get ahead. His was a character that was all about honor both on and off the track, and out of all the cast he was probably the most interesting of characters on display.    Aside from the three characters mentioned above, the remainder of the cast was relegated to either quasi-cameo appearances or merely one-dimensional antagonists. Most of the cast whether in a more developed role or not-so developed did a good job with their respective characters. Besides Lucas Black, who perhaps with acting classes could do much better work, the cast worked out very well, and managed to keep the movie's story interesting without relying solely on theracing to propel the film from start to finish.    \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\" was an energetic and fun ride that I'm sure introduced many of us to a new style of racing, but if you're like me you still preferred the other way instead. The film attempted to stand on its own as a movie without tying directly into what had come before it. In that respect, I feel that \\"Tokyo Drift\\" was a success of a movie; however, it sustained a much weaker box office than the previous two films, so perhaps this drastic of a change-up in a single installment wasn't the best of choices for this film's sake.    As a side note, the title for this movie seemed a bit too long in my estimation; couldn't we have just stuck a number 3 on the end of the original title and called it a day? That's all I'm saying.    \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B000002GKT|2.0|There is only one version of this gem that is truly worth the listen. And that version is the the 2007 24-bit Japan Mini-Sleeve Remaster. The U.S. release sound quality sucks and the 2006 Japan release is no better. However, the 2007 Japan remaster is greatly improved - a lot more dynamic range - sounds fresh for a 30+ year old live recording. Spend the extra money for this Rock classic, the quality speaks for its self. The 2007 version is out of print, but the search for a used copy is worth the effort!! Two stars for the US and 2006 Japan release - 5 STARS for the 2007 24-bit Japan Mini-Sleeve Remaster! Yes It's that GOOD!!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I am so happy that I got the new Kings of Leon cd.  I had heard it was great and now I understand what all of the fuss was about.  It is the only cd that I have played for weeks now.  Who knew these guys were so good!
0749453893|5.0|It amazes me that this book has not been written before! This is a fantastic reference piece that brings together all the bits and pieces we learned about using the internet as a marketing tool over the past 15 years - explaining mechanics, busting myths - into one place and providing a 'how-to' guide to doing it well. Damian and Calvin deserve a medal; every business that has ever struggled to understand how to use the internet to grow their business should buy this book immediately.
B001P22HK8|4.0|Appropriate for our tech times.  I've recommended it for my tech friends that normally wouldn't read fiction.  Highly recommended.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|First off, this movie is better on DVD than it was at the movies. With that being said, the film is still too short and it needed more of the Viola Davis character to make the movie more interesting.    The cast is stellar. Meryl Streep is flawless, but is basically playing a characiture of a dragon lady. Amy Adams is perfect as the innocent nun so is Hoffman as the \\"innocent\\" priest. Viola Davis is terrific in a most complicated role, which she brings to life with mesmerizing performance.    I have to say this though. I've seen The Reader in which Kate Winslet won her oscar over Meryl Streep for Doubt. And Streep got robbed. Winslet's part in The Reader was nowhere near as complicated as Streeps role. Streep conveys a wide range of emotions in Doubt, whilst Winslet just takes off her clothes and plays a moron. Winslet's role is not even really part that should of been nominated for oscar. HOWEVER, IT WAS KATE'S TURN TO WIN AN OSCAR--that's what Hollywood told us. It's crap. In my opion both Streep and Davis deserved awards for their work.
B001R10BM8|1.0|Regardless of the PQ of this Blu-ray, avoid this movie totally. It's a complete rip-off of a real Bond masterpiece... Thunderball. Connery was paid 5 million to do this movie, and that was a smart decision on his part. However; this movie is nearly unwatchable. The only simple pleasure you get is seeing Connery play 007 one more time. Otherwise the storyline is dull, familiar, and dragging throughout. This movie is on my list of Bonds I will never buy on Blu-ray. Those include Moonraker, Diamonds are Forever, You only Live Twice, The World is not Enough, A View To a Kill, and of course NSNA.
B000XA5K48|4.0|This movie was an enjoyable ride that didn't take itself at all<br />seriously, which probably makes it better than many an action movie out<br />there, where realism is suddenly interrupted by some unbelievable act<br />of derring-do. Riddled with guns, violence and profanity, this flick<br />pulls no punches and keeps the pedal to the metal. Funny, disturbing,<br />graphic, foul-mouthed, sexy and touching at various and simultaneous<br />times. Pays homage to John Woo's [[ASIN:B000N4SHNK Hard Boiled (Two-Disc Ultimate Edition)]] and is laced with<br />Tarantino-like humor. The stunts and gunplay are phenomenal. A<br />full-throttle adventure obviously designed to be over the top.<br /><br />Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti both do a fantastic job. And Monica<br />Belluchacabra isn't bad either as a lactating prostitute. I wouldn't<br />watch it with the wife, though. Much more of a guy flick.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I was thrilled  to receive IN TREATMENT from Amazon...so quickly.  The packaging was   so well done.  And it was the best show  I saw all last year.

1932100660|5.0|This book literally changed the way I look at my diet and health.  The facts are startling.  It's great to finally find real information about what we eat and how it affects us, without that information coming from a new \\"diet guru.\\"  Seems like everyone wants to tell you how and what to eat but they have a financial interest invested.  This book is based on facts, clinical studies, and real people.  Once you read it you'll never look at food the same way again.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I will not join the subtitle controversy, so I am not reviewing the DVD here, but rather the film, and as a film it is superb.  The words that come to mind are: evocative, stark, meditative, intelligent, deliberate, chill and haunting.      It is the heart of Swedish winter, those days of long nights, spare sunlight, a stark and barren landscape of winter sky and drifted snow, deep black and white, and a slim and delicate 12 year old boy living with his divorced mother, bullied at school, isolated and lonely meets a new neighbor, a strange girl near his age and in turn equally isolated and alienated from her surroundings.  A timid contact is made and a growing connection is made between the two kindred spirits, while eerie and bloody mayhem ensues.    Yes, it's a vampire film, but what is again demonstrated here is that when intelligence is brought to any genre you have something else quite unexpected and special.  The themes of loneliness, isolation and the heart and meaning of \\"strangeness\\" and the understanding of the \\"other\\" are subtext to a thriller that has some graphic and disturbing violence and gore, but done by film-makers with the sense to know that what you don't show can be just as effective or even more so than what you do show.    There has been good reason for the buzz around this film, coming out around the same time as bigger budgeted and hyped film and TV shows in the same genre.  This film demonstrates how atmosphere can be made by the accumulation of detail, carefully unfolding.  They don't play with the audience in that they get to the bloody business early on, but it is revealed with deliberate care.  It may sound incongruous to say, but the graphic gore is handled with tact.  It is the glimpsed horror you see and the further horror imagined.  It is the artful use of camera angle, and consideration of a building of tension and violence.  It isn't all about special effects, it is about using them to the greatest effect by not shoving them in the audience face all the time.    That and a mood of overall stillness.  There is something truly eerie about a brutal killing in the quiet of blanketed snow or in the middle of a sleek & blandly modern town square in dead winter night.  They captured it here and it is memorable.    The two young leads are well cast, the girl especially has a wonderful look that is both normal and otherworldly, especially here large, hypnotic eyes.  The rest is a marvelous evocation from an intelligent script and first rate production and direction.  Well done all around, nearly classic.
B00005CDNI|5.0|While it's difficult to pick a best Abba album, my vote goes to their 1979 release Voulez Vous. A true pop music masterpiece. The remaster version with bonus tracks Summer Night City and Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie is essential. Other favorites include As Good As New, I Have A Dream, Angeleyes, Does Your Mother Know, and the title track. If you like Abba this is a must-have CD.
1603420398|5.0|This is a great little book.  I can't wait to use the different patterns with different types of yarns to creat shawls, blankets, pillows, etc.  As an experienced crocheter I like the different techniques, but this would also be of benefit for the beginner as it gives detailed instructions and diagrams.  I'm very pleased.
0670020478|5.0|There are two main themes in this book. The first theme emphasized that we need to find the element (passion or talent) in us and follow our calling in order to have a life that is more successful and fulfilled.<br /><br />The second theme is on the state of our education system. Our education system, which inherits from the industrial revolution, has the tendency to produce mediocre individual by conformity and marginalized a lot of people with great potential. People are different, both physiologically and psychologically. Our education system which is design for a particular type of people does not always applies to every children, because of this reason, children with special talents but who do not fit into the education system are being cast out. This is a great loss to our society and civilization.<br /><br />This is a great book. This book speaks for me the views I have about passion (or Element) and our education system.<br /><br />I would also like to recommend another similar book titled [[ASIN:B001DZ2VUI Success Built to Last]].<br /><br />This book only emphasized the importance of passion but offers no technique in finding them. For readers who would like to know how to discover your passion or hidden potential. I would recommend [[ASIN:0743201140 Now, Discover Your Strengths]] or [[ASIN:159562015X StrengthsFinder 2.0: A New and Upgraded Edition of the Online Test from Gallup's Now, Discover Your Strengths]]. Both books contain an online test administered by Gallup, that could help you to find your potential. For those who do not wish to take the online test, I would recommend [[ASIN:0743261674 Go Put Your Strengths to Work: 6 Powerful Steps to Achieve Outstanding Performance]]<br /><br />After you have discovered your passion and your potential, it is time for you to work on it and to develop those potential into strength.

0061474355|5.0|Bravo Garth Nix! Bravo! For one who treasured Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy and looked high and low for something of similar scope with a strong female lead, this was a real treat. While reading a book like this it helps if one is capable of great flight of fancy because Nix's descriptions of the dead and Death had me delightfully terrified. This book often read to me like a reinvestigation of Dante's work and I marveled at Nix's imagination. Plus, as an aspiring crazy old cat lady, I was a huge fan of Sabriel's companion, Mogget, in his cat form. Overall, though this book is intended for younger audiences, I would classify it as high fantasy at its best. The only low point would be the rather rushed emergence of \\"love\\" between the protagonists. A few more scenes, however brief, earlier on to show how they began to care for each other would have been a good idea. Still, I am hooked and I will definitely be reading the next two books in the trilogy.
0316017922|2.0|The main theme of this book is to suggest that successful people are successful not only because of their passion or talent. There are other factors that influence the success of an individual such as the culture of hardworking, the knowledge of becoming successful and luck. Luck comprises of the time and era a person was born, their demographic composition, their culture and family background and the opportunities and advantages that were given to a person.<br /><br />Chapter Summary<br /><br />1. This chapter suggests that one factor that determines the success of a person depend on which month a person is born due to the selection process created by us.<br />2. Practice is the key of success. If you have put 10,000 hours to practice a skills, your chances of success is higher. The opportunity given to practice is as important as putting that many hours to practice.<br />3. This chapter uses the story of Chris Langan to stress that high IQ is not equivalent to success. As long as your IQ reaches certain threshold, any additional IQ will not bring any additional benefit to success. It also stress that high IQ is different from creativity.<br />4. Practical intelligence, or the knowledge of how to get want you want, saying the correct thing and the attitude, is as important as knowledge itself. To be successful, a person has to be prepared on how to get around this world.<br />5. Your demographic composition and the era in which you were born, play a part in determining your success.<br />6. Cultures legacies, tradition and attitude we inherit from our ancestor can influence our success.<br />7. This chapter uses Hofstede's culture dimension such as the ability to stand up against authority to indicate that such culture dimension also determines our success.<br />8. This chapter explores the culture of hardworking as a key factor in becoming successful in Mathematics.<br />9. Successful people are successful because they were given opportunities and advantages; and they are able to seize the opportunities.<br />10. The final chapter concludes that success is the product of history, legacies, demographic, and web of advantages and opportunities.<br /><br />Although I agree with the main idea of this book, but such factors to success are uncontrollable.

B001K3JF7K|3.0|The album \\"Quiet Nights\\" sounds great on paper, but the album was a bit disappointing. Diana's voice is great but I'm not crazy about the arrangements of many of the songs. A lot of the songs sounded so layered that by the fifth or sixth song, I was tired of listening to the orchestra. I prefer some of her early albums to this effort, but the CD is still worth a listen, just don't buy it until you have sampled the album first.
0316010669|4.0|The main idea of this book is to explore how we use our subconscious (or instinct, or gut feeling) to make day to day decision.  This instinctive decision helps us to manage our day to day life and response in emergency. This instinctive decision which made very quickly can be as good as decision made cautiously and deliberately. However, the very subconscious can also be dangerous, betray us and could cause us in making wrong decision. The second part of this book explore when should we trust our instinct and we should not. The final part of this book shows us how we could and educate control our snap judgment and first impression.<br /><br />We can know a lot about the person during first impression, as our subconscious mind is unconsciously finding patterns in situation and behavior while sizing up a person. This can also be done deliberately by observing small details. We could not explain how we derive certain decision which usually influence or based on our subconscious decision.<br /><br />Our subconscious is sometimes influence by our unconscious bias. This unconscious bias may have negative impact on our decision. However, this unconscious bias can be controlled using positive association.<br /><br />Good decision making relies on deliberate and instinctive thinking. In good decision making, less information is better than more information. More information will overload decision maker with noise because the additional information does not provide additional value.<br /><br />Using the example of tasting Pepsi and Coke, this chapter illustrates the result of focus group, which uses ordinary people for marketing research, may not be reliable. This is especially true when the members are made to think about their instinctive decision. The expert in a field have better judgment as compare to the focus group because their expertise allows them to have a better understanding on their unconscious decision on  the subject they specialized.  This chapter concludes by empathizing that our subconscious decisions are not necessarily wrong, however, they are shallow, hard to explain and easily disrupted.<br /><br />As we are emotionally arouse in an emergency situation our ability to collect and analyze information narrows. Our split second decision can lead us into trouble especially when we are under stress or in an emergency. This however can be control by slowing down our heart beat. By slowing down our heart beat, we can react better as our ability to analyze the situation increase. On a separate note, this chapter also mentioned that we could read peoples emotion by studying their facial expression.<br /><br />The final chapter concludes that we can avoid making wrong decision from our subconscious by isolating any factor that could mislead our judgment.nscious decisions are not necessarily wrong, however, they are shallow, hard to explain and easily disrupted.

B000VJ271A|5.0|I recently purchased the DVD of Jules Massenet's opera Manon as performed by Natalie Dessay and Rolando Villazon at the GranTheatre del Liceu in Barcelona.  In a word, this is a superb performance by the lead singers.    Dessay has a beautiful voice and uses it with intelligence and her portrayal of Manon is about as human as you can get.  She is a consumate actress, able to express the many-faceted traits of the heroine.  Dessay moves easily about the stage, singing naturally and thrillingly throughout. Her interpretation of Manon is very believable.  She is one with Manon, living and breathing as thouigh she is Manon herself.    Villazon sings a thrilling Des Grieux.  His voice has a bright ring to it and he interprets Des Grieux convincingly.  I am not at ease with Villazon's vocal technique and I wonder how he gets such good results since he seems to sing inwardly rather than pushing the voice out. But it is a time honored adage that says: \\"You don't argue with success!\\" and Villazon has earned his place among the top tenors of the operatic world legitimately and justly.    Dessay and Villazon do not sing/act Manon and Des grieux - they ARE Manon and Des Grieux. They are involved with each other, interacting at every level of an interrelationship between lovers. You laugh with them and you suffer along with them. They draw the audience into the very vortex of their turbulent experiences.  This performance will leave no one unaffected.    This a well sung performance by and large, though not all the singers are up to the demands of their respective roles - Manuel Lanza is unable to hit the high notes squarely on the head during the climaxes - he almost does but falls short.  Sadly, Samuel Ramey as Le Comte Des Grieux has seen better days. The voice is wobbly and unfocussed. His was a stellar career and he was worthy of the acclaim he received in his vocal prime. The supporting cast contributed to the overall high standards of the performance as does the orchestraunder the baton of Victor Pablo Perez.    Certainly, this is a DVD well worth owning and I recommend it highly to all opera lovers. One would be hard pressed to find a better duo than Dessay and Villazon in this opera.

B000YMUEDC|5.0|I'm not really a7x fan...i thought City of Evil sucked....but this Album is heavy and hard hitting...some other reviews on here are from people who are obviously soft and can't take a true hard-hitter like this album. SO what if it's screaming?
630469654X|4.0|Little more remains to be said. Excellent film. Horrible soundtrack (although I disagree with other reviewers. I, and everyone I saw the film with when it was first released, thought the soundtrack was horrible back then as well (not cutting-edge, but something that should have been cut (silence would have been preferable to this lousy A.P.P. refuse)).    One of my favorite things about this film is that it is a good 'family film' in that it is enjoyable for everyone, not too scary for the kiddies, and doesn't require that adults remove their brain for viewing or adopt an 'Adam Sandler' or 'Three Stooges' level of humor (as most 'family films' seem to do)    Is there any chance this gem will receive a 25th anniversary special treatment? I, and a lot of others would line up for it. Warner? Are you listening? Even 'Legend' got an 'Ultimate Edition' and it isn't half the film this is.
B00007K02F|5.0|An excellent version of the very true story of a woman who is in each life of every individual. It is basically about her true spirit in a fight with life to keep going.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|I was lucky enough to see \\"Doubt\\" on stage but the film version is far superior.  The acting is not acting.  You feel all the characters pain.  I am glad I didn't see the movie version before the Oscars because I feel that all of the acting in this movie was worthy of the Oscar.  It is beyond what I thought it would be and you keep thinking about it long after the movie is over.  I believe this movie will outlast \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" and the other movies that won the Oscars this year.  Don't miss one of the best if not the best movie of this year or any year.

0762434279|1.0|When I received the 3\\" x 2.5\\" mini-book, I thought it was a joke. Abbreviated is one thing, but the size of this book was disgraceful. It taugh me one thing though, I will now have to read the dimensions of the books Amazon sells. Hopefully, Amazon, or whoever sells a miniature book, will make sure the size of their wares, especially if it is shoking is diminsion, would be more predominately mentioned considering their marketing reputation. Maybe photographing this book next to a quarter would have given a clue. Shame on Amazon for making it appear to be as large as a normal book. Shame on me for not always assuming that all books are generally the same size, and not reading the diminsions of the book found in amoung the other misc. information.

B000JVSUS4|5.0|I caught this movie on HD cable over the weekend and was blown away by how good it is!  The acting was first class and the special effects were phenomenal.  The story revolves around Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett who are best friends and both fall in love with Kate Beckensdale.  Many people (myself included) thought that this would be a rip-off of the Leo DeCaprio/Kate Winslet story of Titanic.  It is nothing of the sort.  Though Affleck and Harnett are love rivals, they remain true friends throughout.      The story is loaded with several little subplots that happen during the attack and Beckensdale's character has some awesome scenes as a nurse trying to deal with all the wounded and being a calming influence on many fatally injured.    The story does not end with the attack but continues with a daring mission undertaken by Harnett and Affleck with an extraordinary performance by Alec Baldwin as their leader and trainer.  The actor that portrays FDR is also excellent and has some great moments of his own.  Each of these actors could easily have won an Oscar for their performance.  Try not to miss this one while it is still free on cable!
0743298039|3.0|The book is overall very slow, in fact the majority of the time it is very slow. Of course it had some high points & enough to keep me interested...but for the most part i couldn't wait to finish to move on to something more interesting.
B000WZAE1I|2.0|This is a fairy tale with lots of magic and famous actors.  It is not a film for children because plot goes in too many directions at times.  It is meant to be a British production so even American actors (Claire Danes andMIchelle Pfeifer) have fake british accents that disappear half way through the movie.  Robert DeNiro is a complete miscast as a transvestite pirate and he does not even make an attempt to fake his accent.<br /><br />Sorry, but I found this movie to be a drag.
B00006D295|5.0|There are so many things that I can say about my history with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. We'll just say that it took a few years for it to really grow on me, and one day, it just clicked. Now I love it. It's one of my favorite musicals. I love how no-holds-barred weird it is...and it is WEIRD! I mean, you have an obvious homage to B-movies, sci-fi, and horror all rolled into one crazy storyline - and some of the strangest songs ever written - all thrown up on the screen, and right in your face. Speaking of the songs, they're all great. Ridiculously goofy, but great! You have all of these elements tucked in to the creepy haunted house/laboratory atmosphere, and it works in it's own strange way. Most of it looks incredibly cheap, which compliments the film.     And then theres the cast. First of all, Tim Curry tears up the screen. I mean, he chews up every bit of scenery in which he is present! The other actors don't have time to breathe around him, although they are excellent as well. Susan Surandon and Barry Bostwick play our \\"hero\\" and our \\"heroine\\", Brad and Janet - one of the nerdiest couples ever committed to the silver screen. You've got to see it to believe it. Back to Tim Curry. I don't know whether to call his performance Oscar worthy or not, but it sure comes close. It takes a REAL MAN to dress up in a teddy and fishnets they way that he does...once you get over the initial shock of his character, you end up laughing your head off. He's hilarious...and he really gets in to it!     Strangely enough, I prefer Rocky Horror on it's own, without the audience participation. I tried that one time. Had no idea what I was getting in to at the time. I went dressed in khaki pants and a button down dress shirt, very spiffy. I felt so out of place. People kept staring at me. I found that I couldn't enjoy the film what with all of the screaming and yelling. However, I did like the fact that we got to throw rice and shoot water guns in the theatre. That was the only part of the interactive experience that I enjoyed. I'd much rather watch it on my own, late at night, preferably with a thunderstorm booming on outside for the sake of ambience...    It's one of the great camp classics of all time, if you can just give in to it! It really depends on who you are. If you are easily offended, you'll cut it off within the first 20 minutes or so. If not, you'll love it!

As soon as the credits roll, scenes from the film tumble around in your mind, causing you to seriously evaluate what you have just seen. You come up with your own interpretation of the events.     Directed by John Patrick Shanley from his own play, DOUBT tells the story of an uptight, extremely conservative nun who suspects foul play in the church, when the new priest is suspected of molesting a black student. The nun, Sister Aloysius Beauvier, has good reason to accuse the progressive, somewhat libral priest of the crime. Or does she? That's one of the many questions that the film asks the characters on screen, as well as the audience. Are things REALLY what they seem to be? Or is Sister Aloysius simply out to pick a fight? She doesn't like change. Father Brendan Flynn is all for it, and he constantly tries to break through Aloysius' tough exterior. Times have changed, he says, and so must she. It is no suprise that she takes aim at him the first chance that she gets - but, once again, does she have good reason? Did the priest really molest the boy or not? Is there any reason to doubt that he did? The film presents the argument from both sides, and in my opinion, is very ambiguous in it's conclusion.      This film is carried by the dialogue and acting, which is amazing. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymore Hoffman, and Amy Adams give some of the best performances of the year. Amy Adams shines as a young and naive nun who gives Streep reason to question Hoffman.     SEE IT! You'll be thinking afterwards!
B001N4TIHI|3.0|This movie which I watched twice,because I missed the beginning the 1st time,has a great cast and beaufiful scenery.The story is ok.the acting decent,but I loved the house which Meg Ryan lives in.I know its a shallow reason to rewatch a movie but to me I love to see how characters live and what their home is like .Call me shallow, but I would watch it a third time for that reason and it is a decent msovie.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This film is amazing. The acting. The direction. Everything is perfect! The story reminded me of \\"Oliver Twist\\". You all know the story by now, so I will not go into the details. I'll just tell you that if you have not seen it, do so, as soon as possible! The acting is top-notch, all around. The characters really come to life, and you want to see them succeed! Yes, there is a Hollywood ending. The good thing about this one is that it does not feel forced. The story ends perfectly.     It's also a much needed dose of reality. The rough depiction of life in the slums is unforgettable. Danny Boyle has always been an amazing director, and I love his work. This film is no exception! This film does have it's critics, but I'd advise you to see the film and judge for yourself! Don't let anyone stop you from seeing it.     Oh, and the soundtrack is amazing! Stay for the end credits.    SEE IT!

0679405631|5.0|The core of the plot in The Woman in White is a secret that threatens and controls the lives of four individuals: Sir Percival Glyde, Laura Fairlie, Marian Halcombe, and Walter Hartright.  Laura Fairlie's marriage to Percival Glyde was arranged by Laura's father prior to his death. However, before vows are exchanged, Laura meets Walter Hartright, an artist employed by Laura's recluse, hypochondriac uncle, as a drawing tutor for his nieces.     Laura and Walter fall in love, but the young lovers are torn apart when Laura's sister, Marian, discovers the couple's secret affection. Out of love for her sister, Marian urges Walter to leave Limmeridge House, a tragic and unfortunate action which Marian will soon regret. Why? Sir Percival Glyde married Laura for her money and Laura's fortune and life hang in the balance.     Glyde is a dangerous man with a secret. The one person who knows Percival Glyde's secret is the mysterious woman in white, which the book was named after. The woman in white is Anne Catherick, a mentally unstable woman who escaped an asylum. Glyde is terrified of the woman and relentlessly pursues her throughout the book.     Laura Fairlie, later called Lady Glyde, is somewhat of a wallflower and the epitome of the damsel in distress. Marian Halcombe, Laura's resourceful and highly intelligent half-sister, is the star of the show. It is up to her to discover Glyde's secret in order to preserve her sister's life and her own. When Walter Hartright reenters the story, the two are unstoppable. The twosome engage in some serious sleuthing that is sure to keep you glued to the story.     The novel is effectively and brilliantly narrated by cast of characters, each relaying their part in the unfortunate story of Lady Glyde. The Woman in White was one of the finest sensation novels of the nineteenth century. It was originally published in magazines, such as Charles Dickens's \\"All The Year Round\\" and was one of Wilkie Collins greatest novels. If you love detective novels, this is one book you cannot pass up.
1439138311|4.0|Brooklyn begins with Eilis, a young Irish woman, preparing to leave her small town in Ireland in the early 1950s to emigrate to Brooklyn.  When Eilis arrives in America, she is overwhelmed, by the size of New York, the different types of people, and her new life.  As she slowly adapts to her dull job as a shop clerk and her night classes at a local college, she begins to feel comfortable in this new life and her life in Ireland feels distant and strange.  She even meets and falls in love with Tony, a young Italian American.  When Eilis is suddenly recalled to Ireland after a family tragedy, she is re-confronted with her old life and must choose, is she the old Eilis or the new?<br /><br />Although Brooklyn is a slow, quiet novel, and it took me a while to get into, in the end I loved this book.  Toibin has a great way of capturing the everyday details of life and making them poignant and often beautiful.  Nothing extraordinary happens in this book, but Eilis does have to make a huge decision that will alter the course of her entire life.  The way Toibin presents this choice feels authentic without being overwrought, which is what makes this novel so good. In the end I was sad to see this novel finish, and I wished I could glimpse just a bit more of Eilis' world.<br /><br />The novel also does a suburb job of capturing the attitudes and prejudices of first and second generation immigrants in Brooklyn in the 1950s.  The changes that are about to fundamentally change America are beginning to take route, and Toibin addresses them quietly, as subtle changes in the everyday lives of his characters.  Toibin's attention to these issues made the novel feel very authentic, and added to its quiet charm.

B001N44BVQ|2.0|The easiest way to summarize it is not smart enough to be Syrianna and the action didn't compare to The Kingdom.    It sort of attempts to do both and comes up neither.    That, and a muddled storyline don't help.  I'm not sure what to make of it other than the so-what ideas that: a) there's plenty of jihadists that hate us and will kill us no matter what and b) we've done plenty throughout history to incite this kind of behavior.  Not exactly a newsflash.    What is also completely distracting is Crowe's first peformance ever where I didn't buy it.  He's so completely superficial and they pound home the point that Leo's in the desert getting shot at while Crowe shuttles his kids to school plays, conducting war via cellphone.  Not exactly subtle.    DiCaprio is solid but hardly able to save this mess.  Far more superior are the aforemetioned Syriana or The Kingdom, if you want to see DiCaprio in a political action thriller that does hit on all cylinders, try Blood Diamond.
0316017922|4.0|An excellent report on the ingredients that result in successful endeavors, and that success comes to those who take advantage of the greatest opportunities which are bestowed upon them.  Also, the cultural experience of a person defines their attitude, approach to life, probability of success, and the struggles they might face in certain work settings.  It is difficult to argue with an author who is meticulous and in depth as Malcolm Gladwell. It is good food for thought and discussion.
B00127RAJY|5.0|A co-worker of mine suggested this dvd since I was getting frustrated with hitting a standstill with some other workouts I have done. She said I would see a difference almost immediately and boy was she right!! I am now on Day 9, still on level 1 and have noticed a huge difference! This dvd is kicking my butt into shape!! The first few days I thought I was going to die and not make it through but I kept pushing and the work shows. Her book says to do the shred for 5 days and take 1 day off. After my day off this week I am going to attempt level 2 and see how that goes but it's nice to see results so quickly which is definitely motivating me to keep going! I can't wait to finish the 30 days and see where I am at, but I have definition in my muscles and my clothes are already fit ALOT better! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!
B001PA0FFO|5.0|\\"Doubt\\" is an adaptation of the acclaimed theatrical play by John Patrick Stanley, set in a small Catholic school in 1964, as the nation and Church are poised for great social change. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a friendly, easy-going man who teaches the boys basketball at the St. Nicholas School and gives the 8th graders light-hearted advice on their nascent social lives. The school's principal, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), is a humorless disciplinarian suspicious of Flynn's outgoing disposition and progressive ideas. Those suspicions infect a kindly young nun, Sister James (Amy Adams), who reports some unusual behavior of the school's first and only black student (Joseph Foster) after a private meeting with Father Flynn. That's enough to convince Sister Aloysius that Flynn is a child molester who must be driven out.<br /><br />John Patrick Stanley took inspiration from the Catholic school he attended as a child in the Bronx and a nun of the Sisters of Charity who was a favorite teacher. He adapted the play for the screen himself and also directs the film. I wondered if this might result in a movie that looks like a play on film, but I was pleasantly surprised by the its beauty. Roger Deacons' cinematography makes an impression immediately, while the opening credits are still rolling. He has created many striking shots, including some unexpected canted shots that don't seem unnatural or self-conscious. \\"Doubt\\" is still a film whose action takes place in conversations between its characters; it's not visually dynamic. But it is visually captivating -much  moreso than I expected from a film that is about the interactions between four people in one location.<br /><br />The secret of \\"Doubt\\"'s success may be that it is perceived differently by different people. I don't think there is agreement on what it's all about. At first the audience wonders if Father Flynn is guilty of misconduct. Eventually, we don't care, because so many other interesting questions have been raised. People are not what we expected and not what they expected of each other. There is a lot going on in the minds of these characters, and that's where the story lies. The idea of \\"doubt\\" is curious, because Sister Aloysius never has proof of anything; she only has her certainty. She banishes doubt, because she is incapable of acting without certainty. Many people wouldn't sweat the doubts so much in condemning their enemy.<br /><br />Is it acceptable to stray from the values that we claim to espouse in the pursuit of justice? Are we to condemn people for what they do or for what they are? \\"Doubt\\" raises a host of contemporary issues in a confined period drama. The most amazing thing it does is to introduce a third perspective, just when we're thinking that the battle is between Sister Aloysius' obsessive intolerance and Father Flynn's conspicuous kindness. The perspective is that of the boy's mother, Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), who turns everything upside down in just one scene. I laughed out loud at Sister Aloysius' reaction: \\"This will not do.\\" The actors pack so much into their performances. \\"Doubt\\" is a thought-provoking film and a bit of a chameleon.<br /><br />The DVD ( Miramax 2009): There are 4 featurettes and an audio commentary. \\"From Stage to Screen\\" (19 min) interviews John Patrick Stanley about his inspiration for the play and adapting it for the screen, as well as the actors and production designer David Gropman. \\"The Cast of Doubt\\" (14 min) is an interview of the principle cast by Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly. In \\"Scoring Doubt\\" (4 1/2 min), composer Howard Shore and Shanley talk about the music. \\"Sisters of Charity\\" (6 1/2 min) interviews 4 nuns from the Sisters of Charity order, including the woman who inspired the Sister James character, about their lifestyle then and now.  The audio commentary by John Patrick Shanley talks a great deal about the time and place in which the story takes place. He also offers some information on visual decisions, sets, and filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish. Dubbing available in French.filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish. Dubbing available in French.

B00005JLR2|5.0|Treasure Planet is one hour and thirty-five minutes and was released on November 27, 2002. The Disney movie is an update version of Treasure Island with a mixture of old and new technology. The movie revolves around a teenage boy named Jim Hawkins; whose father abandoned him years ago and secretly yearns for a father figure. One evening a spaceship crashes near the inn. A turtle like creature emerges from the ship calling himself Billy Bones. He tells Jim pirates are after his treasure. Once inside, Billy Bones give Jim an orb package and warns him of the cyborg. Just a few seconds later a gang of pirates arrives and tear the inn apart looking for the orb. Jim, his mother, and Dr. Delbert Doppler manage to escape before they are capture. They arrive at the home of Dr. Doppler and Jim opens the package and discovers that the orb is a map of the universe and a map to Treasure Planet and Captain Flint's treasure. Dr. Doppler hires a crew and ship and the two set sail for a treasure hunt. Captain Amelia makes Jim a Cabin Boy and assigns him to John Silver, the ship's cook and a cyborg. Jim suspects John Silver is the cyborg. Originally John and Jim wanted nothing to do with each other, but during the course of the movie John sort of become the father figure Jim is looking for. During a black hole storm First Mate Mr. Arrow is lost to a black hole when his life line is cut by Scroop, but Jim blames himself because he was put in charge of securing the life lines. RLS Legacy reaches Treasure Planet a mutiny takes place. Jim, Captain Amelia, and Dr. Doppler crash land on the planet. Once on the planet, Jim shows Amelia that the map is safe, but when he takes it out of his pocket it is actually Morph. Amelia is injured during the landing and tells Jim to scout ahead to find shelter. Jim and Morph run into B.E.N. B.E.N. claims to have literally lost his memory. B.E.N. invites them to take shelter in his place. Later that evening B.E.N., Morph, and Jim escape through a back toand head back to the ship to get the map. The trio recover the map and head back to the hideout and find John Silver and his gang has capture Amelia and Doppler and are about to kill them when John cannot get the orb to work. Finally he strikes up a deal and the prisoners all go with the pirates. Jim finds Captain Flint hideout and the treasure, but in doing unknowingly so set off a destruct signal. Jim and B.E.N. are at Captain Flint ship when Jim finds B.E.N. and put it back on. B.E.N., with his memory restored tells Jim why Flint took it off in the first place. He did so no one would find his treasure and if they did would set off a plant self destruct signal. It is a race to get off the planet. Jim, B.E.N., and John arrive back at the ship; however the ship is damaged and does not lack the fire power to get off the planet. Jim tells Doppler to turn the ship around because he is heading for the orb to set the portal to his home world. Everybody makes it out of the explosion alive and Jim helps John to escape. John leaves Jim with some treasure so his mom can rebuild her inn. Captain Amelia and Dr. Delbert Doppler get married, Jim's mom opens a new inn, and Jim makes his mom proud of him.

The campaign and the election of Barack Obama is an enormous step in the history of our country, and will be remembered that way for generations. It is the first time in the history of America that we have had a non-white president. The book is worth reading just to understand what the REAL American dream is all about and what really is possible in America, no matter who you are.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|This is not a movie you forget. The moral difficulty is of knowing her before you know her past and before you understand why she made her decisions. I think you would have done the same thing. And so would he. But just because the decisions seem easier from the third-person vantage point, doesn't make the movie a moral cake-walk. It's challenging partly because your feelings have been compromised by her present before being tainted by her past. I'll watch this move over again.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|I haven't read Mrs. Gaskell's book, so I was able to watch this DVD with no reader's pre-conception about how the story was adapted and/or the changes to its plot.  I was willing to enjoy what I hoped, from everything I'd heard and read about it, was a typical high-quality British TV production.<br /><br />And there are qualities about this production that I did enjoy, very much.  Tim Piggott-Smith's performance as Rev. Hale; Sinead Cusack's performance as Hannah Thornton (where has this actress been? one never sees her enough and she's so good), and Richard Armitage as John Thornton, are excellent.  The attention paid to the Victorian-era details - the costumes; the household furnishings; the contrast between the damp and gloomy northern mill town as opposed to the flowering southern vicarage where the Hales come from.  And I loved the soundtrack - what perfectly suited-to-this-story music.<br /><br />But, I had some problems with casting choices, the first one (relatively minor) being the actor who played Paul Hale.  With his shaggy hair falling into his eyes and certain mannerisms, this actor struck me as a bit too 21st century to be playing a young man of the 19th century.  More seriously the biggest problem I had was the performance of Daniela Denby-Ashe as Margaret.  I still don't quite know if it was the actress playing her, or the character of Margaret as written, or a combination of both factors, but by the second episode and as the story continued, I was experiencing an increasingly negative feeling toward her.  Certainly the actress's nearly-chipmunk cheeked, pudding face with its pink-lidded eyes and usually vacant expression and blank stares (only ever fully awake during exchanges or arguments with Thornton), gradually began annoying the heck out of me.  I admit that by the last episode, I would have hoped Margaret and John didn't reconcile, if only one couldn't see it coming a mile away... All my sympathies at that point were with Mrs. Thornton, especially when she criticized Margaret to John Thornton.  I felt exactly the same way.<br /><br />Thus, unfortunately, the very romantic ending to the series, at the train station, didn't find favor with me, the way it seems to have affected so many other female viewers.  That last glimpse of Margaret's face, turned away from John to look out the train window, was the last straw.  Turned away to look out the window, from the man who's just pledged his undying love for her!  Why would a director choose this ending?  The only thing that saved that scene, for me, was the music welling up in the background.<br /><br />If I were to purchase anything regarding this production (the DVD was a library loan) it will be the soundtrack, if it's available.  I did enjoy the production for the majority of the performances and for its attention to detail, but because I just didn't have the overwhelmingly positive reaction that most viewers seem to have had for Richard Armitage/Daniela Denby-Ashe's so-called chemistry, I personally can't speak to fully enjoying this adaptation.  Obviously many viewers felt much differently!<br /><br />****<br />This is my third, and last, attempt to leave a review of this particular television mini-series.  I would appreciate if certain of the 370+ positive reviewers of this DVD, some of whom left borderline hostile/rude comments which unfortunately got deleted (and no, this was not my intention), and who thought this series was a five-star-or-even-more, utterly wonderful and fantastic viewing experience, would take into account that my review actually was not written to thoughtlessly \\"bash\\" this TV miniseries.  I've stated one major problem I had with it which affected MY total enjoyment of the production.  I agree 100% that any other viewer of \\"North and South\\" might think Daniela Denby-Ashe is fabulous as Margaret, but I, personally, didn't find her performance that great.  There are a few reviews on Amazon.co.uk that concur with my opinion about herperformance.<br /><br />Thanks.
0670020478|5.0|I first saw Ken Robinson in a TED Talk a few months ago. (Google: TED Ken Robinson) He was witty and engaging. Most TED Talks are, but Ken Robinson is in the Pareto top 20% or so (in my view) and so is his book [[ASIN:0670020478 The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything]]. I had recently read Daniel Pink [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future]] and was open to this kind of encouragement of creative thinking and working in an ever-changing world.<br /><br />The book is a true page-turner, with personal examples, at least a few of which I was familiar with, and struck home with their telling fine line between an ordinary life and the extraordinary lives they turned out to be, just because there was an inspiring and observant teacher, doctor, parent, or mentor at hand during a critical period.<br /><br />Many of the examples are of youthful discoveries of their personal Element that became their passion and life endeavor. But others are of middle aged and older people. I'm reminded that Thomas Hobbes didn't write his great book [[ASIN:0199537283 Leviathan (Oxford World's Classics)]] until he was around 50.<br /><br />And the shear coincidentality of the the discoveries is almost frightening. I've just finished reading [[ASIN:0670913782 Bomb, Book and Compass: Joseph Needham and the Great Secrets of China. by Simon Winchester]] in which an almost chance meeting and romance of Joseph Needham and a Chinese postgraduate student led to the conception, research, writing, and publication of [[ASIN:052105799X Science and Civilization in China. Volume 1: Introductory Orientations]] and his life's work.<br /><br />We don't know what may be around the corner which will inspire us to greatness, or at the very least to a personal passion that we would not do without once discovered. The Element will give you pointers to how to recognize and even create the conditions for finding your own Element.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost really pushed itself into the sci-fi realm in its fifth season. As I write this there are only 4 episodes left to finish off the current season.<br />Time travel plays an integral part especially in the early episodes when those left on the island experiences \\"flashes\\" and find themselves in earlier years on the island.<br />So much is the time travel that it's almost a relief when midway through the season we get back to character-centric episodes that deal primarily with the Oceanic Six and how they came to be on the plane that would bring them back to the island to save those left behind.<br />Jack becomes annoying, and Kate gets a little stupid andI found myself rooting for Juliet and Sawyer.<br />As usual Sayid, Ben and Locke are the focus of the more entertaining episodes.<br />Lost is a classic and this penultimate season will be remembered as the one that finally began answering all the questions from prior years (just have a notebook by your side for the first 6 episodes).

The sound on this re-master is much better - my older \\"Chronicles\\" sounds like the muSic was being heard through a thin wall - the sound was blunted at the low and high ends.      And what is particualrly surprising wonderful is hearing the entire album - not just the hits.  Yes, the album is short, but it is honest qwell played music.  No pretentions. Americana and timeless.    Suddenly I am in a time capsule - studying for a high school biology exam...listening to \\"Effigy.\\"      There was this one year when Creedence might have been my favorite band - when I was a kid and saved up and bought all three records they put out...1969.

While I'm still not quite over the death of my favorite magazine, this book (and the back issues!) provide some solace.

B001EYGOEM|4.0|I like Taylor Swift. She seems to be a nice and intelligent girl. Taylor's songwriting is great (she writes better songs that Shania Twain), but Taylor is no singer. Right now, people are interested in her because she is young, pretty, blonde, and a good songwriter with a great spirit. However, her charms and looks will only get her so far and I suspect as she matures, people will demand for her to put more punch into her sound or will tire of her easily and find another singer.    Vocally, Taylor is very limited. She lacks tone, her country accent is forced, and her vocals are rather monotone (no fire whatsoever). Studio machines covers up what her live performances cannot. Now, I don't want to blast Taylor too harshly because she is only 18 and I do see some hope on this album.     Love Story is a mid-tempo, accompanied by banjo and guitar in which she sings about her Romeo whom her father will not let her see. White Horse is a country pop ballad which talks about her being rejected in a relationship. The song is quite beautiful.I also enjoy Fifteen, Change and You Belong With Me.    Taylor has a promising future, but as she gets older she will need to rely less on fairy tale themes and more on stronger/diverse vocals. 2 1/2 Stars.

0743455967|4.0|I had no idea that Stephen King wrote a book on writing until a friend of mine quoted it during a greasy spoon breakfast at a downtown eatery. Intrigued, especially after reading Hemingway On Writing, I ran out to my local bookstore and bought it: no time to wait for Amazon to deliver. I dove right in and was pleasantly surprised.    In addition to getting some bare bones writing advice, I was privy to a glimpse of King's life as a would be writer then novelist. I think this rounds the book out nicely. To have a book on writing listing the importance of grammar, spelling, and vocabulary would be a colossal waste of time. On Writing is bare bones in advice for writers and it should be. There is no magic formula in story telling. It's just that: telling a story. As a writer, one should try to tell a story to the best of his or her ability. If it doesn't work then write another one. The only way to improve one's writing is to write and, as Stephen King pointed out in his book, read.    As for the snapshots of King's life, they were the bonuses of the book. I would have been bored to tears if it was on the mechanics of writing, and I'm a writer! Give me some drama for my mama mixed in with some practical advice any day.     Read On Writing and enjoy it for what it is and nothing else. If you're looking for a book on how to become a successful working writer, keep looking. This isn't a magical potion, it's just the basics with a story.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|A little uneven from one episode to the next, but overall an interesting and well-acted series. Needs to be taken a little at a time. Not a cliff-hanger or action type film--nearly all of it takes place in a psychiatrist's office. My overall impression is that it vacilates between a high class soap opera and a serious drama.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|To be honest, I never really cared too terribly for most of the films that have been awarded \\"best picture\\" by the Academy (there are some exceptions).    While \\"Slumdog\\" does rate very high in my own personal \\"academy\\", I really don't feel that it deserved the best picture award. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I did find some of it's premises to be strectching it in terms of reality and believability.    The acting, by all players young, old and not-so-old, is highly commendable, especially some of the younger talent, which I have learned had little to no acting experience. The story, although a little too unrealistic in some parts, is well-written and told with a sort-of \\"flashback\\" methodology which I found to be different and refreshing. The ending, although a bit sappy, is uplifting. I was sooooo thankful that they saved the big \\"dance number\\" for the credits (I know it's the \\"in\\" thing to do in Bollywood, but in this film it would have seemed completely silly and ruined the feel of the whole thing).    All in all, a VERY good film, but to me, it shouldn't have been picture of the year. My personal vote was for \\"Gran Torino\\".    There is a bit of violence (some graphic, some not so much) and just a smattering of foul language, but because of the overall adult theme of the show, I recommend you keep the kiddies away.
0375842209|4.0|I read about this book because my mother's group will discuss it at their book club. I decided to read it because my mother was born in Hamburg in 1936. After repeatedly running home to hide in the bomb shelters for air raids, my Mom was finally sent south to live with relatives. To this day she hates peanut butter, thunder and fireworks - and she does not use the word \\"hate\\". They were actually fed peanut soup because it was nourishing, but, according to my Mom, not the tastiest. I thought this book might give me an insight into the life she led. By the end of the book, I was happy I had read it, but it did not leave me feeling full. I now will research and find the additional books to help me in my journey. I can see why this book is directed toward young readers, but realize it is a harsh reality. And knowing that people actually were so cruel is difficult to digest.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|The Nikon SB-400 has performed just as advertised. I own a Nikon D40 and a D300. I do mostly scenic phtography and not really much work with a flash however after testing the SB-400, I think I'll be doing more photography using a fill flash.  I was very impressed at the improved quality and life-like colors that using it produced.  I thought that the built in flash was all I really needed until I saw the results.    Read all the reviews on this flash and go with them! Can't beat the price either as that was my main reason for choosing it.  My flash needs didn't really warrant spending a lot of money on a 600 or 800.

0061020680|4.0|Ages since I've  read one, and it got me in and laughing. I think I might prefer his earlier books, perhaps a bit less preachy.<br /><br />As ever Pratchett delivers some lovely descriptions, characters and events.<br /><br />I don't quite know why he frequently goes so hard for a suspenseful climax - the rules of the universe are being so constantly bent and toyed with that we all know that whatever is a threat can be overturned in a moment - this one was almost as bad as `it was all a dream', as as an afterthought death mentions having a quiet word with the gods, making, of course, a mockery of all the agonising of the previous few chapters.<br />But if you stick to the wonderful ideas and descriptions and leave the plot behind, this is a fun read.
0156421178|4.0|HOMAGE TO CATALONIA has two narratives. The first discusses the experiences of Orwell from December 1936 through June 1937, when he fought as a common soldier in a socialist (POUM) brigade against the Fascists, recuperated from a nearly fatal sniper's bullet, and then fled Spain as a British bourgeois tourist as POUM soldiers were arrested and imprisoned in Barcelona in a Communist-led purge.<br /><br />This narrative of first-hand experience is absolutely first rate, with Orwell's writing perfectly clear, beautifully paced, and completely riveting. Within this narrative, highlights are Chapter 7, where Orwell participates in an assault on a Fascist redoubt at the front; Chapter 12, where he describes being shot in the neck and its aftermath; and Chapters 13 and 14, where Orwell encounters a nightmare-world of purges, when idealistic men who fought bravely for the Republican cause are arrested and imprisoned for the political affiliations of their military units.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the second narrative of HtC analyzes the contending, but long-dead, politics of PSUC, POUM, FAI, CNT, UGT, and so on. In this case, the considerate Orwell concentrates his analysis in two long chapters (five and eleven). And, he advises readers without interest in the war's labyrinth politics to skip this material, which can be done without diminishing the power of Orwell's story. But in general, what he conveys about this war's politics appears near the start of Chapter 5: \\"As a militiaman one was a soldier against Franco, but one was also a pawn in an enormous struggle that was being fought between two political theories.\\"<br /><br />HtC also works well as a historical document. On page 2, Orwell makes an observation that initially struck me as unpersuasive:  \\"I had come to Spain with some notion of writing newspaper articles, but I had joined the militia almost immediately, because at that time and in that atmosphere it seemed the only conceivable thing to do.\\" But thereafter, Orwell communicates the mighty appeal of the Republican cause--its transformation of Spain from a feudal to an egalitarian society--as well as the desire of its adherents to finally limit the spread of relentless Fascism.<br /><br />And a last thought: Three cheers for Georges Kopp!ghty appeal of the Republican cause--its transformation of Spain from a feudal to an egalitarian society--as well as the desire of its adherents to finally limit the spread of relentless Fascism.     And a last thought: Three cheers for Georges Kopp!

B001IAOEXU|5.0|This product is the answer to the only real gripe abut the PS3's Dual Shock 3 controller.  The R2 and L2 buttons were redesigned and made like triggers that push in at an angle.  The problem is that they either became uncomfortable for long extended \\"hold the button down\\" type presses, or for some, because of the angle, had their fingers slip off of them.  Enter the RealTriggers.  A simple snap on affair, they attach to your DS3's shoulder buttons and instantly make them much more pleasant to use, especially in racing games where you have to hold the trigger for acceleration. They match the original Sony triggers in texture and look, and without close examination, no one would think they were not original.  A simple, cheap, and effective product.  a 5 out of 5 no question.

B0011NVC98|4.0|With monsters, crossbreeding with dragons and shape shifting this<br />movie plays out more like a fantasy than the elder epic classic poem.<br />The Vikings that the poem is about are the same who raided the English coast and set up kingdoms there ( called Dane law).<br />So this history is one of legend of a hero who overcame some sort of monster<br />who ate men. That the poem was written down after about 300 years<br />makes it contemporary to the Saxon invasion of England that King Arthur<br />was involved with ( another legend).<br />I liked the movie: it has been turned into a fun<br />story of promises and revenge between men and dragons.
B0018M6J90|5.0|I rented Miss Pettigrew from Netflix on a whim, watched it three times, and went to Amazon to purchase before I was willing to give it up.  Frances McDormand, as would-be nanny Guinevere Pettigrew, and Amy Adams, as American actress Delysia LaFosse, are utterly charming in their interaction. McDormand gives a touching performance as the dour Miss Pettigrew who is drawn willy-nilly into Delysia's dizzying and improper life. Adams' bubbly effervescence accommodates moments of fear, self-awareness and pathos as Delysia reveals her vulnerability.  Ciaran Hinds also shines as a sock expert turned lingerie designer who reveals unexpected depth.  If you enjoy romantic comedy, especially with a little real character depth and a soupcon of historical context, you must see this movie!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I refused reading this book for so long and would (politely) walk away when anyone started their glowing reports of this read.  Saw it in the bookstore and decided to succumb to the book with the very odd title...and I am so glad I did.  Being carried away to an island with characters, warmth and charm...a bit of romance did not hurt, either.  In some ways this book reminds me of Jan Karon's novels about Father Tim and Mitford, North Carolina - complete with characters and caring souls.  This is a feel good book and now I will read something heavy and dark to counter the non unbearable lightness of being...

0553214632|5.0|The yellow-covered reprint version done Nov 2008 at 495 pages is much easier on the eyes, blacker ink and bigger type.  The one they sent me was from June 1999 at 416 pages and is smaller type and lighter harder-to-read ink.  But the best I found, especially with this book, is librivox (public domain audiobook), because Darwin uses rather looong run-on sentences.

But they still have energy, and their performances are spot-on amazing like you'd expect.  The Blu-Ray quality makes the video jump off the screen - beautiful to behold.  The Extras you get with this blu ray are lots of fun, too.  If for no other reason, than just to see Neal smile and be goofy (not as much as Alex and Geddy, but goofy nonetheless.)  Well worth the price.  I'll watch this again and again.

0061139378|5.0|Young Coraline's family has recently moved into a new house and she is just starting to explore the house and getting to know her neighbors, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and the old man who lives upstairs with his pet mice. She hasn't met any other children in the area yet so she has plenty of time to explore the house. But she gets more than she expected when she steps through a mysterious door in the house and finds another house almost exactly like hers and another mother and another father who look just like her parents. But they really aren't like her parents at all and soon Coraline is in a fight to return to her ordinary life and her ordinary parents.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is Neil Gaiman's delightfully quirky book that is aimed at readers ages eight and up but can be enjoyed by readers of all ages. While Gaiman creates a bizarre alternate world once Coraline goes through the door, the real world she lives in is a bit odd as well. Her parents basically ignore her, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible are obsessed with their dogs and the man upstairs is obsessed with his mice. Once she is through the door, Gaiman creates a world that seems familiar to Coraline but gets creepier the longer she stays there. Gaiman does a great job of creating the parallel world (I love what he does with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and the talking cat). Coraline (not Caroline - nice touch) is a strong heroine who grows stronger throughout the course of the book as she has to save several people, including herself from a horrible fate. The world Gaiman creates is deliciously creepy but may be a bit too scary for younger readers.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is a wonderfully dark book for readers of all ages.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This video is simple, straightforward, yet intense. As someone who is fairly out of shape, it has taken me a couple of weeks to do the video straight through with weights without stopping. I appreciate the fact that there is no fancy choreography or crazy movements; just good old-fashioned jumping jacks, crunches and strength moves, among other things.  Jillian is a little annoying with her military-style \\"fight for it!\\" motivational yelling, but it was bearable.     Though the video is short, you will defintley feel like you've worked hard due to the constant circuit-movement. I am still on Level 1, but look forward to going up to Level 2 soon. I recommend this video to anyone who is short on time but wants a complete, heart-pumping workout.
0805080120|5.0|This is the best of several books I have read on how languages are derived.  The expertise of the writer in many languages allowed him to give excellent examples of the development and degradation of languages during their life spans, and clearly explained many of the interesting and esoteric characteristics of languages, case endings and the double negative in French being two of the more eye-opening discussions.
B000UJ48U4|4.0|Mispublicized as an especially steamy thriller by its studio, and sensationalized by the presence of its then married stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Stanley Kubrick's last film enjoyed the same controversy that had dogged all his releases since the early 1960s. Based on Arthur Schnitzler's fin-de-siecle \\"Traumnovelle,\\" EYES WIDE SHUT is a languid and dreamlike puzzle picture about a married wealthy doctor who, wounded by his wife's thoughts of infidelity, explores sexually straying from her and finds himself caught up in a nightmare of conspiracy and surveillance. Whether or not Cruise's Dr. Bill Harford is awake or dreaming through most of the film is somewhat up for interpretation: he lives in an unreal Manhattan created almost entirely on the soundstages of London's Pinewood Studios (Kubrick was too afraid of flying to shoot on location), and in the conspiracy he uncovers, most of the upsetting women he encounters are tall redhaired amazons who all seem doubles of his own wife. As with all of Kubrick's films, EYES WIDE SHUT is primarily about the de-humanizing cruelty of the world to the film's protagonists. The murderous wealthy and powerful cabal Bill uncovers (which practices masked hierogamous sex rituals in a Long Island mansion) really is simply a dream figuration for the mortality that dogs him, despite his handsomeness, wealth, and position; Bill's final talk with his wife Alice in a toy store during Christmas shopping suggests that sex is all that's left to them to keep the Grim Reaper at bay.     The film is much more complex than my little summary can suggest, and since its densely allusive (as all Kubrick films are) it has acquired a substantial cult reputation. It's not one of his best films, but it's still quite good. Its weakest sequences are at the beginning, with a silver-haired Hungarian count who makes silly passes at Kidman's Alice at a holiday ball, and the much-talked about orgy that disappointed so many looking for something sexy (andinstead purposefully shows ritualized sex acts drained of any eros whatsoever). Kidman surprised critics and audiences with her performance in this film, and she is genuinely quite exciting in all her scenes except for the misjudged drunk sequence at the ball, and Sydney Pollack as the rich Ziegler may be even better than she is, particularly in the scene close to the end of the film in his billiards room. As he did so often in the late 90s and the very early years of the 21st century, Tom Cruise seems cast in order for the smug fratboy type he played in the 80s to be shown to be broken and emasculated; he moves well and sometimes has genuinely fine instincts, but is not quite up to convincingly conveying anguish. Though its stiltedness is intentional, the dialogue by Fredric Raphael is the weakest part of the film.

But, take heart these little differences are what make this movie stand apart from it's remake counter part. Though the plot is virtually the same, The deaths  are different. Lets face it good deaths and plot twists are what  people go to see movies like this for. View this movie if you wish to know how Wes Craven, and Sean S. Cunningham became the horror icons they are today. You will be pleased with what you find if horror and gore are what you seek. Oh and be for warned it's not for the casual horror fan, or anybody that has a weak stomach. With that being said happy viewing horror fans.

B000001GK0|3.0|For all those who are not concious about the multiple efforts made by W.F in order to avoid Mr. K was the main chief of the BPO, I must tell the triumph was just partial because of the fact his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e (the unforgettable and talented Hungarian conductor, Ferenc Fricsay would pass away just nine years after, on February 1963). This unexpected and irreparable loss, would leave the road free to Mr. K, who assumed the direction until his death in 1989 with the results you and me are aware.<br /><br />Christian Zimmermann is one of the last exponents of a musical tradition that knew about the egregious importance of combining technique and personal expression at the moment to play any single piece by insignificant it may be.<br /><br />But this recording certainly is far to become a worthy musical feat. Mr. K. did possible the apparently impossible: to make this concert sounded unbearably bored and tedious. I guess Mr. K was not convinced at all about the way this sublime piano concert must be conducted. Since the first bars, you may feel how heavy the orchestral mass sounds. In honor to the truth, this recording may be among the most revealing examples of what an uninspired conductor is capable to make with such emblematic material.<br /><br />The Schumann lacks of vitality and conviction too. I'm sorry for Zimmermann who thanks his admirable gifts could have selected other conductor to undertake these jewels of the Romantic tradition to a most secure and rewarding port.<br /><br />Do you want the desert island choice for both concerts? Grieg: three memorable performances. Lipatti, Lupu and Rubinstein. In what Schumann concerns: Ivan Moravec and Neumann, Samson Francois and Sviatoslav Richter.

B001CD6FKI|5.0|In spite of being a big fan of the cartoon, I skipped this movie in theatres due to so many bad reviews.  I figured just another great childhood memory destroyed in pursuit of the mighty dollar.  I was mistaken.  The movie strives and achieves preservation of so many great elements from the original series.  That being said, it is easy to understand why so many did not enjoy Speed Racer on the big screen.  Its frantic pace and blazing effects would be overwhelming in a theatre (much better suited to a smaller screen). I think the biggest flaw could have easily been solved in editing.  The first fifteen minutes are very, very difficult to follow with too many confusing flashbacks. It left me feeling irritated that they didn't take time to ease us into the story.    Once the movie settles down, it really shines.  Seamless blending of live characters with animated scenery.  Mary Poppins would be amazing with these effects.  Well-cast, even Spridle and Chim Chim add to the fun.  The portrayal of the villians matches the cartoon and the sound of the Mach 5 jumping made me feel 10 years old again.  A great job re-creating the series!!! Its a shame their effort was under-appreciated.

B00005JLWN|3.0|I have been told that the movie, Equilibrium is very similar to the box office hit, The Matrix. After watching Equilibrium I can say that it cannot even compare to The Matrix. There are some similarities but I would say for sure Equilibrium does not come anywhere close to The Matrix. My spedific thoughts about Equilibrium are mixed. I thought the movie was at times a little too cheesy for me, but at other points I thought the movie had some great action scenes. The actions scenes were pretty unrealistic but then again movies tend to be way more entertaining if they are completely unrealistic. People like to watch movies that show events that clearly could never happen. The movie kept my attention and thats all it needed to do in order for me to not bash it. My one complaint though is the ending. I think the ending could have been a lot better. I felt as if I was left hanging and wanted to know some of what happened after he basically destroyed everyone/everything bad.

0307269981|4.0|I found this book to be a solid sequel to [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]], in fact, I may have liked it ever better than the first.<br /><br />In this book we learn more about Salander.  Skillfully exposed throughout the course of the novel, bits and pieces of her background appear until by the end a full picture has emerged.  Some statisfying, some not so satisfying.  A couple points easily guessed early on.<br /><br />She's a fascinating character, and the parts about her were my favorite in the book, (even the parts that were seemingly plot irrelevant and never resolved).  She's a smart, strong, flawed underdog, and you can't help rooting for her.<br /><br />This book tackles a lot of topics.  Sex trade, the media, police corruption, authority abuse, on and on.  I like it because it keeps it interesting, but sometimes it was all over the board.  Especially interesting to me is learning more about Swedish culture throughout the course of the book.<br /><br />What's best about the book is the pace.  It kept me captivated throughout the 569 pages (in my copy), and I couldn't go to bed until I finished.  It's a well-done thriller.<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't find that you needed to have read The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo first, but certainly that would be preferable.<br /><br />Looking forward to the 3rd, and sad that it will be the last.  This is a really interesting series.

B001P3SA94|1.0|What happened to the Chess Brothers?  Was it just Leonard Chess?  NO it was not.  Can't stand when right from the start they get it wrong.  At least mention the guy.  And speaking of the guy - what happened to Buddy Guy and Bo Diddley?  I guess Phil Chess took care of them. I would have liked to see some complete performances, especially of Muddy Waters. There are too many musicians represented here that deserve a movie of their own. How can so many movies be made this way.  They know the facts, but refuse to make it right.  What bothers me is that someone makes a conscious effort to do so.          I like the music, but I'm not grading the music, I'm grading the storyline - 1 star.
0307455378|3.0|1. If you liked (or loved like I did) La Sombra del Viento, you will somehow be dissapointed with this book.    2. If you haven't read La Sombra, you would like to purchase that one instead, unless you want to go from worst to best.    3. I have to disagree with those that say that suddenly the book had a bad ending in the last 20 to 40 pages. It didn't went from great book to regular book in the end. It was all throughout the book. As someone said, there is a lack of sympathy for any of the chacacters.     4. There's obviously a lack of closure on the characters and storylines. There's an attempt to do so, but is done lousily. The \\"explanations\\" didn't really matched up. Even the \\"bridge\\" with the beginning of La Sombra del Viento is bad, and it even takes away from the latter book.    5. That said, the book keeps you interested and you can't put it down. That's why I named my review Good Read, not so good book (for what it might mean). Its like a good-flavored wine with a bad aftertaste. You can't say is a good wine. I think this will hold up even if you haven't read La Sombra. But if you have, you just can't help but compare.
B001NOMNZW|5.0|Bought it for my daughter, who loves it.  It's great to have the 3 copies - a great value!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album rules! You must listen at least 4 times to appreciate this album as someone previously mentioned. I alternated between these 2 CD's for over 2 years constantly. Amazing! Awesome! Highly recomended.
B000001GF9|5.0|This sweeping account of the C Minor Mass was the first CD I ever owned of the piece. Initially I was not satisfied but it grew on me. Every other version I've auditioned over the years, whether on modern or period instruments has met with my disapproval in one regard or another. Not even Karajan, ( my favorite conductor ), matches Bernstein here. There is a forthright passion throughout and due reverence. It sounds like a spiritual experience, not a jog through the park with your ipod. For that, go to Gardiner.    Arleen Auger's ethereal soprano is the star here among the soloists. I haven't heard a more beautiful rendition of the opening movement's solo yet. All the big moments in the piece come off with striking authority and the organ is well placed, prominent but not intrusive. With Karajan on his Gold CD, the organ is buried behind the orchestra and chorus.    Looks like someone posted the Kyrie Eleison video as part of their review. This live performance is available on DVD from which that clip springs. It's filmed in a cathedral and has a sense of occasion. I prefer the CD myself. Close your eyes and be lifted to the heavens by pure sound...
1416550542|3.0|Standing alone on the dock in Queensland, Australia, all others from the voyage off to families and homes, a four year old girl waits for someone to come.  Clutching her suitcase near, she waits and is never claimed.  Finally, the dock master, Hugh and his wife take her in and call her Nell.  Searching for her family brings no answers, only a faint memory of hitting her head and a woman called \\"the Authoress\\".  It isn't until her 21st birthday that Nell is told of how she came to live with the couple.  Shattered, she sets out to find her identity.  She travels to England and to the Mountrachet family home, Blackhurst Manor.  She purchases a small cottage on the property and prepares to delve into the family secrets and their ties to her when family obligations force her to focus on the present and to let the past lie.  Not until years later, Nell's granddaughter is grieving over her grandmother's death and decides to untangle the years of mystery and deceit.<br />  I haven't read The House at Riverton, Morton's other book (which my friends raved about).  I am told it follows a similar structure.  I was pretty much overwhelmed by the sheer volume and following so many storylines that I had a hard time maintaining interest.  The writing is beautiful and dense, almost overripe.  The male characters are almost an afterthought and seem to be deliberately repellant.  The storylines border on the melodramatic and meander on....too much to wade through for my tastes.
0307277887|5.0|Oh! I REALLY enjoyed this book! My fiance and I just finished watching the first season of the television show on Showtime, and I was so excited to learn that it was a book first. It had so much of the cadence of the show - or, rather, I suppose it should be the other way around, but since I saw the show first, Dexter's inner narrative sounds like Michael C. Hall's voice to me... Anyways, the narrative presence is so strong... all in all making this a truly excellent book. And the differences between the TV show and the book were pretty substantial! Deborah's role in the end... LaGuerta's future... I just feel like I am reading the real story and the TV show is some sort of alternate Dexter... So while both are quite enjoyable, while waiting to see the second season I am relieved to have the second novel already waiting on my shelves! I am just so VERY curious as to where the series goes next in both formats!! Two more books of Darling Dexter - how fun!!<br /><br />And like the show, the book series stands up to the test of being fun to enjoy again! It's a darkly comedic novel with fast pacing and is a lot of fun to read - multiple times!
0440237688|5.0|I just finished this book for my upcoming book club.  I enjoyed the way the book flowed, and the rather insightful concepts which were introduced in a very easy to understand format.  I have to agree with another reviewer who admonishes people who would ban this book.  It almost sends chills down my spine to realize that the future could actually become the lives that are portrayed in the book. I believe that people/ and/or groups that find offense to this read  are just proving to me that what is portrayed by the author could actually happen in the future.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|If you love Chihuahuas, this a very nice movie to watch.  My daughter and I loved it.
0316789704|5.0|I love this book because we can make pictures from it together, or it is simple enough that my kids (9 and 6) can do it by themselves, and not get frustrated.  They are always fo thrilled when they can use an \\"instruction\\" type book like this, and not have to come running to me for help.  I love all of Emberley's books!
B0001WTUH6|4.0|Movies are always a good choice as a gift, and this happened to be on my stepdad's list of things he wanted. He really liked the movie, it was in great condition, but I have yet to watch it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|this is a good comedy my husband loved thid when he was on his computer one day then i saw this on amazon and bought it for him, he thought it was great he laughs the whole time
B0007OCG4W|4.0|I think this was a wonderful purchase.  I have not watched this DVD as yet but the price and shipping were great.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|The best part of this movie? The accessories! I loved watching the girls and all their gear get into some trouble and have some fun and some sex. I have to admit that I was beginning to get sick of Big during the last season, but he worked well in the movie. The man just can't make up his mind! Poor Carrie!!! But I am glad I watched it and my mouth just watered at all the luxury goods. Yum! A recommend. If you haven't seen the series yet, it's a good bet, too---[[ASIN:B0011UBDTK Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)]].
1565117700|5.0|This is a great classic.  I loved hearing Gary Sinise narrate the book he does an excellent job.  This has always been one of my favorite books and this is the best way to \\"read\\" it.  I listened to it on my way into work and my way home.
055358894X|4.0|It took a while for the book to kick into high gear, but when it did, it was unstoppable!!  Locke, his band of merry men, the Grey King, the Bondsmage, the Don Corelone type guy...all very engaging and entertaining.  I think i was expecting a bit more \\"fantasy\\", but that's a minor nitpick.  It also slowed down during parts, but there were so many really cool moments that it was OK.  All in all, I'm looking forward to learning more about Locke and Jean, especially the love of Locke's life that is so often mentioned in Book 1 as an obvious tease for Book 2 :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|Loved it, loved it and loved it! Let me tell you I hate working out. Still hate working out and I may always hate working out but the one thing I realized with me needing to lose about 90lbs is that with correct eating I have to work out as well. I used to work out 3xtimes per week doing low impact aerobics and I saw a difference in my body. However, when I started doing Jillian's workouts, man she kicked my butt! Just the warm up makes your heart race and your body sweat. By the end it I am laying on the floor, soaked with sweat but really feeling good. I have knee problems. Not because I hurt my knee but because my weight is causing my knees to ache and grind. Even though I hate jumping, but I still do it. If a 400lb person can jump and not knock themselves out then I can do it. Some people say this is for more advanced people. No, its for a beginner as well. She gives you the beginner and modified version and you can do it until you have lost more weight or have the strength to do the modified version. So, buy this DVD, you will not be sorry and you WILL see results! Good luck! I will check back in a few weeks and let you guys know how much additional weight I have lost! Go Jillian and thank you for bringing basics back!
0756405890|4.0|Let me get the negatives out of the way - Denna really irked me.  I don't want to post any spoilers, so I'll just say the \\"relationship\\" was way too ambiguous for me and I think it would have had a deeper meaning if it had been taken to the next level.  Also, there were a number of pages were nothing really happened, and I found myself quickly reading...I would have liked a bit more action. BUT, I can't wait to see what happens in Book 2!!  The mysterious Chandrian alone could fill an entire novel and I'd be hooked!  Very cool and creepy group...Kvothe and his time spent in Tarbean was great.  Bast is a very cool character...The University - library, Master Elodin, the \\"naming of the wind\\" scene, and all the other teachers and students - great stuff!!!  Highly recommended...but get ready for a LOT of reading :)
B00005JLWN|3.0|I didn't think this movie was that bad. It was very similar to the book, 1984. They both had main characters who rebelled against the acceptable way of life. They both also had a love story intertwined into their plot. In both, loving someone was against the rules. And eventually they were both caught in the action. I liked the setting of the movie because it made the movie more interesting. It also made the movie more suspenseful. On the other hand, I didn't think that the acting was very good. It just looked too fake. For instance, at the end of the movie, it looked like he was just waving his arms around and everyone was falling over and dying. The fighting just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. But other than that, I thought everything else was pretty interesting.
B001HN69AE|4.0|I know there are legions of DB fans and i am also 100% that many of them didnt see this film. If they had, it wouldnt have debuted at the 8th place in the box office with four million during its opening weekend. Needless to say, this is not a bad movie. Its not great, but it could have been way better. The movie also felt very fast paced. I would have liked to see a two hour film, but that just isnt happening.<br /><br />Justin Chatwin has a certain boyish charm about himself and i  think he did a good job as a teenage Goku. He even looked like Goku from certain angles. If you see season three of DBZ when Goku fights Frieza, there are certain shots where Goku has many similarities to Justin.<br /><br />I would have liked to see much more of the DBZ universe storyline incoporated into the film, but being that we are in the US and its 2009, its hard for asian themes to be weaved into american cinema without appearing corny. Check this film out because its not that bad.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I don't know what the subtitles are supposed to be, but I have no issues with the ones on my Blu-Ray copy.  This is a great film, and at the current price of under $20 its a steal. If you like great stories and aren't put off by subtitles, buy this movie.<br /><br />In fact, my biggest advice would be to know as little about the story as possible before you watch it.  So, I'm not going to ruin anything by discussing the plot.  Suffice it to say that its an amazing story, fantastic actors (better than most three times their age), great themes, great hidden under themes, great cinematography, great movie.<br /><br />Just buy it already!!!
1416550534|4.0|Have yet to read this book but enjoyed her other book.  Amaqzon was very quick at sending my book.  Thank you
B001MYIXAC|4.0|First, I'll address the poor subtitles. Yes, the matching of the subtitles and english language are so far from accurate that I just turned them off and watched it with the english language track only.<br />I bought this based off the review on the front of the DVD and I guess it's pretty right. It IS \\"A vampire tale like no other. Mesmerizing\\". This can be good OR bad. I don't feel it was a bad movie other than the fact that many things characters did in the movie were definately NOT what anyone would do in a real life situation. It was like they made the movie and never went back to proof/edit it for continuity.<br />Having said that, overall it was a good movie. It WAS original. It was dark, sad and makes you really feel for the characters. You really feel bad because of what Oskar is going through and the way they never quite let you see Eli doing the horrible things she must do. I feel that because they didn't try to CG her being \\"superhuman\\" that it left room for the viewer to use their imagination a bit.<br />Some people are jumping on the kiddie porn issue. If I remember right, even though I felt that seeing the one part of Eli's (12 yrs old) body was not neccessary, I think the camera cuts from the body part to the girls face so fast that it most likely wasn't actually her. It was an uneccessary scene that could have been done differently to get the same effect and make everyone happy. Even if it was faked, it was not worth the hassle it is causing and should not have been shown.<br />On a good note, scenes such as their first meeting (dialogue), the final pool scene, and especially the scene where she tells Oskar, \\"You must invite me in.\\" and what happens to her when she comes in anyway, were really spellbinding. I won't say what happens but you will have to watch to find out.<br />I will still tell people to see it. It reminds me of Daywatch and 30 days of night...with kids but no major special effects. The effects they did do, were really well done.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|Timbaland's style and Cornell's style just don't mesh and this album is proof.  It is awful.  The hidden bluesy track is the only one worthwhile on the entire album.  Only about 2 other songs are even tolerable.  Cornell's great vocal range, song writing, and grit is reduced to dull (almost spoken) vocals, inane lyrics, and a poor use of his talent.  It is not acceptable as a hip-hop or R&B album either.  Buy Cornell's Euphoria Morning if you don't already have it instead of this trash.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|I don't know what the heck this movie is about. It plays with bending time and reality. It's kinetic...too much so. It comes across as chaotic rather than thought provoking. It's set in NY but to me it seemed like Dickens' London which was disorienting. Death seems to be the subject and the cause of death is suicide. Very grim. Needlessly grim in my opinion and what was the obsession with McGregor wearing white socks with his pants short enough to see them? Were they trying to say he was attempting to out run death?
0307269191|3.0|As an avid reader and runner, I had a hard time getting into this book. While I enjoyed parts of it, I found it tough to focus during much of it.
B000ECX0QU|4.0|As so many people are I'm a Hitchcock fan.  For some reason I've never seen this movie before.  What a treat to happen upon an old friend in new clothes!  This movie is based on Leon Uris' Cold War/Bay of Pigs novel of the same name.  Agents and double agents, people changing allegiances, no way to tell who's telling the truth or even why they're saying and doing things.  The photography (as is almost always true with Hitchcock) is startling.  He does an omniscient thing by photographing from above so often interspersed with his signature WAY too close up shots.  I was most struck by the actor who played Deveraux.  I haven't read Uris' book so I'm not sure what his intent was but there doesn't seem to be any one character who you feel completely sympathetic with so it was hard to feel fully `present'.  Not one of Hitchcock's best movie but hey, it's still Hitchcock.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|By far the best movie I have seen in a long time.  The acting is outstanding.  That is what makes this movie so good.  Hoffman, Streep, and Adams are so good that you don't even think that this is a movie.  What happens is that Streep and Adams are nuns who begin to have suspicions that Hoffman the priest is doing improper things with one of the children in the church.  These suspicions and doubts lead to a whirlwind of uncovering the truths and accusations.  The acting is so superb that you really feel that these people are really nuns and priests.  I'm not going to give the movie away, but the word doubt for the name of the movie is perfect!  I definitely recommend buying this movie.  I pre-ordered it and I was very satisfied with this movie.
B00154GEFU|5.0|In early 1984, after months of internal struggles, guitar superstar Steve Howe was asked to leave the group. With Steve's departure, the band lost it's focus and went totally pop, losing a great deal of it's audience as well.<br />The next few years saw a myriad of changes in the band's personnel and sound. Though much of it was interesting, it still wasn't the original band.<br />In 2006, the original quartet reformed for 2 years of tours, and an outstanding live CD & DVD.<br />What the fans really wanted was a new studio recording just to show that the group still had it.<br />In the spring of 2008 - 25 years after the original group's last release, \\"ALPHA\\" - the original Asia rose from the ashes with th appropriately titled \\"PHOENIX\\".<br /><br />  The Tracks:<br /><br />The album sounds like vintage 1980's Asia, more than likely how a 3rd album would have sounded back then.<br />John Wetton's solo composition \\"Nothing's Forever\\" is punctuated by Geoff Downes' trademark brass stabs and layered strings on keyboards, while Steve Howe switches from acoustic to steel guitars with ease. John's layered vocals tell us plainly to \\"live for the future\\".<br /><br />\\"Heroine\\" is a classic power ballad. Simple, emotional & to the point.<br /><br />\\"Sleeping Giant\\"/\\"No Way Back\\" starts out with Geoff's keyboards laying out a foundation typical of 1990's Asia output, while Steve adds jazzy electric guitar and Coral electric sitar which are reminiscent of his work with Yes. The instrumental opening segues into the vocal portion, which features John's strong voice and wah-wah bass. Following the vocal section, the intro reprises to a conclusion.<br /><br />\\"Alibis\\" is a leftover song from the aborted 1984 sessions.<br />Credited to all four members, first part of the song is classic Wetton/Downes song writing. Hooks galore, multi-tracked harmonies, and excellent solo from Geoff & Steve are all Asia trademark arrangements. The 2nd half of the song is obviously the Steve Howe/Carl Palmer contribution. A 4-chord vamp typical of Steve's solo output with Carl's assorted percussion sets the backdrop for Steve's jazz/rock guitar solo. Very 1982.<br /><br />\\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" is \\"Don't Cry\\" revisited.<br /><br />\\"I Will Remember You\\" is a haunting ballad in the Wetton tradition, that tugs at the heart strings.<br /><br />The album's progressive piece is a 3-part epic.<br />\\"Parallel Worlds\\" features one of John's best ever vocals and Steve's tasty electric 12-string.<br />\\"Vortex\\" is segued into by Geoff's piano & Steve's guitar, with a staccato figure that sets the tone for Carl Palmer's supreme moment on the album. Double bass drums combine with rapid fire snares and tom toms.<br />\\"Deya\\" is the calm after the storm, a quiet nylon string and steel mood piece.<br /><br />The track least at home on this collection is \\"Orchard of Mines\\", the one non-group composition they ever recorded. It's the one weak link on the album.<br /><br />Steve contributed two solo compositions to the album.<br />The first \\"Wish I'd Known All Along\\" is the the type of song that Yes would have recorded, and the presence of Steve on harmony vocals, His high speed guitar breaks & Geoff's 'Yes-type' keyboards, reminds us where these guys came from.<br />\\"Over & Over\\" is a 1984 leftover that other than John's vocal is Steve all the way.<br /><br />The albums closer \\" An Extraordinary Life\\" is a wonderfully optimistic feel-good song that's one of the group's very best.<br /><br />My favorite track, however, is the opener, \\"Never Again\\".<br />Steve's Gibson ES Artist is showcased from the distortion-soaked opening riff, to the Fenderesque bridge tone, to the bluesy/jazzy end solo.<br />Geoff's textures are just right.<br />Carl's speedy high hat and rounds on the toms are rock solid.<br />John's vocal strong and proud as he vows 'never again' to wish evil on another.<br />A magical performance; the best since the first albun.<br /><br />Asia rose from the ashes, and the dragonmet the phoenix. A must-have for Asia fans.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|\\"Australia\\" is a most enjoyable movie.  So what if it's derivative and familiar, as many critics have complained?  This is a story of a point in Australia's history, and Baz Luhrmann has woven a masterful tale bringing together cutthroat cattle barons, the disgraceful treatment of the Aboriginal people and the mysteries of their culture, the Japanese attack on Darwin, a sly play on \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" and the delicious romance of two gorgeous people.  The outback landscape is powerfully filmed--I don't even mind the obvious CGI, and the musical score works beautifully....I could go on.  I bought this dvd after having seen it once and wanted it for future viewing.
B000V6BE6C|1.0|I found the album, much like their others,to be very dissappointing and lacking substance. The fret board hijinks can be entertaing but are often ruined by lame meldoic \\"swedish-esque\\" riffs that make me want to jam a pencil into my ear drum. I think they are fun to see live but to sit down and listen to it's like nails on a chalk board. If you like the more meldoic approaches check out Machine HEad's \\"The Blackening\\" or the past couple disc from  The Haunted. But don't waste your time with this commercialized, over produced garbage, you might as well be listening to britney spears.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|This is a very well made movie. The animation is excellent and the picture quality on this Blu-ray disc was fantastic. I really enjoyed seeing all the detail.
B001PPF12G|5.0|Some time in 1995, I walked into a music store and heard The Bends, Radiohead's second album, on the store's sound system.  I purchased it immediately.  The album was a huge breakthrough for Radiohead and it was, in this reviewer's opinion, along with the band's third album, OK Computer, one of the two best albums of the 1990s.<br /><br />As most of those considering this box set already know, the music on The Bends is nothing short of amazing.  It is beautiful and rocking guitar (often acoustic) based music (unlike many later Radiohead efforts), with ethereal and thought provoking vocals, colorful textures, and tasteful guitar leads.  Thom Yorke (vocals) and Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar) really shine.  It is a great, great album.<br /><br />So what about this box set?  Well, as with the other two recent re-releases of Radiohead's first three albums by the band's now former record company, it contains two audio CDs, one of the original album and one of ep tracks and/or B-sides and \\"live\\" tracks (here, from BBC Radio One), and one DVD containing videos and \\"live\\" tracks (here concert, studio and television footage).  There are also less expensive sets just containing the two audio CDs.<br /><br />About the sound quality.  There has been some griping that the album has not been remastered.  Keeping in mind that the album was first made for CD, and not all remastering is an improvement, it seems to me that the sound on these CDs -- although I found this more obvious on the Pablo Honey and OK Computer discs -- sounds better than I recall the original discs sounding.  The 2CD/1DVD box sets are manufactured in the EU -- most likely in the UK --and seem to be excellent pressings.  I do not know if the same is the case with the 2CD sets, but given the delay in the release of the box sets, I suspect that the 2CD sets are likely domestic.<br /><br />As great as the first CD (containing The Bends album) is, it is remarkable how fine the second CD is.  First, it contains all ofthe songs (other than the title track, which appears on the first CD) of the \\"My Iron Lung\\" ep, which was released in 1994, the year before the Bends was released (and following the Pablo Honey album).  The second disc also contains B-sides from the singles released from The Bends album, and these include some of the band's finest B-sides, some really great tunes.  Lastly, it includes four live songs from a 1994 BBC Radio One session.  While Radiohead fans are likely to have many, or most, of the songs included on this second disc, it is nice to have them all together, and, for those who haven't acquired them already, at a much lower cost than purchasing all of the [import] singles.  In response to the reviewer who complained that the same songs are available on-line for 99 cents each, but sorry, the sound quality here is superior to MP3 format.<br /><br />The third disc is a DVD containing the videos from the album (amazing how young the band members look), concert footage from a 1994 London show (the same show featured on the Pablo Honey DVD) and live footage taken in the studio and from British television.  While the video could have been better (the footage does not run consecutively for one thing) it is great to see the band rock out on the tunes, and the sound and video quality is very good.  I'm certain that most of this footage can be found on-line, so it is up to the individual as to whether to pony up the extra dough for the box set.  Like I said, however, the box set is an import containing some nice pressings of the audio CDs.<br /><br />Lastly, about the record company cashing in, and that the band is not behind this.  Yes, that may be true.  But was the band behind the release of all those outrageously expensive import singles/B-sides, that should have been released, as they have been here, on a single CD?  The nut of it is, the music is excellent (same of Radiohead's very best), and at the time of the writing of this review, Amazon is selling this thing at a steep discount from the release price (I'm waiting for a refund).  Highly recommended.
B0002OOUP0|3.0|The Rolling Stones have plenty of collections out there, mostly focusing on their early (1964-1970) days. That is thanks to their old label ABCKO, who keep milking the Rolling Stones name with releases like 'Hot Rocks 1964-1971,' 'Singles Collection: The London Years,' and 'Big Hits!,' which was a compilation released back in the '60s, admittedly.     'Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones 71-93' has it's moments, and it has the hits, but not much else. A more appropriate title would be 'Greatest Hits 1971-1993.'     However, what is here is great. 'Brown Sugar,' 'Undercover of the Night' (you hate to say you love it, but you do), 'Wild Horses' and one of my personal favorites, the ballad 'Angie.' So there is some great material here, and it again, it has the hits. So therefore, it gets three stars.    Why not five, you may ask? Well, here's the thing. What I would like to see is a Stones' Virgin era (1971-present) compilation that combines hits and perhaps some album tracks, which are recordings that deserved to be, but for some reason never were, hits.     Where are 'Some Girls,' from the 1978 album by the same name, 'She Was Hot,' from 1983's 'Undercover of the Night,' 'Dancing with Mr. D,' one of my personal favorites, from 1973's 'Goats Head Soup,' and perhaps another album classic like 'Black Limousine' from 1981's 'Tattoo You'?     Now granted, the chances are casual Stones fans that only have heard the hits have not heard those tracks before. That is actually quite a shame, as they are classic Stones tracks that all easily could have been and should have been hits.    Overall, if you are a casual Stones fan who only wants the songs they hear on the radio every day, buy 'Jump Back.' You'll be satisfied and you'll get the radio hits. Otherwise, stick with 'Forty Licks' for now. That is the most comprehensive Stones collection on the market.    If you are real Stones fan like myself, all we can do is hope that eventually the Stones will release a collectionfull of album tracks perhaps blended in with some hits. 'Sucking in the Seventies' is the closest thing to that type of compilation, which is a little scary.     Recommended for the casual Stones fan, but otherwise, stick to 'Forty Licks' and 'Sucking in the Seventies.'
B000P12LWY|5.0|King Henry VIII was so hot! I and my neighbor who is from Bristol, England have enjoyed watching every one of these episodes multiple times. The casting is amazing, the costuming is stunning and makes watching this series worth it in itself.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This flick has moved to the top of my favorite all-time movie comic book hero list.  Awesome acting, special effects, soundtrack.  Good story and everything looks real, not cgi.  Amazing!
B001EO748M|5.0|is just as good. Even though you know what will ultimately happen to Anne, this series manages to keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense nonetheless. I'll miss poor Anne in the third year.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|This version smokes the first one in every way.  Special effects are off the chart, everything looks real.
0312360266|2.0|Sadly disappointed with this book. After just finishing the Twilight series, I was hoping for something at least a bit similar. Not this book. The constant digs and preaching (on sex, drugs, etc) in an effort to sound more \\"teen-like\\" was quite annoying. And did the author do research on witchcraft and forget that she was suppose to be writing a vampire book!!
079073639X|3.0|I don't know. I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it. The acting was decent, but not top-rate (Hoffman seemed miscast, but Schreiber had it down almost perfectly). The special effects looked realistic and charming to look at. The music had that proper \\"deep sea\\" feel; I enjoyed listening to it while watching the movie. But the biggest problem I had with the film was the plot and how it was all mixed toward the end. I couldn't make sense with the plot twists, and the ending left me a bit puzzled. Maybe I should've read the book first. But it was a decent, but not fantastic, movie nonetheless.
B001U0HBPQ|4.0|Director David Fincher employs spectacular cinematography, subtle digital photography and the backdrop of one of America's most unusual cities to film an extremely loose adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" and manages to fascinate his audiences as they glimpse at one man's life even though the film's running time stretches on for an almost excruciatingly uncomfortable two hours and 47 minutes.<br /><br />The film's premise revolves around being born old and living life in reverse. It flirts with the idea of being dependent in the beginning and at the end no matter which way one starts out putting more of an emphasis on the years in the middle where we are responsible for ourselves and can fully savor and enjoy the moments we create as if they are mini works of art. As illustrated by Benjamin's exploits, all the people that flow through one's memory with their stories and viewpoints help formulate all those big questions whose answers defy identification and perhaps are rendered irrelevant when thought about in context with little perfect pearl moments that group together to fashion a necklace of experience that reaches beyond larger absolute ideals with the tangibility of the senses rather than that of solely the intellect.<br /><br />Most important of all, perhaps, is the notion that as we move through life at times we walk with others who move in the same direction. Their time with us is ephemeral yet relevant to what we need at the time as the ultimate and lingering wisdom they impart provides a building block to our progressive development. Sadly all relationships, good and bad, are fraught with the same fragile rule that all things--be it a mother, father, lover, child--must pass.<br /><br />The fact that main protagonist Mr. Button, played with a pleasant insouciance by Brad Pitt, begins as an infant octogenarian complete with cataracts, arthritis and heart disease adds an obvious nuance to the curiosity factor that an audience would possess for any character that is depicted on the big screen. While a definite amount of curiousness does describe a life that begins old and becomes younger as time progresses, the actual aspect of viewing life and the world as a vehicle in which to exercise and expand one's natural curiosity amplifies what could be only the strange subject of a sideshow to a larger platform of universal proportions.<br /><br />The players in this assembly more than adequately come together with a synergy that emphasizes that the sum of the parts do indeed create a whole that exceeds each individual piece. During the first person narrative of Benjamin's story, the focus on Cate Blanchette's (Daisy, Benjamin's main squeeze) face manages to convey the inner loveliness of a character that matures over time from the more selfish thoughts of self, to thoughts of Benjamin, to their shared life together and then most beautifully later on to those who need her most. In a smaller role, the typically androgynous Tilda Swinson glows like a nascent star with a complexion awash in the soft light one would affix to one about to fall in love again and explore another human being.<br /><br />In the same vein, the city of New Orleans beams with its own special personality and that hint of mystery that one cannot see by just scraping the surface. For once, the filmmakers do not over do the Creole/Cajun flare of Southeast Louisiana with the usual blare of Bourbon Street jazz and Southern-fried bayou caricatures that depict the city and its environs in an extreme light devoid of appeal but long on kitsch. Instead, New Orleans is filmed as it is with a quiet diffused hauteur and distinct character that no other city in America possesses. The shotgun houses shine in clapboard glory; streetcars gleam with old-fashioned charm; Lake Pontchartrain births a brilliant tangerine and pink grapefruit sunrise adrift with placid waves in balmy air that suggests a private world of privilegethat those still mesmerized by the third world images circulated during Katrina will fail to recognize. Only insiders see New Orleans from this perspective. An Oscar nod here for the lovely whimsical cinematography that utilizes an `Amelie' quality (sepia sequences, reverse photography, etc.) during certain segments to add comic relief (the seven strike of lightning) and to stress the coincidence in little events that domino effect into something larger and more consequential.<br /><br />Where the film fails is in its telling of Benjamin's story as Daisy's deathbed disclosure. This overly sentimental contrivance seems more appropriate for the Lifetime or Hallmark Channel rather than the lead-in for a plotline that has a hard time balancing its wonder and its sorrow. The shadow of Katrina looming in the near future adds nothing but insult to injury, reminding the audience of the current plight of New Orleans of which the Bradelina brood, as relatively new citizens, have taken a special interest. Perhaps the filmmaker intended to yet again emphasize the idea that yes, relationships do come to an end. Daisy and her daughter (Julia Ormond) must say `goodbye.' On a larger level, Katrina's destruction will sever ties to a city, to family members, to beloved pets and homes that housed generations. More akin to the story, Daisy's daughter must bid adieu to someone she barely remembered; the pain of this is left open-ended. Only Benjamin with his backwards look at the world has the dogged complacency to handle all the death that crosses his path without going ballistic-fatalistic, but then again he was pretty much born dead. We are expected to believe that a young precocious child would be chemically attracted to a wizened old man with a child's height--now that's a bit of a stretch. Confused images of the storm, hummingbirds and the ironic joke of the clock intended to reverse time muddy the waters further--none of these recurring ideas are really given substance or actual definition--they just appear whimsically like Benjamin himself.<br /><br />Bottom line? \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' can be long and at times seem like a long airplane flight where occasional stretches up and down the aisle are essential to survival. Thinkers will question the relevance of the main character's curious ailment and ponder over the various messages the film seems to throw out. Blanchette wows as the lovely Daisy while Pitt uses his celebrity to sing the praises of his adopted city during his celluloid evolution from shriveled oldster to . . . none other than Brad Pitt.

0440238609|1.0|The first 2 books - they were ok. The third, what a let down. I feel that I have a knack for picking trilogies that start out promising only to be utterly disappointed with the ending. The authors open hostility with the \\"magisterium\\" (it wasn't hard to see the the comparison to organized religion - especially on the Christian side) was almost amusing from an adult's perspective during the first 2 books. They had fantastical elements and yet I truly felt like the universe that Lyra was living in could have been an alternate universe for ours. The Ice Bears were a treat during the first book. The second book - well, that too was fantastical, but I wondered where things were going to go, because it got dark and creepy and the idea of the creatures that were created by the tares in the dimensions from the knife - I still after finishing the third book wasn't sure how that got resolved, or what their point in the whole story was.<br /><br />The first book was, despite the religious thing, fantastical and mythical and had an interesting plot.  The gobblers stealing children; Lyra being able to read the compass (I can't spell what the book called it!); Oxford; the Ice Bears (awesome idea).  And Pan - I absolutely adore Pan.  I think he is my favorite part of the series.  The idea of your conscious (or soul, maybe?) as a separate but integral part - the manifestation in the animal - is unique and I though was clever.  But the turn this book took towards religion, yikes.  I for one took it as hostility towards organized religion.  But that was me.  And to me, it wasn't veiled in the least.  It was open and there for all to easily attempt to digest.<br /><br />The second book left me confused and disturbed.  Getting introduced to the boy's universe was uncomfortable to say the least.  The creatures that were created - were way to dark and creepy for me.  I am in a lot of ways glad they haven't (yet anyway) attempted to make the second book into a movie - because I don't see any way it could reasonably be turned into a family film.  It was more horror book then YA/fantasy.  And, I still, after finishing the third book, wasn't sure how that got resolved, or what their point in the whole story was.  The knife and the idea of what it could do was almost a distraction.  Honestly, I think a slightly different ending to book one should have been the end to the series.  The author should have left well enough alone.<br /><br />The third book...  well, I guess this was supposed to be the redemption?  Learning about how a world/dimension/universe (what ever) gets created?  And yet the hostility towards the Magesterium didn't stop.  So was the message supposed to be that we should embrace religion but be weary of organized churches?  That is certainly one way I could have felt.  And I guess I did.  But I was more bothered by issues left unresolved by this book.  And I was still bothered by the idea that was left \\"out there\\" that hitting puberty turns one evil.  I mean really, is that what children should be taught?  I guess there are certain groups of people that believe that way, but I am not.  And I took some offense to what this series seemed to stand for in many ways.  I understand the hostility towards the church, but I think books aimed at children that are so overtly religious should come with warnings, so that I know to avoid them.  And I think teaching intolerance, which is one of the themes I got from this series, is unacceptable no matter what age the audience is.<br /><br />The third installment made me draw a lot of similarities towards the Magician's Nephew (I think... the one were we see the development of a new world).  And it's not a novel take on the idea.  And frankly, the writing isn't as good.  Point me towards the Narnia Chronicles anytime over this set.  (And, the religiousness isn't quite as in-your-face in those as it is here).<br /><br />I read a review where there was a quote that stated: \\"Philip Pullman contends that 'There are some themes, some subjects, too large for adult fiction; they can only be dealt with adequately in a children's book.' \\" I hate to disagree, but I think there are clearly some themes that should not be dealt with in a children's book, and Philip Pullman should have steered clear of some of the themes he tried to tackle. I don't know if they were too big for a children's book (and honestly, should have been dealt with in an adult book) or if they were just too big for Mr. Pullman himself. Either way, I felt he didn't know how to end the series without getting so religious, I might as well have pulled out a bible if I wanted that much religion.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, I felt there was a lot of open hostility towards the church (and I am by no means a staunch church-go-er) during the first book (at least) so the turn around with how religious things got and how the message seemed to be that religion saves, caught me off guard.<br /><br />And the notion that hitting puberty turns you evil - is just something that I feel has no place in a child's book. A similar review I read called this a children's book that is \\"Christian\\" the same way the Chronicles of Narnia are Christian - and I wish I would have seen that review before reading these. I remember loving Narnia when I was younger, and now, as an adult who loves YA/Fantasy books, I can only read certain portions of the Narnia series because others are by far to pro-religion for me (and given what I said earlier about pointing me to Narnia anytime over this series... that says something!).  And so, while to moral of the 3rd book has something to do with the establishment of religion (honestly, I wasn't sure exactly what it was) - I should have read the first 2 and then just read the Wiki article to see how the third concluded the series. I would not recommend this SERIES to anyone who doesn't want an opinion (good or bad) about religion shoved down their throat.ects, too large for adult fiction; they can only be dealt with adequately in a children's book.' \\" I hate to disagree, but I think there are clearly some themes that should not be dealt with in a children's book, and Philip Pullman should have steered clear of some of the themes he tried to tackle.

B0002KVULG|4.0|Academy-Award nominee Frank Langella (Best Actor, [[ASIN:B001TH92N4 Frost/Nixon]]) reprised a role he played onstage in this near-masterpiece, yet flawed, film version of Bram Stoker's classic.    A fine cast and fine production characterizes this slightly tweaked storyline in which the charming Count Dracula (Langella) arrives at the home of Dr. Seward (Donald Pleasence) after purchasing a residence nearby. Dr. Seward's daughter Lucy (Kate Nelligan) and her lovely friend Mina (Jan Francis) are mysteriously drawn to the intriguing Count, while Lucy's fiancée Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve) is immediately suspicious of him. After Mina dies mysteriously, her father Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Laurence Olivier) arrives as Count Dracula begins his seduction of Lucy.    Of course, the familiar, bug-eating character Renfield (Tom Haygarth) is also present, but I'll come back to that.    The film is very well-made with a beautiful visual tone, giving it a classic feel. Made in 1979, the film has aged very well and many of the sets look like they were used later by someone like Tim Burton. The costume design, art/set direction, and cinematography are all beautiful.     All performances are strong. There's a role reversal in the characters of Lucy and Mina, so at first you think the actresses were cast in the wrong roles, but both fit the mold perfectly. Tom Haygarth plays Renfield better than most, as he actually looks like a raving maniac. Finally, there's Langella, whose performance rivals Bela Lugosi's as the definitive Dracula. From his first few moments onscreen, he is absolutely electrifying and seethes sexuality in a way that no other incarnation of Dracula has.    So, what's wrong with it? The biggest problem is the script. The romantic sub-plot doesn't feel like a device of the plot but rather, a way to draw a more female audience. There's also the part where Mina appears in vampire form and looks pretty ridiculous. More ridiculous than that though is the car/carriage chase scene.    Dracula is a well-acted, well-made film and it's sad that it just can't reach its full potential. But it's worth watching, if only for the beauty of the production and Langella's arresting performance.    GRADE: B

B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is music for a certain type of person, I mean lets be serious, a main stream person just doesn't have that special place inside where Muse lives all nestled and warm. With the Twilight soundtrack it is bittersweet for me, I want Muse to get all the attention they deserve yet felt like \\"ok people, like duh, this isn't like a new release song or anything, if you just explore the world of music a bit more you would have found that powerful track and more sooner\\". But I don't want to be that bitter. So, on that note, this is one of my all time top 10 bands. I found this band while living in Hawaii dating a complex Marine Biologist in my early 20's. This album was the soundtrack for our lives for a short while and really encompassed the beauty around us and the intensity of our emotions and bodies. What a dramatic place and time for me. Take Absolution and listen to it on your own at first in a barely lite house and mabey a glass of wine or nice chilly beer. Listen to it from beginning to end and don't be araid to dance around in your own private tribal ceremony. Lay and stare at your ceiling and let the words really come to you. Only after you have a little alone time with it can you enjoy it with others. This is YOUR album, not a social album, not for a room full of people. You, and a select few, or just that special one ready to let this album bring you two to a new climax.

I do with the full acoustic set was a bit longer, but the JMT, and Mayer and his full band are really good.  There isn't much but music on here and I like that.  Some videos on musicians have a lot of cut scenes with them not playing music.  Some may not like this, but I bought it for the music, not to see John driving his car around and talking.  A great show, don't hesitate if you are a Mayer fan.

B00000273P|4.0|Yup, it really is as good as everyone says.  There's nothing to say about the songwriting besides superlatives.<br /><br />Thomas Dolby's production is modern mastery.  For each track, he unerringly pulls out the 40 colors and brushes that make it work[**].  For example, listen to the title track, the way he handles the vocals and brief instrumental touches as it shifts from Elvis-like \\"I'm just waitin' for the right song - Then I'm comin' back\\" to the whoahs and shimmering guitar on \\"End of the road I'm travelling, I will see Jordan beckoning\\".  UNBELIEVABLE!<br /><br />But I can understand reviewer Scott Fisher's disapproval: a) a lot of the paints are synthetics, especially the brass and woodwind parts.  On his own records and Joni Mitchell's [[ASIN:B000000OXY Dog Eat Dog]] Thomas Dolby took the time to make synthetic sounds work with the music, but Paddy McAloon's songs could use more organic sounds &mdash; I wish they had had the recording budget for live studio musicians.  And b), apart from the propulsive opener \\"Looking for Atlantis\\" and the punctuation on \\"Wiiiild Hohr-se-e-esz\\", there's no evidence of Dolby's innate white boy funk that creates rhythm patterns that drive songs like locomotives.  There's not much syncopation to latch onto in the ruminative songs, but that doesn't excuse the lack of rhythmic invention.<br /><br />Like all Prefab Sprout albums after [[ASIN:B0000277EE Protest Songs]] some songs may seem to have a sugary, schmaltzy sheen, but as with Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach's [[ASIN:B00000AFFF Painted from Memory]], it's an integral part of the whole.  For fifty years angry+noisy==authentic, but Paddy McAloon is continuing a songwriting tradition twice as old as that.  Give the songs a chance to sink in, and/or start with Steve McQueen aka [[ASIN:B00000264P Two Wheels Good]] (one of the best albums ever, despite and because it's less ambitious).<br /><br />[**] As opposed to 2000s pop where every song has 50 channels of sludge poured all over it throughout.  On any recent pop song, try to tell what instruments are playing in the chorus behind the singer!ecent pop song, try to tell what instruments are playing in the chorus behind the singer!

B001CTDH4Y|5.0|When I saw the trailer for Beverly Hills Chihuahua the movie seemed silly and overly sentimental. On renting the DVD my opinion was changed. The film is a nice little adventure story set in Mexico.     The story concerns Chloe, a very spoiled Chihuahua, who is indulged by her human played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Chloe (nicely voiced by Drew Barrymore) is part of the dog smart set and has her own social schedule and a collar from Harry Winston that costs a small fortune.  She spurns the attentions of the landscapers Chihuahua named Popi because he is not in her class. The story gets interesting when Jamie Lee Curtis must go to Europe on a business trip and leaved Chloe with her niece Rachel (played by Piper Perabo) who is a not very responsible.      Rachel is invited to go on a short trip to Mexico and takes Chloe along. This is where the adventure begins as Chloe is stolen by a dog-fighting ring but manages to escape.  There is a race to find Chloe, who is protected by a German Sheppard named Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia) between the dog fighters (who want to ransom Chloe) and Rachael.     What makes the film satisfying is that the characters develop and change. Chloe realizes the value of friendship and that she has been spoiled and Rachael becomes more responsible and determined in her search for the missing Chloe.  There also is an interesting sub-plot with two abandoned dogs that need a new home and find one thanks to Rachel.     Altogether this is a satisfying film with a lot of humor and adventure. In the process, we learn about Chihuahuas and have a good time.  The story is well-conceived and the actors do a marvelous job.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|With the price of Blue Ray discs so high I have found myself renting more than buying but there are a few titles out there whose rental convinces me that they are worth spending a little extra. Ironman is an excellent example of the power of blue ray, an extremely polished film and one that looks absolutely stunning on Blue Ray.     As a movie I have found myself rewatching the first hour more than the second. As with any comic book origin story you learn where the hero comes from, what pushes him to risking his life for others, and a little about where he is going. The interesting thing with this film is that it is far stronger in its early stages when we are learning these facets of our hero than it is after the hero has been constructed (literally in this case). It almost feels as though once the premise is all in place the writers were not really sure what to do with him so they fabricated a quick enemy for him to fight. As an origin story though it is very engaging.     So after we have discovered the why and the who behind our superhero there needs to be a super villain standing in opposition and this is where I think the movie falters a little. I got a trifle bored in the last quarter of the movie once the villain of the piece has been revealed. I almost wish they had have ended the story after the origin part was over and spent more time in a sequal on setting up a major villain.     Here is hoping that ironman 2 gives us a more convincing nemesis.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|When Tony Kushner sticks to actual events, he's got a fast, thrilling script for Spielberg to work. The trouble is, a fine action movie is saddled with philosophical meanderings. The obviously contrived debate between the Mossad assassin and the PLO guy, the same old hackneyed arguments about what is essentially a land dispute, well, come on, why didn't the PLO guy realize Eric Bana really was a Jew? All the PLO fighters tell you how much they love their Palestine and Allah is their leader. Of course, the barbarity that meets their aims, all praised in heaven. Jews prefer a settled life on Earth be as it may, but there's little peace in the Middle East.     I must tell you, The Soprano's or Godfather movies were suggested by the Munich revenge assassinations. The Mossad is so careful not to knock off civilians, too careful perhaps as their foes could care less. Good versus evil, makes for a better story, but not if you're political liberal.

B001N26GFC|3.0|Well, Poppy's bright personality put me off at first. It's relentlessly, ah, happy-go-lucky. She's perceptive. She's a pretty neat teacher. The film is an advertisement for the Teachers Unions I think. Bully in the schoolyard: she'll get the social worker on the job, mate. On the other hand, she's a thirty-year-old single lady with time on her hands, as her gal pals are dressing up for dance night or Flamingo lessons. There's a very funny moment in that dance lesson, but you'll see for yourself.     Anyhow, Poppy grows on you. Her nemesis, the gruff, angry, Scott, the driving instructor with a mother complex and bad teeth, well, there's really uncomfortable moments for drama in a slice of life Brit comedy. It also should be noted: if you're used to fast cutting, quick action angles, this one develops slowly, sort of as if it were a BBC sitcom.

This tour is the one that got them in the spotlight and while getting the chance to see them and hear them for the first time I picked up this copy of the album, even got it signed by the band. Listened to it all the way home and ever since I have been a huge supporter of the group.<br /><br />Comalies even after hearing all the previous albums and later albums is still my favorite. It was the album they mixed their previous slower, moodier style with their newer darker heavier style. A perfect blend of everything Lacuna Coil has to offer. But the reason you need to get this version is because of the second disc. Four acoustic tracks done in the studio, that are a haunting contrast to their 'plugged' counterparts. Most especially the acoustic version of 'Unspoken' which is a haunting yet beautiful rendition of the original, I prefer the acoustic version to the original.<br /><br />The two radio edits are interesting as it gives the fan a chance to compare definitively to the original. Swamped was edited a great deal to cut time for shorter air play which is a shame because they cut a couple of my favorite parts from the song. At the end of the second disc you get three tracks recorded live over a radio station which includes the short but moving Aeon, easily one of the most haunting tracks on the original album. They call these live but they might as well be studio as the quality is just amazing.<br /><br />All in all as a fan of the band I have to recommend ANYONE planning on buyiong this for the first time to get this version. The extra tracks won't be easy to find anywhere else and are a wonderful contrast to the album's rock/ metal version's. If you already own the album I would advise shopping around for the best price, possibly even used, just to get the second album. The price is worth the quality and it doesn't get much better then this, which in my opinion is the best female fronted metal album ever. Thank you reading and I hope my review helped.<br /><br />-A loyal Lacuna Coil Fany is just amazing.

0553582038|2.0|I as most of the other reviewers absolutely loved the rest of this series.  They were absolute page turners.  That being said this book is almost entirely lacking in a plot.  Instead of one story told from 3 or 4 perspectives as is the case with the first few books, this is 7+ stories told from even more perspectives.  None of the \\"plots\\" of these stories interact with each other and what's worse is that {SPOILER ALERT STORM OF SWORDS) all of the characters that are left after the mass killing in a storm of swords are to be blunt boring with the notable exceptions of Arya, Sam, and John Snow whom the book hardly ever visits.  I listened to the entire series as audio books while I work and drive.  With this book, I found myself re-listening to as much as an hour of the book before I even noticed because my attention wanders so dramatically.  Finishing it was a chore that I felt i had to get through in anticipation of the next book and resolution of some of the story lines hanging from ASOS.  Now that I find that the next book isn't scheduled to be released to fall of '09 and many people expect it to push (ridiculously) beyond that I feel perhaps I have wasted my time.
B00008WT5C|5.0|this album almost makes you wish that Bon Scott was still on the mic. standout tracks on this album are \\"Let There Be Rock\\", \\"Problem Child\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\". \\"Problem Child\\" sounds like it should be a B-side to \\"TNT\\". R.I.P. Bon
B001IAOEXU|5.0|This is a detailed review about these fantastic triggers!      [Build / Installation]  ****************    These triggers are made from a firm plastic with the number 2 (for R2/L2) engraved on the top. They are color matched EXACTLY to the original button color and are very sturdy. The color is the color of the plastic, it is not painted on, which is a good thing because these will not fade.    The bottom of the trigger has a thin canal that lets you slip the triggers on and snap them into place. Because they snap in, there is no risk that these will slip off or come off easily.    The back is open, which means you can see into the structure of the trigger and the original R2/L2 buttons. This isn't such a big deal because I doubt anybody will be looking there.      [Performance]  ***********    These are a rare product that actually will improve your performance in the game and improve the performance of the controller itself.    The triggers help give you a great grip on the controller and give you the ability to very firmly press the R2/L2 without slippage. It helps because you don't have to adjust your fingers at any point because of how firmly it helps keep your fingers in place. This allows you to concentrate more on every other aspect of the game because you don't have to subconciously think of keeping your fingers on the controller.      [Final Thoughts]  *************    If you own a PS3, play games on a PS3, or even just own a PS3 controllers, these are a MUST HAVE!      *********  * 5/5 Stars  *********
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I love this CD!  Every song on it is good.  I usually will like 3 or 4 songs on a CD but this one literally every song is excellent.  You can't say that about too many cds.  Stop and Stare is my absolute favorite and the hit Apologize never gets old.  Goodbye apathy and Prodigal are great too.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I love this tv show!  My daughter introduced it to me and I couldn't stop watching it.  I've also bought and watched the 3rd Season.  Very good!!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This film has brought back something that has been missing from horror films... intelligence!  This film is not for the ridiculous horror buff who likes slaughter and special effects...    What I also found interesting is that all of the reviewers who gave this film only one star loved the movie but hated the dubbing and translations but loved the movie!
0740748475|4.0|Great collection of work.  I especially love the history of how it was created.  It does fit awfully tight into the cover, but otherwise, and absolutely great purchase!!!
B001PPLIFU|3.0|While Daniel Craig is ok as James Bond, Quantom of Solace was not a James Bond (Ian Flemming) style film.  At the begining we have the dialog between Bond and M where Bond promises not to revenge the death of Vesper.  Yet, thats the plot line for the whole movie.  The interaction between Bond and \\"M\\" is dark.   Very few clever \\"Bond\\" lines, not much in the way of \\"Bond\\" Gagets, even the normal James Bond intro and theme song was missing.  Pierce Brosnan is much more the James Bond we have come to know.  Audio note:  While it is released in DTS Master Audio, it's only a 5.1 mix.
B001QB9H10|2.0|This movie shows what a good (in this case, bad) director can do for a film. Transporter 2 was great. This is a pale echo of the series' past glories. The actress is horrible, the action is cut in a jarring \\"Borne\\" style and there's really nothing to care about. A big disappointment.
B001SN78JO|3.0|Yes Man has some decent laughs and the chemsitry between Allison (Zoey Deschanel) and Carl (Jim Carrey) is really sweet. The idea of saying yes and having good things happen to people is a sweet idea, and it's played well here. Sadly Jim Carrey does a few too many goofy faces, silly talk, and bad singing. A good percentage of the jokes fall pretty flat.<br /><br />The good: Zoey Deschanel's body of work is beginning to look like fun. A band-aid in Almost Famous, always quirky. She performs a number of songs in this film, and can genuinely sing. It wan't just a quirk during the bathroom scene in Elf. Zoey is a member of the group She & Him, [[ASIN:B0012IWHQO Volume One]]. I loved the mooneyes on her helmet [[ASIN:B000RDGJ9G Johnny Lightning Mooneyes 1960's Shelby Cobra SILVER]]from the 50/60/70's drag racing era. The Eels perform a good percentage of the soundtrack. This is an amazing indie group, [[ASIN:B000Y2WAKM Meet the Eels: Essential Eels 1996-2006, Vol. 1]], [[ASIN:B000062YAJ Souljacker [Bonus Disc]]]. The lead singer's father came up with the physics theory of parallel universes, [[ASIN:B001MYIPXC NOVA: Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives]]. Mostly Jim Carrey is funny. The supporting cast is very good overall.<br /><br />The not so great: The direction was not outstanding. The film was very uneven. It really got legs with around 30 minutes to go, the peak of funny. Peyton Reed has directed such great humorous films as The Love Bug for television, Bring it On, and Bad Haircut. Jim Carrey did just too many of those horrible facial expressions from Mask.<br /><br />An Illustration of how the early part of the film was not exactly riviting cinema. Carl makes a pretty big deal out of picking up a copy of 300 in the video store. The movie then progresses a few days, maybe a week. Carl goes back to the video store and rents some random movies - clearly he returned 300 by that time - and we never see the movie titles. The next time we see him watching a movie, it's a clip (pun intended, a man is cutting off his leg) from Saw. And then a clip from 300. What, how could that be, he returned 300 already. Ah, a silly little continuity error. Oh, bigger point, the film was not interesting enough that I was looking for that kind of thing.<br /><br />The film is rated PG-13 and personally, I think that was a gift. There are some scenes I did not want my 13 year old son to watch. There is a scene of an old woman, that asks Carl if he'd like sexual relief. He finally says yes (well there's his covenant to always say yes). The next montage is of him laying on the bed, her moving her way down his body, a shot of her teeth in a glass, and then a shot of Carl's reaction to having a very enjoyable orgasm. That thread is repeated later in the movie when one of his buddies goes to a back room with this old woman and says, I've heard a lot about what you can do. There were a few too many fairly adult jokes and visuals in this film. The language was a bit strong here and there. I'm not protective of my son, however, this was just wrong for his age.<br /><br />The single disc DVD edition contains no bonus features at all. There are English subtitles for the hearing impared.p (pun intended, a man is cutting off his leg) from Saw. And then a clip from 300. What, how could that be, he returned 300 already.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|A total joy from start to finish. If this is what we get when the Writer's Guild strikes, then maybe they should take a month or so off more often.
B001F290E4|5.0|I heard \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" by Seal on Larry King and just fell in love with the way he sang it and the \\"sexinest\\" and \\"soulfulness\\" of Seal gave me a different view of him.   I was curious about the CD and listen to some of the samples of the CD on your site and I had to have it. I thought he did a great job; the songs are so right on point for today.  What wonderful lyrics and music, Seal is incredible, buy the CD you will love it.  the songs are classic his touch on them is wonderful and he delivers on each one.  This is my first Seal CD and it is wonderful !!!!  when he sings  Here I am Baby....oh man what a song I dance all around my kitchen.    By the way I love that your site allows me to listen to samples of CDs before buying, this is the reason why I buy all my CDs only from your sie.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I have all three of their DVD's, and undoubtably this is the BEST!!!  I watch or listent to it often.
B00127RAJY|4.0|the exercises look simple enough...but looks are deceiving.  If you really want to bust through that plateau - Jillian is definately the one to do it. I saw results after one week.
B001CTDH58|1.0|[[ASIN:B001CTDH4Y Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.  Although I am a Jamie Lee Curtis fan, I would not recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 5.
