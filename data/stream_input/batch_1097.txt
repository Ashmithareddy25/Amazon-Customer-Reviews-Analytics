B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that shares a love story in a way that you don't have to be afraid of letting your kids go to it too.  The movie tells the story of a girl whose parents are divorced and whose heart has become hardened not only to her father, but to life in general.  After she and her brother are sent to spend the summer with her father, she discovers that she doesn't know as much as she thought she did, nor is she as hardened to love as she'd tried to be.  When a complete stranger hits on her, they later fall in love, and she discovers how much he really cares.  Also, she discovers how much her father loves his kids, as he is hiding a fatal illness and greatly longs to spend last moments with them.  This is a must-see movie that you will find yourself relating to and laughing and crying with.  A+++!!!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Awesome Collection-Even Better on Blu-Ray. All movies plus the Anime and tons of hours of extras, can't go wrong with that, and the price of $19.99 for all-awesome. Highly recommend to any Matrix fan.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|\\"Despicable Me\\" has state of the art copy-cat Pixar animation and well-honed characters.  The minions are darling and the three little orphan girls are sweetly sincere.  The Villainous Gru (Steve Carell) has a soft heart underneath his evil exterior so you can guess the theme.  Although the story as many creative points, the story sags with an over-abundance of frenetic attack scenes with odd weapons.<br /><br />The plot revolves around evil genius bad guys who want to out-do each other in bad deeds.  This film will surely entertain the kids as a plot hatches to shrink and steal the moon as the most outlandish evil deed that can be done.<br /><br />The gadgets are fun, and the minions give creative boost, so it is entertaining, but just a tad weak for adults who have seen these type of plots before.
B00122B8EW|5.0|Punk/Rock whenever you hear this say Green Day because these guys are amazing. Even though Insomniac has a darker tone than I would like it's still a good album. But there is one problem...WHERE'S J.A.R.?! I mean, I know Insomniac wouldn't be the same with J.A.R. but I think that they should've put it as a secret song after Walking Contradiction. Anyway, here's my review song by song    1. Armatage Shanks    Great intro to the album if you were to buy this album and show this to an alien make it listen to this song more than the others! 10/10    2. Brat    Awesome song wish they would play it more often though 10/10    3. Stuck With Me    2nd Darkest Song on the album but shouldn't be named Stuck With Me 8/10    4. Geek Stink Breath    Good Song Gross Video What more can you say? 10/10    5. No Pride    Short but sweet...and dark 10/10    6. Bab's Uvula Who?    Don't undertstand the lyrics but it's has nothing to do with the name of the song 9/10    7. 86    Darkest Song on the album 10/10    8. Panic Song    When does the intro stop? In 1 week? Just kidding one of my favorite songs on the album 9/10    9. Stuart and the Ave.    We're all f***ed up! Nice bass intro and chorus! 10/10    10 & 11. Brain Stew/Jaded    Best. Heavy. Metal. Song. Ever! I love the fact this also transfers into Jaded! 10/10    12. Westbound Sign    The only reason why I'm giving this song a low grade is because the instrumental version was used in Cars 7/10    13. Tight Wad Hill    Still can't get the lyrics right! 9/10    14. Walking Contradiction    I love the video and the song. Hasn't been played live since they were at Warped in 2000! 10/10    15. J.A.R.*    While not on the album, it's a very good song! It should've been in the album no matter what. Insomniac could have been higher in the album rankings in '95 if they had put this #1 hit on the album! 10/10
B000FCK8ZK|3.0|I love the Dexter Showtime series and I was realy looking forward to reading the book series however I must say I am a little disappointed. It took me a month to finish this book and that's not my usual reading speed. It just didn't capture my attention like the television series. And of course, things are different. I have decided to just stick to the show and I won't be reading the next book.
B001TH7GT6|2.0|The product works great, but the RCA connectors are two wide and press up against eachother when they are plugged in to AV equipment. It is not my equipment - I experience the same issue in my receiver, television, and dvd player. I'm worried this may be causing the RCA connectors to be slightly stressed and could lead to them failing early.
0307272702|4.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book, and if you had trouble slogging through \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" then it might be worth giving this one a try -- it is much more reasonable. And it wouldn't be a wasted purchase because, once you've got the basic understanding from this book, you can consult the longer book for more depth on a particular area.    This book is receiving quite a lot of mention and a number of people seem particularly enthusied that this \\"isn't a diet book\\". And, technically, that's true -- it is more about the science behind why we get fat, and it is quite clear in telling you what you must do to lose weight. But if you try and formulate an eating plan around these ideas, you will quickly realize that it *is* a diet book. Unless you have an appetite for unending meat, cheese, and nuts, and are happy to give up vegetables, bread, milk, and even whole grains, this will ultimately be a diet book.    In true scientific form, he isolates the question of weight loss from the question of overall health, and suggests that exercise is not necessary for weight loss while also pointing out that exercise might be good for other reasons. I had trouble with this part, because I have seen people lose weight from exercise without changing their diet much.    He keeps coming back to reference Michael Pollan, but I don't understand the connection, other than them being New York Times chums. Michael Pollan's \\"advice\\" (which he is not particularly qualified to give -- and this is supposed to be a science-based book) often contradicts that of Gary Taubes's reading of the science. \\"Eat Food. Not Too Much. Mostly Plants\\" is one of Pollan's catchphrases, but this book takes considerable time to point out that vegetables are not compatible with comfortable weight loss, and that the quantity of food and even calorie density is not as important as what is eaten. But, the Michael Pollan mentions are the only blemish on an otherwise seemingly adherence to fact-based science.    A number of times, I drew parallels to Nina Planck's \\"Real Food\\" book. Some of the same arguments were made, but \\"Real Food\\" was much more about whole food itself than about the science and wasn't at all a diet book (it was more a book that gave you permission to eat foods that you've been told are bad for you). They would be very good companion books.    Where this book does seem to distinguish itself from some others is that it encourages self-assessment rather than a one-size-fits-all prescription. It suggests cutting carbs to lose weight and then perhaps restoring them to a level where you can maintain a desired weight, for example, rather than suggesting a one-size-fits-all that must be followed by one and all. But I have not read enough diet books to know whether how unique this advice is, and when he says this he often seems to be referencing othet diet plans.    Where this book really stands out is in its substantiated criticism of \\"calories in, calories out\\". I don't understand why this theory has held up for so long, because anyone who pays attention to how their body reacts to different foods know that it is not a matter of calories.    Overall, though, this *is* a diet book. After finishing the book and looking for ways to \\"improve\\" my own diet according to what he had written, I found that almost everything I ate would be affected, and I am not overweight, seldom eat out and eat very little overly-sugary or processed food. This is perhaps his point about the Western diet, but it also makes it a diet book that would have you give up the things you most enjoy eating and replacing them with things that, whether based on misinformation or not, you have a psychological aversion to overdosing on.    I can't fault the book for the above criticisms (other than the Michael Pollan one) because it doesn't promise to be anything more than it is -- the title is perfectly accurate. If you have tried diets and don't understand why they don't work, this book is well worth the read. But whether or not you want to do what is required to lose weight (even when it doesn't require exercise) is another issue. If you have tried the Atkins Diet, you might not find much new here -- it is essentially the same message, though you might come away with a better understanding of why Atkins works.
141690977X|1.0|I don't even understand why this book is so popular. I suppose I should blame Oprah.    I'm a firm believer that you can be with anyone you wish to be with. It is how you approach the situation. If you approach a man with wearing all of your insecurities on your sleeve, he probably won't be \\"that into you\\". And, this here is a the perfect segue into the main problem with this book.    Most relationship problems are related to self-esteem issues and negativity. This book does not address how to manage your self-esteem. It does not go into why you feel that you need this one person. It tries to provide a simple solution to a not so simple problem a lot of women have. Worst of all none of these people have any degrees on psychology at all!    Maybe this book is good for the few women that cannot get past the negativity they feel for being ignored, cheated on, ditched, ect. At this point though, I would recommend taking a break from relationships in general, but I digress.
B000002KOO|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums. I remember attending concerts in Southern California as they were disintegrating. I have always wondered why the original British version was never released on CD. It did not have   \\"Oh Well\\" or \\"Fighting For Madge\\" but it did have \\"Without You\\", and \\"One Sunny Day\\". Seems like they could remaster it and add add these two additional cuts and have a whole new ad campaign.
030746363X|5.0|I had never heard of this book until turning on Dr. Oz this morning.  I too have struggled my whole life with dieting and weight loss, only to have it all come back eventually.   I am now 58 and weigh more than I ever have.   I am curious about the varying degrees of opinions regarding this man's book and ideas.  Dr. Oz talked at length about it and said his researchers did extensive testing of all of his weight loss ideas.   He was 100% behind this man.   Therefore, not based on all of the comments of the people who have purchased this book and had results, I will use Dr. Oz's opinion, explanations  and research team as advice I want to follow.   Therefore, I have just purchased this book.
0767903862|3.0|First off, for those readers who chose to give this book only one or two stars: I really don't think this was intended as a \\"normal\\" travel book. Yes, one could use the book as such a thing, but it would take a long, long time to travel to even a few of the separate regions Bryson visits in between his book tours and other tasks. (However, in defense of those criticisms, it is Dewey-Decimeled with the travel books.) Second, I do have criticisms of the book, but I have to say that it is one of the more humorous books ever. Whether you've been to the land of OZ (or not), some of the passages are laugh-out-loud, read-out-loud-to-whomever-is-nearby FUNNY. He is so on target about Sydneysiders, the history (political, geographic, and natural) that it seems to stream out of his pen in almost an unconscious manner. Third, if you read only selected chapters (say you are looking up something about Adelaide), you are going to miss other references to places that are scattered in the telling.     The book would have been greatly enhanced by an INDEX! Hello...I could have made an index for this book in about two hours. Also, the prefacing two pages (containing 4 maps) do not even begin to site all the places Bryson speaks of. How much trouble would it have been to put a full-page (hand-drawn, as the ones in the book are) map somewhere alongside each section? Few of us are actually going to drive or take the trains over the continent, but certainly it helps when speaking of these tiny towns to have some idea how far along the sunburned highway the writer has progressed.    Sometimes facts are shoved aside in favor of humor, but again, is this a traditional travel book? I'd say no. However, I enjoyed it a whole lot and wish I'd read it before going to Australia. It would have been easy to make the Ozzies the butt of all jokes, but many jokes come at the expense of the British and other nationalities. I'd give this book as a gift to anyone who needs cheering up, that's for sure.
1582701709|5.0|Thus book is easy to read, concise and doable.  Even though this book speaks from an earthly prospective, it uses biblical principles for success. As a spiritual minded person and one who puts God first in his life, I can identify with the secret.
B003ZK58WM|4.0|I toggled on my K3 with a little anxiety. I half expected Ken Follett's \\"Fall of Giants\\" to be like a diorama you might see in a history museum, a book version of a lighted wall of curving plaster and paint representing a slice of history - \\"The Winning of the West,\\" for example - illustrated with tableaus of significant events, colorful with lots of people and activities but flat without a whole lot of dimension or feeling.<br /><br />Covering the 13 years of early 20th century history from 1911 to 1924, the \\"Fall of Giants\\" is the first book in what Follett is calling the \\"Century Trilogy.\\"<br /><br />In hard cover, the first installment is a 1,000-page brick. On the Kindle its file size is 1425 kilobytes or 16,566 \\"locations.\\" It's also, despite its length, a fast read and a fully realized work of fiction that evokes a world view in turbulent new century.<br /><br />It follows members of five families - Welsh, Russian, German, English and American - during the extraordinary events before, during and after WWI when U. S. President Woodrow Wilson attempts to build a lasting peace based on his Fourteen Points.<br /><br />The story follows the five families and all segments of society and cultures they represent as they make war, fight social and political causes and find love and forge loyalties that transcend military borders or national allegiances.<br /><br />Follett has the time and pages to fully develop many social and political themes: the role of trade unions, rights of women, the responsibility monarchies have in the modern world and the Russian revolution.<br /><br />Everyone who has read Richard Llewellyn's \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" with pleasure will be grabbed early by the opening chapters, which follow William Williams (\\"Billy Twice\\"), who celebrates his 13th birthday on June 22, 1911 as book opens. He also experiences his first day in the Welsh mine, a mile underground in the dark and muck as a new, unbroken collier's assistant.<br /><br />From the mines of Aberowen, South Wales, the story branches out to Ty Gwyn, the nearby country estate of the Earl Fitzherbert, 28, known as the ninth richest man in Britain. King George V is planning a visit to Ty Gwyn for what amounts to an international summit involving the brightest minds from Britain, the Continent and America. The major cast members assemble. National agendas are put forth and positions debated.<br /><br />Follett, as he did in \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End,\\" develops believable, full-rounded characters that earn our empathy and understanding despite their shortcomings. The front papers contains a listing of more than 125 characters. But the people are believable and real enough that keeping them separate is not a problem.<br /><br />Novels and historical novels in particular run the risk of becoming didactic and from time to time a passage will read like classroom lecture. Here's one: \\"Billy had been surprised to discover that the ground beneath him consisted of layers of different kinds of earth, like a stack of sandwiches. A coal seam was . . . one such layer. He had also been told that coal was made of dead leaves and other vegetable matter accumulated over thousands of years and compressed by the weight of earth above it.\\"<br /><br />Now you know about coal formation. Follett inserts the instructional passages sparingly.<br /><br />There are a number of beautifully evocative scenes. Some as short and simple as watching a toddler learn to throw a ball.<br /><br />There are many long vignettes that leave a lasting impression. Here are the opening lines in a moving description of the Christmas Truce that took place in no-man's land on the Western Front in 1914: \\"The German line, four hundred yards away, was hidden by a morning mist the same color as the German uniforms, a faded sliver-blue called field gray. Fitz heard faint music: the Germans were singing carols. Fitz was not very musical, but he thought he recognized \\"Silent Night.\\"<br/><br />The Battle of the Somme, which resulted in more than a million casualties, is fully rendered in all its mud and senseless carnage and, to my mind, stands up in comparison with the great battle scenes in \\"War and Peace.\\"<br /><br />Walter von Ulrich, a German military attach&eacute; at the German embassy in London, often feels as if his father Otto, a diplomat and confidante to the Kaiser, is talking to him as he were still twelve years old. It immediately occurred to me that Walter was right. Moreover, all the information being presented whether by a character or by the narrator was delivered at a level easily understood by any sixth grader with a normal sense of the world and its history.<br /><br />The younger von Ulrich feels, somewhat haughtily, talked down to. The reader on the other hand ends up being informed and provided with context in a manner that makes the important events of the last century easier to understand and comprehend.<br /><br />An immense amount of research has gone into the book. Follett manages to keep the narrative moving manner that keeps things simple and the pieces all arranged without the storyline becoming simplistic or superficial.<br /><br />Follett is expert at driving a good story while presenting the complexity of global events in a rich, compelling and easily comprehensible manner. It's my guess that if pick up book one, you'll be hooked for the trilogy.in all its mud and senseless carnage and, to my mind, stands up in comparison with the great battle scenes in \\"War and Peace.\\"     Walter von Ulrich, a German military attaché at the German embassy in London, often feels as if his father Otto, a diplomat and confidante to the Kaiser, is talking to him as he were still twelve years old.

This think is certainly well made and hefty, but I find it clunky and unwieldy.  In my survival pack I have a $10 folding saw that is 10x easier to use for cutting wood and really light.  I have a small thin fixed blade that has much more finesse for the 99% of typical knife tasks.    IF you want a knife that feels like a tire iron, and you plan on hammering it through steel doors, this is the one for you!!
B003O3EKHE|5.0|Billy Elliot encompasses the range of human emotions, a significant period in modern history, cultural accuracy, music, ballet and a triumphant ending.  The actors are extraordinary, especially the 11 year old lead actor.  I saw Billy Elliot on television recently and was so moved by it that I ordered it on Amazon.  It is the first movie I have not only wanted to see more than once, but actually purchased the DVD.  Of everyone I know who has seen this film, they all absolutely loved it.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|One would think that a movie made by a director whose previous movie (The sea inside) won the Oscar, that features in the main role a well-known actress who recently also won an Oscar (Rachel Weisz, 2005 Academy award winner for \\"The constant gardener\\"), which is spoken in English (no need for subtitles), and that required a considerable production effort ($ 70 million), would at least been released in theaters in the USA. Not so. Agora was actually released in the American movie theaters, but only in a pitifully small number of them. At the \\"peak\\" of that release, it was shown in exactly SEVENTEEN screens in all of the US. Seventeen. They might as well not release it at all.  Fortunately, it has now been released in DVD and Blu-ray. Do yourself a favor and don't miss it. It's well-made, well-acted, and above all it's based on a powerful and interesting TRUE story which, though uncomfortable to some modern hard-line religious believers, is well worth watching.

0316098337|5.0|I started The Room with a few reservations given the backdrop of the story...of a young woman being kidnapped and held captive...but I am really glad I read it.  Touching, beautifully written..exposing the sinister and the vulnerable both exquisitely.  I fell in love with Jack and his innocence and with Ma for her courage.  The book is about the love of a mother for her child and how the child's whole world is his mother. And how complete his childhood is in that one room...with his mother's love.  Emma Donoghue's concept of motherhood is heart rending and what I would aspire to be.  This book has made me think hard about my relationship with my two sons...aged 3 and 1 year...for better.  I feel I am a better person for having read it.  And if you think things like this don't happen in real life just google Josef Fritzel...
1594202842|1.0|Wow, what a disgusting screed this book is. The image of parenting this \\"book\\" presents us with is one-sided, narcissistic, intolerant, violent and self-edifying - at best! Your children are not dogs, they are human beings who need to be fostered into whatever they will become - ON THEIR OWN. You cannot forcibly create their identities for them, for such an approach will only manifest itself to your poor child as oppression -  no matter how hard you try to channel their lives, to mold them to YOUR own will, they will always dream of liberation. They will hate you, and in turn be wounded people, and perhaps unable to parent children themselves. To treat a child this way is for your own glory, your own sake, and not theirs. Only in a culture where individuals conceive of themselves as consumers, perpetually demanding to \\"have it their way,\\" would such a despicable screed as this catch on, a nation of conceited and lazy and emotionally retarded mothers who will do anything to feel like they can regain some sort of agency in their household, that they are the STAR of this exchange, that parenting is all about ME ME ME.     I for one cannot believe these people, Chua and her husband, are involved in the Ivy League - such cultural and racial materialism as she exhibits is not, as she thinks, respectful or a testament to her heritage as a (self-proclaimed) Chinese, but a vile and wrong-headed fetishization and a mere ruse to absolve her self-absorbed behavior. In fact, dispositions such as hers are what make the world such a hard place at times to inhabit; she represents one of the worst and most intolerant strains of our society, not to mention of parenting, that is, self-aggrandizing, hypocritical, opinionated.     Yeah, parenting has changed because we can afford to treat our children with love and respect; the strict \\"style\\" of \\"parenting\\" Chua preaches, as infusing your children with the ability to succeed in the world and be independent, is in fact not in response toan authentic need to stay afloat in hard economic climate, but a camouflaged desire for the narcissistic parent to dominate their children; what once may have been a legitimate, inasmuch as it was necessary, way of raising your kids, a way that whole generations of future parents would try to spare their own children from having to go through by showering them with unconditional love - what was necessary in, say, the Great Depression years is, in Chua's book, gratuitous and cruel, and serves only to edify the parent's own wants and needs.    You are not the architect of your children. I am optimistic because I know most people will see through her gimmicks and recognize how repugnant this all is - those who will fall for it are those parents who already have the capacity to harm their children emotionally, and will only continue to do so, if they attempt to implement any of these suggested \\"techniques.\\" Pushing your children to be the best they can be does not mean shoving things down their throats, so to speak. To reiterate - your children are not dogs, to be taught tricks and punished when failing to perform. You need to help them to cultivate THEIR OWN - that is, APART FROM YOU - likes and dislikes, their OWN dreams, while nevertheless helping them become aware of what it all means in relation to themselves and their station in the world. If they don't like violin or math, they don't have to. The fact that you force your children to play musical instruments, etc, betrays a petty desire for status and affluence, and grooming your children for economic success - as if that where the only thing worth achieving, the highest and only worthwhile or possible end! - is a poor excuse for self-development. As I said, they'll be able to \\"ace\\" the SATS and play a few songs on the violin, but will they be emotionally competent people? No. Will they have a hard time understanding why they feel so empty and unhappy as they get older? YES. Because you made it virtually impossible for them to get to know themselves, as you forced YOUR OWN version on them, brutalized them into becoming someone they would not have necessarily been otherwise.     AT ANY RATE, please, listen to your heart, and do not harm your children for your own sake. To be a parent means to be selfless.
1599218011|4.0|This book is great if you are totally brand new to a whole foods vegan diet.  She covers everything you need to know in a sample and fun way (though some times the sarcastic humor and silly lines got annoying).  However, if you are already used to this way of eating or at least have researched it before, there is absolutely nothing new here.  I've been a vegetarian for 8 years now and have read a lot about whole foods eating and I found myself skipping over half the book because it was already information that's been out there for a long time.  But again if you are new to this and are on a SAD diet then this book is great.  I wish the 21 day cleanse gave more direction on what to eat for the entire 21 days though.  Yes, I already know what to eat but still on a cleanse it's more motivating and easier to stick with it if you have a plan written out...so it will take a little initiative on your part.  If you are looking for an honest to goodness book about vegan whole foods I'd highly recommend Alicia Silverstone's The Kind Diet book much better.

Usually my daughter gets bored with a movie and wants to change seats and go up and down the steps...not this time!  She sat and watched the whole thing with me!  We had many laugh out loud moments while watching.  I would recommend TANGLED to everyone.  You'll be glad you did! Great job Disney!

B000EXZI0A|4.0|When I think of Punk I think of a rock' n 'roll genre that become big in the mid-late 1970s, and the first band that comes to my mind when I think of Punk is The Ramones before any other. To me The Ramones define Punk and represent what it should be along with a few others such as Iggy Pop, The Sex Pistols and The Clash. Punk is a genre that was all about raw power, desire to play and more often than not Punk musicians were not all that talented (and in some cases fairly mediocre).  I will admit that I was never the biggest Punk fan but it's just unfortunate how this great band from New York never really got the recognition they deserve (but it seems they have become more popular in recent years) as they have been really influential without ever being really popular. It's worth nothing that naming a Ramones compilation \\"Greatest Hits\\" is considered inaccurate among fans of the band, The Ramones never had any \\"Hits\\" and they have spend their entire career in the underground overshadowed by other bands, unknown by many and simply ignored by critics. Let's face this greatest hits collection (and just about any other greatest hits album) is for the casual fans who only want a few hits or perhaps look at those collections as a way to get into a band, to figure out if they want more of the band.<br /><br />Some people will be satisfied with such a collection and those 20 songs here may do that for them.  The songs everyone expects to be on a Ramones best of album are here: Blitzkrieg Bop, I Wanna Be Sedated, Sheena Is a Punk Rocker, Rock'N'Roll High School, Pet Sematary etc. For the most part I'm satisfied with the material included, I believe those 20 songs serve as a good introduction to this great and TRUE Punk band, there's not much to complain about really. To me it represents the band correctly it has their fast hard driving songs like \\"Blitzkrieg\\" and \\"Warthog\\" along the more subtle and melodic \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" and \\"I Just Wanna Have Something to Do\\", the catchy . It's worth noting that the band's song were usually pretty short which explains why they fit as much song as they did on this disc. The hardcore fans would probably have added and replaced some songs but for the most part, someone relatively new to the band will like this compilation. If you're looking to get into the band or want to add this great band to your musical collection Greatest Hits is an excellent way to do so. However if you're looking for something a little more comprehensive the anthology album or even Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits (which has ten more songs)may be more of what you're looking for. The Ramones certainly do have their hardcore fans but many will be fine with a hits album without needing much more if anything else at all. Those 20 songs make for an interesting collection of Ramones songs and one that casual fans are likely to enjoy. I honestly believe that if these 20 songs aren't enough to get you into this great band then you likely never will. 4/5.y .

0307272702|5.0|I would rank this book as one of the best in the area of weight loss. This book is not about opinions it simply tries to report the facts. The author contends that the medical orthodoxy is incorrect. Low fat, high carbohydrate diets cause weight gain not prevent it. He sites many studies completed using different types of diets along with the results in the general population's obesity epidemic since the famous high carbohydrate food pyramid has been adopted. In his book he shows numerous examples that historically people believed that highly refined carbohydrates were fattening, not meat and fat. There were low carb diet books written in the 19th century that were hugely successful. He shows how health authorities try to simplify losing weight with the calories in, calories out theory and exercise. They ignore the importance of the effects that hormones have on the body. They do not even consider the effects of the fat storing hormone insulin when the body releases it to bring down blood glucose levels by storing excess calories in fat cells. The point of the book is that protein and fat do not make us fat-only carbohydrates do-so there is no reason to curtail them. Our genetics determine our ability to process carbs and how our body reacts to them and stores fat. The author contends that people do not cause themselves to be overweight by being lazy and overeating, they overeat and become inactive because they are overweight. He gives proofs of genetic fatness in animal breeding and how identical twins have the same body type.  As we age we are much more susceptible to weight gain because of the decrease in estrogen and testosterone. However, the fewer carbohydrates we consume, the leaner we will be. Over consuming carbohydrates causes or body to burn glucose for energy instead of fatty acids in fat cells. These are the facts as proposed by the author.<br />  I have read over 80 books on weight loss and nutrition and battled with my weight several times. I have tried most diet plans and strategies and the only thing that has worked for me is carbohydrate restriction. The book explains that different people have different tolerances for how many carbs they can consume with out weight gain. I have found everything the author writes about in this book to be true in my own experiences. I highly recommend this book if you want to be successful in weight loss. I lost 50 pounds twice using these strategies and kept it off for years both times. It is when I stray from these principles that I start gaining weight back. Also as I age I can tolerate less and less carbohydrates before I start gaining weight.<br /><br />This book could also be called \\"Why Low Carb Diets Work.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mastering the Zone\\" by Barry Sears is the diet book that changed my life and finally showed me how to eat to lose weight.most diet plans and strategies and the only thing that has worked for me is carbohydrate restriction.

B002I9Z89Y|5.0|Star Trek fans can be a picky bunch, and I reference the mixed reaction to the reboot film as an example. However, I can't imagine that any fan would approach this Blu-ray set with anything but enthusiasm and grateful anticipation. As I said in my title, the shows have never looked better, including in their original broadcasts on NBC. The restoration process for this presentation was performed with reverence from the original film negatives. Defects in the picture due to tears, stains, and other causes were painstaking cleaned up after the scan to digital files. Colors and contrasts were adjusted correctly. Even the famous theme music was rerecorded using the original arrangement and an orchestra of the correct size and mix of instruments.<br /><br />I like to let people know in my reviews of Star Trek products that I watched, with eagerness, the first episode broadcast. Back in those days networks sometimes did what they called a \\"sneak preview\\" week. Each fall the premier week for new series was more of a big deal than it is today, because you only had three networks and limited choices. For a kid, in particular, it was always an exciting time of promise and adventure. I never felt that more than in 1966 when I saw the lead up commercials for Star Trek. The \\"Sneak Preview\\" week was just a tactic to try to get in ahead of the other networks, but they were all three quickly doing it. I had just started to become interested in science fiction, having recently read my first science fiction book (Robert Heinlein's \\"The Star Beast\\"). When I finally saw the Star Trek's 'sneak preview' episode, \\"The Man Trap\\", at first it was a bit disorienting for a 9 year old. I thought maybe the bridge was the only working area of the space ship, for example. LOL As the series progressed, though, I quickly caught on. I loved every minute of Star Trek I could watch, and that has pretty much remained true now for 44 years.<br /><br />In making a Blu-ray presentation of the Star Trek series, the producers of this product knew they had an issue to resolve. Although the resolution of the live action scenes was more than sufficient to create high definition images, the special effects shots just were not on the same scale. So they took the amazing action of recreating the effects shots. I'll have to say, they did a great job of it too. For purists, the original effects shots are also included ... in fact you can skip back and forth between the two sets of shots 'on the fly' as you watch an episode! However, a lot of thought went into the creation of the new effects. They are a distinct improvement over what the original production crew was able to do with the limited budget and technology available during the show's production. I only wish Roddenberry could have seen the results of this work. It is precisely what he would have done in the 1960s had he the means to do so.<br /><br />Season Two continued the great writing and ground breaking stories that marked many Season One episodes. Show for show, it may well be the strongest of the three years. A few highlights:<br /><br />* Amok Time: gives us our first real look at Vulcan culture outside of Spock's (almost) stoic demeanor. We learn about Pon-far.<br /><br />* The Changeling: Mostly notable as the show that Alan Dean Foster stole his ideas for when he authored the story for the first motion picture.<br /><br />* Mirror, Mirror: an extremely interesting episode where Kirk, Uhura, and Scotty are transposed with their evil counterparts from an alternate universe. This show was the inspiration for several DS9 episodes and a truly fun two-parter near the end of the \\"Enterprise\\" run.<br /><br />* The Doomsday Machine: One of the infrequent looks at another Constitution class starship. It introduces (and bids farewell to) Commodore Decker, father of the new Enterprise Captain in the first movie.<br /><br />* Catspaw: a spooky and fun Halloween episode (broadcast on October 27).<br /><br />* I, Mudd: Veryamusing episode where Harry Mudd and a planet full of androids plot to take over the Enterprise.<br /><br />* Journey to Babel: Here we meet Tellurites and Andorians, and Spock's parents! Sarek would become a famous character despite only appearing in this one episode (until Next Generation, that is).<br /><br />* Wolf in the Fold: Scotty is accused of murder when a murderous entity possesses him, and others.<br /><br />* The Trouble with Tribbles: One of the funniest of the Star Trek comedies, and possibly the most famous episode at this point in time. This set takes that extraordinary step of including the animated series sequel to this episode, and also the DS9 tribute episode that brilliantly puts DS9 cast right into the middle of the 1967 show. Fantastic stuff!!!<br /><br />* A Piece of the Action: Another comedy as Kirk and Spock go gangster.<br /><br />* Bread and Circuses: A fun take on a planet with parallel development to our own ... at least until the Roman Empire stayed on for good.<br /><br />* Assignment Earth: This was a pilot episode wedged into a Star Trek Episode. Robert Lansing and Terri Garr make this one fun to watch.<br /><br />I tried to be at least a little picky here, and I was tempted to list many other episodes from this season. There were 26, and great entertainment one and all.<br /><br />If you're a Star Trek fan still without a Blu-ray player ... well ... this gives you a great excuse to get into Blu-ray and hi-def. Luckily the road is paved and Blu-ray players now cost what had at one time become common (and low) prices for DVD players. Even HD TVs are a fraction of what they once cost.

B004EC5IUW|4.0|How anybody can see any Japanese Animé dubbed into poor English is beyond me. Just watch the subbed version to get the full effect, the nuances, the subtlety. The dubbed version is as poor and dead-flat sounding as ever. At least, if you watch the subbed version and you miss some of the picture due to all the reading that you have to do - hey, you can watch it again and again!!!! Otherwise, the transfer is excellent, and the film MUST be watched on Blu-Ray, there is no other way.
B00406UK7S|3.0|\\"Centurion\\" is what is called a \\"hack and slash\\" film from Neil Marshall, director of \\"Dog Soldiers\\" and \\"The Descent,\\" which means there are lots of gores, mutilated limbs and dead bodies. Blending raw violence and beautiful landscapes, \\"Centurion\\" has a potential for a sweeping saga with action, history and romance, but somehow the film itself, though it is not bad, ends up with dissatisfaction because of the generic storytelling and flat characters.    Set in the second century Britain, a band of Roman soldiers is left behind the enemy lines after the surprise attack from the Pictish warriors. Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), who had survived the Pictish raid on the Roman frontier fort, is entrusted by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) of the Ninth Legion with the task of bringing the six survivors back to safety.     Michael Fassbender is as brilliant as ever though his heroic character (and the romantic subplot) is underwritten. Olga Kurylenko appears as a fearsome warrior riding on a horse (and she doesn't speak a single word). She is not bad, but those who expect her to play another sexy \\"Bond Girl\\" as in \\"Quantum of Solace\\" might be disappointed.     For me, the biggest problem with the film is that though \\"Centurion\\" delivers a few thrilling action scenes, the story itself is not that thrilling. We see a group of characters chased by another group of characters, but the chase scenes drag on, are at times repetitious, sometimes even look as if borrowed from somewhere else, like \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\\"    \\"Centurion\\" is a blood-soaked period action that could have been better with fleshed-out characters and a tighter story.

1401207529|4.0|Batman: Year One is a masterpiece. Frank Miller has a talent for writing, no one can deny that, but sometimes he wastes it (All-Star Batman & Robin, The Boy Wonder). However, this is not one of those times. Batman Year One is a bold new look at the origins of the Dark Knight, and how he came to be. The gritty story is illustrated by David Mazzucchelli, who designed the artwork to resemble a more pulp magazine look, which is how the Caped Crusader started out. I would recommend Batman Year One to those who love graphic novels, action stories, old pulp, and particularly, Batman.

B000JMKQX0|2.0|The plot for World War Z is a great idea, but the book doesn't take advantage of presenting that plot by using historical interviews.  This book would have been awesome if Brooks had revealed the plot through several people currently living the experience.  Instead the author just gives a historical account of what happened through a lot of interviews with survivors.  For me the result was like watching a documentary on PBS.  The entire war lost its excitement, because I pretty much knew what happened and so the interviews were not very suspenseful.  They were just informative.  I got about half way through the book before I set it down.  I just lost interest.
B0021L8V0W|3.0|This movie has plenty of action, stunts, and special effects, and the acting is generally pretty good, so it's reasonably entertaining.  However, the characters and plot stretch believability past the breaking point, with the result that I didn't find this movie very engaging and it left little impression on me when it was over.  I suppose I can recommend this movie to people who are in the mood for it, but there are definitely better movies available in this genre, so this isn't a top choice (despite having Angelina Jolie in the lead role).

I have read almost all of her books and this one is above and beyond all the rest.  I have never written a review before but really wanted to for this book. It is a wonderful story, full of characters that are believable and outstanding and has the suspense and the love and it is the book you never want to put down. I loved it!  If anyone out there loves dogs, it is a must read!!! Her knowledge and obviously love of dogs is endearing. It is not just a love story, this book has a wonderful plot and is definitely a keeper!!!  Thank you Nora Roberts and please keep these kind of books coming!!!!

B002VPE1WK|4.0|I've used this bag for about two months. Basically, I like it pretty well. The interior is padded just about right, and there are lots of little compartments (which can be customized) that hold my camera, a few lenses and other assorted gizmos. The zippers work very smoothly, and it's very easy to pop my camera in and out whenever I need it.    But one of the straps has now started to come apart at the seam where it connects with the bag. I've filled the bag with gear, but certainly not overstuffed it. So it's disappointing that the manufacturing quality isn't what it should be. However, for the price I still think this is a decent choice.

B0034G4OUO|4.0|Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson has no real name in this movie, just his occupation: Driver.  Similarly, Billy Bob Thornton is \\"Cop.\\"  That must have been difficult to come up with.  A completely unnecessary third-wheel-subplot is present, showing off a millionaire software developer assassin who has mastered yoga (seriously) and gets to shag Maggie Grace - whose role as hot girlfriend is so pointless it should have been uncredited - is hardly worth mentioning.<br /><br />After being released from prison, Driver jumps in the car set up by a P.I. acquaintance of his, drives to a local telemarketing office, and sprays some nerd's brain matter on the back of his cubicle.  If there is a better way to get me on the side of a guy embarking on a cross-country, revenge-filled murdering spree - which is tracked by Cop and his partner Cop with Breasts (Carla Gugino) - then I don't know of it; because everyone hates telemarketers.  Through flashbacks we learn that Driver's brother (and crew) were involved in a bank heist and later murdered for their score.  Up next: Death Wish Johnson!<br /><br />Flaws in character development abound, as very little is learned about Driver, but a ton of time is spent on Billy Bob's failed marriage, portly kid, and drug problem.  Each of the characters is transparently established as flawed, and the certainty of their eventual revelation makes tomorrow's sunrise doubtful.  The cinematography and limited special effects are both unremarkable.  Acting-wise, this film has the gusto of a professional cast already reading their next script; it never reaches the crescendo of expected excitement.  Evidently two decent car chases and a few head shots just wasn't enough to get the cast fully enthralled either.  I will say, however, that Johnson definitely steps outside his comfort zone, displaying what appeared to be genuine vulnerability to pair with already mastered anger.<br /><br />While disappointing, Faster is nonetheless in my beloved \\"Death Wish,\\" screw with me and I'll kill everyone you know, category.  So, for that, it gets extra points.  Besides all that, I'm for any opportunity that keeps the Rock out of family films or a fairy costume.ew with me and I'll kill everyone you know, category.

0316067938|2.0|The Twilight series is full of action, romance, and drama.  The books are exciting and extremely entertaining to read.  In my opinion, the characters are very vivid and I can clearly see their roll in the story and what they are really about.  But, the last book in the series I think crossed a line.  Although it was still a very exciting and vivid book to read it has too much adult content.  This series is about and for young adults and the content of this book was not directed towards them as a group.  It explained in great detail and very graphicly how she becomes a vampire and it also explains in great detail Bella and Edwards wedding night.  I think that this story could have been told in a more appropriate and different way that would have been better for young teens and pre-teens to read.  These subjects are not ones that I think we should be exposing them to.
B0032JTV6U|3.0|I love the show but the quality of the DVDs are sub-par. I haven't noticed the sync-ing issues but I will definitely take a look at that as I am sure I will be watching the season over again.     My issue is with DVD #6. The second episode on the disk \\"Dream On\\" skipped multiple times and the last episode \\"Theatricality\\" completely froze at 5:39. It took over 10 minutes to unfreeze; the time on the Blu-ray player counter was jumping between 5:39 and 8 minutes and change until it unfroze. The freezing continued throughout the first 15 minutes of the episode. After that the episode was fine. I checked the disk and there are no scratches on it.
0553805371|2.0|It is hard to know who does the writing, to avoid the feeling of disingenuousness, and to appreciate the joy the author(s) expect to attain by reaching their Holy Grail. They dismiss philosophy as dead, perhaps bask too much in their own brilliance, and seem naive about their dismissal of purpose. Maybe all that truth has going for it is that it bears some resemblance to reality, but the reality these two strive for leaves me discouraged and uninspired.

B002M2N9JI|5.0|LA Roux's self titled album hits you with left field set up of voice and lyrics that are rhythmatically engineered to win your heart.  Good for that dance floor craziness or a cool melt down over an icy snow cone.  She demands your affection by being all so expressive, but disguises her need to love hard.  If you've ever felt like going all the way without the commitment, then you will be able to  relate to these lines.  Tell all verses ring out the obvious put on of a strong front that's clearly centered in lots of love. A heartfelt voice that's blazing hot different.

It is right up there with the Bruce Lee collection and I can see where IP man style and techniques helped propel Bruce Lee to the kind of status that all fans of the martial arts can be proud of watching over and over again.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|Just read it in one sitting and really enjoyed it. While Ms Chua's views are extreme, she demonstrated humility and personal growth along the way. I laughed out loud many times as Ms Chua poked fun at herself and situations she found herself in. As a first generation Asian American, I can relate to the authors parental and family values. While I have no plans to be as extreme as Ms Chua in her quest for excellence from her daughters, this book has certainly caused me to pause to question whether I am pushing my own daughter hard enough to realize her full potential. I appreciate Ms Chua for raising this topic and for creating the debate.
B00003CXXM|1.0|OK, first off the story-line of this movie is good, but it winds up being a piece of trash and ruined, and I mean the bottom of the trash heap for the following reasons<br />1.Matt Damon just doesnt cut it as a bad-ass<br />2.\\"Matrix\\" style fighting sequences just dont go with this movie<br />3.Its a Spy/Action movie..I understand that there are going to be things pulled off that are un-realistic..and thats cool...I like movies like James Bond, Rambo, XXX, The Matrix, Expendables, and Crank..but watching Matt Damon fighting sequences are about as un-real as it can get..come on..disarming like 3people in 2 seconds, then kicking the crap out of another 2 in another 5sec...wow<br />I have nothing against Matt Damon..Great Actor...just not fit for this role..he's not a tough guy..and that what these movie wants us to believe, and since it is actually meant to have a story (which is does) its way 2 over the top with action that belongs in ps3 video games or movies like Crank..just not here...Alot of people liked it...and its spawned 2 sequals, which surprised the hell out of me..i just didnt buy into the hype

B002VKE0XA|4.0|\\"Paranormal Activity\\" is a poster child for the democratization of media.  More importantly, this film shows that you can make a solid 3-4 star movie with almost no money, as long as you have a competent script and competent actors.  Both of those factors are present here.  The script isn't brilliant, but it makes sense, and doesn't have any glaring holes.  The bare-bones cast (who, according to one source, was found via a Craigslist ad and paid $500 each) were competent actors who fit the material.  Hollywood polish and glam wouldn't have fit into this movie anyway.  Finally, the production design took the limitations of the budget and crew (for example, lots of static camera) and made them into integral parts of the movie.  I wish that Hollywood would finally learn that thinking and advance planning make a better movie that tons of money and fixing things in post.<br /><br />This isn't brilliant; it's not gory; and it's not the best thing you'll ever see.  What \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is is a solid movie that will unsettle you a little, capture your attention, and entertain you for 90 minutes in a better way than a lot of other things you'll see this year.  This is at least worth a rent.

0312600844|4.0|When I was at the halfway point of this book, I still wasn't sure if I liked it or not. It felt dense and depressing, and I wasn't liking the characters all that much. But when I got two-thirds of the way through, the book--and the characters--started to grow on me. And, as I came to the end, I found myself weeping and filled with admiration for Franzen. By the end, I cared deeply for these characters--these flawed people who are trying their damnedest to make a connection and screwing it up over and over.<br /><br />But let's start at the beginning. This is book about a marriage--specifically the flawed and very f$%ked up marriage of Walter and Patty Berglund. We first glimpse the Berglunds through the eyes of their Minnesota neighbors. Patty, former college athlete and now a stay-at-home mom, is envied and liked, yet she tends to alienate people. Walter, too nice to dislike, is truly her better half. We get a peek into some of the issues that the Berglund family is facing--with the biggest scandal being the rebellion of their 16-year-old son Joey, who chooses to leave the family home to live with the next-door neighbors.<br /><br />From there, we read Patty Berglund's autobiography, suitably entitled \\"Mistakes Were Made.\\" Written as a therapeutic exercise during a bout of depression, we get Patty's view of her childhood and her courtship with Walter. It is in this document that we learn of a critical third party in the Berglund marriage--musician Richard Katz, who is both Walter's best friend and Patty's (somewhat) unrequited love interest.<br /><br />We then get into Walter's head (as he fights his growing discontent with Patty), Richard's head (as he struggles with his loyalty to Walter and his attraction to Patty), and Joey's head (as he struggles to break free from his mother, earn his father's respect, and become his own person despite the all-encompassing love/albatross of his girlfriend Connie.) Then, when things blow up and fall apart, we revisit Patty as she continues her autobiography. Finally, coming full circle, we glimpse the Berglunds through the eyes of new Minnesota neighbors--and these Berglunds are very very different from the couple we met at the start of the book.<br /><br />This structure makes for an interesting reading experience. We view each character through several prisms. Patty seen through her eyes is different from the Patty we see through Richard, Walter and Joey's eyes. As we experiences the Berglund's marriage, I found myself continually changing my feelings about each character. Midway through, I was discussing the book with Sandy of You've GOTTA Read This! and she wrote: \\"I thought the characters were just a freaking mess.  I would have paid money to lock their asses up in a room together just to see who would come out alive.  And I often felt slimy after I'd spent some time with them.\\"  I agree with this sentiment, but, as I continued to read, I began to soften towards them ... to almost love them. Yes, they are flawed. Yes, they make mistakes. But isn't this more realistic and truthful? Although I like to pretend otherwise, I'm more like Patty Berglund than I'd like to admit. Her struggle to be a better person is one to which I could often relate. Her belated realization that love was always right there in front of her was a revelation ... and one that was rendered so realistically and truthfully that it cut to the core of my heart.<br /><br />When I read Franzen's previous novel,  The Corrections, I remember feeling alienated from it. Part of it could have been that I wasn't \\"ready\\" for a novel like that. It could also be that Franzen meant you to feel alienated. (My memory of the book is a bit hazy now ... some eight years on.) At first, I was feeling the same way with Freedom. It has been heralded as An Important Book. And, like so many other Important Books, I was finding it hard to find my way to its heart. It wasn't because Franzen's writing is inaccessible; it just felt distant andcold. But, the more I read, the more involved I got. For me, the moment when I \\"crossed over\\" was when Walter experiences some moments of freedom toward the end of the book.  At that point, I was invested and involved--and when Franzen rips out Walter's heart, he ripped out mine too.<br /><br />Aside from the examination of the Berglund's marriage, Franzen also uses Freedom to comment on modern American life--making statements (both overtly and covertly) about  9/11, the Iraq War, consumerism, environmental issues, overpopulation, music and celebrity. These social and political issues didn't feel disingenuous to me,  and I never felt like Franzen was getting up on a soapbox at the expense of the story. For me, it made the book more grounded and current. This isn't a book that takes place in some nebulous timeframe; parts of it take place specifically during 9/11 and the subsequent Iraq war. You know that because the characters deal with those issues (and the other mentioned above) directly and in a hands-on way. I'm sure some readers will be turned off by this aspect of the book, but I found it involving and interesting.<br /><br />Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Franzen's writing. He has been billed as one of our most important modern novelists, and I wouldn't disagree with that. I marked quite a few phrases and paragraphs that really spoke to me, and I thought I'd excerpt some here.<br /><br />  \\"She was like an imaginary friend who happened to be visible.\\"<br /><br />  \\"He was beginning to see, as he hadn't in St. Paul, that things' prices weren't always evident at first glance: that the really big ballooning of the interest charges on his high-school pleasures might still lie ahead of him.\\"<br /><br />  \\"At the Days Inn in Beckley, they fitted identical keycards into identical doors, fifteen feet from each other, and entered rooms whose identical profound sadness only a torrid illicit liaison could have overcome.\\"<br /><br />  \\"And she knew better than to stab at an existing wound twice, but either she was the world's most expert implier, or Joey was the world's most sensitive inferrer. She had to merely mention an upcoming visit from her old teammate Cathy Schmidt for Joey to hear invidious criticism of Connie.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Mercifully, the ring turned up in the second of the turds he broke apart. A hardness amid softness, a clean circle within chaos.\\"<br /><br />  \\"The Dent and Dolberg houses were standing empty now, their windows darkened like the call-holding lights of emergency-hotline callers who'd finally quietly hung up....\\"<br /><br />Freedom isn't an easy read won't be a good fit for everyone. You might find yourself halfway through and considering giving up. You may wonder \\"Why am I reading about these horrid people?\\" But I urge you to read on. I was on the fence for a good majority of the book (and for a 562-page book, that is a long time). But, in the end, I came to love this book and its flawed characters. I got involved and was moved.

0307949486|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first book in the Millenium Trilogy. An elderly father is tortured by flowers mailed to him every year on the birthday of his missing daughter and the police seem helpless about finding out what exactly happened. He recruits a disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist to help solve the puzzle. A key helper, Lisbeth Salander, is a bright young woman, toughened by institutional rape and abuse, who helps with research and with putting the pieces together.<br /><br />This is a roughly written thriller but many in the West have found it a fresh entrant in the genre. Many have also enjoyed a new look at Scandinavia and its problems. The trilogy continues with The Girl Who Played with Fire.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|Five members of a CIA black ops team are betrayed after they refuse to obey an order because it would have involved the murder of women and children. Someone arranges for them to be killed. There is an explosion, the children are killed, and the news is circulated that the team acted improperly and are dead. Now they want revenge, to clear their names, and be able to return home. Four of the men act in a silly fashion and are apparently not too bright. Their leader, a colonel, seems intelligent. The dialogue is frequently childish, such as: \\"What is the password?\\" Answer: \\"Open the door or I'll kill you.\\" And, when one of the five is shot in both legs, the other asks: \\"Can you stand?\\" The story is very similar to the A-Team movie, but sillier, but filled with lots of action.<br /><br /> They team up with a woman who agrees to help them return to the US if they help her capture Max. We do not know if she is telling the colonel the truth and if Max is involved with their attempted murder. Will the team be able to rehabilitate themselves, or will they fail to do so, as the A-Team failed?

0385341008|4.0|I can't believe it's taken me this long to get around to this one. To be perfectly honest, I had little interest in it based solely on the title and the vast amount of love it got from, well, everyone. I can be truculent that way. But a sufficient amount of time has passed since the hubbub, that I was quite happy to see a copy show up among my Christmas presents and I opened it up with alacrity over the break. What a perfectly lovely book and how right everyone was talking it up here, there, and everywhere. I was intrigued to find out it was written by two women--relatives, no less. My understanding is that Mary Ann Shaffer asked her niece (and fellow writer) Annie Barrows to help her finish the book once Ms. Shaffer's failing health began to seriously impede its progress toward publication. I'm so glad the book was finished and published and not lost in the shuffle. I wonder, sometimes, how many gems are.<br /><br />The year is 1946 and Juliet Ashton is a columnist turned author struggling to write her second book, following her wildly successful compilation of wartime essays. Having just completed a rather grueling tour promoting the book, she is back in London and staring at the empty pages on her desk just waiting to be filled. Then she receives a letter from a man by the unlikely name of Dawsey Adams, wondering whether or not she might direct him to some further work by his beloved author Charles Lamb. You see, he purchased one of his own volumes of Lamb secondhand and it had Juliet's name inscribed inside. Juliet is charmed to find another Lamb admirer and immediately writes back to Mr. Adams. And thus begins an extensive and fruitful correspondence the likes of which neither of them have ever known. Dawsey belongs to an extremely unique literary society known as the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. The name alone whets Juliet's appetite for more. And it turns out there is so much more to this little Channel Island society than meets the eye. Inaugurated during the German occupation of Guernsey, this small group of ragtag members meets faithfully to discuss books and huddle together against the encroaching horrors of war. Through their experiences, Juliet's imagination is fired up and the novel she keeps trying and failing to write suddenly takes off.<br /><br />This is one of those books that drew my husband down the hall and into the room to find out what the laughter was about. And then, of course, the tears, when I foolishly attempted to read aloud an early passage that hit me in one of those wonderful zing moments. Try reading this portion aloud without choking up:<br /><br />***<br /><br />Best to say we weren't a true literary society at first. Aside from Elizabeth, Mrs. Maugery, and perhaps Booker, most of us hadn't had much to do with books since our school years. We took them from Mrs. Maugery's shelves fearful we'd spoil the fine papers. I had no zest for such matters in those days. It was only by fixing my mind on the Commandant and jail that I could make myself to lift up the cover of the book and begin.<br /><br />It was called Selections from Shakespeare. Later, I came to see that Mr. Dickens and Mr. Wordsworth were thinking of men like me when they wrote their words. But most of all, I believe that William Shakespeare was. Mind you, I cannot always make sense of what he says, but it will come.<br /><br />It seems to me the less he said, the more beauty he made. Do you know what sentence of his I admire the most? It is, \\"The bright day is done, and we are for the dark.\\"<br /><br />I wish I'd known those words on the day I watched those German troops land, plane-load after plane-load of them--and come off ships down in the harbor! All I could think of was damn them, damn them, over and over. If I could have thought the words \\"the bright day is done and we are for the dark,\\" I'd have been consoled somehow and ready to go out and contend with circumstance--instead of my heart sinking to my shoes.<br /><br />***<br /><br />It was just one of those moments in which the words--the whole sentiment--was just so right that, despite the fact that I'm not fictional, not a man, did not live during or anywhere near just after World War II, and have not had to watch my home invaded, I knew. The words of William Shakespeare connected us and I knew. Such moments are rare and beautiful in the fictional works I read and I treasure them up. As I said, I laughed innumerable times while reading THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY and I saw the events of the time period and place in an entirely new way. The book was so far from the precious and fluffy volume I was expecting that I wasn't completely prepared for how delightful and moving it would be. The history, the love story, the band of friends . . . it was magic. I am, and always have been, a fan of epistolary novels and it was a treat to sit back and let Juliet and Dawsey, Sidney and Isola recount the events and moments of their lives for me through the series of letters and journal entries that make up this remarkable story. I know the format bothers some readers, but for me the slight removal only serves to heighten my awareness of the characters and to underline the subtlety inherent in their private lives. I was won over by each one of them and suffice it to say that a particular scene at the end where a certain someone is on a ladder and another someone is spying through the window still brings a smile to my face and laughter to my lips.

B0021L8V0M|5.0|Well edited, fast flowing, almost believable, on the edge of capability for someone of Angelina's physical strenghts. Keeps you in the story and made me watch it several times to catch all the bits. You'll root for her......
B002ZG980U|3.0|I won't waste time dwelling on the plot. Bottom line? It's good. So good that I spent money (the real kind) on a disc, though I almost never do so; I'm not a movie buff.     I suppose they want to not-so-subtly encourage people to get the Blu-Ray. This disc is borderline bargain-bin material. The case is made of cheap, flimsy plastic and literally has a big recycle symbol on the inside, as if you're supposed to chuck it, rip the disc and move on. Don't get me wrong, recycling is cool, but this is a durable good, folks--very unlikely to find itself in a landfill any time soon.    It took a long time to load in VLC, which is extremely unusual, and I was afraid it had that awful variety of copy protection that locks out legitimate owners. It did load, though, and the first thing I noticed was the graininess--it's a standard definition image, marginally superior to a VHS. The second thing I noticed was the second level of black bar letterboxing. There's the normal first level put in by the player because my screen has a different aspect than the video--perfectly normal. Then, there's a different, grainier shade of black bordering the action, which makes me think that it's actually baked into the video and that if you were to hypothetically play it on a super-wide screen that matches the aspect of the feature (2.35:1, I think?), you'd actually see bars on all four sides of the screen. That's silly.     The icing on the cake is that the subtitles don't make use of this area at all; rather, they're on the bottom portion of the image in large bubble letters that are not only difficult to read, but obscure a large chunk of the action. It's as if the producers chose a font specifically engineered to be useless.    To be fair, a Hamilton isn't a bad price. Still, if I had bought the movie for anything other than the plot, I'd be returning it. If you're looking for the theatrical experience, get another edition. If you merely want some food for your imagination, this is where it's at.
0312600844|5.0|OK.  OK.  Literary community.  You win.  It was a Franzen throwdown and you emerged the victor.<br /><br />I had no doubt in my mind that I would not like this book.  Franzen is over-hyped and I didn't like The Corrections (at least, the 1/3 of it that I read.)  But there was this nagging voice in the back of my head that made me want to try it, and then I found out that the audio had gotten some acclaim so that was the route I chose.<br /><br />I'm so glad.  It was really a fantastic book.  It felt authentic and that these were real people - warts and all.  The writing, the pacing, the character development, the characters themselves - all deserving of praise.  (Yes, some of the environmental stuff went on a bit long, but it didn't detract for me.)<br /><br />The audio performance was outstanding, and added a level of depth to my experience of the book.  I felt an emotional connection that I'm not sure I would have felt otherwise.  It was like the narrator and I sat down, and he said ... Let me tell you about my friends, the Berglunds.  And we sat, and he talked, and I listened...enraptured.<br /><br />I found so much relatable in these characters.  I watched how they grew and changed, and I feel so many of these various evolutions in my own life.<br /><br />If you are looking to escape reality, this isn't the book for you.  It's left-leaning for certain.  If ignorance is bliss is your motto, give it a pass.  Otherwise, I highly recommend it.

Going on and on, raving about a poor rating for a stupid movie. Get a life!!      I ordered this item on 1/24/11.  About 15 minutes after I ordered it, Amazon lowered the price by $3.  I tried to cancel it and reorder, but the site had already locked me out. I figured I would be billed the current $12.99 that was advertised.  NOT SO, I was billed $15.99 and when I wrote to say that I thought I should get a $3 refund, I got a snotty little email back stating essentially that they didn't care if I went elsewhere to purchase my items, they were not refunding the difference.  I have spent thousands of dollars on Amazon in the past year, but being a good customer doesn't make any difference to them.  They don't care about you and don't let them tell you the do. They have now admitted that there is a pre order price quarantee, that the person responding to me was incorrect, and the $3 was atomatically refunded today.
B00004SZWD|5.0|My marching band played Sir Duke and I Wish for a halftime show last fall, and after that I was hooked, I absolutely had to dive deeper into the world of Stevie Wonder. I was not dissapointed. Such a beautiful masterpiece...Some favorites are Love's in Need of Love Today, Village Ghetto Land, Sir Duke, I Wish, Knocks Me Off My Feet, Isn't She Lovely, and As (Always). I can't think of a better double-CD album, (double-LP depending on how old you are) An absolutely timeless classic!
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I'm a fan of the classic version for its kitsch qualities.  As for 2010, it was made for female fans, in my opinion.  You don't have to be concerned with accuracy or consistency of storyline when compared to any other version.  This movie is about hot men being brave and still being totally manly even while wearing skirts.  This is an award-winning collection of hotties for the visual endulgence of the female audience.  I can understand why men are going to rate this one poorly.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|What I liked about the movie were all the little details, their expressions and the cleverness of the script.  The \\"kids\\" sounded like little geniuses and I especially liked the way that, when the characters \\"cursed\\", instead of saying the four letter word, they would say CUSS! (You would have to see how they do it in the movie for this to make sense.)  The teen angst and competition between the young fox cousins is so cute.  The interaction between Mr. Fox and his wife is good too.  Even though I own the dvd, every time it's on cable, I watch it!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|First off, any chance to check out Jason Statham kicking butt, is a chance worth taking.    Second, I wasn't expecting much, I kind of thought it might just be some campy film, but it really is a rock'n good'ol boys, bash and crash, action flic. What else can I say but I was pleasantly surprised.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|I was rather underwhelmed by this movie.  There seemed to be so many \\"plot points\\" that were never resolved and only thrown in because the writers couldn't figure out any other way of getting from point A to point B.  The relationship between Vector and one of the other characters is a case in point.  It didn't really seem necessary other than to have someone calling the shots forcing Vector to compete with Gru.  Which, by the way, is another underdeveloped point.  After the initial animosity, they rarely interact.  Gru's need for the moon was repeatedly explained and it had nothing to do with Vector.    There were several funny parts and my husband quotes lines from the movie from time to time.  Usually I am the move quote champ, but to be honest, he usually has to tell me what part of the movie he's quoting because it was a little forgettable.    I can't comment on the 3D aspect as I saw it on DVD not in the theater.  It wasn't until the short scene during the credits that made us remember it was supposed to be a 3D movie.    Bottom line: enjoyable movie, but glad I borrowed this Single-Disc Edition rather than buying my own copy.  My 5 year-old who LOVES movies didn't want to watch it a second time.
0743496736|5.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult book that I had ever read! I couldnt put it down and I read it in about 2 days!     I would definitely read it again and definitely suggest it to a friend! This is an awesome book!
0596806027|2.0|One of the other reviewers said too much chatter and I totally agree. If you already know html and are looking to get up to speed of some of the new features that html5 has to offer, this is NOT the book for you. This book seems to be more focused on the history of html and everything related opposed the subject at hand. Additionally, the titles of the chapters are meaningless, making this book not very useful as a reference.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Was really impressed with Susan Boyle's voice so decided to buy her CD.  Half of the songs show off her voice to perfection.  The other half don't but this was a matter of selection.  The process through Amazon was excellent.
B004DK49DW|3.0|Good record.. Could have been better. The first track (Road zombie) doesn't fit the album at all.. California (hustle and flow) And (Gimmie the Sweet Low Down) are the best two tracks on the album some of mike ness' best work Musically... Diamond In The Rough &  Machine Gun Blues are forgetable.. though Machine Gun Blues is the first single i hear.. Bakersfield is a smooth track.. Far Side Of Nowhere & Alone And Forsaken are less than standard for the 16 years I've followed the band...Writing On The Wall is depressing.. and Can't Take It With You & Still Alive are forgetable aswell.. Over all though I do Like the Maturation Lyrically and Musically from the last two records... Has a cool southern rock feel to it.. It's good background music for shootin' pool... Over all I'd give it a 3.5 outta 5.. I don't know I guess I'll always be a Some Where Between Heaven & Hell junkie... Where every song is a classic... New fans definitely buy that record and give this one a shot too..

B003H6KRIE|5.0|These movies are all great, and there are a nice amount of extras on each disc. The packaging isn't fancy on this at all, they just slide in and out of the case. If you're looking to get a hold of the trilogy then this is it.
0198326769|5.0|I read this book around two months ago and I LOVED it. The book makes you cry, if you're a sensitive person like me. It is simply a melancholic and beatiful story about holocaust, friendship and childhood ignorance. The story takes place during World War II in a concentration camp in a place named Auschwitz. When I first started reading it, I couldn't get into what was happening. But, I caught the rythm of it through the story. I also saw the movie, but in the book you get a more vivid image of what the main character (Bruno)is passing through. Here's a brief summarry of the story's plot. The story narrates a life from a german kid named Bruno who lives in Berlin with his family. His dad, an officer from the SS gets promoted to Commander and they have to leave their old lives and move to another house. Bruno doesn't feel comfortable in their new home because he misses his old friends in Berlin. In the new house, they had a jew servant named Pavel, which Bruno wasn't allowed to share with because he was jewish. Bruno and his sister, Gretel, get into classes with a tutor that teaches them about nazism. Gretel passes through a big change of personality and starts to admire nazi people. Instead, Bruno still prefers reading adventure books and other stuff. Bruno has been seing from the window of his room in their new house a bunch of people wearing striped pyjamas. One day his curiosity forced him to go there and see who this people were, without his parents permission. When he arrives, he sees behind bars a kid about his age, which seemed scratched and tired. His name was Schmuel. One of the things that caught Bruno's attention was the number he had in his shirt, which indicated his prisoner number. Bruno thought it was of a game he played, but then he realized the truth. This is an act of ignorancy by him but in my opinion that's very common when you're a kid. And for the next days Bruno visited Shmuel to give him food and to have fun. Soon they become best friends whitout his parents knowing anything. One day, Shmuel is unhappy and tells him that he doesn't find his father and asks him to come the next day and get dressed with the pyjama to help him find his father. At first he wasn't sure if he would help him but then he agreed to search his father. And Bruno was there the other day cutting the fence to enter to the concentration camp. In the camp, while searching for Shmuel's father, they get trapped in a crowd of jews that were heading to a place. They couldn't escape from there because the nazis wouldn't permit it. Then they were both trapped in a gas chamber, holding their hands. And soon, they were turned into ash.    Omar Jiménez
0060920084|1.0|This book was the worst of all of Bryson's books that I have read! It is a nonstop complaint of cities and farmland alike. Bryson has absolutely nothing good to say about most of the places he visits. He writes of trying to find the \\"perfect\\" American town, yet he never ventures far enough to really find it. Instead, he rambles on about horrible food (of course the food will be bad if you don't want to spend any money), boring radio stations (cds or mixes would solve this problem), and mean americans (I would not be friendly either if you are going to complain about my neighbors and business). Please. This country has a lot to offer, and Bryson did not showcase much of it.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of both KMM and this series. This book was everything I hoped it would be. I'm excited to read it many more times beacuse I know KMM likes to hide clues in her writing. I can't wait to see what direction this series will go in with her follow up novels. Overall A+!!
1594202842|1.0|What would you say about Amy Chua's family and their definition of \\"success\\" if you had read her previous book \\"World on Fire\\" (2004) on the social dimensions of economic development. In that earlier book, Chua open's her argumentation with the grim story of how her own ruthless and fiercely greedy aunt was killed in a moment of extreme anger by her gardener, or someone else in the service of her family in the Philippines.  (I cannot be specific about who committed the murder nor about the page in the book because I cannot locate my copy of the book right now).    Who knows whether one day Chua's daughter Lulu will pen her own version of \\"Mommy Dearest\\"? But will it be to follow in the footsteps of her mother and make money at the expense of a public of voyeurs? Or will it be to finally break the family curse?    One appropriate comment a reader makes about Amy Chua is: \\"If you cannot be a role model, then be a horrible warning\\".
0439023521|5.0|Typically, I read just about anything. If I absolutely hate it, Ill never finish and it will be prime Goodwill donation fare. If I like it, but have to slog through it I will, but wont ever read it again - although I might try to get through the series. BUT, If its written well enough to capture me, then I will read it more than once, which is what happened with \\"the Hunger Games\\".     I am growing to appreciate the dystopian genre, and this was my first introduction (in book format). I honestly could not put it down and read it over a few days time. Then I absolutely had to have the 2nd. And waited anxiously for the third. As a first in a series, it is tough to avoid reviewing as a part of a whole body of work. But without giving away too much here is what I honestly thought of JUST the Hunger Games.    I loved the character of Katniss. She has a sort of Greek Goddess thing going, like Diana the hunter - pure and ruthless, strong and likable, human, but more. Other characters that stood out to me - of course Haymitch. Whats not to love? A guy who is smart, sassy, desperately trying to help the two tributes from a district that is not known for \\"winners\\". And who did not love Rue - smart, shy, practical, innocent, victim of the ruthless world of adults who have taken her life in a sacrificial entertainment system. And of course I am definitely a huge fan of Peeta. Even though he started out a little \\"whitebread\\", he became the perfect foil to Katniss - he is loving, she is closed off, he is passionate, she is cold, he is (relatively) spoiled, she lived a live full of deprivation. They are total opposites in everything to the degree that like salt and pepper, complement and complete each other...or so we think.    I have to agree that the brutality presented by the author, especially towards the end in that \\"one particular scene\\", that has been mentioned, might be a little too scary for 10-12 year olds, but it made the story much more poignant.    I love the fast-paced adventurous-ness, the cliff-hangers in every chapter. Just when you think that all is lost, and the character will be faced with certain painful death, something comes to the rescue (typically its her skills and smarts), and I loved that roller-coaster ride of adrenalin-pumping \\"what will happen next?\\"    In short, I definitely reccomend \\"The Hunger Games\\".
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie is so great to watch even again and again. Best Blu-ray  Movie to own in your library.
0385341679|5.0|This was probably one of the best books I've ever read. I had a hard time pulling my head out of that world when I wasn't reading and the story has stayed with me long after finishing it. Even now, I'm still thinking about it. All the questions were answered but the author DID manage to leave a few dangling threads. You just *know* there's going to be something else cool on the way. :)<br /><br />Moning's writing is gritty and emotional and she's not afraid to tell the story the way it needs to be told. There are some difficult things Mac has to face to achieve her ultimate goal but when she finally does, you really want to cheer. There were parts that made me choke with emotion and others that made me giggle. I loved her overall story arc, the way she evolved from \\"pretty girl\\" to \\"kick a** girl\\".<br /><br />It's definitely a series on my keeper shelf. And I can't wait to start over with Darkfever and read the whole thing again!
B004HU6YZ4|5.0|OK, it is not their best album, in fact, it probably is their least greatest album. HOWEVER, we are talking about Mike Ness and Social Distortion here and their least best is still greater than 99% of any other band's albums. This album is maybe a little more mainstream and accessible than some of their other stuff, hell, you could call a few songs borderline pop, but overall it is still one solid album. I like the instrumental first track, kind of seemed throwback for Social D. Heck, I like all of the songs, but my favorite would have to be track 3, \\"Gimme the Sweet and Lowdown,\\" excellent rocker. I think this album might bring some new folks into the fold and it might alienate some of the old base. HOWEVER, I am always appreciative whenever I get to hear Mike Ness do anything and this album took too damn long to get here.
030746363X|2.0|Tim has written an interesting piece, with enough amusing anecdotes and easy-to-understand science to be at least somewhat entertaining. Therein lies the problem. I found nothing in this book that I hadn't already uncovered for myself through my own self-guinea pig process and extensive research. He doesn't always give a complete picture. While the science behind his theory may be valid, the real world value may be far from useful. For example, I agree that green tea capsules and ALA are supplements worth considering for reasons other than weight loss, but his PAGG formula made  zero difference in my implementation. He admits that these are things that he tried on himself and encourages the reader to do the same but sometimes seems as if he is promising results based on his experimentation. He occassionally conflicts earlier comments concerning exercise, and I do not agree that you can make the physical change he claims with a minimum dose of exercise; nor am I saying that you have to spend hours at the gym. In my experience, it takes some intense effort, along with some minimum effort to allow for sufficient rest and recovery. If you are the sort of person who, nutrtionally and exercise speaking, are just starting to make a change or are unwilling to put forth the effort to do your own research, the price of this book is not too much to pay. However, I would take his advice as a whole with a grain of salt, except for the part where you need to find what works for you. I wouldn't discourage trying some of his suggestions, but his claims for rapid weight loss, incredible sex and becoming superhuman are dubious, at best. Who knows, if enough people comment on my review, maybe I'll publish a bare bones list of what I currently do to make a buck.

B0035WRY7C|4.0|Fourteen-year-old Alex Rider enjoys a life that many would envy - living in London with his uncle, attending a top-notch private school and spending holidays travelling around the world.  This all comes to an end when his uncle, the globe-trotting banker Ian Rider, dies in a car accident.    As the circumstances of his uncle's crash are made known to him, Alex is convinced that it could not have been the true cause of his uncle's death.  Alex investigates his suspicions, forcing his uncle's true employers - MI 6 - to reveal themselves.  Despite his age and the great danger involved, Alex is forced to finish the mission his uncle died trying to fulfill.    Now he must try to solve the clues his uncle left behind and survive long enough to save England!  Stormbreaker is Anthony Horowitz's first novel for young adults.  Well-received, it spawned a big-screen movie, which Horowitz wrote the screenplay for, as well as the extremely popular series of best-selling Alex Rider adventures.  The themes of self-reliance, self-sacrifice, perseverance and patriotism are woven throughout Stormbreaker.  There is also a heavy emphasis on the uncompromising value of truth.  This book is at a good reading level for 6th-8th graders.  Because Stormbreaker is relies on action and not character development to move its plot forward, I would especially recommend it for boys who are easily bored by reading.

0679731725|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read something unmistakeably great. This book, undoubtedly, is unmistakeably great. To borrow a simile from our dear dignified butler Stevens himself, this book is not dramatically great like the Niagara Falls or the Grand Canyon. Rather, this book is great in an understated sort of way, much like how Stevens perceives that the UK is great because its landscape is understated.    The entire book is written from the butler Stevens' POV. Stevens must be Aspergers-afflicted (for however else shall one describe him?)--he misses so many human cues and yet has such a thoughtful logical way of thinking; it's as if the man trained himself to think of other people; and perhaps he has, perhaps it is something all butlers do... The book has a distinct, uniquely dignified voice, perfectly in character, and while the reader has to read between the lines, nothing is laid out in too obvious a manner, nor is anything so entirely obscure that one finds himself lost and confused.    Truly a masterpiece. It's been a while since I've given any book five stars.
1594202842|2.0|Children thrive in an structured, stable environment where they feel safe.  That said, Chua goes right off the deep end.  What she describes is the behavior of the classic narcissistic parent.  Her daughters only exist to reflect glory on her.  The fact that her daughter threw a screaming fit like that in a restaurant (called her Lord Voldemort! :D)highlights the deep-rooted anger Chua has caused to fester in her.  There is nothing Chinese or Western about it.  This is simple human sickness.  Her daughters will make some therapist very rich.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|SPOILER  In the comic series lori is preggo. I have been reading the series since issue 6 and they are at issue 80. thats 7 years of reading this comic. the cdc scenerio never happened in the comic. personally i hated the cdc end because it took the hope out of the series. In the comic no one knows what happened, why it happened, or if there trully are safe places in the world. By revealing the reason and result of the zombies you take away the mystery and hope factor for these characters. So much of the comic is based on keep going for hope of a better world. Anyways, Lori preggo thing is weird how they played it in the show. I thought the same thing as you when the doc whispered in ricks ear. He took the blood test, he would know. Of course in the comic shane dies very early on. As in while they were still in camp. In the show he is still alive. im guessing that they kept him alive because they want a bigger confrontation about it being shane's baby.   Last spoiler. - I am willing to bet anyone that Merle is going to be the govonor. He wanted to take charge early on in a forcefull way. His racisism will play interesting with the rape scen with michone. Also the obvoius hand being gone will give him perfect reason to cut ricks off later on. Plus they were all in the same area. It would make perfect sence that they would end up close by. For the people that don't believe because the govonor was mexican, dont put too much in that. They changed plenty from the original comic. added new characters, went new places. i dont think they will double think for a second changing his nationality. it never really had much play in the core of the story so they can easily change it.

B00006GEB4|5.0|I have loved this album for years (on CD). I recently started collecting Vinyl albums and when I found this on Amazon I wanted it immediately. I ordered from ImportCDs (through amazon) and got it very quickly and in perfect condition, they actually use proper packaging for vinyl albums.

If you are a fan of \\"The Flaming Lips\\" and of vinyl, then you can't go wrong with this purchase.

B0038W0OHQ|3.0|I preordered these headphones last summer as a treat to myself since prior i was using bad headphones. I really wanted to invest in a decent headset for gaming. After reading about the 7h's and knowing how well the 5h's were since my friend has owned them for a few years now, i decided to splurge 130 on this headset.    I really liked the way they looked, the black matte finish with the light chrome accents looked pretty sweet. I liked the detachable cable, and the fact that the headphone can be broken down into 3 pieces to travel with, although thats hardly a concern for me. And the 2 sets of earcups are another nice little feature.     The sound quality for gaming was quite good, I really appreciated how well they isolated outside noise so you can focus more on whats happening in the game. The bass was there but it seems to be less forward than the mids and the highs, but i believe it was done intentionally so you can hear footsteps and gunfire more clearly. No complaint there. Hooked up with the 7.1 virtual surround sound (if you're buying the usb version) they pinpoint direction noise quite well for a stereo headset.     My biggest issue, and ultimately the deal breaker on this headset is the build quality. At first they apear to be well built, great headphones, much higher build quality than siberias in my oppinion. However, there is a very common issue with the middle headpiece bridge. Basically the middle bridge piece was not built to handle the stress that is being put on the connector pieces, which are made of plastic. Overtime (usually around 1-5months) the middle piece starts the crack and breakdown due to the stress of having it stretch to fit your head while in use. So after a few months of wearing them, they will stop playing sound in one of the earcups, most commonly the right earcup. I wish they had made the connectors a bit more durable, seeing that they have to deal with a lot of stress when worn. You'll notice if you do own them that the headset seems to bend where the connectors are, which is a major problem.    Thankfully Steelseries support was superb when it came to replacing them but alas, the same problem has happened to me again with the replacement and as much as I love their mice and mousepads, I cannot recommend their flagship headset. Maybe I'll get 5h's.     What seems to be a major problem with the 7h's does not exist with the 5h's. They use the same headband bridge piece so it made me wonder why. You'll notice though that 5h's have reinforced the connectors with plastic circlets on the connectors to each earcup, the 7h's do not have these.    Hopefully this review was helpful, i respect steelseries but I do not recommend this particular headset.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Much has been said about these books so I won't go into the story.<br /><br />First let's get the negative out of the way.  The first half of the first book is boring.  It's laden with exposition, the characters are dull, the story has no movement, the main character (Salander) for whom the series is named doesn't appear very often in the first half of the first book (She does provide the only respite from boredom when she does).  Blomkvist (the other main character) is not an interesting guy but takes up most of the first half of the first book.  His development is always somewhat stilted and, although he becomes likeable, he is never very interesting.  You should, however persevere<br /><br />The positive, outweighs the first half of the first book and the defects in the character development of Blomkvist.  Salander is a truly complex and wonderful character.  The contempt for large institutions and governmental bureaucracies comes through loud and clear without hitting you over the head.  The action is excellent. In the end the books are satisfying and thought provoking and I couldn't put the last two down.
B004132I4S|5.0|Inspired by the schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson,the hotly awaited 1st album after 5 years of Sufjan Stevens  repays repeated listening.Greatly inventive orchestration, providing glittery electronic soundscapes with depths of personal feeling and chorale harmonies, strings and wind arrangements,replete with infusions of manic energy.  With superb lyrics. Here it is track by track:-    1)Futile Devices:guitar-picking,piano,double track voice\\"Words are futile devices\\" describes the fallibility of love.Simple opening track.  2)Too Much:Beautiful melodic sound tapestries with musical themes,repetetive song phrases weaving in and out ,with electronic flurries,synthesisers,string connections, distorted trombones,bursts of backing vocals,and climaxing in orchestral breakdown.  3)Age of Adz:Lovely choral sound backing to his poignant voice,string washes and wind instruments elevating the mood,industrial beats emphasising the vocals.  4)I walked:syncopated beat and synthesiser rising and falling.Choir assists Stevens lament the collapse of a love affair over glitchy beats.\\" I'm already dead but I've come to explain why I left such a mess on the floor\\".Also \\" I walked away with a knife in my chest\\".  5)Now that I'm older:sad refrains,subdued tone:\\"Somewhere I lost whatever else I had\\".Gentle washing sounds, choral harmonies .  6)Get Real,Get Right:electronic beat and sound:\\" Have you mistaken me for someone else?\\"Military drums,massed backing vocals,wind instruments,rising chords.\\"Get right with the Lord\\".Apocalyptic.  7) Bad Communication:organ and double-track voice,electronic blips.  8)Vesuvius:piano,doubletrack voice and backing vocals,syncopated slow beat:\\"follow  your heart,follow the joy\\",electronic dripping noises amidst an ending of flutes.  9)All for myself: Stevens voice with backing vocals,piano and flutes,electronic ripples.  10)I want to be well: drums,flutes,electronic beeps, repetition of vocals:\\"Well I want to be\\",\\" I'm not f....ing around\\"overlappping each other,background vocals.  11)Impossible Soul:25 minute piece, huge multi-sectioned arrangement tracking the singer's emotional excavation of a failed romance, which builds to a climactic self-help chant (\\"It's a long ride, better hit yourself, put your face together, better stand up straight - boy, we can do much more together, gotta get it right, get it right, it's not impossible\\") before fading to the first of several fake endings, refusing to die,coming  back again.Beautiful guitar breaks,doubletrack voice,harmonic chorale.

B003UESJH4|4.0|Saw this at the local flicks and it's a shoe-in for the Oscars.Firth has been groomed in film after film for this moment.He's great at playing the uptight Englishman with charm.He's also playing opposite Geoffrey Rush(a previous Oscar winner),who has a capacity to take on diverse roles and run with them,as he does here as Lionel Logue,speech therapist.He seems slightly dumbstruck to find out who 'The Johnsons' are.He brings the slightly pompous Bertie(the future George VI) down to earth.He connects Royalty to the common man as Michael Sheen did as Blair in The Queen.To get so much drama out of someone's speech impediment,and his heroic efforts to overcome it;to give him the best reason too-inhabit his older brother's shoes as King,prior to the 2nd World War,makes him overcome the odds like an athlete who is shy and ill-suited for the role he has to take.But take it he does and performs The Speech to end all speeches.There is enormous patriotic emotion involved and I think I shed a tear or two(or was it a runny nose?).The beauty of the film is in the economy of the script,the opening up of Bertie,the humour of the swearing scenes and the cheek-shaking,to loosen up,as well as the cigarettes.Also the way the camera is never static:it moves continuously up and down and around the talking heads.The period detail is spot on and the supporting cast to die for: Spall as Churchill,Jennnie Ehle as Logue's wife,Jacobi as a rather establishment AoC, Bonnam Carter as Elizabeth, Bertie's charming,steely and quick-witted wife(future Queen mother),Guy Pearce as Edward.This is a brazen awards shot that can't fail,a solidly enjoyable saga of royal infallibility.Tom Hoopper is a director to watch using superb intelligence to tell a story that is rivetting.
0439023521|5.0|After reading sample pages, I had to immediately buy the book.<br /><br />In a futuristic society when the US is under an authoritarian goverment, the Hunger Games provide entertainment to lull the masses. The games are today's reality shows taken to the max. Twenty-four young people are set on each other. The one alive at the end takes home the glory.<br /><br />A boy and girl from each district is chosen by lot. The heroine volunteers when her younger sister's lot is chosen. Their district is one of the poorer ones and its last winner was thirty years before. Katniss knows her gentle sister will never survive. Katniss herself hunts though it is forbidden. At least she has a chance.<br /><br />From that moment, the story takes us through the preparations where the contestants are fed lavish meals and dressed in lavish garb, then sent off into an 'arena' which could be anything from mountains to islands to deserts to grasslands. The temperature can be freezing or roasting. Everything is chosen by the government in charge of the games. Everything is filmed.<br /><br />The object is to keep the population satisfied by watching. Each day's activities - and deaths - are edited and then broadcast. It's a horrifying scenario and the reader is right there with Katniss, wanting to choose the moral thing but forced to choose survival by whatever means.<br /><br />Great read and not just for young adults!

B001974DG0|3.0|I enjoyed this book quiet a bit but I must say it is not my favorite.  As with all of Koontz's novels the characters are first rate but this book moves way to slow to be considered one of Koontz's best stories.<br /><br />It starts out great.  The story is very intriguing.  The main protagonist named Travis meets a dog that he names Einstein. Einstein is much more intellegent than the normal dog. The more Travis gets to know him he realizes that why the dog is so smart is directly related to the danger that is following the dog.<br /><br />Travis meets Nora and that is where the story has trouble with pacing.  I'll be honest I am a Science Fiction/Suspense nut but I don't enjoy emotional love stories. That is why I wasn't a big fan of the middle part of this novel.  I noticed that Koontz did something similar in his book Whispers as the two main characters fell in love the suspense stopped.  However, in this book is took the characters two-thirds of the book to fall in love.  The ending of the book when the suspense returns is great.  I just had a little trouble getting there.<br /><br />The evil that I mentioned is known as the Outsider is written very well and so is the hired assassin that is looking for everyone who is involved in the experiment is also a great and truly evil character.<br /><br />All and all a good book.  If you were a dog lover you will get an extra treat by the reading this book.<br /><br />Grade: B-

B000009HF2|3.0|I guess I was a little too young back in '76 to remember this album, although the popular hits \\"Show Me the Way\\" and \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\" are familiar.  I recently bought a copy because I had heard a lot about it and how important it was, musically, to the rock-pop period of that area.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that I am totally underwhelmed by it, but I also can't say that it's a terribly impressive or epic album.  It's just kinda there.  I do agree that it seems representative of mellower pop-rock of the era.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of 70's music in general, all genres.  I can genuinely say that like the 70s prog rock, reggae, proto-metal & metal, proto-electronica, classic rock, krautrock, punk, disco, new wave, pop, country, soft rock, funk, etc.  Probably my favorite musical decade overall.  And having said that, this album does very little for me.  It's not that it's a bad record, it just seems like a lot of middle-of-the-road filler.  Good background music if you are working on something and don't want to be distracted by the music you are listening to...
B001VNB54A|5.0|It took some time for me to get as emotionally vested in \\"The Pacific\\", as opposed to \\"Band of Brothers\\". Like several have commented, the two series are very different in tone, character arc, story, etc. What I had to realize was that the Pacific War, which this series dramatizes in a very compelling and impactful way, was a very different conflict than the one in Europe.    The war in Europe was one of liberation to free millions of people from Nazi rule. Naturally, this lends itself to noble and heroic dramatizations of the conflict. In the Pacific, however, it was a brutal, no-holds-barred war for survival. Those who fought there weren't liberating anyone. Instead it was kill or be killed.    That's why \\"The Pacific\\" resonates much differently with me. These episodes are emotionally devastating, and serve as harsh reminders of what the war was really about. The main characters descend deeper into darkness as the war grows more brutal and costly. The landscape becomes more hellish, going from lush, forbidding jungle to barren wastelands. Morality gets carved away, layer by layer to the point even when the more idealistic seem to turn into killing machines.    It was very difficult to sit through this series. And this is just a dramatization, with us sa the viewers at a far, far distance from the time, place and visceral experiences of the war. At the end, I felt sad and exhausted, not very eager to see another film or show about the war any time soon.    And because it had this profound effect, I feel that the series is a magnificent piece of television drama, perhaps even a work of art.
B000002LR6|5.0|Damn I love Al's vocals on this album.  I was in college when this thing came out in the summer of '92 and I recall this thing never leaving the CD player for months.  I remember lining up to buy it at midnight on the morning of release.  After the release to JBMH on single a year previously, it seemed like forever waiting for this album.  Guess it took Al & Co awhile to release an album given all the chemical dependency...  'Just One Fix', to this day, remains one of my favorite songs by any band.  Heard the song 1000 times and still not bored of it.  Lots of brilliant industrial-metal abounds on this album:  the aforementioned 'Just One Fix' being the centerpiece, but the anthem 'NWO', the speed-metalesque 'Hero', the dark & plodding 'Scarecrow', and the slide guitar punk of 'JBMH' complete the picture.  The last 2 abrasive tracks, 'Corrosion' and 'Grace' close out the album in the erratic Skinny Puppy industrial manner that 'Abortive' closed out 'The Land of Rape and Honey'.  Hard Core.  (TV II is not worth mentioning - trash.  But given the quality of the rest of the record, Al can be forgiven for letting this useless song make the final cut).  Another thing that I appreciate is that this album flies in the face of the grunge and the commercial metal of Metallica and Megadeth, et al, from the same period.  Many of my favorite bands of that era were toning it down and Ministry came out with this insanity.

B000006TRV|5.0|I'm not going to get into a song-by-song review of this album. That would be tedious and there is nothing that can be written about this album that hasn't already been written. To date, this is the Pinnacle of Progressive Rock.  What strikes me about this album, after so many years, (and after so many listens) is that nothing ever sounded like it before and nothing has sounded like it since. It's pretty much out there by itself. The diversity of sounds, vocals, samples, and sound effects on this album are second to none. The various lyrical concepts on the Wall work on multiple levels. The attention to detail is masterful. I've gone thru periods where I listen to nothing else; just play The Wall over and over.  So do yourself a favor, go out and buy it and listen to it, carefully. No matter how many times you listen to it you'll always enjoy it and you'll always find something new to discover....
B0000029GA|5.0|In my opinion and many other people's opinion that been listening to hip hop since the 80's, this is the best album of all time. So effn nice that Nas himself couldn't top it.  It's like losing your virginity to Halle Berry, what woman that comes behind her is gonna measure up? To this day I listen to this album like it was just released. The beats and prodution are good but it's Nas's lyrics that make this album. You can't be a true hip hop head and not have this in your collection. Buy it!!! You won't regret it. I've already purchased it 3 times since it was released.

143350393X|5.0|It is the best study bible because you buy a study Bible with a package of advantages ...    The Printed version:    The study Bible ever published-with 2.752 pages of extensible, accessible Bible resources. It was created by an outstanding team of 95 evangelical Christian scholars and teachers, as the same way that famous old versions were designed, this is very good because the differences of thoughts give to as deeper study of the various lines of thoughts in the same text. The Bible is full of illustrations, charts, timelines, articles, and introductions. They say reference material-equivalent to a 20-volume Bible resource library all contained in one volume.    The Online version:    The online edition is available free to all who purchase a copy of the print edition. With all the features of the printed version, you can invite 5 people to enjoy this and you can put your own notes. The most impressive! You car listen the Bible online or download it in mp3 to listen any time anywhere.      The translation of the text is the foundational Bible study Creating the notes and other features. Emphasizing word-for-word accuracy, literary excellence, and depth of meaning. As a Brazilian guy I never seen a Bible like this here. I was looking for the one Bible study in English (to go a little further in the study of this language) but to my surprise, I found a \\"collection\\" for study the Bible that accompanies the present without losing the theological basis for less than $ 50.    If you are a non native English speaker like me, this is your study Bible. The only problem is that by having so many pages is not very practical to take to the church (and in my case of course, because most people will not understand this in English ... since now I await the Portuguese version)        Sorry any grammatical or agreement error.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This has to be one of the most spectacular documentaries ever filmed, and I would recommend this to anyone! There are ten total episodes, and they pretty much cover the gamut of \\"life\\" issues. The battle for a mate, the battle for food, and the battle to survive are the three primary aspects of focus, and all three are equally fascinating.<br /><br />The first episode is kind of a generic overview of the premise of \\"Life\\" (and life itself). It's a great intro and, in fact, it was this episode I was able to see on a plane that gave me the desire to see the entire show. That said, because it's a generic overview, there is quite a lot of overlap with later episodes that deal with specific.<br /><br />Episodes 2-6 deal with reptiles/amphibians, mammals, fish, birds, and insects--the bulk of the show's \\"substance.\\" Several episodes have sequences that have never been filmed before, but EVERY episode has something that is jaw-dropping. I really don't want to spoil this for anyone, so let me just say it's completely mind-blowing to see some of the instinctual reactions of these various families of animals. Again and again and again I was amazed and astounded. (Really, I know I'm using a lot of hyperbole, but if you watch it you'll know what I'm talking about!)<br /><br />Hunters and Hunted is episode 7--a variation on the theme of having episodes on different orders of animals. Nothing specific to call out on this episode, but if you're a big fan of seeing bigger animals *try* to eat smaller animals, this episode is for you!<br /><br />The last three episodes go back to the former structure and cover creatures of the deep, plants, and primates. I've seen good documentaries on deep sea creatures before, so this was a little lackluster to me, but it still had fascinating stuff. The plant episode actually surprised me. They had to cheat quite a bit to get the filming of this episode, but I couldn't believe how interesting plant life really is--and how plants, without brains, have similar instinctual reactions to animals. The primate episode was like the grand finale, making the inevitable comparisons to humans, etc. (Personal view here--I don't believe humans are animals.) I will say this, the acts of kindness done by certain of the primates was quite touching!<br /><br />Overall, this is really a priceless show, and I'm so impressed. I'm also anxious to see if some of the other BBC documentaries are as good as this. Feel free to let me know if you've seen them!ns to animals.

1935251740|1.0|I had high hopes for this book.  It failed to lived up to those aspirations. There is nothing new factually or conceptually in this work.  It restates very old arguments about quantum mechanics without offering any new insight into his concept of \\"biocentrism\\".  Yes we fail to understand our reality but this adds nothing new.  The idea that it is all in our mind is not a new idea.  The book is full of self platitudes and personal memories that greatly detract from the message.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Hello:    I bought and received the 50th Anniversary Edition BluRay for the Hitchcock classic North by Northwest. The movie is great and the BluRay clarity makes you feel as if 1958-59 was yesterday and you are there. Picture quality and soundtrack are excellent and the BluRay comes with a background booklet filled with tidbits of how the movie was made. Additionally, the add-ons cover the careers of Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant as well as interviews with Eva Marie Saint. This was a bargain and point of note - I received two days after ordering (right around the Christmas holiday when things are usually slow).    I highly recommend this to everyone - even my 21 year old daughter loved it seeing it for the first time.

B0015DROBO|3.0|I saw the movie first. My best description of the movie is that it is intense. It is a very dark and suprisingly violent thriller. I watched it streaming on Netflix and had to pause it for several minutes just to give my mind a break. It was a great movie. In fact, I picked up the book because the movie was so good. It took me months to get through the book, initially forcing myself to get through the beginning chapters. As you would expect there are many more details in the book and of course scenarios were slightly changed for the movie. In comparison, the book just seems ok; it is the movie that stays with me. However I was intrigued enough with the book to read the remaining two in the trilogy prior to seeing their corresponding movies. Both the The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest were hard to put down. I was grateful that I had read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for the background that it provided. So there may be some issues with the wording, probably due to translation, but unless you are  a real stickler for grammar in your fiction it shouldn't bother you; the story is exciting enough to entertain you. I am looking forward to seeing the remaining two movies.
0446691437|5.0|Many artists and would-be artists will be put off by this title (The War of Art).  But for anyone in a creative field, this is a very powerful and useful book.  This book is ultimately about the difference in making art when it's convenient or when you feel like it (which means you'll rarely create your art and you certainly won't get very good) versus committing to your art, being an artist when it isn't fun or your stomach hurts or it's a really nice day and you'd rather cloud watch or sleep-in or have that extra cup of coffee or call your friend and chat.  This book is the ultimate compliment to the artists out there, because it's basically saying that you produce great art not because you're talented (because there are plenty of talented people who look or listen to something and then say \\"I could have done that\\" but of course they never do because they don't pay the price).  Instead you produce great art because it isn't easy, it requires skill, it requires dedication and those that are committed to their art will succeed (and those who wait for when it's convenient mostly won't).    It's a quick read, a great reference to go back to and I've referred this book to a wide range of other artists (musicians, photographers, writers, potters, painters).  You may not find anything in here to be profound or beautiful.  But you will absolutely find a lot that gets you off of your chair and into your studio.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed the Girl Who Played with Fire immensely. While I had found it harder to get through The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (possibly because I saw the movie first), this book was hard to put down and within minutes of finishing it on my Kindle I ordered and began reading the final book in the trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I'm amazed at the number of reviews that find these books to be drivel. Unless you can only enjoy realistic fiction were the feats performed by the characters must be something that the ordinariy person can do, just like fans of the Bourne series you can suspend belief in parts of the story and still enjoy it. I have since watched the corresponding movie to the trilogy and find that the book was so much better, but then that's usually the case isn't it?

I acknowledge Mr. McDonald's truly impressive background and inclination to narrative style, however, distancing from the author's credentials the book lacks any spice such as enlightening conclusions, forward-looking statements, etc. For this purpose I treat it as a \\"timeless memoirs\\" of a relatively young man with lotsa peculiar Lehman insider stories without which the book would have been rather plain and, judging by degree of verbal anger emanating in the pages dedicated to description of its last CEO Dick Fuld and \\"that daughter of Russian-born owner of a Los Angeles grocery store Roberta Achtenberg\\", reminding a public complaint in view of an open letter.

B004FLKV5O|5.0|I've had this box for several years now, and I am reviewing it on the occasion of my first live Wagner opera -- I saw the Met HD Live broadcast of DAS RHEINGOLD recently, with Bryan Terfel as Wotan, an incredible production and performance, with the indefatigable James Levine!<br /><br />I gradually worked my way up to a complete recording of The Ring, starting with [[ASIN:B0000041EJ a 2-disc set of highlights from Bohm live at Bayreuth in 1967]], and then listening to the four 1-disc highlights of [[ASIN:B0009WHABQ Das Rheingold]], [[ASIN:B00005RC81 Die Walk&uuml;re]], [[ASIN:B0009WHAC0 Siegfried]], and [[ASIN:B00068C888 Gotterdammerung]] from this cycle, Barenboim recorded at Bayreuth in 1991/92.<br /><br />After familiarizing myself with Wagner's soundworld, reading about Wagner, particularly Bryan Magee's excellent [[ASIN:080507189X The Tristan Chord: Wagner and Philosophy]], and investigating the various options for a complete Ring Cycle, I decided on this Barenboim box.<br /><br />While I tend to listen to the four highlights discs from this set rather than the entire operas, it is great to have for occasional listening.  Unfortunately the reissue does not contain the entire libretto, as did the original box, which is a major drawback.<br /><br />Still, I recommend it without reservation to anyone interested in hearing Wagner's Ring!<br /><br />(verified gift)
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Written and Directed by Richard Kelly (ASIN: B00005V3Z4)<br /><br />Any reviewer would be hard-pressed to discuss this film without giving away significant details. Donnie Darko is a snake eating its own tail, a story where the circularity of the plot is an integral part of its enjoyment, and so many seemingly insignificant moments through the film prove crucial to the end result, a kind of dark surprise different from any of the tired twists found in recent big-budget films.<br />It is 1988. A borderline schizophrenic teenage boy, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is haunted by visions of a man-sized rabbit named Frank. In addition to the prophetic announcement that the world will end in \\"28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds,\\" Frank forces Donnie to commit a series of increasingly serious misdeeds.<br /><br />As if this is not enough, a crash course in Einstein-Rosen bridges aka wormholes by physics teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff (Noah Wyle,) along with a copy of The Philosophy of Time Travel, convinces Donnie that a \\"fourth dimensional construct\\" has touched down right in his home town, allowing him to see such apparently hallucinatory events as streams of computer-generated liquid that hint at people's intentions.<br />Set to an eclectic 1980s soundtrack, and also starring Drew Barrymore (producer for this project,) Mary McDonnell and yes, Patrick Swayze, Donnie Darko is deliberately vague as to its genre--the film moves effortlessly from horror to science fiction to psychological drama, and does so successfully. The setting is vintage to the time period, but not prone to the heavy-handed display of era-specific props as other near-period pieces.<br />The DVD (from CBS/Fox Home Video) contains the 113 minute feature film in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1,) deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, director's commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal, the The Philosophy of Time Travel, music video for covered 80s song \\"Mad World\\" and an art gallery with production skills.<br />This review is for the Region 1 encoded DVD with English and Spanish subtitles and English and French Dolby surround.encoded DVD with English and Spanish subtitles and English and French Dolby surround.

B00006AUIG|5.0|Written by Brad Anderson & Stephen Gevedon; Directed by Brad Anderson (ASIN: B00005UQ9F)<br /><br />The best rule for a horror story is \\"Don't show the monster.\\" Alfred Hitchcock knew it. Robert Wise (The Haunting, 1963) knew it. Director Brad Anderson has mastered it. Much like the original version of The Haunting, Session 9 also takes advantage of another great rule in horror: \\"Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere.\\" The camera drifts around corners and into the harsh shadows of Danvers State Mental Hospital, a real hospital and portrayed in its genuinely rundown condition.<br /><br />Gordon Fleming, played eerily spot-on by Scottish actor Peter Mullan, leads the team of Hazmat Elimination Co. into the vacant corpse of a once prominent mental institution famous for its invention of the pre-frontal lobotomy. Their job is filthy, dangerous and stressful--to strip all the carcinogenic asbestos insulation from the building before its imminent refurbishing one week later. David Caruso, Stephen Gevedon, Josh Lucas, and Brendan Sexton III round out the cast as the rest of the elimination team, each hinting at the shortcomings that have landed them in this hellish job. The promise of a $10,000 bonus hanging just beyond reach, they set out to clean the facility.<br />But Danvers State also holds its own attractions. For Mike (Stephen Gevedon,) it is the taped sessions with a psychotic patient named Mary Hobbes. For Hank (Josh Lucas,) it is the stash of old coins and trinkets he discovers hidden in the walls. For Phil (David Caruso,) it is perhaps the ultimate ownership of Hazmat Elimination Co. And for Gordon, it is something far more unsettling and not altogether natural.<br />Perhaps the most imposing character in the film is Danvers State Mental Hospital itself. Shaped like a bat, with a once administrative area branching off into \\"wings,\\" the farthest reaches of this enormous creature were reserved for the most severely psychotic cases...cases like Mary Hobbes.<br />An effective use of foreshadowing, steady rise in tension, masterful cinematography and a group of solid character-actors makes Session 9 the best film to grace an otherwise flagging genre since, well, The Haunting.<br />The DVD (from USA Home Entertainment) contains the 100-minute feature film in letterbox, Deleted Scenes (including a wisely rethought alternate ending,) Story-to-Screen storyboard comparisons, Director's Commentary (with blessed on/off feature,) a chilling theatrical trailer, and the fascinating featurette, \\"The Haunted Palace,\\" a look at the very real location and some of the art inspired by it.<br />This review is for the Region 1 encoded DVD with English Closed Captioning and Dolby Digital Stereo.ing, steady rise in tension, masterful cinematography and a group of solid character-actors makes Session 9 the best film to grace an otherwise flagging genre since, well, The Haunting.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|Salt is a lightweight action thriller with lots of highly exaggerated action that is not believable.  But if you can ignore that problem it is entertaining.
160459201X|2.0|The idea promoted in this book is sound and deserves proper consideration. But after understanding it in the first few pages, I was simply skipping from page to page trying to find something that the author hadn't said yet - there was nothing. All but the first two pages of this book are full of repetitions of the one idea outlined in the beginning, and fake-sounding anecdotes trying to \\"prove\\" that the author is right.    I didn't check whether Amazon offers a preview of the first few pages, but if it does - I suggest you read them and avoid buying the book itself.
0596805888|5.0|This book came as scheduled, even during the busy holiday season. My Dad (who is a professional scientist) loved it. It was also in great condition when I received it! I highly suggest getting this book from Amazon- I saved at least $10 by not buying it from the local bookstore!
B001ISN0F0|5.0|A very unique novel that digs deep into the soil of reality, it focuses on forbidden love that every intelligent person knows happens often in real life.  The story builds on the star-crossed lives of a humble family trying hard to make a living in the Australian outback, and Father Ralph, the exquisitely handsome and worldly Catholic priest to whom the family has entrusted their faith and prayers. The young daughter, Meagan, is enthralled by the priest to whom her love and admiration never dulls as she, and Father Ralph, grow older in the hard scrabble outback. The book paints a breathtakingly beautiful portrait of hard living in a hard, untamed but wonderful land. Through the years, Meagan and Ralph must always remain separate, she becomes a beautiful and successful rancher, he a rising star in the hierarchy of the Catholic church, all the while trying to hide their mutual attraction for each other.  Ralph struggles with his priestly vows to the church, Meagan fights her demons of lust in her desires to hold Ralph between her hungry thighs, knowing that if she ever could seduce him, he would make his vows to her, not to the greedy church who steals this magnificent specimen of manhood from her.    The Thorn Birds is hard to put down. The gripping and heart rending end will keep readers spellbound and a little mystified, but never unsatisfied.  One of the best novels of our time, The Thorn Birds is destined to remain a classic.  This my third reading since the 1970's, and still it moves me only as other great classics, such as Gone With the Wind,or the epic story of Evangeline, can. It's a tale of romance that is gripping and gritty, but also soft and sweet.  A must read for any one who has ever had an ounce of romantic fantasy in their heart.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Great show.    DVD are just that, DVDs.    Lots of special features that are neat but the episodes are the show-stopper.
0385341679|3.0|I am of the camp that this series was stretched over too many books. I think this would have been a perfect trilogy. So this book, with the cramming of info and the incesant internal ponderings wore thin for me. Then the end, which I had expected to be a big showdown, kind of fizzled. I felt like most of the twists she just threw out there, didn't conclude and just rushed to finish. I think Moning is a great author, but this book didn't deliver for me as far as being the finale in an 'epic' series. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the relationship she brought together.
0345479092|5.0|I read countless books when pregnant with my first baby and The Baby Whisperer was by far my favorite. I found Tracy's methods to work beautifully on my son and would suggest this book to anyone. I believe you have to take these books, and any advice on parenting for that matter as options. Some of the people who reviewed this book negatively have clearly missed that point. I appreciated her section on breastfeeding and was happy to see a book that did not scold or guilt mother's into breastfeeding. Once again when the topic of breastfeeding comes up people are so quick to shame other's into making the same choices as they did.     This book will help you understand and communicate with your baby and is a wonderful tool to develop strong sleeping habits. Enjoy!
B002ZG99N6|3.0|After his success directing the gritty and absorbing 2007 GONE BABY GONE, Ben Affleck's next directorial feature was this over-the-top heist fantasy that's supposed to be in a similar milieu (working class Boston) but which is more of a fantasy thriller. Affleck plays Doug Macray, a handsome working stiff from deepest darkest Charlestown, the notorious crime-ridden neighborhood of Boston around the Bunker Hill Monument; with a father (Chris Cooper) serving multiple life terms in prison and a friend-who-is-all-but-a-brother (Jeremy Renner) pressuring him, he has no choice but to take to the mean streets and rob armored cars and banks in the streets of Boston and Cambridge. But if the cheap pubs and overripe Boston accents suggest realism, the film veers wildly from realism in its portraying of the superheists that Doug plans with the supergenius criminal planning of a Thomas Crown or a Lex Luthor. Constantly changing elaborate disguises and foreseeing every eventuality to the smallest detail, Doug's gang has the FBI (led by Jon Hamm) completely buffaloed, which Doug (a decent sort deep down, of course) falls madly in love, surreptitiously, with a tasteful, accentless bank manager (Rebecca Hall) he in disguise previously took hostage in a heist, and who represents A Better Life for Affleck's character. But (of course), just when he thought he was out, they keep pullin' him back in...     There aren't many heist and gangster movie cliches this film ever avoids, but, mysteriously, critics have taken it very seriously, probably because of the adrenaline charge that Doug's fancy heists admittedly provide. Jeremy Renner is effective in his turn as a mean little thug who starts out like Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS but by the end is more like the crazed Jimmy Cagney at the end of WHITE HEAT; Affleck himself is quite good in his ridiculous role; and poor Jon Hamm has to wrestle with phrases the screenwriters seem to have trotted out to allow him to flaunt a faux-Boston accent (one of his choicer lines entails both the phrases \\"Star Market\\" and \\"a roll of quarters\\"). At the very least you never get bored with the film; but though it's not bad, it's also pretty silly.
B003L20IFQ|3.0|Ist off, if you truly suffer from claustraphobia tread lightly. I am not sure if I truly am a claustrophobe.I do know that tight confines freak me out! I had a physical reaction within the first 30 min of this movie and felt ill... panting.. couldn't sit still... literally sick to my stomach. (Spoiler)... when Ryan Reynolds loses it momentarily I felt like I was crawling out of my skin with nowhere to go.. I had to keeping looking away from the screen. So from that aspect this movie grabbed me and pretty much didn't let go until the sucky ending.... I appreciate the twist but must say it was just an overall downer... (the ending)      The plot was vague.... why did they kidnap a truck driver... for the $..?? Didn't know truck drivers made that much... was America going to go out of their way for this one civillian? Why did he have to make a video?  The endless phone calls resulting in extdended holds or just getting answering machines was over the top... I mean after like the 30 calls he makes can't he get a hold of anyone?   Popcorn movie? Not even close... if I may... pretty much a waste of your time... the payout just isn't there.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Sidney Lumet's film \\"Serpico\\" is a brilliant depiction of Peter Maas' book on this simple, angry, and compassionate man who would end up turning the NYPD on it's head with the Knaap Hearings and firsthand eyewitness accounts of police corruption.<br /><br />Frank Serpico, now 73, is played by a young Al Pacino straight off the first installment of the \\"Godfather\\" trilogy.  An idealistic young man who expects nothing more than to do what a police officer is actually supposed to do--protect the innocent and fight crime wherever it is found--finds himself in the NYPD of the early to late 1960's.  This a time in which the Italian American mafia had grown in power very significantly, before the Joseph Pistones and Henry Hills and Sammy Gravanos of the world appeared.  Lumet's skill in filming pre-Giuliani NYC almost reaches the level of Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />From the first frame of the film one can see what is coming.  Serpico's alienation from his lazy, alarmingly serene fellow police officers is at first harmless, but when he realizes the reasons for their serenity (a cop gives him an envelope filled with 300 dollars for no apparent reason) the nightmare begins.  Naturally he believes that taking it to an authority figure in the department will start some kind of investigation.  He is told (and this is taken directly from the book) that if he decides to make any trouble over it he will be discovered \\"facedown in the East River\\" once all the investigations are over.  The Commissioner seems almost annoyed that he has to be bothered with any of this.  Doesn't Serpico know that the guys take money from mobsters and shake down drug dealers?  What planet is he from?<br /><br />This story is almost biblical in nature and Lumet certainly took pains to make the other cops (with the exception of one or two other honest cops who tried to help him) around Serpico look agents from some Satanic agency a la Miss Baylock in the Omen.  Obese, cruel looking, base and violent, his position of honesty and refusal to participate even one inch in any division's dishonesty makes you fear for the guy.<br /><br />In the tradition of the saints, he remains joyful and full of life despite his untenable situation.  Girlfriend after girlfriend come and go, at first enjoying his joie de la vivre and then being overwhelmed by his moods of agitation and fury at the corruption surrounding him.  Pacino does all this with his trademark intensity: perhaps the best scene in the film, also taken from the book, is when he humiliates a mobster who he arrests on the street for running numbers and who is a good buddy of all the men he works with.<br /><br />Running from official to official, he is screwed around with to the point where one can visibly see him losing faith in the system.  His best friend, a more formal but equally just cop (Bob Blair played by Tony Roberts in an understated, realistic performance) uses all the connections he has to get Serpico a hearing on police corruption.<br /><br />It happens, but not before Serpico is set up by a group of his fellow officers and shot in the face.<br /><br />This is a tale for the ages and one which should not be forgotten.  The might of one strong, good man truly cannot be nailed down by a thousand weak corrupt ones.  Recommended to all, along with the book of the same title by Peter Maas.position of honesty and refusal to participate even one inch in any division's dishonesty makes you fear for the guy.<br /><br />In the tradition of the saints, he remains joyful and full of life despite his untenable situation.

030746363X|5.0|I'm loving Tim Ferris's new book! It's fun to read, engaging, exciting and a little risque... of the 3 billion fitness books out there, this is one of four I've had to buy (the others are \\"Slow Burn\\" by Hahn and Eades, \\"Power of 10\\" by Zickerman, and \\"Body by Science\\" which is in the other room so the author's name eludes me.  Anyhoo, this one is worth adding to the collection, folks!  I know there are critics out there, but there are critics of every system I've seen...  and heck, it all works for me!  I'm losing those last five pounds, that's right, the elusive last five!  I must say months of running and elliptical machines etc. didn't do much...  I was into it, but to no avail!  Using Tim's diet guidelines (especially the cheat day, wooohooo!) and the workout method contained in this and the other books I mentioned, I'm seeing it happen!  Yay!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I purchased this CD based on the song Born Free.  I heard it on the half time show of an NFL game and fell in love with it.  My boyfriend told me to get it for Christmas and I've played it over and over ever since.  It is a different Kid Rock but you can tell it's still the KID.  He puts alot of his soul into the songs and portrays another side of himself.  If you liked the title song \\"Born Free\\" you'll like the rest of the CD and I'd recommend to buy it.  However, if you are expecting the hard rocking and rapping Kid Rock you won't find it here so don't buy it.  I love the CD and have become over the years a big KID ROCK fan.  Another good thing about this CD \\"no bad language like the f and mf words\\"!!!  That is the only thing I don't like about his songs so I always get the clean version.  Other than that I love KID ROCK and all his music.
B00402FGE4|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and I wish they had the Season 2 episodes on DVD as well.     I am not one to nit pick and ruin an entertaining storyline, I either like something or I don't and I loved SGU. Initially I did not want to give it a chance but the dynamics of the struggle for control between civilian, military and scientific leadership pulled me in and the character development held me.     I have to say I am left wondering what happened to the first two people who took off on their own in the initial planetside episode, through the planets stargate.    I also am left hanging because the last three episodes of the first season follow a thread that is of course not finished until season 2.     I say buy Season one and then get bootleg of season two, perhaps they will be inspired to not drag their butts in making a DVD for season 2 and then we can pick it up in legit packaging then. By the time they get around to it you will have forgotten season one and have to watch it again anyway.
B00142X56Y|1.0|I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8\\" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6\\" apart. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.<br />I use the surround tracks and prefer DTS if a choice is available.<br />Unfortunately not every recording gives me that feeling of being there.<br />In the case of the magic flute (LPCM 5.1), the orchestra is recorded ok, but the sound field does not really go much beyond the corner speakers. The surround speakers are not much used for the orchestra.<br />While the voices are recorded pretty clear, they are coming mostly from  the left speaker. The applause on the other hand, is mostly sent to the right speakers. This gives the impression as if you sit at the left side balcony of the theater where you would have the music to your left and the audience/applause to the right. But you sit in the middle as far as the orchestra is concerned. Makes no sense to me and detracts from the performance. Then it dawned on me: The voices are sent to the wrong speakers! Everything is one off to the left. What ought to go to the center goes to the left front speaker. What should go to the left front goes to the left surround etc. The applause, that was mend to be the 2 surrounds ends up at the right front and right surround. How can Opus Arte release this one?<br />Then I switched to stereo and the sound is how you would expect it, everything from the front and the voices in the middle.<br />Another example of how poor the audio part of blu rays can be.<br />It would probably get five stars if the speaker assignment was correct, so only one star.<br /><br />EDIT1: Opus Arte confirmed the fault in an e-mail to me on 2/25/2011 End of edit<br /><br />EDIT2 of 7/9/2011: Received the corrected version of the Magic Flute from Opus Arte on 7/8/2011. Applause is now from the surrounds and voices from the center. The Id-# on the inner ring is A0101759536-A911.<br />If your LPCM Multi track has the applause from the right front and right surround, you have the defective disc (#A0100907890-B911)

B000002G8L|5.0|What makes this album so great is the pure improv feel to the leads , it is blues at it should be played.<br />No polished studio sound , just a raw and gritty rendition of some of his better cuts.  It is one of the very few CD's I own that I can listen to at almost anytime and not get sick of it , I enjoy the immersion into his bluesy world every time. I am a blues guitarist , but this can be enjoyed by anyone who has a slant toward this style of blues-rock , it is a CLASSIC.

B004E547D8|1.0|The movie is a quality no-brain popcorn flick.  However the blu-ray release comes in two flavors, barebones and special edition.  This barebones (movie-only) edition has lossy quality audio most commonly found on DVDs.  With the conception of blu-ray two lossless audio codecs were introduced DTS-HD MA and Dolby TrueHD, the special edition utilizes the DTS-HD MA codec.  The lossy audio makes this product a 1 star, blu-ray is HD and putting a product out that isn't both HD audio and HD video is an attempt at fooling the customer; shame on Summit.  The special edition would get a 4/5 star from me as it has HD audio, DTS-HD MA (just an FYI for those reading this review when it shows up on the special edition blu-ray page).<br /><br />Recently I read a great metaphor for lossy versus lossless compression algorithms.  Basically lossy is how you can take a photograph in its RAW format and compress it into another form such as JPG.  The file becomes smaller because bits are thrown away, the image still looks good enough when viewed in certain ways but those bits cannot ever be retrieved. Lossless compression is like when you ZIP a file on your computer, when you unzip the file all the bits are still there.  So basically lossless audio codecs allow all the audio information to be present for your system to utilize them, making them sound more definitive and crisp because all the bits are there!

144471032X|5.0|I have just finished reading Dr. Dukan's book and must say I feel if nothing else very informed. He really explores the reasons behind the success and failure of peoples tendency to diet, lose the weight and then through time put it all back on again. He aims to give tools to help the reader from day one until you have \\"graduated from being overweight\\".     It is too soon to tell if this program will be a success for my husband and I. However, the information about the human body, how you process the things you put in your body/mouth, and tools for staying on track on any diet will stick with me for a lifetime.    I predict that once this book is released here in the US, it will be the next big thing ;)

0007308809|5.0|This refrain appears throughout Adichie's dynamic political fiction and is an accurate description of the world's response to the holocaust that engulfed the fledging, short-lived nation of Biafra. In 1967 when the Igbo people seceded from Nigeria, few Americans could have found Nigeria on the map, let alone its rebellious eastern region. Thus, the civil war earned space in the U.S. on the evening news only after Western journalists started wiring photos of the starving babies, who were among the casualties of the government's siege tactics.  Sad as these scenes were, preoccupation with our own war in Vietnam hurried Biafra and its children from our TV screens and our consciousness. Adichie reawakens this consciousness with a forceful story of great loves and terrible losses shown through the lives of unforgettable characters.     The novel doesn't open with the war, but with the love matches that sustain the lead figures through the war when it comes. Arguably, the biggest love is between Olanna and Kainene, estranged twins. Their seemingly lop-sided relationship is the perfect metaphor for a newly independent nation that is bent on remaining unified regardless of the cost. Nigeria broke into civil war following military coups and ethnic discord. (The full history is worth learning if only to see the parallels with the current situation in Sudan.) The link between Olanna and Kainene, with differences rooted in childhood, fractures in the same way. So different in appearance and temperament, the sisters, like the fighting Nigerian clans, are bound by borders drawn by others and not of their own choosing. In addition to the sisters, the writer brilliantly crafts other equally complicated people. She connects all of them - the parents, the lovers, the fellow refugees - with tangled threads of opposing opinions and complex loyalties grounded in sharply distinct social classes. There are the well-educated, well-traveled and well-heeled professionals, who enjoy refrigerators, pianos, books and aged whiskey. Then there are the rest of the populace: servants in the city, peasants in the rural villages. The war changes everything.  Professor and peasant alike are reduced to hunger and deprivation. At just the right times, Adichie inserts  references to the U.S. - a Beatles song, Frederick Douglas' autobiography, the church bombing in Birmingham - just enough to show us that the Igbos were aware of what was happening in the world. Even if the world didn't know what was happening to them. Even if the world was silent when they died.
0439023513|2.0|I LOVED Hunger Games, and was still hanging on for Catching Fire, but I actually almost gave this book 1 star! It was so bad! The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is that the series ended. Often, authors intend to write a trilogy and it turns into a sprawling mess, so I have to applaud Ms. Collins' ability to actually end the series. But, it was too tragic!    I don't like to have spoilers, so I won't comment on what was tragic, but overall, I felt like I had been bludgeoned to death by one tragic event after another. In addition, I figured that Katniss would eventually flesh out as a likable, or at least believable, character. I was wrong. The resolution of the Peeta/Gale thing was pretty weak as well.    I am usually obsessed with having every book in series that I've read, but I actually sold Mockingjay to a second-hand book store. I would recommend reading the first two books and then just creating your own adventure for the end. Don't put yourself through this book.

0920668372|5.0|Beautiful book for ANY Mom! I have given this book many times as a gift for both baby showers and Mother's Day.  I first saw this book in 1996 when it was given to my brother, from my mother, as part of his college graduation gift.  Funny at the time but it resurfaced a number of times between the two of them for the following few years.  Sadly, she was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer and passed in 2004. Two copies of this book, each containing a letter from my mom were left for my brother.  One to be given after she passed and another copy to be given the following year on his 30th birthday. Every time I see this book it makes me both smile and cry. Any book that brings joy to both adults and children deserves to be read and added to your family book collection. 5 stars & buying it again today for a freind who is expecting her first son!
B003VANOFY|5.0|If I were after sound quality I normally wouldn't even glance in the direction of Logitec brand products. It seems the options for a wireless headset of any quality are kind of difficult to come by. Givin how easy Amazon is to deal with concerning returns, I figured I would give these a try. My expectation really werent all that high but I was willing to sacrifice some quality for a wireless headset and my research led me to beleive these were worth a try because if nothing else, the wireless headset didnt have too many issues.    Much to my surprise I love almost everything about them. Being used to brands such as Sennheiser, i was astounded by the sound quality these produce. Set the EQ where you like it and the sound quality really is enjoyable. Maybe not audiophile level, but everything was acceptable to me. Setup was super easy. In a couple minutes everything was set up and working on my 64bit WIn 7 machine. All my fellow gamers and people I call on the phone mentioned how much my sound was improved with the new mic.     The construction feels pretty solid and not cheap at all. The design is good and unlike my last mic, the ear cups fit over my large head and completely cover the ear.     Being surprised by the basics, i was astounded again with the other cool features. The surround sound works perfectly and sounds great with the few application and movies I tested it with. The three programmable buttons on the side of the headphone is surprisingly useful. I set them up to control itunes and being able to shuffle, browse, start/stop my music without so much as minimizing the program im working with is awesome!     At the $150 price point, I think these are a steal. Also its not uncommon for there to be a rebate at any given time. Highly recommended for multimedia users.
B004HW7JMO|3.0|SPARTACUS: GODS OF THE ARENA  hit the screen as a waystation until the recovery of the ailing Andy Whitfield. It would have been far better had the producers awaited Whitfield's return or simply to change the format of this popular series in the event that Whitfield indeed may not be able to return at all. What we have now in the 'temporary arena' is a script that is so pottymouth oriented that even the most tolerant of audiences must find it oppressive. The manner in which the original show used physical encounters frequently at least had a modicum of taste, but in the new series the result is like a late night cheap porno movie. There is less character development in the newly introduced ludus owners and the new 'star gladiator' Gannicus (Dustin Clare) appears to devote more time to drinking and bedding than fighting. Ashur (Nick Tarabay) is back, not crippled yet, John Hannah returns as Batiatus with his promiscuous Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), Crixus (Manu Bennett) is also back as is Peter Mensah as the honorable teacher Oenomaus. Now that the DVD of the season is available the whole series can be viewed and admittedly the total season improved on the initial few episodes. The script is stilted 'contemporary Latin' (\\"apologies\\") requiring subtitles to understand, and the blood flies around to an even greater extreme than in the original series. But the main problem with this new version is the lack of any characters for whom we care. While Whitfield is sorely missed, Dustin Clare as the new hero gladiator ended up a credible persona. Grady Harp, March 11
B001B51B9M|5.0|This is a classic musical made even more so by the performance of Robert Preston. The dated content is part of the charm. The lost art of the traveling salesman is brought back with whimsy and laughs together with fine songs. Of course it wouldn't work unless this traveling salesman ran into trouble in the town coupled with a sudden love interest in the local 'spinster'. Excellent support from a fine cast of character actors.
0316017922|4.0|I understand Mr. Gladwell's thesis to be that outliers are not really outliers at all; that extraordinarily high achievement -- be they hockey players, Bill Gates or the Beatles -- comes from a combination of luck and circumstance, which is largely out of an individual's control, and sustained and prolonged application of one's abilities (often called hard work) to make the most out of the opportunities that luck and circumstance have allowed.  The suggestions for equalizing opportunity are interesting, as they call not for reducing someone else's opportunity but simply for some adjustments that are common sense and fair.  Two examples: hockey players in Canada have a decided advantage the earlier in the year they are born, simply because a 9 year old born in January is usually far more developed physically and otherwise than a 9 year old born in November.  It seems a good argument that perhaps twice as many good hockey players would be developed if the hockey player age groups were split into 6 month increments rather than a year.  Another example is the education achievement gap for poor and middle class or upper middle class children.  They start out pretty close in testing and learn at very close and similar rates during the school year.  However, the poor children regress significantly between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year.  As the school years pass, the gap widens.  A change in the school calendar would be a sensible reform.  Finally, the discussion that math aptitude correlates strongly with willingness and inclination to sit and work the problems is one that too many parents will no doubt recognize.

B0000013GT|5.0|Man oh Man what can I say about the legendary Outkast that people haven't said already? Just when you thought they couldn't get any iller than their debut(southernplayalisticaddilacmusik) they not only come correct with ATLiens, but it also exceeds the debut! There are no flaws on this record just andre & big boi at their peak & big boi stepped his rhymes up from their debut & andre sounds as smooth as ever! This album has that night time/outer space feeling to it in other words this album takes your mind on a spiritual journey! This whole album is incredible but the stand outs are: Me & You(Elevators), 13th Floor Growing Old, Mainstream(A song that def applies to today's so called \\"hip hop\\") Babylon, ET, & the title Track, ATLiens! This is real southern hip hop not some pop dance garbage like soulja boy or wikity wack rhymes like wacka floka flame, just 2 ill mcs with ill beats from you know who, organized noize! Get this album NOW if you don't have it already & let andre & big boi take your mind to outer space heights with this gem!

B0014JLYS8|4.0|I have been happy with the bistro clog.  I work as a server in a fairly busy restaurant.  I have had a pair of the regular croc clogs for over a year and the bistro fits slightly different.  The bistro is a little taller on the cup of the heel, has less air flow because of there are no holes, and it is less flexible than the normal croc clog.  I didn't like the lack of air flow so I cut a hole on each side of each clog.  This was easy considering there were already indentions.  The bistro overall is a very solid and nice clog.  I have worked in it for 2 weeks now.
1594202842|5.0|Those of us Americans of immigrant parents can relate to this Tiger Mother when i was a kid i got punish for practically anything but there was a method to the madness,it was cultural and it works.However,as an American parent my kids rejected my cultural approach of tough love and tight discipline but guess what my daughter graduated at the top of her class and is now working for a major Law Firm.I am not an expert in parenting,but the American approach is not working and as we all know in fifty years maybe less China and Indea will surpass us with more educated children espicially in those technical areas where American was once domminant...the world is changing fast and the Tiger Moms will be ahead of the game...Go Tiger Moms of the twenty first century kick butt and don't let them see you sweat.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I bought this for my 11 year old who loves Glee but we moved from the states and we can no longer view it on TV. I was super excited to find season 1 at such a wonderful price.
0805047905|5.0|My 17 month old loves this and makes me read it at least 5 times a day. She learnt to recognise all the animals in the book and can name them all. It is also a great little book that teaches about colours. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in buying it. The only thing I didn't like about this book was they start off with animals and then comes a teacher and children which un-relates to animals but as long as the kids love it, thats the most important.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been \\"doing Jillian\\" for 13 days now.  I know, that sounds dirty, but that's what it's come to now.  She's become part of my life, and I have recommended her to everyone.  I can find a million excuses to not drive to the gym after work, work out for an hour, and drive home, make dinner, yadda yadda.  But it's nearly impossible to find an excuse not to do a 20 minute workout AT HOME.  So, I've drug a ton of people down with me, and it's even more motivating when you have a group of people to commiserate with.    Let me start off by agreeing with most other reviewers and confirm...the first 1-4 days after you start this workout, sitting down on a toilet, and stepping off of curbs will be the most dreaded parts of your day.  You will definitely \\"feel the burn\\" as Jillian would say...a lot.    This video has 3 Levels.  You're supposed to start at Level 1 and work your way up.  Each Level consists of three circuits (3 min strength, 2 min cardio, 1 min abs - repeat 3 times).  It's completely doable and while you get your butt kicked...hard...you feel like you did about 2 hours at the gym in 20 mins.  She makes it a point that there's no resting because it's only 20 mins, and by making your heart rate go up and down while going through the circuits and not resting, this is what helps you shed the fat and gain muscle.    I started as a beginner.  One that really hadn't been working out for months due to pneumonia. So, I felt like I was definitely starting from square one.  Since one of the girls in the video does the \\"modified\\" (cough cough, \\"easy\\") version of most of the moves, I followed her for the first few days, then graduated to the \\"badass\\" version.  I really enjoyed Level 1 because I believe that the circuits are perfectly timed.  The second I started feeling like I'm going to give up or keel over and die, Jillian would say, \\"Okay, 5 more.\\" There's one time in the workout when she says, \\"Only a couple more,\\" and that's a bold-faced lie.  But I got over that.  Ifeel like if I spent less of my energy swearing at Jillian and cursing her name, I'd be a little less winded...but that's what working out is for anyway, right?    I'm now on Day 14, and day two of Level 2.  I feel like this workout focuses more on my core and butt, more so than Level 1, which I felt was A LOT of legs (especially calves).  Once I stopped getting sore from Level 1, I decided to (wo)man-up and move to Level 2.  There's a lot of plank work in this level which I'm still struggling with.  But I know it'll get better.  I wasn't able to do more than 3 girly push-ups at the beginning of Level 1, but by Day 12 I could keep up the whole time.    Right now I'm at the point where I feel so lazy for skipping a workout one day.  This is completely contrary to working out being rare for me before.  I've watched Level 3 from the couch (after already working out, thank you very much), and though it looks challenging, I know I'll be able to get there. You will surprise yourself at how quickly you progress with this workout.  She's no joke, that's for sure.  Although I don't own a scale, therefore am not too concerned about the poundage, but more how I look and fit in my clothes, I can't say that I've gained/lost weight.  I can say though, that my pants are already looser after 14 days.  I'm not following too strict of a diet (because if I had to give up nachos and popcorn I'd cry), but I am controlling my portions and being much more aware of what I'm eating, because after you burn all those calories in the workout, the last thing you want to do it eat it all back.    SO, I highly, HIGHLY recommended this DVD.  My goal is to work through the three levels of this DVD over a few month period, then get her Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism DVD (45 min workout) to do on the weekends, and stick to alternating between the three levels during the week.
0142403873|5.0|I love this book.  The lilting rhyme and steady pace have made it a favorite in our family.  My 4 year old loves to \\"read\\" it out loud, as he has it memorized.  Julia Donaldson does an excellent job writing books for children.  We read the book and the book... was... good!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am in moderately good shape and work out or run a few miles 3x/week. I wanted a quick, at-home alternative to working out with a trainer. I am on level 2 of this workout and find it challenging. I like the 3-2-1 setup, so you know where the workout is going and how far you have come. I have only been doing the video for a week, so I have yet to see real results. I plan on doing this video twice a week with one day of running 3 miles.

030746363X|5.0|I thought Tim did a great job with this book. He explores new avenues towards redefining yourself as a person, and while I can't yet state the effectiveness of it all (this stuff takes time), I do hold out significant hope for some of his suggestions. I am not a gullible person, have tried many exercise programs before, some very successfully. What is enticing about Tim's is that they are significantly more simple and less-time consuming, while still following some good science.

0446693804|5.0|A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks is simply a beautiful and moving piece of work. This is the book that made me want to be a writer and to capture the mystery of love with words. Every writer has a voice and Sparks shines with his own in this. This book is my favorite of his and the first one by him that I ever read.<br />The place is Beaufort, North Carolina. The time is 1958. Landon is a senior in high school who would rather be clowning around in the local graveyard with friends than teaming up with Jamie, the nerd and bookworm and straight-laced preacher's daughter for the annual Christmas play. Of course, the two fall for each other as they work on the play and help out the local orphanage. Only Jaimie is hiding a secret which may threaten their love and tear both their lives apart.<br />When I first read this story in the 9th grade as required reading, I literally couldn't stand it at first. But, as I kept reading, I rooted for the characters and lost myself in perhaps one of the sweetest love stories ever written. I have read it twice since then and consider myself a marginal Sparks fan. This coming from a 23 year old male may sound silly, but take my word for it, this book will not dissapoint.<br />Without question one of the greatest love stories ever told.<br />My Rating: five stars for a brilliantly constructed journey into the depths of life love and friendship that will make you laugh, cry, and smile again.<br />I want my whole family to read this book and if you're reading this review, what are you waiting for! Go check it out!<br />Also recommended: Message in a Bottle- Sparks' strongest novel, and the movie version of A Walk to Remember by Adam Shankman (2002.)

Do take a listen and add it to your Christmas library and gift list.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I, for one, was not impressed with the trailer for this movie.  I had never heard of the graphic novel at the time.  Basically, I never planned to go see it at the theater.  I don't know if it was the lack of marketing or maybe bad timing.       I will never base another movie off of just the trailer alone.  This is an amazing movie and I feel like I missed out on an amazing experience by not seeing it in a theater.  Edgar Wright(Sean of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) does an amazing job while completely changing gears from his normal style of directing.     At the beginning, the story itself isn't that unique.  Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera) has a girlfriend and he`s in a band.  He's kind of a jerk.  He finds a new girl that he likes better.  It's when he goes out with this new girl, Ramona(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), that things start getting interesting.     I'll admit, it starts off fairly slow at the beginning.  That changes all too quickly as the usual stumbling, bumbling Michael Cera(Superbad, Juno) turns into a martial arts expert that has to fight off Ramona's seven evil exes.  The visuals are extreme, as well as the soundtrack which revolves around a lot of the band`s songs.  Anyone from the Nintendo generation will get a kick out of these, as there are multiple times when various scenes will include an homage to classics such as Mario.       These fights are all done in a unique manner and surprisingly well choreographed.  Each of the evil exes are typecasted perfectly, in my opinion.  From Chris Evans(Fantastic Four, Captain America) playing the over-the-top bad boy, to Brandon Routh(Superman Returns) and Jason Schwartzman playing their roles perfectly.  Anna Kendrick(Twilight) and Kieran Culkin, who is hilarious in this, do great jobs as the main supporting characters.  Ellen Wong makes her major motion-picture debut and impresses.     If you are a member of the Nintendo generation(or just a fan of video games in general), or if you like music, or if you like comics, or are a fan of pop culture, or if you want to just have a really fun movie experience done superbly by the director, Edgar Wright, then you need to check out this movie.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|Okay, i loved this movie for many of the same reasons i loved the new True Grit...a long awaited return to \\"real movies,\\" story telling, dialogue, showcasing the plot and exceptional actor's craft of the Hollywood Classics! If the film industry is cyclic, like everything else, then Hallelujah...because we as an audience might be getting the BEST of films!<br /><br />The story of a dark horse evolving into the most remarkable Triple Crown Winner in the history of racing drives the film with ease (as it should), Secretariat has been presented before, but this film brings out the period as if in a time machine.. The cast consists mainly of the impeccable Diane Lane, playing Penny Chenery, a woman of grace and resolve, finding herself in an unsettling position. She can either passively retreat to her 60's role as a dutiful housewife and mother, or take the reins of her family's legacy---- and nurture a wondrous horse as a contender for the Triple Crown.<br /><br />Penny chooses to take the risks, much to the consternation of her family and the male dominated world or horse racing. She faces innumerable obstacles to her father's dreams but relies on her instincts to be true. John Malkovich is absolutely marvelous, playing the outrageous trainer, Lucien Laurin, whose wardrobe alone is dazzling in its outrageousness. His style and methods are not in sync with the racing set, making the whole sports miracle even more memorable. Another wonderfully warm supportive character is Margo Martindale, as Chenery's assistant, Miss Ham. The main character, (besides the horse, Big Red) is Ms. Chenery, a woman of quiet strengths and sincere resolve. Diane Lane hits her marks beautifully...a woman behaving unacceptably in this era, lacking family support, but holding faith with her band of misfits and maintaining poise, dignity and LOVE for a horse with more than heart. Their devotion to \\"Big Red,\\" an equine of questionable abilities in endurance, yet mystical possibilities and athletic prowess, proves that fairy tales do happen in real life...if you believe.<br /><br />Secretariat was a sports phenomenon, unrivaled, and unbelievably powerful in the director's (Randall Wallace)depiction of this historical marvel. Sets, costumes, background, casting and photography were of sentimental brilliance presenting the nostalgia of the 60's, behind the scenes training and politicking in racing, the adrenaline laced excitement of the competition, to include the jockeys and their invaluable skill and bravery. The series of building events culminates in the viewer's emotional rapture of seeing the extraordinary arise within our midst, without explanation or logic. Magical!<br /><br />This movie is fantastical, GREAT...OMG, Hollywood, please take note of the pattern. It, and others like it, are blowing away the mind numbing explosive, sex filled, profanity immersed, costly repetitions being made in the last couple decades. Thank goodness. Its about real folks, amazing events, a real tale of legend, miracles and jaw dropping awe. Kudos to every aspect of this movie... which truly belongs on the big screen...BRAVO!es that fairy tales do happen in real life...if you believe.

014241543X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I'm not usually much of an avid reader, but lately I have been because I've had a lot of spare time, so I bought this book based on the reviews and let me tell you, they were right. I am having trouble thinking of one bad word to say about this book (other than a few grammatical errors I found, which always are a little off-putting, considering that professional editors were involved), which says a lot for me because I often get distracted while reading or simply find a book too boring to pick up again once I put it down. This book was a page-turner at some points and the perfect book to read casually at others, and it makes you appreciate everything you have, because it forces you to look mortality in the eye. It's both heartwrenching and uplifting, and I cannot WAIT for the sequel OR the movie to come out. READ THIS BOOK! (before you see the movie!)
1416583432|4.0|Although much of what Horowitz writes may seem like common knowledge, because we've seen this behavior from our dogs, she gives credence to suspicion.  Yes, she tells of the meaning of dogs' body language, such as the wagging tail or the panting smile.  Though, Horowitz also tells of the watchful eyes of dogs that seem to study human behavior with much more diligence than we study theirs.  It is through this study of the human psyche that dogs know doing the wiggle dance makes people laugh, the waste basket is not a toy box, and making messes in the house is a no-no.           Throughout \\"Inside of a Dog,\\" Horowitz tells stories of her dog Pump (Pumpernickel) to illustrate sections and chapters.  Unbeknown to Pump, Horowitz monitored Pump's behavior for years, so she could gain knowledge and pass that knowledge onto other dog lovers.  \\"Inside of a Dog\\" takes humankind to uncharted territories, allowing dog people the chance to understand more about themselves and their world from a dog's perspective.
0446693804|3.0|I decided to read this book after having seen the movie, just for the heck of it, and while the book was good and I enjoyed seeing the story play out from Landon's perspective, I have to say the movie is better. The book has a heavy religious component to it, which definitely doesn't appeal to everyone (including myself) and tends to feel similar to how it feels when evangelical Christians shove God in your face to chastise you for something or show you that their way of life is better. Not to mention it was a little shallow how Landon turned from a regular teenaged boy who made fun of girls like Jamie, to a completely different person, because he fell in love with her the moment he saw her with MAKEUP on. In general I'd say that while the story is good, you might as well not waste your time on the book when you can just watch the movie.

0525423273|5.0|Words fail me. With this wonderful love story between Anna and Étienne (sounds dreamy, huh? You've NO idea), Stephanie Perkins was able to tap into those high school memories of shy glances and accidental contact that made your palms sweat and heart beat faster. Those moments you would desperately love to have frozen in time so you could revisit them over and over again.     Did I mention Paris? Descriptions dripping with so much decadence they compelled me to add this city that I've never before really wanted to visit straight to the top of my bucket list.     This book is, in a word, gorgeous. The best YA romance I can remember reading. EVER.
1594202842|3.0|...that is the question we are all asking ourselves and others.  In many ways, Chua is an admirable parent. No kudos to the kiddos for merely existing here, they are doled out the old fashioned way -- the way that made the United States -- they are earned.  The other way, the soft, over-caring, over-parenting helicopter way of 21st century childrearing may be a part of what is shredding American society and creating a next generation of losers who do not even realize how much they have lost due to having spent entire childhoods over-indulged by well meaning but hopeless ineffective parents.  Yes, she's the Tiger Mother and yes this is more about uselessly short lived marketing than, really , all else.  But Chua makes many salient points about how we as a society teach our kids to be entitled, personally irresponsible, blame everyone else for everything that goes wrong and, worst of all become unproductive unaccountable. It is sad and unfortunate and the collateral damage are some of the kids we are raising. The Asian theme song (they are better moms) is a load of crap.  I own what is ostensibly the largest private school advisory firm in the USA and I can safely say I work with as many Asian and Asian-American parents who overindulge every whim their kids could ever dream up as much as those that are Caucasian, African American or from Mars.  That is a by product of affluent society. We all place our hopes and dreams in our children who are our messages to the future but like all else we can overdo to the point of...my second point.  Did someone ask Ms Chua's daughters if they actually wanted a warts and all airing each pillowcase of the dirty laundry tell all memoir written about them.   They are not yet grown, they are teenagers.  Can you begin to imagine what their lives are like right now? This is a generation that is shunned by peers if they do not have a Facebook or an iPhone.  Imagine what happens when your mom writes a memoir that the whole world is talkingabout with descriptions of piano practice sessions that wind up virally nuclear?   What damage that has cause to these two girls, we can't begin to know.  This book is forever, and maybe not the fame, but certainly the fame.  My concern is for the daughters of the author and what they could be feeling now and how much it will affect them later and forever.  It doesn't seem fair at all.   That said, the book is an interesting read that contains among others, chilling moments.  In reminiscing about her own childhood, Chua tells us that in Chinese dialect her own father called her garbage and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree years later.  At the same time, Chua deems her parenting as successful and I for one do not doubt that.  But it's so...harsh.

0060723513|1.0|When approached with the idea of doing an all school read of the Mutant Message, I agreed. I was under the impression that it was a slightly fictionalized version of actual events. I also believed that it had been written by a journalist, though I now realize that was entirely a construction of my assumptions and bias. I thought that, like A Million Little Pieces, Mutant Message Down Under may embellish a few facts or even completely fabricate characters and events, but the quality of writing and core truth of the story would more than make up for a few flourishes of falsehood. What I found instead was a tome loaded with sentences barely recognizable as English, enhanced by a \\"gravy\\" (185) of convoluted figurative language and constructed on a foundation of 17th century \\"noble savage\\" racism cemented into a grotesque argument for new age philosophies, pseudoscience, and quackery.

0385341679|5.0|All I have to say is... UnK'VruckingBelievable!!! Ok, so maybe I have a little more to express.  I am petitioning Webster Dictionary to add that as a new word as a description for Karen Marie Moning's Fever series.    The Fever series is a phenominal fantasy world with incredible and complex characters that only Karen could dream up and express in the manner she did. The finale \\"Shadowfever\\" has been long awaited by Karen's Moning Maniacs and sooooooooo worth the five year wait. Of course, for those of you who are just now hearing about this series, once you start with Darkfever, you won't be able to stop. Just save yourself the trouble and buy all the books at once.    There is truly reading experience BEFORE \\"Fever\\" and AFTER \\"Fever\\". Karen has altered my reading expectations and ruined me for all others.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|We love Pride and Prejudice and have enjoyed every version we've seen, including its funny adaptation Bride and Prejudice. The acting, costumes and scenery of Lost in Austen are great. The story line has lots of potential, and the DVD uses enough of it to keep the story interesting to the end. However, the vulgar language of the main character and the choice of the author to turn one of Jane Austen's characters into a homosexual made it an easy choice for us to put this DVD into the trash rather than into our DVD collection.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|It's amazing.  Epic.  Beautiful.  I loved it from beginning to end. If you haven't started this series yet waiting for the end - to avoid cliffhangers - this is the final book, now go and enjoy!<br /><br />I've always been a little incoherent about this series.  Usually the most I've been able to manage is: \\"It's awesome!  Read it!  You'll love it! Read it!Read it!Read it!Readit!\\" I'll try not to devolve into that here today, though there's likely to be some squeeing fan-girl moments.<br /><br />From the start, Darkfever, this has all been about Mac's journey.  When we first joined her she was somewhat sheltered, a little self-centered, full of light, rainbows and love and absolutely comfortable with her place in life - which involved never leaving her small southern hometown.  Throughout the previous four books we've seen her worldviews shattered and her convictions tested.<br /><br />We've also had a lot of questions come up.  Honestly, I was a little worried how Karen Marie Moning was going to fit all the answers into a single book and not make it seem like one big info-dump.  Then there were my worries that my expectations were so unbelievably high that there was no way she could possibly produce a book that would live up to them.  I spent months trying to lessen my anticipation - without success - and then worried some more.  Happily, I needn't have worried at all.<br /><br />Karen Marie Moning manages to answer all the questions that need answering, as well as taking us on one hell of an emotional, action-packed ride.  I cried, I laughed, I grinned like mad, cried some more and by the time I was finished I felt like I'd taken every step of this right alongside Mac.<br /><br />I've spent over four years speculating on so many different aspects of the books, so I was a little worried that I'd have figured it out before hand.  And there was stuff I did figure out, which left me cheering and grinning because I'd gotten something right.  But there were more things that I didn't even come close to unraveling.  Which made me even happier.  Karen Marie Moning once said:  \\"I believe a really good story gives you enough of the facts so that shortly before the truth comes out, you're onto it, and hopefully, when the time is right in this series, you guys will know in your gut whether it's a baby grand or a couple of sofas pushed together, before I yank the sheet off the covered furniture you've been staring at for several books.\\"<br /><br />And she absolutely succeeded!  There's nothing I love more than a series that makes me think, and still doesn't let me get it all before the author shows me what's been hiding just below my vision.<br /><br />The author deftly shows us Mac's, at times chaotic, thoughts and emotions.  They're striking and hers and very, very real.  I felt each one with her.  And while there is growth in Mac, throughout the series and in this book, I feel that the author managed to do something spectacular in keeping the character true to herself.  She is who she always was.  Perhaps a little more stripped down, a little more 'savage,' but she's still Mac.  The same girl that got off the plane all those months ago looking for her sister's killer.<br /><br />All in all, it was a fantastic conclusion to the series.  For days afterwards the only thing I could say about it was 'It's Epic.  With a capital E.'  I still feel that way.  It had my brain, and my heart, engaged from beginning to end.  It's the best series I've ever read.  I couldn't ask for more than that.<br /><br />I've got to add one other thing - it's a minor spoiler, concerning a major character in the series.  ***Minor Spoiler***<br /><br />I've loved Barrons from the first moment he 'Ms. Lane'd Mac. Mac was often told to judge him by his actions, not words.  I took that advice to heart, and that's where Barrons took root.  He's not an easy hero.  He's not even an anti-hero.  He's absolutely comfortable with who, and what, he is.  He makes no apologies.  Wants no pity.  He's demanding, possessive, arrogant and at times savage.  He's the baddest thing out there, and knows it.  And in the end?  He doesn't change.  He's still all of these things.  He doesn't spout platitudes of love.  And yet his love is easily apparent in all his actions.  It made me sigh quite honestly.  How attuned they are to each other.mes savage.  He's the baddest thing out there, and knows it.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|Got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. He's been getting more serious about his running, and has trouble knowing how far he's been/pace/etc. This was the perfect gift! The website feature that the information uploads to is great. It shows exactly how far/where he ran/walked on a map and how fast he was going throughout the workout using graphs and gives your pace based on time running/miles run (vs. factoring in things like time where you're not moving because you're waiting for a stop light). The maps feature is just awesome. Also, he uses KM and was able to change it to that without looking at the directions, so its quite easy to use. Its supposed to have workouts programmed so the watch will beep to help with interval training, but I don't think he's tried this feature yet. Its also nice because it works anywhere in the world, it uploads wirelessly and you can log on from anywhere and look at your runs. I looked at my boyfriends runs and saw where he was going/how fast he was going - so you can compete...and you can't lie about it! Needless to say - my birthday is in two months and I've asked for this.
B000002JOH|5.0|I'll just make this short and sweet. I remember when this album first came out in my late teens. Such an amazing show of teen/young adult angst. There isn't anything I don't love about every single song on this album. Amazing work by an amazing group!!!

B00009MGGI|4.0|All the way through.  The concept and execution are unique, yet classic, and the lead performance is, truly, a masterpiece of arch, urbane villainy.  Francis Urquart seems thoroughly steeped in the Shakesperian tradition of evil-doers. I just found this set unopened at at sidewalk sale in my neighborhood for $5.  It's worth 10 times that in sheer entertainment value.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is a blessing! Seeing and hearing these two together is a delicious piece of modern music history. Each of their voices is like an old friend. Although the faces and hair have changed, the voices remain the same. Distinct but perfectly blended, together they reach into the deepest recesses of the human heart and offer a big hug. If you like their music, you'll love this DVD and CD combo! Our son got this for my hubby and I for Christmas. Aside from time spent with friends and family, this was the best gift we received all season!
B003VR5PPY|3.0|The game is solid, but there are too few puzzles. There are 9 rooms in this game and each has only  a few puzzles. The game play is minimal. This is assuming you play it multiple time to get to every puzzle.
0307266303|5.0|This is an incredible book.  Thanks for the great service!
B003W5C0VW|5.0|This is a very exciting dvd to watch.  The song choice is great as well as the audio quality.  This would be a good introduction to the band for someone just discovering them for the first time.  If you like Led Zeppelin's 2003 dvd release then you will definitely like this one.  I have to say that it's too bad they didn't 'involve' Mick Taylor with the band more because he is clearly a great guitarist and perfectly balanced out Keith's loose/sloppy playing.  Should have kept him around.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Bought this down at als army navy today, its pretty decent, i mainly bought it just because of the size of it, remember its a pocket sharpener which means it fits in your pocket, its a last minute resort as far as a sharpener goes. I like that it has a key ring hole. The only reason it got 4/5 is because it feels cheaply made with the plastic, but the parts that matter are solid.

006621131X|3.0|For those readers who are not artists, the memoir Just Kids by Patti Smith is like entering into an alien world. Smith writes with precision and clarity about her life in the 1960s and 1970s when she and Robert Mapplethorpe were friends and lovers and their art was not noticed. The starving artists scenario could have turned out quite differently, and is from the distance of their successes that we can appreciate the uncertainty of their lives when they were young. Smith's voice in this memoir gently brings readers into her relationship with Robert and the people, places and milestones of their lives. It's easy to understand why this book has been praised and has received major awards.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B0038QGXHW|5.0|what struck me first about this recording was the clarity of sound, and secondly how close haden's bass sounded as a near organic extension of jarrett's piano. the improvisations are deeply grounded in the jarrett musicology built up over decades. his versatility resonates. his grunting adds a percussive quality to the playing by the duo. harmonious, tranquil and mystical.  very peaceful.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I was 10 years old in the spring of 1973, and I remember watching each leg of that year's Triple Crown with heart-pounding breathlessness.  My mother and I always watched the Triple Crown together; she is, was, and will always be a horse person.  But 1973 was special; even a 10 year old could tell that.  That big, beautiful red horse.  His distinct personality and clear intelligence.  And his absolute love of running and his will to win.  SECRETARIAT was clearly a very special horse.  The horse of a lifetime, the champion of a century.<br /><br />This beautiful movie, SECRETARIAT, is the story of that magnificent red horse, and the very special people who knew him.  His owner, Penny Chenery, who knew he was special from the moment he was born; his trainer, Lucien Laurin, who just couldn't stay away; his jockey, Ronnie Turcotte, who knew how to let him run his race; his groom, Eddie Sweat, who knew what the horse was thinking; and wonderful Miss Ham, who took care of them all.  SECRETARIAT was born a champion, and these people believed in him from the very start, even when the rest of the racing world was against them.<br /><br />SECRETARIAT is a stellar film, with an incredible story, an outstanding ensemble cast, gorgeous cinematography, and perfect chemistry, between both people and horses.  The racing scenes are amazing; I was on my feet cheering wildly for \\"Big Red,\\" as he was known.  I felt 10 years old again, magically transported back to that very special spring.  My heart pounded during every race, even though I knew every historic outcome.  And that final race, The Belmont, which set records that have yet to be broken, the race that this horse shouldn't have, couldn't have won, but oh so clearly did, and with such style and aplomb, is truly magnificent and left me in tears.<br /><br />My husband and I truly loved SECRETARIAT; this film is now at the top of our list of all time favorites.  SECRETARIAT is the perfect film for families, sports fans, horse lovers, and, well, just about everyone!  Exciting and sentimental, beautiful and captivating, inspiring and heart-warming, SECRETARIAT should not be missed.  MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.t everyone!  Exciting and sentimental, beautiful and captivating, inspiring and heart-warming, SECRETARIAT should not be missed.  MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B004FPE4DK|4.0|Anyone who read my \\"Best Songs of 2010\\" article may remember McMorrow's name falling into the 12 spot with \\"We Don't Eat.\\"  Now, nearly a year after its release in the U.K., \\"Early in the Morning\\" has finally earned a release in the U.S.<br /><br />Recorded on his own while living in a cottage on the coast, \\"Early in the Morning\\" quickly sets the mood with \\"If I Had a Boat.\\"  Like \\"We Don't Eat,\\" \\"If I Had a Boat\\" starts off quietly, but gradually builds in both vocal strength and instrumentation as the track progresses.  Already a pro with them, these crescendos may very well become a trademark of McMorrow further along in his career.  Additionally, shades of Sufjan Stevens, Bon Iver, Band of Horses, and Iron & Wine all fill in McMorrow's mixes with a unique beauty that is very much his own despite the influences.<br /><br />As the album treks forward, McMorrow proves he isn't a one trick pony with tracks like \\"Sparrow & the Wolf\\" which adds hints of country and maintains an upbeat tempo throughout.  Although his more emotionally captivating tracks are the clear focus, the occasional upbeat flare adds a pleasant contrast to the album.<br /><br />\\"We Don't Eat\\" is an unbelievably beautiful track and is worth the price of the album by itself, but McMorrow's equally sung and whispered lyrics intertwined with a lush musical framework makes for an enjoyable album from beginning to end; creating a very promising debut for the young Irish artist.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Sufjan Stevens, Bon Iver<br />Track Suggestion:  \\"We Don't Eat\\"
B003XU75QG|5.0|I heard the Pretty Reckless for the first time on the soundtrack for Kick-ass (fun movie, btw). Googled them, found a few tracks on youtube, and ordered this disc about two days later.    And now I don't seem to be able to go for more than about 24 hours without hearing 'Miss Nothing'. Nice and LOUD.  :)    This won't go down in history as the most lyricallly profound album you've ever heard. This is just in-your-face tunes.    Apparently Taylor Momsen is on some TV show. She should quit her day job and just sing some more, IMO.

B002BSHWUU|1.0|First an foremost, I would like to state that the Beatles Stereo Box Set is excellent, in terms of packaging, music quality, as well as as a collector's item.<br /><br />Why only one-starred rating?<br /><br />Two reasons:<br /><br />1) When I receive the box set, none of the CDs were shrink wrapped.  I didn't notice anything was amiss until I got a replacement set.  The replacement set I received has all the CDs shrink wrapped.  Which leaves me to wonder, why was the first set I received not wrapped?  But hang on, I did NOT return the entire box set because the CDs were not wrapped.  Why I returned the entire set is reason number 2.<br /><br />2) CD 3 and CD 4 has the same CD!!  Huh?  What do I mean?  CD 3 - A Hard Day's Night.  CD 4 - Beatles for Sale.  But when I look at the physical CD, inside the sleeve of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"; the physical CD is \\"Beatles for Sale\\".  And inside the sleeve of \\"Beatles for Sale\\" is; \\"Beatles for Sale\\".<br /><br />Well, a box set is not a box set if the CDs are not complete.<br />I now have a replacement set, which is everything a-ok.  So I'm pleased.  That said, I had an issue with one of the online customer rep, which is another issue altogether.  But if there's a channel for feedback, I'd love to give that.
B003ZK58WM|2.0|I enjoyed Pillars of Earth. And I received this book as an unasked for birthday present(would not have purchased it for myself until the ebook came down to 9.99).<br />Having received it, and having liked some of Follet's other books, I started reading. No I did not make it to the end.<br /><br />The character development was poor. And while the book is historical fiction, there were too many pages of pure painful reading like a detailed description on how to make a locomotive wheel<br />at a factory. The main problem is the book is not about the characters, but about the events of the book. They completely overshadow the characters, and the author forgets that it is the character development that makes the reader interested in reading the book.<br /><br />But in Fall of Giants the characters are too shallow. The reader does not really care about them. And they just seem to be thrown in to provide Follet a vehicle to dump a detailed description of world events leading up to and during the First World War on the reader.
044656740X|4.0|\\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a fantastic read and can be useful for students studying business as well as those interested in starting their own business. I loved that this book emphasized the principles of finance and investing in a simple, clear-cut way, which made it very easily understood.     Kiyosaki really went above and beyond in writing this book, and is very inspirational and informative in his writing style. My only complaint is that the book was published in 1997 when the market was more optimistic to growth; therefore you must reevaluate the information presented to concur with the present state of the U.S economy.     Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a solid understanding of business fundamentals and wishes to gain knowledge of assets vs. liabilities in regard to Investing.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|This \\"Emma\\" is like a pretty butterfly that flits from flower to flower, pausing at times to be admired.  I like the music.  And the words are clever -- perhaps too clever.  They often spell out things that I would rather observe.<br /><br />My wife and I prefer the \\"Emma\\" of A&E with Kate Beckinsale.  It has its faults (Mr. Knightly is too severe), but I find it closer to Jane Austen and more satisfying as a movie.  The characters are richer.  They ring true.  The beauty of the A&E version is more like the beauty of a human face.<br /><br />You may well want to own both.  Check out the reviews of the A&E's [[ASIN:0767020308 Emma]] (1997) with Kate Beckinsale.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book starts off a little slow...I didn't think I would like it at all.  A friend encouraged me to hang in there because it would in fact pick up and get you hooked...thank God I listened to her!  Not only did it pick up (and it picked up VERY fast), but I couldn't put it down!!  I was totally engrossed in this book...it was like an addiction!  I recommend this book to everyone...it's a greatly written suspense novel, and I couldn't wait to move on to the next book in the trilogy!
B002VECM6S|4.0|This is an inspiring, uplifting movie based on the true story. I found the movie to have an overall positive and humorous mood to it, with a few intense, more serious moments in between. Acting is done excellently by all characters, especially Sandra Bullock. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a feel-good, educational movie to watch, good for the family! 3-4 stars for this Best Picture nominee film.
0307476154|5.0|As soon as I finished The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo, I couldn't wait to start this book!  It was so well written, and a great story...it hooks you quickly and doesn't let go!  Highly recommended, and I'm off to read the 3rd book in the trilogy!
0802473156|4.0|This book is great in providing an overview of the 5 important key elements in making a marriage work.  Out of the five, each person has one that they hold of greatest value.

B002O5M4SA|5.0|To be honest this is the best Blu-Ray purchase I have made. This is one of my all time favorite films and I can honestly say this version made it even better. There is tons of extra footage here and it adds so much more depth to the story. The extended version develops the characters more and helps sync the events that take place. For the price this movie is offered for on here there is no reason any one with a Blu-Ray player should not have a copy.
B0001N9ZKW|5.0|Ever since I first bought the vinyl album in the mid 1970s, this has been firmly in my list of favourite albums and remains there to this day. A definite 'Desert Island Disc' except that I'd be hard pressed to choose one track - the album is a complete entity. Song writing, vocal and instrumental performances are all top notch and I love the way the instrumentation is used to such great effect - accordions, concertinas, krummhorns and the brass band on the title track all complementing Richard's brilliant guitar work and Richard and Linda's affecting vocals. Having followed Richard's career fairly closely for near on 40 years now, this is an album I come back to time and again and never tire of it.  Now I've got the three bonus track as well!
B00005NNMJ|5.0|This is one of the greatest metal albums of all time. Every song, as far as I'm concerned, is a classic. Udo Dirkschneider has one of the most recognizable voices in the genre, and he belts out vocals that fit perfectly to the music. He also shows versatility by hammering out rockers like the title track and London Leather Boys and then toning things down a bit for ballads like Winter Nights. Wolf Hoffmann is one of the most underrated guitar players out there. He infuses classical playing with metal expertly. If you like heavy metal, this is one of the best albums out there. Highly recommended!!
B000UGG3A0|4.0|For those of you looking to break into Dropkick Murphys I would not recommend this album. I love it, but it's slightly more mainstream (if that's a possibility regarding punk music) than their past works. Instead, go for an older release like Warrior's Code or Sing Loud, Sing Proud to get a sense of their Celtic influences.    Echoes on \\"A\\" Street is now my favorite DK song. Why? Go see them play it live, watch & listen to thousands of fans scream, \\"Shannon I'm comin hooooooooooooome!\\" THEN tell me it's not a fantastic rip!     Play loudly...enjoy!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this little sharpener because I didn't have a portable sharpener.  I used it on a stainless pocket knife that I had and a Kukri machete knife that I had bought with it.  It handled both knives extremely well and the new poorly sharpened Kukri from the factory was given a nice razor sharp edge after some time.  Don't let its small size fool you.  It was a big hit at a Scout camping where everyone used it to sharpen their knives.  It has both carbide and ceramic sharpening to finely hone the edge.  I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a small pocket sized sharpener that packs a punch.
0060936223|5.0|There's something about Patti Smith that has always greatly inspired me. What a legend.    'Just Kids' is a captivating book.  I couldn't put it down.

We all should read this book, that's the least we can do for Henrietta and her family. Her story will forever be in my heart.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|This movie is too gruesome and is of \\"B\\" movie quality!  I know this has a huge political agenda which is not why I watch movies, either.  It has a great cast, so that's why I wanted to watch it, but I couldn't get through more than 45 minutes of this movie as it was too dark, too gruesome, too political and just too low class! I think there are much better ways of making your political point than making a gruesome movie!

B000VWYNOG|4.0|It's interesting to listen to the early tracks and see how his music has progressed and morphed over the years...This Cd, although not a complete catologe of his work, takes the listener down memory lane to his current possition as a great songwriter and bluesman..This is a definite \\"must have\\" as a sampler or intro. My only regret was accidently not buying the boxed set of the same name ( a confused issue on the marketers part), for just a few dollars more.
B0047SF41G|4.0|I started it thinking \\"Yeah... this is probably going to be pretty stupid.\\" I mean, while the first one is a classic, we all have to admit... it was pretty dumb. But as far as the Alien and Predator franchise type movies go, I thought it was well done. It's a Predator movie. It lives up to the series. Adrien Brody does a good job, so does the girl. It's cheesy. Lots of guns, lots of blood. Everything you would expect from a Predator movie. I'd say it's the best one so far.
0061730335|5.0|William Kamkwamba is an example of how one person can change the world.  He grew up in drought and famine stricken Malawi and at times lived on the verge of starvation.  When he was denied an education because of lack of money, he educated himself by reading books at the library.  He learned about electricity and wind power and by scouring the junkyards was able to bring electricity and water to his village by building a windmill.  I think this should be required reading in all schools.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|While this is a great little book, it was irresponsible for Amazon to just throw a Kindle version out there without doing some graphic cleanup first.

B001OQCV2E|5.0|Unlike most of my friends, I adore a good disaster movie and this one was a corker.<br /><br />The CGI effects are spectacular.  Better than any I've seen so far.  I've often wondered what would happen if and when the hot spot under Yellowstone National Park decided to go ballistic, and this movie gave me the opportunity of seeing it happen from the safety of my living room!  (Now someone just has to recreate the effect of the hot spot under the Bay of Naples--which includes the surroundings of the that city and Vesuvius--which is also an event waiting to happen!)<br /><br />One does, however, have to suspend disbelief with considerable force if you have even a rudimentary knowledge of geology, cosmology, ecology or physics.  I doubt, for instance, that with the speed of a nu&eacute; ardant the size that the Yellowstone mega volcano would probably produce would give anyone, even those within hundreds of miles of its immediate range, a chance to get away from it even in an airplane.  I find it difficult also to believe that the crust would be able to move quite that far or that quickly, though the end of Hawaii was certainly within the realm of possibility.  Nor given wave physics can I see a 24,000 foot tsunami topping the Himalayas.  I'm also baffled by how a ship might make it down from the Himalayas to sea level, though I think we are meant to infer that the Himalayas actually sank to sea level.  Though I think they \\"got it right\\" with respect to the numbers of humans needed to viably repopulate the earth after the disaster, I suspect the number of animals and the types of animal they saved was probably more viable in a Biblical rather than a scientific account of replacement.  Still, all this aside, it was a whopper of a spectacle.<br /><br />I did have trouble with the touching scene involving the decision to rescue the \\"ordinary\\" folks who were being left behind out of a sense of \\"humanity,\\" esepcially since these same upright folks had already condemned the other 6 billion of us to oblivion by withholding information that might have allowed us to make provisions for our own survival--like they say, though, knowledge is power.  There are, however, poignant last goodbyes aplenty, many scenes when a truly decent sort dies while a \\"bad\\" sort lives, times when even a \\"bad\\" sort lives up to a higher code, and the heartfelt moment when a little dog is nearly left behind but manages to make it just in time. Anyone who has seen the Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, Earthquake, Independence Day, the Day After Tomorrow and other similar films will recognize the format. Interestingly this type of film seems to come out in quantity during hard economic times.  I wonder what that says about our national psyche.<br /><br />My favorite character was the outrageous conspiracy-theorist/radio host played by Woody Harrelson.  Anyone who willingly watches as a nu&eacute; ardant approaches him is supremely out of touch with reality!<br /><br />Whopping good fun!oblivion by withholding information that might have allowed us to make provisions for our own survival--like they say, though, knowledge is power.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|I am a very big fan of Jane Austin and have always loved watching the Masterpiece theatre's versions of her wonderful books. I saw this movie several years ago and had been looking for it. Though I agree with the other reviewers that the previous people descriptions of the supporting actors and somewhat of the ordering of the film, I believe it was a very good adaptation of Persuasion. Though at first I was not very thrilled by Hawkins performance, as you get into the film, you start to see that the somewhat meekness she portrays is in fact just her way of trying to keep from having her sniveling invalid sister throw a fit. She, at ever turn, seems to try and keep her sadness at bay by trying to do good for others (just like so many of Austins wonderful heroines.) As for the Captain. He could not be more lushes. Though Rupert could at some times have done more facial expressions, there is no better scene then when he reads the letter. I agree with the others that her running all over the place was a bit ridiculous, but I don't even pay attention to her. For me, it is all about him in that moment. His voice, inflection and phrasing of the letter is so captivation and stirring, that I can't help but wish I was the crazy girl running my head off, for whom he'd written that amazing letter. Though there are some point where you feel there should have been some changes (or not quite so many) , I believe this movie gets by, actually, more then by on the wonderful charisma the two Mains seem to have together. The wonderful tension that resonates fits perfectly with what I believe the book had originally meant to portray. Despite other reports, I would highly recommend this movie, and I intend myself to be watching it again very soon.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|This thing is amazing. you can crank out anything from death metal to jazz(well, a little dirty jazz). turning up the tone and gain will give you balls to the walls hell riffage, though i wish the highs were a little higher, but then turning those same dials down and turning the volume up will give you a fairly nice clean sound(of course a coil tap always helps). All in all this thing is one of the best things i have ever bought for my guitar.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have been broadening my horizons beyond the typical boardgames (e.g. Monopoly, Risk, Axis & Allies, etc.) and have accumulated a pretty good collection. Settler's is my latest addition and so far the game has been hours of fun. The pieces are made of wood and very durable, the board fits together well, each hex, though similar, all have subtle artistic differences which add a rich feel to the game board. The game packs up easily and sets up even more quickly. The instructions are incredibly easy to understand, and the game play is loads fun. The games last about an hour, but as it gets down to the wire the match inevitably gets very heated, complex trades are made, roads are built to hinder progress, and the robber is used to sabotage your opponents. All in all the game is fun, well built and for less than $40 will provide hours of entertainment. Well worth the purchase.

What would happen if people went crazy while on this trip?  That is what Pandorum is about.<br /><br />To me Pandorum really defines Sci-Fi.  It is set in the future, with futuristic weapons and means of travel.  Everything that qualifies for a Sci-Fi flick.  Pandorum contains action and a ever so evolving plot.  When I first saw this movie I was blown away.  At every step there was something to change the plot.  I will be honest and say that I didn't see the end coming, the first time that I watched it.<br /><br />Pandorum contains a highly evolving plot with a serious life or death hero.  The villain was evil in his own way (it really isn't evident until the end of the movie how the villain played out).  The bad guys are labeled bad from the beginning, and become true bad guys as the movie continues.<br /><br />I really like the movie and would recommend it to anybody who likes Sci-Fi flicks.  I would also recommend the movie for people who want a nail bitter, action packed, mind blowing movie to watch.
B003ZYU3T6|5.0|Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times is one of my favourite films and arguably one of the best films ever made. The movie remains incredibly funny while also managing to be a significant artistic achievement  in cinema design and social commentary. For Chaplin fans, it marks the last appearance of his \\"little tramp\\" character and, not coincidentally, his last film without full synchronized sound.  The film does include music, sound effects, and the occasional voice, including a segment at the end where we get to hear the tramp sing a short nonsense song. However, as a film released 10 years into the sound movie era, the film is also something of an enigma. It presents perhaps the most famous silent film character in a film that purports to be silent, yet it features futuristic  factory machinery (reminiscent of Metropolis) and large close-circuit flat screen video displays that would have looked almost like science fiction back in the 1930's.<br /><br />This new Blu-ray release from Criterion continues their standard of releasing historically important films with significant audio/video remastering and a variety of enticing special features. However, in this case, Criterion is competing with an already excellent release of this film on DVD from Warner/mk2 in 2003. The new Criterion release mentions that the \\"new\\" transfer was created in collaboration with Cineteca di Bologna, who were also credited with the previous Warner/mk2 release. I am not sure if this release actually includes a new transfer or just an upgrade of the existing one to 2K-resolution for Blu-ray. I performed a side-by-side comparison of both versions, and the Criterion Blu-ray version contained noticeably better detail and superior contrast. However, it also contained a great deal more digital grain that I found a little distracting at first. This can easily be seen in the opening frames where the clock face that seemed so steady on the old DVD version now has a multitude of dancing pixels that give it a strange shimmering quality. As the film progressed, I became accustomed to the new graininess of the image and began to appreciate the increased detail. For the first time, I could see some of the horizontal wires used to secretly operate the \\"feeding machine\\" in the second chapter. Chaplin's face also looked a little older throughout. The old Warner/mk2 DVD version looked softer and textures, including faces, had a much smoother feel to them. I did notice some extra grit and fibres showing near the edges of the frame in the Criterion version that were absent from the Warner/mk2 DVD, so this does suggest that the transfer or at least processing of the transfer is different. Overall, I preferred the more detailed Criterion version but still think that a better compromise between the two could be reached with some more processing and cleanup of artefacts done to the Criterion version.<br /><br />Sound quality for both versions was similar with a slight nod going to the lossless Criterion mono version. The old DVD also includes a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack absent from the Criterion version. This is not really worth the effort for a film with 1936 sound technology.<br /><br />As far as special features go, the Criterion version really shines. It adds a new and informative commentary by Chaplin biographer, David Robinson. The old DVD included only a six-minute introduction by Robinson. Other features from the old DVD are also carried through to the Criterion Blu-ray. These include the 26-minute \\"Chaplin Today - Modern Times\\" featurette, two deleted scenes of very minor importance, some theatrical trailers, and a 10-minute Cuban documentary about peasants seeing Modern Times as their first movie experience. The old DVD includes some additional materials that are not included on the new Blu-ray such as photo/poster galleries, plus some vintage featurettes from the US government and Ford motor company related to assembly line labour, and a performance of \\"Smile\\" by Liberace. None of these is a major loss.<br /><br />New to the Criterion version are two excellent \\"visual essays\\" which are essentially  a series of stills (many from the galleries on the old DVD) with substantial and informative commentaries by two Chaplin historians related to the making of the film and the locations used. There is also a very interesting new featurette about the visual and sound effects used in the film. It includes some fascinating explanations of effect shots presented in the film, although their very detailed explanation of a glass matte shot used in the roller skating scene does not seem to take into account that the camera moves during the sequence.<br /><br />Also included is a very interesting interview with music arranger, David Raskin, taken from an old Laserdisc version of the film. I was glad to be able to see this again. Finally, an old Chaplin short, \\"The Rink\\", and a home movie with Alistair Cooke, \\"All at Sea\\", are included. These are available elsewhere but are presented here in superior quality (the former) or with an additional interview (the latter) not available elsewhere.<br /><br />Criterion also includes a nice 36-page black and white printed booklet with chapter stops, cast and credits, plus two informative historical essays.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice package. The film presentation is more detailed than it has ever been in any previous release, although some additional digital manipulation of the picture and cleanup of artefacts would be welcomed by my eyes. The bonus features are extensive and interesting, although I would like to have seen more of the image galleries (including stills, script elements, publicity and financial material) that have been included, albeit at much lower resolution, on previous DVD and Laserdisc versions. My only gripe with the bonus materials is that both on disk and in print they refer to poor or at least \\"diminished\\" box office performance of the film because it did not have full sound. All vintage box office information I have seen related to the film indicate that it was one of the top five grossing films of the year. Then or now, it is a fun ride.major loss.

0321701763|4.0|The content of this book is excellent and it's a superb introduction to Photoshop CS5. It employs a 'learn by do' method mostly, which is staple across the CIAB series. The idea is to whet the appetite to learn more by actually applying the program in practical examples rather than explaining the every function and feature of Photoshop (after all, that's what the manual that ships with the program is for right?).<br /><br />So anyway, on to the eBook lesson file issue that is causing such controversy on Amazon. This solution holds at least for all Classroom in a Book editions of CS5 programs.<br /><br />Buy the eBook. Then, on your chosen reader, scroll to the END of the eBook and scroll back page by page. Very close to the end you will find a section in caps titled WHERE ARE THE LESSON FILES?<br /><br />Very clear instructions follow about how to go to the publishers website (PeachPit) and download the full files associated with that particular text.<br /><br />Granted, it would've been smarter to list these instructions at the beginning of the book rather than the end, but the good thing is they are there and fully included with each Classroom in a Book eBook for CS5.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />EDIT 26-1-11: My guess is that given that the files are not to be given away freely until purchase, they are placed at the back of the eBook so that they are not included with the sample first pages that are given away freely as incentive to buy.
B002ZG980U|5.0|One of the best movies of the year. Original, thought provoking, and worthy of turning your phone off for two and a half hours. Hans Zimmer's music score is superb (when has it not?) and Christopher Nolan establishes himself as a superb director in this fast paced thriller. The last few seconds you need to keep watching and if you did not catch it, watch the movie a second time.

B0048ZJOP0|5.0|I played this album from Dec 24th to New Years!  It is great feel good music to cook your xmas dinner to.  I was constantly bopping my head and singing along with Mariah.  I also had this in the background while we opened gifts so it is playing in our xmas video.  This is another classic xmas album from Mariah, and you'll enjoy it for years to come.
B003TML0VO|2.0|Definately made for the promotion department, not for music lovers. A piano playing the guitar rift on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"? They are an experienced band that can cover lots of songs, but the band at your local watering-hole can probably do about as good as the week tracks on this CD. Carlos rarely seemed inspired and mostly left his MoJo at home. I guess Clapton is God.
B004KPYQXI|5.0|A really great episode.  It had enough packed in it that they could made it a two episode plot.
B000002V1D|4.0|I've been a fan of Duran Duran since the early 80's.  I've been to several of thier concerts and have all thier albums and DVDs. Simon is the apple of my eye. I agree with most of the other critics.  This is a very good album and a great come-back album.  But \\"Drowning Man\\" and \\"Shotgun\\" do ruin the flow of this album.  But I'd like to add that \\"Drowning Man\\" does hurt my feelings.  After all I am a U.S. citizen and I do love my country and feel that this is the best country in the world.  Duran has a handful of songs putting down this country, such as \\"Edge of America.\\"  I understand that most Europeans don't like th U.S., but does Duran need to insult my love of country?  I do not like political bands.  I listen to music for several reasons, but not to get my political beliefs from them.
B003Y5H4SY|4.0|Good one, the first of The Night Chronicles, suspenseful and scary but also gets you thinking; good story by Shyamalan but he turns the directing over to John Erick Dowdle, who does a very stylish job with a good assist by cinematographer Tak Fujimoto who is brilliant.  Breakout role for Chris Messina who finally gets to play a strong hero part (he usually gets cast as a jerk) as the shrewd and efficient detective who is battling his own demons.

B004GNYGTI|2.0|Just so bad it is difficult to point out exactly what is wrong with this film. Poor story, lame acting, terrible special effects, save you money and watch Jason Bourne again..
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|This album showed that Nicki Minaj could be more than just the rapper she showed the world on her mix tapes. She showed us that you can be sensitive and like different kinds of music. Everyone says the music is too pop and R&B, but if she likes pop music why not try that. Why stay in a box for the rest of your life because thats what's \\"cool\\" in hip-hop. I think its a great album my favorites are     -Last Chance  -Did It On 'Em  -I'm the Best  -Fly  -Moment For Life  -Check It Out
B003INBNXO|5.0|1.  To describe this as a martial arts movie is not doing it justice because it's a biographical movie about master Ip, whom I didn't have the faintest idea who he was until I happened to stumble across this masterpiece of a movie.  For those who are hesitant about watching a foreign film, don't worry about it.  This movie is well acted, the writing is excellent, the storyline is inspiring and there's some great action scenes... it's definitely one of the best films I've watched this year.  For those who are into martial arts, I would say this is one of the best movies ever produced.  For those with zero interest in martial arts, you're still going to enjoy this film because of it's story etc...  A definite must see.
030746363X|5.0|This is a big book, but I charged through it with gusto, and did not read it page by page. I like that the author encourages you to skip around. I also like to experiment on myself and it was exciting to see how far he went to find answers to a question most of us have: how to get the body you want.     This book is inspirational. The plan is easy to do. The diet works for those who eat out and travel. So do many of the exercises. But the most important thing is - it works amazingly fast. Eureka! I have found it!    And bonus points for believable before and after pictures.
B002ZG997M|2.0|1.  This film isn't worth the time to write a lengthy review.  Bottomline: the most incredulous of storylines but ok acting... but again, the story just doesn't make any logical sense... unless your half awake at 0300.  Yea, I know Denzil Washington is in it, it has to be good; that's what I thought and that's why I viewed this film.  After I watched this DVD, my thought was then \\"what in the world possessed Denzil to make this film?\\"  Bottomline: skip it.
B001TODCII|5.0|This movie is not for bleeding heart liberals!! Two young Americans are kidnapped by white slavers to be sold into the sex trade & the father of one goes to rescue them but HOW he does it is the best part. When one guy tells him not \\"to take it personal\\" that he sold his daughter to an Arab for rape--he tells the guy not to take it personal as he puts a bullet into his head!! It shows the misery & killings of other girls, so it's not a pleasant movie but realistic in what lowlifes will do for money!! But it has an ending to cheer for when he rescues his daughter from the Arab on his boat!! Hint: he does NOT read him his \\"rights\\" and arrest him!!
B001HN694K|2.0|1.  Although I tend to like most Johnny Depp films (esp Charlie Chocolate Factory etc...) and this film was visually amazing, in the end a good film is based on solid writing and solid acting... which this film sorely lacked in.  Bottomline, the movie seemed that it had everything going for it (special effects, the classic story, famous actors)... but it was just plain boring, I'm mean really boring.  Out of the three family members who started to watch this film, no one finished it.  Even my kid who waches almost anything, was so completely bored with this film that he just went on to do other mundane things.  Bottomline, if you value your time, skip this dud.
B0041T4OHQ|5.0|This is a great book.  The illustrations are wonderful, there is enough repetition and silliness for small children, but not so much that an adult would mind reading it every day for 2 years straight.  The lesson is good and NOT heavy-handed, which will make the children want to read the book for themselves when they are ready.  I have sent several copies to relatives as baby shower gifts and purchased one for my therapy dog to bring to \\"Reading to Rover\\" events.  Four paws up!
0385341679|5.0|Definition of a great book: the one you cannot put down and start all over again as soon as you are done with it!and again....  I've never been more addicted to a series than with this one...  Without giving anything away ,I just wanna say it was great watching Mac (finally) growing up and the ending wasnt(thanks KMM) utopian. It was a GOOD ending but it also gave me the feeling that we might get another book....?please?  P.S. I am sooooo gonna read all the books AGAIN...after i am done re-reading this one for the n-th time!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I am an avid fantasy reader, but until a friend handed me this book and told me to read it, I had never heard of Patrick Rothfuss. This has got to be one of the finest fantasy works I have read in a very long time. If Patrick can continue to create at this level, he will rival the greatest fantasy writers of all time.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I didn't realize that the ZBB could do better than Foundation but, they sure did. The music isn't constrained to lables like saying it is country or Southern Rock. The only only way to lable it is calling it good music.
B0035WRY7C|4.0|This is the first book in a series of adventures about Alex Rider, a fourteen-year-old reluctant spy.  I guess I would call it \\"James Bond for the Harry Potter set.\\"   It's very exciting, and the action is quite intense, but the violence is definitely toned-down for kids, and not graphic, which is greatly appreciated by this parent.  I also appreciate that there is no \\"language.\\"  Refreshing!  [I'll never understand why authors insist on using foul language in their books.... it's simply not necessary.  I suppose it's merely a sign of bad writing, as if the author can't come up with a better way for a character to express themselves. (It's also true of \\"real\\" people who use that kind of \\"language\\".... they sound ignorant and uneducated, not to mention boorish.)  It's a cop-out.]  So, I was happy to let my 11-year-old son read it, and he loved it, naturally.  Actually, so did I.      I look forward to reading the next one!      Age recommendation:  11 - 16 years
1591843162|5.0|This book is a mixture of common sense and inspiration.  It is a wonderful reminder that when we strive to be above the common and better ourselves, the real reward is a better life, better outlook, better relations with others and in general a better way of being.  This book is for anyone who wants to discover their full and true self.
B003DRWX9I|4.0|I just heard about this album, when someone called in on Howard Stern and mentioned a video with Fergie. I had no idea that Slash had an album out. It's a sad state of affairs when a legendary rocker can't get the word out.<br /><br />I immediately checked out the video on youtube, and was blown away. Fergie kickin butt on a rock tune?? Sure I saw her tear it up at U2 Pasadena Rose Bowl show, but this was something else. An original and it sounds like she was made to sing. She delivers and so does the entire album.<br /><br />I never heard of Myles Kennedy before, but I am now a fan. This guy could easily replace Axel as the GNR frontman. Every single song on this album is a gem, this is the first album in a very long time, where I listen to every song and I listen to the ENTIRE album over and over.<br /><br />If you have the slightest interest in rock music, please support this excellent effort by a true legend of rock. Slash fires on all cylinders on this one and hopefully he can lead the charge of a new era for Rock and Roll, where all the best from the past 40 years can lend their talents and make rock come to the forefront of music again. It's been a long time since rock ruled the music landscape, and with this it could easily start making it's rise to the thrown for a new decade.<br /><br />Mark
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|\\"Sex and the City 2\\", just like its predecessor, is one end-less commercial for haute-couture and the kind of lifestyle to be found in the \\"Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous\\". The wealth and materialism exhibited and glorified is nauseating really. So nauseating in fact that you cannot possibly take it seriously. The girls are obscenely wealthy, have equally obscenely wealthy life styles and there is not one person in this movie who is real. It seems like in the world of Sex and the City, there are no ordinary people - everyone is a page out of \\"Vogue\\" magazine.     Carrie has exactly what she wanted with Big, who somehow lost his spunk ever since he confessed his loyalty to her at the end of the series. He is docile and quiet and acts like a neutered, obedient pet who just nods agreeably every time. It is kind of pathetic actually. Carrie herself has not accomplished anything really. All she seems to have been doing over the years is shopping and going to movie premieres and high-society parties. Charlotte is the same spoiled brat who makes cookies in vintage Valentino skirts and can always find something to whine about - even when she both objectively and subjectively got everything most people could only dream of. Miranda has lost a lot of her edge and cynicism, which made her interesting and endearing and instead she has turned into Charlotte. Urgh. The only one who hasnt changed and still has the morals of a pornstar after a 600 man gangbang, is Samantha. But she too is annoying at best and has turned into a caricature of herself, juts like all of the characters. None of the thoughtfulness, wit, and vulnerability we got to know and love all these years. It seems like the writers just picked a few themes (like fashion, shoes, the extravagant life-stlye, the man-chasing etc) and blew them up into gigantic circus-sized objects and written a story around them. Everything and everyone is faker than the silicon and Botox drowning Hollywood.     Sex and the City was always a champion for the single gals, the power of single, successful women who know what they want and are not willing to compromise it so they fit under some label. Yet in what has become the conclusion to their stories, they all got a man (except for the one who never wanted one) - and did what they had to to finally fit under the label; which basically tells me that all the talk about not needing a man and being an independent woman was just that: talk until the waiting period is over and they all have a man, so that life and happiness can finally begin. Yipeee...        That being said, I must admit I dont understand people who dump on this movie, somehow expecting depth, a plot and character development. Come on. This movie is about materialism and the best clothes, friends, houses, china and vacation spots a man's cold hard cash can buy. That's what it's always been about. Even the writers admit that no real-life person could afford Carrie Bradshaw's lifestyle and couture choices. Four dollars a word in a 250 word column and shopping Manolo Blahnik's at 600 a pop every week? Come on. They never made a secret of that. Michael Patrick King in the DVD commentary for Season 4 said they often show close-up shots of the shoes because they know that's what the audience wants to see - straight or queer. So give me a break and stop trying to make of this movie what it isn't.       I watch it for the sheer aesthetic pleasure of it all and so should anyone else. It is entertaining, like a live fashion show in Milan and as a fashion aficionado myself, I was delighted with the fashions, styles and coutures presented. If you expect some awesome movie with an actual story and believable characters, or a message even, then skip this one. The audience for this movie are funky women who love fashion and gay men who love watching these funky women sport these fashions. This movie is not social commentary of any kind or is about anything really. Its superficiality and materialism, the main protagonists of this movie, are hidden under nothing but a thin veneer of fake and misplaced emotional struggles by a bunch of narcissistic, supremely fake, vain and vacuous individuals.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The series should have ended here. I've heard that's how Kripke intended it to be, and if that's true, he was right. This is the ultimate showdown for all of the potato chips. Sam and Dean face off with each other and Lucifer himself. Where do you go after that?    This is the culmination of Kripke's 5-year vision, and it's masterfully executed. I must say Lucifer wasn't the best \\"bad guy\\" as that title goes to Death. His character was fantastic.    In conclusion, if they had ended the series about 30 seconds before this season ended (ie cut out the last tiny little scene), this would have been one of the best, most cohesive series ever. That said, I'm still watching the show, but how do you follow facing the devil?
B001IHJ97E|5.0|Great movie, I remember going to see it in the theaters, but what spurned me to get it was watching Inception recently, this movie was really the beginning of that kind of conceptual story, very cool.<br />Thanks,<br />Glenn from Warrenton, VA
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|When I first started reading this I thought it would be action  packed and interesting like the other two. But sadly it wasn't. It was more like Twilight, It wa Katniss chosing what guy she was going to end up with. It was a dissapointment to   the series. It finally got a little good at the end though. That was the only reason I gave it 3 stars.
B001B0G5WA|4.0|The packaging is neat, it has the same sleeve the original release came in. It's also a nice high quality record, it's heavy. My copy had no issues sounding damn near perfect. Highly recommended to those who are fans of this record or the Beach Boys.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is the second pair of headphones I bought.  My botfriend tryed them and I ordered him a pair also.  They are great for when I am working out.  I do not like earbuds they always fall out so these are perfect for me.  Best headphones!!
B00004YLIU|3.0|First thing to say is that it's great so much effort went into this. The packaging and the quality of the vinyl is great. But...    This product is defective. On side one of record two there is an issue with the first track, Optimistic. In two copies I've had now they both had the issue. The problem is a swooshing sound that somehow shows up right before play and continues for about 30-40 seconds into the track. Past that everything sounds great. So having already sent it back once I've decided to just live with it. I don't find it likely the issue will be fixed or even that there will be more runs in which to do a fix. If you want a new copy of this on vinyl this may be your only chance.    edit: Jan-26-2011    Ok the same swooshing effect is also on one of the first records in the middle of a song. I think I remember this being an issue on the other record too.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|After reading some of the feedbacks on the I Dream Of Jeannie Bottle DVD Set I thought the cardboard Bottle was going to give me trouble but I was wrong.It could have been made in plastic which would have been better idea but this was fine,the DVD's held in pretty good and the quality of the set was better than the TV shows I grew up watching.The First Season B/W show were so well done they do look like the real color.The other shows almost come out in 3-D quality almost like watching a Play,maybe its my new TV set I also bought at Amazon (Which I love...Pann.42 Inch) but I am enjoying my new DVD set and Im a big Barbara Eden Fan since 1966.Go ahead and Treat yourself to it,you will not be sorry.

0061989142|5.0|I love this book! Only half way through and i have already put so much of the helpful advice into action. I recommend this book to anyone even if you didnt like The Hills, When i purchased this book i had never watched an episode of The Hills, now i own all the seasons on dvd. Very Helpful, points out the obvious fashion do's & don't but also goes into dept about each topic. I will be shortly purchasing Whitney Port's book; True Whit When it is released February 2011
B003DZX3US|5.0|Putting aside a review of the film itself (which is, of course, excellent), this DVD is a great copy.  The video and audio quality is really stunning, even in standard definition (we don't have a Blu-ray player, so I can't comment on the quality of that disc, but it's hard to imagine how much better it must look when the DVD looks as good as it does).  The DVD also includes, in addition to the extra features, a new (restored?) scene/musical number, which was a cool surprise.  At $30, it's a bit pricey for just one movie, but getting the DVD and the Blu-ray is a really good value in the long run, so probably worth it.
0812973992|5.0|Let The Great World Spin is a novel I have resisted reading.  As a native New Yorker I was extremely hesitant to engage in even a tangential \\"9/11 novel\\".  I didn't think anything could even remotely capture the actual experience, the loss and sorrow of that day's events.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  LTGWS is brilliant and evocative--a work that lingers in one's memory and emotions long after the final page.<br /><br />Most wonderfully, the struggle and the sorrow is not focused upon the horror of the WTC destruction. It is Phillipe Petit's glorious tightrope walk, skip and hop from tower to tower, and the lives of a handful of people below that serve as metaphor of precarious existence.  Others have, in wonderful detail pointed out what is marvelous about this book and I happily join in the chorus of praise.  In addition though, I can add that having lived in NYC at the time McCann describes, the author (who couldn't possibly have been there) seems to recall it effortlessly, with pinpoint accuracy, brutal honesty and great heart.<br /><br />All of the splendor and pretense, the grit and the degradation of a city that seemed to be teetering on the brink of a great collapse are described in powerful, steely prose.  Those who have complained about McCann not following strict short story forms, or who upbraid him because he doesn't seem to like policemen, I am sorry to say can't see the forest for the trees.  The various chapters are not short stories, and shouldn't be judges as such any more than one part of tryptich should be evaluated apart from the rest.  As for the grouse about not liking cops, read the dedication of thanks.  It's pretty clear the author is describing his characters feelings about police.  Not his own.<br /><br />As for those who say that the voices of some characters didn't ring true, I say, not so!  Each of them--Claire and Jazzlyn, Tillie and Corr, Gloria and Sol--as different as can be--rang true and clear to me.  I hope everyone will give this book a chance.  I thought the New York described in Let The Great World Spin was gone for ever.  Wrong again.  It lives in McCann's chapters--beautiful, ugly and hopeful still.e.

B000VPUIA6|1.0|The UK \\"Parlophone\\" (PAL format) pressing of this 2 Disc \\"Help!\\" DVD is perfect - whereas I am one of at least 3 people (see the added comments to this review) who have found the USA \\"Capitol\\" label (NTSC format) pressing to be faulty. I bought the Capitol label Special Edition of \\"Help!\\" direct from Amazon in November 2007, but I didn't get around to watching it until January 2011 - and I was very disappointed to find the feature film disc to be completely unplayable after the first 40 minutes (even though the disc looks pristine). I tried it in several stand-alone DVD players and in my PC drive. It was far too late to request a refund, so instead I went to Amazon.uk and bought the Parlophone (PAL) pressing and it works absolutely perfectly. (NB: in Australia all DVD players play both NTSC and PAL discs, and most will play discs from all DVD regions, because there is no legal impediment to \\"region free\\" players).<br /><br />So I must rate the USA \\"Capitol\\" label pressing of this DVD product as one star at best (because it is severely faulty) - even though the film itself is worth at least 4. Amazon reviews are absolutely for expressing an opinion about the quality and features of a product, as well as for expressing an opinion on the aesthetics of the product. Some great films have been released in a shoddily manufactured or poorly packaged DVD format. Two other Amazon customers report they experienced the same fault with their USA copies of \\"Help!\\" - there will no doubt be many others who have not complained. This information might be of benefit to other potential purchasers - who might be well advised to buy instead the Blu-Ray edition which was released in June 2013 - at a fraction of the price of what is currently being asked for the 2007 DVD edition.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|I love this movie!  Good to see someone make a movie that doesn't follow the evolutioninst theory of   when men and dinosaurs lived.  This is a more Biblical chronology.  Very cool special effects and the story is exciting!
030746363X|5.0|Tim has done it again: this book is content rich, with specific actionable steps to create better results faster.  Killer content, and all in one place- it just doesn't get any better!
B000P0J09W|4.0|A wonderful movie that we enjoyed with our children years ago. Now we can watch again with our grandchildren when we get them!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The movie Pride and Prejudice definitely does justice to the Jane Austen novel. People who are fans of the novel and writer won't be disappointed with the translation of this movie. The characters are very well chosen,  bonus feature are interesting and it's a lovely love story as well as a moral lesson- 'don't judge'.
1400052173|5.0|I finished reading this book in about 3 days.  I just couldn't put the book down.  An incredibly interesting and well-written story about the contributions of Henrietta Lacks.  I agree with many of the other commentators so just my quick thoughts on why this book was so wonderful:    1.  Non-fiction book that almost reads like a novel  2.  Teaches people about a very important contribution to the scientific community  3.  Honors the life of Ms. Lacks by telling her story in an honest way  4.  Makes you think about some of the ethical issues / history surrounding medical testing  5.  Well-written and researched book    These types of books makes reading so much FUN!  Definitely buy this book!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD really surprised me! The 3-2-1 system used is genius, just when you feel like you can't go on, it changes, giving the tired parts a chance to rest. Jillian is also very encouraging and the comments and tips she gives are clever and useful. She also explains why we are doing certain things, which I also found to be a good thing. I also liked that there are modifications for the more difficult moves. Even though I did the easy ones I was still very stiff the next day. This DVD is definitely a great investment for anyone who wants a great workout but maybe doesn't have lots of time.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This was my first exposure to the chili peppers and they've been my favrotie band ever since.    I adore every song (minus porcelain of course) and consider this album to my theme for high school. I highly recommend it to anyone searching for good music.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Being a huge Jane Austen fan, I think the movie accentuated the subtle humour and clever dialogue of the novel. Gwyneth Paltrow IS Emma, the rest of the casting was done very well and makes for wonderful viewing. All in al, one of my all-time favourites.
B0041KKYCY|1.0|This has to be the worst acted, worst written movie ever, even the 1978 original version was better than this!! Hollywood you suck at movies!
0307272702|5.0|This is more of a science book than a diet guide. 85% of the book talks about the conventional mindset of why we think we get fat. Taubes carefully and methodically deconstructs the conventional wisdom and spends a lot of time explaining why it is just plain wrong. I think this amount of argument was necessary as what he is really trying to do is to tell us that everything we have ever been told about diet and weight loss is wrong. The last 25 pages or so gives you a simple dietary guide and what to expect about changing your diet to align with the facts in the book. I have been following those simple guidelines for about 6 days now and have lost 7.5 lbs without exercise. So far, I am a believer.
1439107955|1.0|I should have known better, I hate biographies,much prefer memoirs.Perhaps the doc' would have been better writing a memoir of cancer.  What I hate about biographies is that they tell me all kinds of things I'm not interested in, just like this one does, and I have to wade into page after page skimming until maybe I find something that strikes me.  I gave this one star maybe because no one else has and to point out and warn the average reader that this is not a rousing or that interesting a book, and maybe they should save their money and find something better.  In the right hands this could have been a fascinating story, what is missing most of all here is what could have been a riveting story,instead, what you get is an overwritten text, full of historical facts with irrelevant anecdotes about the researchers. Hundreds of pages should have been cut, making this book at least half the length. But the publisher knew it had a hot topic, didn't care about editing it, too expensive and they'd have to cut the price of the book.And what a waste of the doc's time to write all this, he could have been doing something better than losing himself in so much research that lands with a thud.  I'll go on skimming, I hate that, to try and find some gold in these mounds of excess filler. I'm not a specialist, I don't care about all the etc's, and etc's, and etc's he fills this book with.  Who did he write this for, certainly not a patient, we're all potential patients, and that's the point of view that should have been pursued.
0307476154|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire is just as spectacular a follow up to The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo!It takes place a year later then the first book and we find out a little more about Lisbeth Salander! I think you will agree that Stieg Larsson is one of the best ever crime writers, no doubt from his vast years of experience writing about dangerous subjects in his home country of Sweden for Expo. In this second book you can tell he feels more comfortable in his writing. He continues to find new ways to surprise his readers with new twist and more mystery! You learn more about the characters and your thirst to devour the pages increases tenfold! I find my self saddened that this series of books ends too quickly just as Stieg Larssons life did! Too young! I look forward to his third book! The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|there are no words to describe how much i liked this book. even if i tried i don't think i would do this book justice.  i will tell you one thing, i was given a defective copy and i was missing thirty pages toward the end. so i jumped in my car and drove to borders where i plopped down in the aisle to finish the book with tears in my eyes.
0811866351|5.0|I borught this book for my boyfriend for christmas because he adores anything Disney. (who doesnt lol) Its a wonderful book, Good price and its vivid colors make it really fun to read. its a nice big book that will definitly keep you buys for hours. For those of you who like to collect stuff like this its a great buy.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|Considering this was bought for my son and we watched it together I even liked it.  He said see Mom I knew you would like it too.
B001TW69J4|3.0|Perhaps I expected too much out of this album, given all if its 5 star reviews.  After listening to the album I have to say I am disappointed.  While technical skill is apparent, many tracks seem to lack cohesiveness as well as a sense of direction. I am a fan of prog/tech metal, and the best of the genre know when to breathe. Unfortunately, many tracks on this album do not.      I did enjoy the composition 'Modern Meat', but it could have been played much more musically and cleanly.     For musical tech/jazz metal check out Exivious, Gordian Knot or Canvas Solaris.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Snaps easily to the kit lens provided with the Nikon D3100. Small enough to fit in a side pocket of almost any camera bag. Lens cap is easily removed and reinstalled without disturbing the lens hood.
0316044695|5.0|I read this book over 2 years ago and I still think back to how amazing this story is.  Anybody that is even semi-intrigued by military and special forces stories will be absolutely enthralled.  Even if that's not your cup of tea, you will respect the heroism and sacrifice of this true story.      The book itself is well written and you are immediately sucked into the life of Marcus as he aspires to be a Navy SEAL.  From the training to the battles to the main mission, the life of a Navy SEAL is brilliantly described in full detail.  The author does a great job of focusing on the important stuff.  Never will you find yourself bored or uninterested in any part of this book.      I wish I hadn't read the book 2 years ago so that I could read it for the first time right now.  I highly recommend this book.  This was my first review, hope it helped.
B004498KPU|5.0|I am thrilled to have all of Michael's short films together in one collection plus some bonus videos from The Jacksons. The only annoying thing is instead of being a full screen the picture only takes up a square in the middle of my tv. That is so annoying. I wish it were full screen. It does say on the package that it's formatted for HDTVs so maybe that's why. I haven't played these DVDs on an HDTV yet. Regardless of that I still think this set is worth having for any MJ fan!
0596009208|1.0|I purchased this book to start learning Java as a beginner, and was very disappointed. This book is not well written to just pick up and learn Java from. Far too many of the exercises in the early chapters of the book demand previous knowledge not included in the book to complete. I regret buying this book.
B0029LHW68|5.0|Nowadays most bands don't take the time or effort to put out a good album let alone a great one. For most bands, they think they need to put out as many albums as possible and make as much money as possible before people get sick of them and their popularity goes down the toilet, which leave very little time for actually making the albums good; HOWEVER, This Is War shows the enormous amount of time and effort Jared, Shannon and Tomo put into making this record one of a kind.     A Far cry from 2005's dark and reflective \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" album, This is War takes no prisoners and comes at its audience with a ferocity that alludes most albums today. From the opening notes of \\"Escape\\" to the final tones of \\"L490\\", this album tells a story borderlining that of an epic feature film. The music is atmospheric and riveting, pulling the listener along for the ride whether they like it or not. The album showcases the band's talent as they have grown as musicians, lyricists and performers.     My Personal Favorite Songs-  Night of the Hunter  Hurricane  Alibi  Stranger in a Strange Land  Closer to the Edge
B001EN71DQ|3.0|While not bad, the prequel series, I feel, relied a bit too much of effects and not enough on character development and story line; in comparison to the earlier made movies.  It seemed weakest around the central female character, who should have been a much better-developed personality and character to really carry off the role, I believe.  One small detail that didn't dovetail between the 2 series' was that in the prequels, the twins' mother died in childbirth, while in the later series it was claimed by Leia that she remembered her mother some; which would be virtually impossible, for an infant mere minutes old, particularly recalling her character as a mother.  Also the relationship of the couple who raised Luke was erroneously related between the 2; a step-brother is not an uncle in truth.    But maybe those details don't bother others; I would like to have seen the stories remain faithful throughout the entire sequence.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|So browsing Amazon one day I came across The Vampire Diaries:Season One. I had never even heard of it or read the books. I am a True Blood and Anne Rice kind of girl. So I bought the first episode just to give it a try. Oh my! It's now one of my guilty pleasure! The only thing I can grip about is that yes this is a show that the CW makes into a slightly teenish show. But its enjoyable. Damon is amazingly cast, as well as Stephen and Elena. You will love this show!
030746363X|3.0|But the book is a little oversold I think. This of course is the nature of Tim Ferriss, so it's not a surprise.
B000FBJAOG|2.0|if world war z was a five coarse meal with every kind of decadence you could imagine then the zombie survival guide is the toilette paper you would use to wipe your a$$ with when you are done digesting it.  just kidding.  as i have said before when i read something i try to think about what the author was trying to do and then consider if they have accomplished it.  to take a page from the zombie survival guide i am going to create a list and assign each bullet with a rating.  you can decide if it fits the bill for what you are in the mood for.<br /><br />as a:<br />  *parody to other survival guides conveyed with unbroken character in the most sarcastic tone (which i think was it's purpose) it gets 5 stars.<br /><br />  *cool novelty to put on your shelf that adds character to your zombie collection and will be picked up by you or a visitor and smiled over while being thumbed through it every now and again it gets 5 stars.<br /><br />  *side splitting comedy it gets 0 stars<br /><br />  *entertaining read it gets -1 star<br /><br />  *as an ebook it gets -5 stars (you can not put an ebook on your shelf and giggle every time you glance at it.)<br /><br />  having been in the military i have read many manuals and guides and the zombie survival guide is right in line with them.  drawn out, boring and in many cases insulting to your intelligence.  which, as i said, was the point.  meaning brooks hit his mark.  to poke fun at the survival nut jobs.  i would have rather spent my money on something more entertaining or moving but to be honest i would have eventually purchased this book solely for it's novelty.  just wish that i would have been able to find it at half priced books for that purpose.
B00005955I|1.0|All I want to say is that the 2 hours spent watching this crap was totally wasted. This movie was neither thought provoking or entertaining. Disappointing to think this cast saw some value in putting this one on their resume. I am trying to think of a worse movie which I have watched, but can't come up with anything..........
0307346617|4.0|what i like most about this book is that it traverses pretty much any scenario, location, terrain, ethnicity, environment or what ever else you can think of. if you are a fan of zombies you know all to well the stories about farm houses and shopping malls and in turn you want to see the zed heads in different situations.  being a zombie fan, and getting tired of the same old scenarios, i liked having multiple \\"accounts\\" to read.  there are accounts from house wives, military personnel, mercenaries and that little old lady you sit next to in church.  the story travels all over the world to give a perspective on how people from other cultures handled the zombie threat as well.  if you have ever wondered \\"what if a zombie.....\\"  your probably going to see how that would play out.<br /><br />as a reader you are given a certain amount of time with each of the characters.  some long some short but in either case, because of writing style and content, you feel the ever important connection needed to actually care for them, be glad when they succeed and cringe at their loss.<br /><br />  the one thing that i could have done without is the political mubo jumbo.  it does not completely overshadow the book, and in some cases it is important to understanding how the infected could spread through out the world.  it's mostly a personal thing that kept me from going all the way and giving the book five instead of four stars.  with that being said i have read a few zombie books and few come close to being quite as entertaining.  after reading certain portions of this book i sat stunned at the prospect of what the character had to go through.  i would set the book down run over the ideas and what they meant for the character and then re-read it.<br /><br />  all in all i give max brooks a lot of credit for undoubtedly doing a great amount of research to complete a very well rounded and entertaining piece of work.
B00000DI06|5.0|I am a real Rutter fan.  I love both his music and his conducting.  But my love for his Requiem is a deep love that I will not be able to fully express.  While Rutter is very good at writing catchy little tunes, his Requiem goes way beyond being merely interesting.  It is a piece overflowing with wonderful soul.  It deals with the tragedy of death, but it never loses that essential ingredient - hope.  The opening movement, Requiem Aeternam, contains a marvelous melody that leaves me fighting the tears every time I hear it.  It is incredibly sad and moving, but never despairing.  The following movement is entitled \\"Out of the deep\\".  With an amazing solo cello, it full of raw sorrow.  Pie Jesu is tremendously relaxed and soothing.  With a soprano solo, this is without question the most famous movement from the entire Requiem.  There is still a strong feeling of gravity, and there is still grief, but hope reigns predominant here.  Then along comes \\"Sanctus\\".  This is the only light-hearted movement in the work, and the one that it the most representative of the composer's more typical works.  But in the following movement, Agnus Dei, we once again enter the world of grief and woe.  The piece builds to a painful, almost excruciating climax, as if though the mourner was trying to come to grips with the stark reality of death.  The following movement, The Lord is My Shepherd, could not be more of an effective contrast.  It is incredibly peaceful and soothing, even more so then \\"Pie Jesu\\".  With a marvelous oboe solo, it is almost unbearably touching.  To close things up, we hear the \\"Lux Aterna\\".  This is the most bittersweet movement of the whole work; there is a tremendous amount of sorrow, but also an equally tremendous amount of hope.  Like all truly great Requiems, the work leaves the listener hanging, mourning yet full of hope.<br /><br />I cannot possibly recommend this album highly enough.  It is an intensely gripping work that is sure to leave the listener wiping away the tears.the tears.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|i was really pumped when i got my first set of these, sounded great for the price. after a few days of playing i noticed that the left ear had a slight blown/buzzing sound on the low bass sounds hardly noticeable, but i paid for new working equipment and this was faulty. i said OK, i will go ahead and exchange them for a second pair no big deal. when i plugged in the second set, the left can didn't work at all except for a completely blown sound. the right ear is the same, except i can hear the game behind all of the blown buzzing sound. i really did like these but turtle beach has proven to me that they are incapable of making a decent pair of cans. if the second set wouldn't have ended up being a COMPLETE PILE OF CRAP, i would have been quite happy with them. overall these things are great IF you manage to get a set that works... two thumbs down for turtle beach, VERY disappointing.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I got this season for a steal when i combined it with season 4. Supernatural is a great show and season 5 takes you on another crazy journey straight to the end.
B000063DIH|4.0|I don't know why most people dislike this album. Sure it isn't a classic like \\"Number of the Beast\\" or \\"Powerslave\\", but it's still a solid album. It is one of the first Maiden albums I ever heard so maybe that's why i like it so much. Anyway, I would still recommend checking it out...
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I though it would be better in weight and the sharpener would not feel cheap. But it does hold up pretty well to the knive I used it on and keep it in my day pack for when I am out with the scouts or hiking on some trail so that my knives stay sharp and to sharpen other peoples knives in the scouts camp outs or hikes.
B004AP9W46|1.0|This is one of the worst books i have ever read. I was so disappointed.  It started out like any of the vampire chronicles but quickly lapsed into absurdity.  It is hard to believe that the same woman wrote this book.
030746363X|5.0|Not only does Tim's book \\"4-Hour Body\\" have incredible, groundbreaking information on how to reshape your body, but it also helps readers generate the motivation where failure is not an option for their bodies. Many people who have for their entire lives written off ever having a sexy body have come to find themselves seeing their bodies as something under their power, not the other way around. If I ever meet Tim I'll buy him a drink or two.

030746363X|5.0|The 4HB is an incredibly interesting book and can be used by anyone willing to self-experiment to find the right dose that works for you.  Not a cover to cover read, more of a manual of what you're looking for.  Ferriss does a great job of explaining at the start of the book that you can delve as deep as you want into the actual science behind the book, but that is not required reading to be successful.  I've started the SCD diet 2 weeks ago and have lost 13#'s of fat.  Read it...
0375842209|5.0|This is my new favorite book! It was moving and funny and sad and beautiful. The illustrated parts were brilliant and lifted this book out of the \\"usual\\" and into the \\"Extraordinary\\" for me. The \\"Death as Narrator\\" is not a cutesy device, as it might be in a less skilled writer's hands. The book is sometimes very funny, but it is all in the context of the situation and never seems gratuitous. I don't understand why it was classified as \\"young adult\\" fiction, however. I think this designation only limits its potential audience. And EVERYONE should read it. You will remember it long after you close the book. \\"I am haunted by humans\\"... and I am haunted by this book. (But only in the very best way.)    \
B0045DO8NI|5.0|I am so glad I bought this greatest hits compilation.  She is an amazing artist, with an excellent career already.  Glitter in the Air is one of my favorites.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|GREED!! and stupidity.  Most of the cost of a book is in the materials, printing and distribution.  What possible justification can there be to charge more for an ebook that a hard cover???  Time for some publishers to go away!
030746363X|5.0|This book is simply amazing. It has rocked my world, and I am never looking back!    Simplicitiy: I have eaten twice as much as normal, worked out 1/2 as much as i normally do on my MAINTENANCE routines, and I've experience the best results I've EVER had. I hate diets, yet this one is so easy. The workouts are intense but fun, short and incredibly effective (note - recently a pretty girl in my gym was with her trainer, but when she saw my workout, she said: 'shouldn't I be doing it that way? That looks like an awesome workout.')  I was so pumped.    Results: I have never met my 6 pack, and i would say i am 2 weeks away, after just over 2 weeks of a combo of slo-carb diet and Geek-to-Freek with 1/2 the portions of supplements that tim used (although i don't think you even need the supplements to get nearly the same impact). I'm down 15 Lbs of fat and put on 3-4 lbs of muscle easy with no cravings and literally 1/2 the gym time of my maintenance(!) routine. Went from 178 to 169 in 3 weeks and you can see a lot more definition - i've been to the gym 6 times, which is the same, if not less, than usual but half the time of a normal workout.  I am still working on perfecting the Pose running method, but i have never(!) run that fast with as little effort before - it feels like you are flying.    Value: This book is full of so much amazing info, that i photocopied 10 pages to carry with me at all times and those 10 pages are worth 10x what the book cost me.  You may not use all of the material in this book (remember Tim spent a decade compiling the info) but so many things i use from it on a daily basis are so easy (cinammon in coffee instead of sugar, ice pack on neck, water with lemon before meals, 60-90 seconds of air squats or pushups before/after meals) are enough to make this book worth 10x the money. And the interaction with the website is so great/fun that it feels like a huge encyclopedia of info, not just a 500 page book that you can't wait to put to use. And recall tim is an effeciency expert, so there's no wasted words here.  I only wish i had this book when i was a skinny geek in high school or a fat beer gut guy in college.        Conclusion: Follow the book and it will change your world, for $20. To me its worth a fortune in terms of time-saved, effectiveness, knowledge, etc. THANKS, TIM!!
B0029LHW68|5.0|This is War is the 3rd album from 30 Seconds to Mars, presenting once more the struggle of living and dying. In each album, they present this theme in a different way, both in the lyrics and in the melodies. The lyrics show a more mature band, specially in the amazing \\"Night of the Hunter\\". Musically, I have to talk about \\"Closer to the Edge\\", with beautiful guitars and drums, and also the success \\"Kings and Queens\\", with its beautiful melody. The album brings yet another impossible to miss songs, like \\"Vox Populi\\" and \\"Escape\\". In the end, it's a great album, that combines joyful with the deepest of sadness, and that makes the album one of the greatest ever.

Beware of the 'collectible Cylon' as mine looked more like a Power Ranger and nothing like the Cylons in the old or new versions of the show (or the one depicted in this advertisement). I'd look for something else if the collectible item is the deciding factor in your decision. Who knows, someone may have wanted the Cylon only and regifted the item after the switch.

As with many historical films, the production is wonderful at turning back the clock. The film covers the period from 1926 to 1939, when the King makes the titles speech.  It was interesting to note how frightening it could be to face a microphone with the blinking red light and the instrument itself strung inside a metal frame with springs.  The announcer, at the beginning of the film, preparing himself by gargling, spraying his throat and measuring his distance from the microphone makes it all seem like a chore just to say a few words.      The film owes its success to the first rate performances given by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush but there are also equally memorable supporting roles. Guy Pierce fills the role of Edward VIII very ably portraying him to be more of a playboy then a future king. I am sure that many would say this isn't a well-rounded portrait of Edward but what does come across is his dissatisfaction with the protocol and duties that being a future king entailed. Timothy Spall was a good choice to play Winston Churchill and Anthony Andrews, who rarely appears in films, was an excellent Stanley Baldwin. Michel Gambon played George V exactly as I picture him: a cold parent.  Helena Bonham-Carter is well cast as Queen Elizabeth and her acting is flawless but it is a role that focuses on her husband rather than providing depth. Eve Best made an impressive Wallis Simpson even though she only had a brief couple of scenes.  I will remember the party scene when she sends Edward to get a fresh bottle of her favorite champagne.  Derek Jacobi (as the Archbishop of Canterbury) and Claire Bloom (as Queen Mary) were good to see even in such small roles.     The screenplay is historically accurate, even down to the use of some private notes kept by Mr. Logue that were found shortly before shooting began. The only fault with events was that Winston Churchill was more of a supporter of Edward and not in favor of abdication and the royal family supported Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policy instead of war. The King's Speech is a film I would like to see again for the inspirational story and also because it is a beautifully made story.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|My sister in-law loves this cd. No skipping, rec'd on time and it provides hrs of entertainment for both myself and her.
1594202842|4.0|I was so ambivalent about this book. Part of me appreciated the writer's honesty and the understanding that this would be a controversial book. It appears that a fair number of readers see this as one woman's advocacy of Chinese parenting methods over those practiced in the U.S. But the front cover of the book hints at the real meat of the book  - and I quote - \\"It's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old\\". For those who think the book advocates one right way to raise children, particularly traditional Chinese parenting styles, the words above reveal that no one parenting method works for all children, as the author herself discovered.<br /><br />I could not stop reading this book and I'm betting that many who bought this won't be able to resist it either. It has garnered enough buzz and controversy to skyrocket onto the bestseller list. I also couldn't help cringing about the restrictions Amy Chua's children faced, day after day, year after year. She often had to put up with disapproval from other parents, including one woman bursting into tears and leaving a party early in shock at Chua's revelation about shaming her daughter, calling her \\"garbage.\\" When she refused to let her children play with other kids or go to their homes after school, other parents felt snubbed or confused.<br /><br />Chua's children were held to a strict regimen for practicing piano and violin, expected to excel in school, and put their best efforts into everything they did. No play dates, television, computer games, sleepovers. Unlike so many children who practice playing the piano for up to an hour a day, Chua's daughters often had four or five hour practice sessions, especially before a major recital. If they complained, she scolded them or even called them bad daughters. This may seem relentlessly harsh but there are cracks, moments of doubt, that grew stronger for Chua over time. Eventually she faced a cataclysmic confrontation with one daughter.<br /><br />Perhaps part of Chua's parenting style came from her own admission about having difficulty enjoying life. Her primary source of gratification came from her children's accomplishments, at least from the perspective revealed in this book. Chua writes in detail about the differences between Western and Chinese parenting styles. Another important theme that reoccurs in this book is how \\"parents want to do what's best for their children.\\" By American standards, Chua's style may seem cruel, degrading and even horrifying. I often felt sorry for her daughters as I read of their rigid schedules and lack of choice about how to spend their time.<br /><br />But I also recognized how the writer evolved and had second thoughts. She did change and soften to some degree. She admitted this during interviews on NPR and other shows as well as in parts of the book, wondering if she was being right. One of the most telling parts of the book was when she contrasted the Western view of childhood (as a time for enjoyment) with her own belief that children should be trained to build character and invest in their future. Immediate happiness for Chua's children was secondary to helping them excel. By Chua's standards, the only way to ensure that her children were prepared for the world was to force them to conform to what she felt was in their best interests....until they would (hopefully) want to succeed, coming to realize that their mother was pushing them out of love.<br /><br />While I never got to the point where I agreed with Chua's parenting style, I do agree with her that parents struggle to raise their children as best they can. We wonder when to push and when to pull back.  She makes clear that there can be cultural differences when it comes to parenting and that she isn't always as sure as she seems that her way is going to result in grateful, successful children. One of the more controversial sections of the book may be her assertion that sheis \\"sure\\" that \\"Western children are no happier than Chinese ones.\\"<br /><br />My personal take is that the author was caught between how she'd been raised and what she felt was best for her children. Unfortunately, this books does feed stereotypes of Chinese parents being overbearing and demanding.  I also recall that some Chinese parents who called in to the talk shows were critical of Chua (the author), feeling that she perpetrated the worst stereotypes.<br /><br />Chua's methods did produce \\"success\\" -depending on how one defines it. One daughter did demonstrate early talent as a musician and was accepted into prestigious programs. Would she have done this without her mother's rules? It is doubtful. I don't define \\"success\\" as getting my kids (most of them now adults) to become \\"prodigies\\" but as someone who helps encourage them to find their talents and pursue them. But I understand that my beliefs are influenced by my culture, how I was raised, and the attitudes of other parents with whom I relate.<br /><br />I didn't find Chua's parenting style to be one I'd want to emulate. But I think the book is definitely worth buying and reading. There are parts of this book which may make you angry, especially when Chua attacks sleepovers and play dates (which she does full tilt). She also notes how \\"Chinese parenting does not address happiness\\" but also confesses that this has worried her. She is not totally rigid.<br /><br />I do wonder about the scrutiny she, her husband, and daughters will face (and may already face) because of this book. Jed, Chua's husband, is very briefly described (for the most part). Instead, Chua comes across as the domineering parent and her husband the one who primarily lets her have her way. He does complain when her behavior seems particularly disturbing but eventually seems to back off.are no happier than Chinese ones.\\"     My personal take is that the author was caught between how she'd been raised and what she felt was best for her children.

B0017YWG2S|5.0|Spent tonight,1/25/11, rather than the STOU speech, watching the Tom Jobim  DVD, Waters of March. A good trade overall, and particularly for the duet with Elis Regina. I can't deny that I am in love with her. Elis and Tom is worth its weight in whatever is worth something at present.
0525423273|5.0|This story was so freakin' cute! It was as sweet as eating a nutella crepe (yum!). I really enjoyed this one and it was refreshing to read about a relationship that goes from strangers to friendship to something more serious. I liked watching that development as it gave the romance a more genuine feel.    First off, I love Anna. She's the type of girl I can see myself being friends with and she reminds me of all those times I ever visited some place foreign--that lonely and lost feeling. I totally empathized with her. Etienne was very swoon worthy--charming, British/American/French all rolled into one! Although, at times he did upset me, making me scream at the book: \\"Break up with your girlfriend already, you imbecile?!\\"    I also really enjoyed that these characters had flaws and quirks. It made them more developed and allowed for them to grow to learn and care about each other, for these quirks and flaws to have special meanings to each other. I thought it portrayed an honest relationship and the characters felt so real that I could imagine them out in the real world, still together. This is the kind of book that makes you think: too bad it's fiction. Oh, and it makes you sigh in wistfulness. I can't wait to read what Perkins has next to offer!
B0041CGP02|5.0|Bon Jovi is the best band in the world and this CD proves it.  I love it.  I play it everyday at work, I work out to it and I listen to it in my car.  Believe me, you won't be disappointed.  They rock!!
B004G6009K|4.0|Our kids loved it.  Even our 7 year old (almost 8) son.  Some of the reviewers have complained about the slapstick comedy . . . I think that's why both the girls AND the boys liked it.  It's not overly girly, but girly enough for our 4 1/2 year old daughter to love it as well.  Our 3 year old son loved it too (and he won't usually sit through any movie other than Cars and Toy Story).    I have to admit that Rapunzel's fight with herself after leaving the tower was a bit odd, but I don't think it ruined anything.  Mother Gothel was a great villain . . . almost too great.  She is VERY manipulative and I almost thought it was too much for a movie aimed at younger children.  Mother Gothel's cleavage was a bit much.  I mean, it's a kids movie!      I thought this was MUCH better than most of the recent Disney movies (It seems like Disney has tried to reach a different audience and has gotten cruder and ruder and just lost the whole Disney feel the last several years (Bolt, The Incredibles, Shrek Forever After - awful!, etc.)  I am torn about the Princess and the Frog.  It was kind of good, but had strange undertones (for instance, I don't think they should do voodoo in a kids movie!), so it's not in our house.  Anyway, this seems to feel a bit more like a Disney movie (while still feeling updated).      Overall, we really enjoyed the movie.  Much better than most that have come out recently!  We'll buy the DVD when it comes out.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|If you are a Johnny Cash fan.... scratch that.... if you have any inkling or even the smallest appreciation for real music you'll mess your britches when you listen to this CD. Buy it! Save it to your hard drive, IPOD, flash drives and anywhere else possible so you will never be a day without it again. Seriously. You won't believe how good it is.
1594202842|5.0|Readers who do not enjoy this book or are quick to put it down simply did not get it. This book is not about how Chinese parenting is better than Western parenting! It is simply one mother's memoir about her old world Chinese parenting style and its effects on her \\"sense of entitlement generation\\" daughters. I felt for Amy because I have a similar background and I struggle with the same parenting style conflicts that she has experienced. Overall, I thought it was a warm, funny and entertaining book.

B001KEGRC0|1.0|This has several fabulous panoramic scenes filmed with IMAX cameras.  But much of the rest is a mix of political statement in search of a story line or perhaps a story line in search of a political statement.  What might have been???  Can you imagine how great this would have been had they spent the entire time with wonderful photos of the unimaginable beauty of the Grand Canyon and rafting the Colorado River.  This video didn't come close to it.
B0012GMZMW|5.0|I love this cd it's the greatest cd ever perfect music to share with the one you're with whether you are looking for love or when you're with your boyfriend or girlfriend that you have nothing else to play, this is the perfect cd to get you in the mood. Thanks Steve Augeri.
B004E547D8|1.0|Very disappointed  in this version I did not know you had to by the special edition so you could get DTS High def version. You only get the plain Dolby digital version with the single disk. I think Amazon could have made that clear.    Just FYI
B0013FSXSC|3.0|Pic quality is good, especially the close up shots. Julia Ormond and Richard Geer look splendidly sharp, the night battle scenes crisp.    Storyline, watching it many years down the road, seem somewhat corny now. And fight choreography is not like what we get in movies today. The background castle scenery also looks noticeably fake under this sharper picture. But nevertheless enjoyable, rekindles old memories.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's debut album is one of those rare masterpieces that practically rewrote the rule book when it comes to how to play rock music. Sure, rock music was always loud, but with van halen, they really brought it up a notch with their energetic live shows and groundbreaking guitar techniques which revolutionized guitar playing. However, none of this would have been successful if Van Halen couldn't write good songs, but this album proves that not only can they write good songs, but they can write songs that stand the test of time over 30 years after its release.     This album opens with one of the most monstrous guitar riffs ever recorded, and that pretty much sets the tone for the whole album. Its full of great riffs, catchy chorus, and most of all, fantastic instrumental skills that in my opinion, as a whole group, goes unmatched. Probably the most distinguishing factor about this album is that its alot of fun. After having so many serious british rock bands, it was a breath of fresh air for most people to have van halen come along with the party all night attitude which pretty much ruled the next decade.     However, its the production that deserves the most credit here. The sound is fantastic. The majority of 70's recordings sound rather dull and boring to me, but this sounds like it was played live, and has a more ambient and spacious sound than most records before it which really set it apart. Of course, in the 80's they really took this into excess and make everything sound like it was being played in HUGE arenas, but the same sound or even a similar one was never captured by another band. They seem to exist in their own bubble and stand out from the crowd in a huge way, at least until David Lee Roth left the band.     Basically, if you are looking for a unique, catchy, fun, and overall rocking album, then give this one a try. If Running With The Devil doesn't win you over, then You Really Got Me (Kinks Cover) and Ain't Talkin' Bout Love most definitely will.
1594202842|5.0|Just saw the author on The Colbert Show after reading it... It's a fantastic read and a modern glimpse of Chinese parenting, and has great parallels with tradition western styles of parenting.    Worth the money if you are in to Eastern culture or just want a new way to think about raising a well adjusted child. 5***** all the way!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Choosing a favorite Celtic Woman album is impossible. I have never been able to do so, and I probably never will. God has blessed these ladies (especially one of them) with gorgeous voices. This album is lots of fun, although perhaps it is a bit less \\"Celtic\\" than some of their other albums which is the only downside. Linked to this album, there have been many answers to prayer. I can hardly believe that I got to experience this show live and that Celtic Woman sang The Song which I asked God if he would let me hear live. Of course, there was a twist. But my prayer was answered!<br /><br />Enjoy!
044654759X|4.0|Normally, Nicholas Sparks books are overly sentimental and depressing.  This one is refreshingly upbeat despite the difficult subject matter.  In it, a quiet young woman named Katie moves to the small town of Southport, North Carolina and takes a job as a waitress in the local restaurant.  At first, she keeps to herself, but eventually forms a friendship with her neighbor, Jo, and with Alex, a widowed store owner with two young children.  Alex breaks down Katie's natural inclination to be private and alone through sheer kindness and determination.  As Katie lets her defenses and becomes closer to Alex and his family, she starts to believe that Southport could be a home rather than simply a temporary resting place.  To find a real home, however, Katie must come to terms with her past and trust Alex enough to help her build a new future.  This book has trademark characters almost too good to be believed and plenty of heartwarming, sentimental moments.  But it also tackles some dark subject matter, when the dark secrets from Katie's past come back to haunt her fragile new life.  This book is as much a thriller about a woman who must face down a terrifying past and break out of old molds as it is a romance about new love.  The combination is entertaining and much preferable, in my opinion, to the subject matter of some of Sparks' prior books.
030746363X|4.0|I liked Tim's first book, needed to lose a quick 10 pounds, so bought and read his second.  Lost the 10 in two weeks and became addicted to the kettle bell swing as an additional benefit.    Will buy his third.  Good job Tim!

It was very intriguing and had me at edge of my couch the entire time.  Yes a few questions remained unanswer, but oh well this is where I let my imagination tun wild. The only lament I have is that its over, now I must endure and re-read the books over and over again.  Oh well that what great series make you do.
B00005NIE1|1.0|I was pumped to receive this album on vinyl. When it came, a Kings of Leon vinyl was inside the Strokes case. I can't think of a worse band to be inside to surprise me. Either way, I got the wrong record, which sucks because is this it is amazing.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan dives deep into the imagination and the visceral senses, the ecstasy and depression, the psychology that every highly creative person lives with intensely throughout his or her lifetime.      It is universal.      Those who don't feel what is depicted have more than likely not pushed themselves into the realm of the highly creative nor intensely compelled, whether their work is acting, ballet, playwriting, writing librettos and lyrics for musical theatre, architecture, music composition, fine-art painting, even mathematics demanding insight and intuition.      To succeed in competition and in achieving excellence in an artistic endeavor requires surpassing all others around you, in duration and intensity of focus, in depth of introspection, reaching into the most subtle and abstract qualities of your art, as well as the most visceral, heightening perceptions and skills beyond those of others also striving for and achieving your high art.      This promises the artist unequaled ecstasy and also lays the trap of vulnerability to unimaginable depression, just as is shown in Black Swan. If you challenge this, read a bit of history of the Masters in art, music, dance and poetry.  The psychology of creativity - - manic depression and suicide line the road we travel.     In this sense knowledge is truly strength.       As practicing artists, the more we learn of this, the stronger and more capable we become to deal with it. Teachers in the creative arts need this knowledge as a resource, as do practicing psychologists.    My only criticism of the movie is of the last scene.  Would someone be able to perform the ballet scene so injured?  Or is that scene part of the delusion also?    The artists who created this movie though their sensitivity and courageousness have my profound thanks.    Black Swan is a masterwork though not every person may be prepared to see it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This novel was wonderful. It is book No. 1 out of the Jack Reacher series. It was very suspenceful and kept me guessing. It also taught me alot about fake money ~ if it's true or not I have no idea, but it was fasinating all the same. It got slow in some areas, but every novel has those and I think if those slow moments weren't put in, it would have almost made me dizzy with action. However, this was a fantastic novel and I can' t wait to read No. 2.
030746363X|5.0|I think this book is clever, enthusiastic and a fun read! Of course there are sections that will interest some more than others, but I find some of the information is just fascinating and I love that he self-experiments with some of them. I was interested in the slow-carb diet part, I had 10 pounds left from my pregnancy and could not get the scale to budge-I did follow it (okay 90%) in the first 2 weeks I lost 7 pounds and my clothes fit better (its not a fun diet, and I didnt have 50lbs to lose, but when you cannot get past those last 10, 7 pounds is an accomplishment) I also purchased the kettleball and followed the workout-I was impressed! I even recommended it to a few friends!  I know people are going to write negative reviews, critique it to death etc...but lighten up and just read it, and no matter who you are there is going to be some information that is a little appealing and you may even learn something new! (Im working on the running chapter now!) Some of the topics and experiments of course you would not include in daily life (ice baths? No thanks!) But I think whether you implement some of his suggestions, experiment yourself, debunk his theories or just want to be entertained there is a chapter or 2 worth reading in this. And best of all its presented in a way you can flip through the recommended chapters like a textbook. I really enjoyed this! Im a total Tim Ferris fan!
030746363X|4.0|The Four Hour Body should be an invaluable resource for the fitness-illiterate, and a helpful tool for those with a more advanced understanding of the human body to remind those of what it's like to not have that advanced understanding. For someone who is looking for a book on fat-loss, I highly recommend this book. However, the chapters on all other topics end with resources for further reading (mostly other books), leaving those topics incomplete. On all areas except for fat-loss, this book serves largely as only an introduction to the topic.<br />Overall I am very pleased with this book and it is worth the price. If someone you know is looking to lose weight or eat better, buy them a copy.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Loved this documentary movie which thoughtfully caught the experience of being befriended on the internet.  It is suspenseful, fascinating and tender.
030746363X|5.0|I've been reading the negative reviews, and I think the main problem is one of expectations.    What this book essentially is is a collection of non-mainstream (and yes some mainstream) ideas and methods with the overall purpose of getting readers to experiment with new (new to them at least) ways of reaching their body goals.    This is not a comprehensive guide to anything. It is a gateway to ideas and methods that may be new to you.    If you already know a lot about changing your body, you might be disappointed. You might already know about these things.    If you know mainly mainstream methods, there's tons of interesting, inspiring and useful stuff.    PS. Lost 5kg in the first 2 weeks and am enjoying myself.
B001BWQWKS|5.0|The works on this very full recording (80 minutes) have been part of my listening experience for many years.  This recording features the String Quartets of Debussy, Faure and Ravel played wonderfully by the Quatuor Ebene--a very young splendid French ensemble. Although I have heard these works many times before, I derived immense pleasure out of this recording by the Quatuor Ebene.  To me, in all three works they capture the \\"French essence\\" so very well; they sublimely capture what I call the \\"French Bouquet\\" by playing with the most beautiful tone and intonation.  To me, it's like eating a delicious Soufflé that melts into your mouth and evaporates into the \\"thin air\\". This Quartet is so very good, they give me great hope for the future of \\"Chamber Music\\".
0671027344|3.0|I had heard so much about this book from my friends and classmates that I expected it to be brilliant when I picked it up.  Honestly, I was disappointed. Charlie, the narrator, reminded me of an elementary school kid. I'm not sure what freshman is just \\"discovering\\" all the things he is, and the way he describes things sometimes is just so immature. If he hadn't stated his age I would have thought he was much younger. Of course he had his endearing moments, but I feel like the author tried to make him the anti-boy and instead just made him a little whiny kid. He never stopped crying and I admit that sometimes I would have punched him in the face if I could. He seems to be completely void of original thought about anything around him.   The rest of the characters are alright. I liked the characters of his mom and dad and the rest of his family. The rest of his friends seemed extremely two dimensional although they were entertaining at times. When charlie is left to his own vices it turns into an angst-fest fit for the lovers of The Catcher In The Rye.    Anyway, I would suggest that someone read it just because when someone asks you if you've read it you should be able to say you have. And a ton of my friends love it, so maybe you will too. But if you're looking for a realistic story with brilliant characters, don't expect to find much here.
0375850864|4.0|A crazy man on the street corner repeatedly chants \\"Bookbag, pocketshoe, bookbag, pocketshoe.\\" Miranda, the twelve-year-old narrator of When You Reach Me, the winner of the 2010 Newbery Medal, walks past this man every day. He is the laughing man. He's a fixture in her neighborhood. While he certainly weirds her out, she doesn't really have a problem with him. \\"It's crazy the things a person can pretend not to notice,\\" Miranda observes.<br /><br />Miranda notices a lot, often making wry observations about everyday occurrences in her seemingly mundane world. She frets about what her and her mom's apartment must look the first night she brings a new friend over. Who hasn't brought someone over to their place-a new friend, a date-and thought, \\"Holy crap! They can't see my place like this!\\" and immediately zeroed in on all the microscopic flaws of their house or apartment. Even though any good friend or good date isn't going to notice or care.<br /><br />Miranda takes a lot in stride. She has a cool head on her shoulders. Even when strange, supernatural things start to happen, like receiving letters from the future, she accepts them. They're normal to her in a world where her mother, a single parent, wears orange sweaters, denim skirts, and purple-and-black striped tights to work and steals pens and paper from the office. They're normal in a world where one kid punches another for seemingly no reason. They're normal in the late-seventies world where Miranda, at twelve, has a part-time job making sandwiches in a local deli. Her salary: a sandwich and a soda. What is normal after all?<br /><br />The book is structured around the $20,000 Pyramid, iconic late-seventies early-eighties game show hosted by Dick Clark. Appropriate, given that the Egyptian pyramids are often rumored to be linked to time-travel in some sort of way. Soon after her mother gets a postcard saying she'll be on the Pyramid, Miranda receives a mysterious note from the future. The mystery unfolds at a brisk pace. The notes Miranda receives are eerie and unsettling, but they never seem to phase her. She's a latchkey kid-a Schusselkinder in German, her mom's boyfriend tells her; she's used to thinking for herself.<br /><br />When You Reach Me captured my imagination in ways that most adult books do not. I was excited to tuck my tessellated-bird Escher bookmark between its pages, and almost sad when the book ended. Miranda's journey is both small and personal, and large enough to span forwards and backwards through time. I recommend this book for all ages, especially fans of time travel, or Madeline L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, Miranda's favorite book.nda receives are eerie and unsettling, but they never seem to phase her.

His 80 year old mother climbs into his bedroom and rocks her 40 year old son to sleep was...well...disturbing. I'm in the minority on this one, however.

B003EYVXTG|1.0|A TV movie. \\"You'd better find your Daddy, or you're going to lose the farm.\\"    Later: \\"You'd better PROVE your Daddy is dead, or you're going to lose the farm.\\"    The only thing missing here is Bruce McGill as the bad DA, Billy Bob Thornton as the good hillbilly, and perhaps Scott Glenn as a good/bad patriarch.    The only surprise in the movie is that the father actually is dead. Right up to the end I expected him to make an appearance.    Predictable, boring, stereotyped. As the movie goes on the dialogue becomes longer and more laborious, a sure sign that the director and screenwriter were out of their depth.    The female lead does have a certain Renée Zellwegger quality. If that allows you to watch it to the end, more power to you.    Not for serious movie lovers. See it at the drive-in.
B0000YEE7Q|4.0|George C. Scott is best known for his role as Patton, in the film of the same name. His brash, stern, controlling figure in that film is a man of honor who tumbles through his own failings. In that, he is like Mr. Rochester, the enigmatic anti-hero of Charlotte Bronte's Gothic novel, Jane Eyre. Whether you love or despise Mr. Rochester, he is a compelling literary figure without whom Jane Eyre would have floundered in literary history's dust bin. In this 1971 film version of the story, Scott does justice to this character much better than one might expect. See this film for his Rochester, rather than York's Jane. York is much too old for the role and not nearly as feisty as the novel's heroine. Scott, on the other hand, has the Rochester smolder down pat.
030746363X|5.0|If you are able to use even one of the many protocols Tim presents in this book it's worth picking up. However, do take the advice he gives in the opening chapter titled \\"Thinner, Bigger, Faster Stronger? How to Use This Book\\". Don't read it from cover to cover. You'll definitely want to pick a goal set (also conveniently organized in the opening chapter on page eleven) and get started. While some of his more mad scientist type experiments are truly out there or most of us mere mortals, the bulk of his approach is brilliantly simple.
030746363X|5.0|The book is amazing. I have started with just making the changes to my diet and I feel terrific. On my free day I can't wait to get back to eating the 'diet food'! I have nad no trouble at all sticking to the the diet. Now I'm ready to start adding more changes- exercise, ice baths, etc. I will measure after one more week- but my clothes are already very loose after 3 weeks. Why didn't I do this earlier!!!!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|The AKG k702s are by far the best sounding headphones I have ever owned. Amazon has a great price for them considering that the suggested retail is $540.     If you are an audiophile looking for open cans that play music exactly as it was recorded, look no further!    I have never heard headphones in this price range that can rival stereo systems over two times their price, but the AKG k702s deliver!     Monitering headphones are designed to produce an accurate open air sound. Don't purchase these headphones if you are looking for overpowering bass, open cans are designed to eliminate that obnoxious \\"trapped in your head\\" sound that you get with closed cans. (Bassheads will be disappointed), but if you want to listen to intricate pieces of music, these headphones present a beautiful full and articulated sound.      Naturally, there is significant noise leakage (again because they are open cans. So if you plan on using headphones on a plane or in public, just know that sound can escape, and in louder environments sound gets in.    These were not designed to cancel outside noise, since that particular technology greatly degrades the quality of the music.    As for the comfort of the 702s, they are so well designed that you can easily forget they are on your head! They are very lightweight, and feel very well- made. Additionally, they are designed to automatically adjust to the head they are placed on, so dont worry about them not fitting you! I have shared them with probably over 30 different people at this point, and they fit them all perfectly!    -2 minor cons for my use personally:    1-The detachable cable is 10 feet long, which can be cumbersome if you are walking around a lot. I recommend carefully wrapping the cord in the middle to the right legnth for your use, and using a rubber band or something to keep it together...DO NOT wrap or coil the cord for storage of these or any set of headphones! That can loosen and eventually disconnect the wires.    2-They arefairly big (because they are designed to sit away from and around your ears, which partially provides the amazing sound they produce) so the size and shape combined make them cumbersome to travel with.. they take up a significant amount of space, and are akward to keep around your neck.  ********************************************************************************************************************  Overall, they are a wonderful pair of headphones. I would highly recommend them to anyone with love for studio- quality music..    PS..they work great with my iPod, as well as my friend's Zune..Although a portable amplifier might be a good investment to experience the 702's full potential.    --->If you want to do some of your own research, I found that [...] is an amazing comprehensive jumping- off point for finding the right headphones for your intended use.
B000LPS3B2|3.0|This is the first time i watch an Asian horror and didn't like it.  I thought this movie was extremely boring, i was really disappointed.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|First and foremost, do NOT pay any attention to the 1 star reviews that are complaining that they couldn't take the time to check the difference between the reg. edition and the special edition so they were upset that the basic version was in Dolby sound and not HD. They aren't rating the movie at all. They are only rating it 1 star based off their own frustrations.<br />On to the movie:<br />Extras:<br />This is a fun to watch, a bit over the top but fun to watch film. In the behind the scenes they talk about how everyone brought their A-game and it made the others step up and be competative which made for a fun movie to make. You can see the sincerity in their interviews that even the top stars were enjoying working with the other stars in the film. At first, you may say, \\"There are very few special features. Why is this a special edition?\\" Well, the special edition has better audio/sound and I guess that's it but in the extras menu, it has only 3-4 extras but once you go into these options, it opens up many more short behind the scenes, interviews and much more. It looks like very little extras but there's more there than it looks like.<br />Movie:<br />By \\"over the top\\" I meant that anyone with any military or spec ops experience will say, \\"Um...you can't do that\\" at a few points but it's a movie and don't look too much into the somewhat exhagerated parts and you'll really enjoy this movie. One example is, you can NOT continually fire a 50cal machinegun without letting go of the trigger. You have to fire in 3-4 round bursts or you'll melt the barrel and it will seize up or worse. Small stuff like this might annoy some people but just watch it and enjoy.<br />There are a lot of great one-liners and Malkovich (Martin) gets some of the best lines. Although Bruce Willis (ex-CIA) can be called the star, Morgan Freeman (ex-CIA), John Malkovich (ex-CIA), Helen Mirren (ex-MI6), Brian Cox (ex-KGB?), Karl Urban (CIA) and many more are all written so well that they all steal scenes at one point or another.<br />Karl Urban is the younger CIA agent that is on the trail of the retired (RED) operatives and as the movie progresses, I found it very well written that even though he is slowly learning that maybe these guys aren't the bad guys, he does his job no matter what. He still chases them, looks deeper and deeper into the situation until he finally finds out the truth.or another.

B002IVLH60|4.0|reading for reviews for Pearl Jams recent albums you will likely see many many 5star reviews and a good bit of 1 or 2 star reviews from stupid fans who think Pearl Jam's only great album was \\"Ten\\"...ive been a Pearl Jam fan since the 90s and let me tell you, this album ROCKS!...if you have followed Pearl Jam over the years you will love the album...most of the songs are catchy and fast..the cd is worth purchasing for the song \\"unthought known\\" alone..ive let many friends hear it and they all agree that it's PJ's best song since the 90s....other standouts include the singles \\"amongst the waves\\", the gorgeous \\"just breathe\\"...a great track to hear live called \\"got some\\" and a great opener in \\"gonna see my friend\\"...sure there are a few songs on this cd you will probably skip..and its probably not as GREAT an album as their last cd , the self titled avacodo album, but this is really Pearl Jam letting loose and having some fun and it shows....if you're expecting another \\"Ten\\" then dont waste your time..but who wants another \\"ten\\"..that wasnt even pearl jam's best album...any true PJ fan will tell you that \\"Vitalogy\\" or \\"Yield\\" are the best PJ albums.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a really good workout video.  If you are pressed for time and want a good work out, get this DVD you will not be disappointed.
1933308087|5.0|The most amazing quilting book I've ever seen.  I've been quilting for 20 years, and this book is just stunning ... thousands of color illustrations of quilt block patterns, with historical information and research sprinkled throughout.  This might not be helpful for a beginning quilter, who needs \\"how to\\" instructions, but for intermediate and experienced quilters who are looking for inspiration and can figure out themselves how to put blocks together, this is highly recommended.
B0043RSE2M|4.0|I saw this, in 3D, at the theater and enjoyed it.  I bought the four pack which includes the 3D version to \\"future proof\\" myself as for when the prices come down on 3D entertainment.  The movie itself was slow, but had some very good parts in it.  I did enjoy the crew of mischievous minions, and the extras that were with the movie.  Can anyone say sequel?
B000W91RUG|5.0|My friend got me hooked on this show and there are few shows that compare to the hilarity and truth of this storyline! A brilliant idea created by brilliant writers. I highly recommend watching the seasons!
0930073193|5.0|No matter what bone-headed decision a politician announces these days, I find that Mr. Hazlitt anticipated it in this book in the 1940s - and describes it with a great deal more clarity. A very worthwhile antidote to anyone who insists that \\"this time, it's going to work\\".
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|After blitz watching the first 4 series, and all but the last \\"lost year\\" specials on netflix, I was saddened to see I couldn't stream the last special (end of time) on the 'flix. So I went looking for a hardcopy of it, and was torn between getting this \\"Complete Specials\\" on bluray, or just the standalone discs for End Of Time (on dvd).<br /><br />Decided to get this instead. I must say, getting to rewatch the other specials in 1080 bluray was worth the difference in cost (compared to netflix), even ontop of getting to see what I consider one of David Tennant's finest (and sadly last :() performances in spectacular detail.<br /><br />The extras for the specials, plus some \\"last days\\" vidoc diaries by Tennant are a real treat for any Doctor Who fan (something that is lost on streaming services)
0385341679|2.0|I wondered how the author was going to pull this off. It was a very ambitious project,and she didn't exactly fail, but I am glad I pre-ordered this and didn't pay full price.<br /><br />The problem, in my opinion, is that she used this book to do two things- tie up loose strings ,providing anti-climatic explanations- and set up a back story for her new series.<br /><br />I would have preferred that some of the strings had been left dangling and that rather than attempt to suprise readers with the \\"unexpected\\" all the time, she had let her characters maintain some integrity (must everything be something other than what it seems? and trust me - thinking of the possibilities (why is Barron's such an a--, what is she really? )is much better than knowing when it comes to this story- he is an a-- because his son has been traumatized and reduced to an animal state forever and she is a person with a book imprinted in her brain).<br /><br />It also would have been nice if her characters had shown some development other than just talking about how they had changed (the main character has delusions that she is tough, smart,capable, and a match for all the players on the chess board, to bad all we ever see is her being moved around like a pawn). I guess that is the crux of it, five books into the series and the main character is just as clueless as ever, and knowing the answers to \\"all my questions\\" makes me wonder why I ever cared - glad this series is over.
030745455X|3.0|I read The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and found it to be a fairly fun book to read, albeit not nearly as engaging as the jacket suggests (but what book is?).  This sequel covers the continued exploits of the world's toughest waif; but does it in a way where I was unable to suspend my disbelief.  The first half drags along, setting up way too many characters, especially considering how irrelevant some of them turn out to be.  The second half becomes increasingly implausible, to the point I actually laughed a few times; and it wasn't supposed to be funny. Lisbeth easily handles thugs twice her size, fears no one, and always takes out time to have a sandwich and coffee.  I digress, but what is it with sandwiches and coffee?  Must be a Swedish thing, because every ten pages or so, someone else is having sandwiches and coffee.  Or just coffee.  Lots of coffee.  Seattle apparently has nothing on Sweden when it comes to drinking coffee....<br /><br />I also felt like Larsson used Lisbeth Salander's computer expertise as a cop-out to get past any potentially tricky plot issues.  How does she snag a car in a parking garage full of security cameras?  Simple: she hacks into the security company (with her Mac, of course) and quickly moves where the camera points.  And she does it with just a few keystrokes.  It's so silly it made me wonder if Larson had any idea how computers really work. And while she is exceedingly brilliant in the ways of security and computers, she falls into a trap so simple late in the book that it left me scratching my head wondering if I'm reading about the same character.<br /><br />There must have been a product placement deal with IKEA too, as the furniture is mentioned at least a dozen times, mostly in the context of a laborious tour of Salanders new apartment; even though she spends no time there.<br /><br />Anyway, lots of hype surround these books, but the first two were pretty average.  I'm not reading the final one, because if this book is any indication, I'm sure Lisbeth will survive an attack by an army of men with AK-47's....and have a sandwich and coffee to boot.th will survive an attack by an army of men with AK-47's....and have a sandwich and coffee to boot.
B002MJV75O|5.0|I rated this 5 stars because the show is so great that I think it is worth buying, either as a complete set or individual seasons. I have all the seasons in the original release boxes but as I have watched these dvds over and over they are starting to show wear and I would like to replace my entire collection. I have held off because I am hoping these will either come out on Blu Ray or with a digital copy option for my ipod, as I would love to have my Dawson's creek with me wherever I go. If you loved the show like I did, you will not be disappointed with buying them on dvd to enjoy over and over.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|In 2003 mountain-climber Aron Ralston went on a hiking trip in a desolate part of Utah without telling anyone where he was going. He became trapped at the bottom of a canyon when a boulder dislodged and pinned his right arm to a wall. Over the course of five days with little water, less food, and no hope of being found, Aron made a video diary documenting his ordeal while trying to sustain by any means necessary (including drinking his own urine). Eventually, in a moment of desperation, Aron was forced to amputate his arm with a dull knife in order to escape. Ralston is obviously a brave human being, who was faced with a dilemma in which many people would've chosen death. His act is a triumph of human determination and willpower and his story is brought to life by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle. 127 Hours is widely considered one of the best films of 2010 and recently received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. While complaints have been aimed at Aron's character (some people see his decision to not tell anyone where he was going \\"stupid), the use of dream sequences/surreal imagery, and Boyle's hyperkinetic style; I found no issue with these aspects of the film. In fact, I've been so impressed by this film the two times I've seen it I can hardly find a negative thing to say about it.    Boyle and his co-writer Simon Beaufoy (the Oscar-winning scribe behind Boyle's previous film Slumdog Millionaire) stay faithful to Aron's ordeal and over the course of a riveting 90 minutes, Boyle shows us how powerful the will to survive can be. The success of the film hinges on the dynamite portrayal of Aron by James Franco. The film spends the first 15 minutes establishing Aron's thrill-seeking personality; his drive to Blue John Canyon in Utah, his encounter with two girls (Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara), and eventually the moment where he found himself in an unimaginable situation. From here, it's a one-man show for Franco. Aron has a watch, a video camera, a CD player, headphones, a flashlight, a rope and pulley, but almost no food and little water. Franco leads us through Aron's initial attempts to escape, his quiet acceptance of his fate, and his refusal to simply wait for death. Knowing the ending doesn't make the film any less suspenseful and the proceedings are nothing short of riveting.    Boyle tells this story in just 90 minutes, a perfect running-time that neither drags it out nor rushes it. In the hands of another director this could have been a snooze-fest, but Boyle has crafted a film that creates tension by perfectly capturing the claustrophobia of Aron's ordeal. While dream sequences/hallucinations are used, they don't clutter the story needlessly. They are necessary to establish Aron's personality and further the themes that Boyle and Beaufoy are trying to convey with their interpretation of Aron's story. It's not these images or his visual pizzazz that Boyle uses to carry the story, but his willingness to stay with Aron and allow James Franco to lead the audience through the story with his show-stopping performance.    The success of the film rests on Franco's shoulder and I couldn't spot the slightest misstep in his performance. Franco has to be interesting enough to hold your attention for over an hour, as well as making his character's journey believable. Through body language and tone of voice, Franco makes you believe you're watching an optimistic man slowly relinquish all hope before making one final decision in an attempt to save his own life. This is not a typical Oscar-bait performance, but a nuanced performance built on much subtlety. Spending the bulk of the film in a small space without the use of his right arm, Franco brings the audience right into that canyon with him. When the climactic scene arrives, you believe that Aron has reached this point of desperation. Had Franco made the smallest mistake in his performance, it could've brought the whole film down. I believe James Franco would win theAcademy Award if not for Colin Firth as he delivers one of the most riveting and truly impressive screen performances of 2010.    One can't discuss this film without mentioning the climax, where Aron must finally take his fate into his own hands and amputate his arm. The scene is both realistic and horrifying, even more when one takes into account that this actually occurred. Rarely does a scene make me wince and recoil the way this scene did. It's brilliantly shot, acted, edited, and executed; graphic, but Boyle only shows as much as necessary relying on haunting sound effects and Franco to convey what's happening. It's a powerful, unforgettable scene.    127 Hours is an unforgettable experience that works on so many different levels. It's entertaining, exciting, intense, brilliant, and ultimately moving; a triumphant piece of filmmaking. It's much better than Boyle's Best Picture-winning Slumdog Millionaire (a film which has been widely forgotten) and is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2010. Having seen it twice now, it's still as suspenseful and powerful as it was the first time I watched it. While subsequent viewings and time may show some imperfections, it will remain the most intense movie-going experience I had in 2010.    GRADE: A
030746363X|5.0|Well being that I have studied, worked, lived, and breathed the exercise and diet world for years now, you are probably not shocked to hear that when a friend began to tell me about this book I was initially quite skeptical. But I'm not too proud to say that I was eating my words a few short days later. Tim describes in a simple but addicting way (I could not put the book down) the process that he went through to come up with the crazy conclusions that the book lays out. I was sucked in as soon as I saw his scientific data and how honestly it made sense and is in line with what I've questioned for some time. It's definitely worth the read even for the skeptics. Prepare to be humbled and then to have your life turned upside down...for the better. Thank you Tim for the commitment you have to research and sharing your knowledge with the rest of us.
B000000WCA|5.0|I have owned this album since I was a 5 year old girl. You might say this review is mostly out of nostalgia. I have to confess though. Well...I'm 19 now and still love every song on this albumXD YES! I said it! I still love this album and the Spice Girls. When I was younger the Spice Girls were the thing man. Today they have Hannah Montana, Bieber fever, Jonas Brothers, and other mainstream artist, but in the 90's one group (besides the Backstreet Boys) had girls everywhere blasting their boom boxes and that was the Spice Girls.      Let me just say that their songs are the very definition of earworms. Once you here \\"Wannabe\\" it will never leave your head! I haven't listened to the song in years, but still know every single word of that song. This song if you ask me is their trademark song. If I remember correctly its their very first song (correct me if I'm wrong) and is one of them songs that will send even people that hated the Spice Girls into a fit of 90's nostalgia.       Then there's \\"Say You'll Be There\\". This is another ear worm of a song that you'll find yourselves unexpectingly singing to yourself. I remember it was one of my favorite songs too. Now that I'm older this song doesn't really sound as good to me as it did when I was little, but I still love singing along to it.       Now one of my favorites songs; 2 become 1. OMG I still love this song. Anyone who listens to this song will tell you that the heart of this song is the vocals of Baby Spice, AKA, Emma Bunton. She is hands down the best singer of all the girls, and is able to hit a high note like its nothing. The same can be said about the second to last song \\"Naked\\". All she does throughout the entire song is shout \\"NAKED\\"!! Yet it sounds awesome. That leads me to something else. \\"Love thing\\", \\"Last Time Lover\\", and \\"Naked\\" itself were songs which meanings went way over my head when I was little. The fact that the Spice Girls actually did a concert movie where they sang the song \\"Naked\\" literallynaked didn't send any \\"this is awkward\\" grown up thoughts through my mind. Sigh...how innocent and naive I wasXD \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\" is another song that will dig through you ears and never leave once you hear it. I think out of all their songs it rivals Wannabe when it comes to catchiness. When I was little I always thought \\"If U Can't Dance\\" was sampling Montell Williams \\"This Is How We Do It\\". Then I discovered Digital Undergrounds \\"Humpty Hump\\" (fricking love this song) when I was 13, which I think the Spice Girls originally sampled thier beat from now.     I can't forget \\"Mama\\". Oh man I really can't forget \\"Mama\\".  The song is basically them telling their moms how much they love them. I don't want to sound like a wimp, but when I was little this song made me cry. It made me think of my own mom and how much I love her. If anything were to happen to her I don't know what I would do.     The Spice Girls are a huge part of the 90's pop culture. Their music was great, fun, and addictive. Writing this review has really brought me down memory lane. If you'll excuse me I'm going to go listen to \\"Too Much\\". Bye-Bye and enjoy this album with your kids.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This album is really the best I've heard in a long time. I mean I fully enjoyed each and every song on this CD. It is incredible. I'm actually considering buying the digital copy as well because it is that good!! R&B, pop, reggae, doo wop I mean wow I'm in heaven from beginning to the end!!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|First thing is I got this version of the film since I upgraded to HD and Blu Ray and this was a great deal as I got it half off. Love Amazon deals. This is a great movie that was snubbed for picture of the year oscar. You will get caught up in this world once you start watching it! It's a must own for Blu Ray owners and fans of the film or for people who haven't seen it yet. Fully recommend the film and this edition of the Blu Ray.
0439023513|2.0|While the first two books were AMAZING and I wished they would have never ended..  the last book was disappointing. I wanted to be finished as quick as possible with it and even considered quit reading it because it was completely different than the other books.  Brutal and violent in a way I didn't recognize from the other books and Katniss herself was just annoying.   She was a cool character in the other books but eventually everything you saw from her was her being mentally disordered and other people keeping her alive.   Totally disappointing. I would just stop with the second book.
030746363X|5.0|Really enjoyed the book and tim's writing style.  Very personable.  It turns a lot of traditional science and weight loss concepts on their heads.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Given all that has been written on this series, I can't find much more to add.  But let me simply say this, I am a history wonk, I also love the documentary format.  This particular documentary (or set of documentaries, if you prefer) was created when I was merely in diapers but greatness endures.  This is the greatest documentary ever filmed.  Period.  I am particularly fascinated by the Stalingrad episode and the other episodes focusing on the Eastern front, as that was the focal point of the war.  But, in any event, this documentary encapsulates in perfect form one of the most profound eras in the history of man.    Don't miss it.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I think the series was excellent... well produced, great story, even better plots and sub-plots, and lots of intrigue.  If you view it you will see it is   historically accurate with great cinematography , sound  and costumes. It shows very clearly that humans have not changed one bit in over 2000 years.  Not for the squeamish , has lots of sexual content, bloody violence, and XXX language. You must understand though , that this was Rome, the period in time  and that life had very little meaning . You had a problem you needed to resolve? Violence. You wished to pacify the masses ? Violence. You had a political  agenda to promote....promote it through violence. An excellent portrayal of the early human condition.
0765326353|5.0|It's long, as plenty of reviews have said, but that doesn't take away from it. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. If you liked Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, you'll probably enjoy this.<br /><br />The artwork is great, the way the story builds up is also great. My Aunt and I both enjoyed it.
B003ASLJPY|5.0|Although I have not viewed this video as of today, I did see it as a motion picture in the theater and loved it. The reason I wanted to add it to my collection.  It is more of an anti-war film from the Japanese viewpoint, similar to the story as presented in the book/film \\"All Quiet On The Western Front\\"  by Remarque.  In this film the youth of Japan march off to be victimized by a failed military doctrine just as the German youth in Remarque's famed tale.
030726999X|5.0|The book arrived crispy new, well packaged, and on the earliest date promised.  Convenient and time saving shopping with Amazon has become the #1 retail choice for books in our household, we all have an account.  The savings on university textbooks (new or used) is often substantial.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|...but I do look forward to having Star Wars in a HD format. Personally, I would've rather just bought the original trilogy, but I have a feeling Lucas is going to sucker punch us with the extras only being available on the entire box set. I won't be surprised if this happens. The deleted scenes from the original trilogy would be worth it alone. Am I happy about buying it in Blu-Ray 7 years after it came out on DVD? No, but I like high definition.<br /><br />I've been into the Star Wars movies since I was 2, when the original STAR WARS came out, so I can also say I'm a diehard fan. That being said, to those fanboys who keep complaining about the 'original theatrical\\" release of the original trilogy, IT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN! Lucas has already said that he destroyed the original prints and the versions that came out a few years ago were from the Laserdisc version. He is not going to go back and remaster a print that doesn't even exist anymore, so get over it. As much as I wish Lucas would stop peddling different versions of the movies, they are his movies to do with as he pleases, whether we like it or not. No one cares if \\"Lucas raped your childhood\\" (if you want to sound like a pathetic whiny fanboy, keep saying that). We are getting deleted scenes and other miscellany this time that we've never gotten before. If you want to call foul on it, don't buy it. That is the power of the dollar in a capitalistic society. As for me, I'll be forking out the $90 for it.
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|Like many of the previous reviewers, I read the first two books in the series, silly as they were.  But, I just could not get through the third one.  After slogging about 1/3 of the way through I just flipped to the last chapter. I'm sorry I wasted my time.  At least I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste any money!
B00447G2T8|5.0|This is in my opinion, Helloween's best album to date. If you are a Helloween fan then the 7 sinners album is a must have. Every song on this album is very awesome and well worth the money. The album is another Helloween masterpiece.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|For people who like to learn about animals and our environment this is a great movie. I thought I would like some of the episodes like birds, but not like the ones about insects. The insects episode is just as interesting as the birds. The HD quality is great and don't forget to stay tuned after the episode to see the making of features. The ones about the butterflies in Mexico and the bower birds are amazing to see how much work it takes to get this footage.
0061537969|5.0|I bought the audio edition and am listening to it for the second time.  I really like this book and would recommend it without reservation.  Have a tissue handy.
B0045D3N3O|5.0|I had this movie on DVD.  I was looking forward to upgrading to Blu-Ray/but I'll just have to wait.  Thanks to the greedy artists who control the music rights.  Hopefully the Blu-Ray won't be delayed too long.  This truely is one of Spike Lee's best films ever.  Really disapointed about the Blu-Ray cancilation of this film.!!!
B000065AI3|5.0|This is Tom Petty and the HeartBreakers First, Best and Most underappreciated Album. It gave two classic time tested songs like Breakdown and American Girl that everybody remembers and loves. But every other song on the album is as good as those yet never appears on any Greatest Hits or Anthology collections.
1594202842|4.0|I recently read this book after seeing an article in People magazine.  The book was enjoyable, and sometimes I chuckled at what I thought was absurd.  I would never consider treating my children the way the Amy Chua sometimes treated hers.  At no time did I feel that Amy Chua was telling the readers that this is the way everyone should raise their children.  She was telling her story about how she and her husband are raising their children.  Amy Chua also criticized herself and learned, somewhat, from her families reaction to her parenting style.    I believe some of the criticism is unwarranted.  Some \\"western\\" families send their kids to boarding school or sleep away camp for weeks on end, or hire nannies.   Is that right or wrong?  It is neither; it depends on the families, and their familial values and circumstances.    I, myself, have been criticized many times for simply not allowing my children to eat in the grocery store while I was shopping.  I had a hard and fast rule that you d0 not eat food until it was paid for.  Every family has rules.  Some you agree with and some you don't.  If you don't like what Amy Chua is doing, then don't do it yourself.      .
B0028IDXDS|4.0|I really love this product. It does a pretty good job of keeping the pacifier in my 4wk old sons mouth. When I first gave it to him he grabbed onto the plush little monkey and held it tight. It stays in his mouth as long as he doesn't move around too much. I think that has to do with the fact that my son tends to suck and stop and suck again. If you have a strong sucker I don't think this would happen.     I gave this a 4 star rather than a 5 because not long after we got it (about a week) part of the stitching on the pacifier came undone. It still works, and the pacifier is still very secure, I just can see it possibly falling off in a few months or so...especially because it is all he wants to use. I do think it could have to do with the way we have used it (I place it in his mouth when I am cradling him close to my chest to calm him down, which causes the pacifier to kinda pull to the side...the same side that the stitching came undone on). All the same it is a great product and I plan on buying more in the future.    FYI- I purchased this product on Amazon from one of their private sellers. I got free shipping however spent 19.99 for this Monkey one because it said it was the last one and other sites had it on back order. I wanted the monkey so I spent the extra money (Most others are only $12-14), only to log back on a few days later and see amazon selling it for cheaper with free super saver shipping and the same seller still saying they only had one left. In fact I think it still says that lol. Just be careful when not buying direct from amazon.    All in all I am not upset for spending a a few bucks more than normal...even at that price it has been totally worth it and a life saver for any mom with a fussy baby!
B004EVRM7K|1.0|Exclusive Panasonic... BS. I am not about to purchase a Panasonic 3d TV just to get this, especially since I already have a 3D set-up including a 3D TV and a 3D Blu-Ray DVD player and the glasses you are delusional!
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I LOVE Josh Groban.  He has been my favorite vocalist for years. Every other CD has at least one song that brings me to tears when I listen, just because of the sheer beauty of his voice.  At any rate, I just ordered \\"Illuminations\\" without previewing it.  MISTAKE.  There has never been a Josh CD I didn't like, but this one comes close.  He hits a LOT of high notes, almost falsetto, and his power doesn't come through on the high notes. The songs don't do his voice justice at all.  I know he likes to make a statement, but these songs don't have a lot of long notes so that you can hear the vibrato in his voice.  I think he has the most powerful and beautiful voice in the world-but \\"Illuminations\\" does NOT \\"illuminate\\"  me.  In the future I will preview songs before buying.  But buy ALL of his other CDs and DVDs-they're wonderful.    Sorry Josh!
030746363X|4.0|I enjoyed this read and there were quite a few interesting tips that have worked for me and others I have yet to test.  I think if you are looking for an exact how-to book, this is not for you.  If you are looking for some funny anecdotes, some starting points, and an inspiration for responsible and thorough self-experimentation and research, then this is a good book for you.  Everything is not there for you, so you have to do some work yourself, which sometimes is frustrating but is also a blessing.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|I recently purchased this in Sydney, and though I can't confirm what you'll receive from Amazon, I can confirm from other reviews that the latest versions of this Griffin product come with plastic clips on the end which precent the laptop from ever sliding off the stand.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with the quality of this product. The two aluminium struts feel substantial and have a decent, have generous rubber pads for feet, and I'm seeing some decent operating temperature improvements on my 2010 i7 15\\" Macbook Pro - probably a drop somewhere around 5 degrees Celsius for the toasty CPU temperatures. There's only the slightest wobble when the Macbook is touched (as can be expected), but as a stand to keep the Macbook alongside an external monitor it's great. It raises the laptop to eye-level, and leaves a little space underneath to maybe put an external hard drive, router, or whatever else you might fancy with your newfound desk space. All for a decent price.<br /><br />I'm not giving this product five stars, only because I'm not so keen on the look of the plastic base unit, and I wish the plastic clips had been integrated into the original design so that the aluminium simply curved upwards. While it's fantastic that the whole unit is detachable and therefore easily portable, I just find the clear acrylic looks a bit tacky. From a functional standpoint, I'm pleased.
B00005JKNF|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite movie, loved watching & getting lost in all the machinations of the different classes, the wardrobe is killer & some of the all time greats are ALL together, viewer will not get tired of any scene or storyline. seller stacie19 was very helpful, prompt and obliging. would buy from her again.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The sharpener is great to keep in your pickup/car. No matter if your fishing, hunting or just out in the woods and need to sharpen a knife or axe this little baby does the job fast and easy. With in a few minutes I sharpened up two knives I had setting on my desk. one of which was my leather man that was about as sharp as a butter knife, not any more nice and sharp.  Great thing is the sharpener is small and lite so you can even keep it in your pocket.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I enjoy all of Bruce Willis's Die Hard movies and this is no exception.  He's got that kind of action intrigue that makes his movies enjoyable to watch.  There isn't a lot of swearing in this movie like the others, but when he swears, it's kind of funny.  I'm going to purchase \\"Red\\" now and put that one in my Bruce Willis Collection also.  Bob
030746363X|5.0|Loved his last book and love this one. As Tim says early in the book, don't let skepticism be a excuse for inaction. I have personally seen huge results through the parts of the book I've applied and recommend it to anyone and everyone looking to make some changes.
B0043XQ1TE|5.0|Where do I begin.  First, I have never written a review on amazon.com for anything, let alone music.  However, I can't resist praising this amazing record: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  The poetry is incredible, the religious references hard to miss, the layering of all of the instruments so rich and incredible, it's not overproduced and the execution is flawless.      These guys are great live, and their first record is also a must have, but I think Halcyon Digest is amazing. I hope Deerhunter is around forever.  Thank you for enriching my music collection.
B0043RGY60|5.0|This is War is definitely one of the most epic album I've owned . What I love about what this band had done with this album is the incorporation of their fans. Not only are we going to be singing along at the shows, but we are going to be a part of the show. 30 Seconds to Mars is the fans. Every song, from the drums to the voices, is haunting and memorable. Compared to the last album it is only a step towards the right path. It is powerful, emotional and physically intense all in 12 tracks.
0786715103|5.0|I love this book.  It's brutally honest and forthcoming about the genocide in Rwanda in '94, the events leading up to it and the fallout afterwards.  Mr. Dallaire is a very brave and humble writer and I can't tell you how much I appreciate his insights. This books is a gem and should be read by anyone interested in history, international relations, government and politics.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|We own the first three Seasons and cannot get enough of it.  Thanks to Amazon for helping us get Season 3 for under $15.00!  Everyone we showed the series to loved it!  You have to watch this series from the beginning because the story builds upon itself and the characters develop from episode to episode.  As my husband says, \\"I laughed at least once every episode!\\".
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was so disturbing, I couldn't seem to put it down!  The characters are so thoughtfully written, that even though it is a story about a sick, twisted, murderous government, I read through it rather quickly and started immediately on the second installment of the series.
030746363X|5.0|this book is great, was a gift from a friend. the first week I had it I couldn't put it down. all the advice is really practical and straight-forward. you can use what interests you and go back for more later. Tim has a really engaging and humorous writing style that is enjoyable to read. I'm currently doing the slow-carb diet and feeling great, I'm also working on effortless superhuman. good luck to all the self-experimenters out there!
030746363X|5.0|A simple road map to get the fastest results in minimal time. Tim did the research, now just follow the directions. I have weight trained in the style suggested and it does work. It is not easy, but the time spent training is very brief, it must be brief or risk over training/over dose. Train 2-3 times a week at a much higher intensity and let your body rest and recover. We are a society of more is better, more is not better. Just like medicine, take the proper dose and take it at the proper interval.
1439102813|5.0|As a 52 year old, this book is frightening.  The main character, Alice, a Harvard Projessor, at age 50 begins forgetting words.  Little things start slipping her mind.  She chalks this up to menopause and stress.  But one day, while out running, she becomes disoriented only blocks from her home and can't remember how to get home.<br /><br />She is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers.  Then, through her voice, we watch her rapid, tragic decline.  Her voice, her thoughts, as they change.  Her knowledge of what is happening to her.<br /><br />I found this book very believable, though I don't have any real life instances to compare it to.  The characters of her family all seemed like real people.  The husband, denying and a little selfish.  The daughters, helpful and worried.  Distinguished colleagues, uncomfortable.<br /><br />The downside of reading this book, is I now am keenly aware of everything I forget, my misplaced keys, the person's name I can't remember.
030746363X|4.0|The book is not the end all be all of nutrition and fitness, but it does give the majority of readers a starting point and guide for further inquiry. Tim puts a lot of information out there in this book just like in the 4HWW. It's what you do with the information that applies to you that can make a difference. Tim's books, as with other good books, give me new ideas and areas to explore and research. There is no one book or author that can deliver on all the world's promises but what I like about this book and the 4HWW is that it offers insights into topics for further study.
B0000263YY|5.0|I don't typically write too many music reviews but I just had to leave one for one of my favorite soundtracks of all time.  Xanadu, the movie, was a very magical experience when I saw it as a child.  The music from the movie always brought back fond emotions of that time in my life.  Several years ago, I decided I wanted to add the soundtrack to my music collection but could not find a domestic copy on CD anywhere.<br /><br />What I found out was that the Xanadu soundtrack had not been released domestically on compact disc.  So, I overpaid and purchased an Australian import version of it.  I enjoyed the music immensely but the sound quality was rather poor.  Still, I was delighted to finally have access to some of my most wonderful childhood memories.  It appears that in 1998, a few years after I obtained the import, Xanadu was finally released domestically in the US.  Sony Music UK released a version too, but gave it an amazing makeover first.<br /><br />The Sony Music UK remastered edition has a better CD insert with lyrics and photos from the original vinyl LP.  The US MCA and Australian import CD inserts have nothing but the front cover.  More importantly, Sony Music UK remastered the audio using the original Jet Records master tapes.  As soon as I received the CD, I ripped it to the lossless FLAC audio format on my PC and began comparing it to the Australian import.  The difference was dramatic.<br /><br />The Australian import and MCA's US releases always sounded very muffled.  The remastered version sounds amazingly clear.  Separation of instruments and vocals are easier to distinguish and gives new life to this amazing soundtrack.  Jeff Lynne and Olivia-Newton John have never sounded better.  Do not make the mistake of buying any other version.  Get the Sony Music UK import version.  If you already own the 1998 US version by MCA or the Australian import like me, it's still worth getting the Sony Music UK remastered edition.  I bought a brand new copy from MovieMars-CDs and had no problems with them.roblems with them.
B00275EHJG|1.0|I bought this movie for my young clients in my clinic. however, it is not played till last ending. in the middle of the movie it is stuck and stop it.    first time I was think the video player would be wrong. therefore I tryed to play several time here and there. therefore, I found it was the CD problem.    I wasted money!!!!    Don't buy from Amazon.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I watched the series on HBO several years ago and really was surprised at the quality of the acting and direction of each episode.  The acting is superb and the story line is engaging.  There is more drama in this particular series compared to let's say, Spartacus blood and sand.  Both are good series however.  I think the series portrays the themes of the times and really captures the politics of the day.  Glad I live in modern times than at the time of the series.  Worth every penny.
B0000024K1|5.0|First cassette tape I ever owned (I think I was like 9) but the songs resonate both musically and lyrically years later.  This coming from a white guy who enjoys classical, 70s funk and electronic music.      Chuck D and crew are just plain excellent, I never get tired of these tracks.
B003YLM78K|5.0|I know it's not necessarily a holiday movie but I love this one - it's so quirky and human-natured. There are definately adult scenes and content and unless you want to explain what sex scene stand-ins are to your child, I highly recommend watching this with a mature audience. But the depiction of the relationships and the way we're all connected is really quite lovely.

1594202842|3.0|Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, by Amy Chua, has received a lot of press since its release early this year, much of which I have been reading.   As I listened to comments by callers over the BBC World Service or readers of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, many sounded like a thinly-veiled rants to a psychotherapist.  The book seems to have hit a nerve amongst both parents and children, and naturally so, given the impact of one's childhood and the raising of one's children.    While I have always been interested in cross-cultural issues (in this case, the comparison of \\"Chinese\\" vs. \\"Western\\" parenting styles), I wasn't too keen on buying this book because, frankly, I didn't think it would be that interesting.  However, I made the decision to purchase the book when I read reviews on Amazon by people who had actually read the book, many of whom saying that the media had only portrayed the more controversial portions of the book, and that the book itself was a great read and well written.    I ordered the book a couple of weeks ago, started it two days ago and just finished it 30 minutes ago.  My verdict?  The book was...just okay.  It was an easy read, but then again, so are Shopoholic books. It was well-written, but often with a technical feel - no beautiful prose here.   However, I give her points for her ascerbic wit, which made me wonder as to how much of the book should be taken literally, as opposed to her aiming to entertain her readers.    As for Chua's story about raising her children, the book confirmed my earlier instincts in that I did not find much of it to be that shocking or especially interesting. Early in the book, Chua confidently states that the \\"Chinese mother\\" is different from the \\"overscheduling soccer mom\\". But are they really that different from each other and other \\"types\\" of parents? By substituting the object (schoolwork/piano/violin vs. sports vs. being good), what you end up with is something much more universal (and not uncommon): parents with a narrow view of what success is (for themselves and their children), trial-and-error parenting (afterall, who in this world has gotten it perfect all the way through), children who fit into stereotypes (\\"rebel\\", \\"eldest\\", etc...) and at the same time be completely unique human beings.    In spite of my ennui to her life story, the book's value for me was in the conversation that has resulted (see above links to your friendly neighbourhood media outlet), not about Chua's parenting per se, but family relationships in my own life. Throughout the book, I reflected on how my parents raised me, the role my grandparents played and how, Insha'Allah, I might one day raise my own. Being a second generation Korean-Canadian myself (Chua's generation, albeit with no kids), I recognized Chua, Sophie and Lulu and poor Harvard Wong (a guy with aspiring parents who makes a cameo in the book) in many people in my life (including myself). Ultimately, I see as much value in Chua's parenting principles (many) as I see in Jed's, her husband (also, many) - and I think that is the point in this discourse: to each parent their own, let each one draw upon their own unique life experience in deciding what is best for their children.  [...].
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had to read this book for a children's literature class. I was not exactly turned on by the title, but a classmate assured me that it is actually a very good book. Was she ever right! There is action, romance, drama, and more. The storyline is very well laid out and gives enough time and information (and enough gaps in information) to make the reader care about the characters. I am yearning to read the rest of the trilogy, but will have to wait until after the end of the term. You can bet I will be seeking out the remaining two this summer!    (Also, this is the first book I could read and really enjoy because I finally bought a Kindle. I can make the text large enough and the paper doesn't glare back at my tired eyes. Turned out to be a VERY good investment for me, one who used to read constantly but has not been able to for pleasure for years.)
0786868724|4.0|I'm about halfway through this small book - the story of two religious leaders, vastly different in life stories, religions and styles. It brings Mitch back to the synagogue and rabbi of his youth - and provides a totally different look at a \\"reborn\\" minister serving the poorest people. Very interesting, though the bulk of the book centers on the rabbi.
030746363X|5.0|I've read my 150 page chunk (as recommended) and found there to be great actionable nuggets every couple pages.  I won't follow the whole book to a T, but I believe that those that would realize significant gains.  The book is written very practically, and is a fast easy read.<br /><br />Overall a good purchase and one I will go back to as a reference.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|If you are used to good/solid story telling - guys like Grishm or Sandford - you will be really disappointed.  This was my first Reacher novel - I was looking for some new authors - and the ratings seemed good.  But boy, the book was not.  It just does not hold water.  I've never read a book where I thought 'this is just dumb' more times than this one.  A person gets off an airplane and suddenly there are millions of people in the way...she dies.  Somebody is hiding for over a week, he is found with some ridiculous theory of counter clockwise movement and using the last names of the Beatles, he kills people with zero thought or remorse.  Just dumb - to the point where you will find yourself saying \\"this makes no sense at all\\".    Don't invest in this book.  The author lacks the story telling capabilities of many of his peers, and the characters have zero depth to them.  Rather than take the time to lay out a real plot, the main character just figures things out by divine intervention and pathetically bad storytelling.    ugh.  I was never so glad to finish a book in my life.
030746363X|5.0|I am a high school athlete and I have benefited immensely from this book. I still have so much more great things to go through, though. I'll be reading this book for a long time.
0446563048|2.0|I got this book for free from Amazon about a year ago and finally picked it up, hoping for some insight into the success for one of my favorite etailers, Zappos. Well, don't read this looking for business insights, inspiration or compelling anecdotes. What you'll get is stories about the author's many trips out for drinks with his buddies, repetitive narratives about not-very-interesting business meetings, and nearly nothing in the way of take-aways that you can apply to your own life or business. And the writing is dismal. Contrary to what he thinks, the author- and the reader-  would have benefited greatly from a professional writer and an editor with a red Sharpie.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Please, take an Editorial Review a part of what would it have pro at contra to make you watch this movie.   I was into tears soon after story turned out. Scene of Peter Appleton and his dad   is charged with emotions that are seldom seen in Hollywood these days; than movie begin jumping   haphazardly over the most important subjects in our lives: honestly, love, happiness. I find myself   hard to control tears and smile until the end. It is a beautiful movie; I enjoyed every beat, and will  probably have to see it a couple more times.
031603973X|5.0|Gorgeous! If I had only one word to describe this latest edition of A Christmas Carol: A Pop Up Book by Chuck Fischer and Bruce Foster, gorgeous would be it.<br /><br />This pop up book is a far cry from the pop books I had as a child. And in fact, such books are now put together in conjunction with \\"paper engineers\\" (in this case Foster). And I agree that a fair amount of engineering appears to be present in getting the pages to display correctly.<br /><br />I think, however, it is the artistry that really grabs the reader. Each page vividly depicts a pivotal moment in the story and adds greatly to the plot's impact. I especially liked the final happy scene that displays Scrooge and Tiny Tim celebrating in a beautiful Victorian village. The only caveat I would have to giving this book to a child is due to the delicacy of the pages as well as the fact that the story itself is contained in the book on five, small, paper leaflets (along with an additional background leaflet). Thus, If I were to give this to a young child I would recommend that an adult read the book with the child.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol: A Pop Up Book by Chuck Fischer and Bruce Foster would make a beautiful Christmas present for both adults and children!<br /><br />Hardcover: 12 pages, Ages 9-12.<br />Advance review copy provided courtesy of the publisher.
193413712X|4.0|I read this book right after having read Franzen's The Corrections.  Both feature dying men, suffering from Parkinsons, spending time in their basements with their hobbies. But instead of the acrid atmosphere that permeates Franzen's book, this is elegiac and dreamy. It is a beautifully written book that perhaps over indulges in the mystical aspects of the story, but is ultimately as good as any recent Pullitzer winner I've read. Fine work!
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I've gotta say the editorial review is right on for once. Someone also called them the \\"beach boys of winter\\" which works. Still I'll jump in. This is easily one of my favorite new bands of the past few years, along with Beach House and Black Mountain. There is a very earthy sound here, almost ancient at times. It's like if a supergroup was formed with members of Buffalo Springfield, My Morning Jacket and Dead Can Dance. I find this music very visual too. Half the tracks here make me invision an old cabin in the mountains, where the locals gather to sing songs of joy at the last mounds of snow melting away, and the goats and sheep begin to frolic...and maybe foxes.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Sandra played her part incredibly well as did the other performers.  The fact that is is based on a true story makes it so incredibly meaningful!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Ozark-noir. It's a new genre. Winter's Bone is the reason why. This second film from Debra Granik is an atmospheric, lean, nasty mystery set among the trailers, dilapidated houses, and broken down cars of an unfortunate Ozarks mountain community. Our hero is 17-year-old Ree Dolly (imbued with fearlessness and gravitas by 20 year old Jennifer Lawrence), who we see taking care of her two young siblings and mentally damaged mother. She hunts for squirrels, teaches her brother and sister how to shoot, and generally works to hold their world together. We quickly understand that this is a girl with experience and responsibility far beyond her age. She has been forced to grow up much too fast and the trials she endures through the course of Winter's Bone only reinforce this sad fact. Ree's dad, a local meth cook, has disappeared after posting the bond for his latest arrest. He put up the family home and land as collateral. Ree must find him and make sure he appears in court, or they will lose everything. She sets out on a nightmarish journey of the community and the network of drug dealers, criminals, and miscreants that inhabit it. It becomes increasingly clear what awaits the girl at the end of her journey, and although armed with this vile knowledge, audiences will be unable to look away.<br /><br />Winter's Bone pulls no punches - this is a hard film full of hard people living what look to be very hard lives. It should come as no surprise that it can be hard to watch at times. For those used to the world of noir consisting solely of the seedy nightclubs and alleys of L.A., the setting and mood of Winter's Bone will provide a sharp rebuke. This is the most atmospheric movie of the year and the oppressive, cold gloom settles on the characters, the rusted out cars, and the dilapidated trailers like the thick fog of the Ozarks. This bleakness extends beyond the direction and setting to the characters and performances. Jennifer Lawrence is a revelation here, establishing her character Ree as a force to be reckoned with even though she is just a teenager. She may be naïve and unprepared for the danger that awaits her, but she will not yield and Lawrence captures this resolute attitude perfectly. It is a subtle and brilliant performance, but the real showstopper is Teardrop, Ree's frightening drug-addicted uncle, played by John Hawkes in a mesmerizing performance.<br /><br />As played by Hawkes, Teardrop's presence looms over the entire film, and it quickly becomes clear that he is rightly feared by just about everyone. Hawkes has made a career of playing sympathetic nice guys, most famously Sol Starr in Deadwood and more recently Dustin Powers in Eastbound and Down, but here Hawkes shuffles about, all 150 pounds of him, with a look that will chill you to the bone. It is the kind of performance that makes even the most casual observer sit straight up in rapt attention. I have a bad feeling, that Oscar is going to ignore John Hawkes come nomination day, but everyone who sees this film will know that his performance is one of the best committed to celluloid in recent memory.<br /><br />I want to go on, but it's probably best not to divulge any further plot points or details, lest I ruin this dark journey into the criminal world of the Ozarks. This is a brave film, led by two powerful performances and a heavy atmosphere of dread and gloom.

She may be naïve and unprepared for the danger that awaits her, but she will not yield and Lawrence captures this resolute attitude perfectly. It is a subtle and brilliant performance, but the real showstopper is Teardrop, Ree's frightening drug-addicted uncle, played by John Hawkes in a mesmerizing performance.    As played by Hawkes, Teardrop's presence looms over the entire film, and it quickly becomes clear that he is rightly feared by just about everyone. Hawkes has made a career of playing sympathetic nice guys, most famously Sol Starr in Deadwood and more recently Dustin Powers in Eastbound and Down, but here Hawkes shuffles about, all 150 pounds of him, with a look that will chill you to the bone. It is the kind of performance that makes even the most casual observer sit straight up in rapt attention. I have a bad feeling, that Oscar is going to ignore John Hawkes come nomination day, but everyone who sees this film will know that his performance is one of the best committed to celluloid in recent memory.    I want to go on, but it's probably best not to divulge any further plot points or details, lest I ruin this dark journey into the criminal world of the Ozarks. This is a brave film, led by two powerful performances and a heavy atmosphere of dread and gloom. You may not \\"enjoy \\" Winter's Bone in the traditional sense, but this is a film that, through the skill of the performances and quality of the direction, will demand and receive your respect and admiration. 5 out of 5 stars.

030746363X|5.0|After reading the good reviews and the bad reviews, I had hesitated on getting this book.  What ultimately drove me to purchase the book was how much I got from Tim's previous book, The Four Hour Work Week.  His writing style carries over to this book and within a few pages I found myself smiling at the unique, unfiltered writing style of Tim Ferriss.  I have to admit, there were a few chapters I breezed through as they were not for me and my current goals.  But, what's important to note is that one of the very first things Tim will tell you in this book is to skip around! Be skeptical!  To me, this book was about \\"Hey, this is how I did it and what worked for me, now you go try and feel free to tweak\\".  People who take this book as a literal how-to are missing the point.  The point is to open yourself up to self-experimentation and find what works for you.  Keep tweaking until you get the most results with the least amount of effort.  With that said, I have to focus in on the first few chapters.  While I'm not following the slow-carb diet to the T, I'm down from 225 to 215 and I had 3 trips to great restaurants Saturday in which I partook in meals such as NY Strip Steak, Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi and Chocolate Rasberry Truffle Chessecake to name a few. (Thank you cheat day!)  I hardly work out and just by using Tim's map of what I can and can't eat I've changed my eating habits drastically with minimum motivation.  If you're curious about this book and wondering if it could help you with your specific goals, just look at the table of contents.  If there's anything you want to do, from losing weight to jumping higher, it's worth checking out.
B002ZG9940|4.0|Decent movie with great scenery, especially in blu-ray Hi-Definition. Reminded me of an old time Spy Movie. No explosions, and really no car chases. Artsy, but good. I would like to mention that only one disc comes in the case, and not two as stated. Apparently, the \\"Digital Copy\\" has to be downloaded via Internet, and is only available for a limited time...Pete
B000HEWEJO|3.0|First of all I got It's a Wonderful Life on Amazon thinking it would be the cheapest place, however, I was wrong. Second of all, I am disappointed that the movie did not come with an inlet inside that shows the movie's chapters and all.

B002RKSZS0|4.0|Knowing this was one of the first of Jane Austin's works, I was a bit wary when I began to read it. It was thoroughly enjoyable.     Catherine Moreland's imagination is in full swing. Much is harmless and no more than a young girl enjoying herself. An imagination out of control gets her in to a bit of trouble. In the end, all's well that ends well.... well worth the read!    In fact, a few weeks after I read it, I was pleasantly suprised to find it showing on Masterpiece Theater! After seeing it on the screen, it made me want to read the book all over again!    (P.S. Making an attempt at Mansfield Park, and I must say Northanger Abby is MUCH, MUCH better!)
0316044695|4.0|Actually this is two books combined....the first details the training of the SEAls....the second tells of a mission this SEAL team was asaigned which seemed to be hopeless from the start. Four of our best assigned to capture one of the eneney's major figures seems to be rather ill concieved.  What amazes me is where do men like Mr.Luttrell come from? Their courage, devotion to duty,resolve seem to be beyond belief yet they keep showing up when needed.  In this case there is absolutely no question of the  bravery and courage of Mr.Luttrell.  However, that being said, I think Mr.Luttrell must remember that he volunteered to do exactly what he did, his very training was for this type of situation. But I am also of the impression that he was sent on an impossible mission that was compounded by mistakes they themselves made, primarily releasing the Taliban goatkeepers right at the beginning of their battle. From then on it was a lost cause, and Mr.Lutrell was probably the luckiest man in Afghanistan at that time to survive the result of this bad decision, which by the way seemed to be contrary to the training they had received in SEAL training. I also agree with other's comments that Mr. Lutrell or at least his co-author, Mr. Robinson should have refrained in trying to blame the whole episode on the \\"liberals\\" whomever they may be. I really doubt that Mr. Luttrell was thinking of the \\"liberal press\\" in the midst of a fight for his very life. He may have negative thoughts about the media etc., but to interject them in the middle of various life threatening situations does not seem plausibe and I am of the impression that Mr. Robinson inserted some of his own thinking. This was not really meant to be a book about conservative/liberal differeces but rather one to show what courage, heriocs, determination, can accomplish.  I will recommend this book to many of my younger friends because I think Mr. Luttrell is an example of the outstanding individuals this country produces.He is certainly a hero!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|After reading all the other great reviews here on Amazon,I could't resist buying it and taking a look myself.It's not that I didn't believe a black & white movie that was made in 1960 could live up to those high expectations,but I really wanted to see for myself.Well,I must say that I agree 100%  This is easily one of the best video & audio transfers to Blu-ray that I've came across from ANY year of origin.The black & white picture is dead perfect,with no signs of wear or artifacts of any sort.The same goes for the newly created DTS-HD Master Audio...WOW.This 50th anniversary edition also includes a ton of great special features (check the item description for the compleate list).All in all,I cannot see any reason anyone who purchases this could be disappointed in any way.I just wish ALL Blu-ray transfers could even be 50% this good.To relive the experience you had when you first saw this great movie,just but it and see for yourself.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|This book was a journey of the heart  for me.  I went thru every phase of  his challenged life with him.  I felt  it all.  It was masterfully done.  It  shows us all that we can accomplish  any and all things if we believe it.  The fact that he had to literally   carry his child around and thru most   of his exhausting experiences was a  daily mountain to climb-and he climbed  it.  A powerful story for these    economic times. GREAT MOVIE & TRUE.

I don't know who's to blame - the BBC, the Beatles themselves, or whoever they gave the job of making prints to , but I don't think there's any reason to think this DVD has been \\"pirated\\" - it's looked (and sounded) like this from the start.

B003H6KRIE|3.0|three movies of bourne fighting the cia gets rather old. Then it got even older in the green zone movie. Hollywood is obsessed with bad cia agents who go rogue etc. However bourne oould have gone on to fight some psycho terrorists and that would have alot more fun for me. The blu rays look great but I sold mine off , it's like 'mission impossible' or agent fights the evil american series.  This is better than that series but still the main story was a 1970's themed thing. The evil cia wants to get him.......  most likely they'd just fire him.
030746363X|5.0|A concise and practical guide to get the results you want.  Tim shares his invaluable advice, and his stories of self-experimentation.

Still 5 stars because if I know Tim, the resources are on their way.

0061122416|5.0|Paolo Coelho again expresses his genius by sharing his wisdom through the book The Alchemist. In the story you follow Santiago in his journey for the meaning of alchemy and his dreams. The idea that is being portrayed is to follow and trust your heart because the wisdom it shares with you is priceless.I would say that, this is a book worth reading with its wisdom and adventure. I believe that the book would suit young readers as well because of the simple word choice and comprehension. John Lopez - VII
B0044KU7KU|1.0|My Chemical Romance used to be my life. They got me through high school. They were inspiring, different, powerful and, in my own opinion, perfect. I liked *I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.* I LOVED *Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.* *The Black Parade* was flawless. I owned every song they ever owned. I listened to unreleased tracks over and over again. I bought their live albums, the whole shebang. Honestly, when I first listened to this album, I could hardly see straight. Who is this band? What have they become? As much as it kills me to say it, My Chemical Romance SOLD OUT which is the worst possible thing any truly great band can do. The My Chemical Romance I know and loved would never have let something like this leave their studio. I waited FOUR YEARS for this album. I don't know if I've ever been more disappointed in my entire life. Every true MCR fan knows exactly what I'm talking about. This album is for 14-year-old girls.    I know it sounds really harsh. But the truth is that My Chemical Romance is dead.
B002ZG994U|4.0|Pros: Theatrical, extended, commentary, Theme Montage, Trailor.  Cons: Came in a less plastic case with holes over and under the disk area (tossed it for one with the disk part fully covered), no blooper reel.
0143105566|5.0|Graham Greene, an author who focused on contemporary political and moral issues of his day, was raised Catholic and each of his novels have Christian themes woven throughout. His realistic prose highlights the battle against evil in each man, and The Human Factor is one of his best works.<br /><br />Maurice Castle, the protagonist of the story, is a conflicted spy. He goes to work each day, pushes papers at the office, and comes home to a loving family each night. The book focuses on family, patriotism, and race, but still has all of the great elements of a spy novel. In fact, many think that it is the greatest spy novel ever written.<br /><br />This book will provoke you to think about things in ways that only fiction can do. Race, apartheid, loyalty, family, religion, Africa, and many other subjects are turned inside out in the space of just a few chapters. The Human Factor is an espionage novel that will grip you from the first few pages and one you will think about long after you have turned the last page. I highly recommend it.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|love this show so much. cant wait til the 7th season is available. the place i ordered it from was good. got movie quickly
B003MZ0I84|4.0|For being an entire album dedicated to love, it is surprisingly not one note!  The themes deal with desire, regret, adoration, breaking up, and moving on.  The lyrics are charming, even funny at times.  This is all intertwined with that classic Maroon 5 sound that makes you want to dance.  It's upbeat, cheerful, toe tapping - even when he's heartbroken.      I don't think you'll regret the purchase.  The whole album is good, not a single bad song on it.

B001G8XON0|4.0|Love him or hate him, you can't deny Aussie director Baz Luhrmann's vaulting ambition which came to eye-popping, quick-cutting, over-the-top fruition in 2001's Best Picture nominee, MOULIN ROUGE!  With the goal of re-inventing the movie musical, as he did Shakespeare in his earlier kinetic interpretation of ROMEO + JULIET, Luhrmann co-wrote (with Craig Pearce) this ultimately tragic romance sprinkled with silly comedy, can-can girls and a soundtrack made up of pop songs from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Dolly Parton to Nirvana and set in the Bohemian world of the infamous 1899 Paris nightclub that in the director's hands makes Studio 54 look like Romper Room.    Ewan McGregor plays Christian, a young (he was probably about 15 years too old for the part), inexperienced British writer who comes to Paris and the wild, sexy, absinthe-tinged world of the Moulin Rouge in search of love and life experience.  As the story is told in flashback, we know from the start he's going to find it, and it's not going to end well.     The star of the Moulin Rouge stage is Nicole Kidman's beautiful courtesan, Satine.  When Christian is enlisted by none other than Toulouse-Letrec (John Leguizamo) and his merry prankster sidekicks to write a musical stage spectacular called SPECTACULAR, SPECTATCULAR, Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge (a rollicking Jim Broadbent), mistakes the penniless writer for a rich financier, and Christian finds himself in Satine's opulent boudoir.  Among farcically comic misunderstandings, Christian and Satine fall in love while crooning Elton John and Bernie Taupin's \\"Your Song\\" in the most starry-eyed of the film's dazzlingly romanticized musical number.    But everything in MOULIN ROUGE! is dazzling.  With cinematic influences from Jean Renoir's FRENCH CAN-CAN to Max Ophuls' LOLA MONTES to Bob Fosse's CABARET to any number of Bollywood extravaganzas, Baz Luhrmann pumps up the visual and aural volume to eleven and pretty much pulls it off.  Backed by productiondesigner and co-costume designer Catherine Martin, who walked off with the film's two Oscars, and Don McAlpine's stunning Oscar-nominated cinematography, Baz Luhrmann's colorful vision practically pops off the screen.     Kidman (nominated for Best Actress) and McGregor make an appealing couple, and their heartfelt handling of the film's musical numbers is surprisingly effective if not always technically perfect.  The staging and choreography is fresh and exciting (though a bit ADD over-edited), and by the time Satine's tuberculosis brings the film to its inevitable tragic-opera denouement, you know that this filmmaker has taken you on a one-of-a-kind cinematic ride.

I saw the '90s movie and read Little Vampire Women, but still did not pick up the book. Finally I decided to download it. I cannot believe I never read it before. It was such a great book.

B004AOECUG|5.0|Martin Scorsese's RAGING BULL, considered by many the best film of its decade, was released in 1980 to mixed critical response and middling box office.  On the long \\"Oscar Gets It Wrong\\" list, you'll find RAGING BULL's Best Picture and Best Director loss to Robert Redford's ORDINARY PEOPLE near the top.  While I'm an admirer of Redford's finely tuned, emotionally wrought family drama, it clearly doesn't embody the bold vision and stylistic daring of Scorsese's masterpiece, which garnered eight nominations and two wins (Best Actor for Robert DeNiro and Best Editing for Thelma Schoonmaker).    So why did the Academy knock Scorsese's black and white character study of brutal middle-weight boxer, Jake LaMotta, out of the ring?  Looking at RAGING BULL again with 30 years of perspective, my best guess is it comes down to the story the picture tells.     One of the primary screenwriting tenets is \\"character arc.\\"  How does the main character change from the beginning to the end of the film?  Usually, it involves some kind of salvation or redemption, realization or growth.  RAGING BULL gives the viewer none of that.  DeNiro's Lamotta is essentially the same violent, emotionally clueless character at the end of the movie as at the start.  After years of beatings in and out of the ring, he has completely alienated the two people who mean the most to him - his brother/manager Joey (Joe Pesci) and second wife, Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) - and is a bloated shadow of his former self, reduced to telling bad jokes to heckling drunks in his own sleazy nightclub.    Scorsese and screenwriters Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader steadfastly refuse to give LaMotta a final moment of redemption - a hallmark of commercial filmmaking - and certainly, boxing movies.  His in-ring victories are more an expression of the triumph of brute force - doling it out and taking it - than any admirable inner qualities of the man.  When that violence repeatedly spills into LaMotta's personal life, it leaves him as psychically damaged as he is physically.  In one of the film's most powerful moments, locked in a Dade County jail cell, LaMotta relentlessly pounds his fists and head into the concrete wall.  He realizes he's completely screwed up his life.  But does it change him?  Nope.    What really gives RAGING BULL its classic status is the sheer quality of the filmmaking.  With Michael Chapman's stunning cinematography, Schoonmaker's explosive editing, and the rich performances of his cast, Scorsese fashioned a ravishing, monochromatic treatise on violence in the national character of post-war America.  His startlingly innovative direction of the boxing sequences gave each match its own, unique stylistic jolt, while staying true to the events of the real-life bouts.      Leading the impressive cast, DeNiro famously put himself through a 40-pound weight gain to play the older Jake LaMotta.  The physical contrast with the younger, muscular fighter gave his portrayal an astonishing veracity.  But it's a performance that is powerful throughout.  You never know when his LaMotta is going to explode.  But when he does, Scorsese's camera makes you feel every blow.

B00065GX64|5.0|In a modern age where the on-screen villian has evolved into a layered creature filled with complexity and, often, sympathetic character traits, the modern movie-goer may look at Fritz Lang's masterwork, M, and be unable to appreciate the groundbreaking originality of such a premise.  M (1931) has the destinction of being the very first film about a serial killer, and a child murderer at that.  Rather than dwell on the killer's past and personality defects, Fritz Lang brilliantly crafts an intricate game of cat-and-cat-and-mouse.  On one side, the police, who crack down on crime in an effort to find \\"Die Kinder Morder,\\" but realize that their efforts are futile, as they have no real leads.  On the other side, the criminal underworld, who attempt to hunt the murderer so business can resume as usual.  In the middle, our elusive and psychotic killer, played with amazing energy by classic film actor Peter Lorre.  Along with Lang's striking pre-noir approach to filming (with the use of long shadows, quick-cut editing and unique framing ten years before Orson Welles's Citizen Kane), Peter Lorre's third act confession is staggeringly heartbreaking, giving the audience an insight into the mind of a monster, which we, as a society, would not begin exploring until decades later, when the number of serial killers began to multiply.  Anyone who considers themself a movie buff or a student of film absolutely must see M.  It is a masterpiece by every meaning of the word, and is considered to be Fritz Lang's greatest achievement as a director.  This 2-Disc Criterion Collection edition of M is the best presentation I have seen of the film.  It has been restored with high-definition digital transfer, and possibly looks clearer and sharper than it did onscreen in 1931.  For those who dread subtitles, these are improved translations, and flow smoothly throughout with no stumbling confusion.  This DVD also comes with several fantastic special features, including essays, interviews and\\"Conversation with Fritz Lang,\\" a 50-minute film by William Friedkin (director of The Exorcist and The French Connection).  For any lover of Fritz Lang's M, this is the ultimate DVD.

0321687299|5.0|When this book arrived, I dove right in and must say that this is a practical guide on HTML5. It delves into some of the more major topics and does not bore you with too much technicality and code examples. Explanations are crisp and clear, no technical jargon that would even make the most seasoned professional shake their head and put the book down.    Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp are two seasoned professionals that have their heads wrapped around the topics they speak about and write about. The book isn't a guide where the reader has blinders put on, but has some whimsical jokes here and there that kept me reading and chuckling through the book, which held my attention longer than some of the other books I have purchased on web design and development before in the past.    From the first page to the last, I was left with no questions, just straight answers on topics that picked apart some of the topics of HTML5 that I had been wondering about. This book, not being an in-depth manual on HTML5 satisfies my curiosity and sparks my advancement of research on HTML5, when and how to implement it, and even makes me want to experiment with the technologies that HTML5 offers and create my own web apps.    Content surely is number one when it comes to my purchasing of a book. Introducing HTML5 does this with such \\"perfection\\", it left me wanting more. I also used the companion web site to follow along and try out some of the examples from the book and use the links from the companion site to do further research into topics and read a bit more into each chapter.    Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp do a wonderful job explaining what works, how it works, and what does not work. Briefly going into some detail into what will work in what browsers and how it works in some cases. This made things a bit more clear for me when it came to certain topics like Geolocation and Web Workers.    If there was ever a book that I had anticipated getting and reading, it is Introducing HTML5. If everthere was a book that did not leave me disappointed, but rather left me wanting more and a book I would definitely read again, it is Introducing HTML5.

030746363X|5.0|Ferriss delivers the goods! When I came across his book, his experimental approach to weight loss and body building appealed to me. I read it straight through and then went back and concentrated on the basics section. Following Ferriss's guidelines, I have lost 5 1/2 pounds over the past week. All of this without the usual hunger torture I have experienced in dieting in the past. I am 63 years old and the past year has introduced me to a lot of new aches and pains. Since beginning the exercises Tim recommends, especially with the kettleball, I am beginning to move more freely and with less pain. I am looking forward to how I will feel at the end of the month if this keeps up.<br /><br />I don't know how far into some of the more esoteric stuff Ferriss presents that I will get, but I can truthfully say that his book has already earned its purchase price many times over. If you get the book and then DO what Tim suggests, I can almost guarantee that you will benefit greatly. Disclaimer: I am in no way associated with Tim Ferriss and the above is my genuine opinion.
0385341679|5.0|I decided to go back and read the first four books before jumping into this one- mostly so my memory would be fresh on everything that happened leading up to this book and so I could savor the total series- I am glad I did.  This book was awesome and wrapped most everything up, but in very unexpected ways.  Let me just say, if you think you have guessed the answers to anything that hasn't been answered in the first four books- you really haven't!  I have been anticipating this book for what seems like forever and it not only didn't disappoint, it was actually better then I could have possibly imagined!  Not only did I enjoy it, but my husband, who has been reading the series with me, also loved it and was completely surprised with how everything was wrapped up, and he can normally figure out what is going to happen before he is halfway through a book.  If you have read the other books, but haven't picked up this one yet, do it now- you won't be disappointed.  I can't wait for her next book in this world!  If you haven't read the series and are looking for a great series with a fabulous, very surprising story line, I HIGHLY recommend this series- you will love it!

B0041KKYEM|1.0|I hadn't seen a movie in 15 months, roared out of long wait in doctor's office to make the noon showing, thought I'd see a gorgeously made movie full of dance, beautiful people and an adult psycholgical drama of girls competing for the starring role in a classic dance.    What I got was:    Grainy picture, handheld camera work so bouncy I had to look away from the screen or upchuck my $6.00 popcorn. Why was the camera man so fixated on the nape of Portman's neck???? and why was ever other scene a severe closeup?    Lots of blood (Lots!) from self-mutilation to hallucinated murders of rejecting lesbian lovers and (I think?) a suicide at the end?    More masturbation scenes than I cared to see. The audience was uncomfortable to say the least.    Unfortunately I got duped by Oscar hype. This wasn't an adult drama, but somewhere between soft porn and teen-aged splatter movies and some sci-fi thrown in (Nina morphing into a black swan at the end.)

0385341679|3.0|*SERIOUS SPOILERS*<br />*DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK**<br /><br />I didn't have to wait years to read this book but you can still count me as disappointed, also. I read the whole series for the first time this month and fell in love with the author and Mac. But, the final book, honestly, didn't live up to the others (even though it's still MILES ahead of most other urban fantasies). I was OK with the introspection even when it involved pages and pages of hardship because I was anticipating a fantastic ending. I had hoped that Mac would become the new queen and Barrons would be the king. Instead, we get a \\"maybe that'll happen one day, maybe not\\" dismissal from the real king. Wwwwhat?<br /><br />That Barrons was a creature, one of 9, without anything to do with the Seelie or Unseelie world and that Mac was a biological copy of the book (and one of the Unseelie King's children) without anything to do with the concubine or the Seelie Queen... disappointed me. That Barron's was not epic enough to activate the amulet, disappointed me, too. But maybe that's because I was expecting SO much. \\"Joy can only fill you as much as sorrow has carved you\\" meant more to me than a barbeque with Barrons and Mac's parents at the end. Sigh.<br /><br />I agree the romance was a little thin. I loved the sexy build up scene in the white mansion but when it was time for the big, uhm, \\"climax\\" it was just as another reviewer says, hardcore and drowning in introspection. When Mac said, \\"Wait\\" because she wanted to savor the beginning part, I thought, \\"YES! Please wait! Please slow down! We didn't get to see Barrons having sex with her for the first time when she was pri-ya, now we'll finally get that chance!\\" But the only thing that happened was more talking. Then, he was f'in her. I've never been a V'lane shipper but at least his kisses got some narrative description. If the Big Scene between Mac and Barrons had had as much description of kissing and where everyone's hands were,it would have been sooo much better!<br /><br />Actually, V'lane, I thought, was really mistreated. When Mac wasn't leading him on, she was using him to run her errands... and he was *eager* to do it! He seemed truly enamored with her, yet at the end, when the chips are down, his feelings for her are swept under the rug and never addressed. \\"Yeah, I raped you. Big deal.\\" was his response?? That would have been a believable response in the first book. But by the end, I thought it was way out of character -even considering who he really was. If he had wanted to overthrow the king and set up Mac as the new queen... *that* would have been plausible. But, nope. Not mentioned. Was he suppose to have been faking his romantic interest in her the whole time? I don't buy that.<br /><br />Also, why did he bring Mac's parents to the finale? Surely he knew he didn't need to protect them, anymore. Why was Barron's able to be in Fairy to seduce V'lanes princess, once upon a time? What was that story about? Also, how is it that he can kill the fae? And whatever happened to the first inspector investigating Alina's death? Did Barron's really slit his throat and leave him for the Gardia to find? Is Mac OK with that? In fact, is Mac OK with the fact that Barrons has been feeding innocent human women to his child for ages? Has she changed *that* much? Is that what Barrons eats, too?? And whatever happened to the amulet that indicated she was epic? I don't think she needed it to subdue the book, after all. So, now that the book is entombed, does she still have it? What does she plan to do with it? Yes, questions and questions. Maybe I missed some facts and clues and need to re-read.<br /><br />Rowena's death was OK. But I wanted to see her publicly revealed to all of the sidhe-seers before she died. Trapped by her own double crossing and traitorous activity should have been the way she went down. But as it was, it happened so suddenly. After it was revealed that she was behind Alina'sdeath, there should have been a more dramatic showdown. In my opinion, Rowena was just as bad as Darroc. Yet, her death was easy compared to Fiona's and the O'Bannion brother.<br /><br />Now that I've written this, it occurs to me that maybe the book didn't get as much editing as the others. There were words and descriptions used over and over again (like bipolar. Why not sometimes say \\"conflicted\\" or \\"torn\\"?) and I think that added to the tedious feeling of so many pages. One of the things I loved about the fourth book was that it didn't spend a lot of time dwelling on Mac's rape. In about 10 pages or so, Mac went from the lowest point ever to being in bed with Barrons. I was sooooo grateful for that! I wish the author would have done the same thing in this book. Instead, after Barrons was killed, it was *150* pages of dark, depression before a ray of sunshine. This is where a good edit would have done the most good, I think.<br /><br />I believe the author is a genius, don't get me wrong. I will read every book she publishes and will look forward to the next fae series with eager, baited breath. There was a lot to love in this book (the white mansion was *incredible* and the story of the concubine and the king was breathtaking). Also, the suspense in the series! Trying to guess what was going to happen next and who was playing what cards, was a huge thrill. I also thought the writer used Mac's transition from girl to woman to make some of the most poignantly true insights into life, I've ever read. In fact, some of that stuff, I felt like she had picked out of *my* deepest, darkest thoughts. So, while this wasn't my favorite book of hers, I am still SOOO glad she wrote this series! Actually, I'm glad for everything she writes -even this one. Her books have brought me a lot of joy. :)

1594202842|5.0|Before I start this review, I wanted to say that I haven't read any of the other reviews about this book. I am writing this review purely from my own viewpoint and from my own experiences of being raised by a Chinese mother. I was excited to read this book for two main reasons. 1) I'm half Chinese and therefore was raised by a Chinese mother and 2) I'm looking to expand my reading this year and am reading a lot more books dealing with Asian culture.<br /><br />There were many occasions while reading that I would call out to my husband (who is Caucasian) at how similar this was to my childhood or how I could relate very much to what Chua was saying. Several things stood out to me that I know others have problems with. Chua didn't let her go on sleepovers, play dates or be in school plays among other things. Her main concern was that they focus on their music as well as their studies. Well growing up, my parents didn't really let us do any of that either. And I'm not weird or abnormal. If we did go to a sleepover, like Chua's daughters, we came back extremely grumpy and irritable forcing them to come to the conclusion that sleepovers were not the best for us at such a young age. We did have friends in school and in church but mostly we kept to ourselves. When you have sisters, you pretty much have built in playmates.<br /><br />Many of the things that Chua said about how Asian immigrant parents view their children and their way of living also mirrored what happened in my home as well. There are some points in the book where I agreed with what she said about how some Western parents do tend to molly-coddle their kids whereas Asian parents would be more strict. There were times when I was growing up when I wondered why instead of complimenting me on what I did well, my mother would focus on what I didn't do well instead. However now I know that she wanted me to focus on my weak points, not to make me feel bad, but to improve on them. I do feel that discipline is a lot more prevalent in most Asian families that I know. Note: My parents did not raise me as strict as Chua did her kids, therefore if she had, I would be a total failure.<br /><br />I don't agree with everything that she did however. There are some parts in the book where I thought she went too far with how much she wanted her daughters to practice their instruments. She also said in the book that she never thought about doing this to get recognition for her own self but there are times during the story where I felt that she was just like pageant mothers. Why else should Lulu play at her own Bat Mitzvah than simply to show off to everyone how well she does when the audience will consist of nothing but family and friends who will congratulate the parents? Also, I was NOT a fan of her tearing up her children's birthday cards. Her reasoning was that since she spent the big bucks and time and effort on their birthday parties, they should spend equal amount and fervor for her birthday. Well maybe, her kids didn't want big parties.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book. This book is extremely readable. Chua's narrative flows very smoothly and it's really easy to get hooked into her story. I know that there are MANY people who disagree with Chua's way of parenting. I know that there are a lot of people who are angry with how she treated her kids and that what she did borders on child abuse. I also know that there are many Asian American kids who despise their parents for treating them in the same way Chua treated her kids. For me, however, I will just say that first before you say anything or make any judgments, you need to read the entire book first. After that, I still feel like there are just some things a lot of people, mainly those in Western culture, won't get unless you've grown up and been raised in an Asian environment. While I don't agree with ALL of Chua's parenting techniques, there are some that absolutely make sense. My parents raised me like that and I came out a perfectly decent (if not geeky) person and I hope that my own children will come out that way. If anything at all, this book will create a lot of discussion after reading it, regardless of what your feelings are before reading.ot geeky) person and I hope that my own children will come out that way.

B002ZG9774|5.0|Burlesque was such a breath of fresh air. Costumes, singing, and dancing were fabulous! The story may have been predictable but who cares? This movie is so entertaining! Christina did great in her movie debut. She's not the strongest actress but her performance was a great start and, boy, can that girl sing! Cher was simply a goddess and a half in her part as Tess and let it be known that her performance of \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\\" was roof-raising. The woman is 64. Her voice is INCREDIBLE. Age doesn't slow that woman down. Cher and Stanley Tucci had the absolute best lines that were laugh-out-loud hilarious. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out. Buy it. Rent it. Netflix it. Whatever you have to do. Just get your Burlesque on!
1439156816|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed 'On writing'. All at once - it is helpful and illuminating; and all without being dull. Yes, he is a convert to the Strunk and White way of doing things (psss...he doesn't like adverbs), but at least he has made a decision - and he sticks to it - well, most of the time anyway. Enough said.
1594202842|5.0|This book is like a breathe of fresh air. Of course it will be excoriated in our culture where passive and permissive parenting has grown so rampant. Amy Chua delivers a \\"wake-up\\" call that caring parents will prepare their children for the growing realities of the global economy. This is timely message that is sparking a healthy dialogue. I recently taught for a year in an urban elementary school. The one student in my class who demonstrated respect and hard work - was from China.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Take all the good stuff you've heard from previous reviewers and believe it.  I had goosebumps watching the opening of the movie with Julie Andrews on the hill.  The difference between the new bluray version and the previous version isn't even a comparison.  The sound improvement is even noticeable on my Sony flatscreen.  The picture is amazing.  It's like I've rediscovered the movie all over again!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very good book...probably one of the best I have ever read. I couldn't put the book down, and when I did all I could think about was when I could read some more!
030746363X|5.0|I bought this book because of a blog post by Nate Green ([...]).    I was intrigued by the blurblets focusing on how to gain a lot of muscle or lose weight. I purchased the kindle version and I actually read the whole thing in just a few days. The book is funny and it flows nicely. I like the speaker's point of view and I enjoy how straight-forward he is on everything he discusses.    Unlike others he doesn't bore you with endless pages of why his idea is so great before finally telling you the details - only to give generalities. He actually gives you step-by-step instructions with the reasons behind them.     Skeptical? Thats ok too because he provides multiple sources and options to further research.    He doesn't tell you something works; he explains how it worked for him and others and guides you to find your own experience with it.    The point is to get you to think for yourself and learn about your own body.    Too many workout programs, nutrition guides and self-help books simply lump everybody into a single group. Tim gives you strict rules to follow but allows you to be individual within those rules.     No workouts involving multiple machines while balancing on a ball and holding your breathe. No recipes where you have to fly to india just to find the key ingredient. No advice only relevant to wealthy 20 year olds in California or retired businessmen.     This book really offers a place for everybody to find a way to follow the rules and still get results within their own lives.    Women might find the book too male-centric and gay men might find the entire sex-section amusingly irrelevant...but the book was designed by the author's own experience. He can't experience everything!    Besides he shouldn't have to. This is his hard work reaching out to us to let us know of a few things he researched, tested and proved true.     As a gay guy I can say that the hetero-bits did not distract from the message and he makes a huge effort to include the female perspective in everything he discusses.    The big question: Does any of it work?    Well it worked for him and it has worked for many many people. I am still testing it so I don't know yet. The point is for me to find out how my body responds and act accordingly.    The best you can do is trust that after everything he put himself through - the least you can do is try.    In any case this is a fantastic perfect gift for any straight man out there, it has a lot of value for the gay ones and women can learn a whole lot as well.

As for the show itself: everything from the season-specific menus to the crystal clear HD and 5.1 sound is exemplary.  The easter eggs are fun to look for (if the features themselves tend to be short and superfluous).  Well worth the money, and I'm very much looking forward to getting Lost again!

1439153663|4.0|The Kitchen House is about a young Irish girl, Lavinia, whose parents die on board the ship bringing the family to America. Lavinia finds herself an indentured servant... one step up from slavery, but one step below freedom. I found the premise of the story intriguing and couldn't wait to read this novel, but when I'd gotten fairly started, I discovered a lot of problems with the story... beginning with the prologue. The dramatic prologue of The Kitchen House serves to draw the reader into the story rather quickly, so it's not all bad. however, I must say that I've never been a fan of this method of storytelling. By reading this prologue, the reader is peeking ahead to a scene much later in the book, which, to me, feels like cheating. I also felt the prologue was better written than the ending of the story, or rather, that part of the ending which used the same information.<br /><br />From the prologue on through the first half of the novel, I kept having a sense of deja-vu, otherwise known as \\"where have I read this before?\\"  I have yet to figure out why this novel seems so familiar.<br /><br />And then we have the story being told from two viewpoints; an adult black slave - Belle - who also happens to be the master's daughter; and the young white indentured servant girl from Ireland - Lavinia. Stories told from multiple viewpoints must be delicately handled to be related smoothly; and sorry to say, the author didn't do so well with this. The transitions between Belle's chapters and Lavinia's chapters were sometimes confusing and often as rough as the storm-tossed sea. Mostly this seemed to be the case with Belle's part of the story.<br /><br />The other main problems I have with this novel is that the characters, aside from Belle and Lavinia are rather under-developed, so that the reader has a hard time caring about those characters. I would liked to have seen the characters of Marshall and his parents better developed at the very least.<br /><br />Additionally, everyone in this story seems to have his or her own secret that must be closely guarded; never shared. Beginning with the master, and including everyone down to the lowliest slave. As the reader will see, these secrets lend an air of tragedy to the story, and still it seems that too many secrets tend to make the story a bit unbelievable.  The plot develops too slowly, not enough detail about some of the incidents. The ending feels abrupt and unresolved to me; which, in most cases, I do not consider an asset, hence taking off the full star.<br /><br />The novel's strong points (as I see them) are the evenly paced storyline, spreading out the suspense and the happy parts of the story without cramming all the good parts together and leaving part of the story boring. The novel was - to me - consistently, if not highly interesting. Character motivations play a large part in the plot of this novel and should be studied.<br /><br />Handled correctly, this great premise could have been a 5 star novel; yet sadly, there are too many flaws for that high rating. Despite the many flaws, I enjoyed reading this 4 star novel. Recommended to readers who do not demand flawless storytelling, and who like a bit of study with their reading pleasure. Those looking for a \\"light and fluffy\\" novel should pass this by.

0143118420|2.0|When a book seems to be forever at or near the top of the Time's best seller list, one expects it to at least be well written or exciting or unusually informative. I found Eat, Pray, Love to be none of the above. The writing is sometimes clever but it is never outstanding. The story itself, about a woman searching for her soul and for happiness, seems mundane, almost soap opera like. She is determined; anyone who spends the amount of time she does in an Ashram in rural India or studying with a medicine man in Bali has to be considered serious about her quest. I am sure she found it powerful and helpful; I did not. Her observations are simple and familiar. Her undertakings are rather common for soul-seekers, and her achievements which seem to do the job for her purposes were difficult to relate to.<br /><br />  I have also traveled far and wide but I have sought to broaden myself in the places she cites, not find myself. Her plight fits my picture of a depressed and devalued middle class woman. I am glad she found herself in a position to go on her search but I would surely have used those opportunities differently. There is an India outside of the Ashram, an Indonesia outside of Ubud and a world outside of Rome. She sure misses a lot. I think she needed a better travel guide. This is a rather mediocre and highly overrated piece of writing. I could not discern what accounts for its popularity except for the possibility that many folks can identify with her plight and enjoyed her pursuit of happiness vicariously.
0470913029|5.0|When you discuss dieting, in the end when all is said and done, you have to ask yourself - does it make sense? I like most of you have read dozens of books on dieting through the years. The result is that nothing has worked, the so called yo-yo effect. You lose and you gain it back. The idea of the Paleo Diet makes sense and other people have written of the effects of the actual diet on their lives.<br /><br />This book lays it all out for you, and the author Loren Cordain is one of the original researchers of the prehistoric lifestyle. The whole concept comes down to this. Human evolution goes back 5 million years. Genetic researchers tell us that tell us that there have been no genetic changes in human development in 40,000 years. What this means is that we could transport a new born baby born today, back 40,000 years and the child would grow up perfectly in tune with the environment. The reverse is true as well. So what we have to do is explore the diet that nature intended us to live by, and that is certainly not the one we are using today.<br /><br />More than 40,000 years ago the following did not exist:<br /><br />* Agriculture<br /><br />* Animal Husbandry<br /><br />* Technology<br /><br />* Processed Foods<br /><br />Yet our current economy is dominated by the above four concepts today. The result is that we are living on grains which agriculture provided us. The planting of seed and harvesting crops only started about 10,000 years ago. There was no dairy. Could you imagine the cave man milking a cow? Refined sugars did not exist or refined oils for that matter. As for processed foods, that is a 20th century happening. In the end it is our genes that determine our needs nutritionally, and we are not living in conformity with them. What it really comes down to is that we have Stone Age genetics living in Space age.<br /><br />Author Cordain quotes a study in which Eskimos in Greenland were studied. Now these are individuals who eat about 60% animal food. Most researchers would think they would die heavily from heart disease. During the ten year study which lasted from 1968 until 1978, not one Eskimo died from heart disease, heart attacks, or even had detectable heart disease. Here are the highest protein foods you can currently eat:<br /><br />1) Skinless turkey breast - 94% protein<br /><br />2) Shrimp - 90%<br /><br />3) Red Snapper - 87%<br /><br />4) Crab - 86%<br /><br />5) Halibut - 80%<br /><br />6) Steamed Clams - 73%<br /><br />7) Lean Pork tenderloin - 72%<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />What we are currently taking into our bodies is a nightmare for our biological systems. We are not eating enough protein. We are taking in too much of the wrong carbohydrates. There's not enough fiber, and too many of the bad fats. Carbs do not furnish fiber as most people think. Fruits possess two times the fiber of whole grains. As a society we need to move back to what we were originally intended to eat. The Paleo diet is the answer and this book is probably the best presentation of it. I thank you for reading this review.<br /><br />Richard C. Stoyeckly from heart disease.

Good luck and here are the author's best thoughts:<br /><br />* If your breakfast calories are composed of at least 30% protein, your resting metabolism will increase by 20%.<br /><br />* If you absolutely must have a snack, than go for carrots.<br /><br />* Instead of olive oil, try macadamia oil; it's new and improved.<br /><br />* Get rid of dairy<br /><br />* Take one day off per week from dieting - Dieters Gone Wild (DGW) day<br /><br />* Don't Drink Calories<br /><br />* Awareness even at a subconscious level beats fancy checklists without it.<br /><br />* The immense practicality of baby steps - take the pressure off<br /><br />* Post before and after pictures - use available websites to do this<br /><br />* Most people wish for an outcome but make no intention-driven actions toward that outcome.<br /><br />* Stop Wishing - Start Doing<br /><br />* Ten pounds of weight is roughly a clothing size. XL yields L yields M<br /><br />* It's not what you put in your mouth that matters. It's what makes it into your bloodstream. If it passes through, it doesn't count.<br /><br />* In fitness gyms, before they sell a product, they calculate profit first, and then work backward to justify the method.<br /><br />* Schedule your overeating<br /><br />* Recreation is for fun. Exercise is for producing change. Don't confuse the two.<br /><br />* A drug is a drug is a drug. Herbs can kill, supplements can kill, arsenic is all-natural, if it has an effect, it's a drug.<br /><br />* Avoid all methods with a high failure rate. An example is chopping vegetables and cleaning the Cuisinart three times a day.<br /><br />* When we do nothing as human beings, we burn 100 calories per hour just giving off heat.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />It is clear that Ferris is playing at a different level than his contemporaries. He has taken the time to master his profession. I urge anyone who is interested in sustaining his health, or losing weight to go through this book thoroughly, and adopt the appropriate practices. It will change your life. I thank you for reading this review.<br /><br />Richard C. Stoyeckll-natural, if it has an effect, it's a drug.    * Avoid all methods with a high failure rate.

1594202842|1.0|I did not realize the emotional and physical torture Chinese children are put through.  This woman feels she is a success while others are failures.  I don't consider a woman who would deny a 7 year old child, food, water and the use of the bathroom for hours on end over her not being able to master a very difficult piano piece, a success.  Something is off with this woman and her children certainly paid a heavy price.

B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I was blown away with how well done the wolves were in New Moon and thought they were never going to top that.  The effects were very well done as well as the acting was MUCH better in Eclipse.  The director and writers followed the book very closely, which was great.  I was only dissappointed with the \\"new\\" Victoria.  I liked the original Victoria in Twilight and New Moon better than the one chosen to play her in Eclipse.  She does the part well, but it just wasn't the same.  Definitely recommend the movie!
B0041T52S6|5.0|Every film I've seen by Edgar Wright: the first viewing I find it \\"okay to pretty good\\" then a few days go by and I start thinking about the film, it seems to percolate, and after awhile I want to see it again. Then I can't see it enough! Very few films hit me this way. I'm in my 40's and loved this movie. Maybe I'm arrested but I think Wright's movies are some of the most well written features of the last 6 Years!
B0041KKYEM|4.0|It's hard to know how many stars to give \\"Black Swan.\\" Three seems too low for a movie that held me riveted for its entire running time. Five seems too high for something so fundamentally over-the-top crazy. So I settled on four.     Natalie Portman, ideally cast, gives a forehead-vein-popping performance as Nina Sayres. Nina is a beautiful, obsessively driven, self-mutilating ballerina trying to get the Swan Queen lead in a production of Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake.\\" I used to think Portman was pretty but painfully dull. Here, she's horrifying and fascinating. Her long-necked, uber-thin body makes her a perfect physical fit. Every look, every word she speaks in her timorous little voice, every gesture, is a perfectly shattered reflection of her character's neuroses.     Nina has a warped, guilt-driven relationship with her single mother Erica (Barbara Hershey). Erica sacrificed her own dance career to raise Nina. Nina, at age 28, still lives with Erica in a pink cotton candy bedroom that appears not to have been redecorated since Nina was about 9. Erica breathes, lives and dies through Nina's successes and failures and never hesitates to let Nina know it. In one scene, Erica bakes Nina a birthday cake. Nina, always dieting, says she can't eat it. The ensuing explosion tells you all you need to know about Nina and her mother, but there are many more scenes like it.     The seductive French (what else?) director of Nina's ballet company tells Nina that she's a shoe-in for the virginal White Swan, but needs to explore her erotic side to play the Black Swan. Nina knows that at 28 she's getting on in years in the insanely competitive world of professional ballet, and this is a make-or-break part for her. She has never done anything but practice and live with her mother. The movie explores the madness that ensues when Nina pushes past her boundaries to embody the Black Swan.     The film has a simple color palette of black, white, red and pink, and low lighting that makes it appear to have been  photographed through a tarnished mirror. Mirrors and blood are the recurring visual motifs.     \\"Black Swan,\\" is a freak show. If you need further proof, Winona Ryder, of all people, is cast as the washed-up older ballerina Nina is replacing. Unless you're a better person than I, your morbid curiosity won't let you turn away. As is usually the case with freak shows, \\"Black Swan\\" fails to elicit any real empathy for any of its characters--pity is not the same thing as empathy--which is why it ends up being sickly hilarious. I expect to see it someday on the camp horror shelf alongside \\"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane\\" and \\"The Bad Seed.\\" If you like that sort of thing, and I have a sufficiently twisted sense of humor that I can really get into it, \\"Black Swan\\" is well worth your time.     Sufficiently erotic and gruesome that parents should see it themselves before deciding whether to let their children see it. I would not show it to a kid under 15 myself.
030746363X|5.0|A buddy of mine told me about this book because he is obsessed with The 4 Hour Work Week.  I read an exert from the book before it was released and immediately pre-ordered it.  The book arrived the day before a long flight and in the four hours on the plane I read over half of the book.  Since then I have read the weight-loss section about 5 times and the rest of the book twice.    Now this book is extreme and doesn't hold anything back.  Does everything in the book actually work?  I don't know.  I do know that the diet that is talked about in the beginning is working as I have lost nearly 10lbs in 20 days and am on track to lose 15 by day 30.  (The book said 20lbs in 30 days so I am stoked about that)    While I can't speak on other aspects of the book as I have not tried them out yet, I do know that what he said would happened has happened.  I cannot find a fault with the weight loss section.  It is truly a great book.
B0034G4P7G|2.0|I gave it 2 stars because it was interesting.  The movie is based on the founder of Facebook.  It spends ample time showing bar scenes and etc.  Its not terrible, but its not a movie you would want to watch with the kids because the characters use all the cuss words, including the F-bomb.  I would say it was worse than what I had anticipated.

0439023513|4.0|I've been reading some of the reviews on here and I see that Mockingjay is getting overwhelmingly bad reviews.  People are saying not to read it.  I think that if you liked and read the first 2, then read it.  I do have to say as a casual reader, I LOVED this series.  These are the best books I have read in a long time and have renewed my belief that books can continually be good, even in a series.  Catching Fire was my favorite of the series but I believe all three are great.  Mockingjay has a much different storyline then the last two in the trilogy.  Katniss is such a likeable character and I really liked the way Suzanne Collins finishes her character.  The ending wasnt fantastic, it was really quick and a lot to take in for only a few pages.  That being said, its what I wanted the ending to be and I was satisfied with it.  I'm really sad this series is over :(  If you liked the first two then why not read the Third, it may not be excellent but its still satisfying :)
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Ok let me tell you all something.... Richard Donner did his best with his Superman sequel so he can get you all experienced with his version and see how you all might've liked it. I thought this movie, except the ending, was really well done. Now if Donner would have left the ending without turning the world back in time just to get Lois to forget Clark's real identity, it would've been better that way. So I agreed with some of you saying the ending sucked cause it didn't make much sense and in that to me it didn't. Why would Superman spin the Earth back around just to make her forget of Superman's other identity? What's the point of that? I would've left it where Superman leaves Lois where she still remembers his secret and NOT turn world back in time, that's dumb and pointless. I'm sure Lois is good with secrets unless she's dumbfounded! Also that world back in time would mean the whole bully thing at the diner wouldn't have existed and that chef and the bully wouldn't have remembered who Clark was. And the three super-villains? Wouldn't they have come back to earth and start the whole fiascal all over again? That would mean trouble for Superman and Lois AGAIN! DUMB! Does this mean Richard Donner have to make Superman II 1/2 with different actors portraying the same characters cause of this whole travel back in time that made them free again? I SURE HOPE NOT! It probably would have been repetitive and stale. And I don't think it would've worked and that's my opinion. So I leave it to all of you to decide if that's appropriate or not. I only gave it four stars just because of the good story with a terrible ending.     Ok so all and all, the film was good but the ending could've been better IF he had a chance to complete the film with a possible different ending. Ok how about this ending, if Superman wanted to make Lois forget his real identity, how about if Superman bashed her brains into amnesia so then she can definitly forget his identity entirely! Ok that was alittle joke, I don't really think he's a monster to do such a thing anyways to hit any woman. It would've been evil and unlike him. Maybe if he got drunk, he might do it to her. Right?  How about if Lois gets into a car accident that puts her in a coma to make her forget his identity?! Wouldn't that have been a better ending? It's sure as hell is better than that world spinning back in time thing. I mean that's silly! Maybe if she got drunk while driving that causes her an accident behind the wheel! I think THAT would have been a better ending. Don't you think?     So RIchard Donner, YOU could have done that ending instead. I mean after all, humans do get into car accidents and Lois is definitly human, is she not?

It is a Myth, a Legend...When you watch it let yourself flow back into the mists of time. Watch  Arthur pull the sword from the stone. Do you wonder if Arthur knew what would happen once he unleashed the power of Excalibur.  I did and still do.

0312600844|1.0|I bought into the hype about this book - big mistake.  There are books that, once you reach the end, you are disappointed because you just don't want the story to end.  This book is the exact opposite of those.  I had to force myself to finish it.  From beginning to end, I couldn't possibly have cared less about any of the characters.  The story was so unbelievable in places that I actually found myself rolling my eyes.
0802473156|5.0|When it comes to love, I have never experienced true love because I was always selfish. I gave a little and wanted 100% in return or else. I didn't get a great lesson from my parents, nor my siblings, so I learned by trial and error. So this book is the my first easy to understand lesson on how to make it work with my current wife. I really do believe that if you apply your spouses primary love language while also practicing the other 4, your marriage will be fine. The key is to make an honest effort. If you can't make an effort, then counseling may help, or both the book and counseling. Try to look at the positive because there is always one person who will give a negative review, based on one paragraph in the book, rather than the entire book. I consider it a book for the repairing stage of marriage no matter how long you've been married. Obviously some marriages are beyond repairing so drastic measures must be taken. It really makes it easier for me because I can pinpoint one area and do the best I can in that area. Remember that I have to touch the other four languages as well. I hope this helps you in decision to buy the book, but I recommend this book as an engagement gift prior to marriage.

0316098337|1.0|I picked up this book after reading some of the great reviews.  I was extremely disappointed.  The story idea had great potential but was never developed into anything.  I found the story being told from the perspective of a five year old incredibly annoying and the repetitive fixation and references to his breast feeding very tedious. The escape was totally unbelievable.  The story really ends there as the remainder of the book just wanders and goes nowhere.
0525423273|5.0|During her senior year of high school, Anna Oliphant is sent to a boarding school in Paris. Being separated from her friends and having to make new ones in a city she's entirely unfamiliar with is not exactly how she thought she'd be spending her last year of high school. Sure, it may be Paris, but who would want to spend their final year with their friends away from their friends?    Anna cries during her first night in Paris. It's so loud, in fact, that she makes her first friend, a neighbor who is kind enough to check in on her. That's also when she meets Étienne St. Clair, the resident unavailable hottie, who has a glamorous girlfriend now in college. Every girl at SOAP (School of America in Paris) knows that Étienne, or St. Clair as he's more often called, is off-limits. And Anna has a maybe-sorta love interest of her own back home.     So the two have nothing to worry about, right?    If it's not love at first sight, Anna and Étienne's relationship starts off in a much more sincere way: as friends. Friends who, despite any growing attraction they might have to one another, laugh together, see movies, argue --- in short, they learn to speak the other's language. There are inside jokes, moments that will have you bawling because of the pure funny, and, of course, times when you just want to throw up your hands and say, \\"Kiss already!\\"    But they won't, because Anna does what she can to be the best friend she can be to Étienne, at a time when he needs a friend more than another romance. Anna is an incredibly smart and likable, quirky character, with a voice I found myself enjoying at every turn. She is fully drawn, down to her singular stripe of bleached blond hair. And that's not to say she's perfect. No --- these characters are flawed in ways that we all are flawed. Even Étienne, who I found myself completely charmed by, isn't perfect. Thanks to an extremely overbearing (and that's an understatement) father who keeps him on a tight leash, Étienne is averse to change --- even when a situation may call for it. It's a flaw that is believable and forgivable enough that you'll still be rooting for him in the end.    Stephanie Perkins has woven something much more than just a romance here; it's a story of friendship and yet also a story of independence, all the while deftly attending to the characters' individual problems at home and school. ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS succeeds on all accounts. When I put the book down after reading it, I was, quite frankly, left giddy. And then I wanted to read it all over again.        --- Reviewed by Jordana Frankel

B003EI2EH2|5.0|The book is fun to read and is more a story of the author and experiments with himself as the guinea pig. The reader is encouraged to experiment in order to find out what works. Caution is suggested along with numerous tests and a suggestion to contact your doctor. The advice to check with your doctor should be followed. As a diet book there are two programs. The first is a weight loss program.The second is a weight gain program. Both programs recommend supplements that can be very expensive. These supplements are used to accelerate weight loss. In following the diet I did drink green tea and took the garlic supplement. This was all that was needed to lose weight.The program promises rapid weight loss. The supplements are used to accelerate weight loss. However, my goal was two pounds per week. Faster weight loss is not recommended by most medical professionals.   The diet excludes fruit except once a week. This diet requires supplements as it is not truly a balanced diet. The recommended supplement dosages exceeds what is recommended on the label. Use caution when exceeding recommended dosages. Some of these supplements are blood thinners. Others are healthy fats.  My choice was not to exceed the dosage recommended on the labels of any supplements.The weight gain program uses supplements meant to increase muscle mass. I   primarily did the weight loss diet and it worked we where I had hit the wall using other diets. Adding weight training twice a week increased muscle mass and I was able to start losing weight again. Kettlebell  swings were the only exercise I performed but these worked to restart my weight loss. Althought I did do 40 air squats before and after each meal. Care is needed with Kettle Bell Swings  and it easy to injure your self. So use proper form. I   am doing the diet in six week intervals. With one month off after each six weeks. It requires work to find all the tips that really make the diet work.  Follow the section that explains why the diet might not be working very closely. The information on great sex could have been left out. But then the tip about not carrying your cell phone next to your jewels would not have   been included. The cold showers really helped along with the ice pack on the neck. Forget the ice baths. They just are stupid. Hyperthermia any one? Still a great book! Well worth the price on Amazon. This program does work! But required I use all of the tips on how to guarantee weight loss.
030746363X|5.0|This book is much better than typical diet/weight loss, self-improvement, etc. books.  For one, it includes all of that into one book. Second, it cuts through all the bull. It's easy to implement his tactics and receive results fast.  In other books, they over complicate topics to the point where they are very difficult to stick with.  Tim Ferriss allows you to get 80% of the results with less than 8% of the work.  It's easy to maintain his programs because the results happen so fast, they serve as a better motivator than just about anything else could.  Lastly, he provides all the necessary information in an easy-to-read and enjoyable format, not an easy task for this category.  It is rare to find a book that is both effective and enjoyable to read.  All in all, I highly recommend this book.  Just try it and you'll be amazed at what a few small changes can do for your body.
B0041KKYEW|4.0|\\"Black Swan\\" is an amazing cinematic experience, if not a particularly original one.  In this compelling film, director Aronofsky successfully weds his trademark gritty realism with themes, characters, and visual motifs originally manifested in the classic works of directors such as Clouzot, Hitchcock, Polanski . . . and especially Brian DePalma, master of the explicit 1970s psycho-sexual thriller.  Of course, \\"Black Swan\\" is clearly an homage to these filmmakers and their works, so half the fun of the film lies in identifying its numerous allusions (\\"Diabolique,\\" \\"Frenzy,\\" \\"The Tenant,\\" \\"Dressed to Kill,\\" etc.).  Beyond its inspirations, however, the film is brilliantly written, shot, scored, and acted--and ultimately, it melds its fantastic visceral content with thought-provoking ruminations on the nature of obsession and art.  Great flick.

B0046MOVD0|2.0|Another Resident Evil movie, just what we need.  And wouldn't you know it, but writer/producer and director of the first film Paul W.S. Anderson has returned to the director's chair to continue Alice's (Milla Jovovich) quest against the Umbrella Corporation, amid armies of zombies, evil beasts, and other assorted nasties.  The proceedings are pretty predictable, with Ali Larter returning as well as Claire Redfield, and her brother Chris finally makes his film debut, played by Prison Break's Wentworth Miller.  Utilizing top notch 3-D technology, Anderson fills the film with so many slow-motion effects and bullet time moments that you'll find yourself falling asleep.  Why is that you ask?  Because we've all seen this done so many times before, and we've seen it done much better as well.  As a whole, Resident Evil: Afterlife is actually kind of boring, which is really disappointing considering that the previous film, Resident Evil: Extinction, was a surprisingly good installment of this otherwise stale series.  Still, the ending offers some intriguing promise for the futre, so we shall see what comes next, whether we want to or not.

B0040UEI7C|4.0|Aida is one of those operas that has been very lucky in the recording studio, as there are several great recordings available (some operas, like La traviata, never seem to get a definitive reading on record). This recording, intelligently and idiomatically conducted by Riccardo Muti, is one of the strong contenders. The sound is crisp and deep and the soloist and the orchestra are well-balanced. The cast consists of 5 of the biggest operatic stars of the 70s. Montserrat Caballé sings Aida with beautifully, even if she won't make you forget Leontyne Price, Zinka Milanov or Renata Tebaldi.  Caballé's voice lacks the true spinto-weight of those singers, but there is plenty a drama in her vocal acting and her famous pianissimi are put to great use in \\"O patria mia\\". Placido Domingo is a heroic Radames, whose vocal character suggests an ardent lover as well as a powerful commander. The competition in this difficult tenor role is great though, and Domingo's singing can't match the beauty of Jussi Björling, the sheer power of Franco Corelli, or the elegance and colouring the Carlo Bergonzi on other sets. Fiorenza Cossotto, who play Amneris, need not fear competition, though. Her italianate mezzo has all the bite and jealous venom to make Amneris come alive. Piero Cappuccilli sings Aida's father Amonasro with secure, idiomatic tone but doesn't make much of the role dramatically. Nicolai Ghiaurov is a rich-voiced, authoritive Ramfis. So, is this the recording to get? Like I said there are many great versions, Including Solti's with Price and Jon Vickers, which maybe more intersting and dramatic, Karajan's recording with the most idiomatic trio of soloists in Tebaldi, Bergonzi and Simionato, Perlea's with the golden pairing of Björling and Milanov and Toscanini's wonderful live recording with Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker, not to forget Maria Callas's potrayal under the baton of Tullio Serafin.
B0043RT8JU|5.0|This was the first John Green novel that I have read and I loved it! I thought it was creative and serious at the same time. As someone else mentioned, Green doesn't feel the need to talk down to you, but rather encourages you to think about the subjects he introduces. He was really great at balancing the serious aspects of the book with humor (my favorite part was when they buy Radar a confederate flag shirt on their road trip). I also found the idea of paper towns really interesting and I hadn't ever heard about them before. Right after I finished reading this I bought two more of John Green's books, paper towns was so amazing. One other thing I loved was that the main character was a guy, even though I'm a girl it seems like all YA books have girls as protagonists and this was a refreshing change of pace.

B0006GAOBI|4.0|This includes only the director's cut, not both the standard and director's cuts. I assumed it included both. What's the problem? The music is different on many scenes. It's still an excellent movie though.
B000O5B4C4|5.0|Sure, there's Psycho but I am also adding the HOT FACTOR; this movie for me was the the best thriller I have ever seen and really the best movie are atleast on my top five with Thelma & Louise, Rosemary's Baby, Last Tango in Paris & Butterflies are Free.   Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas were dead on; extremely believable characters and even after it was all over my sister had to explain to me that of course Katherine Tremell was the killer because of the icepick under the best.  Then I rewatched and understood the whole way the other woman was set up by Catherine and the brilliance of it all tying into her bestselling novel.  The movie was thrilling!  And Sharon Stone never looked hotter or any woman for that matter than Catherine in this film.  Michael Douglas was great as the quesionable cop; likable but with an edge and a dark side.  Catherine Tremell was the DARK SIDE period. I'd give it ten stars if I could!!
0525951652|4.0|Fans (and new fans) of Ken Follett, the Fall of Giants is everything you can expect from this wonderfully entertaining writer! Beware a previously featured review by a critic who has obviously read not one, but two of the trilogy because he discloses details that I was looking forward to learning for myself when I purchased the second in the series. Fall of Giants ends with a variety of heros and heroines torn apart by war and some, particularly a young russian immigrant to the U.S., not even entered into the legendary first conflict of the century. Ken Follett's talents have always resided in his sensitive appreciation of the details of everyday people's lives and personalities. Moments of courage and weakness in the face of overwhelming accidents of time are what he is a master in revealing. Do I care that sometimes coincidences between his people take place a little too conveniently? No, of course not. I read Mr. Follett because he is yet another author that reminds me to believe in the preciousness of our human experience. That in his many stories I am served up a refresher course in history which often causes me to run to my computer or encyclopedia to flesh out more details, only underlines how fortunate I am that this prolific writer is still in the game. The only down side to this latest offering is that the author makes a bow to the ever-ravenous desire of modern readers to have graphic and lengthy sex scenes when they occur. Most are just fine, but a few are overkill. All in all, a great read.

0385341679|5.0|What a ride the Fever series has been. I am sad that SHADOWFEVER was the last book but I was blown away and couldn't have asked for a better last book. Everything you have been questioning or wondering about will be answered and I'm telling you you will have never guessed the things that are revealed. I am on information overload with all the revelations. I couldn't read this fast enough. I was so mad at the book in the first part but I slowly made my way back as I was reading on. I dont think I have never read about more stubborn characters in a series then what the characters were like in SHADOWFEVER, I wanted to jump in the book and smack them across the head. I dont want to list any spoilers so I will leave off saying WOW what a ride!! If you haven't picked uo and started reading the Fever series you are missing out on a fabulous series, I think I might have to start over and read the books again to see what clues I might have missed.
B002N8A14M|1.0|Overall this product looks good and would have probably worked good the only problem is that the ipod goes inside the hard plastic case so it is impossible for me to plug my headphones in.  My headphones wont click all the way in due to the case so its pretty much useless so be warned unless you have a skinny 3.5mm headphone jack its not going to stick in.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Where has this been my whole life, and why has no one told me about it?! I now have SHARP cutting blades on just about everything in my house...even a few things ( a letter opener, etc.) that probably shouldn't!  The carbide shaping edge- oh yeah, it works! You can see the metal shavings all but falling off the blade! The porcelain sharpener- works great too! It makes a very smooth, sharp, quick edge out of all, or what, you have just shaped or carved off your blade! The hand-held design is great! I have not used the serrated edge sharpener yet, but if it performs half as well as the rest of the item, it's still a 5 star purchase! I now have 1 in my home, office and hobby areas! Enjoy, it's worth it!!!
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|I'll keep this short since everyone is probably in a hurry to check their facebook statuses. After all they hype this movie got I decided to buy it on blu ray. Well me and my girlfriend sat down and watched the movie. The first thing that bothered me was the character of Mark Zuckerburg. His character is a know-it-all annoying character that most of us avoid in real life. I've never met Mr. Zuckerburg but if he is anything like the movie portrayed him, he is arrogant and frankly uninteresting. I cared little for him through out the whole movie and was waiting for him to get his come-up-ins.<br /><br />  After the movie was over I was a little confused as to why this movie was hailed by some as \\" The defining movie of this generation\\" god we are in so much trouble if that is true... I ended up reading something in a newspaper about how the movie made up the story about how Mark started to create facebook. I guess making a movie about guys who sat around their dorms and ate pizza while they talked about girls would be pretty boring.<br /><br /> The Social Network is not a bad movie, its just a very average one. It tries so hard to be this epic story of betrayal and greed when in reality the movie had very little impact or lasting impression on myself. On a different note, the acting is pretty top notch. I mean, who would have thought that Justin Timberlake would be a good actor. So it may be a decent movie, and I may have been hard on it only cause it got so much attention and praise, but for me this movie was a rent, not worth a purchase.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I usually run from very long thick books fortunately with the Kindle I can't easily tell how long they are. Happily \\"World with End\\", despite it's length, is a completely enjoyable read. A fictional view of Kingsbridge 200 years after Follett's \\"Pillars\\" in an era that includes the beginning of The Hundred Year War and The Black Death. As with \\"Pillars\\" there is a lot of very interesting medieval architectural detail. The characters are all well drawn out and the plot interesting enough that I had trouble putting it down at times. Easily recommended.

My friend from back home gave me the book to read on the train. I could not but this book down. Its filled with adventure, mystery, and little romance (but it is not super cheesy). I finished it in 2 days. I'm currently on the 3rd book.. hopefully I finish it soon because its making me late for work (it is because I so badly want to know what is going to happen!)
B000JK8OYU|5.0|First thing is of course this is not like listening to the songs as they were made originally. However, since there can't be any new Beatles albums, this is a way for it to be fresh. The way the songs move into one another and mash together makes for a fun listening experience. You get to hear hits mixed with other hits mixed with lesser known songs. It's like hearing The Beatles for the first time all over again.    It makes a great companion for your Beatles collection, I would love for another version with some of their other songs mashed and blended together that are not on here. You won't regret buying it, and it makes the perfect gift for any Beatles or Cirque fan.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Lee Unkrich's \\"Toy Story 3\\" plays a little like an expanded version of \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\" crossed with Rankin/Bass' \\"Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer\\"  - with a bit of \\"Stalag 17\\" and \\"The Great Escape\\" thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />It's eleven years since we last checked in on Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie and all the other occupants of little Andy's toy box.  Only little Andy ain't so little anymore, and as he embarks on a new life in college, his once-beloved companions fret over what is to become of them now that they'll no longer be getting the kind of attention and affection all toys need to be happy (actually they haven`t been getting much play time at all for the past few years of Andy`s adolescence).  Woody insists that they must stay loyal to Andy, but the others fear it may be time to move on to friendlier, more kid-centric territory or face an ignominious end, thrown to the curb so some giant garbage truck can scoop them up and mash them into plastic pulp.  Instead, through a series of crazy misunderstandings, they all wind up in the local daycare-center-from-hell (sort of a more sinister version of the Island of Misfit Toys), where they are placed at the mercy of both a band of overexcited toddlers and a bunch of sadistic playthings who rule the place with an iron fist.  Only Woody manages to escape their evil clutches and, like the true cowboy hero of old, he comes up with a plan to rescue his desperate compadres from this virtual armed camp, ironically named Sunnyside.<br /><br />It seems redundant at this point to keep heaping praise on these Pixar productions, so let me just say that \\"Toy Story 3\\" is a true crowd-pleasing delight, a witty, endlessly inventive, and visually stunning animated movie that works equally well for youngsters who are still playing with their toys and old folks who might well become inspired to head up to that old attic and dust off some long-forgotten buddies of their own.  The voice work by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, et.al., brings each and every one of these charmingly diverse and beautifully differentiated characters to vivid life.  We're so familiar with them ourselves at this point that they almost feel like they came out of OUR toy boxes.  It's also fun watching the movie make villains out of some seemingly innocuous, even cuddly, toys like the embittered, strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the joint and a diaper-clad baby doll that serves as his loyal henchman.<br /><br />In addition to high comedy, Michael Arndt`s script provides a careful balance of breath-bating suspense and heartbreaking sentiment (believe me, there won't be a dry eye in the house at the end), as it explores the universal themes of camaraderie, friendship and the importance of working together in a common cause.<br /><br />Whether young or old, 2-D or 3-D, at \\"Toy Story 3,\\" everyone can be a kid again., Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, et.al., brings each and every one of these charmingly diverse and beautifully differentiated characters to vivid life.

B004HAG40O|4.0|the king is dead is different from the line of great albums the Decemberists have but not in a bad way. they traded there folk/Americana sound for a little more upbeat country sounding tune. a lot more emphasis on the violin and harmonica which sounds great but is defiantly a change of pace for them. there are a few songs that did go back to there roots but the majority of there album is new sound.<br />the king is dead is a great album and will get new listeners to the band but its almost to different for fans of their very distinctive sound. ill have to say i like it but i don't love it.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I've been a fan of Bruce Willis for some time now. From his first major appearance on MOONLIGHTING through the DIE HARD films, I've made a point to see his films when they are released. When I heard that he was starring in RED, based on the comic book of the same name, I was anxious to see how it turned out. And while it plays loose with the source material, it ends up being one of my favorite films from last year.<br /><br />The story revolves around Frank Moses (Willis), a retired \\"Agency\\" assassin living a boring life that has become far too routine for him. To pass the time he calls Sarah Ross (Mary Louise Parker), the woman who handles payments to retired employees of a company she only knows as legit with no clue as to his past. Each month he calls to tell her the check didn't arrive, even though it did, and the two have a conversation. Both are bored and lonely and strike up a phone friendship.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Frank the \\"Agency\\" monitors all of its ex-employees designated RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) and don't take kindly to them making consistent phone calls. Rather than assume nothing despicable is going on, they're more prone to think secrets are being leaked or some other nefarious plot is in the works. So they send a strike team to take out Frank one night. But as his designated retirement status claims, Frank is not someone you should mess with. The team is taken out and Frank is on the run.<br /><br />His first stop is to find Sarah who he realizes he has accidentally placed in danger. Rescuing her and with her still not quite ready to believe his story, they head out to find other members of his old team. Like conspiracy minded Marvin Boggs who thinks everyone is out to get him played fantastically by John Malkovich. Then Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) who welcomes the chance to escape his retirement home for some action like the old days. And finally there is Victoria (Helen Mirren), set up in peaceful tranquility...with the exception of taking on the occasional assassination.<br /><br />Brought back together by circumstances the team is on the move to find out who it was that authorized the hit and why. On their tail is \\"Agency\\" man William Cooper (Karl Urban), a top notch agent who could be Frank's match. If it wasn't for the fact that Frank taught Cooper's trainer everything he knew...but not all that Frank knew.<br /><br />Crosses and double crosses flow throughout the story as the team follows one lead to another in an attempt to find out just who is behind the uproar. Everyone from a weapons manufacturer (Richard Dreyfuss) to the Vice President become suspects but it isn't until the final moments that we discover just who the culprit is.<br /><br />Along the way there are plenty of explosions, jokes and hand to hand combat moments that should keep Willis and action fans sitting on the edge of their seats. By the last reel you'll find yourself wishing that the movie hadn't ended and that another was on the way. Thank goodness the rumor mill has it that their planning a sequel.<br /><br />The action is non-stop, the effects are top notch and the acting is some of the best I've seen. To me the best acting doesn't involve the ability to simply say your lines in the most dramatic way possible. Instead, the best acting is when you completely forget the fact that you're watching a movie, that the person performing is an actor and you totally believe that for two hours they ARE that person. Such are the performances by all involved here.<br /><br />But best of all with this movie is the fact that for 111 minutes you are entertained. And in the long run isn't that what it's all about? No, this film will not find most involved nominated for any Oscars but the truth is that some of the most entertaining films made never do. Instead they find fans who watch the film over and over again. This is one of those movies, a film that I for one feel I could watch more than three times and never be bored with. And that makes it a movie worth watching.
1582403589|5.0|I loved it. I watched AMC's \\"The Walking Dead\\" and loved that as well.    I think he really captures the character aspect of this kind of situation, and that's what I really love about this genre.

If you need to edit the battlefield as you go, this is for you.Can fold up for easy transport, but it's best stored flat so it's easy to get it to lie flat when you do use it.  Set some books on the intersecting creases in the center to get it to lie down.

B0034G4P7G|5.0|Critics around the world have hailed THE SOCIAL NETWORK as the best film of the year. It won the Golden Globe for best picture, director, score, screenplay, actor and supporting actor and has been nominated for best picture at the Oscars. So is it really a good movie? Fortunately the answer is yes.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a computer geek at Harvard with practically no skills whatsoever when it comes to interacting with actual people. Dumped by his girlfriend as the movie opens, he returns to his dorm room, drinks heavily and begins blogging about her in the worst way possible. At the same time he hacks into various dorm data banks for pictures of girls across campus and then with a little help from his friends creates a web site that offers people the chance to rate each one against another. One can only imagine how well THAT goes over.<br /><br />Chastised by the administration, Mark is then sought out by a prestigious pair of twin students, the Winklevoss brothers, in the hopes that he will assist then in creating an information site that will provide personal information between students at Harvard. He accepts but places their needs on the back burner while working on his own site, The Facebook. Unfortunately the whole idea behind The Facebook is similar to what they've asked him to create.<br /><br />Using none of the computer code they used on their site, Mark creates Facebook and it becomes popular with the student at Harvard. With the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), he gets the financing to make the site even bigger. But as it grows so do the problems that come with something this big.<br /><br />Mark views the world differently than most. His inability to communicate with people on a one to one basis is less about his not caring and more about the fact that he is more comfortable with writing code than having a simple date. And while he may be a genius when it comes to computers, his desire for a higher social status interferes with many of the decisions he makes throughout the film.<br /><br />As the site becomes more popular, Mark and Eduardo expand their horizons making it available to universities other than Harvard. This of course doesn't set well with the Winklevoss brothers. But more problems are on the horizon as Eduardo insists that they begin posting ads on the site to create a flow of income. For Mark the site has nothing to do with making money. It's about the creation of the site and his being able to take credit for it, to elevate his status on both the campus and in the world.<br /><br />As the site expands to Stanford, it draws the attention of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the creator of Napster, who has a nose for business as well as trouble. He entices Mark to take the site over the top and make it the biggest most profitable web site around. As Eduardo attempts to gain funds via advertising and more in New York, Parker involves himself with Mark and gets funding set up in California. The rivalry between the two over the fortunes derived from Mark's creation is a parallel storyline as both Eduardo and the Winklevoss brothers are both suing Mark for millions.<br /><br />A film about computer geeks that's interesting? No action, no explosions, gunplay involved? The answer is yes, the film is quite interesting and yes it does offer one of the best stories told on screen. The wordplay is fast and furious and Aaron Sorkin deserves every nomination he receives.<br /><br />The acting is once more top notch with you feeling as if everyone involved truly is their character. Eisenberg is a master at fast paced conversation in every film I've seen him in and he takes it to a whole new level here. Even Timberlake, who many would want to toss off as just a boy band singer, does a great job here as a character who is both charming and slithery at the same time.<br /><br />Most of us online know that Facebook exists and many of us useit. But my belief is that few know the story behind its creation or the turmoil that came between friends over its success. As with most movies my guess is that there is a certain amount of one sided story being told here but it still offers one hell of a story.the turmoil that came between friends over its success. As with most movies my guess is that there is a certain amount of one sided story being told here but it still offers one hell of a story.

B003Q6D27S|3.0|3-D has taken the theaters by storm this past year. So much so that everything but the kitchen sink has been tossed at audiences (and I'm not certain that even that hasn't been thrown). Greek Gods to zombies have found there way to the format so is it any wonder that a horror series jumped on board? SAW 3D THE FINAL CHAPTER supplies that need.<br /><br />Fans of the film series have loved every gruesome, gory scene offered. But now they had the chance to witness it in 3D in theaters. But with the movie being released on DVD in regular 2D format is it a good movie? Without the comin' at ya type effects, is it any good? The answer is yes and no.<br /><br />If you've been following the series at all you know that the film began with 2 people chained in a run down old subway type bathroom being provided knowledge of how they had wronged people and given a chance to make a choice, one that would involve some great pain or damage, but that would give them the chance to make write their wrongs.<br /><br />The series continued in this vein with the main character of Jigsaw, the culprit who was behind the dangerous torture fueled traps that held each person captive, who in reality was John Kramer (Tobin Bell). It seems that John was diagnosed with an inoperable condition and then treated poorly by everyone from insurance agents to police. With nothing to lose, he set out to help people change their lives, giving them an opportunity to become valued members of society or perish in the process. Talk about tough love.<br /><br />By the time this film opens, John's last assistant has gone on a rampage and disgraced the original intent that John began with. Sure it was crazy, but Det. Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) has taken it into a whole different direction. As seen in the last film, rather than truly offering people a chance to change, he's set out on making the traps inescapable. Instead of a chance it is now out and out murder.<br /><br />It appeared that he was facing death at the hands of John's wife (Betsy Russell) in the last film, but he escaped and is now searching for her as well as setting up a whole new game for Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flannery). It seems that Dagen claimed to be on of Jigsaw's victims, profiting from writing a book about his experience and going on to creating self help groups for other victims as well as a DVD of their meetings.<br /><br />Now Bobby must face Jigsaw for real in the form of Hoffman. And with each new trap we are witness to another form of torture that has the potential to end gruesomely and with much blood spilled. While not quite out and out torture porn, as this genre has been named, the film does have the viewer bear witness to some truly gut wrenching deaths. Perhaps not if you've seen the other films, but anyone just now jumping on may turn their head more often than once.<br /><br />As Hoffman pursues John's wife and sets in motion Bobby's trial by fire, the police are hot on his trail. Tracking him through the clues left behind, they narrow it down. But will the get there in time to prevent another death forever linked to Jigsaw?<br /><br />One thing the movie does offer is the chance for it to truly end. And the surprise ending here was one that caught me off guard and was actually quite satisfying. But it did offer the slightest chance for the series to continue. One can only hope that the makers of this series let it go out on a high note rather than milk it for one last dollar. I mean does anyone really feel the need to pull out JASON GOES TO MANHATTAN? Six films in a series that has only one (in my opinion) truly bad film is something to take pride in.<br /><br />So if you're a fan you'll love this one. If you've come and gone, you'll get a decent solution to the story. The lose ends are tied up nicely by the last minute. The series has a beginning, middle and an end. And the ending offered is satisfactory.sell) in the last film, but he escaped and is now searching for her as well as setting up a whole new game for Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flannery).

It's better than a majority of novels I've read, only because the information goes against everything I previously believed about fitness and \\"healthy eating.\\" It changed the way I think about the way food affects my body, and how the smallest changes can make a huge difference. But don't get me wrong, this book is not just a bunch of cool information, but a total life transforming guide.

My 9 yr old is now into listening to older classic songs by David Bowie because of this movie.  She will be 10 in February so I decided the Blu-ray version would be one of her gifts.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm the type that can always find something 'just not right' with television, film and books, but where 'The Walking Dead' is concerned, I can find NOTHING. This show has broken records, was renewed for a second season long before the first season was over and will continue to captivate viewers as long as it stays on the air (if the 1-year-long wait for Season Two doesn't tick too many fans off and send them packing). Now let me tell you why...<br /><br />The Cast -<br /><br />Nothing bugs me more than how television and even film tend to think that getting the hottest, clone-like, most high-profile actors is a necessity. While the cast of The Walking Dead are not by any means unattractive, they are real, relatable, everyday-looking human beings like your next door neighbor, or that guy that works as a mechanic at Jiffy Lube. Fans can easily relate to every character on this show in some way and not be distracted by the Hollywood 'expectations', which so many television shows and movies live by. Look at the cast of films such as The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and yes, even Twilight (dare I say it!)! Many of these actors were extremely low-profile, or in the case of Harry Potter, practically nobody. Now imagine if Steven Spielberg landed the Harry Potter director's job and cast Haley Joel Osment as Harry, or if Sean Connery accepted the role of Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings. Do I really need to say it? I didn't think so. So yes, characters matter. They matter A LOT, and if you want a kick a*s television show or film, then choose the cast based on character, not on fame and sex appeal.<br /><br />The Location -<br /><br />Face it, a good majority of all television and film is not only shot in New York, Chicago and other huge cities as such, but base their story lines in those places as well. There ARE other people and places in the United States, y'know! If The Walking Dead was shot in Chicago instead of Atlanta, I would've been ticked off, needless to say. But like with casting characters that so many average people can relate to, the storyline taking place primarily in a city OTHER THAN the `Hollywood cities', is just as important.<br /><br />The Storyline -<br /><br />In addition to all of the excellent reviews and comments by fans out there, I've also run across quite a few haters (can't be successful without haters!) who have griped and complained about this and that and blah, blah, blah. Basically, the majority of negative comments I have seen seem to revolve around one thing: PREDICTABILITY. These are people who expected Dr. Jenner to know every single thing about this `virus' and give it all up in episode 6, and about other things that did not happen, but they pretty much thought would. The Walking Dead storyline isn't entirely PREDICTABLE! Really? And that's a bad thing how? Personally, I was extremely happy that episode 6 went out the way it did and that the characters didn't go into the CDC and leave with the knowledge that would obviously send them out to find the cure, which is a plant that only grows on ledges under waterfalls. I want to be surprised when I watch something new and The Walking Dead has definitely delivered UNpredictably!<br /><br />It's NOT About Police Investigations or Emergency Rooms-<br /><br />CSI, Chase, CSI, NCIS, CSI, CSI - Really...when is enough, enough? The Walking Dead comes out and is a godsend to television riddled with cop and doctor shows, not to mention, fake reality TV.<br /><br />Kick-a*s, Gruesome ZOMBIES -<br /><br />No need to explain this; watch the show and it speaks for itself.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is my favorite show E.V.E.R - just can't beat it.

0316078913|2.0|Having read all of David Sedaris' books and having loved them, I was glad to drop $10 on this small new book.  The only problem is that the stories are not new.  Nowhere does it say this on the book cover.  You have to turn to page 4 to see that almost every story appeared in another major publication that I already have.  I could have just re-read the books I already have.  This is the last David Sedaris book I will buy.  Write some new stories!
0810997827|5.0|I was a very avid reader by the time I was 9 and I tried tirelessly to get my 9 year to pick up a book to no avail, for him  reading was a punishment.  Then I got him \\"Diary of a wimpy kid\\"  series for X-mas, he finished all four books in less than a month!  Now in January I got him the last one for his birthday and three other books, and we have to tell him again and again to put the books down and do his stuff.  Thank you Mr. Kinney, you made my son love books!
0399215921|2.0|I was disappointed that this book is so small.  It has double-ply pages, making it sturdy for little hands, but it is so tiny!  Maybe it will be a good book for travel.
B0040LLLMQ|2.0|Haven't bought this season yet.  I'm wondering what on earth makes this collector's edition $100 more than the non-collectors edition?  Sure it has 1 extra disc, but is it gold plated???  I'll wait until the price is lower.  I'm just not ready to spend this much, even though I really enjoyed the series and have all the previous seasons.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|A movie for the 21st century. A novel topic, cleverly excecuted. First rate special effects, with an intelligent storyline. It certainly does not fit the Hollywood gung-ho, bust-them-to-a-million-pieces stereotype rubbish so it won't suit those with those kinds of expectations. But it will certainly suit the majority of us who expect more from our movies. This Canadian production hits the spot! 5 stars!!![[ASIN:B003EYVXSW Splice]]
B001N44BVQ|4.0|`Body of Lies' is a political thriller set during the Iraq war and with some solid performances from both Di Caprio and Crowe. Following a CIA operative in the middle east who is trying to track down a terrorist this film has enough twists and turns to keep you interested, but not so many that you are left confused and asking too many questions as you go through. This film is very well directed by Ridley Scott and is also very well written; it makes certain points about the Iraq war without ramming them down your throat, which is rare from Hollywood and infinitely preferable to being spoon-fed. There are explosions enough for action fans, espionage and intrigue for thriller fans, political machinations for the more machiavellian and some romance for the softer side in us. All in all a good balance. This film tries to show Americas superior technology and ability to watch who it wants, when it wants, but that may just be good film propaganda and beneficial to the storyline. I tend to take it with a pinch of salt at least. Overall this was a good, but not great, political/spy thriller and the performance from Leonardo alone makes it worth watching. Check it out.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This movie is so amazing! It is a fun twist on a classic tale. Disney did it again with fun songs, great characters, and a spectacular plot. This is definitely one of my favorite Disney movies.
B0010HOZS0|3.0|`Invasion' is a modern take on `Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and sadly for me ended up being a huge disappointment. This is all the more so because I was on the edge of my seat and filled with the right amounts of tension the whole way through, only to be left aghast at the weak and `cop-out' ending that fizzled out without any impact. Following Nicole Kidman (who acts remarkably well in this film) and her family as they deal with the impact of an alien invasion that leaves the populations as hosts to the alien parasites, this film has excellent apocalyptic themes. You are nervous whenever she encounters an afflicted person and flinch every time she nearly gets infected and this never lets up for the duration. The story is well written and you are gripped the whole way through and then the end arrives and you are left angry and disappointed wondering what happened. At 90 minutes this isn't that long and they could have easily added an extra 15 minutes to tie things up more neatly. The effects are pretty good, everyone acts well and the direction is good as well. Overall this would get 4/5 stars for the first 80 minutes and then 1/2 for the last 10 minutes. Such a shame, but worth a look never the less.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|`Death Magnetic' is Metallica's follow up to the much maligned and abused `St Anger' and compared to that album this is a vast improvement. With a solid producer at the helm (the legendary Rick Rubin) the sound is immediately much clearer and suit's the band's style more and the songs seem to better formed and more focused. This album reminded me in places of a cross between `Kill Em All' and `Load', that is to say a blend of the old and modern sound, which is no bad thing really. The main problem with this album is Metallica's tendency to equate length of song with quality. Each song is pretty good but, like on previous albums, they should really end them after four minutes or so; to make each song `epic' and overblown detracts from the music on offer. I tend to feel they should give the whole `Unforgiven' theme a rest as well now. `The Unforgiven 3' is ok, but nowhere near as good as the original and the more they churn out these sequel tracks, the more it will take away from the impact of the original. Overall though this is a solid album that definitely gets better with repeated listening and is a huge improvement over the last outing, lets just hope by the next album they are fully on track and back up to speed. Good, but not yet great again.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B001FB55I0|5.0|I love this movie, It is intense and very action packed. I seen it in theaters and I loved every minute of it.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|`Big Bang Theory Series 2' carries on where series 1 left off, with many hilarious geek jokes and great performances from this comedy cast. This has all the episodes from the series across four discs, as well as extras including a bloopers reel and a short documentary. The various episodes are as humorous as the first series and my personal favourite has to be the one where Leonard's mother comes to visit; to see her interaction with Sheldon is nothing short of genius and makes for twenty minutes of exquisite TV. Wolowitz is as funny as ever trying to find love (be it in it's physical or relationship form) and the lines he comes out with will make you both burst out laughing and cringe. Penny and Sheldon's relationship develops as well and the episode where they buy Christmas presents for each other is especially good and touching. You also get the tension between Penny and Leonard and whilst their love never quite blossoms, they do develop a deeper friendship over the series. I still maintain that Sheldon is the funniest character but to be honest they all manage to raise a laugh at regular intervals. The series finale is especially good and I can't wait to see how it will pick up in series 3, fingers crossed it comes this way soon! All in all if you liked the first series then it is a safe bet you will enjoy this as well. It manages to maintain the high standards it set out for itself and continues to make geek chic the thing to aspire to. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|This is The Cure's best album: Disintegration. It's been totally remastered from the original 1989 release, and sounds great. But the real treat here is the CD of studio demos. These mostly instrumental tracks are gorgeous slabs of pure pop, better than anything on the radio today. I can listen to the early versions of \\"2 Late\\" and \\"The Same Deep Water as You\\" all day. Rock and roll may have died, but The Cure lives on!
B002MXA7TC|5.0|I came to the music of The Temper Trap, as I'm sure many others have, off the back of `Sweet Disposition' and it has quickly become one of my favourite albums of the year. In fact it is never out of my stereo at the moment. From the opening track `Love Lost' you know you are in for a real treat and this album doesn't let you down at all. This band have their own unique sound and the singer has very distinctive and original vocals, but if you enjoy bands like Death Cab For Cutie then I recommend this album and think it will be right up your street. `Sweet Disposition' is a very strong track and the way it builds with the underlying jangly guitar really adds to it's impact and power. But more subtle tracks like `Soldier On' have real nuance and show the breadth of this bands talents. I also love the chorus of `Science of Fear` which keeps driving the song forward and makes you want to sing along with it full belt. The last track `Drum Song' is instrumental and whilst raw, is a great way to end this album. I could quite easily wax lyrical about this album but suffice it to say that it is original, has excellent song writing and would well benefit you to take a listen. It is one of those life enhancing albums and I can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

0312600844|1.0|First, I must confess to a bias, because [[ASIN:0312421273 The Corrections: A Novel]] has to be the most-despised book in my library.<br />Why do I keep it? To remind me that fame and good press does not necessarily mean that the emperor is well-dressed!<br /><br />I bought [[ASIN:0312600844 Freedom: A Novel (Oprah's Book Club)]] right out of the gate, deliberately trying to expand<br />my personal horizons. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be even worse than 'The Corrections'. Poorly-packaged drivel!<br /><br />I did try to think of something positive to say, but frankly, there are no redeeming features to this inane story.
B001KW0C96|3.0|`Righteous Kill' is a pretty formulaic and sedate thriller starring two giants of cinema whose talents are sorely underused. Following some NYPD detectives who are tracking down a vigilante cop this film has very few surprises and you can guess the ending from about twenty minutes in. The acting is ok, but not great and although both De Niro and Pacino are legendary actors, they always feels a bit stilted and lacking of any conviction in this film. The storyline is sadly unoriginal and without any great shocks or twists, but it does keep you engaged for the 90 minutes duration. Any longer and you'd get restless though. For all it's flaws this film is not that bad overall and when you want an easy evenings viewing, where you don't have to think too hard, then this is a pretty good place to go. There are better thrillers out there and I have seen De Niro and Pacino in better films, but this is still worth a watch.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0671646788|5.0|The book came to me in excellent shape.  I'm half way through it now, and think it's worth ten times what i paid for it.

B0021L8V0W|3.0|For all it's flaws I found `Salt' to be a reasonably entertaining film.<br /><br />Following a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian sleeper agent who then goes on the run, we see Jolie shoot and fight her way out of numerous scrapes.<br /><br />This is one of those films you need to suspend your disbelief to fully enjoy as it has so many inaccuracies and far fetched aspects that you could very quickly wind yourself up by pointing them all out.  If you manage to do this you should be able to enjoy this for what it is; a fast paced, espionage action film where you don't need to think to hard to enjoy it.  You can guess the various twists and plot revelations very early on, but it doesn't stop them being enjoyable when they are revealed.<br /><br />Jolie is very bland in this film, as are all the actors really and Li ev Shreiber is probably the best actor on offer.  The direction is ok, nothing special and the stunts are adequate enough.<br /><br />All in all this is a perfectly serviceable spy action film and like I mentioned at the start, for all it's flaws (which are numerous) it does still manage to entertain, which is about all we can hope for.  Worth a viewing, just don't expect anything outstanding.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0048LPRD2|5.0|Gaspar Noé's 'Enter the Void' dazzles, disturbs, terrifies, and, in its own perverse way, enlightens. Some have condemned it as glossy pornography--pretentious and boring. But I argue that such reactions are misguided, and that the film seeks to create silence and meditation (just before it throws an avalanche of shattered glass into your expectations). Regardless of one's emotional reaction, no one can deny the incredible technique and craft that went into this production. The cinematography is unforgettable, oscillating between moments of claustrophobic first-person (shot through the eyes of the protagonist) and dazzling, free-floating shots that hurdle across Tokyo through buildings and into walls and pipes and drains and bodies. The neon color-palette and strobing lights will blister your eyes (stay away from this film if you're epileptic).     This is not a film for everyone. It is sexually explicit (very little of the sex is staged, and very little is left up to the imagination), it is violent (a nightmarish car accident and a graphic scene of abortion are two of the highlights), and it is harrowing. Go watch a Hollywood Rom-Com if you like your movies digestible. But chances are, if you have a brave taste for cinema, or if you have heard about this film through the grapevine and your interest was piqued, then 'Enter the Void' is a must-see.
B003PZEF0S|4.0|Season five has been keeping in line well with the Who reboot except with a little more class.  This episode is a prime example how the individual parts are a bit silly (old people shooting pollen) but the overall concept and message is very strong.  I actually like this balance and wouldn't want them to \\"fix\\" the silly parts as thats what makes it Dr Who in my opinion.  Goofily deadly serious.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Great series!! This told Henry VIII's story both the good points and the bad. The grizzly part of his history was not sugar coated as it had been in the past. The series conclusion was awesome!  This series is not for kids-- it was heavy on blood and sex. But how ca. You tell this story without heavy doses of both? I loved The Tudors.
030746363X|5.0|I had this book on pre-order for 2 months waiting for it to come out.  I was a huge fan of Tim's previous book 4 Hour Work Week.  I was so pumped with this new book!  I love the premise that you don't have to spend an hour or two at the gym, 6 days per week.  I went out and bought a kettle bell.  I haven't had such a challenging, but fun workout in years!  I've lost 7 pounds since Jan 1, and I'm really not following the diet!      I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for new information on weight loss and building muscle!
030746363X|5.0|Honestly, anything I say here will simply be echoing the sentiments of the folks above. Buy the book. Don't be scared off by its 400+ pages.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I have no problem with the show's writing; there's rarely a boring moment.  The story is well thought out and the dialogue is actually pretty good.  And the creators, in the DVD extras, are the first to admit that there's zero attempt to make the show historically accurate.  It's total fantasy in virtually all aspects.  I have no problem with the sets and use of \\"green screen\\" technology for backgrounds. I have no problems with the costumes-they're wild, sexy and fit the show.  I have no problem with the nudity or sex.  Plain fact, read any historical accounting of ancient Rome and you soon realize blatant nudity and sex were as common back then as porn on the internet is to us now.  So the show is in no way being \\"gratuitous.\\"  If anything, the show's tempered to what Roman times were really like.  BUT, BUT, BUT what I do have a huge problem with is the cringingly bad action scenes.  The action \\"style\\" is an unabashed rip-off of the movie \\"300.\\"  It was bad in \\"300\\" and it seems ten times worse here.  Super crappy CGI in nearly every action scene. Gallons of CGI blood splattering across the screen.  Stupid freeze frames.  Over the top unrealistic feats such as people jumping up into the air with heavy armor on.  Cheap gory effects of decapitations, limbs being cut off, guts spilling out that all look like they were done by a teenager with a computer in his basement.  The unbelievably schlocky and bad action sequences ruin the show.  Other than that, though, it's FANTASTIC!  Four and a half stars!
B0033AX20E|5.0|The debut album of Dragonforce was a breath of fresh air for the power metal genre at the time it was released. All we had at that point were bands like Edguy and Stratovarius who, while they were great, weren't fast enough to satisfy some of us who wanted super speedy, positive feeling music, so when Dragonforce came along, a lot of us let out a sigh of relief and grabbed this disc as fast as we could. Now, I'm not saying I was one of those people, cause my infatuation with power metal didn't come until a few years ago. I used to be into death and metalcore, but sometimes we all gotta move on to greener pastures. However, I have been a DF fan for several years now.<br /><br />I own all of DF's CD's, all the reissues of course, but I used to own an original copy of VoTD, before the reissue, back in 08 probably. I loved the album but I thought the production was just a bit too muddy. I knew how much potential these songs had, but the production was so poor on them that I knew they'd never get the recognition they deserved. However, I still loved the album and considered it to be Dragonforce's best CD to date.<br /><br />Fast forward to present time and we have this beautiful little opus, now fully remastered and with a bonus track. How could you not pick up this album if you were a big fan of the original?<br /><br />From the epic chorus of the first REAL track, 'Valley of the Damned', to the pure epic-ness of 'Heart of a Dragon', there is never a boring moment with this disc. I also feel this is the only Dragonforce CD that doesn't feel like you're listening to one really long song. That's not a bad thing by any means, I'm not dissing DF in any way by saying that, but their later albums tend to bleed into each other. Every song is epic battle music, something that makes you feel good about yourself. With most metal, it makes you angry and want to fight or kill something- with DF, you feel like you can do anything, like you are alive and powerful... Well, at least I do.<br /><br />Every song on this album is great and I can't complain about any of them. Where Dragons Rule isn't as great as the rest of the album but it's nice to have it on the disc. The bonus DVD is cool, there's footage of them recording VoTD and you get to see Sam drunk, but the real prize is the live video of the band performing Valley of the Damned in Tokyo, a video that I believe captures one of their best performances of all time.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you like Dragonforce, buy this reissue. If you liked the original VoTD, buy this reissue. If you are curious about DF, buy this. You just can't go wrong here.s album is great and I can't complain about any of them.

Even if you eventually quit the Slow-Carb diet, you'll never forget how to blunt blood-sugar spikes, how to use ice to stimulate weight-loss, and the importance of spincach.

My guess is that whomever owns the rights to it won't let go. I could look up why, but I'm not THAT bored. I haven't seen it included on ANY HL&N greatest hits collections. So just wanted to warn would-be buyers that it's missing from this collection. Maybe try to find it as a single, or buy SPORTS as well.

I raved about it to family and friends when I went to see it and have been anxiously awaiting its release to DVD/BluRay so I can keep enjoying this movie for quite sometime.  For me definitely a 5 star movie!

It has really sparked a bigger interest in me around RUNNING and I have highlighted so many things in the book I am going to start researching after I finish this one.  Very well written, incredibly engaging and so much information - I am a total novice runner that did not even know about ultrarunning -I thought the top o' the line was marathons and I am into it!!  I love learning more about the history of running and its evolution; as well as recognizing it as the most natural and joyful act known to man.
0452287022|5.0|This is one of those novels that you just must read.  As a fan of the painter Vermeer I found it enjoyable of several levels.  I won't go into detail with the review, as there are more eloquent reviewers here that have given a more than adequate review.  I will say this; if you've seen the movie and liked it, please do yourself a favor and read the book.  But I must warn you, be prepared to fall in love with it.
0446672653|5.0|This true story is astounding. It will open your mind and heart to a new and deeper understanding of life and love and the power of God in all of our lives. While assisting two separate clients to gain relief from their inner sorrow and ongoing relationship problems, through past life regression, Dr. Weiss discovers a secret. A man and a woman who have never met one another in this life are relating past life stories, during regression, of the same exact incidents from ancient lifetimes, told from different perspectives. He begins to realize that these two are actually soul mates who have yet to find one another in this life. Through subtle means he helps them to notice one another, sparking a growing inner recognition that very soon leads to friendship and blissful marriage. These formerly lonely souls are reunited in a deep and wonderful love. A love that has spanned the ages and many embodiments. This book is full of wisdom and wonderful insights into higher truth. It's based on actual transcripts of the regression sessions and is a miraculous true story that is truly heart-warming and eye opening. I recommend it to anyone seeking the true meaning of life and the true source of love.
030746363X|5.0|When I received the book, I began by breaking one of the first rules mentioned: I read it from cover to cover.  While I haven't tried anything outside of the slow-carb diet yet, I'm proud to say I've lost nearly 15 pounds in three weeks.  All with no exercise. I don't plan to add that until the weight loss slows.  I've since seen Tim on Dr. Oz and am impressed by the criticism he received.  I've been able to add some cheese to my eggs in the morning after some close monitoring for adverse side effects, and all my slowly shrinking pants are fitting like designer clothes again.  Thanks Tim for the great information and encouragement to experiment.  There's a real sense of freedom with the loss of weight, and especially the loss of conventional rules.
B0029LHW68|5.0|This is an amazing 3rd cd from 30 seconds to Mars. From start to finish it is a flawless cd. I haven't taken this cd out of my disc changer in my car since I bought it in Dec 2009. I love how they included their fans in several songs and also on the cover art. I love this cd:)
B002ITB3PM|4.0|Entertaining series but started to fall apart in the second season. Would highly recommend the 1st season and recommend the 2nd just for closure.
B0016OM3TU|5.0|I like jazz even though I'm not an expert; however, my husband is.  He kept telling me you have to see this movie.  Well, I did.  Dexter Gordon is amazing. The music is amazing.  It's as if you're in a time machine and you are right there in the room, in the club, or on a Paris street.  Don't miss it.  'Round Midnight touches your spirit.
0811876373|5.0|I just received this book yesterday and looked through it this morning. Its a very well laid out book, very colorful and incites me to get making them. This cake ball idea is all new to me and Im excited to try it and I believe the book did that for me. Happy to add it to my cookbook collection.
B0043RGY60|5.0|If you're already a listener of 30STM, then you know that this album is wicked!! If you've never heard of them or listened to them before, then crawl out from underneath that rock you've been living under, and BUY THIS ALBUM!!  This deluxe edition has some bonus tracks (including a cover of Lady Gaga's Bad Romance and Kanye West's Stronger) and also has a bonus DVD that is amazing.  The songs are great to listen to - and if they can take a super poppy song like Bad Romance and create a completely different spin on it (a spin that is even better than the original if you ask me) and on the same record create a song like Stranger in a Strange Land, then that's alright with me.  Believe me, buy this, download it, whatever you need to do, LISTEN TO IT!! I promise you won't be disappointed.
0792151712|5.0|OUR ENTIRE FAMILY ENJOYED WATCHING TITANIC!  THE THREE HOURS WENT BY VERY QUICKLY. IT'S AN OLDIE, BUT GOODIE. WE ALL GIVE IT FIVE STARS!
B00418NXBK|4.0|Nice lil direction they are going in... Not like their previous records, kinda of like when Pearl Jam did No Code.  It's a departure from their previous sound but still a tight record to listen too.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Pros: Wicked fast, stays cool, handles everything I throw at like it's nothing. So far 100% reliable (as any processor should be).<br /><br />This is a rock solid build, and I would certainly recommend it especially for gamers.<br /><br />Cons: Very convenient but I didn't use the contact paste that came with the stock cooler, I use Artic Silver anyway and the trouble of wiping off the paste was a little annoying.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: I was so happy that I could still drop this CPU on my AM2/AM2+ ASUS M3A785-EM motherboard along with my 8Gb DDR2 800Mhz memory, this help extended my the life of my computer another year or two.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|1. All the films in one set for the first time.<br />2. Blu-Ray format.<br />3. It pisses off a couple of fanboys who actually care whether Greedo or Han shoot first. Which this makes me laugh.<br /><br />These films have been number 1 on my list to be put on Blu-Ray format since Blu-Rays release, and here it is. A product thats 8 months a way from it's release date, and I can still say that was the easiest 5 stars Ive ever given something.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I bought this for my little sister, and she loved it. Had a minor scratch on it which made it skip through one small part of the movie(literally 5 sec) but my dad had dry wax which took it away instantly. Besides that perfect movie for the family.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I always wanted to see this in the theater but I never had time to, then someone got me an Amazon gift card and I figured, what the hell, and bought it. Its very good and this one has 3 different versions.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I didnt know before i bought this that the avatar blu-ray had problems. It dosen't play on all blu-rays, so i contacted amazon, so that i could get a refund, and never heard anything back. so i am stuck with this movie and cant even watch it.
1433523930|5.0|This study bible is absolutely awesome. The detail put into is amazing and it's very easy to read. The only warning I would give is that if you order the \\"larger print\\", you are gonna need a backpack to carry it to church. It is about the size of a dictionary!
0385341679|5.0|I hated that I had to wait so long for Shadowfever to come out. But I thank you. It was the most enjoyable read from beginning to end. Although the end reminded me of a English murder mystery  where the butler done it....it was still very well done. The whole series was so different from anything else out there and I have recommended it to all my family and friends. It will go into may library for a re-read this summer. I look forward to the off-shoots you indicated in then end of this book....but please...don't keep us waiting to long.
0446195529|3.0|The fourth in the Camel Club series is okay - at least I finished it - although I could have put it down at almost any time and not felt I was going to miss much.  I don't find Baldacci a totally satisfying writer and probably the only reason I still read his books is because my sister gives them to me.    In this story - in Baldacci's constant theme of protecting America from its Spy Masters - John Carr (a.k.a. Oliver Stone) a recovering top assassin turned all American hero, is once again at odds with the government.  He's hired by the president to work for the government, then fired by someone in the government, then works on his own, then seems to be working with the government again.... It's that kind of book.  He avoids working with the Camel Club, then works with them, then tries to protect them, then endangers them... I could have skipped the ending even if it was needed to tie up a loose end.      The story opens with Carr nearly being blown up while walking in Lafayette Park across from the White House.  The explosion turns out to be more than it seems as missed clue after missed clue is revealed.  The theme of the story is about being misled by \\"clues\\" that turn out to be diversions.  Unlike the other Camel Club stories in which the fuddy-duddy members of the Club are in focus and make the story character rich and fun, this story is more like The Clash of the Titans and the Titans aren't all that interesting.  The usual and predictable people wear the black hats.      This book, unlike other Camel Club stories, has a lot of Deus Ex Machina twists and turns in which things happen and no one knows why.  Its solutions to its multiple problems are contrived and in many cases unbelievable.  Baldacci is a good story teller but I find his books really badly constructed.    [[ASIN:1609114337 The Tranquillity Initiative]]
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just when I startd to feel some of his more recent works are getting too predictable this one surprises!Loved the twist on Katie's neighbor especially but there are a few others along the way too.  A great read!
030746363X|4.0|Like his first book, the 4 hour Work Week, the 4 Hour Body gives you lots of tips and tricks to try.   For people who have struggled with weight and/or personal appearance issues, the 4 Hour Body gives helpful suggestions to get you the body you want.  I am definitely trying some of the ideas in this book!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This was a Christmas present to my son who is British (hanging on to his roots but living in Canada).      I was pretty sure he'd love this and he did - but his partner and her family - who have Estonian roots, plus neighbours of the wild variety of nationalities to be found in every Toronto street: Italian, Maltese, Chinese and French Canadian watched with us night after night.      Which proves that this wonderful series has international appeal in both humour - and for heaven's sake it surely should be outdated by now what with all the current rubbish on cable, but it simply isn't. Hugh Laurie as the rich layabout, Bertie Wooster, is a master actor, not just a comedian, suave, silly, clever and ever so well dressed. His ingenious, elegant butler, Jeeves, gives us Stephen Fry in a performance he's never bettered. There then - divine!     As for Bertie's awful upper-crust friends, his tiresome relations (Aunt Agatha), the casts in every episode are a sheer joy.    Buy it - whoever you are - and where ever you come from. There's also Frazier of course: [[ASIN:B000VDDE18 Frasier: The Complete Series]]
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|This is a very good, but short presentation about the Grand Canyon and some of the long range problems with the Colorado River.  Photography is just great and it makes one want to take a raft ride down the Grand Canyon.  I just wish the movie was longer and we would get to see more of the canyon.    Other review comments by global warming deniers are just part of their attempt to put their head in the sand.  This movie presents a level headed and fact-based story that needs to be seen and heard.
0385528752|5.0|Brilliant.  Brilliant. Brilliant!<br /><br />In the acknowledgment section of _Switch_, the author brother team of Chip and Dan Heath realize that \\"no thank-you would seem adequate for all that our family has done to support us, but we'll thank them anyway.\\" Similarly, no review would be adequate for all that this book contributes to our understanding of human behavior and change, but I'll write this review anyway.<br /><br />The authors use a wonderful metaphor for the three key forces that must be optimized for any lasting change to occur: the rational Rider, the Emotional elephant, and the supportive Path. In the authors' own words: \\"When change works, it tends to follow a pattern. The people who change have clear direction, ample motivation, and a supportive environment. In  other words, when changes works, it's because the Rider, the Elephant, and the Path are all aligned in support of the switch.\\"<br /><br />_Switch_ is amazing on so many levels. The content is fascinating, and made incredibly applicable to making changes in all areas of our lives, from work and school to interpersonal relationships and self-care. The writing style and tone are so human and genuine: reading this book feels like being spellbound in a room with the most interesting decoders of human behavior.  (OK, I realize that sounds a bit like hyperbole, but it accurately reflects how I felt as I was completely enthralled with each word of this uncannily captivating book.) And, the way the authors were able to integrate years of research from the fields of psychology, sociology, and business to develop a prescription for change that's so organic with the way humans really work is just beyond-words impressive.<br /><br />How can I motivate you to read this book? Let me demonstrate how well Chip and Dan's three-pronged \\"How To Make A Switch\\" prescriptive works:<br />1. Direct the Rider:<br />---Follow the bright spots:<br />Your reading this review shows that you're already set to make significant changes in your life.<br />---Script the critical moves:<br />The next step is just to continue reading this review.<br />---Point to the destination:<br />By the time you finish this book (which you're getting increasingly ready to purchase here), you'll have such an improved understanding of why you do the things you do, and how you can do more of the things you want to do.<br /><br />2. Motivate the Elephant:<br />---Find the feeling:<br />That same inspiration brought you here to learn more about this book is going to guide you on every step you take in your change journey. Notice how good that feels right now.<br />---Shrink the change:<br />All you need to do right now to get on the path to change is (1) buy this book; (2) wait for it to arrive; (3) read the front cover flap as soon as you take it out of the box; (4) trust the rest of the change process will take over from there. No big life changes are required.<br />---Grow your people:<br />Your reading this review shows you're a change-ready person.<br /><br />3. Shape the Path:<br />---Tweak the environment:<br />That 1-Click ordering button over there ---> is about to set your change process in motion.  Click now!<br />---Build habits:<br />Just reading 10 pages a day of _Switch_  (will you choose the 10 minutes right after you wake up or the 10 minutes right before you go to bed? ) is all you need to commit to in order to see lasting change.<br />---Rally the herd:<br />Get your friends and family on board; be sure to share with them all of the life-changing insights you encounter while reading _Switch_. (Actually, when they see how naturally you're making mind-blowing changes in your life, they'll automatically be on board with you. &lt;Just be sure and keep your personal copy of _Switch_ in a safe place.>)<br /><br />Look at that--you've already taken the first step to change before you even got your hands on the book. See, I told you this book is brilliant!<br /><br />(And, even though no reviewcan capture the brilliance of this book, hopefully this one has inspired you to make the switch you're so ready to make.)<br /><br />Ready. Set. Switch!n capture the brilliance of this book, hopefully this one has inspired you to make the switch you're so ready to make.)<br /><br />Ready. Set. Switch!
0765318741|5.0|I LOVE this book. I completely disagree with those who say it 'ends abruptly'... I don't understand that at all. I think it has a beautiful, very powerful and affecting ending; where it is very clear what has happened, and what is about to happen. I wish I could say more, but that would ruin it! Please don't judge this book by any of the film adaptations, they are awful and not at all faithful to this superbly written novel. I love, love, loved it.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|This film was excellent.   As was the entire SAW series.......this just was a great way to end it.  Hey,theese are my opinions...you may not like them all. I do.   But this one in my view is the best.  The SAW series is famous for plot twists.  This one has the biggest one of all.   And it actually makes more sense of the other movies.   Check this out....rent it first if you want.   Then buy it....like I did.   (I didn't rent it;though I caught in the theaters.)  Great xcast feaeturing;Sean Patrick Flanery.   So....if you love SAW......you'll love how it ends.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|Beautiful, that's what this story is. I admit to not reading much mainstream fiction, but this one is beautifully crafted, the pacing is pitch perfect, and the characters are each distinct, interesting, and believable.<br /><br />Vida is delightfully eccentric despite her crotchetiness. Margaret starts out as this very organized classical fiction reader, who develops impulses throughout this book, and following her journey as she takes down the biography of Vida was engaging.<br /><br />There are a few points in the book where I got a little lost as to what was happening. But for the most part, the story swept me along, and I didn't resist. Even though this isn't a fantasy novel - it is at its core, a mystery, not a thriller mind you, but there was a certain mystical quality to it that I believe will make this appeal to fantasy readers.
0786955716|4.0|Don't listen to the other reviewers, the roof tiles are still here!  The box top and bottom are properly scaled roof tiles, and the sides of the box look like columned building walls.  In other words, you still do get 2 \\"roofs\\" worth of tiles.<br /><br />Tile quality is high; good thick cardstock.  You can make a decent sewer, dock building, inn, market square, or fortified manor (not including the flavor pieces).  Well worth the not even 15 dollars in my opinion.
1416955070|3.0|Given Cassandra Clare's background of starting her writing in Harry Potter fanfic, I suppose it isn't particularly surprising that her debut mirrors a lot of the ideas. Granted, she does add some of her own twists, but I can't help but think that this is Harry Potter chick-litified with demons instead of dark wizards.<br /><br />I will admit to enjoying Jace's cheeky bloated ego. The dialogue he has with Clary are quite amusing, and these scenes are the only one where Clary's constant sarcasm seems less rude. Simon, besides being a potential love interest and source of angst, doesn't seem to play much role, and therefore, doesn't seem to have much meaningful character development (besides some sulking).<br /><br />One minor thing, I kind of get the title but not really. Also, the ending was interesting, and although not entirely unpredictable, at least different. I'm not really sure why this book was so popular, but I can see how it might be a nice guilty read.
030746363X|5.0|I've been following Tim ever since he wrote the 4 hour work week....So I picked up the 4HB today and I cannot put it down!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I ordered this for my husband for Christmas because he really liked Band of Brothers. He loved it. Neither of us experienced WWII in person, but the series was realistic and gritty. I think I read reviews by people who said they were there and it wasn't real. My father and uncle felt it was pretty acurate. They also liked Band of Brothers. Bottom line, if you liked Band of Brothers, you will probably like this, too.
6305428425|4.0|I watched this last night, and was a little better than I expected. Romy and Michele were adorable and hilarious together. They're two dim-witted best friends that live together ever since they graduated. When they hear about their high school reunion, they try to make an attempt to better themselves and make good impressions to all their friends. I highly recommend ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION!!!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Wow. Just wow.  I stumbled onto this series just last month and, frankly, I don't know how other readers managed to contain themselves waiting on this last installment.  It was excrutiating for me and it was only a matter of weeks.  But it was sooooo well worth it. This series is one of the best I have ever read.  To date, my all-time fave has been the Jeanine Frost Night Huntress seris.  Nothing came close to it.  This series is right there with it at the top of my list.... and I've read and liked the Kate Daniels series, the Chicagoland Series, the Nalini Singh Archangel series, the Mercy Thompson series (just okay), the Succubus series, and countless other less memorable ones.  I LOVED THESE BOOKS! Highly addictive--which I've been looking for for soooo long.  Now, I'm a little depressed.  What could possibly follow the Mac and Barrons story?  Any suggestions for a really good series that follows a building relationship between the same characters?
1594202842|5.0|Please read it before judging it. You will laugh, cry from bottom of your heart. This is a master piece.
B004AG55S2|4.0|So I see they released \\"A Serbian Film\\" and as promised is cut which in my opinion is a horrible thing. Yes this movie is extreme to the fullest and doesn't really start getting that way till about half way through but if you did your research on this movie you would know that the director is making a statement of how he feels the people in Serbia are being treated by the government there.<br />Anyhow this movie is about an aging retired pornstar who is running low on money and is coaxed into doing an art type porno with a new upcoming director, he gets into it and the more he goes the weirder things start to get until it becomes unbearable and uncomfortable at which time he trys and quit. The director has other plans though and drugs the actor than has him do a string of horrible things on film for his project, the things he does are truely horrible and down right messed up all the way to the distrubing end.<br />If you cant handle gore and disturbing scenes of sex and violence don't watch this movie. If you wanna see it do not get the cut version, find an uncut version for the full affect ala kickasstorrents dot com. Again this movie is very extreme but good, you have been warned.....
B000NJMJGG|5.0|Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) is a Nelwyn, one of a race of small people who live quietly in their fertile, isolated country, farming and hunting and doing their best to keep clear of the Daikini, or full-size humans.  Happily married with a son and a daughter, his ambitions extend no further than the hope of being chosen as an apprentice by the High Aldwin (Billy Barty), the sorcerer of his people; but though he has some skill at sleight-of-hand, when it comes time to be tested, he lacks the self-belief that will make him a candidate.  But when his children discover a Daikini infant by the riverside and a terrible and ferocious doglike beast pursues it to the village, he finds that he must take the child to its own people.  What he doesn't know is that the baby is in fact Elora Danan, who according to prophecy is to overthrow the sorcerer-queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) and her ruthless army, commanded by General Kael (Pat Roach) and the queen's warrior daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley).  Bavmorda, of course, doesn't want to be overthrown, and she means to kill Elora--and anyone who stands in her way.  Willow teams up with Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), a roguish young mercenary who calls himself \\"the greatest swordsman who ever lived\\" (and, as Willow discovers, it's not far from the truth) and a pair of brownies (Kevin Pollak, Rick Overton) lent him by Cherlindrea (Marva Holme), the queen of the forest, who gives him a magic wand to deliver to the sorceress Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes), and through narrow escapes and wild battles the quartet finally confront Bavmorda in her own castle, backed by Madmartigan's old friend Airk (Gavan O'Herlihy), a young mercenary officer who's lost much of his command to Bavmorda's forces.    This was the first Lucasfilm movie I ever saw after the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies, and my first reaction was, \\"Special Effects must have had a ball!\\"  With trolls, transformations, a two-headed fire-breathing beast, and a lightning-slinging duel between Bavmorda and Raziel, it's ILM in full flower.  It's also full of derivatives of the two trilogies.  There's a good deal of Han Solo in Madmartigan, who learns about friendship, love, and the importance of finding a cause he can give his heart to, and Willow bears a certain resemblance to Luke Skywalker--a simple farmer with a gift he has to learn to use and to have faith in.  There's a chariot chase that echoes the motorcycle one in [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)]] and a wild mountainside slide (on a shield) that will remind viewers of the raft going down the Himalayas in [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition)]].  There's a rough-edged, semi-barbaric look to Willow's world, as if civilization weren't as old there as it is in, say, LOTR; things look used or improvised as they often do in [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]].  For all that, this is also a story in its own right, the theme of which is the importance of resisting evil, and very well done.  It's certainly among my favorites of the genre.
0385341679|3.0|Since the previous hundred or so reviews gave an excellent synopsis of the book, I will simply give a review here.  I am a big fan of not only the fever series, but of Mrs. Moning herself.  She is an excellent writer, and seemed set and ready to produce what promised to be the ultimate final chapter to what has been a hands-down amazing series.  Though after quite a long wait and an incredible amount of tension, Shadow Fever simply did not live up to what I expected it to be.       Many of the most burning questions are indeed answered, yet in ways that are either flimsy and shallow, or confusing and generative of more questions. Almost as if Mrs. Moning created so many questions that she simply couldn't get the answers out fast enough.  I was left with a good many unresolved questions and characters after the final chapter ended; in fact, far too many to feel completely satisfied or even at ease with the story.  What about Christian? The Seelie Queen? The Seelie court? The other Five members of Barron's crew? Dani?...um, the entire world full of people?! And in the end, the scene was so outrageously domestic after so much darkness in the books that I almost laughed out loud in disbelief. I mean, Barrons grilling steaks while Jane and the Lanes bring wine for a nice dinner party? Come on now. Didn't essentially an Armageddon just happen?       As far as the characters, many of them were just as disjointed as the storyline. There were so many emotional crises from Mac that by the end it simply got a bit wearisome. There are almost entire chapters of her emotional wallowing that seem both superfluous and distracting! To be honest, her character had so many twists and turns that I am actually still mildly confused where she came from and exactly who (she thinks) she is.  Barrons loses his intrigue and cool sophistication in place of wild emotion and absolutely unbelievable tenderness.  Danni loses her conviction and refreshing grit in place of bratty carelessness and irritating superiority. The normally artful evolution of characters that Moning crafts into her books is lost here; grafted clumsily onto the storylines to the point where it seems superficial. Sadly, the transformations are almost too comical to recount.  Other characters pop in and out with poor cohesion to all of this madness, creating a stew too heavily spiced to be quite palatable.       Therefore I must give the book a three. Good, but not at all Mrs. Moning's best.
B004FLW2F6|3.0|After being impressed and enjoying A.F.'s gold disc issue of \\"Talking Book\\", i must say \\"F.F.F.\\" does not compare as well when played a-b with the 2000 Universal/Motown remaster.  The first thing i noticed is it seems the air has been sucked out of the studio.  After i raised the volume of the A.F. version significantly the comparison improved, and i think i detected the analog-ish smoothness i believe Mr. Gray worked to create.  However, i've decided to hang on to my 2000 disc as several times during comparison i had the thought i preferred it.  Mr. Broussard may have much better quality equipment than my humble Yamaha/Infinity setup, and i'd happily stand corrected if someone goes to the trouble to describe just why this gold disc is better.  But, after learning of the wrong generation \\"Aja\\" masters being delivered to Mobile Fidelity, and John Dent's discovery that the polarity was reversed on \\"Skylarking\\" for all issues from 1986-2009, i know better than to just accept new as better.
1416972250|5.0|This book was so incredibly good, everything I could ever ask for and more in a book--lovable characters, character development, humor, exciting adventure, intriguing mystery, and great twists. Yes, just when you think there couldn't possibly be any more twists that Cassandra Clare couldn't pull off in this story, she surprises you and pulls out a few more from up her sleeve. The biggest twist of all (I won't give anything away) is pulled off very well in my opinion. We also get a pleasant change of scenery--the majority of the book takes place in Alicante, the Shadow Hunter's city.    There's really only one thing I didn't care for--two of the characters being gay and their relationship. This might bother some readers. I absolutely loved both of these characters, don't get me wrong, I just don't agree with their lifestyle. That's just my opinion...    These books instantly became favorites, and I can't understand the negative reviews. They are well written, the characters feel real, and they are entertaining and exciting. What more could you ask for? I highly recommend the Mortal Instruments series and I can't wait for City of Fallen Angels in April!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|This box set contains seasons 1-4 as well as the miniseries, the plan, and razor. remember not to buy those extra if you were thinking about it. This boxset is set up better than the original boxset from what hear which was set up in slipcases. this box set has each season bundled separately in the normal season sets. Great buy for those fans who don't already have any seasons already. doesnt contain anything exclusive to the boxset itself
030746363X|4.0|The common trend among bad reviews is easy to spot: none of them tried anything written in the 4HB. They read it, didn't like what it said or disagreed, then call it bogus. That is bad practice people! If you want to write a bad review after you've given a good 6-8 weeks to any of his methods with no results, by all means go ahead. But to call it bogus without ever attempting? You have no credibility. Go read your Cosmo or Maxim guide to better sex and six pack abs.    As for me, I'm closing in on one month of two specific diet and lifting programs outlined in the 4HB: The slow-carb diet and the deadlift/bench press workout combined with Occam's Protocol. My results are very good and I'm spending less time in the gym than ever before. I'm at 178 lbs and I've dropped 5 lbs of fat and gained 8 lbs of muscle. I bench pressed 275 lbs three times this week. Which is 10 lbs more than I ever did while playing college football for 4 years.     Results don't lie. You just have to try.
B00192IV9U|4.0|out of all 10 tracks on this album, I don't believe it's Michael's voice on three of the tracks. Since June 2009, when we lost our king, i've been waiting on Sony to release an album with unreleased material. Well finally, it has arrived but not the way we would have wanted.     The album starts off with \\"Hold My Hand\\" a duet with Akon. I actually do love this song, it should have been more successful then it performed. There also could of been alot better video filmed, but that is my opinion. The next track \\"Hollywood Tonight\\", is another good track. It sounds like it was recorded between the \\"Dangerous\\" & \\"History\\" albums. I can tell it's fully Michael on this track. The next track \\"Keep Your Head Up\\", is an ok track. I don't think Michael would have approved this song to be released on an album.     The song \\"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\\" should of been left alone. It was perfectly fine of how it was released on the 2004 \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" album. I also don't believe Michael would of approved to remix this track, the original version of the song was just fine. The next track \\"Monster\\", is a mess by itself. I do not believe this Michael singing on this track. An come on, Michael sings with 50 Cent? The same \\"rapper\\" that sang \\"Go Shorty, It's Yo Birthday\\", I HIGHLY doubt Michael would of teamed up with him on this track.    The song \\"Best Of Joy\\" is the best track on the album. The song is a simple pop but magical song. This song is 100% Michael and is the last song recorded by him. Written and recorded in 2009, during the rehearsals for \\"This Is It\\" concerts. Michael said he is forever and that he will be. This song should be released as a single. The song \\"Breaking News\\" is a mess. The song should of been left in the vault. I do not believe at all that this is Michael Jackson's voice on this track.     The duet with Lenny Kravitz \\"I Can't Make It Another Day\\" is another fine track on the album. It was recorded during the \\"Invincible\\" sessions but did notmake it onto the album. Michael's voice is very similar to the vocals on \\"You Rock My World\\". It's a fresh new track and nothing like he's done previously. I also wish this song would be a single. The next track \\"Behind The Mask\\" is an ok track. You can tell this track is dated in the 80's. In which it was recorded during the \\"Victory\\" album sessions.     The last track \\"Much Too Soon\\", is an average song. I don't think Michael would have approved to release this song, but Sony thinks diffirent. All in all, I actually gave the album 3 stars but gave an extra star because it's Michael. I've been a huge fan of Michael since I can remember and I will always be. No where does this album compare to his masterpieces \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Bad\\", & \\"Dangerous\\". Nor does it even compare to \\"History\\" or \\"Invincible\\". If Sony is going release another album soon, they better get back to the drawing board and make sure those songs are Michael quality.     Rest In Peace Michael, We Love You

B003Q6D282|2.0|I've been the biggest fan of the Saw series from the beginning. Even IV through VI I enjoyed more than most. The series really should have never gone past III, but I admired the way they were able to keep it interesting afterwards, even if they were grasping at straws by VI. VII is the final chapter and thankfully so because the acting and special effects are the worst yet by far. What story there was, was ruined by poor acting. On top of that the special effects, especially in the first trap we see at the beginning of the movie, are cheesy at best. The blood for whatever reason looked pink, which made it totally unrealistic looking. I really wanted this to end well, but sadly it didn't. Thankfully it won't get any worse from here out.
B004CLYKLI|3.0|Not sure how to review it because it was written well, easy to read as far as style and pacing.  I have a problem with what she is saying.  I had an abusive childhood so I cannot seperate the horrible things she said to \\"motivate\\" her children from physical abuse which she never says she did.      That being said, a few things really bothered me.  She says that to her sucess is being a lawyer or doctor, great next time your car breaks down lady go get it fixed by that loser mechanic or your hungry get a loser chef to fix you some food.  Sorry i digress, but she never discusses where happiness fits in to being succesful and even talks about how she just wandered around because she did not know what she wanted to do and kind of fell into the field she is in now and how she did not think she knew how to be happy.  How would she know what she wanted when she never got to make any choices?      She says she is humbled in the end by her daughter Lulu who stands up to her when she is 13, she never shows it.  She just seems to be so shocked her child said no that she does not know what to do but stop pushing her, then when she shows potential in tennis, her chosen activity she tries pushing her in that like she did the violin.  Even when Lulu tells her to stop she admits she is doing it behind the scenes still.  And read the afterward, that is not written by a women that was humbled by anyone.  She comes across as arrogant and self rightous.      She says that some of the closest times with Lulu were after long brutal practice sessions where they fought and she would come get in bed with her.  Does miss Chua really not understand it is a child looking for affirmation that her mother still loves her?    Also she never discusses how money comes into play regarding the success her children have at the piano or violin even though she talks about how much money she spends on everything.  Of course they are especially gifted because she is taking them to the some of the best teachers available, she pays for multiple teachers and tutors and thats all the kids seem to do.     Also regarding the birthday cards, I think this really shows what matters to the Chua.  Her family is out to dinner for her birthday and the girls give her cards they made.  To Chua they are not good enough so she insults them and makes them make her new ones.  This is telling on many levels.  Ruins the dinner for the whole family, even her parents tell her she is too hard on them.  The daughters say they did not have time because they were practicing.  Her response is to tell them they should have focused more so they would have had time to make her better cards.  All i could think was maybe they did not want to spend the few precious moments of free time making a card for a woman who constantly pushes, insults and berates them.  Did she ever think that maybe they did not want to make her a great card?  No.  She then tells us that the new cards that she FORCED them to make are in a box full of cherished items.  That says to me that what is important to Chua is not what comes from the girls hearts but what she forces out of them.  A constant theme in the book is how during the lessons and practices is her reaction to the music, how important it is to her, how lovely and moving it all is to her, never to the girls.      There is nothing wrong with pushing or having high standards for your children, I have them.  I just don't agree with the way Chua goes about them.  I don't believe you have to refuse food, water and bathroom breaks to make someone great. Especially a child.  So much is learned from playing, trying new things and exploring the world around you and things you will never see if all you do is focus on one activity for 4-8 hours a day.  Her husband is a went to Harvard and Harvard Law just like her, he was raised by a woman who parented the opposite of herself.  She never talks about that.
030746363X|5.0|The key takeaway from 4HB is his approach to finding out what works and what doesn't - particularly the MED (Minimum Effective Dose). Think of the chapters as guides to getting started in each area - once you've had a go you should assess your results and then troubleshoot if need be (he gives lots of advice for things to troubleshoot with). Don't just try it half-baked and then give up when you don't get results. We're all different to some extent but this book is a good place to start with its emphasis on measured results.

1599218011|5.0|Imagine living what you thought was a `healthy' lifestyle and then getting the wind quite literally knocked out of your sails with the diagnosis of a rare and potentially fatal disease?  Don't think it can happen to you?  Think again.  It happened to Kris Carr.  And it happened to me.  If it wasn't for Kris Carr coming to my rescue, I think I would have drowned in my own sorrow.  She quite literally made me see the \\"light\\" and I was able to swim to the top again.   Don't wait until you receive some bad news - there are things you can do NOW to empower yourself and feel better than you've ever felt before but it's going to take some re-education away from the SAD (Standard American Diet) way of life.  Just know this  - there ARE foods you can eat to improve the chemistry of your body.  There ARE practices you can develop to rev up your spiritual mojo.  There ARE ways to  learn and embrace a \\"new normal\\" and in the process make every day you have left breathing and loving on this planet more extraordinary than you could ever imagine.  Kris has done the legwork for you.  This is not just a book about a food diet, it's a life diet.  It's recipes for all your needs, not just food on the table.  Although it's a lot of information, you don't have to jump all the way in.  But just try...stick a toe in and then go a little deeper every day.  Take what you need and what will work for you and then try a little more of her sage advice.  I promise you'll come away with some nugget of wisdom that you haven't been offered anywhere before.  Kris has helped me develop a lifestyle and practice that works for me and I will always be grateful because despite being given my `expiration' date, too, I feel better than I've felt in years and I'm smiling and laughing again. A lot. I'm truly living now and know the time I have left will be filled with more spirit and joy than I could have imagined a year ago!

B00130VLZ4|5.0|The PERFECT carrying case for my canon rebel.  I wanted something I could slide over the camera when I'm going for a walk and have the camera around my neck - something other than a bag so the camera is right at hand, yet not without some protection from dust, etc.  This case is light weight, a perfect fit, and very easy to take on/off.  It has a small snap feature on one side to keep the case attached to the camera when you're using it (so you don't have to awkwardly find a place to put it, or carry it under your arm while you're taking shots).  It opens/closes with one simple velcro closure.  There are no pockets or anything, so you'll still need to place other accessories somewhere (pocket, etc.), but this is what I wanted - something as snug as possible.  This is a soft shell - so can't take the place of a camera bag, but as mentioned, it's perfect for those days when you plan to have the camera out for a significant amount of time.  Worth every penny and more!!!
B0009PAVI2|3.0|Takes in 3 filters in 3 slots, but overall the pouch is a little too big (top part). Had to readjust my SLR backpack organizer in order to hold this pouch now.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|Here's a hymn to welcome in the new album by the Decemberists- more finely crafted tunes by the kings of \\"hyper-literate prog rock\\" (as Stephen Colbert dubbed their genre).  Their new album should be championed by by lovers of great music and great languge alike, an album filled with freshly penned verses that sound like Old English ballads set to amazing musical arrangements.    The Decemberists hinted at things to come with \\"Picaresque\\" but then more fully embraced the folk/rock sound with \\"The Crane Wife\\", which had high peaks (\\"Sons and Daughters\\", \\"Yankee Bayonette\\", \\"Summersong\\", the title tracks) interspersed with more rock and jam oriented tracks.  It had the amazing sound of a truly great band emerging with their own unique identity.  You can almost hear the band splitting from a very good rock band to a great folk one on the album.  Their next disc, \\"The Hazards of Love\\", was an amusing mismash of prog-rock opera with some truly great songs (\\"The Rake's Song\\", \\"Isn't it a Lovely Night\\", the four part title track) and a lot of unmemorable ones.  It didn't feel so much like a step forward as it did like the band moving into a cul-de-sac, one from which the band has now easily emerged.     To my ears this album tops all their previous efforts though its charms are so understated that one or two casual listenings will not reveal them.  The songs are melodic, rely on beautiful structures and harmonies and grow with repeated listening.  I'd be shocked to not consider it one of the best twenty albums of the decade, or to still be listening to it years from now.      The album begins with an invocation to the change of season and two more of the songs are hymns to the seasonal opposites of January and June.  The feeling and the seasons are palpitable and Melloy's Middle English vocabulary add just enough strangeness to give the album a sense of true eeriness that are echoed by the piano, fiddle, and Jenny Conlee's backing vocals.  The absolute high point for me is\\"All Arise\\" which is a literally (and literary) rollicking plea to win back a lover.    It's interesting- Peter Buck seems such a straight-forward dude yet has worked with three of the most obscure, obtuse and outright weird lyricists of his generation (Michael Stipe, Robyn Hitchcock, Colin Meloy).  Also interesting- of Buck's best three albums of this decade only one has been with R.E.M. (Accelerate; the other two are Hitchcock's \\"Goodnight Oslo\\" and this one).    While much is said of the ghost of \\"Murmur\\" and \\"Reckoning\\" playing in the background stronger still is the ghost of the youth and summers past of Americana and folk that haunt the album and the listener with each repeated listening.  Truly beautiful and subltle and absolutely stunning, stunning, stunning.      Hear the hymn to welcome in the day  Heralding a summer's early sway  And all the bulbs all coming in, to begin  Thrushs' bleeding battle with the wrens   Disrupts my reverie again

1439102813|5.0|This heartbreaking book traces a woman's rapid descent into Alzheimer's disease. The patient is herself a psychologist, an expert on the human mind, and this conceit allows her to naturally provide insight into her condition beyond what the average patient could. The protagonist is a foil for the author, who is a neuroscientist, and so the book's scientific credentials are top-notch.    But it's not just technical chops that matter here; Genova can write. The story is told in a brisk, engaging, and absorbing way, and the reader feels the confusion, fear, and ultimate devastation of the book's characters. I'd recommend this book wholeheartedly for anyone with the least interest in the brain and its mysteries.

B001R0XNSI|4.0|The felt pen sucks.  Everyone knows it.  Don't buy this expecting it to be a pen.  They should have put a Sharpie type insert but didn't or made their pen removable so you could add your own.  The current pen is just inserted in to the Sharkie frame and glued in.  I recommend pulling the old pen out and inserting a mini Sharpie.  As the pen is glued in you will have to force it out and the pen casing is really glued in so I had to drill mine out but for about 15 minutes of work I now have an actual Sharpie in my Sharkie.    This is NOT supposed to be a daily jotting down notes in the office pen.  It's supposed to be more like a large permanent marker pen (aka Sharpie).  How many people use a Sharpie to take notes?  Takes 4 twists to remove the cap?  Stop crying.    As a tough defensive and utility tool it really works great.  The all black redesign takes away a lot of the \\"camouflage\\" aspect but it still blends in well.  I had to use this to pry a door open and it worked well, I thought is might break but took the chance as I had nothing else on hand but it is very tough.  The intended purpose for this device is defensive, it is a kubaton.  It is big in the hands and many of the women I have trained with find it just too big to handle well (insert joke if needed).  I have average sized hands and I think it is HUGE for a pen but fine for a kubaton.    All in all this is a great covert defensive tool.  $5-$8 is acceptable to pay, anything over $10 and you are nuts.    * I don't 5 star anything unless it changes my world.  4 stars is a great product in my book.

I like the big boxes and plastic sleeves that the seasons were previously packaged in, well season 5 did have a paper sleeve, but it was still ALOT nicer that season 6's packaging.

0060558121|4.0|Neil Gaiman has redefined the New World. Just as in Nevermore, Gaiman turned his unique perspective on the everyday and presented us with a strange tale that takes the reader across a different terrain; in this case, America.  In American Gods, Gaiman explores that happens to the old gods/ideas when they are replaced by newer versions.  The old gods decide that they're not going down without a fight, and each man (or woman) is on his own, with our hero, Shadow caught in the middle.  This urban fantasy / adventure has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, but there is plenty of action and adventure and weirdness to go around. It's a unique story from a unique and gifted writer.  Very entertaining.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|This is the 10th studio album by PT and let me say it's the best!

0634049011|5.0|This book is amazing.  I started to \\"learn\\" guitar 6 months ago.  I thought I had a good understanding of the guitar fretboard.  Once I started using this book I realized I was going about it the wrong way.  If I had used this book as the first thing I ever learned about guitar I would be 10 times better now.  Previously I had learned about 20 chord shapes, the major scale, and the minor pentatonic scale.  I could play lot's of songs by reading tab and listening, but now I can create original music.  It is so easy now.  The easy part of guitar is the technique, to a point.  The hard part is understanding theory and applying it to the fretboard quickly without much thought.  This book makes that easy.  Now I truly \\"see\\" the fretboard.  I am also starting to \\"see\\" patterns from songs and understand exactly where they come from and why.  Now, don't think if you buy this book and skim through it you will be a great guitar player.  You have to actually use it.  Follow their easily laid out directions and you will benefit greatly from it.  Simple ideas like reading, speaking, writing, and playing in different combinations truly do work.  It is more of a music course than just a book.    I also purchased an ear training book at the same time, \\"The 12 Notes of Music\\".  It goes perfectly with this book.  When you can see, hear, understand, and apply music you will be a great guitar player.  These two books can get you there.  I spent literally hundreds of dollars on guitar books previous to these two books, only to use once or twice and collect dust.  I am no longer looking for more guitar books.  I am finally content, and ready to become a great musician.  I hope you are too.  Rock on!

B004BLJQOK|1.0|This movie was by far the worst remake I've ever seen. It was completely unwatchable. Every single scene was stretched out to an intolerable length. It was 2 hours worth of long and slow panning shots. Almost every shot was a slow panning with an aweful musical score that tried to make every scene dramatic. I would honestly say that maybe 30 minutes of the 2 hours actually had any dialog. There was nothing good about this movie. The cast, camera work, music, and lighting were all horrible.     Save yourself the time and watch the original \\"Let the Right One In\\". It was an excellent film that was made just a couple years before this remake.

Personally, I watched my grandma and grandpa struggle and then quietly decide, \\"to stay or go.\\"  Their eyes flicker, as they seem to watch the movie of their life play before them.  Forman does an excellent job focusing on the experience and not the accident or the final decision.  A different kind of book - aimed at the Young Adult genre however, this \\"adult\\" very much enjoyed the perspective Forman shares.
B002ZG974M|1.0|I teach Developmental Psy and thought I'd look at this DVD over for the classroom. There is no way I can use this, it is a waste of time. There is no contextual editing, just a stream of footage, mostly boring, and some frankly gross.  Perhaps this might be useful for those interested in anthropology, as there are interesting cultural insights.But after watching  scenes of chickens in bed with babies (cringing at the potential of pecking!), wiping babies with corn cobs and a host of other health hazards, I was distracted from stated  thesis of \\"the universal love of mother's for their babies\\"  to the images of flies, animals and children eating dirt where the animals have been...you get the picture. In short, I got less of \\"babies\\" and their development, and more of a \\"kumbaya\\" message.There are some interesting discussion points regarding the difference between dominant Western cultures and less developed countries, as that seems to be the predominant point, and worth discussing. But it is NOT a joyful video of babies, nor does it give much insight into their development.  Perhaps this video may well be for you, but for those interested in development this may not help. The tag line on this DVS states: \\"If you were enraptured by March of the Penguins, wait until you see BABIES!\\" I liked March of the Penguins, I WAS enraptured by it...but BABIES? Not so much.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|RED (aka Retired Extremely Dangerous) is the moniker assigned to four retired CIA operatives, and if ever there were a film that demonstrates that folks beyond retirement age are still impressively functional, this is it.  The story is adapted from the graphic novel by Cully Hamner and Warren Ellis by screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber and directed with great style by Robert Schwentke.  But has been said often, it is the brilliant cast of experienced actors that makes this film one to treasure as simply splendid entertainment.<br /><br />Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored in his retirement; his only point of interest is a recurrent telephone conversation regarding his pension check with an equally bored government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker in a role that finally gives the range of her comedic talent its due!).  Their conversations are overheard by the CIA - William Cooper (Karl Urban) and his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) - and Frank is marked for assassination. Bu told frank is wily and outsmarts and out shoots his intruders, escapes to take Sarah away from her boring desk job and a caper begins.  It seems there is a plot to uncover the USA Vice President's involvement in a Guatemala coups and Frank seeks out his old confreres - Joe (Morgan Freeman, living in a nursing home but very alert and involved with CIA thinking patterns), Marvin (John Malkovich, a half crazy near delusional but very fine marksman living in an underground hideaway), and Victoria (Helen Mirren, living the elegant life of teas and social activities while privately still taking contract jobs to knock off bad people).  At first Sarah is perplexed by the 'abduction' on the part of Frank, but soon becomes an involved participant in the drive to expose the secret of the Vice President.  The group engages a retired Russian spy (Brian Cox) who just happens to be Victoria's old boyfriend, and together these REDs use their skills, and brains, and great humor to achieve their goal. It is the old REDs against the young CIA agents that provides the tug of war that makes the film soar.<br /><br />The cast sparkles in this richly colorful movie brimming over with CGI effects and impossible situations.  This is not a deep film but a movie that will entertain form the first frame to the final rather surprising episode.  It is a pleasure to simply watch the talents of Willis/Mirren/Freeman/Malkovich/Parker/Cox interact like so many pieces of a fine Swiss watch: they obviously love what they are asked to do!

He is very free, intuitive and real and his food is too.  This is a great cookbook, I'm so glad I purchased it.

B004FQX5CK|5.0|Finally, the version I've been waiting for and many others as well. For years Blade Runner fans have been subject to the insane number of versions of Blade Runner and even the 5 disc Blu Ray copy that really is not worth the price you pay. The Final Cut is the version to have if you truly love the Blade Runner experience and have always hated the annoying voiceover by Harrison Ford that has plagued various copies of the film. Ridley Scott himself was able to have full artistic license with this film and you will not be disappointed. What you will be greeted with is a very clean, crisp HD version of the film and just the best single copy out there without all the extra discs of fluff and crappier versions. This version has the omitted voiceover, alternate ending without the \\"happy resolution\\" and the inclusion of the Unicorn dream. Any other reviews that knock the film are most likely fans of the voiceover which spoon feeds you information and takes away the lonely rainy feeling you get when watching the film for the first time. Plus in my opinion without the added commentary you are able to judge the film for yourself and not be guided through every single little plot detail. The acting is spot on and perhaps my personal favorite Ford role to date. If you are going to have any science fiction film on your shelf please get this version you will not be disappointed. 5 stars on audio, visual effects, crisp colors and picture quality.
0760703329|5.0|Shakespeare requires no introduction -- he is \\"the Bard,\\" the most imposing playwright and storyteller in the English language. And \\"William Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" brings together every one of his 39 plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.<br /><br />The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.<br /><br />And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.<br /><br />But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.<br /><br />For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.<br /><br />There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").<br /><br />And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.<br /><br />Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest.age.

030746363X|5.0|Summary:<br />4 weeks, no exercise, 10 lbs lost, and I find it easy to do.<br /><br />Details:<br />I consumed the book on my kindle when it came out.  Started the diet the next day.  Dropped four pounds the first week, and a steady two pounds a week since then.  I didn't use any supplements or do any exercise for the first four weeks.  I found the first week to be a bit rough, but after I hit my first Saturday (cheat day) it was smooth sailing.  Let me stress that this weight loss included eating whatever I wanted on Christmas AND New Years Eve.  I ate pie, ice cream , mashed potatoes and gravy, huge steaks, drank whatever I wanted, and still lost weight.  It's not some sort of magic or voodoo, it's simply eating healthy six days does more good than eating crappy one day.  And that one day still does good physically and mentally.<br /><br />Another side effect is that I no longer get terrible migraine headaches.  I was popping a pile of Excedrin most days just to keep my eyes open.  I'm not sure if it's the stable blood sugar, the constant hydration, or something that I no longer over-consume but my headaches are a thing of the past.  My friends have noticed such a difference that six of them have picked up the book and started the diet with me.<br /><br />Gracias hermano por ayudarme a cambiar mi vida.  Pura vida!
B002ZG993Q|2.0|Simply boring. If you need to watch another movie and have already seen the others, then this will do.<br />OR...if you want to see a beautiful young woman having sexual ecstacy and walking in the nude then this might serve. She gets 5 stars, but the movie not so much. Actually, maybe Solaris is a little better, but I remember it as being very slow as well.<br />The Italian landscape and village areas are very nice...it's like an easychair visit to Italy so on a large screen it's very nice to see.
030746363X|5.0|I'm very impressed with this book, particularly how it cuts through all of the conventional thinking BS and shows you what WORKS. I definitely recommend it. Read it, understand it, implement it.
0634049011|5.0|Playing guitar on and off for 35 years.  I finally decided to find out what was actually going on, and how to really know my way around the fretboard, instead of just memorizing tunes and scales.  Thank god I found this book - it is a marvel.  There is some serious work in there if you're going to do it all, but it couldn't be any easier or any simpler than he makes it.  From the first page you are learning very useful and significant things, and are led through graduated exercises to real insight.  There is repetition galore - because that's how brains and fingers learn this kind of thing - but to someone who has longed for the mists to clear every step is a pleasure.  I am FINALLY understanding how a guitar works and with a little more work it will be permanently laid bare to me, like a piano keyboard.  Can't speak highly enough of this book.  I've scribbled answers and notes all over mine and when I start forgetting I will probably get another and do it all again.
0307592839|4.0|i love how this book just goes to show you how connected the human race is.  We all have our demons...our baggage...our past...that we're trying to reshape and forget and work through.  We are all bruised...we are all lost in some way, trying to re-find/redeem ourselves.  She gives us a glimpse into a handful of lives...jumping back and forth through time.  I got sucked into Egan's world.  I couldn't stop readingggg.
0060574216|5.0|If you thought you knew everything about the same or opposite sex then you are wrong. Some of the stuff in the book I read comes naturally to me but for the most part there is a lot that I also didn't understand as well. As in the rubber band method. I always knew not to chase the significant other but I didn't understand how one could become so hot and cold easily. Nor did I understand why I did it myself (wave theory). Overall this book is a must read for anyone. It's well written for anyone of all ages. It helps you to understand someone else while also understanding yourself. It's smart and sophisticated the way it was written. I always recommend it to anyone who just needs a read. Even if you're not having relationship issues read it anyways.
B003YOMNCM|3.0|This is as poorly produced an orchestral recording as I can remember. The winds dominate the soloist completely. The Tchaikovsky is so out of balance I don't trust what I hear of the new and unfamiliar Higdon. I'm having a bit of trouble hearing the described events and techniques.<br />Hahn plays fantastically well, and I do feel the lyric arc she speaks of in the restored Tchaikovsky. She holds my interest, in an unconventional way. A long way from Heifetz or Elman, but characterful.<br />But the balances are quite bad.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I can't even count how many times I've watched this movie with my daughters and it never gets old. This is not a movie I would brag about watching to my guy friends but deep down I know its one of the best movies ever made.
0385341679|5.0|This is the fifth, and final book, in the Fever series by Karen Marie Moning.  Is this really the end you say?  Well according to the afterward in this book Moning is working on a new series set in the Fever universe...so it is only kind of the end.  This was a very good book, the plot takes so many twists and turns it will leave you reeling and the story is nicely wrapped up in the end.  THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT READ PREVIOUS BOOKS IN THE SERIES, because you can't even talk about the first page of this book without having spoilers from the previous books.<br /><br />The book opens exactly where the fourth book,[[ASIN:0440244404 Dreamfever: The Fever Series]], left off.  Mac is standing over Barron's lifeless body, mourning.  Seeing Barron's body lying there lifeless breaks something in Mac and she decides to do whatever it takes to get the Sinsar Dubh.  If Mac can get the Sinsar Dubh she believes that she will be able to rewrite the whole world and existence as she knows it.  Mac in her desperation joins forces with the very person who is her sworn enemy, the Lord Master himself.<br /><br />I am not sure how to write a review of this book without having any spoilers, but I will do my best.  There are a number of huge revelations and crazy plot twists throughout this book.  Just when you think you have it all figured out Moning throws you a curveball and you are left sitting there with your mouth open thinking, \\"Did that really just happen?!\\"  Most of this book leans more to the urban fantasy genre, although there are some pretty steamy scenes in here too.<br /><br />This was one dense book.  There are so many players at this point that they story is almost epic in breadth.  The book is told from both Mac and Dani's point of view.  The Sidhe Seers, Druidic factions, Barron's mysterious group and the Fae all play large roles.  We learn what Mac is, we learn a ton about Fae's long existence, and we learn a ton about Barron's past.  Many startling truths are revealed.<br /><br />The pace is pretty non-stop, this is a very hard book to put down.  The action scenes were spectacular, but even more time is spent with Mac trying to work her way through the clues to solve the mystery behind the Sinsar Dubh and the Fae.  If I have one complaint about this book is that we get to spend too much time in Mac's head listening to her ask questions to herself.  Some of that could have been eliminated and the story would have moved forward a bit better and been tighter.<br /><br />Overall a great end to this series.  If you've been reading this series you absolutely have to read this book.  You will get answers to all your questions, you will be surprised and amazed. Moning does mention doing spin-off series in this world and I am eager to see what she comes up with next.vealed.    The pace is pretty non-stop, this is a very hard book to put down.

030746363X|5.0|I read this book slowly.  Trying to digest each chapter to get the maximum has worked for me.  I have always tried to find my own ways of diet, exercise, etc.  This book provides a groundwork to do so.  But also encourages that you track your own data and see if you can find something more efficient for yourself.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in overall physical health.  And the best part is this does not take incredible amounts of time in the gym or does it require lots of money for the food.  Very easy to implement the advice and results come rather quickly.  Thanks Tim!
B001OD6HO0|5.0|I won't go into a review of the music as that has been covered by many others under the CD edition. Let me tell you about the absolutely fabulous vinyl edition,,,<br />TOP QUALITY !!! This edition is one of the best thought out and just plain fun vinyl sets that I have purchased recently. First off it is a double disc set, 180 gram colored vinyl. Disc 1 is bright red and disc 2 is bright yellow. Glossy standard weight gate fold jacket with a nice photo on either side of Katy. Standard weight white paper sleeves for the discs. 12 tracks, just like it's standard CD counterpart are spread across the first disc, 6 tracks per side. The second disc contains 4 remixes of \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" on side one and 4 remixes of \\"Hot N Cold\\" on side two. At under the 20 dollar mark this is very much worth the money. I highly recommend this set! Also, the vinyl set of Katy Perry's other album, Teenage Dream, is also just as noteworthy with the same thought of fun and value. Please see my review for that one if you'd like to know more.<br />Thanks for reading my review!
1932100660|5.0|This is a fantastic scientifically based book. It's pretty hard to argue with such strong statistical support. It's well written and not boring even with all the science in there. I am in the 3rd chapter and wishing I had more time so I could read it faster. Worth every single penny and life changing.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|Just the thought 'Buried' should tell you how you'll feel watching this movie. It's uncomforable to watch, the entire movie. No 'on the edge of your seat' suspense, just a sick feel. There are no 'good' parts that make it worth while. You 'get' nothing new from this movie, it just reinstates negative thinking about the system. The acting was fine, but there are plenty of things I would have said differently, if I was in his shoes. (Won't say what, in case you just have to see it, no matter how many people say it's not worth it.) It's a sad movie, not one feel good moment and that is just how you feel when it's over. Start to finish, the camera never leaves the coffin. You feel ill and wishing you didn't spend your time watching it. Don't rent it for $1, spend your time watching something else.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I think this is the best one to date, can't wait to see how the next two turn out. They are going to gear it towards the adults this time around, because Bella and Edward are adults now. Just wondering how they are going to do the pregnacy. Will have to wait and see.
B000I2JKC4|3.0|Good service and quickly arrived.  Should have stated that HD DVDs do not work on regular DVD players.  Had to return it.

B00013RC9I|5.0|Each track has the unique sound of Air, but unlike some of their albums each track is distinctive while still soothing. Every track has something to offer.<br /><br />Venus is beautiful, vocals reminding me of Vesuvius on the Age of Adz.<br /><br />Run and Universal Traveler are staples on my Pandora station.<br /><br />Cherry Blossom Girl is light, sweet and romantic without being heavy in tone.<br /><br />Mike Mills had gorgeous piano, Surfing on a Rocket and Alpha Beta Gaga are catchy (they are all catchy) and upbeat.<br /><br />Another Day is a really slow track, but nothing notable.<br /><br />Biological is airy, and Alone in Kyoto is ephemeral and lovely.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Air, get this album and try them, I am sure your choice will be rewarding.<br /><br />Highly recommended, if you get one Air album let it be this one.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|It has been said over and over, but I must say it again. This is the movie of this generation. It is quite possible the most important and socially relevant film to come out in the past 20 years, and is without a doubt a contemporary classic. I cannot recommend this film enough. I found the screenplay engrossing, the score haunting, the directing first rate, and the acting by the entire cast is nothing short of astonishing. I would choose this at the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director, and even go so far as to say Best Actor for Jesse Eisenberg. His performance as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg is challenging enough, but he does it with the grace and sarcastic wit that is needed to portray the arrogant young genius. Eisenberg is always aware that he is the smartest one in the room, and his performance, in my opinion, is the performance of the year (excluding, of course, Natalie Portman in Black Swan)
B00005176F|5.0|One of the first songs that introduced me to this group was the daring and summer themed song of \\"Girls and Boys\\". Like many others, I had also heard and enjoyed \\"Song 2\\" when it had came out in the 90's. Then I was interested in getting this collection when the lead singer Damon had went on to be the lead singer in the group Gorillaz (this is especially because I enjoyed the musical tracks from the Gorillaz of \\"Feel Good\\" and \\"Dare\\"). After listening to this cd you are going to get a positive sense of why Damon Albarn was selected to be the frontman  for both the Gorillaz and Blur. Damon has a very strong and good singing voice in many of the songs. Like the Gorillaz, the music used in the Blur songs is very unique and energetic. There is the very folksy but relaxing \\"Coffee and Tv\\" track on this cd, and then there are the upbeat and fun musical numbers of \\"Country House\\", \\"Song 2\\", and \\"Tender'. \\"Coffe and Tv\\" seems to be about getting away from it all and starting over a new life. \\"Song 2\\" seems to be about letting go, but being kind of relaxed about it. \\"Tender\\" is a song about wanting to experience the strong emotion of love. I really enjoyed \\"Beetlebum\\" and \\"Parklife\\" as well. \\"Beetlebum\\" is a very catchy song about how healing someone can be to someone else with their \\"sensual\\" and \\"erotic\\" skills. \\"Parklife\\" is a musical track about taking it easy during the day and starting the day on their own terms. This greatest hits compilation is so good that I would definitely consider purchasing any future music from Blur when they release their new album (it is had been reported through the online Sun newspaper that they may do this). My overall favorite song in this collection is \\"Girls and Boys\\", which is a great fun type pop song that makes a positive statement of only sharing yourself with someone where there is a mutual attraction. A person is most likely to enjoy this greatest hits collection by Blur if:<br /> there is an interest in any songs from the Gorillaz and/or Blur,<br /> they enjoy the singing voice of Damon Albarn.z and/or Blur,<br /> they enjoy the singing voice of Damon Albarn.
0425074811|5.0|I was shopping around for this particular book and comparing prices, when I decided to purchase a \\"used\\" copy from Amazon for about three bucks. It took quite awhile to be delivered, however the book was in brand new condition and in fact seemed never to have even been opened. I'm delighted that I was able to purchase such a pristine copy for such a meager price.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|I love the series. It is the best historical show since HBO's Rome. I have a Blu-Ray player but got the DVD set instead. You ask why? Because this set is BD-Java. This means that if you stop at any point in any episode, you must start from the very beginning of he entire disk. Your Blu-Player cannot \\"remember\\" where the show was when you stopped it. This is an unfortunate by-product of BD-Java. Some Blu Ray is encoded as BD-Java and some is not. I like to be able to stop and then start at the same point on a disk again without the hassle of going through previews, warning screens and menus to find where I left off. Consequently I always avoid any BD which is BD-Java. The DVD is up-converted to 1080p anyway by my player and looks almost as good as the Blu-Ray -- without the annoyances. Great series but beware of the Blu-Ray Java inconvenience.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|This CD is really not like any of Shakira's past cd's. It's new music, it's good music.  She has a lot of diversity and I really enjoy it up to this day.  I've played it over and over.  She's very talented, I truly recommend!
B000QFW7UA|4.0|I enjoy very much this picture with young artist. they are funny. i like the Steven Spielberg touch. very relaxing picture
B004GCQ2X2|5.0|Well I know my review is old but I purchased this album on the day it came out.  I heard it over and over again!  :D  Love David Guetta!
1594488843|1.0|I agree with a previous post - don't spend money on this book.  I've found the two books of his that I read thus far to be filled with fluff. He presents interesting ideas that can be summed up in his TED presentations or watch him on YouTube.  Or if you are so inclined, check a library copy. It kind of reminds me of when you had to write a lengthy paper that you filled with factoids just to meet the page quota.  Not worth buying in my opinion.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I was really surprised.  The songs are great and the CD seems to be put together quite professionally.  I recommend this to MJ fans. Too bad we don't hear any of this stuff on Top 40 radio stations.<br /><br />I particularly liked \\"Hold My Hand\\" and \\"Monster.\\"
B001BNFR6W|2.0|The show is great.  The discs are not.  About 1 episode on almost every disc either won't play or skips and stutters.  I've tried the discs in 3 different players, so it is definitely the discs.  However, it was more than 30 days before I sat down and started watching them, so I'm not able to return them now.  Sucks for me.<br /><br />Also, the package they come in has each disc in a thick tight paper holder which will likely create scratches on the discs when inserting/removing them.  Assuming your discs are in good condition when you get them, you'll want to buy a separate DVD holder to store all of the discs.<br /><br />My advice, upon getting your discs, go through at least every disc on the 1st season, and fast forward 5-6 minutes into every show, to make sure they play.  Then you'll find out if they're bad soon enough to return them.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I watched this awesome horse win the triple crown that year.  I had never seen a horse lead so far ahead of the pack.  He had heart and it showed.  I don't think I ever watched him run a dull race it was always exciting to watch this marvelous horse.  The movie does him proud.  I've already got it on my Netflix queue to watch again.  You won't be disappointed if you get this movie.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|I just received and viewed the BluRay of this edition yesterday and I can confidently say that this is by far the best visual experience on any home theater I've ever had- bar none.   I don't feel the need to own a 3D version of this edition because I've seen that the movie CAN stand on its own even without the much hyped about 3D.   The additional scenes are amazing, and you'd actually wonder why they took those scenes away because it fleshed out the story so much more. I got to thinking maybe that's why the movie's story wasn't well-received by some critics, because of the lack of depth that the additional scenes would have put.     I haven't even finished watching the rest of the 2 discs in the collection, and I'm already recommending prospective buyers to go grab one already!   The first disc is already worth every penny. What more of the tons and tons of material on the rest of the discs?     The packaging is awesome because it comes in a beautiful book-like case wherein the discs fit right in with the pages.   No detail was overlooked in this great collection.     Don't pass the chance to own a part of movie history in your collection. This is DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Got to put im my few words about the blu-ray edition of RED. There must be a few different versions out there. People spending twelve bucks and expecting a top blu-ray release and transfer...go rent it instead! Does the phrase \\"you get what you pay for\\" sound familiar? The 'cheaper' movie only is not to be aimed at people that are into high quality, top notch blu-ray transfers. This is aimed at the people who 'just want to see the movie in other than DVD format'. This explains the single layer pressing with non-lossy audio. For a few extra bucks get the special edition and quit crying already!! You are giving this product a bad rap because you make bad choices by getting the cheapest version out there. The special edition I have is a flipper disc, which I know are trouble, with DVD on the flip-side. The blu-ray played without a glitch. Don't know if the special edition Amazon offers includes DVD or not, but I do know that the special edition is pressed at a much higher bit-rate than the cheap movie only disc. And it does include a DTS-HD soundtrack that really rocks!!! Plus it has great special features (including an all access pass).<br />So don't be mislead by the bad reviews of the movie-only edition and get this special edition and leave your brains at the door and you will have fun!<br />Enjoy!!
B004KPYQXI|5.0|This is one of the best Castle episodes in the 3 years that it has been on the air.  Well worth watching.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|The strongest part of this movie is the cast. Its really good to see this group of actors playing together and they do a good job with what they have. When you first start to watch you think the movie is a serious action movie, but you soon realize there are a lot of comedic elements to the overall story. Some are funny, especially when it involves John Malkovich, while the rest detract from the movie. Its almost like the movie cant quite figure out whether it wants to be serious or funny, and mixing the two doesn't quite work.<br /><br />The story itself is nothing special, but the talented cast does a good job with it. The special effects are pretty good, though I questioned how they made going after the vice president look so easy. Overall RED is a good movie to watch if you just want to see a decent action movie with a few laughs, but don't expect much beyond that.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|You will find yourself humming songs from this highly listenable new album all day. It contains enough of the Decemberists trademark sound to satisfy long time fans whilest being an easy entry point for those that are hearing them for the first time. There is not an album of this great band that I dislike, and The King is Dead is great music, a mix of sunny, melancholy and inspiring.    It deviates from the heavy and complex Hazards as well as their earlier albums. It is the simplest and shortest, and perhaps will disappoint those that are drawn to the epic and dark stories from Picaresque, Crane and Hazard. However, they have done exactly what they set out to accomplish, creating an addictive album fused with a nostalgic country Americana sound, that has clear shades of REM, Neil Young, and even Bob Dylan. The fact that each of their albums dares to be different and break new ground is one thing that distinguishes them from other bands out there.    I like probably 8-9 songs, but my favorites from this album are This is Why we Fight, Rise to Me, Rox in the Box, Don't Carry it All, Down by the Water and June Hymn. Ok thats half the album, but still.

030746363X|5.0|I love this book. I have been very impressed with the level of detail and research that Tim Ferris has done in order to get this book to market. With everything from how to eat better and lose weight, to how to gain weight quickly, or how to jump higher/run faster/swim better, it is really a how-to book on becoming the person you physically always wanted to be.
0385341679|5.0|This books is amazing. I read it in three days. I've never been so happy after finishing a book that I knew would end a series that I love. KMM puts in twists that you won't expect and they come out of nowhere. It's great and I honestly can sit here and sum up the whole thing but it would be so wrong to do that. So, read the book and if you haven't read the rest of the series then read those too. They are all amazing. I love KMM's writing so much that I bought a signed copy that I will cherish forever. Her other series ties into the Fever series as well. You don't have to read the other series to understand but it's just as amazing so I don't see why you wouldn't want to read it.

B0015DROBO|4.0|The first three or so chapters were hard to read becuase they were background.  Once the meat and bones of the story got started I couldn`t stop reading.  I got so involved and found myself trying to figure it out.  A great read that is worth every penny of the price.
B002ZG994U|3.0|The televison show was easy to follow.  One basic plot.  Very few twists.  And the good guys would win in the end. The movie was too complicated to follow.  If there is a second movie, I hope that it is simpler and has the humor of the televison series.
0307271862|1.0|I've heard more about Mao Tse-tung, his thoughts, policies, habits, writings, lectures, interests and even his wife in this book than anywhere else. That particular Man from Beijing should have STAYED in Beijing!<br /><br />I love the Wallander books. Mankell tells a good tale of murder most foul, intrigue and well developed characters. In The Man from Beijing, Mankell is bludgeons us with his political diatribes, after using a sensational serial murder as a vehicle to first draw us in. Plus the story line bounces around so wildly - both in time zones and time itself - that is is hard to keep track.<br /><br />I am about 75% into it. I cannot finish it. I know 'who done it' anyway.<br /><br />Back to Wallander!
B000KIPT30|5.0|I decided to purchase this little amplifier to create a volume control for my earphones directly connected to my DVD player.  I use the earphones to listen to DVDs while I exercise and the only way I could get the volume high enough in the past was to use full size headphones that included a built-in amplifier or use a full-size stereo amplifier (it's being used elsewhere).    So... I was looking for amplified earphones and found the Behringer Headphone Amp at a price considerably less than the cost of a good pair of earphones.  And I already had multiple sets of earphone that I could use.    The result is exactly as I hoped.  I can use my existing earphones and control the audio volume of the DVD.  It was necessary to add a few adapters because these 1/4\\" plugs are larger than my input or output, but that's not a surprise. Sound quality is very acceptable.     If you are going to do something similar, perhaps attaching this to independently control the volume of multiple sets of headphones or earphones for a TV, just make sure you buy or have the right adapters or cables.  Installation is quite straight forward.  Hope this helps.
030746363X|4.0|I signed up to get the book before it was released by pre-ordering for Kindle. It was duly delivered while I was on vacation giving me a lot of time to read and digest (figuratively) the book.    As with the 4-hour work week, its a great book. No book's content will be 100% applicable to anyone, and this one is no exception, but the vast majority of the book was fascinating and relevant to me. I started implementing some of the ideas immediately with some success.    What I like most about Tim's books are the practical, you-can-do-this-now, advice. So many self help/development books give you the broad theories or philosophies behind the ideas, sound fantastic, but leave you wondering, \\"OK, great, so what to I actually do when I wake up tomorrow?\\".    Well worth a read, and if you follow the sections of advice that are relevant to you, it will transform you.    Would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that here in darkest Africa, practicalities of supply and availability of \\"ingredients\\" make it difficult or impossible to follow the advice given (no access to the drugs and even bottled egg whites are unavailable).    Thanks Tim.
0385341679|5.0|This book is amazing! Simple as that. This series having 5 books (which should be read in order to fully experience the entire story) was perfect. Naturally 4 books progress and more plot builds up to the big ending, and Shadowfever did not disappoint. The few mysteries not spoken about, were resolved in the Mac's decision of not needing to know those answers. I like Mac's character because she - like everyone else in the ENTIRE world - is flawed. She flip flops from one side to another, only knowing what she has been told or has discovered and goes from there. We as the outsiders see more of what is going on because we are outsiders, but this book travels along with Mac and lets us feel and empathize what she experiences. One of the best book series I have read to date and I will continue to look for more works by this wonderful author!          *I should note that I experienced this book on audio book and was absolutely wowed by the narrator's performances! They made this 5 star book even better*
B000005RDY|5.0|Well I feel almost ashamed as a Metal fan for not having listened to this group MUCH sooner! Their music (atleast the early stuff) is phenomonal. I know it's been mentioned before that they were an influence on Metallica, and listingeing to a few songs here it's blairingly apparent why! Breadfan reminds me much of the setup for \\"Master Of Puppets\\" (though Metallica also covered this song on \\"Garage Inc.\\").        The lead singer is a bit nazally and highstrung, but considering some of the other early acts of the time (Ozzy in Sabbath) this wasn't that odd. But the guy here really can deliver lyrics in a special way. They are always exciting and clear, and often border between bizzaar and just plain creepy (\\"baby lying in a womb, are you free or in a tomb?).        If their other albums weren't all upwards of $20, you bet I'd be snatching them up too. Though I understand they fell to the deadly foe of metal that was 80s commercialism, all the stuff on this CD is solid. And for the life of me, I don't know why I \\"Aint No Mountain\\" wasn't a Billboard chart topper. It's the poppiest and most easily accessable of the  bunch. Breadfan is just a speed demon of a song, a slug fest of lyrics and guitar. Parents is, as mentioned before, epic. \\"Breaking All The House Rules\\" and \\"Hammer and Tongs\\" had a surprising blues feel to them, for a metal band, but were pretty awesome too! I highly advise any fan of metal and hard rock to pick this up! It's a true classic and a treasure!

She asked if she could borrow to watch it again.  I never got it back.  I bought another copy.  I took it to a friend's house....same story. Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat. Repeat. I now have bought seven copies.  That is a glowing recommendation.  5 stars.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|No need to review these Bourne trilogy movies, they're all great! My problem is the box set I got has a regular box with the individual cases that slide in and out. It's not the UK version which I think has a different front cover. Can anybody let me know how to get the version that comes with the box which flips open?
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Great movie from start to finish. Great cast and surprise cameos. Beautiful women, bad ass bad guys and of course, Machete! (Just don't expect a text from him, LOL). Actually has a plot and is worth while sitting through the whole movie. I loved it and love these types of films. I give it 2 thumbs up.
B00005M91K|5.0|Shows different parts of the world and people living there. Movie which makes you think about what is realy what makes us what we are? How little we need to feel good? What is important and what has no importance at all? What is the price of the technological progress?
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I love the movie and the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because Amazon has this listed as Widescreen edition and the one I received is standard. I REALLY HATE STANDARD!
B0043RSIUK|4.0|The reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is not because I don't think it is a good book, it is. I just don't think it is as good as other books Ken Follet has written. Ken Follet has this wonderful way of drawing you in to his books and presenting facts and history in a way that is interesting and easy for the average person to understand. I very much enjoyed Fall Of Giants because most historical fiction books I have read seem to be focused on WW II and I really had very little knowledge about the hows and whys of WW I. But, as much as I enjoyed learning about WW I, I found it just a little too fact heavy. I wish he had put a little more focus on the characters. This book just didn't draw me in the way Pillars of the Earth and World Without End did.     Definitely still worth the read though. Even not at his best Ken Follet is still an amazing writer. I look forward to the next two books in this trilogy.
B0000021RG|4.0|In the beginning, before Chicago became the hitmaking machine that ruled the airwaves, there was the Chicago Transit Authority.  Led by their original guitarist Terry Kath, they were as innovative a band as there was on the Rock scene of the late Sixties/Early Seventies. While they did have hits like \\"Make me Smile\\" and \\"Colour My World,\\" they also were capable of epic free-form jams. This 3 CD set is wonderful document of that band.  The original 4-LP box set came with a massive wall-sized poster of Chicago that graced the dorm rooms of every college in America.     The music in this collection embodies the original spirit and intent of the Chicago Transit Authority - a band of massive instrumental ability and wonderful vocalizing. Peter Cetera, Kath and of course Robert Lamm all turn in stellar vocals.  They were a band that could be tightly charted and tastefully arranged with top-shelf songwriting, but they could also take a piece to Mars and back with their fierce energy and free-form Jazz mentality. Even Jimi Hendrix expressed admiration of Kath's innovative techniques and abilities.    A few years later Kath would be involved in a tragic gun accident and Chicago would lose its heart and soul.  They would become the hitmaking machine that became known more as a MOR band than the musical revolutionaries they had been.  This collection, then, was the early band at its best.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Truly a family movie: if parents like it, if senior did it too, and most important, the kids, it is a family movie, loyal to the definition of such. Specially I think the facts that one of the main characters was the senior, makes this movie more unusual (and battling ageism in the society, good thing). The beginning is the senior's story, an old widower is dealing with the sense of isolation and loss, so, smaller children may have trouble to relate,as is to grown up for them. But for sure they will be taken by Kevin, the bird which is represented as very cartoonish character, humorous situations tailored to little ones naive/crude sense of humor. But Kevin is also a mother, and needs to protect her little ones, as a note about empathy. The dog will please everyone, a more complex and grown up character. And there is a story of positive transformation, and victory over the one who is a bad one. Exciting tale, teaching clear ethics too.
0465011047|5.0|An absolutely stirring and sobering story of life within the North Korean Gulag.  I read the book and finished within a week and I'm a slow reader, my wife whizzed through it in 2 days.  We were both speechless afterward.  A testimony to the human spirit and the will to survive when everyone and everything around you says otherwise.  Then President Bush was right, North Korea's Kim cult was and is truly evil.
0307463745|1.0|I am not impressed with this book. Half of it is illustrated so divide the page count.  I like entertaining illustrations when reading to my kids but when I pick up a book for myself, I want substance. It's almost as though the authors assumed that the average attention span of their readers is a few paragraphs long and that most people need frequent breaks in the form of illustrations. The book has limited amounts of substance-- some good points which require additional elaboration but most of it is  fluff  mixed with some bad language, 4 letter words and illustrations to grab your attention.  These guys are arrogant. Yes, they might have started a successful business and that is wonderful. But just as  I would not train under a doctor who has treated one or two patients successfully so I take their advice with many GRAINS OF SALT. And badmouth/pick a fight with your competition is the worst bit of advice they have to offer. Don't bother reading unless you have lots of other substance to balance it out.<br />In short, read this book if you:<br />1. Have a very short attention span<br />2. Like cool illustrations<br />3. Want to FEEL like you read lots of pages(when you really don't)<br />4. Want to understand the definition of a-r-r-o-g-a-n-t<br />5. Want some perspective based on limited experience
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Hello everyone,      Just to bring it to the attention of all region B player owners.  The version of this movie that Amazon is selling will not play on region B Blu-ray players.    I did do my research on [...] There is information there that says it is region free but this information is wrong (at least for this version of the movie anyway).    I like this movie by the way, it was my first purchase on DVD.    I hope this saves some people from making the same mistake I did.  Amazon are not to blame, they resolved my issue in less then 1 day. I love shopping for Blu-rays here and this will not discourage me from any future purchases. Just make sure you do your research before you buy.    All the best.

B002ZG999U|3.0|Good points:  They avoided making the obvious (poor) love interest choice and went instead with more of a father-daughter theme.  They also avoided the \\"one last mission\\" routine.  I left the theatre feeling like I'd just eaten a huge raw steak laden with testosterone.    Not so good:  Jet Li's constant whining and ineffectual fighting was disappointing.  The camaraderie was fun, but only some of it made much sense.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|To preface this review, please note that I do know how to sharpen...and sharpen WELL. Even my kitchen knives will not only shave but SCARE the hair from your arms. I have another pocket sharpener by Gerber that works reasonably well (for emergency field use), but this one had the rod for serrated edges so I purchased this item for a small survival kit.    Mistake...    The rod broke off during my first use. It's screwed into a plastic holder only 3/16\\" deep. No way the tiny steel threads (1/16\\" diameter) will hold in that soft plastic. The other 2 sharpening grooves are next to useless. Only if your existing bevel matches the angles of the guides PERFECTLY and the knife is very THIN will you even get an edge...and I use that term loosely.    So, for all practical intents and purposes, I bought a tapered diamond sharpening stick which I have to mount in my own handle.
1582701709|3.0|I changed after reading this book. I thought of the world differently. The concepts really opened my eyes to new possibilities, and excited that part of me that really wants to believe I have some control over situations. Some concepts presented resonated well within me (i.e. what you focus on really does become reality), but other points of the book focused too much on gaining material possession. I think this book has the possiblity to disappoint many because I don't believe if you close your eyes and imagine a new ferrari, that one will appear. I also have a hard time wrapping my brain around closing my eyes, seeing a parking space, and it appearing. I do, however, believe that with the right focus and determination we can make our dreams a reality. I just felt this book simplified the process too much in a way that is unrealistic.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Simply put, this Coen Brothers jewel is their best film ever.  I love doing Jon Polito's Giovanni Casparo aka Johnny Casper's lines with Polito's inimitable accent for my wife's amusement as often as possible.  \\"That ain't friendly kid..I come here with a decent offer and you give me the HIGH HAT!\\"  Gabriel Byrne's Tom Reagan, Albert Finney's Leo(he got the role after the actor who portrayed Nathan,Sr. in Raising Arizona passed away), John Turturro's Bernie Bernbaum(he says in the special features that he was doing an imitation of the Coen's first cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld), Marcia Gay Harden as the dame caught between Tom and Leo(and Bernie's sis), Steve Buscemi as Mink, and JE Freeman as Eddie Dane; they all are mixed into the most masterfully plotted screenplay in the history of cinema.  The film was shot on location in New Orleans, and Albert Finney was having such a good time that he dressed in drag during a pivotal scene between Harden and Byrne in a powder room after his scenes had been shot.  You MUST own this DVD!! I am waiting for an eventual blu ray release with great anticipation.  The Coen's first film, Blood Simple, is available for preorder now on bluray so maybe there is hope.

0307454541|5.0|This was a difficult read for me. I simply could not get into the characters.Yet, there has been such hullaballoo regarding this book, and received such wonderful reviews everywhere I turned, that I thought I would simply do it injustice if I did not allow myself to read it thoroughly. And so it sat in my bathroom. And yes... I read it only when going to the loo.<br /><br />And yes. I began this book well before the holidays. And yes... I did indeed read a page or two each time I went into the WC.<br /><br />But I could not get into it.<br /><br />The story began with a journalist who was going to have to do prison time for libel. And then there was cross referencing of a twenty-something punk girl who was more trouble than she was worth!<br /><br />It wasn't until last week, when I'd finally reached the mid-point of the book that suddenly I began spending more time in the john than normal! And by yesterday... well, I simply had to finish the last few chapters stretched out across my bed in a frenzy read to see what would happen next!<br /><br />Let's just say that the journalist did NOT commit libel. And this unlikely duo teams up to foil the man who caused so much grief.<br /><br />In the middle of all of this is a murder mystery, that is so twisted and contorted that you'll think your own head is turned around backwards by the time you find out the truth!<br /><br />This is a book I will revisit at a later date, and read through in just a few sittings. Yes... it's that good!<br /><br />My suggestion? If you find yourself bogged down at the beginning, read through it quickly. By the middle of the book, you will be hooked!!!<br /><br />No... I have not seen the movie yet. But I am not sure that I want to. Often times I am quite disappointed after reading a book when viewing a movie of the same because it seldoms lives up to the book. However, I'll consider it.<br /><br />I give The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo...five stars and my thumbs up award!<br /><br />Disclosure: This book was purchased by Texicanwife for private review.
030726999X|5.0|Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest / 978-0-307-59367-2<br /><br />In my reviews of [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] and [[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire]], I noted that the novels start off incredibly slowly, but if you stick with the deliberate pace and careful presentation, it's an incredible story that picks up with a rush a third of the way in. This third book in the series, by contrast, starts off with a bang from the final page of \\"Played with Fire\\", and a much faster pace is employed from the very beginning, providing the reader a fantastic ride to the satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The signature writing style of the series - slow pacing, careful presentation, and serious attention to detail - works well here in the third book of the series. The plot continues directly on from \\"Played with Fire\\" - Salander has been apprehended, and she and Blomkvist must do what they do best (she hacking, and he investigating) if they want to have any hope of acquitting Salander of false charges and exposing the government conspiracy that has literally plagued her entire life. Larsson's wonderful characterization of \\"supporting cast\\" works to a great advantage here, and it's nice to see the good police officers, intelligent agents, and online hackers working together with the protagonists to get to the truth and reveal the miscarriages of justice that have taken place. Many of the scenes with the supporting characters are pure gold and a delight to read, and the fact that the two protagonists don't hold a monopoly on talent (and morals!) makes the entire novel come alive in a very realistic way - a difficult thing to accomplish when writing a government conspiracy thriller!<br /><br />One of the things that is so skillful about this novel is how so much of the plot of the previous two books are gently referenced and (when necessary) tied up neatly, and how all this occurs very naturally within the confines of the plot. The pacing is nothing short of perfect (now that the reader is used to the slower pace in the first two novels, of course!), and there are enough scares and twists and false alarms along the way to the end to keep you on the edge of your seat without the story ever feeling gimmicky or forced. Indeed, everything from the early investigative stages to the conspiracy thriller chases to the final courtroom drama all seems to flow together in a way that always makes perfect sense to the reader - and this is from someone who usually finds conspiracy thrillers confusing to follow!<br /><br />If you've enjoyed the story of Salander and Blomkvist so far, and haven't been put off by the slow pacing and lavish attention to detail, I can almost guarantee that you will love this superb follow-up to \\"Playing with Fire\\". On the other hand, if you've been following the series without pleasure or enthusiasm, \\"Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is very similar to the previous two books, and you may find that this novel brings you no pleasure at all. If you're unsure which category you fit in, I believe every library on earth now has a copy of this series, so try it out before you buy - if you're hooked by the first 50 pages or so, you'll love the ride to the end.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollthat the reader is used to the slower pace in the first two novels, of course!), and there are enough scares and twists and false alarms along the way to the end to keep you on the edge of your seat without the story ever feeling gimmicky or forced.

0385737955|2.0|Having already put down my last 3 books in the middle, unable to finish, I was dying for a solid, sure-thing read. I'd read The Hunger Games and LOVED IT, and heard this series was similar, and after seeing pretty great reviews I bought the book. What a let down. A far cry from the Hunger Games, though the concept is quite interesting, the execution is not. I find the writing to be incredibly redundant and juvenile at best. Yes, I know this is a book intended for juveniles, but it doesn't have to feel written by one. We understand that the protagonist suffers from partial if not complete amnesia, and grapples with why he remembers some things and not others, what The Maze means, why things are the way they are. But he grapples over and over, unrelentingly, to the dismay of the reader. We get it- you are confused, you are upset. Show this in tone, in action, storyline, do not repeat OVER AND OVER the same questions 'in your mind' aka as narrative in the story. Story is just intriguing enough to keep me curious about the end of the book, so I am pushing through, knowing however that the ending probably won't make it worth my while. I'm guessing it will be some sort of cliffhanger that requires the read of the second book in the series, which I will undoubtedly NOT be doing. Take home message: read Hunger Games instead. If you already have, save yourself $10 and a few hours by not reading this book.
0061997811|5.0|I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas and I was so amazed with all that it included I was misty eyed.  Not only is it a page by page insight on the collaboration that went into transforming the books into reality but it has life and near to live size prop replicas inside!  Some I had never seen before!  Nothing beats the Marauder'a Map.  I had tried to purchase this item, at a rather obscene figure for such a thing, but it was forever out of stock.  When I found a more than comparable replica inside the book I was so excited.  Among the other items was a Letter from Hogwarts, copy of the Quidditch World Cup program, a Ministry of Magic pass book, potion label stickers (true to size), tickets to the Yule Ball, a Weasley's Wizard Wheezes catalog, Honey Dukes punch out box, Borgin and Burkes catalog and a nice set of Umbridge's Proclamations (smaller than life).  The book also has a pull out of the Black Family Tapestry and a break down of the Black family tree.  After all of the goodies the reading has lots of great insights as to how each character and scene were created the way they were by the people who created them.  The actors also have some mention as to their input over character costumes.  Lots of concept sketches and notes to pour over.  You will never regret paying the price for this book because it will definitely be a coveted book if it should ever go out of production!
B002ZG97E2|5.0|Not the simplistic if hilarious battle between a couple of wacky super villains the advertising suggested.  Not that this battle isn't there in all its hysterical glory, but that isn't what the movie is truly about.  Up until now if you wanted computer animated movies with \\"heart\\", your best bet was to go with Pixar or, lately at least, DreamWorks, but with this spectacular debut Illumination Entertainment may be poised to duel with the titans of this industry.<br /><br />After a hilarious opening reveals the theft of the Great Pyramid, the movie focuses in on Gru (a voice acting tour de force by Steve Carrell), super villain extraordinaire, going through his normal morning evil routine, until rudely interrupted by the news that he has been topped in spectacular villainy by the upstart Vector.  When said Vector spoils Gru's plans for topping his pyramid theft by stealing from Gru the Shrink Ray he just stole in order to steal the Moon, a desperate Gru decides to acquire the only force capable of penetrating the Fortress of Vectortude:<br /><br />three orphan girls selling cookies door to door.<br /><br />What follows is the joys and agony of parenting I was talking about as Gru's coldblooded, calculated plans to manipulate and use the three little girls for selfish purposes is slowly and unwillingly transformed into something else.  Oh, it is obvious that we, the audience, are being manipulated, too, but it is done in such a spectacularly over the top fashion that we cannot truly take offense.<br /><br />Even without the three little girls, the sympathies of the audience could only be with Gru.  Besides the nasty little secret later revealed about him, Vector is the quintessential spoiled rich kid in contrast to Gru's working class super villain.  An unremarked but telling difference between the two is that Gru's evil at least has some sort of purpose, some sort of point to it.  Gru intends to hold the Moon for ransom; in contrast Vector appears to have no reason whatsoever for stealing the Great Pyramid, not even \\"because it was there.\\"<br /><br />Note: This movie is sometimes packaged with a bonus DVD, containing three shorts: \\"Home Makeover\\", \\"Orientation Day\\", and \\"Banana\\", which impress by all being spectacularly good!  (I've gotten used to being disappointed by these extra straight-to-DVD computer animated shorts.)  \\"Home Makeover\\", the only one starring the three girls along with the scene-stealing Minions, which feels almost like a lost scene cut from the movie, chronicles the hilarious emergency childproofing of the Gru residence before inspection by a social worker.  The Minions only \\"Orientation Day\\", which satirizes the infamous new hire orientation film, and \\"Banana\\", which takes \\"snack attack\\" to completely insane levels, are equally great.<br /><br />I would LOVE to see a sequel, and more importantly I would trust these people to produce a great one.Pyramid, not even \\"because it was there.\\"    Note: This movie is sometimes packaged with a bonus DVD, containing three shorts: \\"Home Makeover\\", \\"Orientation Day\\", and \\"Banana\\", which impress by all being spectacularly good!

0060558121|2.0|Wasted a few hours of my life reading this.<br /><br />Things you have to know before buying this book.<br /><br />1) The main characters name is \\"Shadow.\\"  Seriously.  He tells people his name is \\"Shadow\\" and nobody bats an eyelash.  I kept waiting for someone to do a spit-take but it never happens.  His name is Shadow.  Oh, and his wife nicknames him \\"Puppy.\\"  So if you can stomach your main character being addressed alternatingly as either \\"Shadow\\" or \\"Puppy\\" you're in good shape.<br /><br />2) The \\"Gods\\" referred to in the book are the lameset bunch of sad-sacks you will ever read about.  They are mortal (in the sense they can be killed with a gun or run over by a car) although they don't age and they look like normal people (some are tall, some are pretty, some are old, some are young).  So what makes them Gods you ask?  Well, they are good at coin-tricks and some of them can hypnotize people.  That's it.  Seriously.  Odin, the father of all Greek Gods has the amazing powers of being able to hypnotize girls into sleeping with him and passing bad checks.  No joke.  That's it.  Why anyone would have ever prayed to these \\"Gods\\" in the first place God only knows (pun intended).  They are so lame and boring, it's really terrible.<br /><br />3) You seriously will not care about a sinle character in this book.  I didn't care if the main character lived or died.  I just wanted SOMEONE to do SOMETHING interesting.  Never happens.  Although towards the end things get really retarded and \\"Shadow\\" gets tied to a tree and dies?  But then starts riding a giant bird around? But it might have been a dream?  Who knows.<br /><br />4) Ahh who cares.  I've already wasted too much time reading the thing, why waste more writing about it?  Do yourselves a favor, read something else.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Needed something to boost the sound from my HD TV while using headphones. Because we live in an apartment, plus my wife sleeps during the day (works the graveyard shift), I sometimes use headphones when watching movies so as not to disturb anyone. But the volume isn't loud enough to give the soundtrack the usual punch I like while watching. This amp is AWESOME!! Plenty loud and very clear sound. No distortion. Great buy for so small and cheap!! Unfortunately my TV doesn't have an audio bass and treble control, so I wish it had a bass boost, but that's OK. It still sounds great!
B004EC5IV6|5.0|The english dub just isn't as well executed in this movie than in the original series while the japanese sub is. That said, this film blew me off my feet. I didn't find the first movie very good, plus it didn't really change from the original series besides having updated graphics and effects. Conversely you can not advance stays true yet departs from the original series in a way that is incredibly appealing, fresh, and innovative. I watched 5 times in a three day period. This movie really does recreate the spark of the original but creates new feelings of the same light and intensity as well. Old fan, new viewer, intellectual, or anime lover you will love this adaptation. It screams everything that is possible to do right with a film. Its simply brilliant.
1439107955|5.0|Reading this book brought back memories of world history courses that tried to trace back the root of WWI or II. Only the most thoughtful of writers -- part historian, part sociologist, part political strategist, and part economist -- could begin to do the topic any justice. So it is that Dr. Mukherjee is the medical analog of these great war and presidential biographers.     Being a \\"nontraditional\\" student of medicine who arrived in this career later in life, I was both heartened and relieved to see a disease be positioned so differently from the way we learn of cancer in class and even in the media -- to be assessed as intimately and comprehensively as a president or prime minister in one highly accessible biography. Thus, first and foremost, this is a review of praise and gratitude for giving new students of medicine like me the chance to trace the roots of many of the cancer-related debates we hear today. Furthermore, the vividness of the story makes it all the more memorable -- and leaves me certain that Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee has followed in the footsteps of \\"Four-Button Sid\\" by bringing to the average twenty-first century citizen some clarification and context that the disease/lifestyle of cancer so desperately needs. It is this kind of thought-provoking and honest recount that can focus not just doctors and scientists but entire societies on the most effective form of education, fundraising, and personal care that can allow progress in avoiding and treating cancer.     To further praise its applicability to life, this book gives an unexpectedly generous amount of time to the debate over mammography -- a debate which even in 2011 still rages on and one which is just igniting in other countries. In my global health work, I found this discussion to be particularly helpful in understanding the different arguments for/against breast cancer screening at various ages.    Personally, I tend to be less worried about things once I learn about them, even if they maybe inevitable. Rather than instilling fear, Dr. Mukherjee's tracing of the genetic and biological causes of cancer, and as importantly his recount of how others have battled it physically and politically, actually calmed the storm cloud over my head. I expected to feel dread and sadness, but throughout my read, I more often felt empowered and enlightened, especially as I better understood the social trends that delayed progress against cancer.    I would also like to add that I have read many of the other reviews on this website, and must say that I agree it would have been wonderful to have had an extra hundred pages at the end detailing the biochemical advances of the past few years. However, this is mainly because it would have served my purposes as a student of science and (hopefully) a future doctor. These reviewers should consider that there are many more out there whose skillset lies in other careers, and for whom this detail might be tiresome, confusing, or even misguiding. I can only imagine how carefully someone battling cancer (in themselves or a loved one) would read those sections, and may unduly rely upon them for their own treatment. Certainly, there is a void for this kind of comprehensive current information (just like the void in cancer biographies that Dr. Mukherjee wanted to address), but I leave it to the reader to consider whether perhaps these are two different voids, two different audiences, and should be contained in two separate texts. (I for one would read that sequel voraciously, especially if written by Dr. Mukherjee!)
B003EYVXUU|3.0|Essentially, this is a pre-digested version of the Swedish original.  All the 'money shots' from the first film are replicated here, while the story is trimmed down--with many supporting characters simply absent.    The pace is ramped up a bit too much, and the soundtrack is just out of control.  The tone and burn of the original is simply lost here.  All due to the actors: the American cast is fine here, but the entire production staff succeeded in puking up a zero-calorie version of a great foreign-language film.    Rent, don't buy.

B000002MG1|5.0|I've been listening to REM since its pre-Murmur days. So it's been a while. To me, this is REM's magnum-opus, a \\"concept album\\" that doesn't fall flat on its face like most such recordings but quite the contrary. The music is entrancing and diverse, the lyrics are thought-provoking and, in a few documented cases, life-saving. Others have already written quite convincingly glowing reviews about this remarkable album. I wish to add this:<br /><br />I own a couple of thousand of CDs and a stable of basses, amps, and accessories. I try to listen to all music that strikes me as unique and, thus, the collection. I became a professional musician because I saw what one can do with intelligent rock. I wanted a piece of that experience; without REM, I would have lacked the motivation to work so hard. Yes, y'all, REM is nothing short of inspiring.<br /><br />The band indeed inspired a generation of young musicians, to which I belong(ed), to compose deceptively simple songs, with sincere-but-never cloying lyrics. My bands opened for countless major acts and it was all very nice: Opening for REM was the greatest experience I ever had as a musician. The band sparked a revolution: It made serious rock cool again; it was time for that and most of us are greatly, unabashedly indebted.<br /><br />This album is a masterpiece. It presents REM at its tightest, most introspective (but not pompous--tough feat), and lyrically and melodically powerful. It impressed my fellow \\"college rockers\\" the most for the reasons mentioned above: We played it over and over in the tour-bus, until our normally patient driver yelled that he was either going to switch the CD or drop us off somewhere dark and scary. There is not a weak song on this album, not in any way. Stipe and crew take all who have ears and musical intelligence embedded betwixt them on a stark-yet-very-human tour of our universal yearnings, experiences, regrets and ride toward self-acceptance.<br /><br />Very few bands manage to capture the tenets of high-brow positive existentialism (e.g., Alfred Adler, Irvin Yalom) without alienating their audiences with bloated pseudo-intellectualism. This one makes it to home-base with enough change to feed any meter. It's the most humbling album I've ever heard and I have been a touring and recording bassist for most of my adult life. There are no flashy pyrotechnics here, thank God: There is great beauty. Show me a rock album that surpasses this one and I will sell all my gear...cheap.the tenets of high-brow positive existentialism (e.g., Alfred Adler, Irvin Yalom) without alienating their audiences with bloated pseudo-intellectualism.

0316098337|4.0|To keep it short and sweet:  I loved this book.  I thought the author captured the voice, mind, thoughts, and perspective of a 5 year old boy extremely well.  She told the story from his point of view, but allowed us, the readers, through our adult vantage points to see what he couldn't see.  We saw his life from his mother's point of view, even though he was the one telling the story.  It was amazing.  This book made me feel happy, upset, disturbed, sad, and powerful all at the same time.  I'd say that's something worth reading.

1594202842|1.0|I cringed (not chuckled) as I listened to the author read this book, choosing the audio version, so there could be no debate about her intended voice as she spoke the words. I imagined what  living with this woman was like, and I was haunted by her words, \\"I don't know how to have fun\\", and thought to myself now she wants to make sure that no one else in her family does either!.  In some states, what she did to her children has to be considered illegal and absolute emotional child abuse. Does she attempt humor in the book? Yes, but it falls flat against the backdrop of the emotional abuse of her children. She takes comfort that after she abuses them they hug her, seeking out love from the abusive parent, while the husband does nothing to stop the abuse.<br /><br />She boasts that the children never took a day off from piano practice, even when sick with a fever or after oral surgery (she just shoves painkillers at her daughters and commands them to practice). After playing piano for hours and hours one day, one daughter was hungry for dinner at 5:30PM.  Mommy dearest responds with  \\"no, no dinner until 9:00PM because you must practice for hours more.\\"  I suppose if the societal challenge was escape from the gulag, her extreme parenting would help toughen us up for the challenge. But this portrait of the childhood she stole from her daughters is pathetic.  She is so narcissistic and delusional:  she has convinced herself that she does this all for her childrens' benefits. You won't be fooled though when you hear her description of the room at the St. Regis and the food and the bussed in friends.  She is so transparent. When she states \\"we gave up the violin\\", you know you've met this type of lunatic parent before.  Can you imagine Michael Phelps's mother saying \\"we gave up swimming\\"?  This is what did it for me: When grandmother begged for one single day, just one whole day, to spend with her granddaughters, this mother (the author) did not allow it. The grandmother is now dead--no more wasted days with Grandma--off to more piano practice.<br /><br />She tries, unconvincingly, to show her \\"softer\\" side toward her dogs, but when a mother is willing to endlessly berate and dominate her children year after year after year, do we really care that she was \\"low key\\" as a dog owner? She is so unlikeable as a human being that by the end of the book if you had asked me to choose between being stuck in an elevator for 3 hours with Amy Chua or Glenn Beck, I would choose to endure Glenn Beck.  The frightening aspect of this book is that the mother couldn't see that she actually put her younger child at real risk--if the book had ended in the child's suicide, you would honestly have said to yourself, \\"well I could see that coming\\".  Thank God the child liberates herself from her mother with no more damage than a bad haircut and bad memories.<br /><br />As far as Western parenting, you can set high standards and high expectations without emotionally abusing your children. I'll take our Western parented outcomes of Steve Jobs, Jon Stewart, Michael Phelps, Hilary Clinton, and Sonja Sotomayer any day over her control freak, abusive parenting.  These high achievers all had lots of fun and play in their lives, and they likely all had some \\"whole days\\" with their grandmas.ead--no more wasted days with Grandma--off to more piano practice.

I don't really see an end in sight.
0553805371|3.0|I am a Hawking fan ever since I have so eagerly read and listened the paper/audio books of his 'The Briefer History of Time.' But this time for The Grand Design, my pleasure of reading it has been delayed until the very end but still not quite yet there. I feel the book is quite like an introductory, popular science book rather than an in depth texts for someone who keeps interested in tracking the subject of Big Bang and General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics  and Unified Theory... The book spent too much chapters to comb through the ancient cognition of the origin of the Universe that almost everyone is familiar with. When it finally starts to touch the M Theory that I am so excited to learn more about, it just stopped without enough information for a decent understanding of the subject. And The Grand Design's argument is not quite convincing as it is not even developed before the conclusion is suddenly drawn. Well, I guess I need to find other further readings to fill in the blank. Well, if you don't raise your expectation of this book as high as before your reading of the History of Time Series, then you will still quite enjoy this one.

0316042994|4.0|Charles Ryder, an English soldier, arrives in the middle of the night at the new home of his troops.  They are to be stationed at an old country estate.  When Charles awakens the next morning, he is surprised to find that he recognizes the place--it is Brideshead, a place with which he was very familiar during his college days.  His best friend's family lived there, and Charles descends into memories of the friendship and the collapse of his friend's family.    Sebastian Flyte is unlike anyone Charles has known.  He is glamorous and cultured, moody and outrageous.  He meets Charles accidentally in their first year at Oxford, and the two become nearly inseparable.  Charles is dazzled by his friend and, despite Sebastian's irritation, he ends up becoming close to the rest of the family, too.  Sebastian's father is living abroad in scandal with his mistress.  Sebastian's mother is at home, clinging to her Roman Catholic faith and worrying about her children.  Sebastian's older brother is proper and largely disapproving of Sebastian, but his two sisters love him a great deal.      Every member of the family is affected by their Catholic upbringing, and they are fascinated by Charles, who is an atheist.    As Sebastian begins to feel smothered by his family, he starts drinking heavily.  The more he drinks, the more his family tries to keep him under control, to pull him back to the family fold, and this ends up pushing him even more quickly into alcoholism.    In the second part of the book, Charles examines his relationship with Sebastian's sister, Julia, and the two of them observe as the family completely disintegrates.    I really liked the intricate examination of the family, and the ways they interacted with each other, and also the ways that they presented themselves in society.  I liked Charles and Sebastian's relationship in the first part of the book, and the ways they balanced each other.  I also really liked Charles' father and the quiet war they fought whenCharles came home from college penniless for his vacation.    In the second part of the book, it was much more difficult for me to relate to or to like Charles very much.  He'd descended into someone so shallow, who was only interested in his own pleasures and ambitions, and who abandoned his family for little reason.  Julia, also, became annoying, especially toward the end when she was rediscovering her faith.  The characters, so bright and lively at the beginning of the story, became duller toward the end.
0618526412|5.0|This book envelopes you with a richly woven character development driven story. The author's ability to tap into the baseline of all humanity is stunning. The people in this book come alive to engage the reader in all sorts of questions about human nature including death, injustice, despair, poverty and the struggle to find meaning in ordinary everyday life. Despite this weight,it was an uplifting tale.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|ABSOLUTE WORST MOVIE I have EVER forced myself through.  A guy in a box.  OK, A buried coffin.  Either way, that is the movie.  Him in the box succumbing to fear. Who wouldn't.  You're buried alive.  He does what any person would do, freak out.  He also does what most people know not to do.  Make deals with terrorists.  They never keep their end of the deal, so why would you even consider it?  Its a frustrating film that only makes you wish you could go back in time and tell yourself to save the time and money and clean the gutters or re-organize your bills instead. At least you would know that the agony would pay off in the end.  I don't want to spoil the film for anyone,.. oh wait.  I already did.  Its about a guy in a box, freaking out, making deals with terrorists.  At least it ended realistically.  Fortunately, after dragging myself through this \\"movie\\", I was actually able to finish watching \\"Hobgoblins\\" (1988).       My Advice,  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Some call the movie \\"cerebral\\" (bull), or \\"thrilling\\" (for like 1 whole minute at exactly the middle of the movie), or even \\"suspenseful\\" (which I must agree as you are thoroughly in suspense for the movie to finally end), but I call it \\"a big waste of time\\", \\"agonizingly boring\\", and \\"mind-shatteringly ridiculous\\"! I'd give it '0' stars if I could.

B002ZG997C|2.0|I hesitated watching this film for dread that it would be some pseudo-religious mind screw, and was right. It's only redeeming qualities are Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and a few blood and gore action scenes. The setting of the film is in the near future. Because of the division that religion creates, holy books (more specifically the Bible) have been gathered up and destroyed to prevent war, but alas, it is too little, too late. The world has become a post-apocalyptic nightmare, devastated by nuclear war. The earth is scorched, the atmosphere desiccated, and the planet is a now a barren desert. Small groups of humans struggle to survive among the ruins of the cataclysm. However, there seems to be hope. Among the survivors is a King James Bible and apparently only one black man, Eli. In what seems to be a weird paradoxical effort, Eli is trying to save the very book that has caused the destruction of the world and almost the extinction of mankind.  The film does a decent job of revealing why holy books were written and used in the first place. Ancient peoples were in constant danger of being invaded or subjugated by other tribes and armies. They lived in continual fear of being annihilated and their culture destroyed and forgotten. There was always a threat, always an impending apocalypse which would drive men to fear and to reject others and commit horrible acts, much like you see in the film. We see the residual of this ingrained fear in those that embrace and believe ancient text today. Carnegie (Gary Oldman) seems to understand this and wants this power to create nationalism and loyalty for his purposes.  Mankind has evolved to the point that they give imagination to their fears. It is man's ingrained fear of death and therefore his urge to conquer it that drives them. Men proselytize not to save others but to save themselves. Their fear of \\"different\\" drive men to convert everyone to their own beliefs and culture, then they believe they will finally be safe.Quoting only \\"nice\\" verses of the Bible throughout the film, Eli reveals himself to be some self-proclaimed \\"book savior\\". I would have loved to have seen the faces of the people around Eli when he quoted these verses:   \\"But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own d_ng, and drink their own p_ss with you?\\" (Isaiah 36:12; 2 Kings 18:27)   \\"For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh (gen_tals) is as the flesh (genit_ls) of asses (donkeys), and whose issue (s_men) is like the issue (sem_n) of horses.\\" (Ezekiel 23:20)   You should read the above verses in a modern translation to get the full disgusting impact of them. Moralists have censored and banned books for far less than these verses. For example, \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" was banned for containing the word \\"wh_re\\". The Bible (KJV) uses this word 15 times and the word \\"harl_t\\" 90 times. The Bible is filled with violence, murder, gore-filled bloodshed, suicide, pornography, misogyny, body mutilation, incest, pedophilia, genocide, racism, rape (including being raped to death by the men of a city), cannibalism (including boiling and eating their own baby), and many other terrible acts that I would not be allowed to write here. Many of these acts are portrayed in a positive and accepted manner of behavior. Yet, many people will give their children this book without the thought of what it contains. If theses stories were written in another book, these same people would condemn it.   \\"And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but COULD NOT drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.\\" - (Judges 1:19) \\"...all things are possible with God.\\" - (Mark 10:27) Have you ever noticed how absurd, contradictory and illogical religious text can be. Yet, many people rarely, if ever, notice these contradictions, nor want to.   The film embraces this sense of contradiction and leaves you with a feeling of \\"here we go again\\". You are left to make up your own mind. Is Eli a Savior or the Angel of Death?

It goes without saying that this book is \\"different\\" from the Kite Runner, it's equally true to say this is another well written and engaging book via the author.  Without going into details, all who enjoyed the Kite Runner will likewise enjoy this book, perhaps not to the same extent, but all will enjoy it.  For those who have read neither book, just get both of these books and prepare to be inspired and moved.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|This 1930s era story centers around 3 adopted orphans. Each has ambition and a life desire. Don't let the title fool you. Very little is truly about ballet. The story is their struggle to grow up and achieve their heart's dream. It works well for a story from a book, although the children are a bit older in the film compared to the book. It hurts nothing. Well acted by young actresses, but it is the other, adult acting that caught my eye.<br /><br />What a wonderful look at some very famous British film/TV/theater stars. They help this story immensely. No upstaging, just wonderful characters played very realistically. They make this period story divine. And costuming wonderful, from common wear to actress elaborations.<br />SUBTITLES included.

B001GCUO5M|3.0|1. I know the end of the movie is just a small percentage of the film, but... it's the end;  it obviously brings the whole film together and thus it was a huge let down / dissapointment when at the end (well, you'll have to watch it... or just perhaps skip this film).  Other than the end, which makes the entire film illogical, the writing / acting was excellent.  But again, once you're done with the film, you'll be asking yourself \\"what's the point of the film?\\"
0312117337|4.0|Beautiful illustrations that will speak to your heart. Great way to shed light on an issue. The cards have a silky feel that delights the touch. The reason I gave only four stars is that, to me, the cards should have been perhaps called oracle or divining cards instead of trying to relate them to the traditional tarot. The suits have been changed, which can boggle the mind when you are trying to look them up, and looking them up can be a pain. These cards are better used free form. Forget that they are supposedly based on Tarot, expand your mind and enjoy the beauty of these cards. Definitely buy them!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|1.  I watched this a while ago and thus it's a bit fuzzy in my memory, but the bottomline is that it's a well made film, decent acting, decent writing and nothing offensive, making a good family film.
1572814136|4.0|I really like the vibrancy of these cards. So far, my favorite deck. The only problem I'm having with them is the slickness of the cards. Super slick and utterly uncontrollable. I don't have this problem with any of my other cards; they are all on the silky side. I keep shuffling and handling them to see if I can wear off some of the finish, but no luck yet.
0316017922|5.0|This is my first book of Malcolm Gladwell's to read, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I feel that he does an excellent job of taking dry sociological subject matter and packaging it into a concise, thought-provoking book. The book is filled with interesting anecdotes with unexpected twists that make you rethink ingrained concepts such as \\"raw talent\\" and achieving without anyone's help.    My biggest regret is Gladwell points out flaws in social systems, such as the education system, that an individual is often too small and inconsequential to remedy. If more people of influence and power would read \\"Outliers\\" and be willing to experiment with slaughtering some sacred cows, we might see some amazing results.

B002ZG981E|3.0|Is this movie original?.. yes.  Does it keep your attention?... yes.  Is it one of the best movies ever made?... not by a long shot.  The acting was pretty good, the story original, but for several reasons I think this is a glorified over-rated movie.  Whenever a movie seems hard to follow, which this movie is meant to be, people automatically think it is deep and complex, which classifies it as a stimulating movie.  Not the case here.  I found it rather annoying and far-fetched.  For one thing, hooking yourself up to what looks like a futuristic cappuccino machine, does not allow you to enter another person's dream.  This device is so under explained and so ridiculous, it forms a huge hole in the movie plot.  Of course if you want to turn off your brain, which 98% of people do while watching big Hollywood movies do, then you will blindly ignore this and go on believing this BS.      I really thought this movie had a refreshing vibe to it in the way it explored dreams, the concept of time being warped while dreaming, the ability to control a dream environment, and the consequences of dying while dreaming.  But due to the excessive gunfights and explosions, the story became generic to me. The story also seemed to contradict itself.  First you go to a never-ending abyss by dying in a dream while being heavily sedated, but the only way you can escape the abyss is by ending your life.  This idea is vague and contradicting.  At least `The Matrix' had a much more solid concept that if you die in the Matrix, you die in reality, which was by far a much better movie.    The movie's ending is cheesy and under dramatic.  Leo gets to see his children's faces.. so what? To me \\"Shutter Island\\" was a much better movie, which also starred Leo and also explores alternative planes of reality and has a fantastic surprising ending.  This movie's ending is predictable and obvious, leaving no twists or having the audience thinking \\"Oh, now it all comes together\\".
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Scott Pilgrim vs the world was by far the best movie of 2010.  It combined comic and movie to make a superbly awesome movie.  The lighted effects were awesome, the character dialog was awesome, and the action that the movie provided was amazingly old school game action.<br /><br />The love story (yes there is a love story behind everything) was not overpowering and not to mild to detect.  The character grows throughout the movie and starts to realize more and more about himself.<br /><br />I think I will laugh just as hard the next time I watch this movie as I did the first.  If you are not a geek in any way, and you don't like old game development please stay away from this movie.

0060936223|5.0|Two young people trying to make it big in the art world -- interesting to me as I am of the era that the main part of the story is about -- the late 60s early 70s -- it is a true love story, in the true sense of love -- these two people truly loved one another, and throughout their entire lives (the author is still alive) they were always kind, thoughtful, and had the other person's best interest at heart -- they intuitively understood each other, which they both knew that no one else did -- very rare emotional support of each other, always --

B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|This is some of Kanye's Best Work (if not his Best.) Not yet ready to give it a instant classic just yet though. It isn't predictable, if find it weird how people judge the individual more so then the music itself. People's review reflect what they think and how they feel about Kanye as a person. That has very little to do with the actual album. Yes he's the person who music it it but people please write review about the album and not your feelings and opinion of the man.     With that being said I would like to comment on Kanye as an artist and the comments in regards to why people don't consider him a genius: People PLEASE,........ Everyone keeps saying that Kanye ISN'T a Genius, but clearly he is. Let me elaborate, he gets the genius tag so often because he's the total package. Tell me another single person who not only has dope lyrics but has the talent and ability to create dope tracks. Usually it's either one or the other not both. He has the ability to create both. He uses \\"double entendre\\" better than most people would understand let along appreciate. If you're a true hip-hop/rap fan you know that not EVERY bar is going to be perfect. If you think it's so simple and sooooo easy, then PLEASE make a valid attempt to write 16 bars and see how you're able to maintain a consistent line, for line, for line level of cleverness and whit. Just his ability to recognize and position certain samples and make them sound great in a song is genius. It's like taking a Michael Jordan or Kobe and surrounding them with key role players; you're destined for greatness. The only thing that I disagree with in regards to Kanye is him saying that he's a genius, the tag is something that has to be bestowed upon you and not self proclaimed.
B002GMNLKQ|5.0|When a genre becomes so saturated with bands plying their wares only the truly great stand out amongst the throngs.  Insomnium are one of those bands who constantly stand out. Along with Be'lakor they put so much meaning and emotion into their songs they draw the listener in completely.   Their sound is heavily influenced by Opeth (in their heavier moments) but they also have their own flavour.  'Down With the Sun' is easily one of the best songs I have heard. Ever.  Not much more can be said but bring out more albums.
0393072231|5.0|If you want a good read that makes your blood boil, read The Big Short!  I'm a well seasoned Sr. Financial Advisor, and when I read this book, I wanted to see the creators of all this sub-prime financial carnage hang from the gallows, and still do.

030746363X|4.0|I still often say to myself, \\"No way, that can't work, really?!\\" when I hear of Tim's new plans or prescriptions.  I'm above-average fit anyway, but I've followed for years the typical guidance with regard to caloric intake and exercise.  I've started just a few of Tim's 4HB ideas and already can tell a difference.  Also, though the book is BIG, it's EASY to read but jam-packed with high-value stuff.  Tim just produced another GREAT product in which he conveys a TON of great stuff in a very digestible way.  And there's humor throughout.  Go to Barnes and Noble to the sports section and see what you find.  Some motivating pictures plus dry, standard guidance text . . . the 4HB will crush these books and you'll be super glad you read and implemented Tim's new, motivational, and exciting techniques. - Caleb

1400052173|5.0|Let me just say it:    The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an amazing book.    There are books that entertain, amuse, educate, philosophize, dictate, subvert, divert, interest, and/or bore. This book transcends all those categories. This book will change your world.    For me, it changed the way I understood Science--with a capital S. Science is oft referred to as today's reigning religion. The scientific method, process, and philosophy undergird much of the way we approach knowledge and the world around us. Science is neat, methodical, objective. It is safe, controlled, and above all, ethical. Or so I thought, as a Biology major.    This book turned that all around. The Immortal Life of Henrieta Lacks is about many things: the enigma that is Henrietta Lacks, the scientific revolution sparked by the first ever cultured immortal human cell line (HeLa), the story of a family's quest for truth, and the injustices done upon the Lacks family. For me, this is also the story of Science and its dirty beginning.    Rebecca Skloot is an excellent story-teller with an excellent story. Gripping, horrifying, shocking, revelatory--The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks should not be missed by anyone. Get it at the bookstore, get it on your kindle, get it at the library. One way or another. Get it. You will not regret it.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This movie caught our eye when it was in the theater.  The list of actors is very impressive.  These are actors who can each make a movie, and there are a lot of them.  The idea of the movie, retired people coming back to work their jobs, is alluring to the baby boomers who are retiring in droves.  And lots of guns and action is what movies are so very good at. Somehow, we never did end up seeing the movie in the theater, in part due to some lukewarm reviews.  Well, those reviews were wrong.       The movie starts with Bruce Willis talking on the phone about his Social Security check to a young woman at SS.  All of a sudden he is facing assassins.  And it goes on from there.  He recruits his old co-workers to help him.  In the process of dealing with high tech bad guys trying to kill him, a great time is had by all.  There's lots of shooting the bad guys, but somehow, we don't think about that.  This is not a transcendental film, just a great good time.  There is lots of comedy and action.  Get this DVD, play it on the biggest screen you have, and bring on the popcorn.
0385523912|5.0|The irony of the title of Barbara Demick's moving book, Nothing to Envy is of course that North Korea--where children were taught a nationalist song \\"We Have Nothing to Envy in This World\\"--itself possesses nothing at all to envy, nothing to support the heady propaganda of the Socialist state in acute decline. What was once a jewel in the Socialist crown has steadily and rapidly fallen into a hellish manifestation of a ruling dynasty's eccentric, deadly desires--a regime ill equipped to deal with the fall of the Soviet Union and its attenuating ramifications for former patron states.    But Demick's book steers clear of political rhetoric in favor of realist individualistic depictions of \\"real lives in North Korea.\\" Her precise descriptions and renderings of North Korean families over a long period of time create a narrative momentum that grips the reader in an emotional and gut-wrenching pull. The recurring theme of North Korean lives from the early 1990s onward is the quest for basic food. Kim Jong Il's denial of the famine cost the lives and suffering of untold millions. A simple dish of white rice--once the basis of Kim Il Sung's Communist rule--by the 1990s under Kim Jong Il becomes an unfathomable luxury.    The dire conditions of ordinary North Koreans is one of the world's greatest tragedies, and I cannot imagine a more powerful book to bring the realities of this complex issue into the light. In 2009, Demick told The New Yorker: \\"Any glimpse of the outside world is corrosive to the regime's hold over the population. When North Koreans watch soap operas, especially South Korean soap operas, and see ordinary people in kitchens with microwaves and gas stoves, refrigerators filled with food, they realize everything they've been told is untrue. They do have something to envy.\\"
B000UPSKO8|4.0|Anna Netrebko is always superlative. Having said that this DVD is not as overwhelmingly stupendous as is the Berlin concert.     There is nothing wrong with the singing of the many popular arias.

Compare the final item on both concerts and you will see and feel what I mean.    Anthony Robinson

1595825045|5.0|If you like the show you'll love this book.  I only wish the pictures were bigger and there were more of them.  Twice the length would've been great.  It starts with the concept art and works it's way through the series by episode, with about two pages devoted to each episode.  This is why I think it should have been a longer book; two pages isn't enough to capture the depth of an episode, especially some of the more important ones.  Avatar is such a rich world, and there isn't a second that's wasted in an episode, so I would've liked to see more.  However, these are minor complaints.  The book is fantastic.

081297381X|5.0|An author whose contemporaries include British historian, Niall Ferguson, and whose mathematical background includes partial apostolic succession of Benoit Mandelbrot, who is famous for his geometry of fractals, Taleb cites that there are too many in the social sciences who abuse the most advanced mathematics and thus create global catastrophes as a result.    From calculus to Laplacian mechanics to contemporary discrete mathematics, the highly evolved technical specialties, according to Taleb, are improperly used by so-called experts who attempt to relegate the data so as to fit within the normal distribution curve and thus make predictions regarding the future, especially in the world of finance. From the most primitive pattern formations to the most advanced computers, technological advancements have helped to reap gains in scientific knowledge but have often failed to signal when and when not to rely upon inductive reasoning and whether or not to proceed upon the myriad hypotheses that have been created in result.    What Taleb identifies as often running counter to what is both interpolated and extrapolated from the bell curve are what he calls the black swans. The black swans are those rare, but highly significant occurrences or data values that are outside the regular boundaries of the bell curve or as Malcolm Gladwell might put it, the outliers that, though not frequent, can make a significant impact upon society. Taleb, in essence, stresses that improbable is often misconstrued as impossible, and that is where many problems start as a result of refusing to acknowledge any likelihood of rare occurrences.    Among the complications is obliviousness, as in the specialist's reaction to the unforeseen when it comes about. Instead of acknowledging the limitations of their proficiency levels, the types of academics whom Taleb criticizes will often attempt to make reality align with their calculations or theories when the reverse should be the case. By not making the necessary adjustments, potentially dangerous consequences can arise.    A very interesting read in the style of Malcolm Gladwell, whom Taleb briefly mentions, The Black Swan makes references to the ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as philosophers that include Aristotle, Plato, Hume, and Kant.  Present and former contemporaries include the aforementioned Niall Ferguson and,once again, famed mathematician, Benoit Mandelbrot, as well as ideological opponents that include the Nobel Prize winning economists, Robert C. Merton and  Myron Scholes. Using his ideas and amalgamating them with those whom he esteems, Taleb  sets a tone to encourage the reader or observer to appreciate a more empirical, bottom-up approach and to be skeptical of the rhetoric that is dogmatic or top-down, which, in this book, is labeled as Platonized.    All in all, Taleb mentions that mathematics and inductive reasoning can be used in the sciences but, again, cautions against applications in the social sciences. In the latter case, he is quick to point out that all the seemingly supportive pieces of data will never be enough to permanently affirm a hypothesis but on the other hand, the least counterexample can be potentially enough to invalidate. High marks for this well laid out lesson on how we should be humble and remain as such, especially when trying to see the future or understand human behavior.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|The Exorcism Of Emily Rose is, in my opinion, a very excellent film! The special FX are very convincing and the acting is superb. please take note: this is not your grandmothers movie!!! this movie is not the most happy movie of all time. there are lots of scary images and violence. the swearing is not too bad except for a few religious exclamations. they use the s-word and the b-word once. they also use the h-word three times. please take in mind when wanting to watch this film that it is not for the faint of heart. if you like movies such as [[ASIN:B001992NW4 The Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B00005LIRD The Legend of Hell House]] this is the perfect movie for you! :D  I hope this helps in your movie review hunting!

B0019OP0GU|5.0|First off, I'd like to say that I received this movie only 3 days after my purchase! Fantastic! It also came with a movie poster inside, which is now hanging beauifully on my wall! After receiving this movie, I literally watched it once everyday for a week. I myself, am a former ballerina of 12 years, and also an obsessed Harry Potter and Emma Watson fan, found this movie perfect. It is a british film, but it's in no way difficult to understand the accents, as they are all professional and speak very clearly.<br /><br />This is the story of three orphan girls who live with their guardian and nanny who are renting out rooms in their house in hopes of making some money. As the story progresses, the new housemates see different quirks and potentials in the girls, and suggest they take their hopes and dreams further.<br /><br />It's great for all ages because there isn't any bad language or scary parts in it, but I feel as though it would best hold the attention to children 10 and older.<br />I am most pleased with this purchase and if you love Emma Watson and/or ballet, heartwarming films, you'll love this one!

1594202842|5.0|This is an intriguing and thought provoking book. It is not a how to, but more of a self parody. My parents are Chinese immigrants and they raised me in a western way. Chua explains why the stereotyped immigrant parents would raise their children differently. Her parents raised her in the stereotyped Chinese way, and her Jewish husband and her tried to do the same but met with resistance. Some critics may say the strict parenting is considered mental abuse but we can all learn from her. We need to be honest with our children instead of only inflating their ego with compliments. Their hard work should be rewarded but they need to be informed when they are not living to their potential. They are going to be a part of the real world and praising parents cannot shelter them forever.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is by far the best childrens Christmas movie ever. Michael Caine is fantastic in this movie, and never knew he sung. We have been watching this movie ever year since discovering it when my daughter was 5 years old, she is now 20! It has become a tradition with us to get together and watch it again each year. I had to purchase new ones because the old one wore out. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone that would like a feel good movie for the Holidays.

B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer is an album that has thankfully gained notoriety some 3+ decades after it was released. This is one of progressive rock's finest moments, in that it features one of the most complex songs ever created (THE GATES OF DELIRIUM). This masterpiece of a song takes the listener across a spectrum of many different moods and sounds. It reminds me of a lot of the stuff from TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS. To some, that may not be a good thing to hear, but this song is stellar in arrangements, lyrics, vocals, keyboards, drums, bass, and guitar.....basically everything shines on this song. The band's energy and enthusiasm is clearly demonstrated in this project. The most refreshing thing about this album is its sense of experimentation. Many call this a transitional album; I somewhat disagree, because it still has the Yes signature progressive sound, with no excessive deviation from their previous stuff. Furthermore, it's refreshing to see them go from a psychedelic song (GATES) to a crazy-sounding high-energy funny and entertaining song (SOUND CHASER), then close with a soft, slow, anemic TO BE OVER. This song ends the album on a very high note, and it happens to be one of Steve Howe's all-time favorites. Oh, and the hiring of Patrick Moraz on keyboards was a pick for the ages. This guy really delivered big-time, and I really liked his influence and ideas. I think that many people will say that Rick Wakeman wasn't missed on this album. Moraz seamlessly filled a huge void. Finally, even though the album has picked up a lot of traction in recent years, I still think that it's underrated and underappreciated. Alan White says that Relayer is probably his favorite Yes album. That's not unusual to hear, in my opinion. This album is just plain awesome. 10/10

What I took away from the book is that Richard is a great listener and that might be one of the keys to great success. I also learned his rise to the top is - was full of tremendous challenges along the way he had to overcome. Many times even flirting with losing it all over the span of  his career. I am glad he has given up the record balloon trips for his wife,kids and the planets sake. It would be sad to loose such a forward thinker who looks beyond profits and tries to do whats right.

0307463745|2.0|Basically the Author has been successful and all his efforts have come through. And so these theories of do it small, do it first, think later etc..   The most important to any business is the Idea.. and the Author mentions it too. \\"An Idea that one believes in\\". My Opinion is, once you have such an Idea, which you believe in, all the thoughts and process the author has mentioned throughout the book will follow suit. If this was a book including failures and obstacles and how they overcame it, I would rate this as a practical \\"REWORK\\" book. This is just a success story of another Start up, who had their Ideas go through. Anyways there are some thoughts and reminders one can take from this book.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of zombies. There tends to be too much cliche and not enough interesting story. World War Z is entirely interesting. You learn about the zombies through the stories of the people. The zombies themselves are secondary.

B002ZG980U|5.0|I admire the level of detail by the several top reviews I read here, and enter this review primarily to draw those who follow my work on Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog, to the DVD and the other reviews.<br /><br />This was the last of five movies I watched over the course of sixteen hours in the air, and it comes very close to making the cut toward six stars.  This is--for the intelligence and information professionals--advanced Information Operations and Cyber-Psychological Operations on steroids.  I found the movie compelling.  It is not perfect, but Leonardo DeCaprio and the totality of the production easily earn a solid five.  This is much more serious than [[ASIN:B00009ZYC0 Minority Report (Widescreen Edition)]].  It is not as good as the [[ASIN:630438954X Seventh Veil [VHS]]], but for a modern movie exploring levels of consciousness and how to implant, steal, and manipulate ideas inside people over the course of ten years, it is quite worthwhile.  I recommend it be watched along with [[ASIN:B0006UEVQ8 What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]
1594202842|2.0|Much has been written here about the outrageous content of this book, but upon reading it, I would like to point out some things many people may be missing, or perhaps failing to consider.    Learning is not something that only happens when we are strapped to a desk and force-fed facts and figures. Learning is a bi-product of all human activity, and it happens in degrees. The easiest way to destroy the spirit of curiosity and creativity in a child is to turn learning into \\"work,\\" or something that one \\"as to do.\\" Now this is not to say we shouldn't introduce our children to academic subjects, teach and tutor them, and encourage them to learn new things. A child excels in areas she is interested in, and she MUST take eventual ownership over her education. People that have changed our world are those who have a legitimate interest in the areas in which they excel. I suspect Steve Wozniak would have written code and created new computer architectures despite the rich awards afforded him from Apple Computer. I am willing to bet his parents didn't strap him to a desk and force him to study computer science. Likewise, the novelist or artist does not create brilliant works of art because his mother demanded artistic perfection when he was ten years old.     For the Tiger Mother, education and learning are merely a means to an end, and that end is two-fold    a) Money  b) Prestige    One wonders how our Ivy League institutions churn out people this shallow and naive. The Tiger mother worries that her daughters will disgrace her by not graduating from an Ivy League school. Because the ends justify the means, he daughters are forced to follow in her footsteps under the threat of verbal and emotional violence.     When my boys grow up I want them to be happy and creative, and to love learning for its own sake. I don't want to turn them into robots who follow orders.    I don't need to point out the dangers of those who make it their guiding principle to    \\"just follow orders.\\"
0060765488|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) is a children's fantasy novel, the first and best-known in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.<br /><br />Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).<br /><br />Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.<br /><br />While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.<br /><br />The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions.

0385341008|5.0|In January of 1946, as war-torn Europe begins the rebuilding process after World War II, author Juliet Ashton is struggling to find a subject for her next book. She never expects that the subject will find her, literally showing up in her mailbox in the form of a letter from a stranger.<br /><br />Dawsey Adams, a resident of the Channel Island of Guernsey, finds Juliet's address inside a secondhand book by Charles Lamb. He writes to her to inquire if Lamb wrote any more books since there are no bookstores in Guernsey. In his letter, Dawsey mentions that he's a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, an organization which, thanks to one woman's quick thinking, saved several Guernsey residents from German arrest. Juliet writes back and wants to know more about this oddly named book club. Soon she is corresponding with several other Guernsey residents, all of whom are eager to share their experiences during the past five years of being cut off from the mainland by the Germans. Reading was an integral part of getting the small community through the years of German occupation. As Eben Ramsay writes, \\"We clung to books and to our friends; they reminded us that we had another part to us.\\"<br /><br />The story is told through a series of letters and the epistolary format works splendidly here. With each letter I read, I fell in love with Guernsey just as much as Juliet did. After reading two or three letters from a single character, I no longer needed to reference the italics above the letter that stated who was writing to whom. I could tell Dawsey's letters from Isola's and Isola's from Eben's just from their unique writing styles. I particularly enjoyed the banter between Juliet and her longtime friend and editor, Sidney.<br /><br />I picked up The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society while I was in the midst of moving, and this delightful book helped defuse a lot of moving-related stress. I had short, infrequent opportunities to read and the epistolary format was perfect for that situation. I could read several letters at a time, set the book down, and continue my reading later without missing a beat.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society has received a lot of praise, so much that I worried it might not be able to live up to my expectations. I'm pleased to report that it exceeded my (very high) expectations. Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows have created something truly special here, and the book deserves all the accolades it has been given. Smart, witty writing, a diverse cast of characters, and tales that range from heartwrenching to hilarious made this book into an instant favorite for me.

0316168815|2.0|Suzi, the narrator, of the THE LOVELY BONES tells her story from heaven. She tells us how she was lured into an underground cave where she was brutally raped and murdered. This is not a \\"who dun it\\" book. She shows us from the start. This book is a gripping piece about grief, love, and family with an odd coming-of-age angle. She has trouble letting go. She is in heaven (almost/sort of) but won't let go of the \\"why\\" to be able to go fully into heaven.<br /><br />I don't really appreciate when people make stuff up about heaven. Not that I have strong views about what it will be like, I just avoid filling my head with ideas, I don't think it will be anything like what anyone thinks. I was annoyed at everything that happened in the \\"heaven\\" scenes and noticed I breezed through those parts. Avoidance.<br /><br />My opinion about the storyline is that it is AWEFUL, only because it is so painful to hear about a child being raped and murdered. It was painful to read this book from beginning to end. Their family is of course torn apart because of the murder of Suzie. Of course her father went crazy looking for his baby, of course her mother avoided the pain and had an affair. It was hard to finish because of all the pain in this novel. But one can say that it did its job. It made an impression. It got to me. I wanted to cry. I wanted to kill the bad guy.<br /><br />With that in mind I am having a hard time determining the \\"time value\\" of this novel. I almost wished I hadn't read it because of all the pain in it. Yet, Alice did her job by getting to me through all that emotion. When I think about the latter, I say 3. But when I think about how much it hurt, I'm settling on a 2: Somewhat not worth the time invested.

B003L20ICE|5.0|While the film isn't necessarily easy to watch- it is rather uncomfortable at times- that equals the genius of it.  The characters are all TOO REAL.  It doesn't hesitate to show what some families are really like.<br />Are all same-sex families like this? NO.<br /><br />however, all families have unique dynamics and ALL FAMILIES come with their own set of unusual circumstances.<br /><br />This film is just once slice of post-modern family life... not every same-sex family life, but one story at least.<br /><br />What i really like is that it is normalizing to the relevant dynamic that affects thousands of persons in this world today whom have been born of an unknown sperm (or egg) donor.<br /><br />also, the performances are excellent.
B0001I55OC|3.0|If you have seen LOTR twenty times and want to take a break and watch something else. Timeline might do. It is science fiction, but not good science fiction. The \\"science\\" in it leaves a lot to be desired. How did they do those quick field C-14 readings? It is a love story, but not a great love story as there is virtually no character development. It is history as there was a 100 years war, but the facts in this story are manufactured. This was year 20 of the 100 Years War and even if the English did win this battle, it really would not have altered history as England simply didn't have a big enough army to hold and occupy France, even if no one lived there. They couldn't have won that war...even in a 100 years. Yes, it is also an action flick, but don't expect a lot of it.<br /><br />A corporation accidentally discovers a wormhole and time travel. The wormhole always leads to the same place in time, Castleguard in France, 1357. They transport back an archaeologist who gets stuck back there. They then send back a party to rescue him. Like most movie rescue parties, more people die trying to save one person than what it was worth. Oh yes, a woman is saved, who was supposed to die and this was supposed to have altered history, shades of Dr. McCoy!
B0044XV3R8|3.0|I like the movie, the extra scenes in the extended version and the format in which you can view them separately if you want.

B000CC4GEW|4.0|When Waterloo came out in 1971 it was a great overall movie that showed a view of Napoleon as everyone viewed him. Great costumes and sets with a cast of thousands. Rod Steiger was perfect for the part. The opening scene showing only the boots of his Generals ,echoing of the granite floors as they hurry to tell him he has been defeated for the first time, sticks out in my mind. They plead with him to surrender and he shouts no// so loud he echos off the walls. Camera work is great and the action is pure classic Hollywood even tho it was shot overseas by a foreign director. The movie was never released on video/DVD here . But copied overseas and put out . Quality is fine.Well worth seeing.

030746363X|5.0|I read a blurb on this book and went to the bookstore last night to pick it up.  Got home and read straight through, cover to cover until 3am.  It only took a few pages before I fell for the author, and my respect and admiration grew the deeper I delved.   I began the 30 day program today, and am excited to see my results.  But can I just say that any man who dedicates time, research and a full blown chapter to the 15 minute female orgasm could actually change the world.  People may find the subject merely titillating, but imagine a world full of happy men and women who are present in their body and dig their sexuality without shame.  This chapter alone is worth the price of the book, but you get so much more.  I texted, phoned and emailed all of my conscious friends and told them to buy this book straight away.  Buy ten or twenty copies and give them as gifts.  You'll be a hero.  Tim Ferriss, you rock.  Thank you.  Kathleen Beaton
030746363X|4.0|Unlike his last book 4 hour body is more of a reference guide for tips and tricks on how to get the most out of the biological tools at hand.  So far I found the slow carb diet to be really useful as well as the chapter on Injury Proofing the body.  I really like that it he backs up what he writes with an almost OCD level of testing.  I wouldn't take every item contained as gospel but i really like the direction that the book takes and would recommend it to anyone who takes more than a casual interest in maintaining their health.
B000TIO4Z0|5.0|The set comes with 69 CDs worth of aria collections and 22 complete operas, which are (in the order of recordings);<br />La Gioconda (2 versions)<br />Lucia di Lammermoor (2 versions)<br />I Puritani<br />Cavalleria Rusticana<br />Tosca (2 versions)<br />La Traviata<br />Norma (2 versions)<br />Pagliacci<br />La Forza del Destino<br />Il Turco in Italia<br />Madama Butterfly<br />Aida<br />Rigoletto<br />Il Trovatore<br />La Boheme<br />Un Ballo in Maschera<br />Il Barbiere di Siviglia<br />La Sonnambula<br />Turandot<br />Manon Lescaut<br />Medea<br />Carmen<br /><br />The EMI website says that these are \\"with brand new remasterings\\". The box specifically notes that Cetra recordings have been remastered for this set. I assume that the others are the most recent remasterings (the same ones used for Great Recordings of the Century?). The flimsy box and packaging require some care when handling. The 70th disk of the set is a Mac-compatible CD-ROM, from which librettos in the PDF format can be downloaded to your computer for all operas and arias (except, the libretto for Cavallera Rusticana seems missing for the Mac version). There is a photo gallery PDF, but I don't find any essay on the Mac CD-ROM.<br /><br />For newcomers to Italian operas, this is it. For the price of 3-4 complete opera recordings, you are getting nearly the entire repertoire of the standards. I should note that most recordings here are monaural and you will hear occasional hisses. But, the power, emotion, and subtlety projected by the most celebrated opera singer in the history will easily come through.<br /><br />For veteran collectors who know these recordings by heart, the only \\"negative\\" associated with this set is the feeling of dejection/envy that we once paid the full price for each disk. :)<br /><br />I may be cheating calling a 70-disk set as my desert island disks. Consider, though, I would be forgoing the rest of my collection of ~2000 CDs. Still, I will do okay on the island with this set alone. Indeed, listening through this set has given me a new perspective on Callas' legend. In this regard, as one reviewer noted above, a whole of this set is greater than its parts, which I always thought could not be surpassed to begin with.reviewer noted above, a whole of this set is greater than its parts, which I always thought could not be surpassed to begin with.

B003QCNFN8|2.0|I can understand that Ozzy's voice isn't what it was, but the one problem I've had with his work since he came out with No More Tears is the auto-tune like sound that negatively impacts the vocals.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|I give the film itself 4 stars because it is generally well made (except that too many close-ups of the actors' faces make it look like it was made with TV screens in mind -- perhaps with an eye to DVD sales) and the special effects are very good (the battle scene pitting the Cullen clan and the Quileute wolfpack against the army of newborn vampires, for instance), but I was put off by the alteration in the Edward/Bella storyline at the end which made it seem that Bella is more interested in becoming a vampire because she fits into that world, rather than her love for and desire to be with Edward. Although the purpose may have been to make Bella more of a \\"modern\\" and \\"liberated\\" woman, it changes the effect and leaves a slightly unpleasant aftertaste, since much of the charm and appeal of the story stems from the characters' devotion to each other. When Eclipse was first released to theaters, I stood in line with many other fans whose faces mirrored excitement and pleasure going in; however, those same faces were somewhat nonplussed going out. I'm sure my face had much the same expression. Hence, the opinion that the movie was \\"disappointing.\\" I have purchased the 3 films (Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse) that have been released to date, and although I plan to see Breaking Dawn (both parts) when it comes out, I'll be more wary going in. In a nutshell, the movies are okay; the books are better.

And there would be more entertainment value realized in that 15 seconds than in the whatever length this movie is. I don't know who in God's name is writing such favorable reviews on Amazon about this and all kinds of stuff, but for movies I am going to consult imdb.com to find out the gross from now on. Only after wasting 2 hours on this thing did I find out it grossed like $50,000. Should have been an indicator.

B001VNB54A|5.0|No, it's not Band of Brothers.  I've read several reviews comparing and contrasting The Pacific with BOB.  Some critics/reviews say it's more reflective of the personal battles and issues with 3 primary characters and there's a lot of truth to that.  Does it deal more with the personal struggles than BOB did?  I don't think so.    I think The Pacific, as did Band of Brothers, serves to document the extraordinary actions and the harsh reality of WWII.  This series really brings home the stark differences of the war in the Pacific theater as opposed to Europe.  The combat scenes can sometimes seem unrealistically overwhelming and a few caused me to read up on some history.  At first I felt the series \\"over did it\\" in a few battle scenes but then I put myself in the place of those fighting in the battles and realized it HAD to have seemed even WORSE than depicted on the screen.    For someone who is anti-military I can see where they could pick out issue after issue in this series to support their views.  For someone who is looking for an all out war/action series I can see where they would be disappointed with the time spent depicting the atrocities and the emotional struggles.  But if you want to see a straight forward accounting of what these people were subjected to, struggled with and came away with, this series will make an impression on you.    I must stress to potential buyers/viewers of this series, like Band of Brothers and Generation Kill, this is intended to be more of an historical accounting of what happened rather than a story to entertain you.  BOB and the Pacific have episodes that are well crafted to allow the flow of actual events to work well together, and help you follow what is happening to and with the characters.  GK is more of a \\"start to finish\\" accounting that doesn't attempt to tie things together for the viewer - you figure it out as you go.    For those who are into history and the military, a \\"must see\\".  If you're not into the brutalityand gore of war, don't bother.

B003ES5ZPK|5.0|This HDMI Swivel adapter does exactly what you need it to do, making it easy to route around corners and place the TV closer to the wall or angle the cable in a direction that is not perpendicular to the back of the television or other device.

To me, this device makes my media set-ups much easier, which exactly what I wanted from it.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I'll admit that the first time I watched Scott Pilgrim I didn't entirely buy into the hype. I liked the film, but a lot of people have had such great affection for this movie I didn't really see what the big deal was. Watching the film a second time, I was astounded by how much I liked it. If another more inventive film was released in 2010, I didn't see it.    The story is based on a graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, but I've never read or even seen a physical copy of this series so my review for the film is based on the film's own merit.     The film takes place in Toronto, Canada where Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a 22-year-old, plays bass in a band called Sex-Bob-omb, lives with a gay roommate (Kieran Culkin), and is dating a 17-year-old high school girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). After Scott meets the girl of his dreams (literally), American Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom I found incredibly attractive in this film), everything seems to fall into place. The only problem is, if he wants to date Ramona he must battle and defeat her seven evil exes.     Much of the cast is filled with familiar faces including Brandon Routh, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick, and the terrific Jason Schwartzman and all the actors within seem to be having a lot of fun. It's true that Michael Cera is basically playing the character we are accustomed to seeing him play, yet he fits this role perfectly. I can't imagine an actor more perfect to portray Scott Pilgrim.    Now, a lot of people take certain movies too seriously. They can suspend their disbelief for a movie like Transformers, but when they're watching a film that begins as a highly-stylized romance and suddenly turns into a cinematic video-game, they have issues accepting it. I admit that this is not a movie for everyone, but those who call it \\"stupid\\" simply don't \\"get it.\\" That's not to say you don't \\"get it\\" if you just don't like the film, but no one can dispute that this is an intelligent, well-rendered film. With that said, I am 18-years-old and while watching the film I wondered if it would or could be enjoyed and appreciated by someone much older than myself. The creative elements throughout the film (even much of the dialogue) are representative of the years I grew up in and on many people of my generation. While no one can really say until years from now, I think that, in a way, Scott Pilgrim may be more of a \\"generation-defining\\" film than The Social Network.     Edgar Wright co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Bacall and I was surprised by how well-written the film is. To a lot of people, Scott Pilgrim functions most noticeably on a visual level but the writing is both fun and energetic. The humor will definitely only appeal to certain tastes, but I found it quite witty. The dialogue is written in a quirky, witty highly-stylized (a description that can be used to describe most everything about this film) lingo that, while memorable, doesn't become an annoyance as it did in Juno. The writing is really the heart of the story for in-between the extravagant action sequences, there's a nice love story with likable characters.     What elevates this material significantly is the creative vision of director Edgar Wright. Not being a reader of comics or a player of video games, I may be a little out of my element here but, I don't believe another director has come closer to bringing both a comic book and a video game to the screen than Wright has with this film. The battle scenes are literally a video game put to film, with Scott even picking up tokens after defeating Ramona's exes. While I'm not a gamer, I recognized many of the video game references and there are many of them, with even the Universal logo being one. The way Wright chooses to film the smallest things, like the unique look of Sex-Bob-omb playing, is delightfully clever. It's clear that Wright put every ounce of creative energy he had into creating this world and I can't imagine another director pulling it off as flawlessly as he does. It's too early to call the film innovative, but I've never seen anything like it. While marketing has made it look like a teen action-comedy, Scott Pilgrim is a highly artistic film with vibrant imagery and boundless energy. Even the soundtrack, fashioned by Nigel Goodrich, is energetic (there's that word again) and atmospheric while not being something I generally listen to.    Scott Pilgrim is not an intellectual film, but it is a high-minded one. While I don't know if it's a comment on the videogame/hipster subculture, a satire of various trends, a homage to those trends, or a combination of everything I do recognize it as a terrific skewering of pop culture. Whatever the case, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the most inventive, original film of 2010 that I enjoyed and appreciated even more the second time around. While it was not a box office success, it's already gathered a substantial fanbase and I predict this film will become a certifiable cult classic with the appreciation, love, and respect for it only growing as the years pass by.    GRADE: A-
B00447G2T8|5.0|From the opening tribal drums, which lead to the subtle, intelligent riffing on \\"Where the Sinners Go\\", you already sense this release from Helloween has got something special to it.    Then, \\"Are You Metal?\\" follows, featuring modern-flavored rhythm guitars and a high dose of aggression. By then, you start wondering where those boys from the \\"happy metal\\" years are... Well, they're probably still there; but this time they balance perfectly all the ingredients of modern power metal with their own style: syncopated riffs, high-pitched-but-not-cheesy melodic vocals, some thick-sounding choirs, thunderous double-kicking drums and a few nods to progressive metal.    Luckily, they never surrender this time to snobbish technicalities, as to me that was the main defect their preceding effort (\\"The Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy\\") had. Thanks to this, the obtained result remains absolutely fresh to my ears, in spite of its maturity... and in spite of the generic nature of a couple of guitar solos.     My personal standouts are thus the aforementioned \\"Are You Metal?\\", plus \\"Who Is Mr. Madman?\\", \\"You Stupid Mankind\\" and \\"My Sacrifice\\". However, every single song here has something interesting to offer, from \\"Raise the Noise\\" (Ah, that flute solo!), to the moody \\"The Smile of the Sun\\"... and even to the unnecessarily long (IMHO) \\"Far In The Future\\".    In few words, Helloween might have released with this album the comeback of the year, and without any doubt one of the best albums of their entire career. In short, this deserves 4.5 sounding, perfectly-produced stars... which I'll round to 5, 'cause this is a really rocking album. BUY IT NOW!

B00428ZRFE|4.0|So, iam on my way to get into the album more and more. Thats my point of view, some songs have to be listened more  often. Ok, three of them are hits here in Germany, that is 'Only Girl', the song performed with Eminem 'Love You...' and 'What's my Name? feat. Drake', they didnt need a support, cuz they are really Top Songs.  My next favorite would be 'Cheers (Drink to that)'. So what do you think ?
B003EY7IRC|5.0|It was a good read, I literally read it in one day,now I'm waiting in line again to read it again.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|The Blade Itself is a good start, but not really great.  I would give this book 3.5 stars.  Where this book suffers is in direction.  The book follows a handful of characters, each with their own plot line that intertwine with each other at various times.  The majority of the book feels like a variety of subplots with little focus on the main conflict.  I realize that it is the first book in a series, but usually you finish the first book with a good idea of what the main conflict is and what the ultimate goal is.  By the end of this book you know that some of the characters are going to someplace, but you don't really know why.  You really only know the name of the ultimate bad guy, and not much else.  All of this left me somewhat dissatisfied.    However the characters made this book worth the read.  The battle weary barbarian, and the crippled torturer are my two favorite characters.  Their stories alone made the book worth reading though.    Despite the lake of central focus in this book, there was a lot going on.  There were many fights, and a great deal of politics and intrigue.  The book was a good set up for a series, I just wish it had a little more on the main conflict.
0307272702|1.0|Quick, someone run out and tell all those slender, healthy Asians, especially the world's longest living Okinawans and heart disease free rural Chinese who have thrived on diets of 90% carbohydrates, that they have it all wrong.   Oh yeah, the US dairy meat and dairy industry is doing a pretty good job of changing things over there, and lo and behold, obesity and heart disease is now rising!  Quite dramatically in fact, especially in Japan where meat and fat consumption is rising as well.  Hmm, confuses Dr., er I mean, Mr. Taubes' thesis doesn't it?    Really, has Mr. Taubes even traveled anywhere else in the world?  Is it really possible that carbs are the main problem when so many of the worlds slimmest, most heart disease free people's follow diets based on starches and carbs.  Go to rural China, Japan, Mexico.  Do you see any fat people?  These people have traditionally lived on starch based diets composed of mostly unrefined carbs.  90% carbs in most cases.  Of course most of them eat unrefined starches, and everyone agrees that refined carbs are bad, but really, to jump to the conclusion that a meat and fat based diet is healthy is just not supported by any long term evidence in the real world.   Sorry, but there are just too many societies in this world that have thrived on starch based diets to believe anything in this book.
B003UESJH4|4.0|I did not hate this movie at all.  It had no real weak spots save for one, which contributes to my claiming of the term \\"average\\".<br /><br />The story largely deals with, obviously, the Duke of York and eventual King bunch of names, called \\"Bertie\\" for short, George VI and his stammer.  Everyone's acting is top notch, particularly Colin Firth, putting on a voice that sounds natural from him, yet compared to his work in other movies, is clearly too high and sharp to be his natural voice.<br /><br />The relationship between Lionel and Bertie is the core of this movie, and the best parts of it.  And yet, due to narrative necessity, we also get insights into the personal lives of both men, with quick scenes of Lionel Logue and his family, and Bertie dealing with the awkwardness involved in being son of George V, with his voluptuous, luxurious voice, and the heir to the throne soon to be King Edward the VIII.  Unless you know the history of the period and recognize these figures (which as an American, I don't), these scenes are largely unremarkable, and not very endearing to help you feel Edward's dilemma, or George V's.  As well, historical figures like Winston Churchill and Neville Chamberlain have very small appearances, barely qualifying as cameos.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth is functional.  She acts, she portrays the character, but she could easily be replaced by any other capable actor and nothing would be lost in the performance or the aura.<br /><br />The best moments of the movie involve Bertie and Lionel, culminating in the King's war-time speech, with Lionel in the booth with him, \\"orchestrating\\" him, which comes across brilliantly dramatic and climactic.<br /><br />However, the story and its direction comes across as average.  Painfully average.  Everything is so very predictable in how it unfolds, with Lionel Logue being the \\"unorthodox\\" kook who asks questions more suitable for a therapist than a speech instructor, demands to be called \\"Lionel\\" and not \\"Doctor\\" or \\"Mister Logue\\" as well as to call him \\"Bertie\\" instead of \\"Your Royal Highness\\", to doing \\"nutty\\" things like making a deal with Bertie that if he can recite a monologue from Hamlet without stammering, he won't need to see Lionel ever, to Bertie failing that bet, and Lionel trying the \\"crazy\\" idea of having him record his voice reciting the monologue, while he has headphones on playing music loud enough to not hear his own voice.<br /><br />And surprise!  He doesn't stammer!  With this obvious clich&eacute;, he goes about under Lionel's tutelage to help with his stammer.<br /><br />Then comes the obvious dramatic conflict in the middle where Bertie stops seeing Lionel because Lionel claims that Bertie will likely be king, despite Edward still being King, which Bertie claims to be treason as a masque for his own fears of becoming King.  Then he does become King, and goes back to seeing Lionel.  This sequence is what I refer to at the start of my review.<br /><br />Then comes the obvious REVELATION as it's discovered Lionel Logue ISN'T a doctor, or a professional of any kind, with Lionel then giving his backstory of how he helped Australian ANZAC veterans from the Gallipoli campaign to speak again after being shell shocked and unable to speak or speak clearly, and defending himself by claiming he never said he was a doctor, kept insisting not to be called doctor, and his office has him listed solely as \\"Lionel Logue\\" and not doctor.<br /><br />Then the obvious reconciliation and forgiveness and friendship between the two.<br /><br />This movie is not bad, but its only strengths are in its actors and chemistry which only occurs in about half the movie.  Story-wise, it's average and clich&eacute;.  Definitely a worthy Oscar nominee for best actor, supporting actor, etcetera.  Best picture is a far stretch, in my opinion.ister Logue\\" as well as to call him \\"Bertie\\" instead of \\"Your Royal Highness\\", to doing \\"nutty\\" things like making a deal with Bertie that if he can recite a monologue from Hamlet without stammering, he won't need to see Lionel ever, to Bertie failing that bet, and Lionel trying the \\"crazy\\" idea of having him record his voice reciting the monologue, while he has headphones on playing music loud enough to not hear his own voice.

0152023984|1.0|I ordered 2 different versions of this hardback book. This newer translation by Richard Howard arrived before the second version that was translated by Katherine Woods. I compared the two books when I had them together. The newer version (Howard) was manufactured in China by Harcourt, Brace and Co. and the paper is thinner and the illustrations are dead and not very colorful other than the bright blue cover.The newer translation cuts the book to 83 pages from the 91 in the older edition. The older, Katherine Woods' translation is far more poetic to read and the brightly watercolored illustrations are on thicker paper, and seem vibrant in comparison.  The older edition was made by Harcourt, Brace and Company in New York and manufactured in the United States with an ivory cover. I am just guessing, but they were probably trying to save money on the newer edition, thus cutting it down and having it made in China on thinner paper with a cheaper printing process! I would never buy this new version as a gift for anyone. I would look for an older edition translated by Katherine Woods.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The Best book by Rick Riordan yet! I think its better than Percy Jackson. It is a little dull at some times like all books are, but it is a great read for any interested in Greek Gods,Action,and Adventure.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|This miniseries was just so-so. It took until the third and fourth disk to even start learning character names. We asked \\"who is that?\\" so many times up until then. There wasn't good character development from the start.<br />There was way too much nudity, it was completely out of place for the movie and didn't add to the storyline it distracted from it and cheapened it. It's like they went into this one saying okay we are going to make the guys grittier and show the darker side.  That could have been achieved without the nudity and kept it classy and we would have enjoyed the love interest story lines more.<br />Even by the end there were less than 5 characters that either of us knew the name of. This is coming from die hard Band of Brothers fans. We bought that set and have watched it at least 4 times. We've lended it out to people saying you have to watch this. When you watch Band of Brothers, you feel the characters and you grow attached.  By the end of that one we were crying when it went through who the real people were. We never formed an emotional attachment to any of the characters of The Pacific except knowing there were real people who went through that. Leckie was the closest exception and the actor who played him was outstanding in the role.<br />There was some well-done action scenes, but they were very scattered between the heavy focus on the love interests in the movie.<br />So it was a mixed bag with this one.  I appreciate they made it and the effort that went into it, but I think it could have been a lot better.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story 3 was a great family movie for any age. It consists of many different levels of fun. The words are not too difficult for a small child to understand, but not too low for an older child. It may not be an educational movie, but it's definitely worth sitting down for a family night after dinner, enjoying time together and laughing about everything those toys get into. My son is only 2 and actually sits still for almost the entire movie (we split it into 2 sittings because he's a very active child.)
0143105426|3.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin, who was born on December 16, 1775, is a classic novel that is loved by many because of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet.  The book was published in 1813, but Miss Austin actually intended it to be published in 1797, but sadly, it was rejected. Jane Austin has also published Sense and Sensibility, a story about two sisters with a meager amount of money, Mansfield Park, and many others. Although Miss Austin produced many great works, she had to leave the world sometime. She died in 1817 by a sudden illness. Even though Jane Austin died many years ago, her books are regarded as some of the best books ever written.<br /><br /> In a town called Longbourn, sometime in the 19th century, Miss Elizabeth Bennet lives with her family, Mrs. Bennet, a foolish woman who only cares if her daughters marry, Mr. Bennet, a sensible man who runs the house, but is in an unhappy marriage, Mary, Caroline, Lydia, a snooty girl who only cares about herself, and her favorite sister, Jane, who is madly in love with Mr. Charles Bingley, a wealthy man who purchases Netherfield, his estate that is close to the Bennet's house. Elizabeth is a sensible young lady in her mid-twenties, but sometimes let her pride makes her think in prejudice ways because she likes to ponder on the character of others. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is one such person that Elizabeth believes has a bad character, although she doesn't know him very well. With so many characters about, sometimes it's hard to remember who is who, but after a while you get quite used to it.<br /><br /> The main conflict in Pride and Prejudice is the feelings that Elizabeth has for Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story, she utterly hates him, but near the middle, she starts doubting her way she views character.  Because of the interchanging turmoil in Elizabeth's heart, she isn't sure what to feel about Mr. Darcy. Another conflict is Mr. Bingley's feelings for Jane, who isn't even sure of his feelings for her. Theplot pretty much centers around those two main conflicts. Although, there are many other mini conflicts that the plot focuses on also. One example would be Mr. Collin's conflict with Elizabeth. He wishes her to marry him, because he is supposed to take over the estate when Mr. Bennet dies. Mr. Bennet, a cautious and humorous man, is not so happy that his cousin is going to take over the estate. Even though this is how I perceived the book, I'm sure it's very close to what the critics say.<br /><br /> When Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, the whole book starts getting more thought provoking. Will Elizabeth say yes? Or will she say no? Either way, there is more than just her answer. Why did she say what she said? Well, I guess you'll have to read to find out. While you are wrapping that around your head, let me tell you about the theme of the story. There are several themes in Pride and Prejudice but a main one is reputation. Reputation really matters in this book. Mrs. Bennet, with her obnoxious manners and comments, disgraced the family several times throughout the story. And when a certain someone runs away, the family is in danger of being condemned forever in disgrace. And while the Elizabeth endured all of this, the family hardly noted that any of this was occurring, maybe because they only care about getting their daughters married, since that would bring them money.  Either way, reputation really matters in this book.<br /><br /> All in all, I really didn't like this book because it was really boring. I know the book is a classic, but it made me go to sleep. The book is written beautifully, don't get me wrong. But it didn't keep my attention very well. Yes, I did finish it, and let's just say I could see the finish a mile away.  While the beginning was slightly compelling, it just wasn't something I was willing to read. I had to forcefully work my way through this book. Elizabeth, who was an interesting person, made too many prejudices that it got on my nerveafter a while. I will say though, that maybe if I tried harder, I could've eased into this book much better if I wasn't rushing to read it. On my scale of buy, borrow, or skip, I would say borrow, but only if you are really into classics.

B003YUC2FE|2.0|I give all 3 movies 5 stars, and want to upgrade my collection to bluray.  I rented these and the picture and sound on all 3 are among the best blurays I've ever seen.  However all they make are these multi-disc sets (even individually) forcing me to pay for extra stuff just to get the blurays.  Some people might want to pay twice as much to include the DVD or Digital discs, but I'm sure many don't.  Please just release the blurays only.  Disney you'll still make a profit.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|I'm not going to rate the film itself, as most people that would look at these reviews will probably be more concerned with the Blu-Ray picture quality, and are already familiar with this amazing film.  I must admit that in most cases, Blu-Ray picture quality doesn't look all that different from the DVD versions of the same film; however, Se7en is an exception to that rule, as this is the best looking Blu-Ray I've seen thus far!  I already owned this film on DVD, and although there are not any additional special features on this Blu-Ray disk when compared to the DVD edition, the improved picture quality completely justifies the cost of upgrading to the Blu-Ray, especially if you're like me and already own the DVD version.  You can tell that they truly remastered the picture and sound when creating this Blu-Ray, because it looked and sounded astounding on my 1080i HD TV.  I recommend this Blu-Ray to anyone that loves this film!
0547258305|5.0|This book was not what I expected. I expected something light, fast-reading, entertaining, but altogether forgettable. What I actually got was not a whirlwind YA Fantasy, but a rollicking earth quake of a novel with real characters, a fantastic new world and a heroine that thinks and feels and kicks some major butt.<br />Graceling is definitely a book you can get lost in, again and again. I loved it!
0316010669|2.0|This book does nothing more than skims the surface on the subject of snap judgments and general psychology. Gladwell does nothing more than report on the subject matter, offering no depth, no analysis, no digging deeper into associated concepts to help the reader better understand the context and material in the book; not to mention that the more cognitive types will find it - quite literally - an empty read.<br /><br />Read it like a news story if you must, because in my opinion it's just one long-winded, repetitive news article.<br /><br />Cheers.
030746363X|5.0|An outstanding guide for nutrition and fitness. I am a 20 year old college student who was already fit when the book came out. I was looking for some unconventional ideas to propel my fitness level and this definitely had them! The book is meant for you to take in pieces like losing fat, gaining muscle, getting stronger, running faster, etc. If you take it in pieces it is very easy to get results. Also, like he says in the beginning DO NOT take the book word for word. You use his ideas and his data to better yourself. What works best for him might not for you. If you eat his diet and follow the workouts you'll look and perform way better than your peers.
B003UESJHE|4.0|Let me start by saying that The King's Speech (2010) is fun to watch. I really enjoyed going to the theater and sitting with a large crowd to see this film. It's not quite as fresh and funny as The Kids Are All Right (2010), but it's well written, well acted, and nicely crafted. The movie's pacing is a bit slow at times, but with so many great scenes throughout the film, I was able to get through the boring bits. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5, and it's definitely one of my Top 10 movies of 2010. Actor Colin Firth is the star of this historic biopic about King George VI of Britain, and it's another incredible performance by him in a role that will probably get him the Best Actor Oscar next month. Firth was nominated in 2009 for Best Actor in A Single Man (2009), director Tom Ford's absolutely brilliant feature film debut. With these two excellent acting performances back to back, Firth has positioned himself as a real dramatic leading man, of which we seemingly have so few today.<br /><br />King George VI was a stutterer, suffering with an inability to speak clearly at a time when radio was coming into its golden age as the primary means of mass communication. Set primarily in the 1930s, and leading up to World War II, The King's Speech is a fascinating and enjoyable look into the 20th century British Monarchy from behind-the-scenes. King George VI suffered from a severe speech impediment that initially kept him from ascending to the throne over his brother. But as his brother King Edward VIII, played by Guy Pearce, pursued a \\"scandalous\\" relationship with an American woman, George was forced to take over for his brother as King when Edward abdicated the throne. As King, especially during the impending World War II crisis, George was forced to give speeches both in person and over the radio in order to keep his country's citizens united and strengthened. These radio speeches are now historically famous and well documented as crucial in Britain's build-up to fighting Hitler and Germany.<br /><br />Apparently King George VI struggled to find a speech therapist who could get to the core of his problem: emotional confidence. But George ultimately found the right guy to help him and trust with his wife the Queen's assistance, in the unorthodox and \\"illegitimate\\" workings of Lionel Logue, played perfectly by Geoffrey Rush. Rush brings a wacky, intelligent, and heart-warming performance to the screen as Logue, which he's been nominated for as Best Supporting Actor in this year's Oscars. It's right up there with his best work in Shine (1996), Shakespeare In Love (1998), Elizabeth (1998), and the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The best scenes in the film are always between Rush and Firth, their onscreen chemistry is just pitch perfect in The King's Speech. I'm not sure that one could have done it without the other. Helena Bonham Carter is hilarious and wonderful in her role as Queen Elizabeth, wife to Colin Firth's King George. It's her most \\"restrained\\" work I've ever seen. Carter usually plays extremely over-the-top characters that you love for their incredible weirdness. But as the Queen, she shows another side of her comedic and dramatic acting talents. It's a brilliant performance that she's been nominated for it in this year's Oscars as Best Supporting Actress.<br /><br />With an incredible script and cast, British director Tom Hooper has brought his A-game to The King's Speech. After seeing his work on HBO's stunning historical miniseries John Adams (2008), I knew this movie would have a unique look and feel. Hooper is clearly a director who focuses on the details. Every set, every location, every shot has a fascinating detailed look about it. Hooper is a visual storyteller that brings his unique style and point of view to his work and it clearly shines in collaboration with his cast and crew. I also recently watched Hooper's film The Damned United (2009), after seeing The King's Speech, and it's another good film showing Hooper's talent as a filmmaker. I definitely want to catch up with Hooper's work and see HBO's highly regarded short miniseries Elizabeth I (2005).<br /><br />The production design on The King's Speech by Eve Stewart is spot-on, giving the movie a genuine historic look and feel for every set, location, costume, and prop. Part of what I really love about historical movies is always the incredible attention to detail in the production design. It almost always gives those films something that makes them stand out from the pack. The old radio microphones and technology, combined with Colin Firth's emotional body language, make you feel right in your bones that you are there in the 1930s. That's not an easy feat in today's modern world, but Stewart and her art department team did a top notch job doing it.<br /><br />Like any great movie, the cinematography either makes the story more engaging for the viewer, or it takes away and distracts the viewer from the story. Director of Photography Danny Cohen brings a great visual look to The King's Speech through his lighting and camera shot choices. There are visuals from this film that still wander around my mind on a daily basis weeks after I've seen the film. And whenever I hear the name \\"The King's Speech\\", I immediately remember some of the incredible photographic images from the movie. Cohen definitely deserved his recent Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography for The King's Speech. It's one of the best looking films from 2010.<br /><br />While music composer Alexandre Desplat's original score for The King's Speech is good solid work that fits the film very nicely, I'm not quite as enamored by it as some critics and music aficionados. I do want to listen to it a few more times on its own, separate from the film, to garner a more full opinion on it. But I Desplat did a great job bringing his musical talents to The King's Speech for what it needed.<br /><br />Finally, I can't say enough about screenwriter David Seidler's script for The King's Speech. I listened to a great iTunes podcast interview with Seidler by Jeff Goldsmith of Creative Screenwriting Magazine, where they discussed this screenplay and it's own interesting backstory. This movie was decades in the making, since Seidler had to agree to not write the script or make the movie until Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI, had passed away. And of course this kind of material and subject matter was not popular in Hollywood regardless, so getting financing for the film was its own struggle. But Seidler's passionate commitment to this story, his writing, and this film really came through. If it weren't for a very competitive original film script field in this year's Oscar nominations, I would probably choose Seidler's script as the best of 2010. But it wouldn't surprise me if Seidler wins the Oscar over my choice of Christopher Nolan for Inception.<br /><br />The King's Speech is a real treat of a movie, one you can take the whole family to in my opinion. I'm flabbergasted that our MPAA Ratings Board is so archaic in their thinking that just because the F-word is used more than once in this movie that it deserves an 'R' rating. There's no nudity or violence, just a few expletive words in a hilarious speech therapy scene. This is really just a PG-13 film and I'm glad to see that the film's 'R' rating has not made much of a difference at the box office. Go see this film while you still can at the theater...it's worth every dollar you spend on your ticket.I definitely want to catch up with Hooper's work and see HBO's highly regarded short miniseries Elizabeth I (2005).    The production design on The King's Speech by Eve Stewart is spot-on, giving the movie a genuine historic look and feel for every set, location, costume, and prop. Part of what I really love about historical movies is always the incredible attention to detail in the production design. It almost always gives those films something that makes them stand out from the pack. The old radio microphones and technology, combined with Colin Firth's emotional body language, make you feel right in your bones that you are there in the 1930s. That's not an easy feat in today's modern world, but Stewart and her art department team did a top notch job doing it.    Like any great movie, the cinematography either makes the story more engaging for the viewer, or it takes away and distracts the viewer from the story. Director of Photography Danny Cohen brings a great visual look to The King's Speech through his lighting and camera shot choices. There are visuals from this film that still wander around my mind on a daily basis weeks after I've seen the film. And whenever I hear the name \\"The King's Speech\\", I immediately remember some of the incredible photographic images from the movie. Cohen definitely deserved his recent Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography for The King's Speech. It's one of the best looking films from 2010.     While music composer Alexandre Desplat's original score for The King's Speech is good solid work that fits the film very nicely, I'm not quite as enamored by it as some critics and music aficionados. I do want to listen to it a few more times on its own, separate from the film, to garner a more full opinion on it. But I Desplat did a great job bringing his musical talents to The King's Speech for what it needed.    Finally, I can't say enough about screenwriter David Seidler's script for The King's Speech.

1416550550|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. When i started reading it i couldn't put it down, and when i finally had to all i wanted to do was to start reading it again. It is definetly one of those books that you must read more than once. It is a long twisting journey of a book, with loads of emotion and it keeps you interested til the very end. I felt like i knew the characters so personally after finishing this book. It has really exciting twists and turns and will definetly keep you in suspence. Great detail, captivating, and gothic romantic read. my favorite book so far. Read it! :)
B003ZSJ212|5.0|George Lucas is one of those people in the movie business that takes awhile to try new technology. He is extremely \\"old school\\" when it comes to film making. All three of the orignial star wars movies were shot on 35mm film in 2.35:1 Cinemascope. And that was the best at that time aka long before digital, but also in use for over two decades even in 1977. The first was a well know Disney film, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. And out of what i call the new star wars movies. In May 2002 Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones became the first high-profile, high-budget movie released that was shot on 24 frame-per-second high-definition digital video, using a Sony HDW-F900 camera. And every big budget movie since, Lord of the Rings, Transformers, Avatar, etc has used this format still at a 2.35:1 ratio. And of course star wars 3(or 6, depends on how old you are..lol) was shot in 100% Digital. So the point? Star Wars Attack of the clones, and Revenge of the Sith are the two out of the six that will benefit the most from bly ray. All the older movies, i guess, are being coverted to digital from the original negatives, that by the way George keeps under lock and key in a climate controlled safe. If it is done right, and i am sure it will be. They will look awesome as well. However Attack of the clones and Revenge of the Sith will have the advantage of being 100% Digital from the moment action was yelled. As for me i am still waiting on the 3D version of the films, that the rumor mill has coming out in the not to distant future.
0981951244|5.0|I am a physician that leads a large organization of more than 500 people and I absolutely love this book.  It was simple to read and understand and has applicable content that can be used immediately.  As I applied the specific principles and routines in this book, my effectiveness and productivity improved drastically.  I am more focused and balanced than I have ever been and I am moving closer to all my goals with absolute clarity and certainty.  My new morning and evening routines have removed most of the stress and anxiety that I felt from being pulled in so many different directions throughout the day.  I am happier and my wife if too.  My life is in sync and it feels great.  Thank you Darren for this amazing book.
0545123275|4.0|When I started reading this book, I wasn't expecting much after reading some reviews. (turned because of A/C? WTF?)    Going in like that, I wasp pleasantly surprised. The characters seemed pretty real to me. The romance was really cute. You could definitely tell how much they truly adored each other.    I liked how Sam was a normal boy with *gasp* TESTOSTERONE, unlike other male leads in other books who wouldn't touch the female lead 'until marriage.' I always looked froward to the chapters that were from his perspective the most.    Of course the parental units were always conveniently away and busy with their own lives.    This is NOT a book full of action, suspense and crazy vampire VS wolves VS the world type of thing at all. It's a romance that gets more intriguing and exciting towards the end when  certain things happen and are revealed.     All in all. I think this book is really sweet and charming. I BELIEVED in their obsessed love.
0439023521|5.0|I like to call myself a \\"sensitive viewer\\".  I literally will have physical reactions to heavy violence, torture, etc.  For instance I almost lost my lunch a few times while watching Black Swan recently (and people are calling it a dark comedy!!).  So after reading the synopsis I was shocked that this is YA and EW is calling it the next \\"Twilight\\".  But specifically due to the fact that it is YA is the reason I thought, \\"Well it can't be THAT violent.\\"  And it's not too bad.  In fact, it's really good.  There are some parts that are brutal and it's not a perfect book i.e. the author shows a bit of laziness with gifts magically parachuting out of the sky at dire moments and Katniss constantly aware of the cameras and the audience but she never once sees a camera?  That bothered me.  It also raised some questions which may be answered in the next books, e.g. Why do the Districts continue having children at all and how could a parent ever let his/her child be dragged away like that?  However I can't NOT give 5 stars to a book I bought on Monday and was late for work on Thursday morning because I HAD to finish it.  I will be reading the next two very soon.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|GREAT stuff!  Oredered two sets...one for my son too.  The videos are cool!  We saw them live at Lollapalooza and would love to see that come out on BLU RAY!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The product itself was perfect and was recieved in a great amount of time! The content is just incredible. I fell in love with the series from the first minute of episode one. So glad i chose to buy this!
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|It is easy to get used to the vibrant colors of BD, but I didn't think they would be able to make such an old movie look so good.  We had been watching this movie on an old VHS, and then I decided to purchase the blu-ray edition.  I was shocked at how washed out and old the colors really were on the VHS we had been watching.  It was like watching a whole new movie.  The detail and eye catching colors were wonderful. It just reinforced that Walt Disney was a genius. There is even an option to watch it with curtains to each side of the screen.  That's kind of gimmicky, but is kinda cool (I can appreciate good gimmick sometimes). I do want to mention that for those of you who haven't watched this movie in a long time.....beware the scary scenes when the hunter and Snow White are in the woods.  Snow Whites run through the woods is really quite scary.  If your child is very little or scares easily you might want to skip this part of the movie (just watch it yourself first to decide).  My 2 1/2 year old little girl got a scared by it the first time we watched it on VHS and it's even more vivid on the BD edition (it had been years since I had seen it and I didn't think about it scaring her).  I felt so guilty!
1400052173|5.0|Wow. I read some glowing reviews before I bought this book, and I really doubted that it would be as riveting as many claimed, but I was proven wrong! This an interesting story on so many levels, very well told, and was hard to put down. I am lending it out to friends now. At the heart of the story is Henrietta, who had such an abbreviated and difficult life, but by the end of the book my tears were falling for other reasons. If Rebecca Skloot takes another ten years to write her next book (I hope there is one), it will be worth the wait! Another great read involving medicine, history and mystery, is \\"Deaths on Pleasant Street\\" by Giles Fowler. I highly recommend it!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|These cables are super inexpensive and have great quality and work perfect.  How can you say no?  Cables at stores are in the $30-$60 range.<br /><br />I found myself bragging about these cables cuz of how freakin' cheap they are.
B001G2B15Y|4.0|I have not read the whole book, but the biographies that I have read have very meaningful lessons for the stock trader
B003ITZBVS|5.0|I'll keep this very short & sweet as I'm not getting into full structure of the film as you can see that in some of the other detailed reviews which are great.     My advice is if you are a superhero fan, consider yourself a superhero fan or even like superheroes to the point you see every live action movie release - you need to see this movie.     It will capture you from beginning to end and is worth every penny. I've watched it a few times. If you're going to pick just one DCU movie to see what they're about, this is the one. If you've previously purchased a DCU movie, were not overly pleased and plan on giving up on them - BUY THIS MOVIE to give it another shot. You won't regret it.
0385732554|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book! It has new meaning each time I read it and I'll continue to enjoy it throughout my life.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|i love this movie. before i bought it i watched it everytime it's on tv.. sandra bullock is funny as hell and i esp love the fireside sceen..
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I am so happy with this product! My daughter (7 yrs old) and I love Glee, and to be able to buy it at $15.00 (more or less) was an absolute steal! Amazon.com has always proven itself over and over again with their prices.<br /><br />Not only do you get every episode but there are many other little extras and special features that any true Gleek would love to have. I can't wait for Season 2 to be out on DVD.<br /><br />Oh, and I believe that buying the complete season, rather than just the volumes, is way better. But that's just my opinion.
0142410314|5.0|My kids are 5 and 7 and both of them loved every second of this story.  They were thoroughly engaged from page one and couldn't wait to get back to it every night.  The combination of bratty little villain kids in such a magnificent world as Willy Wonka's factory, along with the funny little Oompa Loompas and imaginative scenes made this a perfect kids' read.  They couldn't wait to find out how the next bad kid was going to get what was coming to him (or her)... and they were equally excited to see how things were going to turn out for little Charlie Bucket in the end.  Each crazy invention in Wonka's factory seemed to spark their imagination more than the one before.  In other words... this story is pure magic for children.  The thing that I appreciated was that the book was littered with funny quotes and moments that kept me, as an adult reader, as thoroughly entertained as the kids were.  The Oompa Loompa songs in particular were a highlight for me.  As anxious as my kids were to find out what was going to happen to the next kid, I was more anxious to see how the Oompa Loompas were going to immortalize the moment in song.<br /><br />As an aside... When we had finished reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we had a movie night at our house and watched \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" (the Gene Wilder movie).  Afterward, I heard my kids having a surprisingly thoughtful discussion about how the movie differed from the book.  Talk about music to a book-loving mother's ears!  I am so happy that our summer reading started with this book.  It couldn't have been a better choice.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  Best.  Children's Book.  Ever.  If you haven't read it already, get busy.  If it's been a while... read it again.  [This review originally appeared on my blog, The Lit Witch: A Book Blog.  See profile for a link.]
030746363X|5.0|Love the book.  I've been stuck around the same lifting weights for 10 years and needed a go-to book for some assistance.  Currently doing Occam's protocol and feeding (eating 4000 calories a day is a job) and after I get my strength gains I'm moving to the slow carb diet and getting a visible six pack.     Much obliged for the book Tim!
0751529818|5.0|That is all I have to say. One of the best books to read. It's a quick read full of great lessions on life.
B0041KOVNM|5.0|What we have here is traditional 70's inspired pyschedelic heavy rock with holographic clean vocals and organ. VOVOID did not enter my mind here nor did Mercyful Fate but I guess I can throw in Blue Oyster Cult. I was actually thinking PINK FLOYD's PIPER at the GATES of DAWN but 10 times heavier.    Overall, a very good listen and very highly recommended for those that love the 70's heavy and swirly thing. The last two songs are worth the purchase of this disc and can be counted as one song.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I just finished writing a review for another movie with the same title, which I accidentally rented with the intention of seeing this film! I love all kinds of movies, and I typically choose them depending on my mood. This fully delivered on my high expectations for an action/adventure film featuring a very impressive cast.    Morgan Freeman: what is there not to love about him? Bruce Willis brings so much life to every character he plays, and continually draws me in to not only choosing to watch, but also loving movies that I would never have considered before seeing \\"Die Hard.\\" It would take me all night to even touch on the accomplishments of so many of the actors in this film.    One character I found very endearing was Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox), the long lost love of Victoria (Helen Mirren). He was so charming and I kept wondering who the actor was.     After I watched this, I immediately viewed the movie I had accidentally rented, Red (2008). It's a brutal, sad and touching story that I'll never forget. And then when I did my usual \\"actor search\\" afterward, I was totally blown away by the fact that Brian Cox was the star of that film.    If you have an appreciation for a broad spectrum of movie genres, watch them both!          was the star of .
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Stranger than Fiction is an excellent movie which casually brings to mind the quandries of modern physics as we tackle the meaning and essence of time and being; the social qualities of class values & norm differentials, and even the value set on human life itself (as measured by academics)... then I watched it a second time (with popcorn, beer, and a hot dog) and had fun, I laughed a lot/teared up a little, and thought how great the experience, craftmanship of these movie makers is.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is simply wonderful. The new animations that come out are relatable to children and also to their parents taking them to see the movie. The humor is simple and pleasing for both audiences. The price on Amazon was amazing. It was so good that I could not pass it up. I was interested in buying the DVD, but didn't really get around to it until I saw this great deal.
0062015176|4.0|Exactly as I hoped it would be, perfect condition, and it arrived in a timely manner.  A must have for those who love literature and art!
B002ZG980U|5.0|Like I said, mind blowing, epic and downright amazing. The concept for this movie will have you thinking about it days after watching it. Every time I watch it I come up with new explanations for the unsettling ending. I will NOT give anything away, just that what happens in the last 5 seconds will make you re-think what you just sat through for 2 hours..but in an awesome way. Definitely a movie that makes you think, but it keeps you interested the whole way through. Definitely a great movie.
B004GNYGTI|2.0|Angelina Jolie plays a spy with a secret - go figure.  The problem is, that she may actually be a sleeper agent from the Soviet Union with designs on bringing down the US of A.  The whole 'is she or isn't she' theme wore thin really quick and about two thirds of the way through, I nearly gave up.  But I figured I had invested that much time and I needed to see it through.  I should have quit, because the end took me from indifferent to angered.  There were a few decent action sequences, but there's no way I'd recommend this confused film to anybody.    I'm not a hardcore Angelina Jolie fan, but have enjoyed most of the action films that she's headed up.  Salt was certainly the exception to the rule.  Do yourself a favor and just tape the next Bond marathon on BBC for your spy fix.  Salt will just leave you wishing you could recapture those lost two hours.
0738702994|5.0|This is a reasonably priced deck with attractive and evocative images.  The cards have a soothing dreamy quality which I find enhances my intuition when doing a reading.  If you are familiar with the Rider Waite deck, you will feel quite at home with this one.  In addition, the author gives a \\"Welsch twist\\" to the cards, which you can read about in the accompanying book.  The cards are a little larger than the typical tarot deck and some readers may find them a bit hard to shuffle.  Overall I enjoy this deck and would recommend it, especially if you like the images.  Fortunately you can view some of the cards here on amazon.com to decide if you like them before deciding to make the purchase.  The more I use this deck, the more I like it.  I wish the cards were a little smaller and easier to handle.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|For the past month I've been experimenting with the Garmin Forerunner 405CX. It was a Christmas gift to myself after MultiSportFit.com  trainer Sal Palmieri recommended that I invest in a sports watch with a heart rate monitor (I will explain and review MultiSportFit.com in a future post).    Now I've never been one to be super analytical with statistics, time, pace, etc. Hell, up until the last couple of years I usual ran naked sans watch at whatever pace and time \\"felt\\" good. So I was super hesitant to buy a Garmin because number one, they are ridiculously expensive and number two, I'm afraid of becoming \\"that guy\\" with his workout charts and annoying watch beeping constantly.    I narrowed down my options fairly quickly. I knew I wanted the Garmin name brand. I've trusted Garmin in other activities including Aviation, Fishing and Hiking so I'm partial and loyal to them. I don't want a Star Trek Communicator on my wrist so that eliminated a lot of the Garmin sports watches. I'm really only interested in pace, time and distance so the Forerunner 110 seemed the logical choice. It's the minimalist GPS watch and a heart rate monitor is optional (which Sal seems to be really interested in heart rate data) so it looked like it is the obvious choice. Then I saw the Forerunner 405CX on sale marked down to about the same price as the 110, probably because Garmin launched a new model at an ultra ridiculous price. Long story short; I hesitantly purchased the 405CX on sale for $199.    After three weeks running with this watch I think I'm in love. It was easy to set up on my computer, which it wireless uploads the workouts I've completed without me even asking. And, the best part? That data is synced with not only the Garmin website, but also others like DailyMile.com, MapMyRun.com and MultiSportFit.com. That right there saves me SO much time. I will admit that I haven't even read the instructions manual and I've only focused on the things I care about like time, distance andpace. The heart rate information is interesting (at one point I had a heart rate of 50 while sitting on the couch!). The mapping is mind blowing. Garmin will overlay the route of the workout to Google Earth and when I zoom in I can see things like me crossing the road to get away from someone walking a poodle.    I'm sure I'll learn more about it and myself as time goes by, but for now I'm stoked. It seems like the right choice and if I ever want to use all the other amazing features this watch provides it's there for me.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love this movie and this version of it. Ruth Wilson is perfect for this role. Not a classical beauty, but she can look either plain,  or lovely, charming and very attractive as she wishes. Perfect scary creepy atmosphere; beautifully filmed. Wonderful!
0307272702|4.0|I did the Atkins diet about 10yrs ago and it worked, but when I got pregnant I stopped.  Always felt a little weird about Atkins because I didn't know why it worked. This book clears all that up with facts and scienc and I feel confident about trying a low carb diet again.  Thanks!
B00275EHJG|5.0|As far as sequels go, this one takes the cake. The characters of Toy Story have come to life once again in this animated heart-warming film. Although new characters are added, they seem to help the story rather than hinder it. The plot is far from predictable and keeps you on your toes the whole way through. You will laugh, you will cry, you will get angry. But all in all, you will come away loving the story even more than the first one. Definitely a top-of-the-list recommendation!
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Harry Potter movies are for people who enjoy an escape from the seemingly never ending demands of adult problems,weather social.economic and or,work related.This movie does what it sets out to do,namely give you some entertainment without a lot of ooooh!the world is full of people suffering and we all are sub-standard human beings for not joining them or rushing out and trying to change the whole into what we think(HA-HA)it should be.If you want some entertainment and to escape your troubles this fantasy of good versus evil fun and I really enjoyed a couple of hours of good clean fun.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I ordered this JUST before Christmas and was amazed at how quickly it arrived! It was a belated gift for my son and it was all he hoped for and more.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was upset that the Blu-Ray release of episodes 4-6 was taking so long.  When they announced a release date I was excited until I realized that they are the \\"enhanced\\" editions.  I'm surprised that AMPAS hasn't sounded off on this subject.  While some changes to movies are arguably minor, what's to stop a director from making significant changes to a film that won an Academy Award for best picture?  A version of the film that was not even evaluated now carries their seal of approval.  I'm not saying that any changes should be forbidden but the original versions should always be available.  I could almost convince myself to buy this product if it wasn't for the Greedo scene in the cantina.  I found that change to be so offensive that I don't want to spend money for a version that includes it.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I just picked up a new 42\\" 1080p LG TV so naturally I needed a Blu-ray player and thus I needed something to watch. So I choose this as the very first thing to pop into my new setup. I was interested in this series after viewing [[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]] on a friends Blu-ray setup. This is a perfect for the nature lover or even just the casual viewer. My wife and I enjoy the narration and the camera work is stunning. Some scenes make me stop and say, \\"WOW, how did I ever watch stuff like this in standard definition!\\" This is a very worthy investment for your collection. It also includes some animals that I have never seen before, and this is very nice because some other documentaries get a little drab after showing the same things over and over again. In conclusion, get this the BBC has another winner.    Pros:  Great narration  Excellent camera work  Blu-ray quality is fabulous    Cons:  Not as good as Planet Earth, but still very good  Weird menu, cannot select episodes individually without going to scene selection
B002WYJHBA|5.0|When Blu first started one of the main films that came to my mind for hopeful clarity test and color contrast was this one. Tons of chances for a fail - but in the end another fun movie with a solid preservation. Skipping a content review of the already known film, this is just a BD quip.<br /><br />The colors and black & white sequences look great. Tested the disc on both LCD and plasma displays with side-by-side comparisons of the DVD release. There was a significant and noticeable clarity increase with the pixelations removed/being cleared up from the old version. The line definition looked solid and only showed the falterings from original filming regarding color vs. no color sequences. Pause checked both rose scenes and several town window scenes to observe the fine detail (text, labels) and reflection improvements (so much so that myself and customers alike noticed a few flies buzzing around on actors that did not readily appear in the DVD version). Make-up lines and eye reflections are clearer and the only other noticeable failings are with some out-of-focus scenes and one or two quick movement sequences (umbrella twirling, etc.).<br /><br />The DTS is center channel heavy but the music is mixed to the outer realms nicely, with only a few surprising surrounds during the bowling alley scenes and one other shot. The special features are brought over from the [[ASIN:6305308659 Pleasantville (New Line Platinum Series)]] release sans the computer features. Worth the upgrade for the price listed. Hope you enjoy.
B00008973A|4.0|having seen both the original Chorus Line on broadway, and this movie version....I can only say what some of the original cast members said about this production.  It was done very well.  Music is spectacular, but some of the leads are a joke.  Tits and Ass production number is great, but using that sad actress \\"Landers\\" was a mistake.  Good flick for a sat night.  Sit back and enjoy.
B000127LW2|4.0|As a die-hard Trek fan, I watched the entire 7 seasons of Voyager when it originally aired.  At the time, I was a bit disappointed in the show.  It seemed like a bit of a Next Gen retread, and some of the characters were annoying (like Neelix, who was Trek's equivalent of Jar Jar Binks).  I also grew weary of the constant techno-babble and the way every crew member seemed to be totally proficient in PHD level astro-physics.    Anyway, I bought the DVD set mostly because I got a great deal on it at Walmart, but was pleasantly surprised at how good it was in 2011.  All the stuff that annoyed me before didn't seem so bad now that the show has some distance from its predecessors.  It was also refreshing to see a show which aimed high from a moral standpoint and openly defended their principles no matter what the cost.  Most of the recent sci-fi shows are far more complex and ambiguous in that respect, so it's nice to see a command crew that isn't saddled with all kinds of personal demons and conflicting agendas.    I also liked Kate Mulgrew a lot more this time around.  Where I found her abrasive before I now see her as bold and decisive.  And one of the coolest things about this set is the bonus disc that contains footage of the original actress (Catherine Bujold) who was tapped to play Janeway.  I remember reading about her back when this aired.  They said she couldn't handle the rigors of filming a weekly TV show, and quit after only one week of shooting. But after watching the videos of her, it's clear that she was let go because she wasn't suited to the part at all, and Kate Mulgrew is brilliant by comparison.    One knock on this set is the video quality, which is not great by today's high-def standards.  Like STNG and DS9, it was shot on film but the final edits were done on video tape.  So the final \\"masters\\" are of inferior quality, and the only way to fix it is to go back and rebuild the special effects + live action compilation from scratch using modern technology.  From what I've read, there's no plan to do that (not surprising, as Paramount is always dragging its feet and Voyager wasn't that popular to begin with). So odds are, this set is as good as it will get anytime soon.      As others have pointed out, the packaging is a bit on the flimsy side, but it's not as bad as some reviewers have suggested.  As long as it's handled carefully, the box and colored panels hold up well enough and the whole thing looks really cool in the box.      So all in all, I'd give this a thumbs up.  The price has come down to a reasonable amount, and the bonus disc has a bunch of cool interviews with the producers, along with the original Janeway footage mentioned above.  Unfortuately, this set is new very hard to find out in retail world.  Music & video stores are on the decline in general, and the only big-box retailed I know of who carried Voyager was Walmart (and they dropped it from their inventory last year).  So at this point, it's pretty much Amazon or Ebay if you want to buy this set new.  And if you get it from Amazon, at least you'll know that you can easily exchange it if you do happen to receive a damaged box.  I'd get it while you can - this probably is out of print and whatever copies are left are all there will be for quite some time.

067144901X|5.0|At first I was dissapointed with this book as I expected a longer story,but after reading it to my little girl who is 16 months old and seeing her do the noises for the animals so quickly, I loved it and now know it off by heart.My Daughter really enjoys this book and it has become a firm favorite.This is the first book she really likes.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|With an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, Nina (Natalie Portman) looses herself in a once in a lifetime performance. Portman's acting skills are worthy of an Oscar for best actress in this twisted tale of the classis ballet \\"Swan Lake.\\" Trained in dance since age 4, Portman's dancing is breathtaking and visually stunning. Actress Mila Kunis, (The Book of Eli) is perfectly cast as the evil twin sister.  Kunis continues to show Hollywood why she will be around for many years to come. Veteran actresses Barbara Hershey and Winona Rider round out the supporting cast with small roles. If a person understands the art of movement and facial expression to tell a story, \\"Black Swan\\" should be on the must see list. 5 potato 6 potato
1595141715|5.0|Hannah Baker is dead.   End of story.   Right?   Wrong.  As Clay Jensen, the boy who loved her from afar, finds out, her story is about to unfold.     It begins when Clay receives a package with no return address.  Inside are seven cassette tapes.  And on those cassette tapes are the thirteen reasons why Hannah Baker killed herself.   Clay is one of them.   As he starts to listen, he starts to see the world around him in a different way- the way Hannah saw it.  And what he finds devastates him.     This book should be required reading for every teenager, male or female.  It gets to readers in a way that not many books of this type can - for we can all place ourselves in the role of one of the characters in this book, be it the petty thief, to the terrified victim, to the supposedly innocent bystander.  Throughout Hannah's story, only a single motif stands out:     It's not about your actions, nor their motivation.   It's about their consequences.
031603438X|5.0|Who knew a mind so fractionated could function so well on so many levels? A great glimpse into the mind of one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Unlike other rock biographies, Richards weaves a predictable tale of excess while still managing to retain a certain charm, charisma, a sense of self and assuring the reader that that humanity, however flawed, has such wonderful potential for greatness. Keith is musically gifted and has had such an outrageous trot on this globe and has experienced so much its a blast for the reader to be able to experience it all through his book. I really like Keith- he is an interesting person with an interesting mind and I would have read the book with equal voraciousness had I not known who was writing it. That alone speaks volumes. I agree with other reviewers that the first third of the book is the best. One of the most interesting aspects of the book for me as a fan was seeing how the music is created- Keith involves you in what inspires him, what his experiences are and in the mechanics of how he and Mick and the other band members interact and bring the listener the final product which is always so mysterious to me. He isn't just a moron with talent- you really get this rich textural experience of who he is and how he's weaved his fascinating ride through countries and eras and cultures on this planet into the sounds we fans treasure so much.  I've listened to all my Stones CD's with renewed interest and appreciation after this read. One of the things that has always amazed me about the Stones is their ability to create such consistently quality music and in such quantity over such an extended period of time. They somehow manage to re-invent themselves and their music to be relevant decade after decade while remaining true to their core. They aren't afraid of change musically and to hear the evolution of sound in their music  from Sympathy for the Devil all the way to Waiting on a Friend is one of the best things about them; Keith's fluidity and lust for life and every experience it has to offer is one of the many things that you can't help but think has made it all possible. They watch fads come and go and take what they like from them and leave what they don't but always remain true to what they are: an historic rock n roll band made up of tremendously talented, vibrant and yes, flawed people whose music influenced generations of people across the globe. Pretty awesome.Keith's fluidity and lust for life and every experience it has to offer is one of the many things that you can't help but think has made it all possible.

0385341679|1.0|I enjoy reading for several reasons; sometimes it's to challenge my mind and sometimes it's to escape my own reality for a time. The later reason is why I love this genre-I want to ride in the magical world the author creates.     In all honesty I've never been completely captivated with this series, but I continued to delve into Moning's world because I love a good mystery. With this latest installment, my frustration reached its zenith. I have several gripes with the series and novel. I have difficulty understanding the actions of Mack, and I'm weary of her constant whining...     However, I think, what truly angers me is the whole 'reality' the author has created. Moning has created a world where nothing is what it appears to be. The actions, motivations, words, and even Mack's own eyes cannot be trusted. At the end of the book, we are given some answers, but who truly knows? The author even encourages this feeling with her not-so-cryptic ending \\"The end...or is it?\\" In a world such as this, what is true? Throughout the book there are quotes from T.S. Eliot about illusions, shadows, etc. Yet ironically in several of his works Eliot discusses the importance of the 'still point' referring the stationary leg of a compass. Whether it is one's family, friends, or faith Eliot understood the necessity of having something that grounds you, something one can be certain of. In this novel nothing is certain; there is nothing the reader 'can take to the bank.' Moreover, because there are no certainties anything can change, or become significant in the last moments--despite being completely vague or seemingly related to something else when mentioned in an early book. Moning has created a world where she can change nearly anything at a moment's notice, including her explanations for why things are happening. But rather than these twists and turns creating a more interesting story, I'm left with a snarl full of ups and downs, false starts, 360 turns, annoying detours into unnecessary flashbacks or self reflections, and twisting traps. And I am left wondering... Are these the characteristics of good, intriguing writing? Or, is it just a snarl without substance, not worth detangling? Unfortunately, I think it's the later.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|*May contain spoilers, but not detailed*  I have enjoyed the resident evil movie series ever since the first one came out. The made for movie character,, Alice kind of threw me off at first but Milla totally owns this role and adds to the Resident Evil mix. This 4th installment however, seemed a slight bit lacking. Having watched it only on DVD and not in the theater, this review is based on seeing it only in 2D at home and not in 3D at theater (the way it was probably meant to be seen.)    Pros :   Zombies, Zombies, Zombies   Awesome (sometimes over the top) action sequences start from the opening scene.  It's Milla AND Resident Evil in another zombie killing action flick  Picks up right after the end of RE:3 Extinction  The movie ends wide open. Leaving it open for the 5th installment      Cons :  Most of the CG Elements looked a few notches above a typical SciFi Channel made for TV movie. ie: Weskers dogs(as if they spent more money on shooting the film with James Camerons 3D digital filming methods and equipment rather than giving the attention to the CG portions to make it look more realistic. \\"Realistic\\" is used loosely of course.)  Though this movie has more zombies than the other films, the interaction with them was minimal.    If you have not been following the movie series I believe I can safely say, this movie is gonna suck to you. Just like the beginning of every RE movie so far, Mila narrates at the beginning catching all watchers up to speed with what has been happening, but if you are just jumping in to the series with this 4th installment, you won't become attached to the characters and won't care much for the film as since there is really no character building in this one. As a fan of the series, I was slightly satisfied with it. The pros are equal to the cons in my opinion, but only if you've been following the series. I read reviews saying, \\"If you are a fan of the movie franchise, you will love this\\"...But I disagree, I'm a huge fan of the moviefranchise, but this film left me feeling unfulfilled. I can only hope the 5th one, presumably the last one, ends with a bang and they throw out everything they can into it.    I give this movie a 2 1/2 stars...not 3, but amazon only allows full star ratings, not fractions. It's ok. Nothing spectacular, but still a nice romp through the Resident Evil world.
B003L20IHE|5.0|The whole moving had me thinking about life and what we make of it, but the ending......well, I didn't see it coming!  Most movies, I can see the ending coming, but this one took me by surprise.  A movie that can do that, ......it's just good plotting.
B00005JKHP|3.0|You may have heard the theory that \\"only the even Trek films are good\\" ST:TMP is an odd # and it is a weak ST film. It is important because it was a reuniting of the TV cast (in fact the picture almost starts like the Magnificent Seven collecting bridge crew vets), and the Big budget take on the show was worth the effort... It may take it self too seriously at times, especially in the extended cut, and the beauty passes of the Enterprise seem endless as do the V'Ger clould/ sphincter shots, and the story is sort of a recycled script (Changling)...  but I fondly remember seeing this in the theater.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I am totally engrossed in this book (which I am reading on the Kindle), but I must admit that I am getting very confused with the different characters. Not only do their names all look the same, but they also have \\"nicknames\\" & titles that confuse the issue even more. I think another reviewer (of the print version) mentioned an appendix which listed the characters. I could really use this with the Kindle. And then there is a map in the print edition--couldn't that have been included with the Kindle download?<br /><br />I would be much more inclined to continue the series if there were just a few more guidelines available to use Kindlers... Any plans for helping us out in the future?
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|when i got the disc and saw its a 2 disc bluray i thought both disc is loaded with extras but actually 1st disc is just the movie with 2 commentaries while disc 2 is the 2 hour extras. this can easily be fit into 1 disc.i think Sony should follow Universal by having bluray/DVD/digital copy format
0316077054|5.0|BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS is a magnificently woven web of love, pain, and magic that captures the reader instantly. Lena's transformation is brillantly chronicled while the true reason for it is masterfully concealed until Ethan's own transformation is evolved. The characters, plot, and climax of the book are so intense that readers will dream themselves into the story for weeks after closing the cover. It is easy to believe that Garcia and Sthol's Caster world exists \\"hidden in plain sight\\" in the South. I truely loved this book, as well as the first installment BEAUTIFUL CREATURES, and look forward to re-reading both again and again. The next chapter in THE CASTER CHRONICLES is highly anticipted, but until then, I will just keep dreaming of BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS.

0385341679|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the final book to this series. It left me satisfied, but still a little saddened that the series ended. However, I'm glad Moning didn't drag the series out, as some authors tend to do.
B0034G4P7Q|2.0|Interesting tale of how a jealous, hateful, geek nerd screws his only friend, and others, out of the Facebook business.  Eisenberg is the quintesssential geek, nerd anyway.  Just see \\"The Squid and the Whale.\\"  Same actor and essentially the same part.  The geek, nerd just had to show up for filming and say a few lines.

1416550550|5.0|Let me start by simply saying, I LOVE THIS BOOK!  I could not put it down.  With that being said, be forewarned, if you do not like a book that jumps around in time and follows multiple story lines simultaneously, this is not the book for you.  This novel is constantly interchanging throughout four different periods: 1900, 1913, 1976 and 2005.  At times it can be confusing, but Morton does a spectacular job at weaving the chapters together seamlessly.<br /><br />This book is well over 500 pages so it is probably not recommended for a \\"light\\" read, but if you are looking for a captivating, fun, historical read, this is a great option.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines from the book:<br />\\"Memory is a cruel mistress with whom we all must learn to dance.\\" - Kate Morton The Forgotten Garden
B002NXSRVG|1.0|My dad and I saw this in the Dollar theater and at the half point of the movie,we left.Too much mindless action,no story,this should be on TV!I mean,who in the world would give this movie 5 stars?!Even if my life depended it,I WILL NOT BUY OR RENT THIS FILM!
0767802519|5.0|This all time favourite never seems to pall, with an amazing performance from a very young Natalie Portman forshadowing a great career ahead of her with Jean Reno as the unexpected and unlikely hero make an interesting partnership.  Gary Oldman is (as usual) skin crawlingly brilliant as the villian of the piece. The violence is a little extreme in places but not necessarily gratuitous. Thoroughly enjoyable, this quirky and odd film charms and entertains.
B000JML90Y|1.0|Darwin says that if we find out that the cell is not simple, then his whole theory is destroyed.  We now know that the living cell is more complex than our most advanced computer systems.  It is impossible for the cell to have one part removed and for it to work. So it is irreducibly complex.  Read this book and you will find out that Darwin himself disproves the theory of evolution.
