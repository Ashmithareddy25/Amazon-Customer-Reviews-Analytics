B007XKEY6Q|1.0|EDIT - The game is virtually unplayable with the \\"multiple devices\\" error.  I have done some more research and the developers seem to have made no effort to fix it.  Extremely disappointing.<br /><br />This is a great game that is marred by a continuous error; \\"It looks like you are playing Draw Something on more than one device,\\" etc.  Then your current drawing is thrown out and you have to start over.  I have Googled the error and it is seemingly a known issue that has been around for a while.<br /><br />If you can get past this, you will definitely enjoy the game.  It is a lot of fun!
B00G70WLJA|1.0|I could not stand this movie.  Perhaps it was the look of constant consternation on Hugh Jackman's face?  I have been a huge fan of Xmen and Wolverine for many, many years but I just found this whole thing to be predictable, cliche and boring.<br /><br />Just my thoughts.
1781162646|5.0|Very Fun read.  Joyland Park appears to be in many states, perhaps under different names. A haunting read. If you have never read SK, this would be a good one to start. Not too long, but realistic life experience read.
B005LAII80|5.0|I love this Movie, but I tell my friends to watch the movie, &#34;The Raid&#34;.  I'm sorry to say, but they almost took this Story entirely From that movie.  There are changes here and there, but I saw, &#34;The Raid&#34; Before this came out and I love them both, but they have are almost the same Movie.
1476727651|5.0|The characters come alive in your mind and you feel as if you are there with them. Great story, as usual for SK.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Some People didn't like this because of the ending, not to spoil it for anyone, but lets be realistic here if Superman would fight a small army of Kryptonians, they would cause the amount of damge and deaths that happened.  The old Superman Movies Superman would take time out of the fight to make sure everyone was alright or people would get out of a bus that was thrown down the street like in Superman 2, when we all know it would probably have killed everyone on the bus.  This is A Superman set in the real world with real world deavestation.  Superman is trying to save the entire Earth and he doesn't have time to stop in the middle of fighting an army to save each person that's in harms way.  I think this is the Best Superman Movie to come along in a long time and I can't wait for the sequel; Superman vs. Batman, and I don't care what anyone thinks Ben Affleck as Batman is a good fit.  Watch the movie, &#34;The Town&#34; and think about the Batman Described in the next Movie and older more grizzeled Batman that is thinking about getting out of it.  Then say if he is not the best fit for this Batman.
0061950726|5.0|I loved this story about two women, Molly and Vivian so different in age but so similar in what they had experienced and survived  heart break,isolation and extreme hardships. Each  is struggling  to rise above that past. Orphan Train took me thru a part of history, that I never knew existed. It will touch your soul and keep you spellbound from beginning to end. Simply wonderful.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Nice to be able to take pictures on my Kindle. I like the video feature to capture precious moments in my son's life.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|What's to say, all Sherlock, with stories I've not read in forever or never read.  Any sherlock Holmes fan will love this collection, with hours and hours of reading.
B007SGM084|4.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part. My normal taste is for detective/murder mysteries. I read the trilogy and I felt that reading them all at once was long and drawn out but the only way to read them. I read them out of curiosity and they didn't miss the mark on the introduction of an obscure world of sex I knew next to nothing on.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Very similar to Mario. I don't understand the some of the  powers but it's still a fun challenging game. Definitely should try it. Worth it for free.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling, as always, delivers with her beautiful style of writing. This plot wouldn't work at all if it wasn't for the omniscient viewpoint, it makes it much more interesting. I give 5 stars, it had me hooked from the beginning. A juicy plot line with a shocking ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. The levels change with the holidays. It just freezes on occasion, easily fixed by turning your device on and off/redownloading the app. Challenges keep it interesting and by completing them you can earn coin.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|If you are interested in Virtue's Last Reward you MUST absolutely play 999 first. Not only my favorite ds game but definitely in my top 5 video-game series list. The zero escape series are an absolute gem in storytelling, several sleepless nights during and after playing the game, it's really that good. This is the first in the series of the trilogy (the third installment coming soon) and the story line in 999 once unraveled is so good and complete it could stand on its own.After playing the game you will feel as if your part of an elite secret society and your mind never looking at every day life the same way. Absolutely play this if you own a ds you will absolutely not regret it but stay far away from the internet as possible when playing this game because the twists and turns will be so worth it if they remained unspoiled. Just remember 18+ to play. 1+8=[9]
B004SBQAN8|4.0|If you enjoy fantasy and science fiction you'll definitely enjoy this film not only because it contains just that, but more importantly the movie contains real human interests with actors playing their parts well enough to pull off the fantasy and science fiction and still keep their feet on the ground (no pun intended). Despite there being aliens, which I believe are more real then many other alien movies, they do get blown up. Hooray for the good guys. Unfortunately, since they don't seem to be making a sequel, we'll never know who wins. Though I guess with most predictable movies the good guy wins, right?
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is life! - And the way we should be conducting ourselves...What a wonderful guide to living & understanding....thank you Don Miguel Ruiz!!!
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|It's so much fun -- I've been following and enjoying it every week. It's ordinary people hnndling fantastic people and items, and that gets my interest at once. I like the cast and Clark Gregg is wonderful. So is Ming-no!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun you can buy horses and compete in companies<br />And  visit other people Including your friends they have a lot of horses including<br />Unicorns.
B00DJYJQ36|5.0|Before Midnight may just be a perfect movie. After seeing it twice, I can't find a flaw in its writing, acting, or rhythms. I don't know how this one plays if you haven't seen the first two movies in this trilogy, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, both of which are also great. But this one tops them because this one has that incredibly difficult scene in the hotel room (no spoilers here).<br /><br />If you describe the premise of the trilogy to anyone unfamiliar with them, their eyes glaze over: two twenty/thirty/forty-somethings (depending on which film) meet, walk around and talk for an hour and a half.<br /><br />One of the greatest cinematic treats of the last twenty years is taking an afternoon/evening and watching all three back-to-back.
B00632HWOG|1.0|They changed the format of the whole thing and now it has errors and also is difficult to navigate.  They need a way to go back to the old format.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|makes locating anything you have added to your Kindle findable. Whether its a pdf, word doc, video etc.. The Kindle easily finds mobi files etc, but anything different could be a  dhallenge
0812986180|2.0|I was shocked at how boring I found this book to be! I've not seen the tv series but heard great things so I decided to try out the book first. I figured it would be compelling and full of juicy details about prison. Instead, it sounds like Piper had a pretty decent time in \\"the Camp\\". Every woman she met there is described as generally friendly and supportive. They are thoughtful of each other and throw each other birthday parties and always help each other out. As some other reviewers have hinted at, she makes her experience sound like it was basically a crappy summer camp. But yet the point of her book is to show the horrors of prison. Just not what I was expecting. I would still be happy to give the tv series a try as I gather it's much more entertaining.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE books!!!  Our book club chose the book to read one month and EVERYONE had the same feeling about &#34;Fearless&#34;.  I even sent an email to all my friends urging them to read the book. (I've NEVER done that before!)  I've had several of these people to either write me or stop me and say, &#34;WOW!!&#34;  What a patriot!!  What a family!  What an American!  You won't be able to put the book down.  You will smile, laugh, hold your breath, and CRY!!!  How could we EVER thank his family for his service!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love the graphics and the easy game playing. Keep up the good work. Just love it and it's easier to play then the one one computer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't stop playing. Working on 400,,almost to the end ,,,hope they make new levels. This is very addictive, love candy crush
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|We love Tiana!  My daughters love the story and especially the music.  Another great movie by Disney.  They never fail!
0316204366|5.0|He finds stories that entertain the heck out of the reader; not meant to be deeply thought provoking, just fun stuff
B00064WSN2|5.0|Yes, in many ways this album is very similar to Court, but is that such a bad thing? If, like me, Court is one of the Crimso cuts you keep coming back to, all the more reason to purchase this one! It seems that a lot of listeners tend to pass this second album off for sounding too much like the first. I agree that it does, but my argument involves turning that statement of its head, so to speak. While I can see how it would be slightly more underwhelming back in 1970 to get this directly after King Crimson's legendary debut, I believe that, like a fine wine, time has aged this item into something much better than it seemed to have been. Instead of looking at this as a Copy of its predecessor, try to look at it as an ALTERNATE TAKE on it. This should be PRAISED for it's similarities to Court, not denied and overlooked. Want another session in the court of the crimson king? Follow behind in the wake of poseidon... and do I even need to say anything about the single &#34;Cat Food&#34;?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I started this book thinking it was going to be another run of the mill book.  But I was wrong, I loved the way the author presented the characters as, looking from the outside, each thought the other was the &#34;together&#34; person.  It shows we can be so wrong about other people and what we think they are thinking.  I loved the inner dialog each person had.  I will certainly recommend to my friends and I will buy her books again.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Instead of reading these reviews, take a leap of faith and buy this album. You will NOT be sorry you jumped. The court is now in session...
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very fun! I used to play this a lot on Facebook but the quests got to be too much to handle. This version is much better because it lets you have all of the fun without the complicated quests.
B000002O1P|3.0|Tom Petty is a genius and a true talen. We all know that. This is not his best effort but it is well worth your collection if you are a fan.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is one of the best movies I ever saw. François Cluzet is a wonderful actor. Omar Sy is unbelievable. I recommend this movie and the book also.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is a fantastic band with a fantastic and original sound. There is no mistaking the singer and his style and the bands musical abilities and delivery. This band rapidly rose in popularity so most of you do not need a review to know what these guys are all about. Just know that if you have not heard much from this group and you like a Folk type blues rock feel then you will enjoy this CD and band. You will like or love them.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Spoiler alert!!! Though I hoped Katniss would end up with Gale, I still really enjoyed the last book in the Hunger Games trilogy! I simply could not put this book down, I had to know how it ended, hours and hours of reading only to put the book down when the words got so blurry I could not make them out anymore.  Would highly recommend this book, this trilogy, to anyone who likes action and adventure.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best game ever to kill time if your a hunter...My friends and I play it at coffee and lunch breaks...lol Ironworkers local 29 love this game on the Kalama job!  Great fun!!!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Amazing album, I highly recommend buying it. She is a mix of Lana Del Ray and Florence and the Machine. Not a song on the album that I didn't like. Hope this helps!!
B000001FDK|4.0|What can I say about a CD of the songs from one of my favorite musicals.  The tunes are catchy, and I enjoy thinking about the movie as I listen.<br /><br />Good quality CD plays well.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book....not as much as the first two, but it is still amazing definitely a tissue needing book. I haven't cried Thu  much since reading Mocking Jay or the last few books of Harry Potter. it's  not easy to make me cry but Veronica Roth has done it. Fantastic book!
B000002AVF|5.0|This Is the greatest album of all time. Words cannott describe how amazing this album is. This album is 1000x better than sgt peppers lonely hearts club and thriller combined!!!!!!!
B00GINENG0|5.0|My Talking Tom is one of the best because it is like taking care of a REAL BABY BOY but it is easier to take care of Tom then a real Baby
0307887448|5.0|Simply amazing.  I started reading and literally couldn't put it down.  And I mean that in the actual sense of the word, none of this &#34;figurative&#34; nonsense.  This book is easily among my favorites now.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have enjoyed this series. The end was not what I expected. It has been a great read. I am interested in more of your books
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I truly enjoy this game. So many friends kept talking about how addictive it is... finally I decided to try it! Addictive indeed, in fact the only thing I would change is making it to where you can get power up without real money and earning lives quicker.... But over all great!!!!
B00FOWX6NM|3.0|It looks good and useful but i thought it gold but what i get almost brown but finally i like.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game. Tho I wish u were rewarded power ups instead of always having to purchase. It would make the game perfect
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I hate it when the &#34;FREE APP OF THE DAY&#34; is the already FREE version and for it to work, you have to pay for a &#34;PRO&#34; version.<br /><br />I call it FALSE ADVERTISING.  I won't give any money (or access to my hardware & data) to cheating scum.
B00E9A656K|5.0|By far the best drag racing game. 5 different tiers of cars. Tons of cars to buy and you upgrade your cars. There are also five different bosses that you need to beat overtime.<br />The only downside of the game is you need gas, which is basically energy. Other than this it is an awesome game.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|I don't really like the lay out of this app. It is much easier to read as a web page.
0788859544|1.0|I couldn't wait to receive this movie as it was supposed to be a birthday gift for my daughter. It took 3 attempts to get sent to me. When I finally got it the printing on the cover looks funny and for some reason the case doesn't fit in its sleeve... the movie is supposedly better quality but looks boot legged. My niece has the same movie purchased from a Wal-Mart and it looks like it's better quality. I've never had a problem with purchasing anything from amazon and I am a frequent customer very disappointed with this purchase :(
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has much more features and you haters go to hell this game is awesome I got a score of 10,000,000 I have like 1,000,000 gems and like 3,000,000 money this game IS EPIC BUY IT ITS WORTH IT
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I like the fact that I can use it without connecting to the internet and that there are some translations to other languages.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|my daughter loved the movie. it was a big hit. she plans to invite friends over to see it too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game so much, I see it in my sleep!!!!  It is highly addictive. Play at your own risk!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Perhaps not for everyone. But it sure filled my imagination and insisted on my own creative translations. Wonderful. Full of wonder.
B00BWYX2MG|3.0|The instructions are pretty clear, I have rather large hands and coated the leather glove twice as instructed, and even did the inside of the fingers. My iphone case prevented the gloves from making proper contact, once I removed the screen protector, the gloves were picked up. While it is far from precise, you can muddle through and type a message, but my primary use is for playing music and doing quick things like changing a station while driving and not having to remove the gloves. If you are buying this product in the hopes of precise typing, it will not happen unless you have extremely tight gloves. The product does work for turning any leather glove into a touchscreen sensitive glove but depending on the gloves you wear will determine how accurate your use is.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I have all cd´s by Allan Jackson, this is a special album. I like Bluegrass and this is a perfect implementation.
1595827684|5.0|This was a gift for my son and he truly enjoys it, he always has it around him, has great pictures as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game it has math and you dont even no it so i play it alot me and my sister does
1609611543|4.0|Was a very interesting read, had no idea how bad this all was for you. Now if i could just follow it......
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This movie is action packed from the get go and gives a fresh spin to the zombie horror genre.  I don't like to do spoilers, but World War Z does not showcase your typical apathetic, slow moving, dim witted flesh eater that is really only a threat in a large group.  These zombies are fast, fierce, and on certain levels are able to work together to problem solve and reach their objective.  It has been a long time since I watched a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat for its entirety.  This movie was well worth the 99 cent rental fee.  You will not walk away feeling like it is two hours of your life you wish you had back.
1626810915|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a quick and easy read and had so many great tips that I put into use.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|One word - WOW!!!! Okay two more - LOVE IT!!!<br />Great lyrics, especially the choruses praising the Lord, like &#34;He made the blind man see&#34;, and &#34;Cast the devil into swine&#34;, there is POWER in the name of Jesus.<br />Each day I have a favorite, today it is RENEWED!  Take me, Shape me, Break me, Make new renewed&#34; - That is the sinner's prayer, amen?<br />Keep the songs coming Stryper!!!  My prayer is that these songs are played all over, via internet and radio, people need to hear it!
B006S08RLU|5.0|I thought it was charming.  I watched it 4 times in my 24 hour rental time, and like a classic it was fresh every time.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|We loved this movie, so much action and great one liners and comedy! Lots of great actors in this movie!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Loved this game on Facebook so I was so excited to get it for my kindle fire!! Fun to play
B0054JZC6E|5.0|game acidently got deleted had 108 games completed. Had to download again and start over but that's ok games are worth playing again.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love it!  Its soooooo much better then the HD. It has soo many robots. Its so fun. The robots ware awesome.
B0017KIBAI|3.0|Left trigger needed lubrication after only two weeks of use. Granted, I'm playing an APM intensive game and it's working fine now, but it seems like a fitting/alignment problem in manufacturing, and none of the original GC controllers I've played have had this problem, even after years of similar use.<br /><br />Again, it's working fine now. None of the other buttons have given me any issues. This was just an unexpected inconvenience.
0345423496|5.0|Outstanding book, one that you cannot put down once you start reading it! A short evening read developed into a multi-day obsession to finish this 'cannot put it down' book. You will enjoy it too!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I used to play this game on Facebook but I stopped playing when I got my kindle. I saw it thought what hay lets try it and I haven't stopped playing since I got it. :-D
B008LXZFH6|2.0|Insipid toilet humor. One funny  scene when Burgundy plays the jazz flute otherwise i felt embarrassed for wilol Farrell who I usually enjoy.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Used it to center my GPS on my H-D Softail Deluxe. Unlimited adjustment; perfect solution. You can't go wrong with Ram Mounts!
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|it is great cd and there is not for sale in Mexico. I already have de electronic download from iTunes but I wanted the cd from these particular Singer. thank you.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|If I could give this TEN MILLION FREAKING STARS I WOULD!!!!!! omg first of all, Ms. Armentrout you are a spectacular writer. The way you manipulate language and utilize certain situations for humor is unparalleled!<br /><br />I thought his was going to be a noble heartbreaking ending that just left me sad but the ending was perfect. FREAKING PERFECT!!!! and I wouldn't have this any other way. This was an amazing ending to an extraordinary series and my hat goes off to you.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Been looking for a product like this to use in my home, I have a $100 roku, and a $250 sony blu-ray with all the connected apps, and I can say even though there are only 5 apps that are available for the chromecast at the moment (I have heard that the chromecast will be getting a significant amount of apps in the future) its still a great piece of tech, love the chromecast over the roku and sony online apps. The display quality is superb and its only $35!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Remember more apps are to come
B00GH4R95C|1.0|Krypton = Avatar<br />The reset of the movie is Cowboys vs Aliens starring Superman.<br />I would rather watch Superman Returns again.
B0038P59A0|3.0|High budget - nicely filmed - action filled but unfortunately, with rare cinematic glimples, Robert Downy, Jr. is not Sherlock Holmes.  Jude Law on the other hand is a splendid Watson.  Sadly, this film will not hold up over time. The picture is enjoyable but Conan Doyal would have difficulty recognizing it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game for all ages, keeps me occupied for hours. Me and my husband both enjoy it, and its great that it's free too!
B00EOO1RHS|5.0|I have tried MANY different screen protectors and this is by far my favorite one! It was really easy to apply (except that I cannot line the cut outs straight to save my life! but that's MY fault!) There's not a speck of dust anywhere... not a single bubble, nothing. It's perfectly flawless. It feels like the actual iphone screen too which is important to me. I buy the iphone for it's awesome screen and sensitivity (which is why I hate the otterbox defender screen so bad. The instructions are to the point and easy to understand. You cannot tell there is a protector on my phone. Another thing I love that I have never seen before, it's actually hard, like glass... well I guess it is glass, but it's not the little flimsy film like you normally get. It's AWESOME. I actually feel like my phone's screen is truly protected from those deep scratches that previous iphones have had. Oh and to make it even better, the price rocks!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|AMAZING! ALL THE SONGS ARE TO DIFFERENT! AND JUST PERFECT! SHE WORKED 2 YEARS ON THIS ALBUM: LADY GAGA &#34;DANCE SEX ART POP TECH&#34;
B000AP04OM|5.0|Everybody loves this movie, even though it's not exactly true to life, but never let the truth get in the way of a good story.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Free Cell is a game of strategy.  Once played, it became addictive very quickly.  It is much more challenging than regular solitaire.
B003XMAD3G|1.0|Fit properly but only worked sporadically for 5 minutes then unrecognizable by computer.  Clearly defective.  This was the correct memory module for my computer.  Prompt refund provided otherwise would give this zero stars.  My time wasted.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|My daughter, Kayla, is reading this book for school as a required reading. She reads to me a lot and we both enjoy this book and the lessons it teaches young people about acceptance of self and others.
1416550550|3.0|I kind of liked this book, but somehow, never got around to finishing it. It just didn't grab my attention sufficiently, although the story was somewhat  interesting.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is a pretty fun game you can have lots of powers and helpers but there is only a few things wrong like sometimes when you jump or duck your player still keeps running and then you die and its a little blurry that's all that is an issue for me every thing else is fine
B004VOBIE8|1.0|Maybe it's me, but I couldn't figure out how to move or DELETE files.<br />I could find 'em....just couldn't delete 'em
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|What can you say new about Google! It's my favorite search engine and I'm so happy I can get it on my Kindle. It works just like the grown-up version.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is very well written.  It ends tragically so have tissues ready, but it was awesome!  It's well worth the read.
B00DYVUBYM|4.0|Entertaining movie, and fairly intriguing story, as it was based on true events. I was relatively unimpressed with the graphics/lighting/overall feel to the movie, but in the bonus features, the director explains why the movie is set to look the way it does. I watched it again with that in mind, and it definitely added to the story. I would recommend this movie. It's very interesting to see how society views celebrity status in today's world.
B001CZJKS0|3.0|In the description it said it was a six disc set and so I naturally assumed it was the complete Halloween 1-6. The box only contained actual movies 1, 4 & 5, the other disc were special edition like extended cuts and behind the scenes. Which was ok but I wanted the complete set, especially for that price. I had even scheduled a movie marathon party and had to scramble last minute to find the missing movies. They should really re-write the description of the product to more better reflect the actual contents.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Such a great film--I have read the book as well, and it stays pretty true to it. The cast is phenomenal, and the story is entertaining, as well as intriguing. Highly recommend this film.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Great band! Can't wait for their next album ... Every song is really good, enjoyed it a lot and I don't typically buy CD's
B0049P1VHS|5.0|excellent t.v. show.  i got this for my brother so he could start at the begining and now he is hooked.  Sundays are dead to us
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Very good and touching movie, you will never expect the almost end. This man shows people a new way of having hope alive for long long time .
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Very well made movie, I even watched it twice!!! I might even purchase it, it does have a little bit of everything!
B00ETHPJ1U|5.0|Oh damn, the whole thing for much, much less than I have paid all these years collecting - and there are just three more sets and I will have them all individually...  When it comes to Bach cantatas, of which I have loads, this set is by far my favorite.  Where others make Bach sound like a chugging misfiring Rube Goldberg (Reiner in his RCA), here there is spring, joy and grace.  Based primarily on these recordings, Gramophone magazine gave the Monteverdi Choir its #1 choir in the world ranking.  They have sung so much together, and John Eliott Gardiner is so in love with the music, I think the distinction is quite deserved.  I was lucky to hear them live in San Francisco some years ago and they were clean, sleek, warm, human.  Yes, there are a few of the cantatas that I know of other performances here and there move me more, but this is absolute pride of place on my shelves.  I adore them all.  I listen to them perhaps more than any other recordings I own.
0142405809|5.0|Love this book & love all of Julia Donaldson's books that we have read so far (Stick Man, Room on the Broom, Gruffalo, etc)!  Beautiful illustrations by Axel Scheffler and wonderful story - one of my son's favorites over the years.  Before my son could sit through reading all the text, he really enjoyed looking at all the illustrations and talking about what he saw.  This is on our list as one of our top books to give as a gift to toddlers from age 2+
0670024856|5.0|I had read Gilbert before, but this time she hit it on the perfection nose! An intelligent work of epic proportions.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Well written story with an interesting plot.Hated coming to the end of it. I think most women can relate to the characters and the situation - although this particular situation was out of the ordinary.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book was contrived, and I predicted the outcome immediately.  New York Times? I think their reviewers have lost a step.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I would give this book 6 stars if I could!! The ending was so amazing that I just sat there, on the couch, completely stunned. It took me about an hour to really process what had happened. And then I read the epilogue!!! (Do not hesitate or pause before reading it, like I did. Another twist!!) Stop reading the reviews and start this book!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Second time better! Hope EL James does write a fourth book. Want to know more about the wedding and from Mr. GREYS point of view!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is an amazing book! can't wait to read again and see the movie! definitely a must read for everyone
B004T81U4O|1.0|I only now just started watching Pretty Little Liars.While they are currently on something like season 4 I believe, I had trouble getting halfway through season one. What a ridiculous show. I started watching when nothing else was on. Even that isn't reason enough to continue. My complaints with the ridiculousness and inconsistency in this show are to many to list. The stupid decisions these girls make border on insulting to the intelligence of the audience. No matter what the target viewer is. The romanticized relationship between an English teacher (whom would be at the very least 24) and his 16 year old student is just irresponsible.  I can't image any parents thinking this show is ok viewing for their young teens or any adult finding this entertaining.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator I have ever used. Easy and convenient. 5 stars from me.<br />I would recommend every one put this on their device.<br />L. Beckman
B0087ITBT8|5.0|This is definitely a Barbra movie, she stole the movie, but without being too huge, she underplayed her role so well, you couldn't help love her!
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|LOTS OF EMOTIONS, VERY WELL ACTED, THE STORY IS GREAT.<br />SUPERMAN BECOMES A HUMAN BEING!!<br />ITS A FILM WITH A VERY DEEP MEANING.<br />I LOVE IT!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I always love<br /><br />grisham's books - this is one<br /><br />i'm reading twice -a rarity for me. Captivating with a twist.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|NOT WHAT I HAVE EXPECTED FROM HIS RECORDINGS.<br />I GOT THE FEELING THAT HE WAS ALREADY BORED FROM WHAT HE WAS DOING IN THIS CD AND DID' CARE NO MORE.<br />THAT IS THE FEELING I GOT WHEN I LISTENED TO IT.<br />YOU MIGHT SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT...BUT YOU ARE WRONG.<br />I STILL HAVE AND OWN HIS  FIRST THREE ORIGINAL VINYL ALBUMS. I AM IN PARADISE WHENEVER I LISTEN TO THEM<br />AND I SAW HIM (AND HEARD HIM) PLAYING 'LIVE' WITH HIS ORIGINAL GROUP ELEVEN TIMES IN WASHINGTON D.C. BACK IN THE 60'S.<br />AND I ALSO MET HIM PERSONALLY. WE DIDN'T SPOKE MUCH BUT HE KNEW ME A BIT.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved this book just as much as his others. Love the characters and the way they all tie together. I was happy to read more about ford county.
B00D014E4Y|2.0|Way too violent for my  5yr old.. Needs humor like Star Wars lego series. Only problem with Star Wars lego was that it was way to short.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Do I even need to rate this??? One of the best series ever (besides Harry Potter). I have read it over 5 times.
B00FHSQKZ4|1.0|Looked great, but haven't been able to do anything with it. Can't settings, it would be a great<br />tool if I could figure out how to use it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|A classic that everyone should own.  Story great for boys or girls keep the dream alive.  Need to have to rewatch this greatness
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I haven't read Stephen King in several years, but I really loved this book.  I had read The Shining when it first came out and loved it, as well as the movie.  So reading about the adult &#34;Danny&#34; was very rewarding.  All the characters had such depth to them and I loved the witty dialog.  I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Welcome back to my life Stephen King!  I have some reading to do!
B00FMF3R0I|5.0|This review is for the collection, which includes both versions of the Live At The BBC discs including volume 2.  The collection is a great addition to any Beatles collection.  I have the original Live At The BBC and now can attest that this remastered version is much better that the original.  And while Volume 2 does not disappoint, I am of the opinion that the original is stronger.  Perhaps it's just that they're running out of BBC takes from which to release.  Having said that, Volume 2 is worth it.  Overall, this is an excellent couple of discs and is up to to the quality of Beatles releases.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I love all of her songs. All songs and her voice impressed me. Great shipping & affordable price. I am happy to get it.
B00DZJ82W6|5.0|This was always one of my favorite Van albums, and this compilation is also one of my favorites.  The remastering of the original album is superb, and the blu-ray version is even better.  The outtakes disc are a little repetitious but worth it, if you love your Van.  While I don't buy many of these high priced box sets, I totally recommend this one.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This one is nice to check on how your wi-fi is working. I check every once in a while to make sure my wi-fi is running at it's top speed. Got it for free so I picked it up. Works great!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great Grisham read. As usual, I got totally caught up in his story telling and couldn't put this book down. Although I'm always frustrated by his anxiety inducing twists and his &#34;make you wait&#34; style of writing, I love it. This book is no exception. Even if you're not a die hard fan of Grisham, if you enjoy this type of book, you will love this.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This nice app boosts you memory by cleaning all your files and cleans your junk files to make your device's ram rum great. I use it once a day to keep everything running at top speed. Love it and would recommend it to everyone!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazingly quick read with twist an  turns that leave you wanting more. Getting ready for Catching Fire movie and reread
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is my favorite in the series is so action packed and exciting make sure to buy mocking Jay at the same time so you can go right into it!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am addicted to this game. It's so much fun and very easy to use. I love the challenge to beat it!
031606792X|5.0|Bought for my daughters and they both loved it.  Fast shipping and a great price. If you are reading the series you can not go wrong.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|This was an entertaining, not too heavy movie. I wouldn't put it at the top of my list, but it was good enough to spend a couple hours on a rainy day watching it.  I liked it!
B00004U8P9|5.0|What can I say.  The cast of course were superb!  Great value and a must have if you even vaguely like the Rocky Horror show!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I miss tris! The whole book was good, but he end was just heart wrenching. It was a good ending, but I wish she didn't die.
0525478817|4.0|Gives an interesting perspective on teenage cancer patients. Sad and funny at the same time in some parts. I preferred this one to Looking for Alaska.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Five stars again. If you love this guy's work, then what is not to like here?<br /><br />Plus, by purchasing through my Prime account I got free delivery on a new set of discs, with no shipping, and within minutes after ordering I was listening to my purchase on my Kindle with the auto-rip copy.<br /><br />I can only hope to experience Richard playing/singing much of this music electrically live (or acoustically, if Richard so decides). That would make this even better.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The prices fit so perfectly...it could not be a better book. Anxiously I will devour Mockinjgjay to find out who will be the ultimate victor!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is the best book ever!!! I could not put this book down. My 13 year old has read it as well and she fell in love with Mitch Albom. we are reading his other books as well
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not a great example for young women today.  Might as well name her Barbie.  Barbie's figure is as absurd as Ana's sexual experiences!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you like romance and a great ending. This is the book for you. I am hooked on Nicholas Sparks books now.
B005MXQD5Q|5.0|No other Cohen collection of music is so moving.  Even visually, it made me want to sketch the faces of each of the players, or scene tidbits, combos--everything that contributes to this great CD, not only the words, original accompaniment, and performances.  Impressively artistic.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Love this writers writing style!  So glad a friend introduced me to Kate Morton!  I was surprised by the ending.  Thought I had it all figured out!  LOL
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I don't see what all the hate is about. How can you b*tch when 12/15 songs are absolutely phenomenal.<br /><br />IMO, this is her best album yet.  It might have &#34;as catchy&#34; singles that forever remain stuck in our head for 5 years like Paparazzi, but as a holistic effort, it is her most bold, daring move to date.  And it's truly and album that truly tells a story when listened from start to finish.  Just give it two or three complete listens through before you make your judgement.<br /><br />All props and love for Gaga. I am so happy she is finally honoring who she really is as a person and not just some creation of the corporate music machine.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|While I enjoy all Grisham books, this one was just okay. When I heard that it had the same characters as a Time to Kill (my favorite Grisham novel), I had high hopes. I found this one was easy to put down and I wasn't necessarily excited to pick it back up. It was also a bit predictable so the climax of the book wasn't as exciting. I think it's still worth a read, though.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|If this had been the first book in the series, I definitely would not have read the whole series. It was not a terrible book but it was far from mesmerizing. Having two narrators did not work at all. They sounded exactly the same and I had to keep going back to the beginning of the chapter to see who the narrator was. The action was very repetitive. I did not find the ending as disappointing as some of the other reviewers but, for the most part, there was little suspense in the book. Four became less interesting as the book wore on. I believe that there are one or two good movies that will come from the series, but certainly not three... or &#34;four!&#34;
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I have tried so many weather apps on my kindle fire. I had nor found one I liked. I even paid for one thinking it would be what I was looking for. It was so complicated I took off Kindle. Then I seen this one I down loaded app. EXACTLEY what I was looking for.
159315724X|5.0|An excellent book with some incredibly simple life changing ideas.  Well written by the editor of Success magazine.  Easy to read.  Simple stories that make sense and fit easily into your daily life.  Well worth picking up a copy. Giving as a gift to graduates, newly weds, and anyone who needs to jumpstart their income, their lives, and their success.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an organizational psychologist (and an introvert) I am very well versed on this subject.  What this author does is not so much explain just want being introverted means but since she is a lawyer she makes a case for how introverts have to struggle in an extroverted (American) culture.  It was hilarious to read her slice and dice Anthony Roberts exposing him (albeit sideways) for being just a booming outlandish fraud.  She sort of cuts extroverts down but hey, its  probably time.  The technology revolution is making way for introverts both in appreciating their innovation and contribution to its development as well as carving out places for them to thrive as workers.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen. The Academy should be ashamed of themselves for giving the Oscar to Argo instead of this wonderful film! You may think you won't like it, but I don't see how anybody could NOT love it!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I cannot even begin to tell anyone how awesome this book is. The flow is amazing and the whole book keeps you on the edge of your seat! I seriously laughed and cried with the characters as if I was standing right there with them. Jennifer has an amazing way of pulling you into her world and bringing everything to life right before your eyes. I am truly sad to come to the end of this series as it was one of the best I have ever read. Can't wait for the final luxen book to come out next year! Amazing work from an amazing author!
1937053571|5.0|It's over. It almost feels like I'm dreaming. It's that surreal and bittersweet. Unlike the other books in the series, I savored Sentinel. I made sure I didn't read it all in one go because I didn't want the story to be over and I didn't want to let go of Alex and Aiden just yet.<br /><br />Certain things that happened in the book were surprising, especially in the final chapters (I was crying, of course). But those moments led to an ending that was totally unexpected, yet utterly and completely satisfying. Sentinel is the type of conclusion I always hope for with series I read. It answered all my questions and didn't leave me feeling devastated. Even though I'm still going to miss Alex and Aiden so much, I'm happy with the conclusion they got. It was one that they both earned and deserved, and I get choked up just thinking about it. Seriously, I want to hug the author for writing an ending that left me content and smiling with tears in my eyes.<br /><br />The Covenant series will always be one of my favorite series ever. I will never forget how addicting, funny, badass, and hot the entire series was. And I will never forget that it was the series that introduced me to the amazing story-telling of Jennifer L. Armentrout.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|As I've said before, this series is fantastic! I could never completely guess the next move, the next disaster, the next great accomplishment. The series is satisfying and thought provoking. I felt such a range of emotions for our main character: from frustration and even anger, to pride and awe. My heart pounded, I shed tears, I laughed, and I squirmed. I can't say enough positive things about this series. I bought this series on my kindle, and I'll be buying it to place on my book shelf.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A great movie for a cold night.  Wife was not too put off by the lack of depth in the plot!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you are a hater looking for a complex book about science, or just something new to criticize, don't waste your time and save your money.<br /><br />If you are a dreamer looking for something light and fun to read about being positive and achieving things, you'll find a great joy in following this really simple experiments.<br /><br />This is a book that doesn't require too much thinking or too much effort from yourself, and that will have you entertained looking for fun and random stuff for the next couple of weeks. Best thing is, fun and random stuff DOES happen.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|My brother in law was so happy that i bought this movie because it is his favorite christmas movie. it came in good time. it wasn't cracked or scratched and it plays really good.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This was the best novel I've read in years and may join my list of very favorite novels of all time. Enough said.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|My mom was sooooo happy when i showed her that i bought this movie. i wish i could have gotten it at walmart for a cheaper price however. Any way, the DVD came in good time, it wasn't cracked or scratched and it plays very well.
0061231401|5.0|I love Rollins's books.  He puts the science back into science fiction and this book certainly lives up to expectations.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game.  It's got great graphics and best of all it was free.  Can't beat the deal on this game.
1603420398|5.0|excellent for advanced crochet people, great diagrams and directions. when I 1st looked at this book my imagination went wild
B001BANK32|5.0|Great book!  Draws you in from the very beginning and keeps you in suspense until the very end.  If you only saw the movie, I highly recommend reading the book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Those are the words of Anastasia Steele and they perfectly sum up  what I was thinking the whole time. I didn't think I would like this book. I thought it was gonna be a cheap gimmick after all the hype, but I was mesmerized as soon as I got into it. I could not put it down and finished in 2 days. I highly recommend this book.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|This is a must-read book. Very motivating and amazingly drafted.<br />Each word will take you deep into that mission.<br />Mark Owen- You did a great job!<br />Worth buying. Happy to have this. Thanks a lot to the publisher and Amazon Store for making it available on Kindle Store.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|The games are very fun, and there's good variety so you can use the app for quite awhile before getting bored of it. The app is also really easy to use, and it looks nice as well.<br /><br />The factor that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that I'm not sure that the games are challenging enough to be &quot;brain training&quot;. Some of them are just a little bit too simple for that, and with some of them, particularly the ones involving arithmetic, you could make a lot of progress simply because you have memorized the relevant mathematical statements (ex: 8+5=13) and not because you have actually increased the speed with which you are able to process information.  I guess it all depends on which cognitive skills you want to develop.
B00ECJ18HO|4.0|There are many original illustrations interspersed throughout the story that help the reader not only appreciate the action but also via the clothing styles travel back to Doyle's time.  The characters' utterances seem less stilted and more fitting, when you can see how they're dressed.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Love this new record! I'm a rat pack junkie and I put Michael Buble right in with the gang, but with this album he's crossed over into Mowtown! The songs are really bright and fresh but with that classic throwback vibe. You got the feel of Sam Cooke / Ben E King, Dean Martin / Frank Sinatra, and Michaels own personal style running through this entire album, and the layout works well with each song flowing into the next. I also love that he's added more of his own material -which is really good! I usually dislike albums that have featured artists singing together, but it works here, especially the song with Reese Witherspoon which I was totally surprised about. For me this is his best album so far. He's up'd his game adding Mowtown, which was a great move because its hard to stay current with the songs he does. If you like Buble and are open to growth you should really like this one, but even if you don't care for his style, take a good listen to the album sample on Amazon or iTunes (which give you a longer run time of each sample) to get the feel for this album before you pass. Im telling you, its very different than any of his others, and may just snag you as a new fan if you're into Mowtown.
B001NHNG64|4.0|A good easy read. Stayed true to the Jack Reacher story line. Easy story line although the dialogue is a bit too stilted.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Awesome game!  Recommended to family and friends to play.  Playing this game can become very addictive and yet very challenging, especially the format.  Multiple columns at one time.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|I will probably read everything Abercrombie writes.  He expounds on a lot of detailed violence I skim over, but he has great character development and plots.  Lots of surprises
B00FN811SY|5.0|Blessing.  I use it now in the ministry to assist others as to all the hard work our faithful Brothers have put into it and Jehovah God for using them.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Retribution co-mingled with healing-- who could ask for. A more moral ending of the horrid amoral history of our growing pains in this country.  An easy read, yet hard to swallow.  Altogether, a beautiful full circle story worth every minute of the revaluation.
B00C1040TO|5.0|Originally gave this a lower review because it wasn't working (no sound) on my 1st gen Kindle. Immediately received polite and concerned responses from the developer inquiring about my device and explaining the app does not function on the 1st gen due to lack of microphone on the device.  Although I can't use the app, that level of customer support along with the great UI and supporting documentation merits 5 stars. Thanks and best of luck to the devs :).
B004DLPXAO|1.0|My android phone went into safe mode and I lost all my archived books except for the Bible which i had bookmarked and highlighted.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a very useful app for my Kindle Fire.  All features - delete junk files, task killer, uninstall, app sorting - work great and I use it every day to clean up files and free up device memory. Keeps my Kindle Fire running smoothly and I would recommend it as quick, easy to use and reliable.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I just love it enjoy this type of game keeps me best and like the many<br />styles of puzzles and hidden mystery it offers.
B00EZPCZ5O|2.0|Here's the issue. AFI were one of my favorite bands ever. Around the time of the All Hallows e.p. they could do absolutely no wrong. Everything they tried was new and exciting. Every element they folded into the mix made their original sound that much stronger and full sounding. From the time of Sing the Sorrow on they started dabbling in electronica, post rock and new wave and in the correct amounts these elements work to AFI's benefit as on songs like Dancing Through Sunday and Death of Seasons. Then, they lost their freaking minds. A band that was so progressive and prolific just started looking backward, only backward, and insisting they are moving forward. Hey fellas, Nine Inch Nails was popular 20 years ago. Joy Division was popular 20 years ago. New Wave is punks dweeby younger brother and punk is still alive and thriving, but new wave had been murdered by indie rock years ago! Electronica had been overtaken by Dub and house music years ago as well. So here it is, the new AFI record, sounding fresh out of 1996, and this time instead of touring with Bad Religion or the Vandals, they should be touring with Korn, Type-o-Negative and Deftones. Fans of the band love to say, \\"the band has changed, you have to change with it.\\" I agree if the band wants to look forward and do something different and new. This isn't different, it's definitely not new, it's well done and is better than most other bands out there, but it's not indicative of AFI's better work. All I can think about when hearing new AFI is Davey saying, \\"Things I said I'd never do, I've done. Things I said I'd never be, I've become.\\" Indeed.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It you like puzzels this is the game for you to check out Lots of fun<br />and good for the mind.
1250012570|5.0|I loved this book! I thought the characters were wonderful. I loved the back and forth handoff between Eleanor and Park. I loved how you get to see the story from both points of view. This had sortof a &#34;Pretty In Pink&#34; feel to me. I hated Eleanor's family, but I loved how she fought to be herself, in spite of them. This book took me back to memories of that sweet &#34;first love&#34; feeling. So cute!
B0063IH60K|5.0|always a game that relax my mind while playing cards good eye contact too i just love it and look for to winning alot
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great read! Can't find another book even close. I would recommend it as a great romance. I would have never read a romance book until now.
B0054N73EY|4.0|Its the Red Hot Chili Peppers, enough said. Great CD, great band. If you like their other recent albumns you will like this one.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Like this version better than the other and LOVE that I can now play on my Kindle Fire.<br />Definitely recommend!!!
B001SGEUNI|4.0|Bought this for the significant other, he loves the one song, and the rest of the album isn't bad either.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great - easy to set up and can have multiple alarms going at the same time.  I also love that it overrides the volume button, so it doesn't matter if I've turned off the sound, the alarm goes off anyway (just make sure you don't leave headphones plugged in!)
B005NF2UE6|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my mom, she's still a big Nickelback fan and it made her happy so I'm happy!
B000FC0SIM|4.0|Great to get into the mind of one of the greats as view his perspective on writing. The 4/5 rating is Kings's fault for setting the standard so high through his other works.
B00GQ8MZDU|5.0|RIPPING OFF PEOPLE<br />I bought Season 8 episode 1 for 1.99 then it came up to buy for 19.99 for season 8 and I bought it and when I went to play it it came up I needed to pay again now the last 3 episodes it is asking me to buy again.  This guy or Amazon is ripping people off.  So do I go on FB and Google and Twitter with well over 2,000 friends, 1,500 twitter and tons on google friends who know friends and make sure nobody buys from Amazon or this person AGAIN.!!!!!!!!!  I want my money back that kept going in your pocket.  So, first thing I will do is go to paypal and get back what is mine and how much was watched.  OH yes, Netflix will have complete Season January Thank you
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala is a very brilliant and intelligent young woman full of wisdom and has a lot to offer her country as a Prime Minister<br /><br />if she becomes one in the future. The book is highly informative giving a clear insight of some of the happenings in her country.<br /><br />It is sad and worrying that these things happens to innocent human beings. I have not reached the part where she got shot but<br /><br />thank God she survived. I wish her all the best in her future in what ever road she embarks on.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|GAGA'S BEST WORK YET! Lady Gaga has truly crashed the critics in this new album release. ARTPOP has debuted at #1 in America. Congrats Gaga, I can't wait for ARTPOP ACT II!
B0090SI460|4.0|Original good plot, Amazing 3D picture and colors, bright clear picture, lots of fun, good for all the family any time.
0316322407|5.0|Far beyond my expectations!  It's simply beautiful how a fourteen year old<br />can have such a concerted movement for such a special cause....<br />accolades all the way.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I like playing pool it's one of my favorite past times, to know i can play other people live is even more exciting. Why i didn't find this game sooner i'll never know.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|The story of the struggle between Kal-El (Superman) and General Zod was already done in a previous Superman movie. The depiction of planet Krypton as an advanced society was not as convincing as in previous Superman movies. Cool special effects, though, in the fight scenes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's one of my favorite games on my kindle. It has times where it glitches but other than when the occurs this game is so fun and addictive.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really enjoy this game keeps me occupied on boring games expands my patience. I really love it teaching my daughter.Excellent game to past time
B006FPFTMS|5.0|Excellent App<br />Way better than Adobe Reader or others and it includes many many features. I give it my highest recommendation.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Never in my life, have I been more addicted to a book. I am very excited to read each of the remaining 16 books in this series. Although, I don't get much else done anymore! Now I need a housekeeper and someone to go to the gym for me! 😍
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I am a huge ABBA fan and love this movie.  Wanted to get the album for a while and finally bought it.  Some of the singing is a little off key of ABBA because it is the actors, but it takes you back to the movie when you hear their voices.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Fun like I only remember having as a little kid.<br />Giant robots fighting giant monsters without some kind of 'extra' message like 'man is the real monster' or 'don't destroy nature' is rather refreshing in it's simplicity. Even the characters act like they know they're in a giant robot movie, yet at the same time manage to break some expected tropes.<br />All in all a great movie, that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen and best sound system you can find.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Lorde is an awesome singer!  She is very talented and has a great voice.  The songs are very catchy and have meaning.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has honored us with ,<br />Mystery and tails about the South using his skills to entertain a lot of Great reads.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|I had forgotten about Arcade Fire for a couple years until I saw them on Saturday Night Live.  Heard a few songs from this album and was hooked on them all over again!  Pre-ordered this album and it does not disappoint!  They are so creative and have a great sound.
B00GINENG0|5.0|U should buy this app it is all much fun<br />I play it all the time it's a really fun game I'd get get get get get it u should get it get it get it get it get it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I didn't imagine I could care for such characters as these. Hazel shows you that you don't need to be heroic. and Augustus shows you that no matter what's wrong, you fight for what's right. in the beginning, I thought that she wouldn't let him in. In the middle of it, I was truly in love with Augustus waters myself. and by the end, I was balling my eyes out. I read this book until 5am. with school the next day. all that I can say is that this could not have been better written. And my life if better everyday because I have read it. I feel like now I can turkey appreciate life. Thank you John Green.
0689835604|5.0|My son loves this book, It is his favorite so I just bought more like it.  He wants me to read it to him over and over.  He likes to help me look under the flaps
B00FPH3YQA|5.0|My family and I couldn't stop laughing our butts off to this flick. I definitely recommend this if you need a laugh.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Google is putting the brakes on third party mobile app development. Also one cannot cast from the mobile chrome app.<br /><br />Phone support is lackluster but otherwise would have been 5 stars.
1476733953|3.0|Good story, but very slow to develop.  It would have been nice to have a bit more background on how they got where they are, but I feel that was intentionally left out.

B00ENTDDGW|4.0|Looks great....It is a fun game. I have a Note 2 so it is big enough to play with two people.
B00CEZJT2E|2.0|Seems to work well enough but the built in plug needs to be redesigned slimmer. Will not plug into phone with any type of phone case installed. Forces you to carry a usb cable anyway.
0307010856|5.0|25 years later and its still one of my favorite childhood books. I bout it again for my 2 little ones and they also love it.
B00070QXL8|5.0|Thank you for a wonderful experience. I normally do not like ordering product on line because it can become a hassle. This experience was really good I will recommend the product to family and friends and I will use your services again. Thank you!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is an amazing author and the fan base he has made for himself among young adult readers is huge. Especially due to this youtube channels. I picked this book up after my fourteen year old son read it for the third time and kept insisting I read it. He and all his friends are huge John Green fans. I pick up the book and I read it from front to back. It is amazing and very enduring to the human spirit. The look he takes at cancer kids as he calls them and allows us to look inside their lives and struggles is very real even though this is a fictional story. He does not sugar coat what the characters are experiencing. I feel if anything reading this book will help people of all ages understand more what it is like for people struggling with any terminal illness and understand what their friends or family are enduring at that time. Just have tissues ready and lots of them because the tears will roll.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|great app, easy to use, works for all my needs, easy email settingfun to use with full features bye bye
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really don't like the fact that I can't use any of the extra moves that are given to me by friends. My mobile version has lots of free moves that I can't access. Fix that and this game would get two more stars from me. :)
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I I I I I I I I. Free  I I.  Free download the world on fire and work with a difference between two and work read the rest is halo
B00EHAIHWM|3.0|I like the first three songs in this album - they have the same catchy beat as previous songs. However, the rest just feel forced, as if the band didn't like the song, but couldn't think of a better one.
B009SSCG9I|4.0|Enough has been said about James Blake's brilliance over the past couple of years and this further confirms it. 12 tracks of sublime, soulful post-dub. The standout tracks for me are &#34;Limit to Your Love&#34;, &#34;A Case of You&#34; and &#34;Falls Creek Boys Choir&#34;, all on Side D (or Side B of the 2nd LP).<br />However, my only gripe is that with a total of just 12 tracks, each side featuring 3 tracks, one wonders if this could be produced as a LP instead of a double LP. Especially so, considering that a couple of the tracks here are available on his self-titled album.<br />Having said that, this album is a great compilation to have, but don't expect anything new here.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I fail to understand how anyone can dislike ARTPOP. It is a shame that there are so many tasteless people out there.
0765324849|2.0|This book is poorly written and ham-fisted. I bought it thinking it would broaden my enjoyment of the Bioshock universe, but it just turned me off. Enjoy the video games, skip the book.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Very intensive TV series. Interesting actors, great acting. Fast-paced (and fast talking too). Highly recommended! One of the best I have seen recently.
020530902X|4.0|Not enough writers have read and studied this book. If you have aspirations to be a great writer, or even a good writer, add this to your cart now.
B00F8OV4HQ|4.0|Actually have not heard this yet and I know the great music is what counts but this box set doesn't get a well-designed, photo-crammed booklet?  Somebody was awfully cheap and I think it's disrespectful
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|The animation is improved and the plot pace gets a shot of adrenaline. If you are new to the series, this is not a good place to start. The pacing on the show actually gives you time to understand WTF is going on, whereas this version is like, &#34;Confused? Too bad. MORE WEIRDNESS!!!&#34;
B00ALQSNV6|5.0|Oddly enough, after watching all 6 episodes back to back and enjoying the very real animation as well as the great info and narration, I went to bed and had the wildest nightmares / dreams. All involved current peoples, places etc. but terrorized by dinosaurs. I can only attribute it to my ever enthusiastic feelings about the subject but especially to the terrific animation. I was right next to them watching the series, and they were right next to me after I was done for the night. It was a bit of a &#34;double feature&#34; if you will!<br />Bob
0380973650|5.0|I love this sprawling narrative and I have given this book to several people. This is easily my favorite book.
B001EC0OPO|5.0|I just love goofy, off the wall, tongue in cheek Sci-fi as much as a more serious, intense and cerebral take - they both have their places and purposes. Some make you scared and cause you to think, and some make you think but give you a good laugh at the same time.<br />Bob
6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude is an awesome film, but this DVD is not worth it. The Criterion Collection version is out, and it would probably be worth your money more than this.
0345803507|5.0|Very enjoyable book, especially on a long flight.  Kept me glued the whole time I was reading it...I didn't want to stop.
B00008DDXC|4.0|The special features on all the Harry Potter films are worth owning. If you like the movies and want to see how they were made, shell out for the physical copy.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I knew of the history of the Orphan Trains, but put in this narrative format gave it new, deeper meaning.
B000AP04L0|4.0|Mike Judge's only good movie that defined a comedy for a short time. It introduced some of us to Ron Livingston and immortalized the the phrase &#34;That would be greaaaaaaaat&#34;.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|So I picked this up not knowing what to expect. Being a sort of budget audiophile, I picked up a pair of Mogul headphones for my Galaxy S4. And I love those headphones. For $50, they're about as good as any Beats headphones I've ever tried. Well as I read further into what it means to be an audiophile, I learned that I need high fidelity formats so I deleted my music library and ripped my CDs in lossless formats. Further on, I found that one also needs a headphone amp.<br /><br />Still being new to this, I didn't want to invest hundreds into my setup just in case it wasn't for me. So I ran into this. It had some pretty awesome reviews. Still being kind of skeptical, I went ahead and picked one up anyway. I didn't know what to expect.<br /><br />So when my package came in the mail today, I opened it up. To say this amp is tiny is a serious understatement. Sure I read the dimensions, but I didn't have a ruler on hand so seeing it was the best measurement for me. I pulled it out and it's like it's a plastic case full of helium. There isn't much mass at all in sixteen grams.<br /><br />So being so cheap and light, I immediately lost heart in this little guy. I started to think it was just a little over hyped. But I gave it a shot anyway because what the heck...<br /><br />I charged this little guy up, plugged everything in, put on a bass heavy track, and gave it some volume.<br /><br />My God.<br /><br />I started half-laughing/half-crying. It was pretty much the most beautifully reproduced sound I've ever heard in my life. I mean, if I closed my eyes, I could have imagined myself hearing this in concert. This little amplifier is absolutely bonkers!<br /><br />I believe that any pair of high quality headphones (especially something bearing the name Bose, Beats, or Audio-Technica) will benefit from this amp. If you're just getting into being an audiophile, this thing is perfect for the price.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|If you do not suffer from zombie burnout, get ready. While I think the show is well-made, it was instrumental in me getting really tired of zombies. Admittedly, this occurred in the second season of TWD, but that is the direction you will be heading after starting here.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Rose had been emotionally an verbally abused the twenty four years of her life and she saw visions. Usually her visions were small mundane things but one day she saw her own death. What happens next is an exciting story filled with the sadness and the joyful liberation of Rose. You have murder, action and suspense with enough twists and emotional upheaval to keep you turning pages to see what happens next. This book was much more then I expected and I can't wait to see what else this author has written.
B002Q9VPFM|3.0|This is a great edition of the film, as it has EVERYTHING when it comes to this project. You get the cinematic comic, you get Curse of the Black Freighter, you get every special feature, and you get the film. What you do not get is an option to watch the original theatrical version of the film, which means scratching that &#34;I Feel Like Watching 'Watchmen'&#34; itch will take four friggin' hours. If you like the movie, grab the standard Blu-ray. If you LOVE the movie, grab the special edition. If you ARE CRAZY about the movie, get this version.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Then you get to the fourth and it slows way down...I still finished and loved it though!  It would be nice if book 6 we're coming out anytime soon.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Just a stunning series about nature and our planet. Perfect for relaxing after a long day at work. You could even mute the television and throw on some music and it would be pretty cool.
B00FHB7398|3.0|This game would be five stars if it were not for the problems with the touch screen version.  Some items in ho scenes are just plain unresponsive to tapping.  Using the zoom feature does not help.  Especially in instances of items that need to be combined in an ho scene, this is not only annoying but could prevent progress if the hint and skip function are not available.  This game doesn't seem to have been adapted very well for tablet play.  The final game during bonus play was literally unresponsive on my kindle fire touch screen and I had to skip it.  Not a huge deal, but a good example of the worst case scenario, depending on the device you are using.<br /><br />Aside from that, this game is really great.  The story and game play are fun, not too many or too few ho scenes.  This game was exactly suited to my tastes as far as the pacing, artwork, scenes, etc.  It truly does make me sad that I have to give it three stars.  Without glitches this is truly a five star game.<br /><br />If you don't mind playing in the casual or middle levels, I recommend this game highly.  If you are buying a tablet version and want to play advanced mode, you may be frustrated and/or disappointed.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|A shift in tone, pace and camera quality makes for a great cap to the Firefly series. Pick it up to see how it ends.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The quality of the picture and video loading speed is great!<br />It is very easy to control from my iphone or ipad.<br />Now I can watch more youtube videos from my big screen TV.<br /><br />Recommend it!
B001M5UDGS|3.0|I like Dr. Horrible, but I wouldn't say it is worth owning. Although, owning the DVD is the only way to get the audio commentary and the MUSICAL audio commentary. If you just can't get enough Dr. Horrible or Joss Whedon, buy this.
B009ME47H2|5.0|It is very easy to use and fits my busy lifestyle. Make audio notes and listen or edit at your convenience.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly hasn't aged very well, but the things that made you love it are still there. The writing is witty and the characters are still cool. Glad it ended in its prime.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|THE MOST AMAZING SERIE I HAVE EVER SEEN<br /><br />I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS SERIE TO EVERYBODY, IT IS SO UNEXPECTED THAT YOU CANNOT GET YOUR ATTENTION OUT OF IT
B000VBJEEG|4.0|This is the forgotten Pixar film that is a stunning allegory for the Disney/Pixar acquisition. Outside of that, the story is touching and the animation is - obviously - incredible.
0761172726|5.0|We have been using this calendar for years to keep track of where everyone is supposed to be - Mom Loves it, so I love it!
B0000E6XH3|3.0|This is a pretty cool DVD to throw on at parties, but makes for a boring evening of movie watching.
0393061310|5.0|I have been looking to add this book to my library - again - ever since I loaned it to a co-worker and never saw it again! A fascinating and easy to read discussion on why the world looks like it does in terms of geopolitics. If you have any interest at all in history and why societies flourished then floundered in favor of other societies, this book is a must read!
B000BCKFWK|4.0|Definitely didn't need a mini copy of A Dame to Kill For. Movie is awesome and the special features are cool. The creation of this film is a story in and of itself, and no streaming service is going to give you that. Go with the 2-disc edition and skip the collector's.
B00DXLO0D6|5.0|Wonderful to see this show with all its episodes complete and together.  It brought and still does bring joy to many...
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Way faster paced than the series, and therefore CRAZIER. The animation is better, with the exception of the CGI Eva Units. Can't wait for the third movie to come out.
0375413405|5.0|This cookbook brings back so many great memories of my Mom..I'm buying two of them for my daughters.  Thank you so much for offering this book at such a great price
0393327345|5.0|This book is a perfect companion for the film, as they both improve the experience of one another. If it weren't for the tone set by the film, this book would be really dark and sinister. Without this book, the film might give you the wrong message on who and what Tyler is. Watch, then read. Read, then watch. This rarely happens with film adaptation.
B0007LGCA4|5.0|They fit great (except for the fact that my husband has funny pinky toes, and they almost stick out at the sides.) They are great for the river! They are wonderful summer hiking shoes! And over all, I think they will last forever!
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|People took issue with this film, but I think it is because the original was so creative. Yes, the same story has been told better since, but Tron started it all. This film is cannon to that world, and therefore deserves a place on all Tron fans' shelves.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Whatever People Say I am, That's What I'm Not will always be my favorite but this is a close second. It really shows the maturity of the band, it sounds like The Arctic Monkeys but it doesn't sounds old and recycled like half the bands out there today. My album of the year.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The start of the series. Grab the Blu-rays when they are cheap, or end up shelling out some serious HBO bucks! It is as good as everyone says.
0142428280|4.0|I read a few other reviews on this book and seems like a lot of people who gave it a 1 star seem to have had political rather literary disagreements with the book. Biggest gripe being all aristocracy was wicked, all labor classes good, etc.<br /><br />However, aside for political disagreements people may have, Ken Follett brilliantly captures the struggle of the lower and middle classes, the struggle of women, and most importantly the reasons for their rise; a big part of the rise was because of their treatment by the aristocratic class. This is NOT a secret folks!!!<br /><br />The book beautifully parallels the rise of lower classes in Britain and Russia. Because the treatment of the lower classes by the aristocracy in Russia was a lot more ruthless than in Britain, Russia went from a full blown Monarchy to a Bolshevik (Communist) dictatorship very quickly, while in Britain the rise of the lower class was more gradual therefore more &#34;civil,&#34; and it never got as extreme as it did in Russia.<br /><br />The American part in the book is brilliantly laid out too because it shows that one of the great American Presidents (Wilson) uses his Presidential powers to the limits of the Constitution, maybe a little beyond. Something we think that only Presidents in recent decades have done, when in reality US Presidents have pushed the boundaries of the Constitution ever since the 2nd President of the US, John Adams in 1797.<br /><br />Though I loved the book, and think it should be a must read for all, I had to give it 4 stars:<br /><br />- The first half of the book was brilliantly laid out, scenarios plausible and characters well developed.<br /><br />- Second part of the book was well laid out, but Ken Follett seemed to be rushing through major events and forcing the characters to be a part to those events. Almost felt like reading an abridged version of a good book. The second part of the book should have been better thought out, at least the character placement, and 150% longer.<br /><br />A great read, that could have been outstanding.d 150% longer.<br /><br />A great read, that could have been outstanding.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The special features on all the Harry Potter films are worth owning. If you like the movies and want to see how they were made, shell out for the physical copy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Huge numbers make it easy to use. I love that it is truly free! No glitches as of yet & I use it at work all the time!
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Hugh Grant plays a great narcissist, and it works well when you team him up with a little kid. Worth a couple of laughs, and more than a few heartstring-tugging moments. I don't know how the special features fare.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|It is ABSOLUTELY phenomenal! I can't wait to see the 2nd season and get it on dvd. In fact, I love this series so much, I think I will also buy it on bluray. lol :)
1400049628|4.0|A tongue-in-cheek, yet still informative, take on most survival guides. You could probably credit this book with sparking the recent zombie craze. It is a great gift, but I think most people who have even the slightest of interest in zombies already own it. It's a fun read that will make you ask, over and over, &#34;What would I do?&#34;
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I did not suceed in downloading to Samsung P 1000. kids play alot with ver 1 and seem to enjoy it.  this has better graphics and may have been liked by them.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Great season! The best season of The Walking Dead that I have seen. I haven't seen the fourth season yet.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Best book ever and  is perfect to read during the holiday I love this book and you should buy this book
B004I654WQ|5.0|By far, my son's favorite movie along with Cars 2.  He's watched this multiple times so the purchase was well worth it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|OMG!!!!!! I LOVED THIS BOOK IT WAS SO GOOD I WISH TRIS DIDN'T DIE BUT I STILL LOVED IT I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE TO COME OUT.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Intense, but good. An interested look at cancer and love and life from the perspective of a teen girl. Funny and heartbreaking.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game to play. I loved it on Facebook and I think I like it even better on the kindle fire.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Then my kindle randomly shut itself off while it was open and somehow erased all my progress... Now I'm having to start over and I'm a little annoyed. I thought progress was supposed to be saved with your Facebook when you link them but apparently that's not true. It's still connected to Facebook, yet I'm back at the beginning..<br />(Edit: And somehow it all got brought back after a while. Lol Confusing..
143353083X|5.0|This bible is amazing. I originally wanted to get a niv version, but this study bible has by far met my expectations. It gives introductions to each section and book, and provides background information as you read, providing additional points that help explain certain verses and gives further interesting details that help you understand the settings, and the teachings. I recommend buying it!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|This book makes good scientific sense and provides a simple and achievable strategy to lose weight and improve general health. I have adopted the 5:2 strategy and love it!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Big fan of the comic and more fan of this movie,  Great effects ,cast and director. It's a must have.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is in fine form with this return to the small town lawyer and his new big problem. A wonderful story about family and history and finding a way to redeem the sins of the father, so to say. The characters are believable, likeable/unlikeable, and seem to be acting in a real way. Suspenseful and fun to read.
B00D6M86RS|3.0|To me the pinball machine semees very small and literally you're hitting the ball at random. I wound not recommended this game
B0091REZMW|4.0|Nice game. I like the variety.  Hard to see in night view. I do not like having to connect to facebook
0143118757|5.0|Everyone needs help in negotiating wisely! This book helps you get what you want in a tactful way so that no one feels they have taken advantage of in the situation.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I enjoy playing it, I enjoying playing all types of games. It keeps you thinking what to do me t. It is entertaining
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app may allow you to log in but soon enough you will see KIK MESSENGER HAS STOPPED what? I tried to create a new account nothing worked
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I already play a few Zynga games on my Mac, so when I bought my new Kindle I was happy to discover that I could download Castleville Legends - absolutely gorgeous graphics. Very happy :)
B00E9A656K|5.0|Awesome game.  The graphics are great, I'm addicted.  The only suggestion would be easier to fill the gas tank.  Great app.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Totally unique perspective on the causes of success. Gladwell uses anecdotes of some of the most successful people from the last two centuries to argue that success is more deterministic than our American culture assumes. It's powerful conclusions will make you question the viability of a true meritocracy and whether the outrageously rich and successful people of the world are geniuses or just lucky.
B004SKLFJS|5.0|I have always enjoyed this show. While Flately is the centerpiece, there are many other good performers. I especially like the ending where there was encore after encore.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Just a little annoying when you run out of light powers to play in each match. Honestly I like it.
B00C1040TO|5.0|I just tested this for accuracy alongside a strobe tuner and a Korg digital tuner. l tested 4-string bass, guitar and checked against a Yamaha keyboard. Spot on in all cases! Enough said! This is impressive!!<br /><br />The metronome also works as advertised and so does the recorder... and that is just gravy. :)
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|she is one of my favorite monster high dolls the dress is pink and sparkley and i like it. ps on the box you get cattys signature
B00FSCLM5C|5.0|OMG!  She did it again...<br /><br />This album is released as a GREATEST HITS but Laura Pausini takes it to a fully rewritten or remastered version.  While you may get the same songs; all arrangements, styles, singers are all introduced  as new or different versions.<br /><br />It's amazing and stunning beauty in audio presentation.<br /><br />I would have loved a DVD version including the making of the album because it represents two decades of magical music but that's just the greed in me.<br /><br />Thank you Laura for one of your best-ever releases and keeping it all new, while still in classic past for your decades of accomplishments.  You are a star indeed.<br /><br />For those ordering on Amazon; there are TWO (2) versions.  I suspected it was Spanish vs. Italian so I ordered both.  However, one CD (20 Grandes Exitos) is a 2 CD set and that's the one you want to stay with.  As of this review, it was $17.33 vs. $11.88 so stay with the $17.22 2 CD set because more of LP is better than less.  Of course, owning both sets is better because both are different.
B00F522C7C|1.0|The digital copy is not a &#34;copy&#34; that you can put on a computer or ipad. It is a permission only to watch it via streaming. I bought this to put on an Ipad so my kid could watch it on a plane trip. That apparently won't be happening unless I pay more money to buy it from itunes. Thanks a lot Disney. Amazon should label this differently. It is not a copy.
1608955702|5.0|Disclaimers:<br />1) I read a draft manuscript of this book and provided some proofreading assistance.  I received a finished copy, but I was under no obligation to write a review.<br />2) I do read the author's blog semi-regularly, and I have attended his workshops.<br /><br />Review:<br />In some ways, I think people learning about photography should read this book first before the author's other earlier books, primarily because this book spends some time describing the thought process the author uses to determine how he would light a given scene.  This thought process is important regardless of the lighting tools you have.<br /><br />Is the ambient light adequate or good?<br />If the ambient light is insufficient or bad, can I do something to change it without adding artificial lighting?<br />If I need artificial lighting, how can I use my artificial lighting?<br />Is the light source falling on my subject in a pleasing way?<br /><br />The first chapters go through the author's thought process on how he analyzes his lighting needs and later chapters tackle this topic in these areas.<br />a) Ambient light only<br />b) Single flash unit with and without a softbox (The 'revelation' that once you bounce flash off a surface, that becomes the 'softbox' is something beginners miss initially.)<br />c) Powerful studio light unit or multiple flash units, both with and without softboxes<br />d) Video light / Videographer light<br /><br />The book is easy to read and well-written.  The passages are not long-winded nor are they filled with jargon.  The content is to the point, without any joking around that some other authors use.  The writing is \\"just right\\" as if you were watching a presentation done by the author.<br /><br />The only minor nitpick I have is with the Guide Number tutorial near the end of the book.  The guide number can be used to calculate correct manual flash exposure, but it is a little esoteric for me.  It definitely works, but it's probably not the first thing I would do.  The shortcut at the end of that section is actually more practical, and I think easier to grasp for more people.  It might have been better just to leave the guide number discussion out.<br /><br />One reviewer commented that the book didn't offer anything new, and the content can be found on his blog.  Being a reader of the author's blog, that reviewer is correct, but it needs qualification.  Each chapter's content is derived from several of the author's blog entries.  The author wrote content for his blog at different points in time.  While the author sometimes refers to older blog articles in more recent blog entries, the older entries are generally *not* updated.  In addition, the blog entries are numerous; you can search the author's blog or use the site navigation, but you may not find what you seek.  Lastly, even if the author refers to his past articles, the author doesn't always connect the pieces into a new cohesive whole.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book is better than his blog in this particular application.  The book contains definitive, connected -- all the related, but separate blog entries are finally rewritten as one --, and updated content (including a few new photos) from his blog, so that a reader can find the most important topics the author wants to impart.  Of course, the book's contents may become \\"outdated,\\" but the book is currently handier to read the \\"good stuff\\" than searching for it through the blog.  Once someone reads this book, it should be easier to follow the author's blog or find other related blog content.<br /><br />Another reviewer criticized that the photos used in the book require professional-grade equipment that no average reader can hope to achieve.  Unfortunately, certain situations do require good equipment to get a usable exposure, but for other scenarios (i.e. general vacation photos, daylight scenes, typical indoors of a house), people with modest equipment can still apply the lighting thoughtprocess in the book to improve photos that they currently take.  (i.e. if you take vacation photos of the family, don't make them face the sun directly.)

B008QTVNUI|5.0|i love claire danes and i'm so happy that she has come back to tv. i've never been able to forgive her for leaving 'my so-called life,' but this certainly is a step in the right direction for making it up to me. the show has a creative plot with lots of twists and turns that keeps your attention. the other actors play their respective roles well.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I remember when they first started with the CGI...it was klutzy and only a step above hand-drawn animation.  But this movie -----WOW!<br /><br />I bought this for my grand daughter, but I've watched it more than her!<br /><br />The story is very cute and extremely entertaining.  The voice-over actors are spot-on with their characters.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|i don't think i need to review this product. it's the most popular show in the u.s. for a reason.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I really Love the free You Tube downloader. I easily find older music that I liked when I was younger and can enjoy it again via You Tube.
B00E7PQVHK|3.0|I've been playing this game for several days on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  The game is colorful, interesting and fun, but it's seriously marred by poor touch controls.  In every battle I play, it seems that I inadvertently remove the wrong unit, or a unit gets dropped in the wrong location, significantly affecting my strategy.  This happens even if I am being extra careful selecting units and moving units.  If it weren't for the control issues, this would easily be a 5 star game.
B0026KX6TY|5.0|great story and the performances were great.  Max Pomeranc especially.  DOn Pleasance is his usual presemne in fron of the camera.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I think this movie is a wonderful character study and what it was like to live in the tenements.  I have also read the book and totally enjoys all 850 (approx.,) pages.  Francie and Neely were wonderful characters as was Johnny their father. I have already watched the DVD 3 times.
0142428280|5.0|One of my favourite authors - every book I read by Mr. Follett, was most entertaining.  Always in suspense & always a page-turner!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie was pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't spectacular. It kept me entertained for most of the time, but still had a few boring parts. It's not one of those Disney shows that I would watch over and over again.
B00E9PMMX0|5.0|Its star wars whats not to love? you cant beat the price on amazon you wont find it cheaper anywhere else unless its used and all jacked up buy it new well worth it!
B003VTZTU8|5.0|This book starts out talking about strange medical devices that people have invented to help cure random problems. The author talks about why each of them are waste of money and why they don't work. He uses simple science to explain so any can understand. Later in the book he talks about other problems in the world that sound scientific but are just word plays to try and get someone rich. Great book for some easy fun reading.
B00E9PMML2|5.0|Its star wars whats not to love? you cant beat the price on amazon you wont find it cheaper anywhere else unless its used and all jacked up buy it new well worth it!
B00EJXX17S|5.0|I love Lindsey's beautiful violin technique and her enthralling performances. She brings the music to life with her dancing abilities. She has demonstrated many times that she is a master collaborator. I am a fan for life.
B003INBNXO|5.0|This was my first foreign movie I have seen with English subtitles and it blew my expectations out of the water this is a great action film and story line! must watch film!
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|This movie was not at all what I expected.  It did not seem to make sense and was just kind of weird!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My granddaughter is going to really enjoy this, she's six an loves different barbie items. It was a good buy and idea.
B0038QGXHW|5.0|I am a big Keith fan. This is wonderful mellow CD. I liked it from the start, and it has gotten better the more I listen to it.
B0030GJ50C|4.0|District 9 is definitely a must-see film! Neill Blomkamp does a wonderful job setting Johannesburg as the site of an alien introduction to the world. He really does incorporate real-life facets of South African life into the film in a way, I think only a true South African can. In my opinion it really is the little nuances and details that really allows a non-South African viewer, such as myself a glimpse into the world of South Africa. The cinematography and animation in District 9 are also on point. First of all, only one actor, Jason Cope, played every single &#34;prawn&#34; in the movie and Christopher Johnson's son is actually 100 percent computer generated which just blows my mind that that is even possible to use a computer to generate such a real-life looking object with real-looking movements and reactions and everything. Also, the animators were able to actually generate the animations even when the shaky cam was being used to film which proves some real talent on their parts. It really just goes to show how much technology has advance since animation began.<br /><br />Another interesting idea explored in the film is the fact instead of the aliens' spaceship landing in a big city like New York, London, or Tokyo, the ship landed over 1980s Johannesburg, South Africa. Johannesburg, for the rest of the word, is not a very relevant city but obviously the reason for the movie's setting is to introduce the theme of apartheid with which, again, Blomkamp succeeds. The distinctions that he makes between the humans and the prawns is almost identical as that between whites and black in South Africa during the apartheid era. Overall, this movie is fantastic and it really should go down as one the classics in time for film.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works exactly as described in the advertising.  I'm using it with a MacBook Pro.  Links easily via my wifi network and produces great picture and sound from variety of sources.  Great value for the money.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This app is very very cool, but similar to the old game.  The towers have all new upgrades, but the enemies aren't as unique.
B00DVPN30A|4.0|Great record, I like everything he does.  Only gave it four stars because it's not my favorite record.  On its on, it would be 5!
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Personally, I think this band is refreshed and more powerfully creative than ever before. The cd comes in a beautifully designed hardbound book, a confident presentation that says &#34;we're proud of this!&#34;. And they should be as this album has a depth and breadth that outshines anything they have done before. I understand the conviction of longtime Pearl Jam fans and their love of earlier Jam, but I think this album and &#34;Backspacer&#34; show a more confident and less deliberate creative process - good news for fans who want to see these guys continue to create awesome powerful empowering music in their own unique way. Maybe Eddie gets too much attention, but it probably doesn't bother the band members as much as some of the fans. Eddie brings more to the table these days - stronger lyrics, more powerful singing, more conviction and feeling.<br />  I listen to a lot of different stuff and don't focus on rock in particular, but I just love this cd and think there's good reason to expect to hear much more top notch stuff from this band. Give &#34;Sirens&#34; a listen, or &#34;Swallowed Whole&#34; - they're all good. I'm a new and devoted fan.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|This is a very entertaining movie if you turn your brain off. But there are big plot holes that I guess just are not important to film-makers anymore. They don't really need spaceships anymore since they can transport anywhere, and-- minor spoiler coming in the end of this very sentence, minor because it is so predictable-- they've also now cured death by using super blood. So, if there's any sense to the series reboot, the next installment should just focus two things--  1) long lines of practically immortal humans waiting to beam up to various M-class planets to ease overpopulation on Earth; and 2) much of the fleet getting scrapped.<br />But hey, it was fun, lots of things went boom, and that's all that matters, I guess.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I like this app, but I just happen to update the Yahoo! Mail app for my iPod touch which enables me to be able to choose a theme/background for my Yahoo! Mail page. And they did the same update for the actual Yahoo! mail page for the computer, including changing the actual logo for Yahoo altogether. So why hasn't this app been updated the same as the iPod touch app and the actual Yahoo! Mail website. It would be nice to see those updates!
B0086449YA|5.0|Of late, I've been thinking that I really need to move on from Mark Knopfler's solo stuff.  This album proves me wrong!!  I was also worried  that this new release, a 20-song double disc wouldn't be all that strong.  Wrong again!  About the only thing that's &#34;off&#34; about this disc is the title and the cover photo.  Other than that, this disc is on: a solid, classic Knopfler offering.<br /><br />Fans will remember how great discs like &#34;Golden Heart&#34; and &#34;Ragpicker's Dream&#34; were.  To me, &#34;Kill To Get Crimson&#34; and even &#34;Get Lucky&#34; were a bit spotty by comparison.  &#34;Privateering&#34; reaffirms Knopfler as a great writer, great guitar player and great singer.  There ain't a clinker on either of these discs, folks.<br /><br />With the help of Kim Wilson from Fabulous Thunderbirds on harp and studio vet Jim Cox on piano, Knopfler offers a wide variety of song stylings including irish-tinged, sea-flavored ballads (&#34;Haul Away&#34;, &#34;Kingdom Of Gold&#34;, &#34;Privateering&#34;), Be-Bop/Skiffle (&#34;I Used To Could&#34;, &#34;Corn Beef City&#34;), and lots and lots of cool Blues (&#34;Don't Forget Your Hat&#34;, &#34;Bluebird&#34;, &#34;Gator Blood&#34;).  If you liked songs like &#34;You Can't Beat The House&#34; or &#34;Punish The Monkey&#34;, these two discs will delight you.<br /><br />This is far and way my new favorite Knopfler disc.  Way to go, Mark!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It worked once.  The next several times we tried to use it, it would connect-disconnect-connect-...  It has never worked properly since.  We tried it with a desktop, laptop, tablet, & phone.  Very sad.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|This movie exceeded my expectations. Best Superman movie so far! The cast was excellent and very nice special effects and a good story.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Amazing book/story can't stop thinking about it, the drive for some humans is truly amazing. The respect I had for the seals multiplied by 100
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been unable to put this book down since I ordered it - I have since bought a copy for my sister...and then I have to buy a copy for my mom too, because I don't know who to give it to first.  Great story of a distopian society, with three main story lines, twists and turns...I can hardly wait to get to the end, yet I never want it to end - one of the best books I've ever read, hands down.

B00EB6ENXO|5.0|robert  downy jr does it again.!!!!!excellent movie. the ending tripped me out.it was great,everything you would want to see ironman to be.the special effects were outstanding..i see robert downy jr found his calling again and is sticking to it,i liked it so much i bought the movie and bought the digital copy to watch when im on the road.a must see movie for all.you will be surprized!!!and the digital copy has great special features. just wow!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the kind of book that the author will hate herself for in a few years to come.  As soon as she grows a conscience.  I love this story when I read it.  Read it along with all of my friends - then I grew a conscience and see it with a sick feeling in my gut.  Sucked.
B008JFUPPI|3.0|THIS MOVIE WAS OK.I FELT THE TWO ACTORS RYAN AND JEFF BRIDGES JUST DIDNT CLICK. HAVE GOOD SPEACIAL EFFECTS. PLOT WAS GOOD.SORRY TO RATE THIS OK BUT HAVE TO GIVE MY TRUE FEELINGS ON THIS.OTHERS MAY THINK THIS WAS GREAT. I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON EACH PERSON ON HOW THEY FEEL.WORTH WATCHING BUT THE ACTORS NEED TO CLICK AND TO ME THE DIDNT.
B00338QENI|5.0|Anyone who has taken a biology course has heard of HeLa cells.  This is the story of Henrietta Lacks, the unknowing donor of those cells more than 50 years ago and the story of her family's struggles to understand the contribution their mother made to medical research.  Medical consent and the perception of privacy was considerably different in the 1950s. This book does a great job explaining the evolution of medical testing, patients rights and tackles the concerns of the surviving Lackses in a fair and balanced way.  A good book. It was hard to put down.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Very fun to use to waste time.  Love all the actors who are doing a great job.  Wish there was no charge for season5.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|This is such a great film...I've watched it four times and know I will watch it many more to come. It's a nice little look at all 3 musicians. Jimmy is like wine-- he only gets better (and cooler) with age. I found it to be a great insightful look into what drives and motivates them as guitarists and artists.  3 very distinct styles that came together for one film. The best parts are when they are all sitting together, listening to each other play a riff and joining in or just watching the look on a genius' face as he is inspired by another genius. I also enjoyed the trips back in time to see how each got his start. Very impressed by Jack White, who is kind of the &#34;black sheep&#34; but makes you smile.  Lovely.....
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Very entertaining.  Always want to know what will happen next. All of the characters are flawed in small and big ways.  Good writing.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|Good movie but not as good as the first one.  Fun movie to watch with your kids though.  I have to admit as an adult I laughed out loud a few times.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was 'introduced' to this author when the love of my life gave me a copy of The Kite Runner & I quickly added Khaled Hosseini to my \\"authors I MUST READ\\" list.  \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\", quite simply, reinforced his position on that list.<br /><br />To allow myself to offer a detailed review of this book, would be a disservice to future readers, so allow me to simplify: buy this book.  Read it with an open heart & mind.  You will laugh. You will cry.  And, after you have finished it...Well, you will know, some where deep inside, that you are forever changed...Enjoy.  ;-)
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|All about trying to get you hooked so you will want to buy extra moves etc. to continue playing.Not worth it in my opinion.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't understand what all the fuss is about with this book - I hated it!  It was so boring and I couldn't  have cared less about the characters.  I only kept reading it cuz I thought the ending had to make up for the rest of the  book - I was wrong...awful ending.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Great game for kids and parents alike. The penguins are really cute and the music is fun.  Challenging and addicting!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|the best Stephen king book in a long time - the first one I could get through (in awhile) since it had none of the boring, minute detail!  More like this please.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game. It works great on my kindle fire. No glitches so far knock on wood. This version of castleville is better then the FB version. I love it... One tip you should know is that once you sale something on the trade ship you can't take it back. If the item do not sale the first time keep sending the ship out to sea until all items are sold. Eventually all items will be sold. I don't like not being able to get my unsold items back but this is a small issue compared to the overall game. I love how you don't have to use energy to play which means you can play the game for hours nonstop. If you like the FB version of this game you are really going to love this game. I highly recommend it.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|The Halo world has a rich story that has been waiting to be told. Sadly, not a lot of the Halo films out there come close to being as good as this one.<br /><br />You know it's good when even a non-Halo fan could understand it. On it's own, it could stand as a wonderful  Sci-Fi film, but the fact that it is very well directed and filmed makes it. You wouldn't even notice that it leads into a Halo video game. The acting may dip a little in some parts, but the music, scenery, direction, and story are superb. Even the CGI is really top-notch.<br /><br />I highly recommend you watch it, it's worth it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne is a great story teller!  The suspense makes you continue to read page after page and draws you into the story!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The first I have read in a long time that has evoked such a raw emotional reaction from me. I loved this. Every word.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My only complaint is that the game is not long enough.  I enjoyed the challenge of finding the different things in the rooms and having to put it all together to open the doors.  Make more rooms!!! All in all a great game :)
B00E9A656K|5.0|I'M having so much fun with this app. I want to try the classic app.  I grew up racing a 1969 Z-28.

B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Great season for the Doctor.  Its fun to have it &#34;on the run&#34; so to speak.  Came across nice and clear on my kindle.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|The app does everything that I need it do and more. Takes pictures, videos, and will even post to your social networks. I recommend it!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun way to pass time. The different puzzles are addictive and sometimes frustrating but makes for an interesting challenge. Yep yep
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Decent acting scenes and enough funny moments. Mediocre acting, multiple plot holes, and lots of cheesy moments. It's a movie you watch to see cool explosions and destruction caused by your favorite comic book heroes, not a movie you watch for quality film making.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has great descriptive writing. Although the story is obviously fiction, it is interesting and almost believable that this storyline could happen in the future. I like the fact that the author intertwines romance with a story of survival. I can't wait to read the next book.
B003YUWCJK|5.0|The elastic is very sturdy on these shoes. The shoes are a little small across the elastic but fit snugly for me. I love the shoes though very comfortable.

B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Great movie -- great characters -- great music -- perfect ensemble of actors at their best. It's no small wonder that this movie garnered so many Academy Award nominations -- I've already bought it.
B0000714BP|5.0|Can't add much more to what's already been said about this HILARIOUS movie except that I remember seeing it in the theater shortly after it came out and being absolutely astounded, blown away at the transformation of these 3 usually macho-role guys -- think of hunk Patrick Swayze in &#34;Ghost&#34; -- into these over-the-top drag queens.  I remember thinking, gee, Vida could almost be Patrick Swayze's sister, she looked that good.  A movie to watch again and again in case you miss something you didn't catch before.  Don't miss Robin Williams' brief scene in the Chinese restaurant -- A HOOT!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for this kind of thing. Until now I was just using a long HDMI cable to connect my computer to the tv in order to \\"cast\\" my desktop, tabs, or other things up there. This does that and more because it works with my iPhone, Kindle Fire, and Windows 7 computer.<br /><br />You should know that it does not work with my old Macbook Pro (it's a 2008) so I recommend checking the system requirements if you are not sure: [...]<br /><br />When I use it with the MacBook Pro, it works with things like YouTube and Netflix which are Chromecast compatible but when using it with a Chrome tab, it doesn't send any sound. (This is the same thing that happens when using an HDMI cable from the MacBook so I think it is something inherent in that generation of MacBooks and how sound output works.) The sound still comes out of the computer so a work around would be to use a wire from the headphone jack on the computer and connect it to the tv to get the sound to come out there.<br /><br />It works perfectly with my Windows 7 and with newer MacBooks and it is incredibly convenient to use. Also, not having to change anything to go from connecting my iPhone, Kindle Fire, tablet, computer... is really convenient, no wire to trip over.<br /><br />Also, I wondered about a power source before buying t so I'll let you know... it comes with a USB to mini-USB power cord and includes a plug for outlets as well. I have mine plugged into a power enabled USB port on my tv for convenience but if you don't have one available, you can put it into a wall socket.<br /><br />Set up was also really easy, just connecting it to Wifi using the computer, then it was all good to go. No changes or settings were needed for the tablets and phones to be able to connect because it all happens over the local Wifi network.<br /><br />Great stuff here and I'm looking forward to the growing number of applications that support it natively. For now, being able to send a Chrome tab to the tv, or cast netflix from my phone (instead of logging in with a video game system) is really convenient.cast netflix from my phone (instead of logging in with a video game system) is really convenient.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling's character development is superb and the woman does know how to work with words.  It's not the best book I've ever read, but it's a far cry from the worst.  This book is hard to put down because the characters are so despicable and you're anxious to find out what mess they're going to get into next.  I wondered if readers took potshots at the book just because it was Rowling.  .
B00FLNRN06|4.0|Funniest comedy I've watched in a while. The kids definitely needed to be out of the room though. A lot of F-bombs and a little nudity and of course the pot. Watch it it's Funny!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|why i gave this book a 1 star rating?<br />b/c i am not a 13 year old girl.<br />just a poorly written piece of sh**.. cough..i mean writing.
B0015DROBO|5.0|GREAT DELIVERY ON TIME AND GOOD PRICE.  TIMELY AND GOOD MERCHANDISE.  I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN. RECOMMEND THEM HIGHLY.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|Beautiful music. Boards of Canada does it again. Great music to chill out to. The album art is diffuse and gorgeous.
B003OUXECE|5.0|I haven't finished this book yet, but from what I've read, it has a ton of detail, and it gives quite a back story to Bioshock, and how Rapture came to be.
B004AUFVU0|5.0|This is an OUTSTANDING movie.  It is a classic from 1960 with two big names; Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine who work so well together.  It also has Fred MacMurray in a major supporting role..  The premise is from that era and would not play well today.  It is a wonderful story of love and romance (the two are not the same) between single partners.  If you are a fan of older movies you must see this one if you haven't already.  If you have seen it before it is well worth watching again.
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|Works as well as advertised.  I had been looking for a numerical keypad like this for 3 years and here it is at Amazon.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a good time waster when there is extra time before school. The kids like to play it when they have finished getting ready for school.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I loved this movie!! I thought it would be hard to follow with the language but it was not. Once you get into the story and the humor of this movie, you will love it!! Nathan Fillion steals this movie with his humor and portrayal of a the bumbling police officer. If you love all the Joss Whedon characters from Angel and Firefly, you will love this. Please give this movie a try and I think you will find it worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy to finnally have candy crush for kindle fire! Yay! I love this game and the way it challenges my brain.
B009AY04A8|3.0|The reason why I gave it an ok rating only because theirs so much dialog other than that very relaxing game w/ great scenes  - a collection of chapters to complete - if u have an interest in hidden objects kind of adventure w/ some added Minnie  puzzles u defiantly enjoy this .
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm a sci-fi fan - I go from Matrix to Aliens to these movies.  Totally different, but all very entertaining.  Star Trek as well, but might tie for 3rd place.  And the packaging for these is just great (the book format).  Plus you always have to watch these movies in the &#34;correct&#34; order, I suppose.  One movie that I have never seen is Revenge of the Sith.  Just fantastic!  Wow - ranks up there with The Empire Strikes Back.  If a person is a Star Wars fan, then you know the opening of each of these movies is a prize in and of itself - the opening STAR WARS logo with the accompanying strong trumpets, followed by the &#34;movie synopsis&#34; floating away in space......  That is worth it for each of these movies.
1626810915|4.0|This is broken up into several chapters that can all stand on their own. This is both the strength and weakness of this book. You can pick it up and read a chapter or two and put it it down for a few days and then open it up again reading any chapter. The chapters are short and a quick read. The downside is that the book does not really develop a theme or ideas that lead from chapter to chapter.<br />Overall, it is mainly a motivational book. Some good advise in there, too.<br />Just don't expect any profound wisdom about either sport or business.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|This movie is at the top of my list of all time favorites.  I might also add that the on-screen details in this blu ray version are stunning.  The &#34;only&#34; disappointment (if I can call it that) is the packaging, which I didn't read the contents correctly.  The Digibook is OK, but the movie more than makes up for this.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was fantastic. My family and I could not put it down.It was so so so so good. No book can be better to my opinion.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Stunning set - definitely a &#34;must have&#34; for an Alien movie fan.  I have not seen movies 1, 2, and 3 for a long time, but I was so thrilled to see all of these movies again.  The packaging is GREAT, a nice &#34;book&#34; with very cool art and the DVD's are well spaced out.  The movies are just the best if you are a Sci Fi fan of movies like these.  I'm really glad I went ahead with these.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|A very good movie featuring many of my favorite comic heroes from childhood.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to the sequel
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Feels like I have been waiting forever to play this! Loved the original, but this is much more entertaining. Love that you don't have to wait for energy, and there is more to do than just plant crops.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|A movie based on one of my childhood heroes.  It was a fairly good rendition, but could have been a little better.  The plot could have been moved along a little better and seemed at times to be a little chaotic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive in the fun way, provides a nice distraction when I'm stressed out. Wish I didn't have to wait to play again or pay.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I do love survivalcraft, but the demo isn't worth it. The game is almost the same as minecraft, but has some major changes that make the game different. But just get the FULL version and experience the true awesomeness of the game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this series!!!! I don't like to read but my sister insisted so I did....I wish the end would have continued like them moving into the awesome house and Ana' s pregnancy adventure....I wish it didn't rush it's self at the end and I'm sad that it is over and wished there would have been more books because I'm not ready to say good bye to Christian and Ana!!! What a fabulous love story!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Arrived very quickly. Very intuitive using a Chromebook and Samsung HDTV, had it set up within minutes. Watched Netflix movie and UTube videos wirelessly immediately. Very impressed with quality and price.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book.  I was completely hooked right from the start and was really sad when I ran out of words to read.  I read a lot, and this was my favorite book this year.
B009C7JS14|3.0|Well it does what it is supposed to do. I rate it at 3 stars, good all-around weather app. Peace out
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|Fast shipping on this item.  The Bluray itself is brand new, and plays really well on my PS3, comp, and regular Bluray player.<br /><br />Nice to have this one way before Disney US releases theirs in 2015.  Although that could very well have more features I had to have this now.
6305433909|5.0|This movie is so cheesy and awesome that I can't help but love it. If you liked Sister Act then you'll love this movie. It has some of the same characters as the first movie and with new characters that you'll love. The music is great, entertaining and it's heartfelt. I love this movie. If you're not a musical kind of person, this movie is not for you but if you are, well then get this movie and enjoy it again and again!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Insightful explanation of the circumstances that shape successful people. If you are inclined to think you did it all on your own, Gladwell will convince you that factors outside of your control played a big, very big part in your success.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|Can no longer play on the new Kindle fire. Says update needed but when it returns me to the App store nothing. Such a fun game too.
0547391005|5.0|I bought this for my 18 month old to lukewarm response.  Now, at 22 months old, she INSISTS we pick a story from this book every night and has learned that it needs to be carried with &#34;two hands, two hands.&#34;  This book has given our family great joy every night for several months and was well worth the investment!
B00C1040TO|5.0|This is a very powerful all-in-one tool for musicians, combining a tuner, metronome and recorder into one single app. I did a comparison test with my Korg tuner and a fender strat and jazz bass. The tuner in this app was spot on compared to the Korg - very impressive! The accuracy alone is worth the price of admission in my opinion. All the additional features - tuning history, tone selection, metronome, recorder - are all extra icing on the cake.<br /><br />The three required permissions are minimal - record audio (pretty obvious), read and write to external storage (most likely for the recorder function). There are no other add-ons - no Flurry or google analytics!<br /><br />I think the $1.99 price is fair, and it's absolutely a steal as today's free app of the day.
0316322407|5.0|IF you are only going to read one book this year, make it THIS book.  There is no book more worthy being sold today.  Author Christina Lamb does an extraordinary job bringing Malala, her story, and her family to life.  In fact, I predict that you will be greatly inspired by Malala, a girl of tremendous bravery.  At the same time, you will be awed by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai.  I know that I am.<br /><br />I recognize that there are great men living among us, but sometimes it take an epic event for their presence to be known outside their limited geography.  Rarely do men take the lead in fighting for women’s rights.  But in this book you will read about a man who has been fighting for women’s rights for his entire life.  That man’s name is Ziauddin Yousafzai.  Ziauddin is the Pakistani father of the very famous Malala Yousafzai, the heroine of this book.  Malala is the courageous young woman who stood up for the education of girls in Pakistan.  As a result, Malala was shot in the head by a member of the Taliban.<br /><br />Malala is an exceptionally brave young woman.  But, her father was more brave.  There could have been no Malala without Ziauddin, a man of astounding courage who has fought for his entire life for the education of all children in Pakistan, boys and girls.  When Malala was born, no one in the family was happy because she was a baby girl.  But Ziauddin stunned all by not only being happy about his daughter’s birth, but was extremely vocal about his pride to be the father of a daughter.  He insisted that his daughter be included in the family tree, much to the horror of other family members.  (Sadly, in most of the Muslim world, when daughters are born, everyone goes quiet with grief.  When sons are born, celebrations go on for days.)<br /><br />And so from the beginning of her life, Ziauddin’s daughter was lavished with love, attention, and books.  From the moment she reached the age of understanding, she knew that her father “had her back” and he would fight to the death to ensure that she, a mere girl in other’s eyes, would be treated equally with her two brothers.  And so Malala grew into her teenage years feeling confident that she had the right to speak her mind, to study, to learn, and to have and pursue dreams.  Ziauddin had taught his daughter how to struggle against injustice.  And Malala learned how powerful a person can be who speaks out against injustice.  Every child born deserves such a life.  Malala's confidence in breathtaking in a country where most women are afraid to speak their mind about anything, at least outside the four walls of their homes.<br /><br />When reading this book, I adored Malala, and I marveled at Ziauddin.  He grew up at a time when women’s feelings  were not even considered, yet he respected women, and was proud to  express his respect for females, insisting that his school be open to girls, too.<br /><br />Ziauddin is not only passionate and confident with his beliefs, but he is exceptionally wise about many aspects of life.  Here are just a few tidbits in the book shared by Malala:  “My father also loved to write poetry, sometimes about love, but often on controversial themes such as honor killings and women’s rights.”<br /><br />When a Mullah in their village started a campaign against Ziauddin’s school, open to girls and boys, Ziauddin was not afraid to fight back, telling others, ’Nim Mullah khatrai iman’ or, “A Mullah who is not fully learned is a danger to faith.”  (After living in the Muslim world for many years, I KNOW that it takes extraordinary courage for anyone to speak out against a Mullah.  Even powerful kings and dictators chose their words with care when addressing or discussing a Mullah!)<br /><br />When a doctor’s clinic was closed by the Taliban, the doctor approached Ziauddin for advice after the Taliban later offered to reopen the hospital.  Ziauddin advised his friend, “Don’t accept good things from bad people.”  He didn’t believe that a hospital protected by the Taliban was a good thing.  He was right, and not afraid to speak out against the brutal Taliban.<br /><br />When the Taliban first came to their valley (SWAT) many people welcomed them with open arms, much to Ziauddin’s dismay, for he knew they were wolves in sheep’s clothing.  Later after the Taliban completely took over and began to murder many people, everyone was forced to flee.  When they returned to their village, they found a letter from a Pakistani soldier condemning the villagers for allowing the Taliban to gain control Swat.  Ziauddin told his daughter, “This is typical.  We people of Swat were first seduced by the Taliban, then killed by them and now blamed for them.  Seduced, killed and blamed.”  In fact, Ziauddin was being generous.  He was never seduced.  In fact, he fought against the Taliban from the first day until the last.<br /><br />When Ziauddin received death threats from the Taliban, he refused to give up his activities to educate children or to stop warning his friends against cooperating with the Taliban.  Even after his friends were shot in the face by the Taliban, he kept on course.  Everyone believed that Ziauddin would be next.<br /><br />But it was his bold and courageous daughter who was shot.<br /><br />After the attempted murder of Malala,  we learn from Malala that her father  &#34;…argued that all he had ever wanted was to create a school in which children could learn….”  “My only ambition,” Ziauddin said, is to educate my children and my nation as much as I am able.  But when half of your leaders tell lies and the other half negotiating with the Taliban, there is nowhere to go.  One has to speak out.”<br /><br />Although Ziauddin was unusually courageous, he was often frustrated, once saying, “I have a school, but I am neither a khan nor a political leader.  I have no platform.  I am only one small man.”<br /><br />I beg to differ:  Ziauddin, you are NOT a small man.  You are a lion of a man, the greatest of men, one of the most courageous men I’ve ever had the pleasure to read about — a man unafraid to go against entrenched ideas and prejudices fully embraced by your society.<br /><br />When Mala’s mother continued to believe that women should not go out of the house, and should not speak to any man not of her family, Ziauddin told his wife:  “Pekai, purdah is not only in the veil, purdah is in the heart.”<br /><br />Ziauddin kept a famous poem (written by Martin Niemoller, who lived in Nazi Germany) in his pocket:<br /><br />First they came for the communists,<br /><br />and I didn’t speak out because I wasn’t a communist.<br /><br />Then they came for the socialists,<br /><br />and I didn’t speak out because I wasn’t a socialist.<br /><br />Then they came for the trade unionists,<br /><br />and I didn’t speak out because I wasn’t a trade unionist.<br /><br />Then they came for the Jews,<br /><br />and I didn’t speak out because I was not a Jew.<br /><br />Then they came for the Catholics,<br /><br />and I didn’t speak out because I was not a Catholic.<br /><br />Then they came for me,<br /><br />and there was no one left to speak for me.<br /><br />I have discovered that it is very difficult to bring positive kind of change to our world.  And, as hard as women might fight against abuses, we cannot bring this kind of massive social change until men stand by our side.  If only every thinking men would come forward like Ziauddin Yousafzai to fight for women’s rights.  If only every man would live as Ziauddin Yousafzi has lived, soon we could defeat the abuses man inflicts upon women.<br /><br />Ziauddin Yousafzi is a modest man, calling himself a “small man,” but in fact he is one of the greatest men ever to walk this earth.  I am sure that his daughter Malala will agree with me.  Because of her father, she embraces the world with a strong spirit and great intelligence.<br/><br />Malala is receiving the praise and support that se deserves.  Let's not forget her father, the man who made a girl named Malala possible.  We should all nominate Ziauddin Yousafzi for next year’s Nobel peace prize, and for the TIMES man of the year.  We need to hold him up as the kind of hero young boys should emulate.  We need many more men like Malala's father.<br /><br />Ziauddin Yousafzi is a real man.ou are NOT a small man.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|Interesting in that it felt like an allegory. Would have liked to understand the zombies more, but it's the humans that count.
B000002UWF|5.0|An excellent sampler of Louis 's hits on Capitol.  The Capitol Collector's Series lives up to it's reputation.  Good sound, informatine notes, and some nice rare tracks.  A good value and great listening.  Thanks AMAZON.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love this game! played it for a good long time,purchased coins,minions&amp;completed many missions but it kept freezing my screen forcing me to lose. it also had my kindle acting funny everytime I played it. I was sad to have to pull the plug on it but I had no choice:( the freezing of the screen was really annoying me.
B000002LND|5.0|If you're a Madonna fan you have to have this one in your collection. She is still one of the greatest entertainers of our time. Sorry Gaga, Miley, Brittany.....Madonna did it way better when they were in diapers. She had a different persona and presence in every video that these pop-tarts today dont come close to.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Fantastic free app that can be linked on your phone, tablet, and computer. Happy to not have to worry about losing notes when I switch phones.  Love it!
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|Way too much work to write here.  This is not necessary. Ten more words, ten more words, ten more words.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Movie came in perfect condition! Definitely a must for any twilight fan, and the bonus content was pretty cool! Definitely recommend!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This was a choice for book club, and when I first started reading it I didn't realize it was a true story. Here were my thoughts as I was reading the first 29 pages (before it occurred to me this was the real thing), &#34;Oh great (insert sarcasm), a story about a woman getting in trouble and going to prison...written by someone who's never had the experience.  I doubt I'll like this.&#34;  And I had been reading it the way I almost always read fiction...fast.  Once light dawned on me, I thought &#34;Whoa, wait, what?  This is non-fiction?&#34;  Ohhh.  That's when I put the brakes on, slowed down and digested every word.  And I liked it a LOT.  It was well written with humor, completely drawing me into the prison.  I felt like I was right there with her in the cell and dinner line.  I really felt I got the &#34;inside&#34; scoop on what it's like at Danbury.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Neo-Classic King!  Love how he draws you into believing you're part of the story, a character just off to the side, watching with bated breath!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Once I started reading  this book, I was staying up each night until about 1 or 2 in the morning to read it, just because it was a great book, that I just couldn't put down. I will admit that at the end I cried, because it was sad. The plot and characters were amazing, and John Green made this story different from other books, in a good way. Even though I cannot relate to having cancer or really knowing someone with cancer, this story struck me in a way a book has never done.
0316204366|2.0|Many readers mistakenly assume that they should read books with a clear thesis, evidence that is accurately reported, and proofs that actually support the claims being made. But this assumption, though intuitively appealing, is wrong. In fact readers should read books that have vague and unclear theses indistinguishable from common sayings, evidence that is tendentiously reported, and proofs that often are of questionable relevance to the claims made by the author.  A.K., a book editor at a major publishing house, has built a career on publishing books that meet the second understanding of what readers should read. She says &#34;books like this create critical thinkers since readers are then able to poke holes and find flaws in nearly every page they are reading.&#34;<br />Malcolm Gladwell's books, David and Goliath included, are prime examples of this sort of book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Simply an excellent book.  Very well written, complicated characters that come together in very interesting ways.  Not as violent as his first book, The Kite Runner.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Lovely! I watched this movie with my husband and my 4 years old son. Funny!  We liked it very much!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is so awesome when you fight and the graphics are good and it gets harder the more bosses you beat.
B004X75RK4|4.0|2 time watching this movie. First time I watched back in 2009. This movie was so perfect after a very stressful day at work.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The game is nice so is the graphics I just running out money so fast and having to spend real money to get money
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a awesome app its one of my favorite apps I have it on two Devices but I would only recommend this app for people who don't get frusturated easy and likes puzzles as well as has LOTS OF PATIENTS
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Worked fine as expected (although I didn't test gigabit speeds). It will really come handy when I need to troubleshoot some jacks with my ethernet-less tablet convertable (asus t100).
1451666179|5.0|I love Allie's sense of humor, her silly illustrations, and her attitude about depression and coping with all the weirdness in life. I'm a huge fan of her blog and was excited to get this book! There were some classic bits from her blog, and some new stories, too. I especially liked the bit on procrastination. HAH!! A fun read.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Even though the book is nothing like the movie, it is fantastic and a good read.  A very good read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Ooooooh, how I love me some Downton Abbey! The upstairs drama, the downstairs shenanigans -- death, love, intrigue, romance, it's all here. Watch out for Mr. Pamouk!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read it in two days both times I have read it. A truly captivating story told in a way that keeps you turning the pages with bated breath.
B00004W3L3|3.0|It sounded good for a few weeks but then became tiring.  I think that the instrumentalists just have not refined their parts enough.  It feels like an over-produced demo recording of a band with real potential.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Great movie, we had just got back from Paris and could not believe the places we had been too. It was like taking a mini vacation every time we watch the movie.
0882709194|5.0|The introductory foreword is very thought provoking and asks tough questions that should not be just brushed aside without serious consideration.  The questions regarding the circulatory system are especially heavy.  Also, the facts presented about the effects of radiation upon the information contained within DNA deserve your further study.
0062064304|5.0|A really great art book, i'm a BIG fan of the movie and the creature designs. Definitely worth it .
158567057X|5.0|This book is a total crack-up.  Plus it features my favorite lost positive, gruntled, in the first chapter.  (BTW, Microsoft's spell-check just then suggested gruntled is not a real word.  Aaarrrrgh, it did it again!)
B0083SBJXS|5.0|there are certain movies I can watch over and over without them losing their luster and this is one of them.<br />This is a great movie.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|As is the case of many books made into movies, if you didn't read the book, you missed out on a great story.  The movie with all it's vivid sexual scenes were probably done to increase sales.  The book was a great read.  The big problem I had was the translation from Swedish into English.  Also the many Swedish towns in the book meant nothing to me.  If I had visited Sweden, I would have enjoyed the book much more than I did. Larrson is an excellent story teller and I was sorry to hear he is no longer with us...
B000FBH3XQ|5.0|I cant believe you publish the crap you do from reviewers that just write to hear themselves. A bunch of blowhards. Discs were great
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I loved The Shining (and the movie was better), so I was truly looking forward to this sequel.  Very, very disappointed.  Dull, tedious, formulaic.  You may like it, but I would certainly suggest you save your money.
B00GD9F59S|4.0|The ending blows you away. I do need to admit to some cursing of the fates, but I have to grudgingly admit the ending is the right one. What an awesome series that touches on really difficult social situations made much more interesting with whole Greek god paranormal  theme.  It'd be an awesome movie! 4+ stars !
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I love the old standard &#34;Classics&#34;  Great to listen to even if you were not a Willie Nelson fan.  Loved Matchbox.  Willie on Guitar is awesome.,
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Fun little game.  The gameplay is pretty different than most Castle Crusher style games and as such feels fresh.  It also adds a new level of challenge in simply learning how to play it.  There are a reasonable amount of levels and modes to play through and the game's difficulty increases smoothly as it goes on.  My only real gripe is that there is only one, maybe two music tracks and it kinda wears on you after a while.  All in all though, this is a great game with a fresh take on an old concept and I'd recommend it to most people.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|This is by far one of Cher's best albums. It's just incredible. I had my doubts but nearly every track is pure Cher perfection!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love how this app can help me relax and drift off so quickly. I travel and it helps me get past that new bed uncomfortable feeling.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun and easy to pick up for just a few minutes<br /><br />I like this type of game for my lunch break
B0013V33DG|5.0|The world's greatest singers performing a very funny Donnizetti opera.  This is the same production that was put on by the Met in HD, but this is the Covent Garden performance.  This opera was a great Beverly Sills role, and has a long tradition at Covent Garden, where they refer to it simply as &#34;Daughter&#34;.  This show is somewhat famous for the seven high C's hit by the tenor Juan Diego Florez.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|These are great.  Perfect size for little hands. Really cute looking baby animals ( which my grandson loves). And the price again was really good in comparison to other stores I checked.
B00GQ8MZDU|2.0|I just bought the Dexter Season 8 Episode 9for $1.99, but when I went to play it, the only thing that plays is the 30 second preview scene. Please provide me with the link for the episode that I bought, Amazon!! :(
B0090SI4OC|4.0|It is a good thing I saw this movie before I realized this was from the author of the Twilight Saga.  Unlike that prior franchise of films, this film is actually kept going by its good acting, good storyline and great dialogue.  From William Hurt playing a key supporting actor role, to Saoirse Ronan playing the chief protagonist, this movie is actually anchored by the acting and dialogue, whether it be the flashbacks, to the romance scenes, to the occasional action scenes.  As a science fiction film, the special effects are kept to a minimum, but are very effective.  The fiction part of the science fiction is quite believable, as the entire context of how and why the aliens come to Earth and stay on Earth seems logical.  No contrived scenes or over-the-top shoot-outs in this combination of drama, romance and suspense
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing an addicting game. When I first got it I couldn't stop playing. Plain epic. Best game ever. My 2nd favorite.
B00AEBBAEU|4.0|Given the dominance of the oil industry in American life, culture, economy and politics, it is surprising that so few films are made about it.  This movie starring Daniel Day Lewis is probably the biggest movie about the oil industry to come out in decades.  Taking place in the California before suburbs took over, this movie follows the life and career of one oilman driven to succeed at any cost.  Over the course of 2+ hours, we see how the rough-and-tumble life of the early oil industry created men that were themselves hard, manipulative and vengeful.  The relationship between the oil industry and organized religion is also explored as a major plot-line in this film, with oilmen clearly coming out on top of the men of god.  Both of these points bear great importance in understanding the course of 20th century history both inside and outside America.  The one key point missing from this film that would have made it complete, is a tangent into Wall Street, showing how oil men eventually and universally put their money into financial speculation.  Overall, a very intense film, good for those interested in such a subject, but probably boring for those who are looking for entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a awesome game and u should get it because it really test it mind if u want a mind testing game
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|This movie was a guilty pleasure.  I wanted something to veg out for 90 minutes and was not disappointed.  Karl Urban maintains the comic-book facial expression throughout the movie, which in and of itself was a galactic crack-up.  This movie did not take itself too seriously, had a lot of action and diverted me away from the real world for a period of time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best arcade games, even better than subway surfers and temple run! This game is amazing with great choices of the setting and character!
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I downloaded this game 4 times and each time it glitches on the apples at the very beginning of the game. It won't do anything other than water the apples. It's broken.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like this game a lot it's cute and fun and I'm glad you need energy to do anything in it
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Disappointing story through and through.  Not overly sad about the death of Tris - just felt the story was flat.  I struggled to finish it.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|Interesting a little hard to understand the language but once you get locked in you begin to connect and feel for poor Alex.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It's making my Kindle freeze up. I hope I don't have to ask friends for lives to move forward with this one.
0545586178|5.0|...and the trilogy continues.  What a great read!  I've continued the trend of reading each of the series prior to seeing the movie shortly after.  Collins continues to write good characters, I genuinely wanted to keep reading to see what would happen to them.  This one felt a little &#34;uneven&#34; - it was very slow going for quite awhile, but then became extremely fast paced and tense.  Katniss, Peeta, and company are as good as always.  President Snow was featured more in this one, and makes for a great villain.  I can not wait to see how this one gets wrapped up in the final book of the trilogy!
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|Very similar to Mattel's Monster High line, with a few variations, but overall the same quality. Most notable differences are the rounder heads, plus that fact they are fairy tale based characters and not monsters. The outfits, accessories, and dolls themselves are very well detailed, right down to their adorable shoes.  These are great doll for both playing and collecting.<br />The details on this couple are just amazing. Ashlyn’s shoes, purse, and other accessories really tie in to Cinderella perfectly as well as her shoe OCD personality. With those crystalline kicks she’s sporting I can relate to her shoe obsession &#62;_&#60; Hunter is very detailed, lots of textures on his outfit, messenger bag and his shoes. Once again, there are amazing details on the clothes and accessories.<br />I can’t wait for my daughter to play with her Ever-After High power couple on Christmas morning.
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|The mixed reviews is why it took me so long to watch this movie, but overall I think it was a good movie. It has a lot of twists and turns, but if you pay attention, everything seems to blend together okay. Regardless of the mixed reviews, it is a movie worth watching.  I may even read the book for comparison, since the books are normally better than the movie.
B00DGQP442|5.0|Very similar to Mattel's Monster High line, with a few variations, but overall the same quality. Most notable differences are the rounder heads, plus that fact they are fairy tale based characters and not monsters. The outfit, accessories, and dolls themselves are very well detailed, right down to their adorable shoes.  This is a great doll for both playing and collecting. The lips however do not resemble the close-up picture of Apple White. They have 3 dots on the bottom lip to simulate gloss I suppose. I suppose it’s due to mass production and the close-up picture is probably a promo picture.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|um, Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba are in it.....that's enough for me to watch it.......it was good, not great.......still worth watching.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Great book! It changed my life. The author did justice to the title of the book with profound personal testimonies and the testimonies of others. Great book! I recommend it to every college undergraduate and new graduates who are on a journey of self-discovery.
B000IZ8DZQ|2.0|The movie has no definitive ending and puts itself in a precarious place out of no other reason than stupidity. Acting was terrible, especially Michael Caine, and the final heist lacked cleverness.

1616550414|4.0|This book is a great history of the legend of Zelda. My only complaint is that I wish it included more of the older titles like The Adventure of Link and Link's Awakening. It needs to focus on those titles more than Skyward Sword.

1250038820|5.0|I followed Brandon's Facebook feed for quite a while and when I discovered that there would be a book I pre-ordered and still waited anxiously for it to be delivered. The very idea of this type of book is a miracle of imagination and the individuals that are portrayed show a great cross section of the residents of NYC. I have decided that Brandon must have the most congenial of approaches to not have been mugged and thrown to the ground any number of times.  There is no way I can express how important this type of documentation is needed so that we can all celebrate the diversity of the world.

B00E4W40C4|5.0|I've been a Wolverine fan for the last 25 years, and this is the Wolverine movie I've been waiting for, for most of my fan life.  A great story that is less about saving the world and more about the characters, very little CGI, and lots of claw-slashing, all the while staying true to the spirit of the comic character.  I think Wolverine works best in exactly this kind of film, and Mangold pulled it off very, very well.  The last act wasn't the best in that it strayed from all the things that made the first 2/3 great, but it's forgivable, certainly compared to previous X-Men films.  This could have been another disaster, but it turned out to be immensely enjoyable comic character piece.  The extended edition has some great little perks for fans.  Definitely worth picking up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is cool I just started but seem on a good start , tho you need not waste your gems FYI Apaloosa it's 125 in coins  NO WASTE

B005COO1X6|2.0|it was a rewrite of Christine. do not know where the car came from or where it went. to many questions unanswered and way to short. I was greatly disappointed in this Stephen King story.
0670026603|5.0|If you haven't read this don't read any further, you may consider it as a spoiler...<br /><br />As much as I didn't want this ending, I understood the difference between ones choice for self and ones choice for others. It was a beautiful story, one that you have to allow yourself to be put in the situation of each character and understand what it would mean to live or die. To live for others in constant pain and always fearful of illness, or die with true love in your heart...some books you read, and some you live. I lived this and I cried terribly. Will and Lou will alaways have a place in my heart.

0385523394|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year. I'll admit I picked it up because of its voyeur aspect. I imagine most of us want to know what it is really like on the “inside”. The book focuses on what Piper learned while she was in prison, but along the way she taught me a few things too – like how it is so easy to view the world through an “us vs. them” perspective when the reality is that the dividing line is more fluid.<br /><br />One of the reasons this book resonates across a wide audience is that Piper doesn’t fit the stereotypical prisoner mold. She’s well-educated. She has a support system. A loving family. She’s white. By all accounts, she shouldn’t be in prison. Yet due to some really stupid decisions, here she is. I’ve been taught to equate prison with “bad” people, but what I took from this book is that is not always true. The choices may be bad, but that doesn’t mean the people are. I also have the utmost respect for her because she takes ownership of her mistakes. There’s no blame or finger pointing. She accepts her punishment with as much grace as she can muster because she realizes that no one put her there but herself.<br /><br />PS – I’ve heard the TV show is a sex-fueled romp, but that’s not true of the book. So if you are avoiding the book based on that idea, don’t let it deter you.

0446310786|2.0|If disliking To Kill a Mockingbird is heresy then you'd better start piling wood on the stake for me.<br /><br />Ultimately it came down to expectations.  I thought I was reading a book about children, but it turned out I was reading a fancy children's book.  Perhaps I've lost my youthful innocence but I found the first hundred-plus pages of the book to be an absolute bore.  And then Scout and Jem build a snowman.  And then Scout and Jem go to school.  And then Scout and Jem play a make-believe game with Dill.  And then they find some treasures in a tree.  And then they go to school again.  Writers are often motivated by childhood nostalgia, and that's well and good, but like eating an entire bag of Halloween candy in one sitting, there comes a point of gross overindulgence.<br /><br />I think it's worth mentioning that I don't find anything wrong with employing a juvenile narrator.  Two of my favorite books, The Catcher in the Rye and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, are of course narrated by adolescents.  The reason I find those classics so much more successful than To Kill a Mockingbird is because Salinger and Twain told their stories with the language native to a young person while limiting their observations to those that Holden Caulfield and Huckleberry Finn were likely to have.  Harper Lee, on the other hand, seemed to want it both ways.  She wanted the voice and perspective of a 1st person child narrator and 3rd person omniscience whenever she felt she needed it.  In my opinion that doesn't work.  A writer must choose one or the other.<br /><br />Halfway through the book we at last stumble upon the meat of the story, and it's really quite juicy.  Truth be told, I thoroughly enjoyed the trial scene, but afterwards the story seemed to just fizzle away again.  For me the denouement was as tedious and predictable as a sultry summer day in Alabama.  I'm being harsh.  Boo Radley!  Can you ever believe it???<br /><br />Like millions of readers throughout the years, my copy of To Kill a Mockingbird declares it to be a \\"timeless classic\\".  Despite my criticism I look at those words and I begin to doubt myself.  Certainly something is wrong with me.  My tastes are boorish.  My imagination has atrophied.  I am ignorant of greatness.  I open the book again, read half a page and set it back down.  Then I remember what another famous female writer of the South, Flannery O'Connor, once said of To Kill a Mockingbird:<br /><br />\\"I think for a child's book it does all right.\\"
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I choose books that will hold my attention from cover to cover.  If a story takes 3-4 chapters to grab me, I usually give it up. Not so with &#34;Sycamore Row&#34;--it met my expectations.

B00DQAM5LI|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold have been kicking out one good, if not exactly original effort after another for well over a decade now (twelve years, to be exact), and on full-length release number six, the band continues this trend, with \\"Hail To The King\\" proudly showing the band's roots in traditional/true blue metal heavily inspired by the likes of Metallica, Guns `N' Roses, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Whitesnake. But this Huntington Beach-based quintet differentiates from many other metal bands in their shoes in that they can manage to sound both indebted to other bands while simultaneously retaining their own signature sound. The end result is a sound that has served them very well over the years, and continues to do so, here. After all, a band that has gone gold more than once, even in this world of reduced music sales, has to be doing something right.<br /><br />Opener \\"Sheperd Of Fire\\" is vintage A7X, as it finds Matt's trademark nasal crooning being laid over a crunching guitar groove, and tacks on some infectious, deliciously melodic sweep picking for good measure. The title song is similar in that it, too, boasts memorable vocal patterns and ginormous refrains, including soaring clean vocal hooks in the choruses, and catchy, hardcore-ish chanting in the post-choruses. The very, very, GNR/Velvet Revolver-esque \\"Doing Time\\" is another piece of radio-ready fair, as it is also filled with irresistible vocal hooks; but then the band takes on a much heavier and more metallic route with \\"This Means War,\\" which boasts crunching, staccato, Metallica-meets-Pantera riffing, especially angsty vocals, and fiery melodic soloing. And \\"Requiem\\" is also exceedingly heavy, as it adheres to a crunchy, chugging thrash groove, and is topped off by a totally, ripping, lengthy, and thus extraordinarily memorable, wah-tinged guitar solo (which is the main highlight of the track).<br /><br />Once the listener gets over the initial shock of Avenged Sevenfold blatantly stealing the melody from Metallica's \\"Fade Into Black,\\" for their own song (\\"Crimson Day\\"), you begin to realize that it is a touching piece of emotional power balladry. And the fact that it sounds like almost an exact replica of that 1984 jingle just means it is A7X's way of showing their love, and paying homage to their influences. \\"Heretic\\" is extremely Metallica-esque, too, in that it finds Matt's clean, catchy vocals soaring over the top of thrashy, Kirk Hammett-inspired chugging, and includes a melodic breakdown, too, with an again distinctly Metallica-esque clean/acoustic guitar tone. And \\"Heretic\\" is further highlighted by a strong, grumbling bass line, and screaming guitar solo, to boot. Next up, \\"Coming Home,\\" which finds guitarists Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates trading off a series of lengthy, blistering, sweeping solos before eventually conjoining together and harmonizing perfectly off of each other, is another big standout track.<br /><br />However, on the downside, \\"Coming Home\\" actually proves to be the record's last good song, what with \\"Planets\\" and \\"Acid Rain\\" both being decent but ultimately forgettable and skip-worthy tracks. The former, despite its prevalent use of Matt's strong pipes, exceptional, and steep guitar soloing, and dramatic-sounding drum rolls, is actually a pretty boring cut. And so is the latter, \\"Acid Rain,\\" a solemn closing ballad that might boast a darkly melodic piano line and some nice, bluesy guitar soloing, but is ultimately one that comes across sounding more like a b-side than anything. Needless to say, neither of these two closers are bad by any stretch, but neither of them add much to the equation, or are really worth more than one listen.<br /><br />On the whole, though, \\"Hail To The King\\" does fare a lot better than both of these two lackluster cuts put together. So, as with pretty much any album in this band's oeuvre, \\"Hail\\" can be chalked up as an effort that is not without flaw, but not one that all fans of heavy yet melodic metal/metallic hard rock should find to be an enjoyable listen. It is decent pretty much through and through, even if it is rarely ever amazing.odic metal/metallic hard rock should find to be an enjoyable listen.

B000001FFR|5.0|Back in the day, and by that I mean back when New York's finest did not keep fans waiting eight years for a new album (as they did following 2003's \\"We've Come For You All\\"), Anthrax were an inexorably brutal thrash/speed metal band with some power metal influence. This fact is presented crystal clearly on the group's second full-length effort, 1985's \\"Spreading The Disease,\\" a very appropriate title for this record in that it is a highly contagious and infectious one. It is rooted in no-holds-barred thrash picking and pounding back beats, but iced off with oddly tuneful and harmonic clean singing. The end result plays like a non-stop, forty-four-minute long ball of white hot rage and hyper-kinesis.<br /><br />Indeed, from the very second the exhilarating opener, \\"A.I.R.,\\" begins until the last second of the uncompromisingly off-the-rails and double-bass-driven closing blast, \\"Gung-Ho,\\" the intensity and frenetic energy levels are never compromised in favor of obligatory balladry or uninspired (or even half-hearted) riffing. A definite Metallica-esque vibe is present on the aforementioned opening \\"A.I.R.,\\" a track that hits the ground running with pounding thrash grooves, violently thrashing guitar leads, lots of double bass drumming, and ripping, piercing shred soloing. The vocals in this song are also of note, as they are of the Iron Maiden-ish variety, and are sure to include plenty of anthemic choruses, as well.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Lone Justice\\" finds a good bass intro giving way to thrashing grooves, and catchy, galloping riffs; \\"Madhouse\\" is a crunchy chugger; and \\"Medley\\" absolutely flies by with its blistering riffage, soloing, and catchy, call-and-response vocal patterns. And what to make of the mid-tempo chugger that is \\"The Enemy\\"? Well, it certainly does differentiate from the norm in that it allows the listener his or her first chance to really catch their breath, but is nevertheless a vehement, vitriolic, and caustic anti-Nazi rant, and a tirade that cuts right down to the bone.<br /><br />But immediately following this comes the blistering \\"Aftershock,\\" which overflows with streamlined, chainsaw-fast guitar leads and screaming, white-hot soloing. Then we get \\"Armed And Dangerous,\\" which puts the album back on the more restrained side of the line, as it is a Judas Priest-y ballad, at least in part. And the other part of it is a blistering, blood-pumping thrasher with ripping speed, insistent double bass thudding, fiery solos, and killer (and thus instinctively memorable) choruses.<br /><br />And the set is rounded out by \\"Medusa,\\" a track that plays more-or-less like a piece of pure power metal, what with its tuneful, Bruce Dickinson-lite vocals icing a musical bed of hook-heavy crunch and chug riffing and winding melodical solos. Said tune is also of note for featuring some catchy, call-and-response vocal patterns in its choruses, thus making them sound not unlike a precursor to 1986's \\"Among The Living.\\" It is just one other song that serves to beg one final, irrefutable question: Why should you bother waiting the excruciatingly long periods of time for new Anthrax material when the old-school stuff rocks so darn righteously?!t cuts right down to the bone.<br /><br />But immediately following this comes the blistering \\"Aftershock,\\" which overflows with streamlined, chainsaw-fast guitar leads and screaming, white-hot soloing.

B005LAIH9A|4.0|“American Reunion” is exactly what the film’s title means: reunion of the characters of the “American Pie” series. They are older and just a little wiser, but the jokes, mostly sex-related, remain the same, with Jason Biggs doing the famous “pie” joke in a totally different way. And that is a good thing after all because that is what we want from the series.<br /><br />So, all the principal characters come back, with Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), now happily married. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is also married, but Oz (Chris Klein), now a LA sportscaster, is not. Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas) seems to have been travelling around the world and as to Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), well, he never changes. Tara Reid and Mena Suvari also return, but their roles are not very big. Natasha Lyonne appears only in one scene.<br /><br />It’s good to see Eugene Levy as Jim’s father and Jennifer Coolidge as Stifler’s mother sharing the screen for the first time together. You will also meet other cast members including John Cho, Shannon Elizabeth and Chris Owen.<br /><br />The latest installment refuses to slow down, with silly jokes that are almost as effective as those in the original released back in 1999. Directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, the film, though no longer refreshing, still knows what it is doing: a gross-out comedy with sweet nostalgia. And as such it works.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I think this is probably the best of the Craig/Bond franchise. Daniel Craig seems to have settled into the character and has an outstanding grittiness that feels more 'Bond' than any have in recent years. Having said that, there are a few problems with this one. The movie still relies too heavily on extended action scenes - almost like it doesn't trust itself to not constantly be in motion. The fight scenes also feel a bit too choreographed with an almost techno beat of punches and kicks. between the two, I honestly felt like Javier Bardem was speaking directly to the audience when he says &#34;all this running and jumping and fighting... it's exhausting!&#34;. One could easily edit 15-20 minutes out of the run time with a little less time on each fight/chase. Now, just to be clear, I understand that this is an action/adventure film and that the nature of the character isn't talkative, but even action adventure can be smart and Daniel Craig's connection with the character is too good to waste on formulaic genre techniques.<br /><br />On a positive note, I think that Ralph Fienne's joining the cast as M is a great move. Judy Dench was also a very good choice and it's a pity much of her run as M was with Pierce Brosnan. With some luck, the franchise will continue to attract a better support for what is the best Bond in a couple of decades. Now if they could just let go of some of the conventions.

B00E8S2KV2|5.0|This movie is in the directors famous epic story telling, and in the tradition of adding extra footage in this extended edition, makes this movie a pure joy to watch. Can't wait to see the next installment in theaters this December. The extra discs and bonus stuff just makes it better.
0441009425|4.0|Interesting style. Took me around 150 pages to get into it, but then I liked it. Plot was nicely woven together and had a satisfying conclusion. I was expecting the themes to be more insightful into human nature, or the workings of the world, or something generalized, but no, they're just consistent with the story and self contained.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Saw this movie awhile ago and loved it as I do all of Miyazaki's movies. Just somehow, this one wasn't in stock where I shopped so had to wait awhile till I could purchase it. Great price here and loved being able to own it and add it to my Miyazaki collection.
1937053571|5.0|If you have NOT read Half-Blood, Pure, Deity or Apollyon, please read with caution. There are some spoilers that were unavoidable. Proceed with caution . . .<br /><br />I love Seth, I love him so much. I know everyone else is on the Aiden train and I get that but dammit, you can't change my mind. Unless you threw Caleb in to the mix then we might have some issues but this shouldn't be surprising to anyone who knows me and what characters I tend to lean toward. Aiden is amazing, do not get me wrong, he is beyond amazing; perfect even, as Alex describes him as that many times. I agree. He's the guy every girl wants to bring home to momma and he's perfect for Alex in so many ways but you can't tell me, while reading a book, that you don't feel a connection to a certain character, right? That if these characters were real (and maybe they were a little older) you would find yourself drawn to a certain type. I'd be having an internal battle over Seth and Caleb.<br /><br />This book was just . . . I read it slow because I wanted to savor it. I read this series so quick (in a week, including the novellas) and it just came and went too fast for my liking. So I slowed down, let it settle in and then read some more, let that sink in and so forth. Once I got to a certain point I couldn't put it down, though. So many emotions but one thing I can say without spoiling it was that this was a fantastic way to end a series. Maybe not the best I've read but it was damn good. I had many tears fall but overall, I was really happy with everything and everyone. Well . . . mostly everyone.<br /><br />You know it's a good series when you suffer one of those book hangovers. You're staring at your bookshelves with all those books that need to read but you just can't find one. What you want to do is pick up the series from the beginning and read it all over again. That's what I want to right now but I won't.<br /><br />So many characters I loved in this series and so many more that I respected so much. The entire group that formed with Alex (including Deacon, Luke, Lea, Olivia, Solos, Marcus, Aiden) - I love them. I really love Apollo, though. He's now become my favorite god because of this series! Hades ain't so bad, either . . . he's a bit of a hot head though! ;)<br /><br />If you want to see a series that is not only amazing but concluded in the way a series should, this is definitely one you want to read. It had many sexy scenes, many, many laughs, many tears, many battles, but lots of kicking ass. I can't praise this series enough and I'm glad I read it. And not having to wait was awesome so now if you haven't started this series, you don't have to wait either. Get out there and read it. I've never laughed so much while reading a series - laughing while reading is good and not common enough so eat it up.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jessica @ Step Into Fictionso much.

B00EP22QKG|5.0|This is so great. I can't even decide which song is my favorite, because I love them all! I'm so glad Joan Jett is back making new music.
B0091W7K6K|4.0|Just a great classic that established the action-thriller genre.  Well written, well presented.  The best car chase-scene ever, as we all know.  I was thrilled to see that Amazon offered this on my Prime streaming and once I found out, I watched instantly - kudos Amazon on a great pick.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Whoo-hoo! Finally the &quot;real&quot; Candy Crush Saga is available on Kindle.  I have been playing on my Iphone but this is so much better. Vibrant Colorado &amp; larger screen make it so enjoyable.  Thx!!!
B00DH4BL4U|3.0|Interesting but very poorly written with no flow. Often seems as though penned by a child. The train of thought of the author seems to jump all over the place and this makes for a very disjointed read, despite the facts and stories being quiet interesting.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was well written and it as good to revisit the people from Time to Kill. Hope he will return to these characters again in the future.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Well, I've struggled with this a bit.  I have probably read my las Patricia Cornwell book, because now they are becoming a bit repetitive in content, though set in different locations.  For some reason, this one bothered me, and I found some of simply impossible to believe.  The main characters that occur over and over in her books seemed a bit different this time, and I think it may be that even to the author they are becoming a bit &#34;worn around the edges.&#34;
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|Okay, so I'm no fan of peta, and this movie definately lost cool points for featuring those peta posters, but this movie is excellent. I've always been against keeping wild animals in captivity- they are WILD, I mean come on! This movie is great for informing people, and is very well put-together. It is deeply saddening however, that it took so much suffering for so long, for a movie as big as this to come out.<br /><br />The biggest thing I learned from this film is this- when people make millions and billions, they will put anyone and anything at risk. Not only was Tili treated horribly beyond words, but the amusement industry put so many lives in danger. And that is pathetic. I think everyone is used to seeing animals get the shaft, but to so willingly throw humans under the bus and not only put them in harm's way, but KNOWINGLY keep information from them, that could have saved their lives and impacted the way they acted- to make them safer? That is unforgivable. I'm not even gonna mention scarring any visitors- children, especially- who were there at any of the times when Tili injured/killed people. How, after the first time, could anyone keep this poor, suffering animal alive just for a buck? How, can you continuously threaten the lives of so many people?<br /><br />This film will not restore your faith in humanity. At. All. It will, however, make you want to do more to end wild animal captivity. I mean, I don't believe in setting domestic pets free or anything crazy like that because they have depended on us for decades and that's just cruel and inhumane (not to mention abandonment... which is against the law), but wild animals should STAY wild. It's bad enough that we are killing the environment, isn't it? Do we have to ruin everything we see?<br /><br />The caption on the cover is excellent- do not capture what you can not control. If only humans would remember that, the world would be in a much better place. Learn some respect for animals, and this will nothappen again.
072325804X|5.0|Can't wait for my daughter to open the whole collection in one on Christmas morning!! You guys were so prompt, efficient, and the book looks great! Thanks so much!
B009AMAGQM|1.0|This is quite possibly the most dull movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole movie, all that was running through my mind was, &#34;what on earth even is this?&#34; &#34;what have I done?&#34; and &#34;why does everyone love this crap?&#34;.<br /><br />I mean... really? Seriously? How do you even watch this? I'm just disappointed in myself for getting caught in the hype- wasn't this supposed to be the &#34;best movie&#34; of some time of the year or something? I am also disappointed in the film industry. Really. Whoever created this, GTFO.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I loved Castleville glad to see a mobile version.<br />Works fine on my 8&quot; Fire and I appreciate Zynga releasing a Kindle app
B00G70K1HY|5.0|The extended cut is an improvement on an already interesting and fun movie. The Wolverine is definitely one of the better comic book films of the past few years!
B00C1040TO|5.0|This tuning app works well and it is a nice addition to have a built in metronome.  I like how the metronome flashes the screen and changes the color while it puts out the rhythm.  You get the visual beat notification as well as the audio beat which you may not hear while you are playing.  On the tuner you can change the wave of the note and also tell the unit to use the note sustain mode.  You can adjust the tone by setting a triangle wave, sine wave, square wave and a saw wave.<br /><br />The microphone in and recording mode doesn’t work on the Kindle Fire as there is no audio input on that device. There is a detailed setting screen that you can use to optimize the app to your needs.  It is well designed and the user interface is easy to learn and use.<br /><br />This is a good app and it is useful for musicians and students although beginners will need a little training to learn how to use it.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|The sequel to one of the best td games out there. I find it regrettable that it is a paid app with rather pricey in-game add-ons (some costing 6.99$ a piece, more than twice what I paid for the game), but I don't regret buying the game in the least.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it. And found myself laughing out loud a lot. I would definitely recommend this for readers aged 13 and up.
B00B19H2KU|4.0|I love to binge on scary movies right around Halloween, and this was one of them in my line up. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever seen, but it fit the bill. At one point, the movie was buffering...meaning it paused right at a really scary-faced moment and I could not get it off that point on my screen... kinda freaked me out... that face was stuck in my mind for a while. Lol. I love &#34;true stories&#34;...adds another level of fear to whole experience. Again, not the best...but not a bad way to give yourself a little chill.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Keep up the good work, I would like to see big game hunting like elk, bear, lion.other than that it is a good game great way to pass time.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|This book was very interesting and well detailed<br />It will keep you on the edge of your seat. I love this book!!!!!
B005KAH7QU|4.0|It was an odd story with some unique cinamatography.  The characters were interesting, especially Hanna.  I kind of thought when it started, that it would be slow and boring, but it sucked me in with engaging characters and excellent acting.  It was pretty violent, but otherwise clean.
1423140605|4.0|I purchased this book for my granddaughter.  She loves reading Rick Riordan's books.  Every year she has to write a report for the summer reading program.  She started out with the &#34;Lost Hero&#34; and is continuing with the series.  This is a great read for anyone who is interested in Greek Mythology or Egyptian Mythology.  I like buying books from Amazon because they have the best prices.
0345803493|5.0|Great book, read the whole series, can't wait to see the movie now, going to take a friend! Thank You
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|After playing the free version of this app it was clear to me that my son really enjoyed the puzzles and was learning from Alphabet Aquarium School. The full app was exactly what I expected. The animation runs smoothly and voice over work is the quality I have come to expect from 22learn educational apps. This app is a great tool to help reinforce the alphabet in your child’s mind or to introduce it to a new learner. Each letter has four unique puzzles that are mostly words that your child will be familiar with and a few interesting vocabulary words to learn (in our case we discussed flowers, specifically Zinnias, one of the words for the letter Z.) The settings menu allows the parent to turn on or off the puzzles you want your child to practice, or in my child’s case after he played through it once I set it so that he could repeat only the animal puzzles as a reward. (He really liked the animal puzzles.) There is also the ability to turn the sound off and on within the app. I found the aquatic animal theme to be adorable, as did my son. He is demonstrating a comfort level with the alphabet that he didn't show until after playing through this app. I feel certain that playing with this educational game is helping him to learn to get ready for pre-k. This app was well worth purchase price, I highly recommend it to parents or anyone who is responsible for a child.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Excellent book, worth the price, got it immediately, will buy from this seller again, makes you a believer, Thank you!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I have bought all the seasons of supernatural, love then all. Very entertaining and it keeps you on the edge of your seat at times
0066620996|5.0|This book is a highly recommended read. It gives key strategies behind some of the most powerful and successful companies. Understanding their strategies helps you to position your company for longevity. It shows you how to either make the cut or fail, holding back no punches.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I really enjoy anything to do with the supernatural, so I was hooked by season one of Supernatural. I have purchased all the seasons that have been released!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|My dyslexic middle schooler prefers this calculator to all other free calculators he has tested. He has tried several. Until we find better this is our choice.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|My love for this series of Supernatural is still strong! Love the suspense and thrill and watching those Winchester boys.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I chose 5 stars be cause I couldn't put it down.  This is one of the great authors.  Thank you, John.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love Supernatual! The Winchesters are great eye candy to watch as they go ghost, demon and witch hunt, very entertaining!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is so smart. Last night I took note at my watercolor class and it was automatically titled &quot;notes from Sumi class&quot;. It was on my calendar. I also like the notebooks and tags.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|I wasn't sure at first but this turned out to be a good one. Funny dialogue and good characters. I would recommend this to a friend.
1451695195|3.0|My husband was dying and I wanted to read this. It arrived , I read it and have loaned it<br />to a friend now.  The book is challenging to nonbelievers - comforting to the terminally ill I would<br />think.
B00GI13VYW|5.0|Love it, can listen to the whole album, every song,  planning on catching the show here in LA in January at the Wiltern.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great fun but can be a little confusing<br />no extra lives given and getting back to game is confusing. have fun
0060935464|5.0|A very good story although written in another time in history.  I bought the book used but what I found as much interesting was a 8th grade student had looked up words she did not know and wrote the new meaning and some statements she wrote were funny. Really added to the book
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook does not keep your activities on it secret. Do not use this website if you value your privacy. EOL
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This book hit the nail on the head with humor.  Tackling the topic of Asperberger's Syndrome could have been a daunting task; but, the author was both sensitive and accurate to the unique characteristics.  I have a grandson with Asperberger's and found the story very uplifting.  Highly recommend this book of self discovery.
B00BMNM4H6|1.0|Does not remember your last achieved puzzle. Not worth the time to dowload or memory to store on your tablet/phone.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|lots of action, end was as cheesy as his perfume commercial.  Worth the .99 rental.  Would watch it again if it were free.
B006J420UE|3.0|I had to buy a new one after the first one fried out. After I bought a second motherboard thinking that was what went out. Here's hoping I just happened to have bought a rare defective one. Either way, it was too bad the warranty had already worn out. Now I have a spare motherboard and a burnt out AMD Chip.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Great sci-fi classic!  Love the additional footage which gives even more detail to the story!  Long live auto sentry guns!  Kids, this movie is where all the ideas for cool stuff in most FPS games come from!
B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|Heads up, it's the UK version. That was unexpected. I was expecting the US version, maybe somewhere it says it's the UK version, but whatever.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|I just left the theater.  and Wow! what an incredible ride.  Thus us a very intelligently conceived and well written and presented story.  It is a brilliantly written metaphor of the human condition throughout human history - the few live very well at the expense of the many.  Visually stunning - great CG I, incredible details and non stop action - more than enough to watch again and again and see something new each time.  Impossible to become bored.  No Hollywood cliches here.  Matt Damon is not portrayed as a stereotyped shirtless muscled hero - with his tee shirt still on and the machine parts attached to him over it, he becomes an every-man - he is one of us and we are him as he struggles to survive against impossible circumstances.  No hero riding off into the sunset here.  This is another movie classic that should be experienced on the big screen, to be fully appreciated.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this Spider game. It is challenging, fun, and I win once in awhile.  I would recommend this game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's fun and mildly challenging. Great when ya need to kill a few minutes and ya can't beat the price!
1595825045|1.0|I'm highly disapointed at this, not at the product, but the condition it came in! i had a small tear in the middle bottom of the front cover, and it came without a plastic rap (unlike my legend of Korra one), plus the edges are a little bent giving the impresion someone had already used and abused the book. plus both the back and front cover are uneven with the actual conent in the book almost as if was bend in a weird twisted way. Being a collector of illustration books and comics, i'm very picky at the state of it when it came, if is something i did  then i wouldnt compain, but this is very upseting.<br />for those of you who wants this book and who want it  to be new, i highly recomend another buyer.<br /><br />ps. if the people in charged are readin this, i hope you can get ahold of me and see if you can send me a better copy, if so i will gladly give it the 5 stars it deserves.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Excellent song choices and what a beautiful voice (and lady).  The Songs reveal Susan Boyle's voice talents - range and versatility.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Turns my stupid bedroom TV into an almost-as-smart as my smart TV... TV. Youtube and Netflix work great. The music thing is a little janky but I never listen to music on my TV anyway. Basically you upload all of your music to &#34;google play&#34; and then google decides what you can legitimately play on your TV. Not sure why they didn't just allow you to stream directly to the unit but whatever its freakin $35. Buy it!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Awesome DVD series. I was unable to view on demand, so buying the DVD series was perfect. I highly recommend it.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Really fun little game. Me and my son love it! I mean really who doesn't like putting out fires with a water hose?!? win win!
B00ENFS0F0|5.0|I received Season Five on Blu-Ray yesterday on release date.  As with the previous season releases of TNG, Season Five has proven to be top-notch.  I have obviously not watched it all the way through in less than twenty-four hours, however I have watched the documentaries and one episode from each just to sample disc quality.<br /><br />Many reviews have listed Season Five as less-than-stellar with a few quality standout episodes; I whole-heartedly disagree.  While Seasons Three and Four were top-notch for sure, I feel the the fifth season produced mostly high quality episodes with only a couple &#34;duds.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The Game,&#34; &#34;New Ground,&#34; &#34;Hero Worship,&#34; and &#34;The Perfect Mate&#34; are episodes I used to skip when watching the series on Netflix.  However, the HD transformation makes those episodes fun to watch again.  &#34;Ethics&#34; is also an episode I have a serious problem with.  I feel like the script writer tried to shove a bunch of conservative, twentieth century morals in surrounding Worf's paralysis and wish to end his life.  They made Riker and Crusher downright sanctimonious in the episode, which was atypical of their characters.<br /><br />As mentioned, Season Five had some absolutely stellar episodes.  &#34;Ensign Ro,&#34; &#34;Conundrum,&#34; &#34;Cause and Effect,&#34; &#34;The First Duty,&#34; &#34;Power Play,&#34; &#34;A Matter of Perspective,&#34; &#34;Violations,&#34; &#34;I, Borg,&#34; and &#34;The Outcast,&#34; and &#34;The First Duty&#34; are some that stand out in my mind.  &#34;The Outcast&#34; succeeds on all levels, even surpassing Season Four's &#34;The Host.&#34;  One of the very best episodes of any Star Trek series, &#34;The Inner Light,&#34; is a favorite as well.<br /><br />Not only do we get great character development for the seven main characters, Season Five manages to give some great scenes to important supporting characters, including O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and his new wife Keiko (Rosalind Chao), Ensign Ro (the great Michell Forbes), and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg).<br /><br />The bonus features are fantastic.  Included are the original bonus features transported over from the original DVDs, as well as the 30-second episodic promos for each episode.  These more than anything remind me of watching the show growing up, and I really hope they find all the promos for Deep Space Nine when they begin its HD transformation.  There are brand-new audio commentaries on &#34;Cause and Effect,&#34; &#34;The First Duty,&#34; &#34;I, Borg,&#34; and &#34;The Inner Light.&#34;  Other new bonus features include newly-discovered deleted scenes and a gag reel and a conversation with the main composers of Next Generation's music.  Most enjoyable, though, is the two-part documentary for this season set, 'Requiem: A Remembrance of Star Trek The Next Generation.'  The first part, titled 'The Needs of the Many,' mainly focuses on a 1981 interview given by Gene Roddenberry.  In it he talked about his vision for the future and his hopes for Star Trek.  New interviews with Rick Berman, Ron Moore, and others on the creative team are peppered in around clips from Gene's 1981 interview.  The second part of the documentary is called 'The Needs of the Few,' which mostly features the cast sharing memories of Gene and his death, which is emotional to watch.  There is also a discussion on how the series changed during Season Five.  The addition of Michelle Forbes is discussed.  Colm Meaney is also discussed.  All seven principle cast members are given interview time.<br /><br />As with previous releases the HD transfer is phenomenal.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|A classic album that belongs in every die hard metal fan's collection.  A must own and each track never gets old and clocks many hours in my CD player.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT deserves 5 stars i love this game its soo addictive i have all the characters and it cool love it
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun game but likes to delete my progress multiple times. If you can handle the frustration then the game is worth it. Kind of
B00CATSONE|3.0|It was interesting reading about the life of Tesla and all of his accomplishments. This is a very succinct telling of these things. But then there's this mixture of imagination and intelligence that just doesn't provide a cohesive whole. Parts are good, but the combination doesn't coalesce nicely. Maybe a little more space to more fully flesh out the ideas could have been helpful.
1440503257|5.0|150 golden stars to this cookbook. I purchased this for my girlfriend on her birthday. She loves it so much.
0399255370|5.0|I have been coloring for 60 odd years with many, many, many different crayons. I think we had the big fat crayons when I was in kindergarten, and worked my way down to the slim ones. I would purchase color books and more crayons with my allowance. Over the years with three children and three grandchildren, crayons have been purchased, used, colored, broken thousands of times in my family. Never, ever, have any of my family had to undergo this kind of trauma cited in this book. I have learned a real lesson.<br /><br />Duncan wanting to color opened his crayon box and found letters from each crayon. What a surprise. I have been a whiner, my children gave been whining, as have my grandchildren, but never my crayons. Like Duncan I would stand up and listen to what they say. Good cases one and all. I am so pleased to report that Duncan came up with the perfect solution. I hope we would also, if faced with this problem.<br /><br />Terrific storyline by Drew Daywalt. It sounds to me he has been there, done that. The illustrations by Oliver Jeffers are bright,attractive and so true to his likes. His favorite color is striped! This is a book for every child and adult who reads, or likes to be read to. Grab one, everyone!<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 11-19-13
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has really gotten better each season.  I thought season 1 was OK, but didn't watch season 2 until a year or so later when I was sick at home.  I watched the entire season 2 in one day it was that good.  Season 3 kept it going.  Looking forward to season 4!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game!  Such fun to get from one room to the next.  I can't wait for more rooms to become available.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun but hate having it tied to Facebook. I wish it were easier to earn crowns and the time it takes to make isn't proportionate.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is definitely better than reloaded and you can spend less real money. It's better to use your shotgun if your rifle isn't good enough.
B00CFA222M|5.0|Great movie! Bought this DVD for my kids. But I watched it a few times and I normally don't it was worth watching over and over.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Don Tillman is an unconventional hero.  He is a geneticist with a brilliant mind and a very meticulous, structured approach to all aspects of his life.  As he is methodical in all that he does, it makes perfect sense for him to approach his search for a mate the same way he would any type of science or research project.  He develops an extensive questionnaire designed to find the perfect wife.  Enter Rosie.  She is not a candidate for his wife project but as the story progresses it becomes clear that the two of them could do no better.<br /><br />To date I've only read one other story where a romantic lead has Aspergers/Autism. [[ASIN:0425244466 The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie]] by Jennifer Ashley is one such book, however in that story the hero is aware that he is \\"mad\\" (as he was in an asylum for much for his life). While Don realizes that he often misunderstands emotional and social cues, I don't think he's managed to conclude that he actually has Aspergers despite lecturing on the topic.  This story was a delight to read.  I found myself smiling page after page as I waited for things to finally click for Don and he would realize & acknowledge his feelings for the offbeat but sweet Rosie.  However, in spite of Don's challenges, Rosie also has her own issues and I wanted to shake her a few times too as her hot/cold attitude confused & frustrated Don (and me)!<br /><br />This was a fun, charming story that lends a fresh perspective on the challenges of navigating social and romantic relationships.  The author puts Don in awkward and funny situations but still manages to treat him with the respect and dignity he deserves.  Looking forward to a Part 2 - would love to see Don's approach to \\"The Baby Project\\"! :-)
B003BW0CB6|4.0|It is a good read, but not as good as some of his others that I have read in the past.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this app its very fun., also captivating. very and free. I refommnd everyone. out there looking at this review to watch it n I promise u will enjoy it
030758836X|5.0|This is a great book. I got thoroughly caught up in this book. Flynn builds her story well and makes it quite intriguing.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is realistic!! I like how when you kill an animal it doesnt just fall right there. Some animals stagger,or even trip or do flips. Or if you shoot the animal in its leg, some will limp away making it easier to shoot at! I love this game!! I just wish i knew how to get more hollow point bullets and sports drinks?!?
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|I thought I would never say that Tom Hanks was in any bad movies but this one stinks to high heaven. The first time I watched it I jut thought maybe I just missed something and should see it again to take it all in. NO --- it stinks. Bad writing, poor story, hard to follow or make sense out of it. BIG THUMBS DOWN!
B005SCSL56|5.0|Well written and a beautiful story.  I am an instant fan and cannot wait to read the next book.  WONDERFUL
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This is a new take on an o0ld story and is very well done. Not all that close to the original but well worth the viewing. Bright and attractive cast brings this old story to life.
B00BUT5I84|4.0|This album is stunning. All the songs seem to have an underlying depth that speak to us all. The music is catchy and pleasant to follow, but yet still retains the angsty alternative sound that 30STM has become known for.<br />Up In The Air, Northern Lights, Bright Lights, and The Race, at least in my opinion, are the absolute highlights of the album. There's a very raw feeling to the lyrics that makes it feel like you're getting a glimpse into Jared's very soul as he sings. City of Angels is also beautiful, and feels like a love letter to LA and everything it symbolizes.<br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I still think A Beautiful Lie was by far their best album, and I'm not sure anything can top it. But this one comes very close.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works pretty well.  I haven't figured out how to view content via the chrome browser yet, but I plan to give it a try soon.  Netflix works very easily.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|Good quality way to supplement Netflix! Support is excellent if ever needed and bow with my Windows 8 phone I can take it with me!
B0069UP2PI|4.0|The movie was good in terms of being pretty accurate to describe the events that would take place.  The acting was pretty good as well.  It is a scary prospect all around.  The only part that was so inaccurate it was sad was the length of time that the vaccine became effective in the doctor.  It takes weeks to build up an immunity after a vaccine.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this book!  It was a very easy, quick read.  Captivating and left me wanting to know more about their story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and hope other readers will read this book. I can't wait to see the movie of this. CATCHING FIRE.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was the best book of the series!  I loved it!  I'm looking for another book comparible to this one...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I choose this book because of my heart surgery, and I was trying to relate my adventure with it,I am still currently reading it.<br />so far it is a great book, I am all so a great believer in Christ, But we believe, that through the grace of our lord jesus Christ.
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|Probably one of the best, but least known of Tarantino's films. OK so it has 4 directors/writers. All the rooms are wonderful jaunts into the absurd. If you haven't seen this one you should.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|The major problem I have with &#34;Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth&#34; is the authors tendancy to cherry pick the biblical texts he uses as historical accounts and those used as parable. The only justification given seems to be personal opinion rather than a consistent approach. If you want as good an understanding of the life and times of Jesus, read just about anything written by John Dominic Crossan.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I downloaded this app/game onto my Samsung GS3 and love it -- I was instantly addicted to this app/game and couldn't put it down!!  I even woke up in the middle of the night and kept playing until my phone died before putting it back on the charger. I love the color, the animation, and everything else this app/game entails.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I was hesitant to get it. I used to play the on Facebook but would get annoyed about the fact that once you ran out of the energy you couldn't do anything but just stand there  until you get it back really just didn't make me want to play anymore. I read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try and I am hooked. I just started so I am still learning but so far I am enjoying the game . No more waiting for energy to do the next task ,if you need to do something you can . So far I think it's way better than its predecessor but I do miss my avatar walking around. So far it been really good.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is a lot of fun....very entertaining for lots of ages...only problem I had was some quests wanted me to do certain things and required a certain level. Since I wasn't that level I was kind of unsure how to level my character. Finally I just keep making items and selling them and I levelled.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|It was interesting with a different twist on all the other Superman movies. I enjoyed it. Good cast of stars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good read.  I didn't care for the ending as it left  the reader hanging, maybe a sequel is planned to finiash the story.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Update the game cheese heads, there already 2 updates behind, come on!!!!!!! This is becoming ridiculous!!! Where are the new vehicles and maps!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Totally hooked on the characters and gallows humor (for the most part) right from the start and happy that all that lasted through all seasons. Sorry when Season 5 ended.
B000001FDK|5.0|This looks nice and I can't wait to surprise my mom with this and I can't wait to see her face come this Christmas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's Minecraft.  It's not the PC version, but my whole family has spent countless hours enjoying it, especially when we could all play on the same world.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Fantastic mouse with good grip and tons of programmable buttons. A word of warning though: the middle side button cannot be programmed to a control in a game, you have to assign that button to a key in the software, and then assign the control in game to that key. Same with the buttons near the mouse wheel. The software is also extremely easy to use and you can have two profiles at once. Don't buy this because you think you need 8000 dpi, buy it because it will feel great in your hand, look awesome, and costs a fraction of mice from other brands *cough* razer *cough.
1608838137|4.0|I enjoy this series  so I had to order it. I would have given it a 5 but was not thrilled with the way it ended.
B00E5N8E2O|4.0|After watching the film, I really wanted to buy this album! After I bought it, I decided to listen to the CD, but like most modern CD releases...the mastering turned out pretty bad. I hate to break it to you, but the CD's are just too loud. I then ripped the audio from the DVD, did a little editing on a few songs (to remove bad transitions and/or unnecessary stuff), and voila! I burned the DVD audio to a blank CD after converting the songs to ordinary CD quality, and the newly burned CD's sound much warmer than the ones I bought. In addition to that, I even decided to burn the bonus acoustic set onto my Disc 2, which sounds absolutely wonderful. It's just too bad it's not on the badly mastered CD's. The concert itself is awesome to watch! No words to explain it...just freakin' watch it! Even the acoustic set! This, in overall is one of the greatest live albums along with Led Zeppelin's Celebration Day since I believe Aerosmith's A Little South of Sanity. If you're an audiophile like me, then I would recommend purchasing only the DVD or the Blu-Ray and just rip the audio from there. :D
B005XUC398|5.0|Love it.  It kept me guessing throughout the entire film.  I had no idea what was going to happen next.  This is not your usual Wall St type of drama.
1572707208|5.0|This is a very simple formula for accomplishing more in the time available.  It is told in Brian Tracy's usual straightforward and entertaining way but more importantly it provides easy to follow instructions of what to do to manage time more effectively.  I bought a copy for every member of the lowest performing team I lead and have noticed a distinct improvement in productivity.  They are not world beaters yet but we're getting there.  They also now assist one another and the phrase &#34;eat that frog&#34; is a constant reminder to them to prioritise and just get it done.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It is a fun game. I got hooked on the game the very first time I played it.  It is a fairly easy game so almost any age could play.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|Great book.  I'm a fan of Rework which is the other Jason Fried book on making the work-world more efficient and this one meets the bar.  If you liked Rework you'll like this book too.<br /><br />Contrary to some of the reviews, I found that there were plenty of suggestions for how to implement what he suggests.  There are in fact full sections where he mentions tips.  If you currently work remotely this book might seem basic but for the vast majority of office workers that either do not work work remotely or do so poorly, this book is a great help.  It's also short enough that it makes for a quick read (I suggest the eBook).<br /><br />If you're already sold on the idea of working remotely, move straight to section 3, &#34;How to Collaborate Remotely&#34; and read from then on.<br /><br />Only suggestion for the author/editor is that some of the chapters should be a bit larger.  In particular, &#34;Beware the Dragons&#34; could use more concrete examples and/or references to content outside the book.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|requires different wire/plug in then charger wire - this causes inconvenience and/or dead battery<br />noticed little difference in sound<br />does not automatically turn off<br />light indicating product it is on is hard to see - needs to be brighter and more pronounced<br /><br />I used Velcro to stick amplifier  on back of cell phone
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love these book! It's my third time reading them. They are amazing! Can not wait to see Catching Fire this Thursday.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Saw this version on a huge IMax screen and it was incredible.  Am seeing it live again this December with family and bought a copy of the DVD for them.
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|My book club chose this book. Admittedly, I'm not a Gladwell fan in general, but I'm finding it torture to get through this collection of unrelated anecdotes that he feels add up to social science.
0316044695|5.0|Wonderful read!<br />Highly recommended for anyone who is into real life military stories.<br />Heart touching. Hard to put down! Beautiful writing.
B000000OQF|5.0|Good album from the 80s, some of the bands best work, I don't remember listening to any of their other albums quite so much and the except for a few gems like November Rain, there weren't many hits on their other albums.<br /><br />The best part is, what's on the CD always delivers, I saw GnR live in the 80s and they are really a studio band, in concert I saw Rose kicking sound equipment off stage and give a generally poor performnace.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|After several persistent emails, I remembered to submit my review.  Product has met all my expectations.  The hub is small, so it fits well in the bag with 10&#34; tablet/notebook I carry daily.  Speed is good and build quality seems solid.
B004GJXQ20|2.0|Martin's writing style is possibly one of the most over hyped in the world. His storyline and concepts are obviously well thought out and developed but the manner in which he applies words to them is average, at best. His style is repetitive and lackluster in describing fast paced or action scenes.<br />His stories, though well developed, are sadistic and downright misogynistic. Male-domination based fantasy realms are nothing new or exciting. I suppose you could say he's &#34;making a comment on history&#34; (his whole series being compared to the War of the Roses) but it doesn't read that way. His female characters are at best, powerless and constantly fearing for their lives at the mercy of males (far more often than the male characters) or at worst, subject to abuse, torture, rape and death.<br />It's not the worst book I've ever read (50 Shades takes that honour) but so few people are honest about the writing, having been blinded by the marginally superior TV show, that I was constantly let down.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book. This was the catalyst for helping me overcome depression and a negative mindset. While some people have already conquered this from elsewhere in their life, this book worked so well for me. It deserves 3 1/2 stars for how it was written and the material. Gives you some tips and explains positive thinking, how to do it and why, but it is extremely redundant. I gave it 5 stars for its effectiveness and its impact on me. I have already recommended it and the power. There is a filter of &#34;BS&#34; we should acquire in life. As long as we have it, we can get the best out of anything and we can receive help from different areas. This is one of those areas. It changed my life because the way it was presented worked so well with me. The presentation may not work for others, but if you get the message, it could heavily impact you as well.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Nicely illustrated....buildings and plots start to get pricey after level 9. There is a downside waiting for items to craft and sending heroes on missions. Other than that it is a fun game.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I haven't plaid it yet because my mom wont let me get it but the coments make it look delly fun except for some of the coments
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Little bit smaller than I expected. Be careful when buyin this product I thought that the size was going to be bigger. In general came within a box and with certificate, everything looks normal in the product, but again its small size for the hands of a men.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Loaded this app for my grandson. He doesn't play this too much any longer. I am not sure of the age range.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Great CD.<br /><br />I really liked the CD; good representation of where her songs are going. No issues. Would buy again.
1426308469|5.0|I ordered this for my 2 year old grandson, and he LOVES this book.  The pictures are large and exciting for him to look at.  He wants to read this book everyday, so it was a GREAT purchase!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Work great and seamless for all my HTC One, Nexus 7, iphone 5 and ipad 4.  For watching you tube content.

0307743721|3.0|It was too subtle for my taste in literature. I'm not sure I got everything I was supposed to get.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this game is a good brain workout.  i enjoy playing it and i think it is a lot of fun!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good movie-keeps your attention.  Denzel Washington plays an excellent part in this movie-really a good story line.  Better than I expected.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Missed watching this segment, and so happy that Amazon made it available to me.  This is one of my favorite shows.
B005PK553C|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this season.  Very spooky and creepy.  Watched the entire season in one weekend.  Couldn't put it away.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Although the Extended Edition had less extended scenes than the Lord Of The Rings Extended Editions, this was great! The behind the scenes features are very entertaining. If you've enjoyed the behind the scenes from the Lord of the Rings series, these will not disappoint.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Mcewan's evocative efficient prose makes an improbable story readable, but the attention to detail and final twist make it truly enjoyable!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Although the topic was disturbing, it was gently handled. The characters were written in a way that made me care about some and despise others - as the author intended. The resolution of the two interwoven stories was heart warming.
B003WUYR6I|4.0|Connelly brings two of his mainstay characters - Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller- together in this riveting tale that places our beloved Lincoln Lawyer on the prosecutor's side of the aisle in this courtroom drama.  There's enough suspense to keep one reading into the wee hours, all while the main characters grow more likeable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Omg this book was amazing just like the first two!!! Very much love the way the author kept me so interested!!! Amazing author will definitely be reading more books by the author!!!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I cried for so long, even though it was very heart breaking, I loved it! But be prepared  to cry
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston and Child's wonderful creations never disappoint. Half the fun is absorbing the seemingly endless collection of interesting facts laced throughout the stories.  The true joy, however, is once again sharing an adventure with the stoic Agent Pendergast and his associates.  Highly recommended for your winter reading pleasure.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I find it interesting individuals posting things like &#34;weak&#34; or &#34;their first albums were better&#34; etc....This album has it all....it has hard core heavy metal....it has a rap classic remix which is great....it even has a slow song or two....it is no different than there first two albums in terms of raw hardcore metal.  I have seen these guys 2x in the last 3 years live.  They seem to blow everyone else away especially live.  Considering they opened up for POD, Chevelle, Slash, Korn, Staind, Shinedown and a few others, it was FFDP who stole the show.....so, for all the doubters...get ready....these guys are Heavy Metal Hardcore American Patriots....nothing else compares.
0060187557|1.0|The opening attack on a Nimitz class carrier (the first, and last, time a carrier of any class appears in the book) is sort of believable, especially given the usual literary license and benefit of the doubt a reader is inclined to bring to the beginning of a book he hopes to enjoy.  But that willingness to suspend disbelief is soon abused, as apparently there is only man in the whole US Navy who has any doubts about the &#34;accident&#34;.  Really?  Only our hero has even the slightest knowledge of nuclear weapons?  It's hard to believe.<br /><br />And it soon gets harder.  Our hero crosses the Atlantic to confer with the British, who, to a man, disbelieved the accident theory within minutes of hearing the news. Something it took the brilliance of our hero to get the US President, CNO, JC, CIA etc. to even consider.  Sigh.<br /><br />But worse is to come.  Our hero develops the theory that the rogue submarine made an underwater transit of the Bosporus, and the US President demands a trial proving it can be done before he'll buy into the hero's search for the rogue submarine.  Naturally the only available submarine for this demonstration is a British boat, so we get the US President insisting on a British submarine making a highly dangerous and illegal cruise through an Allied nations waters, risking the lives of all concerned, before he'll authorize action?  This plot twist seems to serve no purpose other than maybe a tense scene in the hoped for movie.  And &#34;maybe tense&#34; because in the book there are whole chapters leading up to it, then only a couple of pages of considerably less than tense writing.<br /><br />And could it still get worse?  Well yes.  The surprise ending is so obvious, and again, not tense, that the author apparently felt obligated to tack on another chapter with an ending that at least dispenses with the threat that he might reuse the villain in another book.  We can be grateful for that!<br /><br />Absurd plot.  Paper thin caricatures (characters would be an exaggeration).  Lousy writing.  &#34;Technical&#34; details that read like they were lifted verbatim from Janes....  And all of it overlaid with a heavy handed &#34;political&#34; message.  Give this one a miss.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Pretty challenging game. Various modes to choose from. Good for all ages. Plus it was free and no ads. Awesome
0316055433|4.0|Don’t let the size and weight of Donna Tartt’s 771 page novel, The Goldfinch, put you off.  My first reaction was “Oh Lord, how will I ever hold this, much less read it?” until I discovered that this novel does not need to be pried open page by page, but actually falls open to whatever page you might be reading. Unless you are a discus thrower, however, don’t try to hold and read this book, prop it up on something sturdy and let unravel itself.<br />That said, the book’s explosive opening – the terrorist bombing of a New York City museum—sucked me into the story. Carel Fabritius’ masterpiece, The Goldfinch, survives the blast (as it did in 1654 when a gunpowder factory next to the artist’s studio, exploded, killing the artist.  Also surviving is a thirteen year old boy,Theo, whose mother dies in the explosion. Theo awakens from the concussive power of the bombing buried in debris along with an old man who points to the dust-covered painting and pleads with Theo to save it. Before dying, he gives Theo a ring and babbles a name and tells him to ring the green bell. What begins as a surreal journey from devastation and loss, gathers momentum as Tartt thrusts us into future, pursuing Toby and the painting through years of suspense, terror and heartache.<br />While I'd have liked to read The Goldfinch straight through, it’s size demanded I stop so more often than I wished. Tartt's eclectic cast of characters leap from page to life: Hobie, the gentle restorer of antique furniture under whose tutelage Toby learns the trade; Toby’s brilliant but gambling addicted father who drags him to Las Vegas where Toby befriends Boris--a Russian teen whose presence throughout much of the book drove me nuts with his unbridled euphoric, eccentric, and peripatetic personality. And then there’s the painting, both treasure and tyrant that drives the story to its violent yet satisfying conclusion.<br />The book was at least 100 pages too long and I had more than my fill of drug and alcohol abuse running rampant throughout the book  -- from Las Vegas onward. Would I read it again? Perhaps? It’s an amazing, complex, plausible, and gripping and wondrously written hulk of a novel. I wonder if you feel the same way.fill of drug and alcohol abuse running rampant throughout the book  -- from Las Vegas onward. Would I read it again? Perhaps?

B00280LYHS|5.0|Really fun next chapter of the Percy Jackson series. A little darker than the ones before, but still all your favorite people and an entertaining read.
0345533666|3.0|The subject matter didn't appeal to me and there was no definitive ending. The only word I can think of about the book is that it was quirky.
0385344228|3.0|Worth a read, but disappointing that he did not further explain or explore Reactive Attachment Disorder and the role that illness played.
B001MM28JG|5.0|It is a great spoof on Star Trek's original series, and Next Generation, which I enjoyed years ago. There isn't a lot of profound thought here, but it's a lot of fun to watch.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I do have  to say that I tried to read this book four times before I really got into it. I started to read it when my power went out, I couldn't see my paper back and my kindle was fully charged so I started to read The Maze Runner. I read 130 pages just in the first day! This book was a great way to pass the time! Once I got into it I LOVED IT!!!!! I couldn't put it down!
B008602KQI|5.0|Engaging  film rendition of the popular book.  Some of the back story was lost in translation to screen, and reading the book before viewing the movie is time well spent if you want a good understanding of what is happening to these young people and their communities. The main characters and story are well-developed and certainly evolve as the film rolls. The book and the film both have an interesting take on the normalization of violence and the cost of complacency when faced with tyranny.
030758836X|2.0|I just DO NOT LIKE IT.  Too stupid.  It could have been SO MUCH better.  I liked her other books.
B001L5YW9I|3.0|I really enjoyed The Last of the Mohicans when I watched it in the 90's. This version has a different musical score that might be okay, if only the original theatrical version of the film was not such a great marriage of music and story. And so, 3 stars and I will find the original theatrical cut, if it takes a long, long time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|AMAZING! This book was great and I'm excited to read the next one! I'm seeing the movie on Friday then can't wait for the next one to come out
6304698542|5.0|Not being a die-hard fan of Minelli,  I have avoided seeing this film for many years but I was pleasantly surprised  by her fine performance.  In fact, her musical performance is almost too good for the 'struggling' character she portrays.  Any reputable producer would have snapped her out of the rather sleazy surroundings of the 'Kit Kat' Club and featured her in a first-rate club or theatre.  Now, the girls of the chorus ... they are bad (but good) and look like what you would have seen in the venue and  would have been a little more appropriate for 'Chicago' (another Kander and Ebb musical) without all that film's 'glitter'.  Fosse, a rather frantic director, is almost placid here compared to Marshall's direction of 'Chicago' and the movement from story to club is handled nicely.  I don't know what the movies have against Kander and Ebb but once again, as in 'Chicago', the musical score has been cut.  Since it is a 'musical', more of the music would have been nice perhaps in a 'road show' version a la 'Oklahoma' and 'Carousel'.  In this two hour version, the plot has also been trimmed but that's a little more understandable,  since a film audience would probably only take so much of what the Nazis imposed on Germany,  on top of the rather down-beat story.  Joel Grey, as the emcee is outstanding. The rest of the cast is very good too.  I haven't watched the special features about the making of the picture and the excellent re-creation of Berlin in the 1930's on the other side of the disc but if it's the same quality as the film. it should be fine.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Sometimes you run across a book that captures your mind and simply won't let go until you've finished it. This is one of those books. Plenty of excitement, thoughtfulness, and darkness here. I loved this book!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It needs an SDK to work on for a start. More app support! Only supports a few big time apps such as Netflix and Youtube
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Damian Stevenson has done it again, I thought the first book in the Ian Fleming series was good but I think this one is even better. Operation Parsifal is a cut above similar books in this genre for sure. Wolfgang Krupp is a brilliantly drawn villain, you can't help but root for secret agent 17F. Non-stop suspense, action/adventure. Leading up to a very chilling ending that even i didn't see coming.<br /><br />I loved seeing another side to Ian Fleming's character in this book when he moves in with his love interest Anne O'Neill.<br />Can Fleming track down the underground society, called Parsifal run by Krupp.<br /><br />&#34;A License To Kill&#34; is also A Licence to Thrill. If you love Bond, give this a read. It's a diamond of a read.

B0069JBKHI|3.0|I have been using this product for almost 8 months. I like the idea but the product is not ready for primetime yet. It has about 8 to 25 second delay. This is not bad at all. It does however depends on Withings servers. So if the server is down you are SOL. It has happened to me once so far so I had to go buy a cheap voice only monitor from Target. Otherwise it is great product.<br />I like all of the features it has. The lullaby, night light with different colors and zoom. It all works as advertised. It does work from cellular data as well so if you are out for dinner and want to see if your baby was tucked in by the babysitter, you can!<br />Customer service however is terrible. No phone number, or atleast I have not found it yet. Only email. And they do not reply for at least a week. My monitor can no longer shutdown so it is on all the time. I sent in a request via their web help feature and it is been 6 days and there is no response.<br />In short the product is great. It does what it says, but should not use it unless you have a backup to monitor the baby.
030758836X|1.0|I had to force myself to finish this book.  Is this a modern version of &#34;No Exit&#34;?  Is the author telling the reader that the world is peopled with sociopathic, narcissists who manipulate and betray others for their own pleasure?  Hey, guess what?  I knew that already.  There was not one fully drawn well integrated character in this work (perhaps GO was the only sympathic human being that could be identified). Never again for this author.  Wish I could get a refund.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  I like strategy games.  This game holds your attention.  I just wish you could have more lives quicker.  I am sure it is to get you to spend money.  Which i find hard not to.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|I watched the whole thing but I regret it. The 1978 original is so much better than this one. The original was fun, had charisma, charm and humor -- traits this movie is wholly lacking. Ugh, what has happened to movies???
B0084TWN9K|3.0|Even though it is very well written, I found the aloof repetition of missed relationship to be tedious after a while.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The narrative is interesting. The obvious parallels between the teen and the old lady are touched on, but never fully explored.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|If you love flowers as I do and love a good story, this is a book you should read. Victoria Jones is someone I could not comprehend in the beginning of the story yet as I read farther along I felt drawn into her fears and related and reveled in her growth. I think I will have to change a lot of the flowers and plants that grow in my garden...
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Considered one of the two best albums by Van Halen, the other being Fair Warning, it doesn't dissapoint.  Short, tight, and amazing... high energy by Dave and dependably amazing Eddie Van Halen guitar solos.  Loss of Control showcases with fast choppy guitar and lyrics.  Not to mention the rest of the album around it.  If you love albums as a form this is a must have for any lover of classic music, this one will keep on rockin forever!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say...the three books I read through in no time.  I believe this story was so evolved because of the characters and Christian's childhood.  If you look into the childhood and sadness of his youth, you can't help but fall in love with him.  He is remarkable in his achievements and overwhelming in his love for Anna.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Overall I like it. It's easy to use and just different enough from the Facebook version to be new enough for me.
B00G32OER4|3.0|This is a pretty good thrill picture for those who are not regular viewers of horror/thrillers.  The acting was very good, and the videography convincing. However, it was almost too predictable.  Still I would recommend it.
B007N31YH0|5.0|A movie we have seen before, but it is a classic to us. Owning the DVDE means we can watch it again and again.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was beyond intriguing. Every chapter left you on your seat begging for more. Anyone who enjoys fantasy, mystery and a little bit of romance will find this to die for.
B002WN35DC|5.0|El Principito is a classic book, it is incredible inspirational. I love this book since I was a little girl
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Pretty fun shooter. Cool mission variety, weapons, and levels to play with. Amidst it all is information about one of the most influential wars in history. Glu does it yet again!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game gives me lots of fun play almost everyday keep moving forward.to unlock the heroes and dragons like solving a mystery have fun I do:)
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|But be prepared to spend some money or you will be frustrated by how long everything takes. Graphic s are decent, entertaining story line.
B00GKS2HN4|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I didn't have to check the cheats until the very end.  it was not too hard and not too east so it kept me in the game tip the end.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I am a picky Sci-Fi lover. This movie was panned. Why?<br /><br />I know that the reviews aggregated by RottenTomatoes point to the 'trite' plot, though I think that's part of the brilliance. If you only pay attention for the first hour, you think that it's trite and unoriginal. If you keep watching, though, there are factors that come into play that you probably didn't expect at all. It becomes pretty interesting.<br /><br />Additionally, the design is really quite cool, the photography is gorgeous, and Jamie Lannister and Maverick are in it shooting guns and stuff.<br /><br />Yeah, there are a couple gaps in the plot, so it doesn't get five stars. However, I think that the purpose of Sci-Fi movies is to propose alternate realities and juxtapose them to what we know now, highlighting universal human traits and flaws or strengths within society. It does an alright job here and the visuals are enough to keep it interesting when the pacing slows down a bit.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This was a very good, typical John Grisham novel. It was good to bring back the memories from &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I put off reading this for awhile because I thought it would be a feminist manifesto. I WAS SO WRONG. This book is a wake up call for women AND men and it is gently written yet pointed and direct. I am very glad I decided to finally read this book, it has changed my perspective on several things and enlightened me on many others. As a woman in corporate, I will now do some things differently.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this app. It is fun and adicting! I dont like that they only give you five lives though.
B00BSB2AE4|2.0|Author Allie Brosh has an excellent blog by the same name.  She is a talented artist and her posts have historically been either wildly hilarious, or heartbreakingly touching - or both. This book is a compilation of some of her best blog entries, plus some extra material.  It was a pleasure to read, though the content is much funnier and seems to fit better when read online in the blog format.  She posts to her blog infrequently, which is part of the reason it is so popular - she is good at drawing readers in and leaving them hanging on the edge of a cliff!  Especially with her posts about her personal experience with depression.  You just don't get the same experience reading the book.  I am a huge fan and loyal follower of her blog, and would have bought her book in any case, just to support her.  But you COULD save your money and click on [...] instead.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app that allows me to carry my books across all my computers and devices rather easily! Best app out there to me!
B00ALCBTWU|4.0|Before watching this movie, one must understand that this movie is purely fantasy. It's based on a popular computer game. Forget about those critiques whining about historical accuracy. If you want a historical movie, watch Band of Brothers or The Pacific, The Longest Day, Tora Tora Tora... The movie is actually better than I expected. I thought it was some cheap low budget movie but it wasn't, it was pretty decent. The actors are alright, not bad at all. Although as I mentioned the story was purely fantasy, a couple of &#34;bad&#34; things I can comment about were the WW2 German tank they used in the movie. It looked like a M41 Walker Bulldog modified into a German Tiger or Panzer III but it turned out to be funny looking like to be a midget M1 Abrams...LOL. Also one of the German Officer supposed to be in the Army but he wore some sort of Luftwaffe pilot badge which belonged to the air force but I didn't bother look at it closely because it's technically fantasy anyway. I like the movie. Watch it with an open mind.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I truly enjoy Mahjong, this game is challenging and mind boggling. Gives me something to do during down time. Try it, I'm sure you'll love playing.

B00A8ECU24|1.0|Not my order,  Didn't receive it or order it and never will so cannot rate it  - gave it lowest star because I so dislike My Little Pony but to be fair I didn't see the product.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very good game. It took a while for Amazon to put it up. After level 35 you have to start paying. Overall it's a great app.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It's the crappy &#34;new&#34; versions. Even after I explicitly asked to ensure that it was the original release (And was assured that it was)<br /><br />On the plus side, they returned the opened DVD set.<br /><br />It's the remake. Han doesn't shoot first in this one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very happy with my purchase!  I'm a low-tech, senior lady, and had no problem installing and running the Comcast Media Player.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I love Will Smith as an actor as well as his son. To me it was a box office hit.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|It's a great game except for the control system.  You tap where want to go and who you want to attack, but if you're trying to attack something and you accidentally miss.......well then you have a problem. Also when you throw the hammer you have to tap with two fingers, but sometimes I'm running away and since I'm tapping so fast, it makes me throw my hammer instead! Otherwise, a great game. It's more of a war game than a superhero game.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|This is a great to remember a great series.  The details are awsome and well worth the price. Buy It.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loads of time out of my day has been wasted on this game.  Definitely recommend you get addicted to it also.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|I liked the look of the jacket and the zip around feature. Unfortunately it did not fit the Kindle Fire HD as stated. Tried two of them and could not zip it up. The Kindle Fire HD was just a hair too big for the jacket.

B00DWV3NM6|5.0|I love it, design-wise its a black-red scheme and with a mat black back plate.<br />Performance-wise its one of the best of all 780s.<br />Its great and now with the 180$ discount, its better than anything (performance per $)
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a good game I would recommend it to people of all ages because it is a nice little game and you will probably like it
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|It has always felt good to cheer for the underdog so it is even better to know why they, in fact, have an advantage.  Thanks to Mr. Gladwell for encouraging a new perspective and providing hope for those predicted &#34;also-rans&#34;, who in reality may actually be winners.
B000I0QK74|5.0|James Taylor croons his way through an excellent Christmas set.  I listen to this CD over and over and never grow weary of hearing the same music.

B00FLNRN06|5.0|This was wonderful and hilarious. i'm still laughing. Don't hesitate to buy it's the best movie since &#34;The Heat&#34;… .
076115728X|5.0|Definitely one of our favorite children's books! It has a great message about creativity that is often skimped in our education system today.<br /><br />I met the author (Barney) at a conference in NY a couple years ago and was immediately impressed with his passion for and excitement around this book. After reading through a copy at that time, I was instantly sold. I highly recommend this book for any child.
B002PXFMUI|5.0|A landmark in electronic music, this album is creepy. And haunting. And just plain awesome. Retro and futuristic at the same time, this album is a must for those that love electronic sounds and music.
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Really wonderful acting from Pheonix but too long and too slow and boring.  I was really looking forward to this film from one of my favorite directors. As with There Will Be Blood, he lingers on his actors and on scenes way too long in lieu of tight well edited story telling. It's self indulgent, and self indulgence is a director's cardinal sin.
B00FRYD6XC|5.0|This is an AMAZING remix and remaster of an already great album. For 10 years I wondered what this album would sound like cleaned up with todays technology. And now I do. I would definitely pick this album up if you're a fan of American melodic death metal or a Lamb Of God fan or a Devin Townsend fan. His superb producing touch has made this my favorite album of theirs. Metal lives on!
B00G4U7TO0|5.0|I am an old folk music fan, and this album presents a fresh take on some old favorites, as well as some I never heard before. The voices and arrangements are delightful. I can hardly wait for the film's release

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|&#34;Naturally, the books and research papers described the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome, and I formed a provisional conclusion that most of these were simply variations in human brain function that had been inappropriately medicalized because they did not fit social norms - constructed social norms - that reflected the most common human configurations rather than the full range.&#34;<br /><br />I was hooked after I read this... Don is researching Asperger's and comes to the above conclusion. YES!! I'm am a wholehearted believer that Asperger's and autism are extremely over-diagnosed simply because a child is different and not considered the social norm... I believe their difference should be celebrated.<br /><br />Ok.. back to the book.<br /><br />The Rosie Project was is about Don Tillman, professor of genetics at a prestigious university, who is very socially awkward but actually very charismatic. He starts the Wife Project, and in the middle happens to meet Rosie who breaks every rule he has for his &#34;suitable mate&#34;. Rosie teaches him to give up some of his OCD-ness and learn how to have fun. This story about their adventures is pretty stinking hilarious and just oh-so-cute.<br /><br />I read some reviews that said the main character reminded them of Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. It's true... in the greatest way possible. I also read some reviews that harped on the fact that the book is full of stereotypes, but I felt that it really aimed at breaking the stereotypes that people believe about Asperger's. They're just people too.<br /><br />If you like quirky books and have a slightly nerdy side, or if you just like sweet love stories, then this book is for you. The only negative thing I have to say about the book is that the ending was a little lacking. I wish it had been expanded on and a little more emotional - it's what kept me from giving the book a 5-star rating - but it still wrapped everything up nicely, so I can't complain.<br /><br />Plus, there's going to be a SEQUEL!!!! I'm sure it will complete the story and hopefully add some emotion to the current ending. I'm going to be waiting on the edge of my seat.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have adobe reader on all my computers and am happy that I now have it on my Kindle - really helpful
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was the first book I read by Neil Gaiman. The first time I picked it up, I couldn't stand the juvenile nature. But then I came to the conclusion that the narrator is a 7 year old, so I should give it another chance. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a beautifully written, extremely imaginative story about a little boy who happens upon very interesting circumstances surrounding his neighbors down the lane. He is a very lonely boy who becomes friends with Letty, and his life suddenly becomes filled with somewhat scary circumstances, but mostly adventure.<br /><br />Unlike some other reviews I've read, I would not consider this a thriller/horror story. The level of horror is equal to that of the wicked witch in Snow White. It's just the typical villain vs. magic that would be suitable for children to read.<br /><br />After I finished reading this book, I really considered it a children's book (minus the one adults kissing/taking clothes off scene), but then I realized that it is written to portray the overall theme of adults learning to embrace their inner child and live life more open minded.<br /><br />This book is very nostalgic, making you recall your own childhood and how so many circumstances seem larger than life. It makes you remember the magic of every day life. It is full of magical creatures: a flea/villain who travels by wormhole in a foot, varmints who are birds that keep the world &#34;clean&#34;, fabric that comes to life, women who never age, an ocean that teaches you the secrets of life. It is simple, short, and sweet. The ending leaves you wondering what really happened (by way of saying that everyone remembers differently).<br /><br />The theme of how memories change throughout your life is what really stuck out to me. This book really does make you reflect on memories and takes you back to a perhaps simpler but at the same time extremely complicated thoughts that surround childhood. I find myself longing to do something childish and adventurous like making a fort, or going to mine and my brother and sister's &#34;canyon&#34; - which if I every went back to, I'm sure would end up being a 4 foot deep trench.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I would read this book again, but Neil Gaiman is one of the most imaginative writers that I have read recently. I will definitely give some of his other books a try.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Whenever I enjoy a book, I read it tantalizingly slow. So I am not yet finished this one but I have been recommending it to my friends.
1439153663|2.0|I had such high hopes for The Kitchen House. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe it's because I'm from the South and know that all stereotypes are not true. Either way, I was so extremely disappointed with this book. After finishing, I still can't really decide if I even liked it or not.<br /><br />Basically, every single Old South cliche that there has ever been was covered. The good slave master, the evil slave master, masters raping slaves, weeny wives who get depressed and withdrawn, children who are neglected, husbands beating wives.... blah, blah, blah. This would be ok and would still make a good story if there really had been a story. There was not much development, and the story just ended. Also, there was a severe lack of dialogue.<br /><br />I would not consider this book a literary masterpiece or a piece that &#34;does important work&#34; as proclaimed on the cover. The story was well written and entertaining at times, but it is not a story that I would recommend or care to read again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it and so easy to set up and use. You just take it out of the box, plug it in and then use Chrome to search and cast to your TV!! so simple and I am not a techy.
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|Eleanor & Park is a nostalgic tale of first love. You have your classic messed-up stubborn girl who won't open up because of all the hurt in her life (from her family), and you have the boy who just wants to know her and make it all better. Their story switches back and forth from Park's to Eleanor's point of view and is told in a quirky way to make you remember all the small and overwhelming feelings you had when you first started liking boys/girls... Park helps Eleanor escape from her family, and Eleanor teaches Park how to accept himself.<br /><br />I loved the beginning of the book. It was spunky from the moment that Eleanor walked onto the bus with her patched jeans and crazy things hanging in her hair. And how she didn't care but really she did. I loved hearing about them sharing comic books and being scared to actually talk to each other. There was a great tension that was cute until about half way through.<br /><br />Then I didn't like the book anymore after their first love feelings turned to obssession. I mean... weird obsessed for how old they were- 16. A lot of the feelings/thoughts they were having would be more understandable if they were 12 or 13, which to me is around the age when you first start noticing the opposite sex.<br /><br />The end had a good twist that really got me interested again, but then just kind of ended. However, with Park being a phenomenal, I mean upstandingly phenomenal guy.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this is just an ok book. If you like cheesy, can't-think-about-anything-else young love stories, then go for it. If not, you'll probably just get annoyed half way through like me.
0062124293|1.0|How To Be a Woman by Caitlin Moran is by far the most inappropriate book I have ever read. I can honestly say that had it not been for a class, I would have never finished this book. How To Be a Woman was completely vulgar and full of bathroom humor that I was unable to connect with. I kept thinking it would get better (and it would for a few pages, but then turned right back around), but overall this book was a huge disappointment for me. I think this book does a disservice to women everywhere by suggesting that they too should watch porn (the most un-feminist form of entertainment ever!) and call their vagina the C-word. I found this book to be completely shallow and even when it did stumble on to a topic I was pleased with, she found a way to make it raunchy and inaccessible.  The chapter that I thought would most apply to this course was “Models and What we Do with Them”. It ended up being more like a drawn out conversation with the drunk girl who comes to the bar alone. No one really knows what to do with her and her ramblings but she just wont stop talking. This whole book felt like a long drawn out conversation at a high school reunion. There was no depth and the person is just trying to shock you with some impressive story.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|You know how the mood of some books rub off on you? This one did that to me, but in a not so great way. There's just so much loss and freaking sadness. I was quiet and sad for two days after I finished it. I may be weird... but my mood is always affected by the books I'm reading.<br /><br />This is the story of Adeline and Emmeline Angelfield, two very unique twins, told from the point of view of Vida Winter (a well-known and secretive writer on her death bed). The twins and their family live a secluded life and are an eerie mystery until now. It is well known that no one knows the truth about Vida Winter's life, and she has chosen Margaret Lea (also a twin) as the author of her story.<br /><br />Throughout the entire book, the point of view switches between Vida and Margaret. You come to understand the story through Vida, and you come to understand Vida's true nature through Margaret. This story is beautifully crafted. Diane Setterfield intricately weaves words and creates an ominous tone that I love. You really come to see the beauty of reading and stories to connect people.<br /><br />I was really engrossed at the beginning of the story. It starts off with just the right amount of delicious creep. Then it just kept getting sad, and distraught, and then almost hopeless. It slowed down some, and then picked back up after the twist at the end. I definitely didn't see the twist coming, it was so out of the blue that it felt disconnected.<br /><br />The story centers on the bond of family and the ability to let go. It is beautifully tied up at the end (but in a sad way...)
B003VANOFY|2.0|They make a constant popping noise that is impossible to get rid of. I've tried everything from changing the wi-fi channels of my other devices to using older drivers, nothing solves the problem. The noise is especially noticeable when you're listening to music, although I did notice it a lot when playing Diablo 3...<br /><br />I'm going to try and get them replaced and see if it's an issue with the pair I got, but judging from the numerous complaints and forum posts on the topic, I doubt that will make a difference. Oh well, we'll see.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Eleanor & Park is a nostalgic tale of first love.

I loved hearing about them sharing comic books and being scared to actually talk to each other. There was a great tension that was cute until about half way through.<br /><br />This book is phenomenal.. I mean freaking AMAZING. Everyone should read it. Even if you aren't super outdoorsy and could never see yourself backpacking across 3 states, it still has a great message.<br /><br />As for me, I've always loved to explore the outdoors. I've actually never gone full on backpacking though. This book really made me long to get away from life and just be in nature for at least a week - or at least go camping in some cold weather... although, that's not so easy in Hawaii.<br /><br />The story starts off with the explanation of Cheryl Strayed's whole downward spiral after her mother died and how it led her to the Pacific Crest Trail. I'm not going to lie, the first chapter is extremely depressing, especially for anyone close to their mom. It honestly did not give me high hopes for the rest of the book. But the story picks up in the next chapter once she is on the PCT, and the adventure begins.<br /><br />There are stories of all the awesome people she meets and all the miles she walked alone. There are stories of kindness from strangers. There are stories of beautiful nature experienced in the most serene places. Can you imagine walking thousands of miles by yourself, not knowing what you will run into? Talk about flying by the seat of your pants. Sounds like the ultimate adventure to me. Cheryl Strayed really made me feel like I could if I wanted to.<br /><br />Mostly, this book is a discovery of self. The author believed that she would leave her life and just be alone in the woods for 3 months to contemplate her life, cry, and get over it. She actually was only able to think about her aching feet and body at first, then was just quiet with nature. What she found instead was the strength within herself that she didn't know she had - to remember her hard times and still be able to live.<br /><br />This is a strength that we all have if we only know how to find it. This was truly an inspiring and entertaining story that I could definitely go read again right now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|RIGHT of the bat, I enjoyed the graphics. They're so vivid, realistic, and clear. The game play is a bit slow for my taste but, overall, it's a wonderful and enjoyable for horse lovers like myself!:-)
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Agatha Christie is truly the Queen of Mystery like the cover claims. This was my first read by her. I can definitely say there will be many more.<br /><br />When I finished And Then There Were None, I had such a satisfied, childish grin on my face. I'm still baffled. Throughout the book, I thought I had it figured out about 5 different times. This story literally keeps you guessing until the very end. It was amazing.<br /><br />Agatha Christie's writing is so clever and criptic. I was so entertained for the entire book. I love her style. I feel like a kid reading Nancy Drew. Why have I never read Agatha Christie before?
B00FPH6A70|3.0|I think this movie would have benefitted from less screaming.  My eardrums most certainly would have.  At least someone tried to make a thrilled without a ton of gore for once.
1416550550|5.0|The Forgotten Garden was so amazing, so refreshing. The characters had so much life. The story switched back and forth between time periods but was not difficult to follow at all. It was a steady unfolding of hinting of events and then revealing the whole story. It captured my attention for the entire book. There were never any times where the book was lagging or where I wished it would hurry and get to the point - which happens all to often. Kate Morton even includes some of the fairy tales that are in the book that the Forgotten Garden is centered around, and they were incredible. There is so much symbolism in this book that really makes you think. This book is so rich in detail. I believe I could read it several more times and keep discovering small nuances. Kate Morton is now, without a doubt one, of my favorite writers. Her style mimics a classic but keeps you entertained. She adds suspense little by little with perfection. I will definitely be reading more of her books. This is the book that I will be comparing historical family secrets fiction to for years to come.

1451624468|5.0|This book  is a thought changer !!!<br />First of all, It gives you a fantastic history on all the scientific/astrophysic discoveries of the last 120 years( from about Einstein onwards, through Hubble and now to Higgs).... the sort of information you wished you'd learnt at school but were never properly told...explained simply , it makes science exciting...once that sinks in you start to realise what a very tiny part of the universe we are in ..and also how amazing the behaviour of galaxies are....Finally towards the end of the book, you get ideas as to how our universe could have formed, as the type of universe we live in is one that  fits the pattern of  certain circumtances taking place....
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a great game. The graphics are good and it is better than the original castleville. Every one should play this game. I would recommend this game to any one.
B0052OWGYW|3.0|Jason was good as the mechanic but Charles Bronson was better, i enjoyed the film but the original is better; but the special effects and pyrotecnics are the bomb good movie but not the best.
B007N3206E|5.0|A finely crafted cinematic experience.  Scorcese's cinematic vision is once again masterfully framed by two powerful and memorable performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|I love this this is the 3 one I have can't get enough should have been made for TV like other films can't wait for the next one .
B005FDW7AI|5.0|Intelligent, mystical, and shows the good in human nature. I love the message that &#34;all girls are princesses.&#34;  Worth watching repeatedly for children and adults.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|Great movie love the story as well as the acting awaiting the next one don't miss out,  you won't be disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Compared to the other two books, this one fell way short.  Story line boring, no action, very hard to stay interested.
B006885FZI|5.0|Well worth the price good action, special effects and the story of John Basilone was well played buy the actors felt if you were there, and I am a former U.S. Marine Veteran just not ww2 hahaha buy it see it you'll want to go out a slap a jap for the good ole usa no offense but those were the times.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Too unhappy for my taste but over all a good tale. Held my interest for the most part. Kept me guessing.
B001I45UFC|4.0|Lovely tale filled with sweetness. I particularly enjoyed spending time with Mr and Mrs Beaver and of course with Aslan. Of the children my favorite was Lucy. My second favorite was Edmund. If I were to offer any criticism I would say that the story ended a bit abruptly.
030758836X|3.0|Mystery was intriguing, but most of the characters were unsympathetic.  I didn't really like any of them, and I thought the ending was contrived and not believable.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's a great way to pass the time by. It is really fun to play. I wish it came with more crowns...and I wish they districts so much.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This is a beautiful crafted book with amazing detail without being too wordy. Overall I would give this five stars except for one thing. The ending. The ending was so annoying to me that when I reviewed it, I could only give it three stars. I suppose if you like the kind of ending where you're like what was that!? Then that's okay but I don't like it so three stars.You will have to read and find out for yourself.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Even better than the first and hard to put down! Off to start the final installment now! Great, book! Thank you!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|well written and several story lines are meshed to tell an intriguing tale about Brazil, Nazis and genetics.  recommend as an entertaining read.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|So much more creative than a lot of newer movies. Great film! The plot was creative, and the scenery/set design was very impressive.
B000TDGGVU|5.0|This is a must read, great insight into how and why we make the choices we make. Really makes one think about the decision making process
1401917232|5.0|Gary Renard has done it again! It may seem that there's a repetition to what's been said before but there's also a great deal more in the latest book. I love Thaddeus's accounts to what went down in those days past. I feel rejuvenated in my course studies now because my friends kept telling me I was getting away from it and it showed in my attitude. So for those edging back to the ego's way of things get this book. It'll help a good deal.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is a wonderful book, informative and wonderfully written. Joshua Foer gives great insight into memory and memory training while sharing his own experience.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's got a lot of weapons and places and its fun and the customizable weapons are cool very good game and I recommend this game if you have a kindle fire
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Hands down, this is the best book that Stephen King has ever written. Don't be intimidated by how lengthy the book is because you won't regret it in the end. The characters transcend their fictional status and become people that you want to hear more about somewhere along the way. I do and I don't want King to write a sequel to this book. I do because I want to hear more and I don't because I don't want him to ruin it somehow!
B0047Y17P2|3.0|Good, but not a page turner.  I do want to read his next book to see if our protagonist becomes district attorney.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have used Yahoo Mail as my main non-work e-mail account for years and the new 'upgrade' is making me regret it. The platform is awful. The way that e-mail conversations are displayed is pretty lame, but the worst part about it is that it doesn't work very well. You have to click on different sections of the conversation to view them, but you can't scroll down using your keypad arrows and the only scroll bar is a tiny thin one right to the right of the messages; they've omitted the large one that should be to the far right of the screen. And if you don't click exactly on the scroll bar, it links to some other screen or exits you out of the message or something else ridiculous. Also, if you click in the wrong place when trying to write an e-mail, suddenly your keyboard keys have different functions and will exit you out of stuff or open up a chat window or advertisement or something irrelevant. The same sort of thing happens now when you download photos out of an e-mail. When you are done and want to exit the download screen, you have to click on an 'X' in the upper right corner that if you don't hit it exactly on the body of the 'X' will link you to an advertisement. I guarantee that was pretty much the heart-and-soul of the 'upgrade:' the desire to have the user accidentally click into advertisements.<br /><br />Honestly, these just scrape the surface of the many irritating and frustrating things the new 'upgrade' has introduced to an e-mail system that was totally solid. The old platform was simple, intuitive, and worked like a charm. I used to laugh at people that used g-mail because Yahoo was perfect. The joke was obviously on me, though. Now I have to either suck it up and use your new horrible e-mail account that is totally non-intuitive and that functions poorly OR I have to open a new e-mail account and begin the process of informing everyone that I've ever known of my new e-mail address and change that address with all of my business contacts and with allof my online accounts while at the same time transferring all of my archived e-mails from Yahoo to the new e-mail system and just hold my breath and cross my fingers the whole time that everything goes smoothly. Thanks Yahoo!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have always been skeptical about buying a wireless headset (main concern was sound quality).<br /><br />I went through 3 Logitech Precision PC Gaming Headsets before switching to the Razer Carcharias.  After my left speaker went in my Razer Carcharias I decided to give Logitech another try with the G930...<br /><br />The sound quality with this headset is amazing.  It took me a few days to get used to the 7.1 surround sound while playing BF4 and talking on mumble.  My favorite feature of this headset by far is the simple fact that raising the mic up will automatically mute my microphone.  It sounds like such a simple trait but it makes my life so much easier when people are constantly talking to me in person (I have mumble detect my voice, not push to talk).<br /><br />The headset itself is extremely durable and has a wide variety of settings to fit all kinds of heads (including slanted heads due to the speakers abilities to pivot 180 degrees).<br /><br />The audio and voice quality of the headset is superb and I can walk about 35 feet and still have perfect sound.  I often use these late at night while laying in bed and watching a movie to keep quiet, the fact that the headset is wireless makes this ten times easier.<br /><br />I have a Logitech G710+ so I don't really need more G-Keys but they are useful when not sitting at my desk (mainly for changing and playing/pausing music).<br /><br />My only complaint with the headset is after long periods of time (6+ hours) of wearing the headset the top of my head gets achy.  I have never had this particular spot hurt before (the majority of headsets will hurt your ears not the top of your head after prolonged use).  I avoid the pain by simply shifting where the band rests on my head.<br /><br />Overall a great purchase that I am glad I made.  I got this headset for 56% of the MSRP (hopefully you can too).  This headset is worth the investment, especially if you are someone like me who uses them for 8+ hours a day.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Funny just like I remembered it from when I was a young kid. Brings back memories of shows I've forgot.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Once again, Preston & Child have created a Pendergast masterpiece. Looking always forward.<br />Excellent story. Excellent characters. I enjoyed every word.
020161622X|5.0|I've been programming a long time, starting out with F8 2D A3 type programs on a Netronics Elf II. Being self-taught, I learned lots of languages, libraries, etc. but what I lacked was guidance in the discipline of programming. I realized this was a shortcoming, then happened to find this book in  a store. That's when everything changed.<br /><br />This book doesn't teach you a language, rather it teaches you how to create solid, reliable software that doesn't fall apart when you need to make a change. A lot of my early programs accomplished useful tasks and saved people a lot of time and money, but I always dreaded making changes, as I knew the edit/test/explode loop would be coming soon. Thanks to principles in this book, such as Don't Repeat Yourself, my software became more robust.<br /><br />I am the author of an open source program for making printed circuit boards using CNC routers  and milling machines. The program has been in use since 2003, has thousands of users worldwide, yet I have exceedingly few bug reports. The code is robust, and users who want too can look at the source and understand it. This is due largely to my having read and studied this book.<br /><br />Some other reviewers criticize the book because some of the language is dated, such as referring to TCL/TK as a \\"scripting language.\\" Well, that isn't what the book is about. The language, for the most part, is irrelevant. The book is about principles for improving programming practices. Some criticize the book because some of the advice is simplistic, but it is only simplistic if the reader already knows it. I think the book strikes a good balance and speaks to a broad skill set.<br /><br />This is my favorite book in programming, and I recommend it to everyone I encounter that writes software, or who is entering the IT profession.<br /><br />Thank you Dave and Andy for changing my programming life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|oh simply the best story telling. Erotic to say the least. enjoyed everyone of these books equally. Such fun, such voyeurism.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|The story was fantastic with great action scenes and a superb storyline. You can see how each scene effects the next, and no what was that about that you see in other comic movies.
1439170916|5.0|One could only praise such a book.  And so have done most of the reviewers. Among the others one reviewer terribly surprised me in harshly criticizing the author's vocabulary in that it is very poor, consisting of some fifteen or so words only. Now, as someone who has persevered to finish the reading from cover to cover, I feel ashamed more than the author, against this criticism. This is because I had to look for a few words in the dictionary, almost on every page of the book. Okay, I am not a native speaker of English, but a reader in this language of nearly all sorts of literature, since over 40 years. But, apparently  having scored so badly in this endeavor, I have nothing to do but humbly withdraw my petition to the author, in which I would a little bit complain about his excessive(for me) indulgence in the language, in respect of vocabulary and highly colloquial-idiomatic style.<br />As to the content, I would like to say that the book has pretty well consolidated and replenished my earlier and rather loose knowledge in the field of cancer, obtained through previous readings of some popular books for the layman. Much more serious than all of them, and fully enriched by so many clinical facts and lively life stories, it has also explained quite better to me the mechanisms of cancer. Astonished and full of appreciation of the tremendous effort put in composing such a work it was a pity that I couldn't come out of this reading in high spirits. The impossibility of a radical cure bordering on certainty, or even the meaninglessness of such a concept well driven home, the best choice then seems to prepare and protect oneself against an ever threatening strike of this cruel emperor. But such are the bleak realities of life and the author, in an almost apologizing tone, conveys and confirms it for the case of cancer.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|They have a unique sound and some very tough and satisfying arrangements.  There sound is very balanced and each member of the group fill their role perfectly.  Great group!
B000RLCJ5Q|4.0|Way back when, some muckity muck in the CBS Records Promo Department had the brilliant idea to slap a sticker across covers of the new Clash double LP that read \\"The Only Band That Matters.\\" Even if the rest of the artists on the CBS roster might have been wondering a hearty WTF were they, chopped liver moment, but in 1979, The Clash actually felt like they could be that band. The band that all the hopes and dreams of rock and roll prophets whispered about in dark rooms when they quietly mused to themselves that a savior would be born unto them, bearing loud electric guitars, politically savvy lyrics and swagger that would never end. In 1979, it really felt like The Clash just might be that band.<br /><br />Well, we all know how those kind of dreams end up. When Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon kicked Mick Jones out of the band and recorded \\"Cut The Crap,\\" the world suddenly gave a collective yawn, and the general consensus to \\"Cut The Crap\\" was somebody, please pull the plug. But from 1979 to 1985, The Clash charged forth with revolutionary single after single often attached to stunning albums. If you don't have \\"London Calling,\\" stop reading this review and order it now. They may not have been the best singers or the most proficient musicians, but that didn't stop them from playing fast, loud and even early on, playing with reggae and other influences than their punk roots might suggest.<br /><br />So while you get the fury of \\"Clash City Rockers,\\" you have the single \\"White Man in Hammersmith Palais,\\" backing up the guitar roar with a reggae tune...both from their ferocious debut. Even more incredible is just how fast The Clash got better at what they were doing. The big riff of \\"London Calling\\" was matched by the almost soulful \\"Train In Vain\\" (their US breakthrough single). They were also going deeper into other musical forms, soon cutting rap-influenced songs like \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" and \\"This Is Radio Clash.\\" Even as bloated as \\"Sandinista\\" was, the singles \\"Hitsville UK\\" and the politically charged \\"The Call Up\\" could blow you over.<br /><br />It's interesting that their final, absolute American breakout was arriving as the band was beginning to fracture; \\"Combat Rock\\" delivered the remarkable \\"Rock The Casbah\\" and the big guitar attack of \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go.\\" The album cover itself had the band on train tracks, quite literally at a crossroads. But even after splintering, they still could pull one more ace out of \\"Cut The Crap,\\" the lovely and ironic \\"This Is England.\\" Then it was over, except for side projects (Big Audio Dynamite being the most successful). But for the 20 singles collected on this disc, the final song sums it up. These were \\"Groovy Times\\" indeed.\\"Hitsville UK\\" and the politically charged \\"The Call Up\\" could blow you over.<br /><br />It's interesting that their final, absolute American breakout was arriving as the band was beginning to fracture; \\"Combat Rock\\" delivered the remarkable \\"Rock The Casbah\\" and the big guitar attack of \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go.\\" The album cover itself had the band on train tracks, quite literally at a crossroads.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|After reading Divergent and Insurgent, I loved the series and would have highly recommended it to anyone. After finishing Allegiant, I withdrew all support for the series. The ending is painful, and the entire book is not written as well as the first two. Very disappointed.

B0046179EO|5.0|This remastered version is great. I purchased the vinyl in the 70's and thought about converting to digital. Glad I ordered from Amazon instead. I like the tracks on the original album, but am not too keen on the extended extra tracts. I just leave them off when I load to my mp3 player. I can certainly hear the Beatles influence on several tracts. Great purchase!
B0043U7XJO|4.0|Robin Hood is a character of legend, an amalgam of people in English history. A story of this legendary man amongst legendary characters and events surrounding him has come to life in popular myth and movies have been made to memorialize this legendary character. This version of Robin Hood starring Russell Crowe includes a more synthesized characterization of the legendary hero woven into more historically verifiable events - more or less - to create a similar but perhaps more realistically believable story of Robin Hood. That being said, this movie robs some of the swaggering, swashbuckling fantasy from the story and inserts a more serious storyline that is at least if not more hopeful than the original. I really enjoyed this movie and Highly Recommend it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 4 YO and I simply love this movie.  Its cute for kids and funny for adults too. Steve Carrell absolutely makes this movie; no doubt in my mind.  There are some criticisms about the kids at the adoption agency and the way it portrays adoptive kids and homes, and I think lots of those are valid points.  They aren't necessary to the plot, in my opinion.  It's just a fun movie, light, and too goofy to be serious.
B004V73FGE|3.0|&#34;TRON: Legacy&#34; is a follow-up to &#34;TRON&#34; and hits the mark for adventure, imagination and entertainment. The 60's Hippie crap turned me off as a viewer; but, the CG and the action kept me in the movie.
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Pretty fun and entertaining, not as good as the original.  The biggest problem is that this movie is missing a lead kid role, like Boo in the original, so the younger ones don't have a human child character to connect with.  They miss a lot of the college themed jokes too.  So maybe a little on the older side for the kids.  I have a 4 YO and I would say several of the jokes are incomprehensible to her because of the college theme, but there is still a lot of the bumbling and goofiness to keep her entertained even if she does not truly understand the plot.
B000OV85AW|5.0|Papillon is based on a true story of a prisoner on the penal colony of French Guyana. It's a highly entertaining movie and includes the mega-star power of Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Powerful performances, breathtaking scenery, gut-wrenching writing, and a dramatic presentation that only comes once-in-a-while. This movie is gripping as a statement of man's inhumanity to man; and a testament of indomitable human spirit. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND &#34;PAPILLON&#34; for captivating and thrilling entertainment.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a must read for history buffs and anyone attempting to understand how thing got to where they are today. So much of this is being repeated in the USA that you need to wonder how stupid people are to be lead by their own ignorance!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|&#34;Proof Of Heaven&#34; is a book I've read that I'm not sure how I feel about it, but it stays on my mind. Life after death is a compelling question for all human beings. I personally believe in an afterlife. I am a spiritual person. I may not be the reader this book was intended for. I'll be reading it again, and I'll be thinking about it more, that much is certain.

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|&#34;Iron Man  2&#34; (I can't help it) I love this movie. It is hands-down, the best Iron Man movie in the franchise. From the opening Stark EXPO Dancers to the action-packed thrill ride to the end. The best cast in any movie. Mickey Rourke really makes Iron Man 2 what it is - he sizzles - literally!  STRONGLY RECOMMENDED! My Fav!

Aaron Ekhart and all the other actors in this movie really deliver. You gotta love U.S. Marines if you're an American Patriot. John Wayne himself was never better channeled by any actor in any other movie. I do love this movie, it has all the bells and whistles of patriotism, humanism, desperate survival, and guts 'n glory dedication. Heroic, human, and this movie delivers the goods! STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

Was pleasantly surprised the day the album came out I was able to listen to the audio rip version of it on the Amazon cloud player while I was at work, the CD was not scheduled to be delivered to my house until that weekend. It was SWEET! I didn't even know it came with the free audio rip version of it so now I can listen to it on my phone whenever I want. I'm not the only person in the world that still buys CD's am I?
B000HF0ISC|5.0|A friendship between four adolescents in New York City that find themselves in trouble, and punished harshly for their prank, which follows them into adulthood. Good story telling and acting.
B00DMEQP2S|5.0|Bought this from a local store for $30. I thought it was pretty steep. Initially I wasn't too into it. But now 8 mos later, I'm blown away. This is no doubt a masterpiece. Side A is a nice dream, popish and edgy. But side B just goes off the deep end to another world. Its hard to describe it really. World-class song writing and production? Standing the test of time? You have to hear to experience it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this because It works for cheating for money! I mean skip your time to a day and give  u daily rewards and repeat til u get lots of fucing money!!

1891252089|3.0|Beautiful pictures.  Well put together.  I just wanted it for my yoga book collection, since it was a first edition copy.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So far I am loving this game. So much better than the Facebook version. So far it runs flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;. One thing I am loving is the lack of &quot;energy&quot; so you don't have to play for ten minutes and stop to wait a couple hours. You can play as long as you wish at a time. I highly recommend this game. The irony is, the music sounds like the music from the Sims games.
1455525839|5.0|&#34;White Fire&#34; is the latest installment of Preston & Child's series featuring their signature character, Aloysius Pendergast, a special agent for the FBI and a modern day Sherlock Holmes.  I found this effort to be an  outstanding, highly readable stand-alone adventure for long time Pendergast fans as well as brand new readers.  This time, the action occurs mainly in the US at a ritzy ski resort in Colorado called Roaring Fork where the ultra rich play and connive.<br /><br />Corrie Swanson, Pendergast's protégé, is drawn to Roaring Fork in hopes of studying the remains of miners supposedly killed and eaten by a grizzly bear in 1876 that were recently unearthed when a graveyard was dug up to be moved so a new high class development could be built on the ancient site.  Something she discovers apparently threatens powerful forces and she lands in jail where her only recourse is to reach our to Pendergast.  He has been mourning in Europe and finds this case the perfect impetus to get back into his life of crime fighting and soon has Corrie out of jail as the mystery widens.  Soon Agent Pendergast is following leads developed from a rumored meeting between Oscar Wilde and Conan Doyle in the late 1800's where the horror that occurred in the nineteenth century mining town was passed from Wilde (who heard it on a visit to America) to Doyle who may or may not have later used it obliquely in one of his published and one of his &#34;missing&#34; unpublished Holmes' tales.<br /><br />Pendergast quickly links a series of deaths and arsons in Roaring Fork to the ghastly deaths that Corrie has been studying and even returns to England in a search for the missing Sherlock Holmes story.  Meanwhile, Captain Stacy Bowdree, a recently discharged military veteran with PTSD and a descendent of one of the dead miners mysteriously arrives in Roaring Fork where she befriends Corrie.  What is her true purpose in coming to collect the remains of her long buried ancestor?  Is she whoshe purports to be?  And why does the most powerful family in the area want to silence Corrie in one manner or another?<br /><br />In addition to the  delightful references to Wilde and Doyle (a supposed meeting is recreated), there is a most satisfying vignette between Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes that, among other purposes, reminds the reader of the similarities between Holmes and Pendergast.  This entire angle of the plot opens a pleasurable excursion into the realm of &#34;what if&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;White Fire&#34; hits the ground running on all cylinders and holds the reader's interest until the very last page through a series of twists and turns, red herrings, and ever widening mysteries encompassed by a community so artfully created that the reader can almost feel the cold as the snow piles up.  As usual, Pendergast is as taciturn and brilliant in his investigations as the voluble Sherlock Holmes once was.  Indeed, we see aspects of Pendergast that have very infrequently been on display in past novels.  This is a well crafted suspense filled thriller that will keep readers guessing until the violent finale and denouement.  I cannot recommend &#34;White Fire&#34; highly enough as a reader of all the Pendergast novels.
B00FLNRN06|5.0|I wasn't too sure about renting this movie until a friend suggested it.  Bored, with nothing to do, I decided to give it a shot.  I was very surprised!  If you have a nasty sense of humor, this is the movie for you!  The gag reel at the end is GREAT!<br />The character chemistry was good and witty.  The storyline and plausibility are elementary and predictable, but I didn't really think about it too much just wondering what one of them was going to do next.  I recommend this to all comedy lovers
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game, a good change from plain Klondike solitaire or free cell.  A fun time waster anyou.d may it challenge

159463176X|5.0|I haven't read any of his other books and now I plan to go buy and read them all. Absolutely fabulous.<br /><br />I get kind of annoyed with stories that are really the stories of many people who are just slightly interconnected. But Hosseini does a good job of truly telling the story of one &#34;main&#34; person, but through the histories of many other characters. The way the characters are connected make each of them absolutely essential to understanding family and culture.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Coming from a seasonal, somewhat fair-weathered Pearl Jam fan, Lightning Bolt almost missed me.<br /><br />Heard the first single around the time the Dallas concert was announced, so my curiosity was peaked. I immediately loved the first single &#34;MIND YOUR MANNERS,&#34;  which I downloaded as a single before the album's release date, and picked up the disc as soon as it came out.<br /><br />Originally, I was disappointed. Sirens really caught my ear (it's going to be one of my all-time favorite songs,) but nothing else really stood out.<br /><br />Knowing that they were going to play  multiple songs from the new LP on stage, I listened to it over and over and over....<br /><br />And then I got it.<br /><br />Kind of like my love of beer, which I HATED at first. I tried and tried and tried and then - finally - BOOM!<br /><br />This album isn't going to suit an immature musical palate, nor is it going to give you a buzz unless you're patient. You've got to be patient and wait for it. And then you hear and feel the beauty of intelligent, powerful, beautiful musicians at the transcendental top of their craft.<br /><br />Anyhow, I love the album and thought I'd throw in my two cents.

B00008J2PG|5.0|If I could have only 1 movie ever---it would probably be this one.  What a combination of great acting, truth, history, suspense, and laughter.  Appropriate for all ages.  This is a true classic.  Gregory Peck is superb and what a surprise to see Christopher Plummer in a role 180 degrees out from his role in The Sound of Music.  Is there a rating called 5 start plus?  It should have it.

1781162646|4.0|Despite the lurid cover art, garish colors, and hyperventilating promo copy, [[ASIN:1781162646 Joyland (Hard Case Crime)]] isn't about crime or horror.  If you go into it with either in mind, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Instead, accept JOYLAND for what it is:  a nostalgic look back at the recent past, when giant corporations didn't yet dominate every aspect of entertainment, when youth still had a dewdrop of innocence about it, and when, with a bit of luck, something magical might happen.  And if you could put a soul to rest and bring a bad guy to justice, all the better, but purely tangential.  Enter JOYLAND with these modest expectations in mind; then you'll have a very good time, perhaps as much as little, doomed Mike does toward the end.<br /><br />In short, Devin Jones after completing his junior year at the University of New Hampshire heads south to become a summer carny in an old amusement park nearing the end of its life.  Actually, he's fleeing unrequited love, having been led on and eventually rejected by Wendy; he's infected with her.  He adapts well to the carny life, becoming a valued member of the staff, appreciated by co-workers and loved by the little kids who gleefully shriek at his performances as Howie the Happy Hound, mascot of Joyland and a minor icon.  Shortly, he learns of a horrible murder that occurred a few years past in the horror house and the ghost of the murdered girl rumored to roam the place.  The murder eats at him, especially after a friend claims to have seen the ghost.  With the help of a fellow summer employee, he sets out to find the murderer.  Along the way, he meets and befriends a little sick boy, Mike, and his mom, Annie, ten years his senior.  In the end, Devin solves the mystery, Mike, who has the sight (remember [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]]), helps save him, and Annie fulfills every young guy's fantasy.<br /><br />Really, though, Joyland and the carny life, and what would seem to be simpler times, are the stars of the story.  King paints some nice pictures of summer work and friendships, of challenges faced and overcome, of rejection and new affections, and the romance (in spite of the hard work and long hours) of the carnival life and summer at the beach.  He slings around enough carny vocabulary to have you feeling you might be able to pitch in, or at least converse, with the migrant carnies who may root themselves in your town for a week each summer.<br /><br />To enjoy JOYLAND, forget suspense; heck, forget even an intelligible plot; give yourself up to youthful summer and the carny life.stars of the story.

0553386697|5.0|I would recommend The Whole-Brain Child to parents who are interested in improving their child's mind and critical thinking. As your child is developing it is important to assist development at all aspects of life (cognitively, emotionally, socially, with relationships, and with literacy). The Whole-Brain Child talks specifically about strategies that are appropriate to help your child integrate those five different aspects of the brain. The book gives examples, as well as do's and don'ts to help you facilitate their learning experiences. This book is useful to anyone who interacts with children up to the age of 12. It was well written and appropriate for all readers.
1476758581|1.0|I AM Very Very dissapointed about This commercial book.  She doesn't have anything else to teach us? She wrote it just to create a continuum of books.  I was wondering when she will write a book before this one, and when it appeared I start reading about the theme and realized that it is just about the life of other people.  I can understand that everyone has different but the same chances to progress in life.  I don't like it at all.  It was very disrespectful about her to betray us with just a book like this.

B00CO4GO7I|4.0|It's a well-written book, with details galore on the various firearms this man used, both in the service and since.<br /><br />Non-gun enthusiasts may find the nuts-and-bolts descriptions tedious at times, but Mr. Kyle writes (and no doubt speaks) plainly about what he had to do and how he did it.  To him, a gun is a valuable tool, which is the proper attitude towards any weapon, particularly firearms.<br /><br />Gun-control politicians and their supporters could learn a lot from this book.

B00008QSA5|5.0|Mike Bloomfield, Stephen Stills, Al Kooper. The first (and still the greatest) &#34;Super Group&#34; ever recorded. Bloomfield was, of course, a seminal influence in rock guitar, especially in the resusitation of the blues in popular American music. Kooper was his equal (and was the inspiration for the original Chicago Transit Authority, which morphed into Chicago). Still's displays his outstanding playing (and singing!) which made him the key part of so many groups in the '60's and '70's. This is fabulous blues/rock of the American kind (not the pale imitation imported from England), with three young musicians at the height of invention. I've enjoyed this album as an LP, on 8-track, cassette, CD and MP3. From a sound perspective, I believe that the re-mastered CD provides the best all-around sound.

Even if you're playing your lossy iTunes files through this thing you will be delighted. I use this device with the following headphones: AKG K701, Denon AH-D2000, Sennheiser HD-25, Sennheiser HD650. Works beautifully with all of them. Might not have the bloom and depth of my Ray Samuels Predator... But few other amps do anyway.

0062197266|5.0|I have now read all three of Elizabeth Haynes' novels and am dying for more! I loved Human Remains, then was so-so about her other book and expected this one to be somewhere in the middle. I was pleasantly surprised. Frankly, I think this is pretty much a perfectly constructed psychological suspense novel. The story opens with a brief transcript of a trial, then goes back and forth between present and past as we meet Catherine Bailey, a young woman crippled by OCD and trapped in a life of fear. We very gradually learn the cause of Catherine's condition. Each chapter is very short, making this a page-turner. Catherine's past is very different from her present state, and the reveal as to why is drawn-out and suspenseful. As the book gets closer to the end, we discover the horrific truth about what made Catherine the way she is, and her OCD terrors are suddenly revealed to be all too well-founded.<br /><br />This book creates the same kind of claustrophobic feeling that Catherine herself feels being trapped in her tiny OCD world. It is very much &#34;inside her head&#34; and one element of it I loved was how, at a certain point, the reader begins to question absolutely everything in the story. This recreates Catherine's own feeling that she is possibly going mad.<br /><br />As the book neared its ending, the suspense was so intense that my heart literally pounded at times. When my husband startled me as I was reading, I shrieked and dropped the book! I literally felt on the edge of my seat and on the verge of screaming at many points. This is one of those books where you will stay up till 4 a.m/ignore all your household responsiblities/ignore your family members in your obsession to finish it.<br /><br />This book does have some intense and disturbing violence and sexual violence. I would rate it similarly to the &#34;Dragon Tattoo&#34; books on that level.<br /><br />In addition to being a great suspense novel, this book is a fascinating look at (POSSIBLE SPOILER) abusive relationships and will really make any woman think about how frighteningly easy it could be to end up trapped in this type of situation.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|There isn't much need to expound further upon the praise heaped upon this book other than to say this is definitely one book that everyone should read. Simply put, this work prods you to be conscious of your intentions and responsible for your choices surrounding circumstances you can control, as well as those you can't.  I am a better person for having read this, thank you, Viktor Frankl, from the bottom of my heart .
B004J4WL50|5.0|This book inspires greatness and hasn't an ounce of pretentiousness involved. The writing is clear, concise and has a straightforward message. Anyone thinking of entrepreneurship or business management would benefit from this read. Heck, even if you are not looking into a business career, this is a book for you. It's a motivator.

B008RA3X5E|1.0|When alarm goes off, the screen is covered with an ad and you can't shut the alarm off.  Also, there's no way to temporarily disable the alarm without canceling it for the day and then having to re-load all of the settings.  There needs to be a way to set default settings for volume and snooze time.  Very unsatisfactory and irritating ap.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga has done it yet again. Despite all the negative blows coming toward Gaga and this album I personally think ARTPOP is some of the greatest musical extravagance she's made to date. The people saying it is bad or an &#34;Artflop&#34; are completely blinded by the conformed radio stream. Everyone is so conflicted because of it on the account it's different than what's on the main-stream radio right now. Gaga has done it again with ARTPOP even though it didn't reach the first week financial success as Born This Way, but this album, this album is still Gaga. This album is still genius from the first beat of &#34;Aura&#34; till the last &#34;A-R-T-P-O-P&#34; in &#34;Applause&#34;.

B008JFUO0Y|3.0|THE EVIL DEAD<br /><br />If there was ever a film that did not need a remake t was this one in my opinion. The original and its sequels are three of my all time favorite films. So when I learned of this remake I was sure I would enjoy all that much. I never hate on any film before seeing it but a little part of me was expecting to be disappointed. Thankfully I was not as disappointed as I thought I would be. When I found out Raimi, Campbell, and Tapert were going to produce I rested a little easier.<br /><br />The film follows five friends who are going to a secluded cabin to help out Mia who has a drug problem. Once there things are going well until a stench from the basement leads them down to investigate. Once down there they come across the Book of the Dead. Reading from it they summon a demon even though they don’t know it yet. Mia feels it and wants to leave but the group thinks she is suffering from withdrawal. Things could not be any further from the truth as the demon is very real and the night is about to get real interesting.<br />Although there is plenty of nods to the original this is very much a new take on the “Evil Dead”. Fede Alvarez who co wrote and directed this picture did a good job with the atmosphere and gore of the film. In fact this movie may be more blood filled then the first. That of course does not mean it makes it a better film. The cast does a great job here with Jane Levy being the best here, although the way her character turns out or whatever I was not big fan of.<br /><br />This is a gory flick and can be a little intense at times for any of you young ones out there. The film is rated R for a reason and as far as that goes this film is a winner. But the film to me remains only a good film when it could have been great. The movie seems to be doing all the right things but it just falls short for some reason. Still the Blu-Ray comes with a lot of excellent bonus features like all the behind the scenes stuff and a commentary. Over all this is a good flick but it falls short of the original.

1476727651|5.0|When I first heard that there would be a sequel to The Shining, I was excited, not because I would finally see Danny Torrance again, but because I would get to read more from such a talented writer. As a teenager, I enjoyed the horrific thrill of Stephen King's stories; as an adult, I've fallen in love with his genius and style.<br />Within a day, I gobbled the first 75-percent. I savored the remaining 25. The conclusion of the Torrance legacy (if we are indeed done with DT), has such depth and brilliant complication, yet there was never a point where I became weighed down or overstimulated by the action. Stephen King is an artist -- a musician with the power to draw the reader in, to hold back yet keep building until that final, powerful note.<br />Perhaps the strongest evidence of the author's mastery of this particular story is how I, a constant reader, was able to know what was going to happen a few sentences before it happened: a small touch of the shining: a gift from the King to his loyal court.

B004DMIIUU|1.0|This is a pretty bad movie.  All of the plot elements are derivative from one source or another, with an overwhelming amount of cliched dialogue and situations.  To make up for the lack of originality in the story, they jazz up the visual elements with anachronistic hairstyles, make-up and costumes.  The CGI is bad, and there's way too much of it.  Was there a single shot that didn't have CGI?  It will take awhile for me to get over the fact that I wasted money and time (a lot of time, too, 2 hours and 10 minutes) on this junk.  It's meant to look epic, but it's just silly.  Let me just say this about the plot: it's yet another movie about two guys who grew up as brothers (though they're not biological brothers) who become enemies in adulthood.  That's just one of the tired details.  I could go on and on... Did I mention the bad acting, or the terrible, terrible (terrible to the point of being distracting) soundtrack?  Everybody walks through this movie trying to look very serious because &#34;this is an epic we're making.&#34;

B00D2CYU2W|1.0|I am totally mystified by this movie.  Why would an all star cast and production company produce a movie like this?<br /><br />Liberace was an exceptional musician and one of the giants of the entertainment industry.  He was a true pioneer and innovator.  He taught the world how to truly entertain people.  The glitz was an important part of the show.  No one before him had ever entertained in such a flamboyant manner.  He raised the bar for all types of entertainers.<br /><br />None of that came out in this movie.  The only message conveyed was that he was emotional unstable and sexually promiscuous.  The explicit love scenes and partial nudity added nothing to the story.  I am a fan of all the great actors in this movie and generally agree with the social agendas that they have publicly supported.  This seems out of character for all of them.  It totally lacked class.  I am unable to find any redeeming value here.<br /><br />Though the acting was great, Michael Douglas was still Michael Douglas.  The tone and cadence of his voice as well as his facial expressions prevented me from seeing anyone but Michael.<br /><br />If this was an attempt to support gay rights, it was a miserable failure.  The fact that he was gay was only a detail.<br /><br />If you want to know anything about Liberace, I would suggest the 1988 movie, Liberace: Behind the Music.  Victor Garber does an outstanding job of portraying the compassion, joy, and humor that was always evident in Liberace's performance.  When he looked into the camera, you sensed that he was truly invested in making your day better.  It also gives some insight into what made him who he was.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000ERVKF8 B000ERVKF8]]
0545586178|4.0|It was good, but really slow moving. The &#34;games&#34; went on forever, and I wished that we could get on with the story about Katniss and Peeta's life in District 12 as victors. Even though it was slow moving, it left me on the edge of my seat, or bed rather, because that is where I spent most of my time reading it. I wanted to read Mockingjay immediately after I finished Catching Fire because I wanted to see what happened to Katniss and Peeta. I also wanted to know what happened to Katniss's family. I like Suzanne Collins writing because she describes everything in detail, as if I was in the book.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very good for light reading and entertainment. A bit predictable but entertaining nonetheless.  Grisham certainly knows how to spin a homey yarn.
B0000C6K09|5.0|If you like his music this is the best CD for you to have.  His best stuff is on this CD and it is so much fun to pop it in and listen and guess all the movies the songs have been in.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Need it be reviewed? If you're reading this, you know what the trilogy is about and how it was done. Enjoy the master pieces in high definition, along with lots of bonus content to feast your curiosity in.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|AMAZING!!  If you like Harry Potter you cant do better then all of the movies in one spot.  The collection was well packaged and a great quality.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Use it every day with my Macbook Pro at work.  Super fast and reliable.  Works perfectly.
B003UESJJC|4.0|Completely sealed, original edition and is a great addition to the original issue.  Collectors will appreciate getting this because of all the 'extras' included.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use this site on my PC and searched for it ASAP after firing up my Kindle Fire. It's fast, accurate, and fun. Get it!
B00FEJHPRI|5.0|Marvel knocks another homerun outa the ballpark.  I only wish they had more hard rock music in the sound track, like Ozzie or AC/DC.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Stupid, stupid stupid.  Extremely weak script and acting.  Not even entertaining even a little bit.  I turned it off after about 20 minutes because it was a complete waste of my life.  I don't know what I was thinking when i ordered this.
B00AH6ATMG|5.0|I know a lot of Metallica fans havd been disappointed in they're newer stuff. But for me, I am among the &#34;next gen&#34; fans who appreciate the more approachable rock n roll of Load, Reload, St. Anger, Death Magnetic, etc. Great stuff!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love The Wire so much, and this show is comparable in quality in every way.  Great story line, incredible acting, very, very unique plot.
B0095P341S|5.0|Fantastic! Marvel has succeeded in adapting comics to the big screen like no one else. RDJr was born to play Tony Stark.
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|Canadian power trio Rush's brand new triple live album (and off-shoot DVD/Blu-Ray) Clockwork Angels Tour is a must for ALL RUSH FANS!<br />Recorded in Dallas, Texas at American Airlines Arena in November of 2012 just as the first leg of the Clockwork Angels Tour was winding down and sees Rush capturing a majestic show (this is the second Rush concert film that came from a US performance although some bits of 1989's A Show of Hands album were recorded at shows in the US) into a powerful triple live CD.<br />I must confess, even as a longtime Rush fan (solid Rush fan here since 1990 and are my favorite band alongside Pink Floyd and Genesis), that some fans are starting to complain that Rush is releasing too many live albums (like Iron Maiden and post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd , David Gilmour and (as recent) Queen) but such as life. Then others complaining about Geddy Lee's voice being off for this show (he might have either been under the weather or whatever for the show, then there are the bellyacher reviewers who must be either Britney or Gaga or Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry fans who want things pitch perfect). Despite Geddy's voice sounding strained on high notes (lest not forget the 1978 portion of Different Stages in 1998 had Geddy singing with a bad cold and his voice struggled and his voice was tired from a long tour on Time Machine) his always excellent bass guitar playing and keyboards here more than make up for it. Alex Lifeson's guitar work is excellent as always and Neil Peart's drumming hasn't lost a step. Plus the addition of a string section was a brilliant touch.<br />I'm not complaining about Rush releasing yet another live album. Thing was, I missed the The Clockwork Angels Tour (just like I did the Time Machine Tour two years earlier due to the economy being at an all time low (and it's not getting any better folks believe me) and also Roger Waters was touring with The Wall at Fenway Park so I went to see Roger perform The Wall and The Who perform Quadrophenia in Boston but knowing Rush very well (and being a 20 plus year fan), I knew a live CD and DVD/Blu-Ray would come from the tour (it's the second tour I missed since the Roll the Bones Tour in 1991/92). In my view, it's a great live disc and even superb Blu-Ray and gave me a chance to hear what I missed.<br />The first disc has stellar live versions of \\"Subdivisions\\", \\"The Big Money\\", \\"Force Ten\\", the rarely performed \\"Grand Designs\\" (not played since 1986), the scarcely performed \\"The Body Electric\\" (not played since 1984), an excellent \\"Territories\\" (not played since 1988), a stellar version of \\"The Analog Kid\\" (last played in 1994), a stellar \\"Bravado\\" (last played in 2004), the classic \\"Where's My Thing\\" (not played since 1992) with a drum solo from Neil called \\"Here It Is\\" which then segues into the reprise of WMT. We close CD 1 with a great version of \\"Far Cry\\".<br />The second set is the Clockwork Angels set which sees Rush joined by the Clockwork Angels String Section who add life to the Clockwork material. We start with \\"Caravan\\" which rocks. Then it's the title song which is more menacing than its studio counterpart. \\"The Anarchists\\" follows and just burns. Then \\"The Carnies\\" comes along and kicks you right in the a double crooked letter. The melodic \\"The Wreckers\\" follows and is a great version. \\"Headlong Flight\\" is next and is a killer version and has a second Peart solo out of \\"Drumbastica\\" before it goes to the reprise of \\"Headlong Flight. Alex's solo \\"Pekes Repose\\" is an intro to the melodic \\"Halo Effect\\". We then rock with \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" which rocks out like gangbusters. We also have the conciliatory \\"Wish Them Well\\" which is a great version. \\"The Garden\\" ends the second CD and is a song that is a stellar number, even with the orchestra.<br />Disc Three features more with the symphony such as \\"Dreamline\\" which is a stellar rendition. Next Neil gives us the electric drum percussion workout \\"The Percurssor\\" before we go into the classic \\"Red Sector A\\". Then it's \\"YYZ (yyZED for the Canadians and British readers and YYZ for the simpler Americans) with an orchestra. We close the show with the classic \\"The Spirit of Radio\\". The first encore is a stellar version of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and is followed by \\"2112 (Overture/Temples of Syrinx/Grand Finale)\\". Then as a bonus, you get a soundcheck version of \\"Limelight\\"  plus live versions of the rarely performed \\"Middletown Dreams\\" (brilliantly performed I may add), the classic \\"The Pass\\" and \\"The Manhattan Project\\" (last played in 1989) and a great version. All of which were recorded in Phoenix sans Limelight recorded in San Antonio.<br />The artwork is cool as are the picture booklet and also the sound here is superb! The Blu-Ray and DVD will be here soon.<br />For Rush fans who are hardcore fans and who like to have a souvenir of every tour, like myself, scoop this live album up! For those who don't either like it or don't want it then stay clear.<br />RECOMMENDED!ed Sector A\\".

0553582011|5.0|you need to go back and refresh your memory on who a few of these people are. But so far it's awesome!
B004BCT2HU|5.0|Fell in love with David Garrett's music, seeing him on Public television. Check it out, he is truly gifted and his music is unique.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie and can not wait for the sequel!!! I could not stop laughing. Definetly a must buy!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Purchased this for my son for his 21st birthday -- it is what he wanted!  He loves it!!!  I guess it does many more things than I could understand but he said it is fantastic for connecting directly to the internet AND he can somehow display his laptop directly onto the big screen TV now...go figure!!!
B000ZM1FXO|5.0|extraordinary in it's historical clarity. if not one of the best performance by the entire cast whom must have been relapsed by the story.it is truly a work of art for the rest of human history.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! I love it! Read, read, read!!!!! It's amazing! Yay! yay! yay! yay! yay! I want to read it again!
B00FHB7398|5.0|One of the best games,bigfish has put out besides the shiver games,the spiders bothered me just a bit because your graphics are so good,but I still recommend it .... Bigfish has the best games priced right too.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It was okay but if you're into zombies, The Walking Dead tv series wins hands down!  Brad Pitt being undestructable was a little much.
B001QFZADA|5.0|This book will help you deepen your understanding of Love in ALL your relationships. You may be speaking a foreign language to your spouse, parents, friends or children!
B00000IQW5|4.0|Replaced my VHS copy with this movie - great re-watch value. Happy that I have it in my collection again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am new to this.  It is fast moving and I am enjoying it.  Usually I played Bejeweled so it is just a little different.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is a beautifully written novel.  A great read with a cup of tea.  It's a warm and cozy read.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|ARTPOP is a great cd, i hope people give the cd a chance that is what makes Lady GaGa different she stands on her own and walks her own line and doesn't follow everyone else.
0553296981|5.0|Just what we needed.  Our child is reading this in school.  This is the exact same edition.  We like to have a copy at home, so she doesn't have to carry her school copy back and forth.  This eliminates leaving the book at school or home.  The price on this copy if great too.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|Kiss of Steel was a pretty good read. I have been interested in steampunk genre lately and this was one of the books that caught my eye. The price is a bit steep for the read, but the ideas were fresh and different. They are not burdened in the genre that everyone has been dishing out lately. I did skip through some of the more erotic parts because I was much more interested in the plot and the world that the characters lived in. The world that Bec McMaster created is very intriguing. Debating whether or not I will check out the next book.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|My whole family lives to play it. I am addicted more so. It's a great time killer and I love that there more to do. The only thing wrong is I wish it was easier to get crowns
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Great hit!  I throughly enjoyed this CD it really brought back some good old memories.  Whitney's music is still very powerful and moving.  I love her music and this is great to all to the collection.  this CD was so good my daughter took it from me.
0316074314|1.0|I read the entire book.  The book was not well written, the plot and characters are not well developed and I read another review by someone who compared it to a paint by numbers work of fiction which it is.<br /><br />I saw an interview with the author on TV and she's very narcissistic and full of herself.  She has no actual talent for writing and instead has just spent her entire life in nothing but academia, creative writing and literary theory classes-instead of the real world- and produced yet another work of pure mental masturbation and drivel which Catton spews way too many wasted pages about.<br /><br />Somebody needs to tell her to stop writing.  Or an editor should have told her to cut down her novel to 200-300 pages, or 500 at the most as the novel consists of horrible writing that goes nowhere.<br /><br />Man Booker prize contests are rigged and are based on politics, and paying off the judges than they are actual talent or writing ability.  This has been proven yet again since they awarded a total hack writer like Catton the award for a poorly written novel like this, while bypassing other well written works of actual literature by other authors.
B006BFK5DK|2.0|this is my all time favorite group but for the second time in their long career, i feel they came up short. there is nothing special to say about this cd. it will just be an unplayed cd in my collection. i have every album/cd they've made so this has to be for collection purpose only
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Not as good as the first book, but glad Ky & Cassie are together...will be together in the end! Snooze on most of the desolated canyon endless details just wanted to finish those chapters & move on! Like Indie so hopefully in the third book her or Xander do not betray Ky/Cassie & Hunter/Eli are ok!!!!
0062103377|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my young sister, she's a big fan of Supernatural. She said she really liked it and read the whole thing in a day. Definitely recommend if you're a Supernatural fan. :)
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock: Season Two is absolutely wonderful. Benedict Cumberbatch makes a great Sherlock who is filled (more or less depending on circumstances) with personality that keeps you entertained. The stories are transformed into modern day with excellent execution that leaves me wanting more.
B00094ARZ0|5.0|seen this movie a long time ago and never truly forgot it and been looking for this movie for years and now it's finally mine!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game! Highly addictive with stunning graphics. Hours and hours of fun. Challenging in a good way. I can't recommend any of the temple run games highly enough. Download today, you won't be disappointed. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I like challegeing games.  This one is fast and challegeing. Haven't gotten a chance to play it often because I have other games.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I would give this 10 stars if I could. I love it! Fantastic and easy way to save ideas and inspiring pictures from the web. You create your own categories according to your likes. You can enjoy other pinner's finds, and repin to your own board if you like. Highly recommended and addictive. Download and start enjoying today. :)
0385537131|4.0|along comes another great read from John Grisham that delivers a story that keeps you wanting to find out how all this is going to fall in place and justice is fairly given out. Grisham is back at what he does best. Gives a story that is filled with interest for all involved.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|5 stars from me just for the fun factor alone! Great game if you want to create your own farm. Hang on to your RC, very hard to come by if you don't want to spend real money. Download and enjoy. Highly addictive :)
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Doctor Sleep isn't your normal run of the mill story. It shows in its own twisted way a path to follow and a life to lead when trouble is near. Not only was it a sort of guide, it was phenomenally creepy with all sorts of twists and turns; taking the reader for one heck of a thrill ride. I give it 4 and a half stars
1616960922|5.0|Sanders is a master of making unexpected connections, many of times you yourself feel that you should have noticed but the books excitement and energy distract you from seeing them until they are reviled. A short book but containing an entire world metaphorically and literally fitting into a single room.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and enjoyable for kids and adults of all ages. Works great on my Kindle Fire. I really liked that I received an incentive of free coins just for downloading this app.
B0024FAG62|5.0|This is my favorite western movie ever. I like every aspect about it. If you have not seen it, you are missing out. I had it on Beta, VHS, DVD & now blu-ray.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Because it's an excellent series, for my Andy was the best actor in this Saga. This product is very good.
B000I2JKE2|2.0|The copy of Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut [HD DVD]  that I got would not play at all in my HD DVD player. I am going to purchase another copy and see what happens.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great. I can learn and have fun at the same time. You don't know you are using logic but you have a lot of thinking going on. Super fun you should totally play this.
B009LRE040|5.0|I'm going to make this review short. The plot is great.the fight scenes are great. the actors are great. everyone about the movie was good. only wish joker could have been in it tho :-(..... owell it was really great you will watch this movie a few times
B005K2KCPG|3.0|This is decent, but they seem a little more self-conscious than the debut CD. The reigns are being held tight by someone who want to be a song-crafter and a producer who thinks that Michael Anthony's back vocals need to be pitch corrected. It's a little over baked, but the spirit is still there. I really hope the next album has more of the raw rock vibe that drew me to their debut.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very fun and addicting. Im curious to know if they have more games like this one...I would very much like to play them.
1742204120|4.0|We're going to India in two months and found Lonely Planet India to be an excellent guide for planning our itinerary while there. It's packed full of helpful information.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the best book series ever.  I think that only people who enjoy survival and suspenseful books.  I chose this rating because I feel that these books are super suspenseful and adventurous and that is what I like in book.  I think there should be more books about Peta and Katnisses children and the hardships their parents face.
1742204147|4.0|This book has really helped me plan my trip to Japan next fall--I will be living in Kyoto for a few months. A colleague who had lived in Kyoto for several months some years ago had told me that Lonely Planet's Japan was the best guide for learning about Kyoto and Japan. I have found the guide to be very informative.
0307895505|5.0|Great product, includes all aspects of skyrim and all dlc content... I am so amazed with the detail and amount of pages, it is everything skyrim has to offer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game in the world.It is my top game that I have got all year.<br />It is $7.00 but it is worth it.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Here we meet a side of Pendergast we have not seen before.  Is this due to the loss of his loved one? Is age causing him to be less than what he was before?  Will new knowledge finally do him in?  Encounters with a killer, a son, and the new Natzies might prove to be too much for him.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|We have all waited a few years for  sequel. We got it in 5 stars. Original cast plus +++. Tommy Lee, young version is convincing, and the scenario is tight and very well produced. Worth waiting for !
B004SIMNF0|5.0|Excellent product. I am very happy with this purchase. I was looking for the right accessory for my dressing code and this is perfect. The construction is very strung and easy to use. I felt confident in my first event without much practice. I prefer it over any other strap solution.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Let`s spend an evening watching a movie that is slow, depressing, actors mumbling, drugs... Do you really want to go there ?<br />I find Denzel excellent in so many roles, but here he is struggling.<br />Also makes you never want to fly again...unjustly, since there is zero credibility in a drug addict and drunk pilot.<br />Waste of time. To be avoided.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Watched this with my fellow Treky fans.  It was fun to see the young crew and how they all came to be the seasoned supportive team of their future.  Great story line.
B00FWSWMKQ|5.0|This fantastic Doors history of their television appearances is being released in 4 different formats in both Europe and North America. For both the European market versions, which are being released earlier and the North American versions- you can choose from a Deluxe Set in either Blu-ray or regular dvd. Only the Deluxe Set includes a fantastic 40 page book that features a scrap book style presentation of each track including the song lyrics, photos, background information and trivia. This Deluxe Book Set comes in your choice of the Blu-ray or dvd versions. There will also be just the Blu-ray or dvd R-Evolution without the book for less money. The pre-order shown here is the Blu-ray North American U.S. version of just the Blu-ray. This is not the deluxe version with the extra 40 page book.<br /><br />I'm certain many Doors fans, like myself, have seen some of The Doors television appearances over the years- even The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour Television Show- Season 3 dvd includes a couple of The Doors appearances, but nothing like what is included here on this set. This is not a complete history, as you will notice not every television performance or film is included, as I immediately noticed The Doors second song on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour- Wild Child is not included, nor the famous Light My Fire from The Ed Sullivan Show. This is a history of The Doors Evolution on film appearances, as the title states, and not a complete history. Just seeing the Evolution of The Doors on film is wonderful enough, but it's the Bonus Material that make this worth watching. Included in this set are some very rare television appearances of The Doors, such as the band's full performance on Shebang, a Dick Clark interview, the color version of the band's appearance on Malibu U- including never before seen outtakes, and from German tv- the complete color version of Hello, I Love You. Besides television appearances over the years, you will also get to enjoy The Doors Films from the 80's, including a rare director's cut of the 1985 L.A.Woman short film.<br /><br />There are Bonus Features that are simply fantastic as well. A new edit by Murray Lerner from the 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival is included, as well as the extremely rare 1966 Ford Motor Company film with The Doors providing the sound track. All the audio, with the exception of the Ford Motor Company film, has been restored by Bruce Botnick- The Doors long time engineer and co-producer of the last L.A. Woman album. There are 19 total television appearances and short films included on this simply fantastic set. Not only are the audios restored by Bruce Botnick, but I heard the videos have been restored fantastically as well!<br /><br />Having these television appearances of The Doors finally complete with great audio and video restorations is a wish come true. My only other wish is that someone restores the Jim Morrison Highway film as well as The Doors Feast Of Friends film. I've waited decades for a good copy of these great short films and I really hope someone will bring them to dvd and hopefully Blu-ray soon for all of us Doors and Jim Morrison fans to enjoy as much as these television appearances! For now, I have to give a million THANKS to Eagle Rock Studios for all their hard work in bringing us Doors fans these fabulous television appearances and rarities- these are all MUST-HAVES for us Doors and Jim Morrison Fans!<br /><br />Here are all 19 appearances and films included, and of course, the 40 page book is only included in the Deluxe Version- not this Blu-ray only.<br />01.)

B009X01C64|5.0|This review is a little late and probably irrelevant now that the Kindle HDX has arrived! That being said this is a very nice case for your Kindle Fire HD. Yes it is pricey as these things tend to be. What vendors lose on the small mark ups of tablets and smart phones they make on accessories!<br /><br />Functionally this case is great. The padding make it comfortable to carry yet protects the Kindle very well. Yes I have dropped this a couple of time and so far no damage. This is at least partly luck though. Don't get over confident as this case is protective but it does not make your Kindle indestructible!<br /><br />As a base for viewing the case if well designed. Once mounted into the case your Kindle can spin a full 360 to access any ports. The case folding easily into position so you can set you Kindle standing in either horizontal or vertical orientations. You can also adjust the viewing angle somewhat to accommodate your exact position. This can help eliminate glare or reflections. I use my Kindle frequently for viewing videos so a sturdy case/stand was essential. This one fits the bill perfectly. Put Dora the Explorer on the Kindle in front of my 3 year old and you have a perfect snack time!<br /><br />I have owned this for 10 month now and with frequent use it still looks almost new. I see very little sign of wear on the case. The first thing to go on something like this would be the elastic but so far it has no evidence of wear and tear.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|When transposing the quantum principles of subatomic relativity to the parameters of musical possibility, the Eisenhower triplets were most benevolent in terms of massacring what was left of certain auditory crevices. In much the same manner, this artist embraces the terrestrial instrument known as a machete and proceeds to unleash it upon various notes and tones thereby rendering the landscape altogether unrecognizable. It is with this repeated action that said product is most unfathomable, both from a Victorian as well as a Renaissance perspective. In the age of Schopenhauer, it was altogether unanimously declared that the prime method to achieve unison with gravel and soil were to henceforth display qualities of the two items in question, which to much dismay, the artist has embraced most disconcertingly. In some circles, primarily those of the Neolithic era, specimens such as the artist in question were observed as an anomaly & an example of evolution's most cruel tricks upon truly unsuspecting masses. This in turn created two modalities, namely the butterfly effect & the Stockholm Syndrome, upon which this set is most unwittingly based. This would in part be a lesson in the loss of unrequited mirth, yet probing minds with a sense of inquiry and self reflection would relate this back to the era of the morse code, when undue importance was meted out to indecipherable messages that had no basis in reality or common sense to begin with. In the same vein, one could deconstruct this set by comparing the skills therein to the mimes of Paris, where invisible glass boxes became synonymous with a display of talent, despite there being a marked shortfall in said department. Most intriguingly, the bourgeois masses through the twenty first century, numbed by apathy and fatigue, are incapable of making the connection to things past, such as the design of watermarks in a vacuum and their invisibility thereafter, rendering things both non-essential and incapable of even existing, further destroying the third correlation to actual reality, which in turn is a concept best left alone. With time comes the return of certain vestibules, and the absence of vestibules altogether can only point to a negation of skill or the even more apt analogy that skill was non existent to begin with, unless one factored in slaughter houses. That opens up a plethora of various other possibilities, but in summary, it is best not to theorize and even better not to experience said product in a domestic or exterior environment without the backing of years of scientific and cumulative psychosomatic research.

B00915G6SU|5.0|What more is there to say but this is a great show. It's amazing the twist and turns that the writers come up with.
1451666179|5.0|Lovely little book.  I've been a longtime fan of Allie's blog, but I bought the paperback on impulse at the airport.  As an animal lover, the stories about her two dogs made me giggle uncontrollably, so much that the person sitting next to me on the plane sent miffed glances my way.  Some stories were laugh-out-loud funny, and some made me tear up a little.  I plan to keep this book on my shelf, and re-read in the future.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Is there a Love Love rating? Gibbs is the greatest and its just fun to watch how the whole team works together. Abby and her quirks just add that much more to the show.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|It was great to enjoy all of the one liner's by Freddie.  The whole series is fun.  This set was updating my collection to Blue Ray.  Just what I expected.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|DIDO<br />what can I say love her music<br />so of course she rates 5 stars.<br />easy listening. I could listen to her all day<br />worth it
0763621803|5.0|We picked this book up from our local library.<br /><br />Really liked this book as the young girl Lola doesn't like to eat certain foods. Kind of like K was for a while. We enjoyed how even though they were the same foods Charlie used her imagination to make them be something else and it seemed a lot more funner to eat them.<br />This is a perfect book to read to kids especially with those that are fussy eaters, as you can get an idea on how to get them to get their foods.<br />K's favorite part was the moonsquirters and I can see him using that term instead of tomatoes in the future.
0307279189|5.0|I am a runner ( run walk run method) and I am so interested in running stories of the elite runners<br />I read this book a while back and still think of quotes and of the elite runners that were profiled here<br />highly recommended read even if you are not a runner

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game.  Highly addictive.  The only thing that I am not a fan of is how often you run out of energy to continue your hunt.  I get it they want you to pay to play.. but that really does suck!

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga knows how to make music! She is the biggest start ever and a true dedicated artist. Her work is legendary.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Metal album of the year hands down!!!! Carcass prove again why they are the reigning band in this genre!!!  \m/
B00D7OXZTY|4.0|Until I read the information pages inside it, I didn't know what a polonaise was for sure, assigning it to a descriptive role like a sonata or something.  That it describes a dance style originally was to understand the music so much better.  I am not qualified to judge this artist's techniques or capabilities.  That he included track 6 was pleasing to me, because in 1945 there was a popular, big-band song, &#34;Til the End Of Time&#34; that I really enjoyed, based on the major theme there.  As to track 7: M. Beaujean's opinions were helpful in understanding why it was even linked with the track 6 music; contrary to his enjoying it, my thought is &#34;What is he basing his report on?  Did he listen to the same music I did?&#34;  As you can see, I am not a good person to ask about something so unique.  Having a grandson-in-law who is half-Polish, half-Anglo, my motivation to explore this record was to get to know more of his mother's background.  I thoroughly enjoyed it for having accomplished that.
B00004WIDR|4.0|In my opinion this was good.  The dino's are as incredible as in the first J.P movie.  Well worth seeing.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Anyone who can make giant aliens and robots entertaining on the big screen is a genius. Surprisingly great movie to see.
B001B1UO6W|4.0|This was great idea for scary movie.  I think Chucky got meaner and funnier in the next few movies but this was still very good.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|I love the concept of a wipes case with a snap on strap, but the case is a little faulty. First, the case is a little bigger than I expected it to be, and its definitely a little on the heavy side, which is a plus really. I like that its heavy enough but not too heavy, it helps when you're pulling the wipes out of a nearly empty wipes case. I don't feel like i can strap it to a stroller or the outside of my diaper bag because its a little on the big side. What I don't like about the case is the red sliding wipes door. It is constantly sliding out of place and on more than one occasion I've had to use somewhat dry wipes. Its just a matter of making sure you place the case upside down on the diaper bag or completely flat.<br /><br />I would still buy this case before I buy a regular snap open and close case. I just love that it hold its own weight and the wipes come out easily.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|I really like the movie. I love the sound track and how well it integrates with the action in the movie. Plus, my last name is Hanna so why wouldn't I like it?
B001C4AFOY|5.0|\\"The Young Victoria\\" is a film of rare beauty. This is truly one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. I adored Victoria's innocence and Albert's tenacity. Together they are magic. The costumes are also magnificent. This movie is not only a visual treat it is also filled with heartfelt emotions and delicious suspense. The most romantic parts of the movie are perhaps the sections where letters are being read. There is such an beautiful intimacy in letter writing of the past. This is the type of movie I want all my friends to see. I loved it!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B007JMW46U|3.0|It is a freebie for me so I won't complain. It was readable in my kindle app on my android phone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you like puzzles this is the game for you.  Figuring out the right combination of moves to reach the ultimate goal is a great brain work out. FUN FUN FUN!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It said that region 5 and 6 are out  but I only have 12 3 and 4 what is happening to the other two, please help!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Saw the review for this book at the doctor's office, loved it!  Read it in 3 days, couldn't put it down!
0811879542|5.0|This book is awesome - can't wait to see my Great-Granddaughter's reaction when it is read and does the actions!!!
B003K15IF8|5.0|A truly beautiful novel. Frustrating at times because you become so intimately connected with the protagonist. I'd definitely recommend it.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|OMG.  This set was completely worth the money!!  Very very worth it.  Got it for 45.00 and what a STEAL!!  My son and I cant get enough of it and we havent even watched the bonus DVD's yet.  Its VERY classy, hart cover, pics etc..  NICE
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|We found it most enjoyable. The music is great. It has all the right elements: Humor, joy,sorrow, good music,interesting location, great cast.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played Castleville on my PC and though it isn't exactly the same its similiar enough that it helps to have played it before. The graphics are great and the game flows just right. Some advice carried over from other versions, keeping building and stocking up all the time! Enjoy :)
B007PJLUG2|5.0|What a fun movie.  Love the actors.  It's a great family flick.  I have watched it over and over again.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Excellent app for my KFire that works without crashing! Just like mobile view of wikipedia, but in app form. It does have annoying pop-ups that prompt you about opening wiki links in either your app or the web, but you can choose a preference to prevent it from happening with each link clicked. Beyond that minor issue, no serious complaints about the app. Would recommend to those who like to browse wikipedia.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Best book ever!  What a great way to live.  I've been using the principles and it works. So far every paycheck I end up with more in the budget than expected.  I'm thankful for this book, the principles, the advice is life changing.  Thanks to amazon for selling it for my kindle!  My life feels wonderful now!  Why not live life on the bright side and be thankful for all you have.  I have a friend who complains constantly and I'm trying to get her to reverse her attitude.  Remain in negativity you get more negativity.  Get the MAGIC!!!
B009LDCZDC|1.0|Just got to episode 7 to discover that the sound track was faulty - no voice track available - had to watch using sub-titles. Tried to get a replacement but my order was from before the time limit for returns so now we're stuck with a faulty blu ray. So disappointed as I rely heavily on Amazon as my preferred supplier for music and blu rays/dvds. Haven't gotten to episode 8 yet so don't know if the problem persists from here on in or not.
