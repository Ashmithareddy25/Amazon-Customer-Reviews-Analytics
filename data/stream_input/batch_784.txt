0765318741|5.0|This was a great book!! It is so much better than the movie. Also the movie had changed the story way too much.  If you saw the movie and then read the book, you will be disappointed in the movie.  Also its interesting to note that this book was written in 1954 and takes place in 1976.  Also the ending was interesting.  Included in this book is not only the story \\"I am Legend,\\" but also contains other short stories created by Richard Matheson. But I would definently recommend this to anyone who was interested by the movie and want to read the actual book which is way better.
0743290119|4.0|There I am stranded in O'Haire Airport looking for something to read, having loved the movie Devil Wears Prada I saw the cover and decided to give it a try.  Sitting on the floor waiting for the plane I started reading and was hooked from the beginning.     Let me say I have never read a single line of \\"Chick Lit\\" before. I found this book has a real perspective that I have not seen or heard before, The 30 year old woman worried about getting older and being alone. The characters are great and DAMN if I could just get a look at Adriana and see what she looks like. By the end of the book I wanted to google her.     Sure you might be able to smell some plot points coming, but the payoff is in the heart of the plot point and the detailed world Mrs (or is it Miss) Weisberger creates in the head of these characters. As a male reader I found myself going \\"Oh so that's what they are thinking.\\" You chicks are complicated and although it's doesn't un-complicate women it might make a male understand what rattles around in their heads.    The phrase \\"Chick Lit\\" to me represented a bubble gum style book, what I mean by that is that once done with the book the flavor is gone with no substance. That is not true of this book. There are heart felt relationships, women who actually like \\"sex\\" and a search for your true self.     There is an incredible scene towards the end of the book where Leigh, naked, Looks at herself in the mirror after a life changing event and doesn't regret it only to have that regret seep in to both the reader and Leigh's heart.     The only fair comparison to Sex and the City is that there is a small group of women that are friends in New York. SatC covered the search for meaningful relationships. CHW starts out the same way, but subtly shifts to the search for ones self. There is more to this book than meets the eye. It's not only about learning to love other people, It's about making hard choices to eventually love yourself.    Guys might even find what goes on in women's head illuminating and the Parrot might be the greatest scene stealer!
B0002WZTOI|4.0|I originally saw this in the theater, and when this movie first came out on VHS, I saw it on a neighbor's in-home theater system, and the sensation was beyond words (for the time).    Fast forward to DVD and today's theater technology, and this is still a great movie. But the addition of the second disk really makes this a great deal. The background of the film and the commentary from those Naval aviators who did the flying made this something I could not pass up.    I was lucky enough to get a ride in an F-4 and land on the USS Eisenhower in the '70s, and the term \\"postage stamp in the middle of the ocean\\" doesn't begin to describe what you see.    This is a great deal, and I recommend it to all..
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I did not know what I was getting when I picked up \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" by Elbow as it was my first exposure to the bad. After living inside the album for a week, I still don't know what I have in \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" but I know I really like it.<br /><br />The lyrics are literate and the vocals evocative. The sound is engaging. Elbow does not sound like one band or artist in particular but rather sounds like a synthesis of several in general. \\"The Starlings\\" reminds me of [[ASIN:B00005K9Z6 Hot Shots II]] by The Beta Band. \\"The Bones of You\\" brings to mind the wonderful lyrics and vocals of Jeff Buckley on [[ASIN:B0000029DD Grace]]. \\"Mirrorball\\" doesn't sound like anything I have ever heard before; it is a wonderful song possibly without equal. \\"The Fix is in\\" calls to mind [[ASIN:B000003TSK Curtains]] by Tindersticks. Throughout the album you can hear influences by Pink Floyd, The Beatles, and even Coldplay.<br /><br />\\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\" is a great album to own as a whole and \\"Mirrorball\\" the greatest among many worthy songs on this album. A true gem worth owning.
0575082364|5.0|First off, let my just say that any fan of Reynolds will love this book. This is what makes A.R. so special. Its vast scale and huge timespan combined with a clear and interesting vision about the evolution of human societies over time. And its all presented in a good pace and with a interesting story, with characters you will care about. In short, its never boring. Quite the contrary. As with all really good books, its over all too soon, and you are just sad you can never again read it for the first time.     Buy it. You will not regret it.
B00006ZXSK|2.0|It's a bit hard to classify this movie:  it's basically a big-budget, dramatic retelling of the Cinderella story - minus the fairy godmothers or any supernatural element - aimed at young girls who fantasize about being princesses.<br /><br />There are many aspects of the film that are well-done, but the major problem with it is the lead actress, Drew Barrymore.  It's not that she can't act or doesn't look the part; it's her private life, the lurid details of which are now public knowledge (e.g., in rehab by age 13!).<br /><br />That being the case, it's virtually impossible to take her seriously as an innocent princess.  In fact, it's hard to sit through this movie and think of anything other than the irony -- even preposterousness -- of what you're watching.  Perhaps, the filmmakers reasoned, the silliness of this will be lost on the moppet audience to which the movie is geared.<br /><br />The chief merit of the film, I submit, is Anjelica Houston's chilling and utterly convincing performance as the evil step-mother.  The problem there, however, is that it's so well-done that the movie seems to depress you more than it uplifts you, which it does try to do at the end, when everything of course turns out all right.<br /><br />A net bummer, in other words.

Millions of women around the globe are subjugated and enslaved today.  The biggest problem is that they may not even realize their predicament and so it is hard to change their thinking.

B00000JPH6|2.0|It's hard for me to see how this movie is worth anybody's time these days.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Crystal\\" may have been big news back when it came out (in 1982), but it's hard to see what it has to offer anybody in the age of CGI and complete digitization.  It hasn't held up well.<br /><br />Set in another world, the story concerns the quest of an innocent elf-like creature who must return a crystal shard to its proper resting place in order to save the land.  There are no humans in this movie, only Muppet-like creatures.  (In case you don't know, this film is considered the masterwork of the two masterminds behind the Muppets, Jim Henson and Frank Oz.)<br /><br />Unfortunately for today's viewers, the technology available for breathing life into movie creatures has so comprehensively improved since this film was shot that the \\"Dark Crystal\\" cannot avoid showing its age at every turn.  Fatally, for a fantasy, it's simply impossible to lose yourself in the world the film attempts to create, since in nearly every shot you cannot get it out of your head that you are essentially looking at a bunch of puppets, or, occasionally, some guy in a mechanized costume.<br /><br />As for the story, I found it predictable and marvel at those who claim it is \\"imaginative.\\"  I award very low marks on originality:  nearly every story element had been done to death long before this movie saw the light of day.<br /><br />So who would like this movie?  Children, I guess, -- or perhaps somebody who seems to have an unnatural admiration for all things Muppet.<br /><br />But even then I have reservations.  The film is so dark, photographically as well as thematically, that it will probably bum you out for the day.  Even during those few moments when the sun in shining, the film still comes across as oppressively dark.  True, the directors attempt to relieve the gloom in the final ten seconds or so, but by then it's too little, too late.  So basically it's like muppets but without the fun.<br /><br />Heck, this movie might be unsuitable even for kids.  So unrelievedly grim and violent is it (stabbings, burnings, fallings to one's death) that it will probably give any kid under nine at least a couple of nightmares.<br /><br />There are plenty of kids' movies out there these days that also have something to say to adults, but not this one.  I cannot imagine anything appealing to adults in this movie, especially if you make the mistake of viewing the \\"making of\\" documentary, also on this DVD, which will completely breaks any spell the film had a chance at.<br /><br />As for the story, I paid strict attention but was needled by crippling questions.

0743455967|5.0|I personally do not write fiction and have no desire to write fiction.  I do write technical articles and I have a strong desire for them to be well written and interesting.  This was a valuable and enjoyable read even though I have never read a Stephen King novel.  I read a lot of fiction but I am not into the scary or sci-fi.      Mr. King's reputation alone warranted me reading this book.  You can go wrong when you study excellence!  The following take-aways from the book were very useful to me.      1.  \\"Good story ideas seen to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new under the sun.  Your job isn't to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up\\"  He then shares examples of how this worked in his life.  This is a very true statement so true in fact that you could almost substitute any word for story in the quote.  I have found the same to be true for business ideas.     2. \\"Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open.\\"  The message being don't seek criticism (including self criticism) when you are working on the first draft.  Complete it first.  Later in the book he states to let the first draft age (6 weeks) before going back to look at it again.      3. \\"You must not come lightly to the blank page.\\"  He states writing is serious and must be taken seriously.     4. \\"Construct your toolbox and bring it with you\\"  Some tools being vocabulary, grammar, form and style.      5. \\"The road to hell is paved with adverbs.\\"      6. \\"The paragraph not the sentence is the basic unit of writing.\\"     7.  \\"Good description usually consists of a few well chosen details that will stand for everything else.\\"      8. \\"Second draft equals first draft minus 10%.\\"      As someone who hated grammar in school and takes great pleasure in ignoring it as an adult, this book and Mr. King's examples have convinced me to stop ignoring it and embrace it.    This book is worth the read regardless of what kind of writing you do.    Dr. James T. Brown PMP PE CSP  Author - The Handbook of Program Management
B000WTNCYA|4.0|I bought this CD based on the strong buzz that it has been receiving.  That buzz turns out to be well-deserved.  This CD is as good as everyone says.  Gardot is a highly effective singer and a superb writer.  In ways that I did not anticipate, this turns out to be quite a sexy CD.  Highly recommended for people interested in intelligent singing and writing. The Norah Jones, Madeleine Peyroux, Diana Krall connection mentioned by others rings true to my ear.  Also recommended:  April Barrows.
157912626X|3.0|Miss Marple's second outing seems a trifle tired.  The writing appears forced at times, even repetitious, and there is too much foreshadowing.  The ending is a long time in coming and stretches credulity.  Not a bad book but certainly not in the same league with Agatha Christie's best works.
0385340567|4.0|Nothing to Lose is vintage Jack Reacher.  This time he's in Colorado, heading to San Diego from Calais, Maine.  The locals there pronounce it 'callous' and that speaks to part of Jack's character, the part that arises when he's challenged unnecessarily.  The 'challenger' here is Despair, CO, a few miles from Hope, CO, a few miles from Halfway, CO.  Despair is a company town.  It's also a pivotal element of the classic western plot in which the hero stumbles upon a boondock town in which everyone, especially the law, conspires against him.  The law in this case tells Jack to depart, forthwith, and for no apparent reason.  Jack is not one to follow irrational orders, particularly from individuals with no authority over him, and he sets out to discover the secret(s) of Despair, with the help of a policewoman from Hope.<br /><br />Lee Child's new novel points up his almost unique ability to take a simple plot with simple elements and turn it into a compelling, irresistibly insistent narrative.  By the time we reach the end we discover that things are far less simple than they appear.  They are also a bit too complex for plausibility's sake, but by then we are caught up in the wave and are carried to the powerful conclusion.<br /><br />Another strong outing for Jack.  While perhaps not his strongest, it is stronger than whatever's in second place.  Highly recommended.

0385340567|4.0|Jack Reacher is a drifter by choice.  He has spent the last 10 years seeing the country, sometimes by bus, and sometimes hitchhiking.  If you have followed the series, you know that he sometimes stops for a while and sometimes works for a while.  He travels light, with a folding toothbrush and the clothes on his back.<br /><br />This novel finds him in the neighboring towns of Hope and Despair in Colorado.  He had shown up in Despair because he was attracted by the name.  He only wanted to buy lunch and go on his way.  But the people in despair don't like strangers.  They refuse to sell him lunch, then kick him out of town as a vagrant.  That gets him both annoyed, and curious about the town.  He, of course, stays around and sticks his nose into things (also his fist).<br /><br />The plot may seem a little off-the-wall, but it is fiction.  You do have to wonder about small company towns where someone effectively owns the town.  Reacher, as usual, makes his own rules.  It is up to other people to clean up what he leaves behind.<br /><br />This novel will annoy some readers with the criticism of present US foreign policy and comments on religious extremists.  Expect the reviews to me mixed.<br /><br />The novel also deals with the issue of obligations to a spouse \\"Til death do us part,\\" as well as environmental issues and issues of safe working environments.  There is also a side issue on the treatment of people who are incapacitated.
0553573403|4.0|If you read a lot of fantasy, please take note: A Game of Thrones and its sequels are different. You wouldn't guess it from the opening, which seems typical. But afterward, as the story plods on, you'll begin to wonder if Martin forgot that he's writing a fantasy.<br /><br />Lots of kings and queens and lords and more knights that you can possibly remember, it's a mental strain trying to keep up with who is who and why we should care. In fact the whole first half of the novel is very slow moving,  mostly plots of political intrigue set upon a stark medieval stage. But just when you've sorted out who the heroes are, Martin goes for the surprise gut-punch. You'll know it when you get there. All of the sudden you'll think, \\"Oh my god. What is going on here?\\"<br /><br />Martin is a huge enthusiast of knighthood. He collects knights in his house and builds large battle scenes with castles and war equipment. He gave me a little plastic knight once, which sits atop my desk reminding me that his knights are not the heroes other fantasy authors make them out to be. They rape, they murder, they cheat, they steal, they curse, they plunder, and they war, war, war.<br /><br />His mastery of the Dark Ages is brought to bear within a fantasy setting, and you really feel you are living in a very nasty and violent world where no one is sacred and anything can happen. Good guys are bad, and bad guys are worse, and many of them are children (by modern standards). Martin will tease you down a safe path for a very long time, investing your interest, giving you hope, and then teach you a lesson for being so gullible. You'd think that would piss you off, but like drinking hard liquor: you wince, you gasp, and ask for more. He chops formulaic fantasy into pieces and assembles a monster you can't stop reading.<br /><br />Please be warned: this is an ADULT fantasy. This is not Peter S. Beagle you're reading. Martin cuts to the bone (and other internal stuff) with his use of sex and violence, and has no problem sticking your face down in it... Because that was the way of things a thousand years ago, in our own cruel, cruel world, the time on which most classic fantasy is based but with literary sweetener. Martin ads no sweetener to his epic. You'll find no knights in shining armor here. Well, that's not quite true, but they're not as clean as they look. And woe to Martin's damsels: \\"distress\\" doesn't even begin to explain their part.<br /><br />Like Robert Jordan, you will have to exercise some real memory skills to keep track of the multitude of characters. But you get used to the characters he generally deals with so that he can shock you with them. That is Martin's strength: he likes to keep you just a little off balance, a little unsure. After the first few novels you will be stripped of confidence in who will win or lose, and who will live or die.<br /><br />So if you like a gritty form of knighthood in your fantasy, be patient, read on. The immediate two sequels are even better.our face down in it...

B000002C25|4.0|Way, way back when this album first surfaced ('97?), I was an impressionable young adult, and made the mistake of believing what I read; in this case a Rolling Stone review.<br /><br />If I recall correctly, they basically said that Oasis has gotten too big for their britches, and this is what happens when a band has too much money and too much coke. I remember that part. I couldn't make it up.<br /><br />A month ago I bought the CD again. It's amazing. So many people hated and wanted to destroy Oasis. Sure, they were cocky as all get out, but they DELIVERED the goods.<br /><br />Hey, could AT&T be wrong? \\"All Around the World\\" is a brilliant telecommunications jingle. I also love many other songs on this album, basically all of them. I would even say I listen to it more than \\"What's the Story...\\". That's my two cents (or pence). I'll never believe Rolling Stone so naively again.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|My wife is a HUGE fan of Medium.  When Amazon ran a sale on TV show DVD sets a few weeks ago, I knew this would be a great gift for her.  She has enjoyed watching the episodes so much, I will be buying the second season for her soon, even if it is not on sale.  There are some nice special features on the disks - commentaries, alternate pilot episode, etc. - but she was just happy to have the episodes.  If there is any complaint about the set, it is that the menus are not the easiest to navigate - it's sometimes hard to tell what episode you are selecting.  The \\"OFF/ON\\" highlights for commentaries seem to be reversed - \\"ON\\" is bright when actually \\"OFF\\" is selected.  Once you get used to the quirks, though, the set is still worth it.
B00005JKCH|5.0|The '02 cinematic release `Spider-Man' is simply one of the best comic book superheroes ever to make the leap to the silver screen. It has it all; super special effects and action sequences, just the right touch of comedy and a sweet high school romance all rolled into one fast moving, highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire makes for the perfect Peter Parker (sorry, just had to string those three P's together), timid high school science geek turned powerful, costumed superhero. With the addition of Kristen Dunst in the role of next door neighbor and love interest Mary Jane Watson, James Franco and Willem Defoe as the notorious Green Goblin this is a film that can be viewed and enjoyed again and again!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is by far one of the most romantic Jane Austen adaptations to date.  My daughter and I were very pleasantly surprised at how much we love this version. Before seeing it, the Amanda Root \\"Persuasion\\" was our favorite and now----this one has taken first place, although the other version is right behind it on our list.  It's too bad that some of the reviewers discounted this movie, mostly because of the last scenes.  It would be a shame if some Jane Austen lovers decided not to give this movie a try based on those reviews.  This is an excellent movie and any Jane Austen fan will love it!
B00005JPFH|3.0|The third and most likely the last of the Spider-Man saga starring Tobey Maguire came to an end with the '07 release of `Spider-Man 3'.This film didn't live up to the expectations of Spidey fans for several reasons, the one most often mentioned is the numerous bad guys muddied the plot and eliminated and opportunity to further explore the psyche of the man behind the mask.<br /><br />A further annoyance to his fan base was that the plot itself was designed to expose and amplify the darkside of Peter Parker's personality which was a dangerous risk for the filmmakers to take since it deprived the audience of the shy, nerdish persona that everyone loved and could relate to.<br /><br />To be honest I hated this film upon my first viewing and couldn't wait for it to end. However after taking a second look at it with new eyes I discovered that it was actually quite good, just different. Admittedly not as good as the first two but still worth a watch or two.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.
B00005JPS8|5.0|You don't need to be a Marvel fan or even a comic fan at all in order to appreciate the exiting adventure that is Iron Man. It's got the excitement, danger, and the touch of romance that represents the \\"good movie\\", all with a lead actor that knows what he's doing.    But the best part about Iron Man, I observed while watching for the second time, is not even the action or the overall plot of the movie, as phenomenal as they are. For me, there's nothing better in the world than a main character that undergoes genuine change, a character you actually care about through and through! Tony Stark is as well-rounded a character as can be, one moment making you laugh and another bringing tears to your eyes through his self realizations, risks, and of course his banter with his personal assistant, the \\"famous\\" Pepper Pots.     So, in summary, if you want to watch a movie where you actually care about the characters and the plot resolution, Iron Man is your best bet.

067003830X|5.0|I've been reading other recent books about amazing recent neurological work.  This one stands out for the degree to which it puts that work in a broader and more useful perspective on what it all means for everyone's future ways of learning, training and healing.  Doidge even makes me see finally why psychiatry still holds Freud in such high esteem, and how what is supposed to go on in psychotherapy can be understood in much the same positive way as we view the effects of psychoactive drugs and cognitive behavioral therapies that have demonstrable success.  \\"Plasticity\\" is Doidge's key concept and he uses it well to link conventional wisdoms of learning to biologically-based refinements on them.  More than anything I've read recently, this book tells me we're discovering the mechanisms behind how genes and experience combine, and that clinicians are actually putting these discoveries to work.

The Kung Fu series and other such types of series are long gone with the past.  This show was about a boy who became a real man - a man that cared for others, believed in leading a simple spiritual life, and dealt with a world filled with people who had warped ideas of what a real man was.  The series was great - even my teenage kids are hooked on it.  The behind the scene stuff is very interesting and the spiritual beliefs of the Shaolin Temple and Priests are inspiring.  Well done production - highly recommend.  Can't wait until I get the next season.

B0006Z2KX4|5.0|This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again. The chemistry between Grant and Hepburn creates a perfect foil for the snappy dialogue interspersed amongst somewhat silly but completely engaging situations.     Movies from this era understand that every character matters, that they add the spice to the movie. Hence, the constable, the gardener and even the dog add to the overall screwball energy. Movies today don't seem to pay that much attention to such small details.     Hepburn is delightful. In fact, the first time I gave it to my younger brother to watch he absolutely fell in love with her. Her distinctive voice works to her advantage here as the flighty but well meaning Susan Vance. Her incredible energy and innocent machinations add depth to a character which could've descended into stereotype and annoyance if not infused with Hepburn's considerable charm.     Grant is, of course, letter perfect in a role that turns his leading man suave reputation on its head. Instead of the smooth Cary Grant, we are pleasantly surprised by his David, a nerd and rather bumbling, which offers great opportunity to bump up against the insanity of Susan, though by the end of the movie one realizes that she's not only drawn him from his shell, but allowed him to recognize that the very ordered existance he had set up with the very controlled Miss Swallow was not the answer to his dreams as he once thought.     If you wish to watch a textbook, delightful, adorable and engaging screwball comedy, I highly recommend this one as the epitome of the genre. Not to be missed.

B00144VBBS|5.0|This album is excellent & covers Toby Keith's entire career. It has all his great hit songs & I am enjoying it. Also like the new single- \\"She's a Hottie\\", a song to entertain & have fun with.Toby is a great singer/songwriter/entertainer with a strong resonant voice. Thanks for allowing me to review this album.  Harriet Abusaid
B0007OY2MG|5.0|This was a great product. I wasnt sure about buying it used, but it turned out to be great. I bought it for my sister for her birthday and she hasnt had any problems out of it, it works great!
B000EWBKKI|1.0|Don't bother with this Blu-Ray edition of the movie if you already have the DVD.  It's a poor transfer that barely looks any better.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This was recorded around the time I was born, but it truly is timeless. So few artists span across multiple generations, but Carole King is one of them. I never get tired of listening to this album and no matter how I feel on any given day, something about her voice combined with the lyrics, leaves me with a sense of well being.

The leather binding makes it look so exquisite and elegant.  I have never read any of Austen's novels so I hope this book will withstand my man-handling of it!  LOL<br />I'll keep an eye out for the spelling mistakes but that shouldn't be too big of a deal as long as I can still understand what's going on.  The gold edging is also quite lovely.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|\\"Lord of War\\" is a wake up call for all people; it is a movie that emotionally effects the viewer and spotlights the reality of war that the mass media, educational systems, and social structure do not want you to understand.  The first time I viewed this movie I found myself in complete disbelief that Hollywood had actually been able to release this film, because it is the ultimate \\"Reality\\" show: so truthful it is scary.  In fact, without the cynical, often gut-wrenching, humor, the film would be \\"too real\\" to consider \\"entertainment.\\"  I believe that it is this \\"ultra realism\\" that has lead to reviews that are, as stated by another reviewer, NAIVE--or cynical at best.  That there are more reviews with four or fewer stars attests to the inability/refusal of viewers to pay attention to what they are watching.  \\"Lord of War\\" is definitely not pure, unabashed indulgence of one's senses, but a film that requires listening and watching--engaging the film; not passing the time.<br /><br />As a former Combat Engineer Officer who was \\"courted\\" more than a few times by \\"gun buyers\\" and mercenaries--no I never got involved--I can assure you, like Robert D. Steele in his review, I have seen it all; and to the degree that I was ordered to abandon and bury weapons, ammunitions, and other military equipment, I was an unwilling participant in bringing war to others.<br /><br />The script is superb; the acting is so seamless, that it is easy to see how other reviewers describe the acting as something short of completely poor performances.  Again, Robert D. Steele puts it most succinctly: \\"This is a first rate movie with some truly extraordinary visuals and some truly extraordinary lines.\\"  It is unfortunate that politics, personal beliefs, and a general lack of interest in understanding the world we live in must overwhelm potential viewer's interest, and thereby distract or prevent them from viewing, such a distinctly unique and powerful movie as \\"Lord of War.\\"  When you watch the film, instead of thinking there is no way it could happen, stop and ask yourself: If this is really happening, what does it mean to me, my family, and my friends--not to mention nation?  Then look at the research and the facts out there, and you will see that \\"Lord of War\\" is truly entertainment (at its' best) imitating reality; that \\"Lord of War\\" is a movie you can watch over and over as a reality check that entertains and engages you, the viewer.<br /><br />Additionally, the 2-Disc Special Edition provides documentary follow-up to the statements and information made in the movie.  While these features were not \\"news\\" to me, they have proven very beneficial for helping others who view the film as \\"too far fetched to be true,\\" despite their keen awareness of my past and knowledge of such events.  They definitely add to the credibility of the movie for many.  So, hopefully, more people will be encouraged to venture into true \\"reality,\\" and view this film--either for the first time, or with a \\"new\\" understanding of what the \\"Lord of War\\" is about.<br /><br />Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

0385340567|1.0|I've been a Child/Reacher fan throughout the series, but in this unfortunate effort Child stumbles badly.<br /><br />Briefly, while hitchhiking through Colorado, Reacher finds himself thrown out of the town of Despair for reasons he can't fathom. Naturally this gets his back up, and he decides to make the point that he can't be thrown out of ANY town.<br /><br />Just like in David Morrell's seminal Rambo novel \\"First Blood\\".<br /><br />Along the way he has an affair with a cop from the neighboring town of Hope; uncovers a couple of conspiracies revolving around the Iraq war, Christian fundamentalists, and Army deserters; and basically tears up the scenery.<br /><br />Reacher has always been an existential, somewhat nihilistic, central character. But there were certain cornerstones of his character that were fundamental and appealing. An inviolate sense of justice, and a willingness to go to any lengths to help an oppressed underdog.<br /><br />None of that pertains in this novel, which serves more as a soapbox from which Child preaches his own political views, views which seem to conflict with those we've come to associate with Reacher himself. In this book, Reacher -- himself a former career Army MP officer -- has suddenly become anti-military and anti-war. Jangling and disconcerting, to say the least.<br /><br />Further, there's no clarity to the story itself. The people of the town of Despair act in unbelievable concert, and their motivation for doing so is never explained in the book. They're almost like the zombies in \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".<br /><br />The twin towns of Hope and Despair seem to exist in a void in the landscape, isolated physically and -- apparently -- functionally from the rest of the state. The few residents of Hope whom we meet in the book all seem to know something bad is going on in Despair, but no one -- including the cops -- does anything about it. Not the cops, not the people; no one even bothers to notify the state authorities, evidently. It's as if this little part of Colorado exists in a vacuum. Very Twilight Zone.<br /><br />As far as execution, there's a lot of Reacher going back and forth between Hope and Despair -- how metaphorical, I'm sure -- and it's boring, frankly. Further, the \\"science\\" of some of the aspects of the book is just plain wrong, as is Child's description of some aspects of US Army organization -- a flaw you'd think Child would be able to avoid with a little basic research, which you'd think he'd have done if his central character's an ex-Army officer.<br /><br />The success of the Reacher novels in the past has been somewhat formulaic, but it's an appealing formula: Reacher stumbles onto a situation in which an innocent is being victimized by an evil person. They're stories about justice ultimately prevailing, but they're also, at their core, small stories. This is appropriate and believable for a Lone Ranger-type figure like Jack Reacher.<br /><br />In this book Child is trying to have Reacher take on an entire system, and it doesn't wash at all. A bad case of over-Reaching (sorry; I couldn't help myself).a vacuum. Very Twilight Zone.

B0016HNOXQ|1.0|I've been listening to Portishead for well over 10 years now and I never get tired of hearing Dummy, Roseland, or their self titled CD over and over again. I don't have enough fingers to count the number of people I have turned on to this band. I love their music so much! They always put me in the best, chilled-out mood.     In all honesty, this CD sucks so bad that I threw it away.     I know that they were trying to do something different from their norm, and they did just that. If you liked any of their previous albums, I just don't see how you could enjoy this new stuff. The only people that might like this CD, are people that don't know Portishead or people that like terrible noise.      I, like many others, was very excited to hear that they were coming out with a new album. What a dissapointment it was to hear how much damage 10 years time could do to a band.    DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!

0316067601|5.0|This book starts by taking you inside the U.S. Navy SEALs training program in Coronado. You are with Marcus Luttrell throughout BUD/S and Hell Week. You fly with him and his teammates in a C-130 to the Hindu Kush. We then follow U.S. Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell as he vividly recounts this 2005 maneuver he led against Al Qaeda operatives along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan. There are many details of the fierce mountain battle that led to the loss of Luttrell's three comrades and describes his own escape, capture, and rescue. The book does have courage, violence and strong language.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is one of those movies everyone will like one way or another. It has the historical appeal, lush sets and costumes, an all-star cast and a wonderfully evil plot. What strikes me most about this movie is how the conflicts and plights of these characters still exist today, and to a great extent. It is a very watchable, yet moody film, the one I am sure I will watch again.<br />The semi-true story centers on two sisters, Anne and Mary Boleyn. Mary (Scarlett Johansson), although she is younger, gets married first and settles into the country lifestyle she is fond of. This leaves Anne (Natalie Portman) eligible to become King Henry's (Eric Bana) mistress, but once he arrives to the country, he falls for Mary rather than Anne. Much to the disapproval of their mother (Kristin Scott Thomas), their father and uncle ship them off to the court of England, where Mary is to become King's mistress, despite her marriage. However, Anne is the head-strong sister who won't be happy until she has made a life for herself, and from then on, the sisters combat each other, the King's wife and fatal ambitions.<br />Although Bana and Johansson give satisfactory performances, it is Portman who is the heart and soul of this movie. Her portrayal of the woman who is responsible for the English Reformation is both seductive and profound. Also, Kieran McGuigan's cinematography is wonderful, and kudos to Peter Morgan, whose screenplay captures the time and place wonderfully. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a wonderful, engaging movie you will love.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|A well written companion piece that stands quite well on it's own two feet(so to speak.)
B0014KD46W|4.0|Some reviewers have said that if you like Traffic and Blind Faith, you'll like this. That's true, but I find Steve Winwood's new album to be much more complicated than that. It does have Traffic and Blind Faith moments, but they are moments in a much bigger picture. There are ghosts from his entire career here along with fresh new work as well. I find the title very fitting. All his past lives are represented along with his new 9th life. Almost every song is different; mood, instruments, etc.. which I find very refreshing for someone at this point of his career. AND his voice is right there! Amazingly it's held up INCREDIBLY well!! Unfortunately that's not always the case. He sounds great. Out of the nine songs on this CD there are two I don't love. That's why I give it four stars instead of five. If you truly like Steve Winwood, you'll like this!

0671027344|5.0|this was a great book. it's one of those ones where you just love the main character. charlie's in grade 9, a smart kid with no friends, and this book follows charlie's life through a series of letters he writes to us the readers.<br /><br />what i think i love about charlie is his honesty in his approach to the world. he seems somewhat unconnected, and is as he has no friends to peer pressure him at the beginning of the story, so he views people at school from an outsiders perspective. he never sounds persecuted though (as you would have to be emotionally involved to be persecuted, and charlie is almost estranged from his own life, being the wallflower and all) he just reports the events in his life with an earnestness that makes you want the best for him. he talks about both touchy subjects and regular 'growing up' issues and approaches these with a cautious nervousness, though at the same time he's... i guess he chooses an opinion and then sticks with that conviction. he makes me smile, i want to hug him. i really got emotionally attached to him, when he experiences something good, i'm really happy for him. i think i teared up a bit when he kissed that girl.<br /><br />anyways, charlie's problem is that he has no presence in his own life. he is a wallflower in his own life, so much so that he writes us these letters so that the reader has a larger presence vicariously in his life than he does himself. there is one scene when he's the dj at a party, and he gauges the mood of the party so well that he accurately picks out songs to reflect that mood. he's very 'other' focused, too selfless. there's a potential reason for this at the end, though it is debatable as to how much of this is just his personality as opposed to a response to something else.<br /><br />this is a great book with a great character.
0790737345|5.0|This is a definate chick flick but it's a good one.  I love the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage in here.  She plays a Dr and he's an Angel who sees her in the hospital where she works.  She can see him but he doesn't let her know his secret.  The only way their relationship can grow is if he leaves his 'life' as an angel.  He can leave the life of no death, pain and sadness, and trade it for a normal life that humans experience.    They both act really well in this and it was good to see Meg in a more serious role.  I cannot go into more depth without giving you the ending, but I have to stress that this is such a beautiful movie (ok a little depressing in parts) but overall so good.  You will most probably need tissues; it never fails to make me cry.  It's such a beautiful romantic story and an under-rated movie for sure.  I love it and it's one of my all time favourites.  PS  I love Megs curls in this.
0375714669|2.0|The first novel in this series succeeded because its childlike graphics and gee-whiz storytelling matched perfectly with this subject matter. We could imagine the infant/child author telling her story in exactly these terms.<br />This sequel fails because the issues of growing up and dealing with the disillusionment with one's own culture are much more subtle. The story and the graphics remind us constantly of the nuances that are left out, of the issues of women's rights and humanity that are sentimentalized, of the real conflicts that this child/woman is undergoing that are completely unexplored.<br />There are a few quibbles to be explored: the view of vienna is odd and the little vignette of the narrator peeing standing up seems forced. But most importantly, the mismatch between the story and the way in which it is told ends up making for a read that turns boring quickly.
0345347951|4.0|I have read many of the latter works by Clarke, and I find them imaginative, intelligent and thought-provoking. So when I turned my attention to some of his early works, Childhood's End came very highly recommended, and I'm glad to say it lives up to almost all its high praise.<br /><br />Though presented as a novel, this could easily be three short stories, dealing with three different subjects: contact, utopia and apocalypse.  In fact, the book is divided into three parts, which are bound together by a century of life on Earth following humanity's first contact with an alien race called the Overlords.  The first two parts are vintage Clarke: a chilling and suspenseful depiction of first encounter laced with clues that will keep any reader guessing at just what might come next and who are these \\"benevolent\\" Overlords.  The second part describes a utopia that for all intents and purposes has humanity feeling content with itself. As with all utopias in science fiction, we know what to expect next... and do we ever get it.<br /><br />[Spoilers]<br />However it is here that the story takes a strange and anti-climatic twist. In short, all that was obtained by the grace of the Overlords, all of mankind's population, and even the Earth itself is entirely eradicated simply to fuel the next evolutionary step for humanity.  On one end Clarke, stresses the fact that humans are quite insignificant and not \\"meant of the stars\\" and yet just a few pages later mankind's offspring can gobble up their home planet while undergoing their ascendance to the next plane of existence. Not only has this evolutionary step no biological basis, but it is heavily steeped with religious and paranormal implication, the first of which were summarily denied in the first part of the book by the Overlords.  Despite all the hints and clues that Clarke purposefully scatters throughout the book about the Overlords, their appearance, and their true intentions, in the end it is humans themselves who inevitably destroy everything; not because of misguided intentions or horrendous mistakes, but simply to fulfill their destiny. The author heavily emphasizes that this is a good way to go, but I find many logical pitfalls in this conclusion.  Besides the ones listed above, another glaring one is the destruction of the Earth and all its life, which could have produced other species that eventually become capable of reaching this much-desired enlightenment that humans attained.  Clarke gets most of these problems sorted out by his later works, but Childhood's End, while being very imaginative is very raw and heavily influenced by the general outlook and political mind-set of its decade.<br /><br />A classic worthy of reading? Certainly.<br /><br />But a masterpiece?...not quite.ything; not because of misguided intentions or horrendous mistakes, but simply to fulfill their destiny.

0375701427|1.0|Have you ever known someone who, for example, has just gone through a bad break-up, and out of kindness you sit there for hours as you listen to the person's obsessive, often irrational ranting on one overemphasized detail blamed for the break-up when you only want to slap the person back to their senses?  That's how I felt reading \\"American Pastoral.\\"  You might say that's the point -- trying to capture the obsessive mindset of someone enduring such a tragedy which felt kind of silly to be honest -- but it didn't work for me.  This was a short story filled out with repetitive inner monologue and description so intrusive at times and both so rambling that it went on to the point Roth would stick a break in and restart the scene because even he knew there's no chance anybody could remember what the scene was about.  I just wanted to slap him until he understands that we need more than that, even if it's not a plot-driven story!  And the huge blocks of text didn't help.  Doesn't Roth know that not breaking dialogue exchanges onto separate lines stopped being \\"in\\" like 50 years ago?  For that, as well as what to me were bland characters I couldn't sympathize with, no spine or structure, and no resolution, I have to question whether Roth knows how to write for a modern audience.  It's no surprise that, as inexplicanly critically acclaimed as this book is, it hasn't been adapted into a film and probably never will be: it's simply not entertaining and I don't feel like I took anything away from it besides a desire to avoid Roth at all costs from now on.  So why did I read it then, when the book was so frustratingly dull I felt I could die?  Like a lot of people writing negative reviews, I was duped into it by its Pulitzer Prize sticker.

0439813786|5.0|I loaned my copy of this book to a 5th grade to get their opinions. They groaned at the sight of the book because it was so long. I suggested they look inside before they make any final decisions. I asked them to pay particular attention to the illustrations. Ah....they didn't expect illustrations in a long novel. Once they got over the sight of a really, really long book, they read and read and talked about the book and recommended it to others. I was so pleased to see them not sharing the ending until everyone who wanted to read the book had done so. The kids were so thrilled with the book, they donated money and bought a copy for the school's library.<br /><br />I personally was enthralled with the story in the text and the story in the illustrations. The art work was akin to watching a movie. Fantastic experience for me as a reader and as a teacher of literature.
B00004TJKI|5.0|I was recommended this film as one of only a handful of films that adequately depicts real-life courtroom \\"skirmishes\\".  Though the film rarely deviates from actual criminal procedures, the excellent screenplay and direction still delivers a fantastic, attention-grabbing thriller.  The acting is superb (how could it be otherwise with exellent and hardworking Jimmy Stewart headlining) and the movie's pace keeps you vitally interested.  This is one of my favorite movies.

B0001HAISG|5.0|Another reviewer, Mr Barnabo I think it was, had it perfectly right. This is the best and most faithful PETER PAN ever. Jeremy Sumpter, precisely on the cusp of adolescence, with his masculine hands and feet, his androgynous face and figure, and his athletic accomplishment as Pan, realizes for the screen just what Mr Barrie imagined. Wendy and all the cast are equally perfect in their roles. As an aside, I would point out that although Savanarola might have thought some characters scantilly dressed, there is NO nudity, child or otherwise, and this film is safe fore anyone's children, whether they be of Puritan stock or Unitarian agnostics. Like any library where books like Peter Pan might reside on the bookshelf, this DVD can be returned to periodically. I cannot tell you how many times I have viewed Philadelphia Story or Bringing Up Baby, for example, and so my main reason for this review is a plea for the Blu-ray release. Despite owning this DVD, now that I have an HD widescreen TV, I want this on Blu-ray! Please!!!
B0016BP0PW|2.0|This isn't a polished review per se. Just wanted to throw in that the movie is a bit long and often sappy. My friends and I lost it during the second half and were put off by overly emphasized psychedelic scenes of the hippies getting high. It just went on and on and on....
B0013URJTG|5.0|I'm a fairly new PT fan, having consumed myself with purchasing virtually the entire catalog in the last 4 months after hearing \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\". I think \\"Lightbulb\\" is another excellent PT CD filled with all the great musical styles I've noticed in all other PT offerings. I love the fact that this one has a lot of acoustic guitar-based songs that morph into more intricate. electronically infuenced tunes.  Steve Wilson's ability for balancing out heavy, almost metal guitar parts within the structure of multi-layered mellow compositions is a very appealing part of PT's musical style to me and is evident throughout this album on songs like \\"Lightbulb\\":, \\"Hatesong\\", and \\"Russia on Ice\\".  \\"Feel so Low\\" is also a favorilte of mine: a slow reflective piece very much reminding me of \\"Collapse the Light into Earth\\" from \\"Absentia\\".    This CD is a must for all PT fans who enjoy them for their musical versatility and commitment to instrumentally influenced music.
B00154GEFU|5.0|If Asia's first album is one of the greatest debuts for a band, Phoenix is one of the best reunions. It is a dream come true for this long time Asia fan. Sure the John Payne era produced some great works (most noteably Aura and Silent Nation), but a return of the original was always hoped for. As I still listen to the classic Asia and Alpha albums, I know in 25 years Phoenix will continue to be played.
1400063515|1.0|Actually I love this book and can't get enough Taleb, mostly additionally, in the form of podcasts. I just couldn't help but posting a comment on the quality of the paper and the binding. Especially a book like this which is full of fascinating facts and figures you're going to want to put your finger on later, you might be inclined to highlight, right? The ink bleeds right through the paper to the other side. How frustrating. I buy hardbacks knowing that the paperback paper is too thin to highlight. Is this how it's going to be now? There are other indications of cost cutting. The binding ripping after one reading. Inside cover full of bubbles where the glue didn't quite catch. Especially with a Black Swan of a blockbuster hit, couldn't you spend the extra couple of cents to make a quality product?
0060837551|5.0|I bought my 1st copy of The Thorn Birds 5 years ago. It was a smaller paperback, and its a book I read every year. When I bought it, it was 2nd-hand, and had seen many readings before I had it. This year, after the years it had spent with me, it finally fell apart, past the point of all repair. So, I invested in a new copy. I grew up watching the mini-series, and since high school I've read the book about every year. Its a timeless classic, and a story I've loved most of my whole life! Few stories have come so vividly alive like this one has, both on the page of a book and on film.<br /><br />Own this book, read this book! You won't be disappointed!
0446402389|5.0|Sure, it's a terrific police procedural, but it's the historical setting which really gives this book it's edge.    In Stalinist Russia murder does not exist, at least according to communist theory. Murder, according to these rules, is only possible in the west, with its inequities between people. Yet a small body is found in Moscow, the mangled body of a small boy. His stomach has been removed and what appears to be dirt is stuffed in his mouth.    The authorities refuse to consider that this might be a murder. They want the incident put down to accident.     The background of Communism is what keeps you turning page after page.   The author manages to convey a sense of smothering fear.       Much recommended.

B000YAA68C|5.0|All of the other reviewers have said it much better than I could ever hope to..but I just want to point out that this is the type of movie that is 100 times more valuble, human and meaningful than all of the 'special effects' and 'sex for the sake of sex' garbage that Hollywood keeps turning out...Like Notebook, August Rush, What Dreams May Come, Heart and Souls and Freedom Writers this film enriches the viewers sense of humanity...a true treasure
B000058983|4.0|Love-Forever Changes ****<br /><br />So I had heard the album a few times from friends and family but never bought it for myself because while I loved most of the album there where parts of the album that left me cold, and honestly still do. However to say that this is an important piece of 1960's culture and L.A. legend would simply be a great understatement. With Forever Changes Arthur Lee and the gang totally encapsulated the feeling and images of the movement going on at the time and it is nothing short of a bizarre beauty.<br /><br />'Alone Again Or' is accessible and easy going, yet deprived off life which makes it amazing. 'A House Is Not A Motel' is in short one of the most perfect songs this reviewer has ever heard. 'Maybe The People Would Be The Times Or Between Clark And Hilldale' adds new flavor to the album with flamenco guitars, Santana like rhythms before they even were, and a wonderful horn chart. I think this song more than any other represents the variety that was L.A. at the time. The rest of the album is good to say the least with two exceptions.<br /><br />'Live And Let Live' is hippie-yuppie at it's worst, the message is nice and all but I can do with out. Though all is not lost as there is a pretty great guitar solo. 'AndMoreAgain' is one of the most pretentious things I have ever heard and it plays like a bad Moody Blues tune.<br /><br />Over all it could have been better but even still it is the classic that everyone raves about, and it truly is an album you can get lost in very easily. As for the bonus tracks, this could have done with out. They are mostly just alternate mixes that don't sound much different and the new tracks don't add anything really new, so just stick with the standard release.
B001AG52AG|1.0|This movie is all over the place.  If you haven't read the book you wouldn't know what was going on.  I recommend you pick up the book and let your imagination run wild.
0316143472|3.0|I have read all of David's books and was eagerly awaiting the \\"new\\" one.<br />I'm not sorry I purchased it but I was disappointed that it was bland and<br />repetitive of past material. I think he is in a comfort zone of middle<br />age and it is starting to show. He has money, his homes, his partner and<br />there are only so many ways you can present a childhood memory. The latter half of the book that deals with a move to Japan------the Japanese<br />language class is exactly like his previous French language class. OK-<br />we get it..you aren't good at learning languages (like most people). The<br />Normandy town living is repetitive and who can \\"drag\\" out trying to quit<br />smoking into several chapters?  A tad boring. I will be curious and cautious about purchasing the next \\"new\\" book by this author.
B000244FDW|4.0|very long series which is good lots of detail.  I like Elizabeth character but not her sister Jane.  Because Jane is a brunette!  I always imagined her to be blonde.ALso the Mr Darcy character is NOT\\"\\"FANCY ENOUGH TO TEMPT ME LOL\\"\\"He doesnt smile and is not handsome.  a bit boring and cant act.  Otherwise the series is nicely done with very good surroundings.
B00139W3NE|5.0|This is one review that will upset a lot of people (hopefully) To me the Magisterium represents the Liberal Establishment that has been seeking to brain wash the youth of America for decades...  Establishing Polticial Correctness is another form of censorship...It is rampant in the public schools where the teaching of United States History is watered down to nothing...Where only the teaching of Evolution and Global Warming are allowed...Where the make up of college faculties consists of over 90% liberal thought and teachers who put forth the possibilty of Intelligent Design and contradict Al Gore's lies about Global Warming are fired....Where conservative guest speakers are shouted down....  All of this is to destroy the belief in Idividualistic Capitalism so the All Powerful State can control the economy and the national thought process and Government takes the place of God...  No one can control a people who believe that the spiritual nature of man is paramount so faith in God must be destroyed...  Needless to say, I love this film...Even though I see things that the producers probably did not intend....
B00139W3NE|2.0|First, the visual effects were pretty weak. Think \\"Made for TV\\" movie and thats about right.    Second, the story seems to stop and start. Very disjointed. You'll spend 15 minutes hiding in a cupboard listening to some drawn out monologue and then \\"a miracle occurs\\" and the heroine is in the next scene. There is little flow to the film, its almost like the scenes were their own episodes with only the thinnest transitions.    Third, talk about preachy. Big bad Magisterium controls everyone and everything and is harming children only opposed by the last \\"light\\" of the world, a college. Yeah, ok. I mean we all know that colleges are beacons of enlightenment, I mean the frat parties are BRILLIANT. Come on, I'd like my indoctrination to have a modicum of sanity.    Bottomline. This is one movie the kids will yawn at and parents will roll their eyes through. Skip it.
0385504217|5.0|For a while I resisted reading this book, thinking that it could not possibly be as good as its hype. Well, I was wrong. This is simply one terrific book that will keep the reader riveted to its pages until the very last one is turned. It is a very well-written, intricately plotted thriller in which a great number of esoteric historical facts and interesting theories of a religious nature are woven. Those who read it should, first and foremost, keep in mind that this book is simply a work of fiction.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose when Jacques Sauniere, the elderly and revered curator of the Louvre, is murdered inside the museum. The crime scene and the body itself are laden with symbols and cryptic messages pointing to renowned Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon. He is invited to the crime scene by the wily Captain Bezu Fache, of the Central Directorate Judicial Police, the French equivalent of our Federal Bureau of Investigation, ostensibly to assist the police. Little does Langdon know that he is, in fact, the prime suspect.<br /><br />When he meets police cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, they join forces. They are then led on a merry chase by a series of riddles and ciphers that are ground in a historical context. They are always just one step of the French police, who seem determined to charge Langdon with the murder of Jacques Sauniere. During their voyage of discovery, Langdon and Sophie come across a secret society, the Priory of Sion, that has a startling list of former members, which list includes Leonardo Da Vinci, as well as the late Jacques Sauniere. There is also some interesting historical detail about the ancient Knights Templar, as well as Opus Dei, a conservative religious organization currently in existence.<br /><br />Langdon and Sophie peel back layers of historical clues that point to a secret of such magnitude that some would kill for it. As Langdon and Sophie surreptitiously travel from France to England and seem to be headed closer to the heart of the mystery that they are trying to unravel, an unknown nemesis is closer to them than they would dare imagine. This unknown adversary is marshaling resources in order to obtain the long hidden secret that Langdon and Sophie appear to be on the brink of discovering. It is one that has the potential to have earth shattering implications.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, plot driven, rather than character driven, thriller. It hurls itself into the reader's consciousness at break-neck speed, and before the reader realizes it, the book holds the reader in its thrall: hook, line, and sinker. For those readers who love historical detail and unusual facts and coincidences, this is definitely a fascinating book that will hold their interest. It is a page-turning thriller in which nearly every chapter leaves the reader on the brink of a precipice. The book is written in clear, effortless prose, which makes the most esoteric historical details surprisingly easy to understand. Simple in its presentation but intricate in its plotting, it is no surprise that this book has become a runaway, international bestseller.

B000RO9VJK|5.0|I have been a business owner for 8 years. I feel this powerful book has changed my life. All the time I spent working \\"in\\" my business, I had no clue how to work on it. The wisdom in the book has given my business a second chance.    I urge all people thinking about starting their own business to read this book as well as other books on how to create business processes and procedures. I also recommend \\"Your Marketing Sucks\\" for those who need to understand what not to do to promote your business.     I would have saved so much time AND LOTS OF MONEY had I spent even a few months educating myself on how to run a business. Take time to plan and educate yourself. So many businesses do fail before their tenth birthday. Mine almost did.
B000TGCR38|3.0|I struggled with this review. I know the Holocaust was as bad as this movie portrays. I have watched most movies out there on WWII. The acting was very good and the plot very complex. The scene everyone is upset about with the hair coloring did not bother me so much as a Jewish woman whould have to do what she did to pass as Arian.<br /><br />It is just very brutal/sexual. So much shooting and blood and the final horrid thing where the hero is stripped and waste is poured over her was just too much for me to stand.<br /><br />So I say it is a 5 star as far as qualaity and truth. But how it leaves you feeling is a 1 so I settled on 3.<br /><br />If you cannot handle total violence then choose one of the many other great Holocaust movies to learn more. This will leave you very upset and traumatized.
B0015519VS|1.0|This is just another bland, boring, dull, pointless r&b album. What's the point in this music? Just to dance to something? What mindless garbage. Usher introduces nothing new to the musical world, Listen to rock and metal folks where at least there's a suprise when you listen to different bands that don't all sounda like. Chris Brown, Usher, Beyonce what's the real difference? None
B000WT7R6O|5.0|I was not able to watch this show when it first came on. My Directv at the time did not carry the WB. Anyway, I have a friend that loves this show, so I borrowed seasons 1 and 2 from him. I LOVE this show. I'm watching season 2 right now and its excellent. I love the characters and plots, it never gets old. So currently I'm recording the season 3 episodes on my DVR and will watch them in order until I can buy it on DVD. I would buy seasons 1 and 2 now on DVD from Amazon because they are cheaper here than anywhere else, but I have to wait until I get paid again. That just shows me how much I love this show. Why would I buy it when I've already watched it...because I would watch it again.
B0014CQNTK|4.0|Bittersweet and witty.  Great screenplay.  As for the double disc --careful: the second disc is only Digital players and CDROM.  Contrary to most Spec.Ed 2Disc sets:  All the Special Bonus Features are on DISC 1.  Should've just gotten the single disc version.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Well what can I say except Al is  back. This album is truly a classic and should be in everyone's cd collection especially al green's fans. It has that nice old school style from when al green was doing his thing back in the 70's, with a pinch of new school engineering. The only other thing I can say is buy this album. Definitely r&b/soul album of the year!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I recently purchased this DVD & have watched/listened to it a few times now. At first I didn't think much of his new mat'l. but have grown to really enjoy it.

The service I recieved from Amazon was typically professional & I will continue to use them as my primary mail order music house.
0345495004|3.0|For Frank Lloyd Wright fans, familiar with his somewhat scandalous personal history will enjoy this story - but it does somewhat dredge on, and frankly (no pun intended) I am not at all sure why Frank so addored Mamah - she is not the most \\"loving\\" character, actually quite selfish, although she did put up with alot of Frank's shenanigans - however, in the end, they lead to her and her children's tragic end, as selfishness often does.  A cautionary tale, interesting for history buffs - but not great reading or writing.
0930289234|4.0|I've been collected comics for the last 20 years, and I never had the time to read this series until someone bought this for me as a gift. I heard all the rumors of how amazing this book was for its time, but after reading it and making up my own mind I can honestly say that the book is a tad overrated. Now don't take this the wrong way, its a great book with a very deep message, but if you've been an active comic reader for the last 10 years you would agree that this book is a little on the tame side compared to todays products.<br /><br />Overall its a good book, but I wouldn't put it in my top 10 list of all time favorite comics.

1573229725|5.0|If you're looking to escape from your normal life of boredom, loneliness, and desire for a more interesting life, Sarah Waters' novel, Fingersmith, is a satisfactory yet above average novel to read. Sue and Maud are two lonely girls from different ends of the Victorian spectrum. Sue is poor, orphaned, and abandoned while Maud is an heiress. Both are trapped by their life's circumstances, Maud must marry and Sue must become a criminal in order to survive. In the end, the two young girls develop a mutual attraction to each other. Waters' novel is quite a treat for those of us who seek Victorian romanticism while at the same time it's not for realists like myself. I prefer the realistic novels while this novel is not only realistic but yet it is sensual and the two young girls find themselves in a very difficult situation. Lesbianism was still forbidden in Victorian times even though it has been around forever. Sue and Maud must come to terms with their relationship. At first, the relationship just seems ideal much like a lesbian soap opera but not all relationships end as well or forever. We don't really know what happens to Sue and Maud after the novel is finished but we do want to know more. I would have loved to have seen them ten years after possibly together or apart. Did they last? Did they go their separate ways? Did they find love elsewhere? Maybe good books like Fingersmith makes us ask those questions about Sue and Maud about ourselves. The book is a great escapism from our own troubling realities. We live in a society that nobody is complete without a partner whether heterosexual or homosexual. Those of us who are alone are often under suspicion by our peers, relatives, friends, colleagues, etc. Sue and Maud's genuine love and affection for each other comes through in Waters' writing. But we all want the love and happines from finding a soul mate, we must ask ourselves if Sue and Maud are soulmates or kindred spirits. We can only use our imagination to determine the outcome. Maybe all is not well, maybe they went their separate ways. We all yearn to find love and happiness with someone but we must first find happiness with ourselves.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I was nervous about this album because I was so in love with \\"Mama's Gun\\" when \\"New Amerykah\\" came out (see my previous review).  But no matter, I pre-ordered this one because Erykah is now one of my \\"must buy\\" artists.  By no means was I disappointed by this one, but (as one reviewer put it), I was a little bewildered.  I wasn't sure what to make of it.  But after playing it regularly these past three months (perhaps too much so) I have to say this ranks up with everything she has done so far.  But in addition to that, it really does start from a point after her previous albums.  That in fact seems to be her legacy.  Each album seems to be a different experience from the others.  Not exactly taking a radical left turn, but not repeating anything either (except her deliberate attempts to reuse previous words and phrases, such as \\"... & On\\" in \\"Mama's Gun\\").  I think there are many layers to \\"New Amerykah\\" that are off-putting to beat-driven ears.  There are moments on here to satisfy those base urges (try playing the first track with your car windows down--and hear how The Man's voice can grab everyone's ears), but it otherwise forces you to ride the train to hear everything being said.  I think it has been a great experience and it only adds to her short yet amazing canon.  I CAN'T WAIT for Part II!!  She's my new goddess.

B000001GK9|5.0|I tend to be wary of \\"legendary recordings\\", because all too often I've indeed found their qualities to be more legend than reality. Nor do I particularly seek out live recordings; I don't like extraneous noise, and don't give two cents for the theory that music recorded live in front of an audience has some mysterious kind of additional \\"frisson\\". Reason enough to approach this, Karajan's second recording of Mahler's Ninth, with some reserve. Only to find that it blows me off my feet and goes straight to the top of the list. If you want only one single recording of this endlessly fascinating, deeply moving work, this one would be extremely recommendable.<br /><br />Its qualities are so manifold that I hardly know where to begin. Things that are instantly striking are the beauty of the playing all round; the exemplary blending and balancing of instruments; the thorough faithfulness to the score; the utter precision and clarity of articulation; the precise execution of the full dynamic range, with true ppp's. On closer acquaintance, these felicities are subsumed by something even greater: Karajan's supreme grip of the architecture, his purposeful handling of ebb and flow, an overarching sense of something awesomely majestic, yet deeply intimate at the same time. He truly lays bare the soul of this symphony, and has an unerring sense for the mystery inherent in many passages.<br /><br />The result is always controlled - too often, as with Bernstein or Abbado conducting this same orchestra, the first movement errs on the side of rough-and-tumble wildness; but Karajan projects its dense polyphony clearly and purposely even in the busiest bars. Which does in no way reduce, but rather increases the power of such moments as the devastating fff statement of the opening motif at the climax. The middle movements are richly characterised and the Rondo is executed with heartstopping virtuosity. The crowning glory is then the final Adagio, which has a searing intensity second to none, its warm emotionality offset by the second theme's cooler musings, the Lied von der Erde atmosphere tellingly invoked.<br /><br />Very compelling stuff indeed. Better still, the only thing betraying that this is a live recording are one or two minor lapses by horns and strings towards the end; you won't hear a trace of any audience. The sound is very pleasing, natural, and well-focussed, if maybe a tad light in the bass. In all, no matter how many recordings of this work you have, you should not  pass this one by.emotionality offset by the second theme's cooler musings, the Lied von der Erde atmosphere tellingly invoked.

0385340567|3.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is one of the few I purchase in hard cover as soon as they come out.  I buy them, I read them, I keep them, and then I read them over again, sometimes several times over the space of a couple of years.  This one, though, I wish I'd waited for the paperback.  I may keep it, but I doubt I will reread it.  For the first time I actually found times when I didn't like Jack Reacher, when he acted out of character in a way that lost my favor.  I won't say how or why, since you may also be a Reacher fan, and I want you to read this.  Just wait for the paperback.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is a film that actually works even though the premise is outrageous. This is probably Cruise's best performance ever! Who knew he could play such a seedy character. Foxx was nominated for best supporting actor, he is pretty good in this even though he is not my cup of tea. The only thing wrong with this film is the casting of Jada Pinkett Smith, jeez that woman cannot act worth a dime! This film isn't perfect but it's pretty close thanks to director Michael Mann.
B00007L4OM|3.0|This story of French cop, Hubert (Jean Reno), who travels to Japan following the death of his former lover and discovers a 19 year-old daughter he never knew he had is not Luc Besson's finest movie (Besson wrote the script of this movie, but did not direct it), but it is entertaining enough and Reno is always worth watching. The tone of the script is very much along the lines of Besson's action-comedy, \\"Taxi\\", with elements of \\"Leon - the Professional\\" thrown in. This film does not take itself too seriously and there are some fun action set-pieces along the way (the fight scene at the golf range is particularly notable), although the film could have been improved by an increase in the number of these action scenes. Overall, I see this film as Besson-light (much like \\"Bandidas\\"). The comedy isn't as fine-tuned as Besson's best comedies and the action isn't up to the same standard as his best action films, but it is still better than a lot of the action-comedies that are around and worth the price of purchase.
B000E41MRC|5.0|This is the infamous documentary produced by Leni Riefenstahl of the 1934 Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg, Germany. Working with an unlimited budget, she created the almost perfect propaganda film to promote the Nazi Party in Germany. Fascinating today, just for the historical interest, it has been the model over the decades for others wanting to understand the power of propaganda film. It was a powerful influence in establishing Hitler as the messiah for Germany. It was shown in part or whole in every theater throughout Germany during WWII. Of course, today we see it thru the lens of history and the unspeakable evil that was committed by Hitler and his regime but the people watching in 1934 did not have that insight. At the very least, it is a powerful warning to those of us who have the benefit of history to be more discerning in our falling for those who would seek to use this same kind of propaganda to push a cause, no matter how noble or good it might seem and the Nazi Party certainly seemed to be a noble cause for the German people. Riefenstahl used 30 cameras and 120 technicians during the filming. Hitler was always filmed separately so he could be edited in and out of the crowd pictures for maximum manipulation of imagery and seduction of the mind. While it runs a little long and is a little repetitive in places, this is an amazing piece of history and very much worthwhile of your time. WWW.LUSREVIEWS.BLOGSPOT.COM
B000WGWQG8|5.0|GREAT! Now I need to read the book. From some of the reviews I hear the book is a lot better so I look forward to it. I can understand people's poor reviews because it wasn't as good as the book. Gods and Generals was a very poor movie compared to Jeff Shaara's book. As for John Adams I'm glad I saw the series first because I think this is how every book should be done! It was a homerun for HBO and I really hope they do spin offs for the other founding fathers.
B000055Y0X|5.0|There's no denying Peter Sellers' genius as he exhibits this very well in three main character parts that he plays here: the President, Mandrake, and Dr. Strangelove himself.  These are three very different and unique roles and the fact that he pulls all three off very well speaks volumes of his comedic genius.  It's a travesty that he didn't win the Oscar for this and only his performance in [[ASIN:B001IHJ974 Being There [Blu-ray]]] comes anywhere close to the very high standards he sets here.  I've seen [[ASIN:B004TJ1H1E Some Like It Hot [Blu-ray]]] placed higher than this film on lists of best comedies of all time but I disagree because as much as [[ASIN:B000ZM1MG4 Tootsie - 25th Anniversary Edition]] and that film must have been hilarious at the time of release, many of the jokes do not age well up to this day with the exception of this film which is still very funny today.  George C. Scott is also very good in this comedic role and this role is possibly one of the reasons someone thought of giving the role of Patton to him for what would later become his best ever screen performance in the movie \\"Patton\\".<br /><br />The dvd could have been better restored picture quality-wise and more sound options such as Dolby 5.1 surround would have been appreciated rather than just the Mono here but otherwise, this version with a good documentary among the bonus features is still value for money.<br /><br />A good comedy that ages well although it would be interesting to see what they do to improve upon this version for the Blu-ray one.  Hopefully, better picture and sound quality options and more bonus features are among them.<br /><br />Updated 21 May 2011:<br /><br />Amazon won't allow me to review this separately and so I'll do it here: [[ASIN:B001DJLCPE Dr. Strangelove  [Blu-ray]]] is a real treat for fans and is definitely worth the upgrade.  The picture and sound quality have improved by leaps and bounds and although the film is heavily dialogue driven the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround option is a nice addition as well as the improved special feature documentaries.  The picture book is also a joy to behold having been very well assembled making this blu-ray release currently the definitive version of the film that is out there.  This together with [[ASIN:B000Y5JFN4 This Is Spinal Tap [Blu-ray]]] is my favourite comedy of all time and unlike most comedies whose gags get old and hence do not reward repeated viewing this film is one I look forward to watching at least annually.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!ce addition as well as the improved special feature documentaries.

630522577X|4.0|This musical won 8 Oscars including Best Picture and it is richly deserving of the accolades.  The cast is superb and the songs are all standards destined to be appreciated over the years.  I've watched this film many times over the years and I never get tired of watching it and in fact I'm looking forward to the next screening.  No fan of musicals should be without this dvd in their collection.<br /><br />The dvd itself is also a treat as it has been restored pretty well.  Picture quality-wise it isn't perfect but it's still very good given the state of the severely deteriorated original master and is still a lot better than many other \\"restored\\" older films that I've seen.  Also widescreen format is the best way to view this film and this is the format in which it is presented here on this dvd.  There is a nice short making-of documentary included and the biggest plus of this dvd version is the excellent sound quality that comes in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  I've seen other films with this feature but they don't sound as good but it is clear here that a lot of effort went into vastly improving and getting the most out of the 5.1 format.<br /><br />Excellent sound quality and very good picture quality make this dvd great value for money.  I wonder what other improvements we can expect from the upcoming Blu-ray version?  As far as standard dvd versions go though, this version is very, very good.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000XCZGVI|5.0|I just wanted to add my two cents' worth regarding the HD DVD version of this film.  In a way, I am sorry that this was one of the first Hi-Def discs that I purchased: sorry because it has the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous video quality I have yet seen.  It makes even excellent transfers of other films look second-rate.   This is the first film to be shot using almost exclusively the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream Camera and this disc was mastered using the original elements.  It is like looking at life through a window.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Walt Disney's \\"Lady And The Tramp\\" was never one of my personal favorite films as a child.  I'm all grown up now, and it has become a very enjoyable treat for me and my entire family.  For those unfamiliar with the story, here's a brief explanation:  Cocker Spaniel Lady has a perfect life until a baby shows up.  She begins to feel neglected and when her owners take a little vacation and leave her and the baby with Aunt Sarah, she winds up on the mean streets alone....until Tramp shows up.  He defends her, has a romantic dinner with her and eventually finds his way into her heart.  It's all executed with Disney's classic perfection and littered with wonderful songs like \\"Bella Notte\\" and \\"We Are Siamese.\\"<br /><br />What really makes this film worth five stars is the treatment it receives in this platinum edition.  The digital restoration looks and sounds great.  The extras are some of the best I've ever seen, especially the \\"Backstage Disney\\" features that give animation fans a wonderful look at the development of the film.<br /><br />If you're a fan of animation, this DVD is a must.  The special features alone are worth the purchase price.  Fans of light romance, family films and dogs will also love this classic Disney tale.  Highly recommended.
0385333846|4.0|Set during World War II, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a humorous antiwar book. Billy Pilgrim is a war veteran who becomes \\"unstuck  in time.\\" He seems to be obsessed with the aliens, called the Tralfamadorians, that supposedly abducted him and could see in the fourth dimension. Right off the bat, Slaughterhouse-Five has caught our attention. As we read through the novel, the way we experience it is the same as Billy sees time, disconnected and random. The book keeps jumping from time period to time period, thoroughly confusing the reader. In some places, Vonnegut makes himself a character in his own novel. It is confusing to the point that the reader has no idea if Billy or Vonnegut is talking.  The novel makes us slightly disillusioned in the fact that we don't know the difference between real and fake. We are convinced (as is his family) that Billy is crazy and what he tells us about the Tralfamadorians is obviously untrue. But how are we to know if everything else he tells us of the war is true? The satire and irony in this book add comic relief to what would usually be a depressing scene, to our enjoyment.  The genius of Slaughterhouse-Five is that Vonnegut seems so apathetic about war in places that we wonder why this is even considered an antiwar book. But the reality is that his use of understatement and reverse psychology arouses feelings in us. When he says war cannot be stopped, we think (more passionately than if he was agreeing with us) that yes, it can. When he says there is no such thing as free will, we say yes, there is. All in all, Slaughterhouse-Five is an enjoyable way to use one's time.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|Okay i know some devoted DM fans say this isn't the greatest recompilation Cd, i know, they have so many albums and so many good songs that it's impossible to include them all, but i guess there will be a volume II? hopefully...<br />I like this cd a lot, i think they picked the right songs, I'm a relatively new fan(like a year ago) and before this cd i bought their last work \\"Playing The Angel\\",DM are one of the few bands thay i can say have not a really bad song, they are awesome.

068987474X|4.0|A fun, antidotal, book chalked full of all the masculine cliches that we smart women wish were not true.  But, as my momma said (long before this book existed) there would be boys like this.  Cute and entertaining, light and charming a fun book to give to a girlfriend as a gag gift.  However, if you have even a trace of common sense, most of these chapters will be leaving you with a rather deja vu perspective.             Although, if you are picking up this book because you think you cannot find Mr. Right on your own, STOP, and do not pick up this book or any other book.  As a matter of fact, burn all those relationship books on your night-stand (preferably some place safe), invest in a sexy outfit, go out on the town and use your \\"COMMON SENSE...\\"   And, for god-sake, be your self!!!! That is the sexiest quality any of us woman have...
0783225857|5.0|Without much knowledge of history behind the acclaimed author Truman Capote, I watched the film \\"Capote\\" sometime back, and was interested in knowing more about his childhood friend Harper Lee and the her Pulitzer prize willing novel \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" mentioned in the film. After reading the reviews, I realized that this novel is tagged as the book of the century in American literature by the critics and the fans. I bought the film with high expectations, and all my expectations were exceeded by this masterpiece. This movie and the history behind Harper Lees work touched me so deep, that I went to imdb ([...]) and gave it a perfect 10 rating. This is the only movie I have rated 10 so far, although I have given 9 to about dozen of movies. ([...])<br /><br />Being an alien to American way of life and its discourse, I think I have uncovered one of the gems in modern American literature. Reasons, that I was drawn so much to this movie could be personal to me as well. The little girl who plays the lead role reminds me of my own little daughter, and the Atticus Finch's character in this movie, could be the role model of fatherhood for any given culture.
0312379293|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read this year.  I love Mr. Arhcer's characters and his ability to surprise.  This would be a great book to take on vacation.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|This movie had me feeling lost and disappointed almost from the beginning.  The protagonist is inherently unlikable.  Unnecessary characters and plot lines flooded the screen.  The story basically goes nowhere.  Pick any scene from the scene select, and I couldn't tell you what's going on in it.      Here's an example of a line of dialogue that came out of NOWHERE and made no sense:  \\"One night I'm going to come to you in your house, wherever you are, and cut your throat.\\"    I haven't even gotten to the end of this movie and already it's about the worst I've ever seen.
0780622553|5.0|Dark City will always stand out as being one of the most unfairly ignored films from the 1990s.  It had all the makings of a great science fiction film: top notch acting, an original plot, spectacular visual effects, clever dialogue, and tension so thick it deflects bullets.  Yet it also had some things about it that doomed it to box office failure.  It had no major box office draws in its cast, it was poorly marketed, and the story went over way too many people's heads.  But all that is inconsequential to the quality of the film.  This was a movie that should have reaped the same profits that went to big budgeted, empty CGI fests like [[ASIN:B00004RFFI Twister]], [[ASIN:B00008G8M4 Independence Day]], and [[ASIN:B00000G3PA Armageddon]].<br /><br />Many see DC as being sort of a spiritual prelude to the Matrix series, and not just because it came out one year earlier the first [[ASIN:B00000K19E Matrix]] film.  Both deal with people in a seemingly ordinary world that is made to appear so by shadowy forces to conceal a horrifying truth.  Both also have a hero who is conditioned by these puppet masters to see himself as ordinary, but as the story progresses, he learns that he has a messianic destiny.  And both ask the question, \\"What is real?\\"<br /><br />Here a group of bald humanoid aliens with chalk white skin control all aspects of life in a city that seems to be built according to pre-WWII aesthetics.  The aliens are the last survivors of an immensely ancient and dying race.  The only way they believe they are able to save themselves from extinction is to learn to be \\"human\\".  Every midnight, they change everything (and I mean everything from the city's architecture to the inhabitant's memories) by \\"tuning\\".  When the aliens replace the memories of ordinary man John Murdoch with those of a serial killer, the best laid plans of chalk white aliens and men go astray.  Being a wanted man, Murdoch is able to \\"tune\\" a little himself when his life depends on it.  Could there be more to him than that?<br /><br />As I said earlier, this is one of the most underrated movies from the 1990s, and one of the greatest American science fiction movies ever made.  Like just about all SF films from the 1990s, it had its fair share of CGI.  Only here, it is part of the storytelling instead of a distraction from it.<br /><br />The cast is also brilliant.  Rufus Sewell does a fine job capturing the essence of Murdoch, an average man who finds himself in circumstances that are anything but.  Playing his unfaithful (or was she?) wife is Jennifer Connelly, one actress who is just as talented as she is good looking.  William Hurt gives us another fine performance as the cop that is pursuing Murdoch, but he also believes that there is more going on than what sees.  Unfortunately, later in 1998 Hurt would star in the postitively dismal [[ASIN:0780622650 Lost in Space]]. And finally, Kiefer Sutherland looks like he had the time of his life hamming it up as the German mad scientist stereotype turncoat Dr. Schreber.  His character is not very realistic, but is enjoyable to watch.  None of these people for the time had the box office clout of someone like Jim Carrey or Arnold Schwarzeneggar, but that didn't stop them from making a magnificent movie.<br /><br />As great as the things I mentioned above are, what really stood out to me was some of the questions this movie asked?  Were the aliens really evil since they did what they did so they could survive, and not because of those time honored explanations like conquest or just plain exterminating humans?  Might these aliens be what the human race could become in the distant future?  Are we only the product of our accumulated memories or are we more than that?  And are memories a true reflection of our souls?<br /><br />But don't spend too much time thinking about that right now.  Just watch and enjoy.him than that?

0671004107|5.0|This was a great story. I am a science and astronomy buff so this was right up my ally. Sagan did a wonderful job and I love how he put an agnostic scientist in the place of not being able to prove the experience she had with aliens. I read this book years ago and when the movie came out I couldn't wait to see it. Sagan was a wonderful human being and tread lightly when it came to the beliefs of others.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've been an avid listener of Coldplay for almost a decade now, and was very excited about the release of this album. It was, however, not what I expected, but quickly became my favorite. The album mixes rock and melody between and within songs, without losing the momentum that they are known for. If you are a fan, this album is a must, and if you haven't gotten into them yet, this album is a great place to start.
0790733226|5.0|I have always been a science buff and a science fiction fan. This movie was wonderful. I think it is not far off to what our reaction would be if we were contacted by others in the galaxy. Jodie Foster was wonderful as Ellie Arraway and the spirit of the book was carried over into the film. The film does take some liberties with characters and what occured in the book but that was only to make it fit into a 2 hour movie.
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|I'm new to Elbow as of this CD (although I see on their Wikipedia page that John Cale chose their \\"Switching Off\\" as one of his desert island discs, which makes me feel like I should have known about them), so I can't compare with any previous work they've done. But I felt as if I was listening to Peter Gabriel singing material that was the lovechild of Coldplay and Beck. Not to say that any of that is bad; I quite enjoyed it as the kind of eccentric but largely ambient music that makes, say, preparing dinner while sipping a glass of wine an even more pleasant task.<br /><br />That said, none of the tracks stand apart for me, even after a few casual listens. It's one of those albums that mixes well into a quiet dinner party soundtrack but probably won't mix well into a playlist that's meant to be truly paid attention to.
0143038583|5.0|The author has done an excellent job educating his readers about food, all the way from the shelf back to its roots.  I never knew corn was such a driving force in the market.  I liked his casual style of writing, and even though it's non-fic, he did a great job bringing the reader into the scene.  It was easy to imagine some of the places he went to see for himself the processing of many foods.  Excellent read, and well-worth the money.

0143038419|5.0|I could relate to this memoir - everyone is dysfunctional in their own way, but Gilbert isn't afraid to put herself out there.  I admired her writing style, her wit and ability to laugh at herself.  She is poignant about issues that many people face everyday. Interesting perspectives on three different cultures which richly contrast with American life.

It's obvious that the previous reviewer has never purchased a luxury edition of a book. The old-world style of the unique pages was created to give this work that classic feel.  Shame on you! You need to look at other luxury editions before commenting on something you know nothing about.  Everyone out there...enjoy this beautifully crafted work of art.
B0017KP93U|5.0|Gorgeous melodies, cerebral yet heartfelt music.  It's all here.  How pleased was I to see that Radiohead's two most cinematic, epic songs are back-to-back on this glorious 'disc':  Let Down and Planet Telex.  These songs speak to the humanity of all of us, raising disappointing and somber moments to sublime beauty.  So many good songs besides.   From the George Orwell 1984 quote 2 + 2 = 5, not a betrayal of any lack of math prowess, to the beloved No Surprises, these songs speak to everyone humanly, poignantly, and with great aplomb.  Divine.  Enjoy.

075640407X|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss has created a world that works. The story is fairly straightforward, hero in quiet retirement, cannot quite escape mythic past, describes all to passing scribe. So most of the book is a flashback, which means that at least he isn't going to die during the story. The pacing is very good, it rips along and the occasional trips back to the Inn where the storytelling is taking place provide an equally entertaining story thread. One that works very well within the whole tale. and what a tale it is, an epic saga of a boy who overcomes tragedy to follow his talent. He is fairly accomplished, magician, pickpocket, musician, brave, right minded soul. Despite what could be a recipe for an overblown two dimensional character, he comes across as balanced and believable. Not too much whiny self absorption, he simply is what he is, pretty good at everything, and makes the most of it. The writing is very plain, plain in journalistic sense, it never drags or gets too crystalline or precious. More, it unfolds like a documentary with no talking head.  He even manages to have a school of magical arts that does not imitate, or even allude to the big H. Quite an achievement. He is a bit naive and there are a couple of very lucky meetings and the like, but basically it is a ripping yarn that is refreshing, in a genre that can be tired and repetitive. The big complaint is the wait for volume two. Highly recommended.
B00139W3NE|3.0|The positive is that it truly is perfectly casted, Daniel Craig as Lord Asriel, Ian McKellen as the voice of Iroek, Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter, Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala, and my favorite: Sam Elliot as Lee Scoresby; and the ongoing cast of A-list actors perfectly fit for their roles in Golden Compass. Every actor in this movie seemed to have given it their all, and in my opinion couldn't have been better casted for their roles.    The soundtrack, although not as epic and sweeping as Lord of the Rings, seemed to carry an optimistic, mystic, and fantastical if not a bit underwhelming tune throughout the movie. Especially during the large battle scene at the end of the movie.    Also, although not the best I've seen, the CGI is remarkable. Almost seamless; the deamons are extremely believable and very, very charming. The first scene, by which the camera pans through a curtain of dust into another universe, was very well done and complimented the feel and premise of the story. The frantic scenes of people being killed and their daemons bursting into golden dust- albeit different from the book's \\"fading away\\" approach- added greatly to the excitement and really gave a unique feel to the battle scenes, even if it does look a little too much like the 'Blade' series. The world is displayed spectacularly as Lyra and Roger walk along Oxford's rooftops, giving the truely beautiful and awe-inspiring feel that the books gave.      **SPOILERS**    Another thing I liked, that I never really felt in the book, was Mrs. Coulter's seemingly genuine compassion for Lyra. In the novel, it came across that Coulter truly could care less about Lyra's well-being and simply pretended to care for the sake of the Magisterium's wellfare. In the book, I felt as though Coulter simply was the Magisterium, as it is said many times. However, in the movie she is presented as a puppet used by the Magisterium against her own better understanding, something I feel is much more spot-on about organized religion than her merely being a fanatic control freak. I could've missed this in the book, it might've been so subtle I couldn't recognize it; either way I feel it was a good addition to the movie.    However, the negative is overwhelming, and although it doesn't completely destroy the movie, it takes it down from the pedastal of epics that the story really deserves to be on. The completely uninspired direction from Weitz; it seems as though he had a huge project and absolutely no idea where to go with it. Also the relentlessly butchered storyline to fit the time frame. Although it's understandable that not everything could be included in the story, they certainly could've been less \\"liberal\\" with it. I believe it was \\"dumbed down\\" to be made more understandable, as many of the main plot points seemed to have been easier to explain than in the book.     They all but completely severe the anti-religious aspects of the story, simply sticking to saying \\"Bad people\\" and \\"Organization\\" rather than \\"Catholic\\" and \\"Chuch\\" one too many times, relieving its onslaught on organized religion to a near halt. When viewing the movie, it seems to get along fine without it, though it truely distracts from what the novel tried to say about organized religion's control over 'truth'. The Magisterium's \\"The Fall of Man\\" view on Dust is rather made into \\"Bad people rebelled\\" and the entire section quoting the bible- while giving it a parallel universe twist with daemons- is excluded completely. Whether this was a genuine attempt to make the movie more likeable, and therefore more popular and a bigger box office; or it was just a twist in the wind avoiding relentless hate-mail from fanatics drawing ill-attention to New Line; or if they're saving the \\"heavy\\" things for the sequels is beyond me, but still disappointing either way, and the depth of the story takes many hits from it.    Some awkward and nonsensical moments also can be seen in various scenes. For one: when Lyra first metsIroek, she uses the compass and says \\"I know where the armor is\\" followed by Iroek blurting out a full-on contract with Lyra without any form of \\"If you take me to it\\" as was very prominent in the book, and topped off with Iroek storming down town- with Lyra following- and somehow finding his armor. I really don't know what the gimmick here was, if Iroek already knew where his armor was but didn't get it because he had no reason to; if somehow Lyra guided him to his armor in an off-screen way; or any other reason. Either way it seemed very choppy, rushed and confusing, incoherent opposed to the novel's silky-smooth fluidity.    The section of the novel where Lyra interacts and grows fond of Gyptians, even starting to believe that she is one as well, building a loyal, loveable and even political enviroment, is completely removed. Time and budgets are a main factor, obviously, but to me this section gave so much heart and feeling to the novel, so much purpose in community and loyalty. The debate whether or not to raid the North to rescue the children, the rule that no women were to join the excursion (Ma Costa, in the movie, is in the final battle), and so fourth is completely removed.    The story of Billy becoming ghastly after his daemon is removed is reduced greatly- making almost 2 chapters of discussion and suspense into a 5 minute scene, albeit an emotional and powerful one at that. Nearly every single majestic view of the Aurora is removed, in fact the \\"Northern Lights\\" aren't seen between Lord Asriel's presentation at Oxford and the final scene of the movie.    The entire section in which Roger and Lyra explore Oxford, including the catacombs and tombs undergound is also removed. Really the list of removed material is almost uncountable: Lyra's history with Asriel, the Oxford Master's history with Asriel and the Magisterium, the story of why Asriel and Coulter seperated (leading to the story of Lyra's nanny), the depth of the \\"gang wars\\" between Jordan, Oxford and Gyptians; Lyra's experience in the Experimental building, Lyra's experience in the prison of Bears, Iroek and Iofur's history, the Female Bear, the list really is endless.    The last thing I'll mention and gripe about: that ending. Completely removing the entire section when Asriel and Coulter are reunited, when Asriel cuts off roger's daemon and establishes the bridge between worlds, the whole chapter of Asriel explaining charged particals and its relation to Creationism and Parallel Univeres, the discussion between Serafina Pekkala and Lyra on Scoresby's flying machine, and so much more plot twists and emotional changes. You really can tell they rushed it, and either the abruptedly blatant ending is a ploy to get a bigger audience for The Subtle Knife (should it indeed be made) or simply a rush to get it into theaters.      The redeeming factor in this movie is what they got right, they really got right. Especially the Daemons and characters to name a few; in fact the characters would've been almost perfect had it not been for the complete absence of character development and a lack of true backround for any of them.    Overall a decent if not very disappointing movie. Certainly enjoyable, but not especially for \\"hardcore\\" fans of the novel.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|this album has a quality that evokes a listening response. the beat, though varied throughout the numerous songs, factors in as a reliable timing mechanism. the rhythm has a contributory effect that combine the melodies with the beat (much like a hamburger patty links two pieces of bread). the tonal variations segue between the songs and provide a numerical order that accurately matches the song list. overall this release is a musical effort that requires an electronic sound device.
1881273156|5.0|I was never much on self-help books. This one was recommended to me by a close friend during a time when my marriage was in trouble. It was a great benefit to both my wife and myself. It should be required reading for anyone in a serious relationship, especially those contemplating marriage or married.
B000BSNPRG|3.0|The Silent Force was one of my favourite albums at the time, and, needless to say, I was very excited about seeing how they would execute their rich sound on stage. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that the method is to get the drummer and singer to perform to a backing tape of bass, guitars, and orchestra. I obviously can't speak for the other reviewers of this DVD nor anyone else, but personally when I see live music I want to see LIVE music. That may seem obvious, but so many bands these days think it's acceptable to just sing to a backing tape and call it a concert.     That being said, it is wonderful to at least see Sharon and Stephen in action. Sharon has a great onstage persona and it's very easy to fall in love with her in this concert! She sings and performs wonderfully. The concert is also set on the most amazing stage I have ever seen, with ships and cruisers passing by to the side. Hardcore fans will not be dissapointed by the sheer volume of features which include a LOT of behind-the-scenes footage, some videoclips, and also some snippets from other live concerts.     Hardcore fans will obviously not go past this release but those only interested in seeing a genuine live concert should look probably look elsewhere.
B000OT6V00|5.0|This movie is great. It looks and sounds awesome on blu-ray.<br />Dont have dvd to be able to compare.
B000NA2776|4.0|Mika's debut album, \\"Life in Cartoon Motion\\" is one of the more eclectic releases I've heard recently. Mika jumps from genre to genre on every track. From the sing-song school girl chorus of \\"Lollipop\\" to the Jason Mraz-esque \\"My Interpretation\\" you just can't help but love Mika's catchy pop sound. \\"Relax, Take It Easy\\" sounds like it belongs somewhere in \\"Night at the Roxbury\\" while \\"Billy Brown\\" sounds like it could almost fit somewhere in the Avenue Q soundtrack. \\"Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\\" evokes a dance club from yesteryear, while \\"Over My Shoulder\\" sounds like music for a Cirque du Soleil act. Mika even takes on the pop music tradition of recycling the chords from Pachabel's canon in \\"Happy Ending\\" (listen close if you don't believe me). Between the powerhouse of sound from producer Greg Wells (who has worked with Jamie Cullum, Jars of Clay, the Deftones, Rufus Wainright, Lindsay Lohan and Hanson), the album's eclecticism and inventive arrangements that feature horns, beats, keyboards, guitars and others, this album is pop gold. And even with the album being so eclectic, Mika's signature energy and piercing falsetto vocals put his signet seal on each cut. The only drawback, is that because the album is so varied in genre, while almost everyone can probably find a song they enjoy, almost everyone can probably find one or more songs they could do without. Personally, I could do without \\"Happy Ending\\" and \\"My Interpretation,\\" and other listeners can probably find their own songs that they could do without. In a nutshell, Mika's got a very strong debut that you really can't make the final judge on just by the single that is floating around. Give the whole album a chance, and pull down the ones that you really like and throw away the rest.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|This is a classic. And they redited it so it looks amazing. The case is cool too if you want to display it. It fold up to open. I really love this movie. You should check out the new figures they just put out for it.
B000QFCD5O|4.0|This is a good live album, coming from someone who doesn't really like live albums.  They sound great and can tell they are enjoying the ride.  Hope they stick around a while
B000GTJT16|3.0|The transfer to HD DVD on this is just ok. My advice would be to buy the regular dvd. I know that its the way it was shot its suppose to look grainy. But when it comes to HD its just not worth it for Grainy movies unless you just buy it for the sound.  Best bet, Go find the dvd for 4.99
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Finally a quality DVD recording of this tour.  Awesome awesome stuff.  They did it right.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this for my Nikon D80 and it goes along really nice. Not as big as the bulky SB-600 or 800. Its a great carry around flash for leisure shooting. If your wrking a wedding or something I would go for the upper models but if your just starting out and dont need the big guns then this is for you.
B000YAA68W|4.0|This movie relates very accurately the events from the writer's prespective without getting too invloved in the politics. It's done tastefully and obejectively.
B00068NVI4|1.0|After reading some of these reviews about the bad audio on this dvd, please note that the tracks recorded live from the show are then re-mixed and mastered in a studio. Therefore, the studio producer and or the band itself is really to blame. After listening to a clip on the band's website, I tend to agree with your complaints.
B00005JOA0|5.0|Anne Bronte is an early proponent of women's rights.  Although least known of the Bronte sisters Anne seems to be the most intelligent of the three.  This is a wonderful story of a young woman who finds herself locked into a marriage with a very rich abusive husband, her struggles to escape his control & begin again in life as an independent woman.  I would highly recommend 'The Tennant Of Wildfell Hall' to any Bronte/period piece enthusiast
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|After hearing the advance notice of a new Portishead album I decided to revisit their second album which I had sort of dismissed at the time, initially put off by the it's different approach (from Dummy's vastly compelling hip-hop based sound).  After listening to it now I find that I really like it.  Even though they did take a different approach, it is still unmistakenly Portishead, yet with even more range.  In hindsight, I can now appreciate their taking the chance of limiting their original hip-hop context for alternate instrumentation - it helped expand their sound and showed that they were more than just a one-trick pony.    Third is no different, and just as expansive and progressive.  It takes several listens for it to sink in, but once it does you realize it is the same creatively throbbing pulsing rhythms and haunting vocals that you would expect from Portishead.  Beth Gibbons vocal phrasing is as creative as ever and the music arrangements that complement her vocals so beautifully are just as compelling.  Portishead's Third certainly stands as another solid document from a thoughtfully creative band that would probably not waste their time releasing sub-par work.     So, ignore all those that claim this album does not stand up to Portishead's high standard of quality and consistency - it most certainly does and shows that Portishead is a substantial work in progress that still has much to offer.
B000WDSZ8E|5.0|Downloaded this show to put on a Pocket PC and watch on a plane. It was very fun to watch and the 20 minute episodes are perfect diversions. The Unbox feature was easy to use and get the epiosdes onto the PDA (although I would like to be able to watch them on a PSP), but the download times are extremely slow compared to other things I have downloaded in the past.
B0015519VS|4.0|Progress - the thing we all aspire to realise but somehow forget to acknowledge.  This is what Usher acknowledges in this release.  He has grown, become a father, a husband but still has a passion to please his fans with great music and Usher sure does try.    I think this album is very good.  I am confident that every song could be a single and do very well on the charts but there is a problem.    The good, each song is sung with Passion and Great Delivery, Usher bears his soul on the records - namely Here I Stand, Appetite, Best Thing, Before I met you and Moving Mountains; he is playful - namely Love in this club, Trading Places, This ain't sex, What's your name; he enjoys singing these ones - namely Something Special, Love you gently, His mistakes, what's a man to do, Will work for love and the Title Track Here I Stand (especially the bridge in this one, it's brilliant)    I know I covered most the album's tracks here but that is because each one is worth mention.  Usher says in his covers notes that he listened to every recording in solitude and decided on which tracks should make the album, that has resulted in the good and the bad for the album.  The good, every track is a single, should be a live performance to remember.  The bad, the album doesn't flow.  The tracks don't have a natural progression for a complete album.  Each song conveys a different feeling in the listener and then the next one disrupts that listening mood and pleasure.  I guarantee you, listen to every track singly before going to the next one and you'll see what I mean (They're good).    The direction needed was that he should have been constructed the album as a performance, to take the listener through the highs (only two uptempo tracks), lows, happy, sad, reflective, sensual and climatic moods that we all receive and enjoy from Music.  I only hope he doesn't re-release this one as most other artists do with poor sales, it doesn't deserve nor require to be.  Hopefully most people get this album (no synthesizers or voice box I might add), and I want Usher to work his butt off to perform and market this one as it should have been a classic but in today's market I think it's a stellar effort.      Support it y'all, you'll enjoy it for the progression he is showing us again as an artist, and bearing his soul as he did with Confessions.  Oh yea... BOY can really SIIING, check out the vocals!!    Peace y'all...til the next album review.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I was just begining to find out who Annie Lennox was around the time \\"Songs\\" was coming out, i had seen a snippet of the \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) music video on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 80's and i immediatley had to know everything about this artist. I did my research  just in time to see that she had just recentley released a Brand Spankin New Cd entitled \\"Songs Of Mass Destruction\\". Well with a name like that, WHO can resist? so i bought the cd and BOY WAS I GLAD!    SOMD is a collection of wonderfully crafted semi-dark ballads that are borderlining sheer perfection. Annie's voice is so pure and heartfelt. Your body feels every note she sings.    MY Top 5 are  1.Big Sky  2.Smithereens  3.Dark road  4.Lost  5.Love Is Blind    Songs of Mass Destruction is a must for every age. don't try to resist it.  You Know you WANT TO. SO BUYITNOW!

B001608QVS|5.0|Not much needs to be said about these films for the fans who follow them.    The transfer is amazing. These movies look better than they did in the theatre. I know...I worked in a theatre as an usher when Dirty Harry was released.    Audio is superb. Dolby True HD continues to amaze me for its muscular soundtracks.     Eastwood would be (and I'm sure is) very proud of this spectacular presentation. The included trinkets are good but the movies are the real deal.    If you are a fan of the Harry series and have an HD TV and a good Blu Ray player,  swallow and then fork over the 90 bucks to get the box set.     And once you have all of this set up, start up the Sudden Impact disc, crank up the volume in Dolby True HD and listen to Lalo Schifrin's amazing intro.     Get it.

B0015AARJI|2.0|I decided to go ahead and splurge on this controller thinking it was going to make a better gameplay in games such as COD 4. WRONG!! So far I think they have a lack of game choice for whats compatible with the controller. How are you not going to update the game of year to have this feature!?!? GTA has the rumble feature but hardly ever rumbles and most of the time I don't even notice because it's such a poor rumble. For being a 2 oz difference b/w the original controller and the dualshock is a BIG difference. I prefer the lighter controller...so in result I paid $50 for a controller that just sits there. Maybe I will continue using the heavier controller when they come out with the rumble feature on COD. LETS GO SONY!!
0066620996|5.0|I rarely if ever write reviews, but thought it important to reflect on the impact Good to Great has had on my business consciousness.  The real world examples are aspirational and show the impact leaders committed to being the best in their sector can have on the achievement of success.  Whilst my use of these concepts does not relate to the management of a multinational blue chip, they are very relevant to my approach to sales within the recruitment business I manage.  Recruitment focused on core areas of specialisation and the development of key communities of candidates is very much a driver of success and this is the power of the headhog concept at its most basic level.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|After losing the presidential election in November, 2000, algore had to find something with which to resurrect himself. Even though he is less than intelligent, he was able to gather that the latest crisis du jour - especially with the college crowd - is the so-called \\"Global Warming\\" scam. Perhaps you're old enough to remember when these same Chicken Littles were crying that the world's temperatures were falling, and they were calling it, \\"Global Cooling.\\" Robert Redford made a speech in which he whined that because of the earth's falling temperatures, all life on the planet would cease to exist long before the year 2000. Today, they claim the temps are climbing, and in the next generation, the Chicken Littles will probably come up with a scare tactic in which the world's temps are just too \\"erratic.\\"    The purpose of the Global Warming scam is to provide the federal government with more ways to tax and regulate the people. Even after the USA's unthinking, sheep-like people realize there's no such thing as global warming, the legislation will already be in place, we'll be paying significantly more in taxes because of the scam, and there will be no way to repeal the taxes once they're in place.    But, if you try to persuade people to do their own research and find out for themselves how much of a scam this thing is, you'll only incur their wrath. So, just sit back and laugh at the stupidity. Too many people have bought this con to stop it now.    Watching the buffoon in this flick try to \\"sell\\" the global warming scam as something serious is a hoot!
0784011710|4.0|[[ASIN:0784011710 Sophie's Choice]]  Having read the title Sophie's Choice, by William Styron, on which this movie is based upon and which is my favorite book of all the ones I have read until the present moment, because of its fantastic and extraordinary prose and drama plot, I just have to say that the movie does astonishingly depict the abovementioned literary work.     I am always very cautious about watching a movie based upon a literary work (particularly such a first-rate one) since it usually does not give merit to the primary source, however, this time, I was astoundingly well impressed.  Meryl Streep, as the fair, Arial featured polish woman Sophie Zawistowska, portrays excellently the drama of a woman that was and survived the Nazi's concentration camps, and for one reason or another, had the luck to come out alive and ends up living, in 1947, in New York inside her own understandable private hell. A nightmare she shares with Nathan, her lover- Kevin Kline- and their writer friend Stingo- Peter MacNicol-. Their lives are entirely full of lies and, as the drama goes on, these falsehoods begin to unravel until the ending, when Sophie conveys her most hideous choice.    Steep's actuation or performance is outstanding, brilliant and beautiful, and it won her an Academy Award.     I would utterly recommend seeing this movie after you have read the masterpiece on which is based upon. It is well worth the read!
B000OCZD5G|5.0|I am not going to bore you with saying I know everything about quality and imperfections. Enjoy the movie. It doesn't get any better then this.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|Starts off grand with Badu's sleek neo-soul vibe at it's best, continuing to truly earn her pay as a vocalist unlike most singers. When she starts to indulge her hip-hop side in the second half things really take a turn for the worse though, and we go from wonderful, breathy experimental grooves to corny Timbaland-esque bangers that just feel out of place for her class. Thankfully this was just a little midterm sampler to kind of gauge things artistically for her and I am sure she figured out what stuck after that.
B0015XASFS|5.0|fantastic cd and dvd there.  Josh is one of my favorite   performers...and he does it again in this new DVD.  Looking  forward to his next taped concert.
B0001I561E|5.0|A classic brought back in style. The dvd is better than ever and as enjoyable as the first time I saw the movie.
B00005JO5L|2.0|\\"Cruising\\" is a great, underrated movie, no doubt about that. Gay cult-filmmaker Bruce LaBruce was right when he wrote that no other film depicts the S&M-scene in NYC better than that film...there is just one big problem with this Special-Edition-DVD: William Friedkin couldn't resist tinkering with the visual style of the film. For example, he changed the colours, so that each scene either has a heavy blue-ish or green-ish tone to it. That looks silly and disturbs the realistic atmosphere of the film. Even more disastrously, he added visual effects to Pacino's famous dancing scene - probably to heighten the feeling that Pacino's character is getting crazy. (As if we didn't know). The problem is: those stroboscope-effects look horribly cheap and totally take you out of the scene. The scene was the emotional highlight of the film. Now it is the lowpoint. Friedkin ruined his own film. What a shame.
006088732X|4.0|A great ya read (even for an adult like me) that includes murder, mystery, drama, and even a bit of intrigue.  I kept wanting to pick this book up and read it, even when I was supposed to be doing something else.  The short chapters were great to read quick tidbits here and there and not be lost within a chapter.  I liked how after almost every text or email the story went back to the 7th grade time frame to explain what it meant then and how it linked to what was happening now.  I really enjoyed this book and cannot wait to get my hands on the rest of this series!!  :)

B00005JPNZ|4.0|Indy's back...and knees...and other aches and pains. You gotta admire a man willing to revisit a success in such a sacrificial way. It was easy to cheer him on even though the action had slowed a bit.<br /><br />Dry, droll and to-the-point, the older, wiser and classic Indy takes on the Russians, the feds and a mushroom cloud.<br /><br />Within this flick are unbelievable scenes...just as I expected. You have to be willing to go along for the ride and enjoy it. If you plan to take a notebook to record the moments you have to suspend disbelief, then don't go. Indy also delivers creepy crawlies and moldering corpses. A whole lot of bad guys guarantee the wild car chases and crashes. Indy has slowed down but he can still kick some serious bad guy rear end.<br /><br />Youthful foolishness and posturing is delivered by Mutt, Indy's new and not necessarily welcomed sidekick. But Indy has grown up and is ready to teach.<br /><br />Besides some of the miraculous saves, I didn't buy some of the too easily mended relationships, but other than that, this was a great, entertaining summer flick.
0894803123|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book before trying even one recipe.  This is the best recipe for Ice Cream that I have ever tried.  Once you know the basics, you can relax and enjoy making ice cream.  I don't wear my self out breaking eggs whipping whites and blending in order.  I just toss the ingrdients blend and freeze.  I haven't seen a bad batch since the time I used too much butter for butter pecan.  Even with that \\"gummy\\" batch, I received compliments.  Ain't that what its all about?
B000MQC9H4|3.0|Kate Winslet portrays Iris, a shy writer who has been carrying on a one-sided romance with a colleague. Heartbroken when he gets engaged, she decides she needs a change of scenery and trades homes for the holiday with Hollywood power player Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who also is nursing a broken heart. While Amanda finds romance with Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) in the English countryside, Iris falls for music composer Miles (Jack Black) in LA, while befriending Arthur (Eli Wallach), a lonely neighbor with ties to the golden age of Hollywood. But can either romance outlast the holiday?<br /><br />Winslet as always is enchanting, and overshadows Diaz, proving what a superior actress she is. Her performance is flawless and real, while Diaz overacts and over gestures her way through the entire script. Black makes an unlikely but believable romantic counterpart. Overall, it's an enjoyable romantic comedy with a pretty good ensemble cast.
0385333846|4.0|I can almost imagine the author sitting at his typewriter, his wallpaper outline in yellow crayon tacked on the wall, typing a line at a time--all the while wondering if this book would ever be finished.<br /><br />Because that is how it reads. It's random, with moments of brilliance. The first and last chapters were actually intro and epilogue, while Chapters 2 and beyond were the real \\"story\\". Characters may or may not play a part. A frozen hobo is a stark image, but what does it mean? Words and colors are interwoven - beginning with breath that reeks like mustard gas and roses, only to find it again in an underground tomb in Dresden. Like I said, brilliant--but random.<br /><br />I read it twice, and liked it better the second time.
B000AWYOGE|5.0|I loved the original of \\"Dark Water\\" and expected to be disappointed by this, as in the terrible remake of \\"Ring\\", but I was very pleasantly surprised to find this was a most excellent movie and better than the original, in that this one didn't leave in what seemed like unnecessary parts, which in the original seemed to drag in places, whereas this one never seemed to lose its atmosphere but continued on with its slow building feeling of dread. The original film seemed to include too much more going on, especially near the end, whilst this one kept things more minimal and was therefore more effective for it. Greatly conveyed the feeling of hopelessness and dampness, dripping water, always raining outside, dampness and more dampness, it was everywhere. Obviously very well thought out and full marks to the makers for creating the damp feel which was always there, so you always felt affected by it. Great movie.
B0001I55OC|3.0|This movie was a bit dissapointing because the special effects of the actual time travel of the group did not live up to what was described in the book but it was probably a bit too technical to put in as written and probably would have detracted from the main thrust of the movie to the viewing public.  Still, it wasn't a bad movie and hit all the main points of the book.
B0012QE4QC|3.0|While the movie was pretty good - Eric Bana is a great actor, it was not very faithful to Phillipa Gregory's book which was exceptional. If you are looking for a movie that is closer to the historical truth, I would go back to \\"Anne of a Thousand Days\\" that seems to be the definitive movie about Anne Boleyn.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|The movie watcher should not expect a scintillating plot from \\"Once\\" but the music lover will cherish the crux of the movie - the music.  With haunting melodies and intriguing timing, the music will stay in your mind for days.  You'll want to buy the soundtrack CD just to hear it as often as you can.  You will not be surprised that the song \\"Falling Slowly\\" won an Oscar for best original song in a movie in the 2007 Academy Awards.  Glen Hansard's beaten up and ragged looking guitar still makes wonderful music in his hands. His voice, along with Marketa Irglova's, combine beautifully to make the music unforgettable.
B00139W3NE|3.0|This movie is based on a book, the first book of a trilogy.  I have never read any of these books, and have no intention to, so this review is purely of the movie itself, as a standalone piece of entertainment.      First of, contrary to what some other reviews have suggested, there is minimal resemblance between this movie and the LOTR, Narnia, and Harry Potter movies of recent release.  Unlike LOTR, this movie is more intellectual and the conflicts more subtle and nuanced.  For example, the relationships between the protagonists and antagonists seem more complicated, with more twists and turns.  And instead of a focus on magic like in the Potter movies, this story rests on a background of other wordly technology.  The dress, speech and personal manners seem of Victorian time, yet some of the technology seem all too futuristic.  Probably the biggest difference between the Golden Compass and other recent fantasy tales is the former's use of females as the chief protagonist and antagonist.    This movie features the most distinguished cast of actors and actresses of any fantasy movie with names such as Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Sam Elliot, Christopher Lee and Ian McKellen.  Only the main character is fairly unknown.  It seems this movie's producers decided to hire an all-star cast to help take some weight of the main actress.  Does it work?  Partly.  Kidman's character seems perfectly tailored for the actress's skills, while everyone else could have been replaced with unknowns and the film quality would have stayed the same.      Probably the biggest failing of the movie was the soundtrack, or the lack of one.  The main song comes at the ending credits and is quite forgettable.  And there are no grand schemes anywhere thru the movie; though this is appropriate as there are no grand scenes anywhere thru the movie, which is probably the next biggest failing.  Every fantasy movie deserves a climax, that emotional peak to wow and exhaust the audience.  There is none in this movie.    There are two aspects of this movie that is all too familiar for fans of fantasy movies.  First is the abundance of British accents; even the bear has a British accent.  Second is the characterization of dark-skinned people as evil.  The movie features two groups of \\"bad guys\\", Tartars and Samoyeds.  The former come across as ruthless mercenaries, and the latter come across as criminals; both sets are shown to be orientals.  Interesting that the only non-white characters in this movie are all bad guys.  The Gyptians, which are supposed to be \\"good guys\\" are all white.  They are modeled after gypsies of real life, even though many gypsies come from Southern and Eastern Europe, and often have darker skin hues.    So overall, this movie is worth the two hours to watch on DVD; though not worth the price of a movie ticket.
0978606310|5.0|The guide is beautifully done, with clear pictures and fantastic organization. There is clearly a lot of research and work that has gone into this labor of love, and it shows.

As someone who owns both of Summer's books, I highly suggest getting one of your own--it's a great investment!
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|I've seen this movie about 50 times and it NEVER stops being funny! It's clean, it's silly, it's just a GREAT laugh without any ugliness or violence like everything THINKS it has to have today to be good. Cary Grant is totally out of his \\"leading man\\" character in this movie and he's fantastic! This shows no matter what he's asked to play, he's up for the challenge. Katherine Hepburn is one of my all time favorites and as always, she's at the top of her game as a fast talking, often confusing (to poor Cary's character), EVER hysterical, rich girl who seems to have lost her tiger. One of my favorite movie scenes is when she loses the back of her dress and he has to walk her through a restaurant close to her back so no one can see her \\" accident!\\" This movie is defintely worth watching over and over especially if you've had a bad day in the \\"real world\\" and want to escape to a rip roaring good time that's BOUND to make you giggle and make that bad day melt away!
B000A6T1KE|5.0|I had already seen this movie prior to buying it, but I would definitely watch it over and over again, and that is a requirement for me in order to purchase a DVD. Nice way to end it all off for the crew of the Enterprise, but alas the ending...It was nice to be able to see all the deleted scenes.  All in all a great movie for fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation.
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I am not going to make a big review on this, but come on. This has to be the worst film I've seen lately, I place this with \\"Be Kind Rewind\\" a very stupid and unpleasing movie!
B0007Y08PQ|2.0|I bought this movie believing I had never seen it, but it turns out I had watched the end half of it when it was on television. Imagine my surprise when I started getting deja vu! The plot of this movie was interesting, but it would have made for a better TV episode. The love story between the Baku woman and Picard would have been better left out of the film. It was interesting that the two races wound up being the same, though. The story was decent, the movie itself followed Star Trek: TNG's usual stories, but just not a good plot choice for a feature length film.  There wasn't really enough action for me. I'm not an expert movie critic, just my opinion.
B0012Q732O|1.0|After seeing this movie, I was itching my head because this is the same director that did \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\", \\"ID4\\" \\"STARGATE\\" How did this movie go so wrong. It tried to intimidate Frank Miller's 300. It fails badly.     If your desperate to watch a movie on a Friday night, please choose something else then 10,000 B.C. You will hurt afterwards if you do. Asking for your money and time back.
B001DDBCUA|4.0|Writer-director Michael Patrick King should be commended for reviving the popular HBO series as a legitimate theatrical feature - rather than creating an extended episode. \\"Sex and the City\\" (2008) emerges as a perceptive romantic comedy-drama that expands the TV-show parameters while maintaining the vital chemistry between Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. Judging by the phenomenal box-office success, loyal fans have not been disappointed. However, the overall film can proudly stand on its own merits.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|I think the first review I eagerly read for this movie, on MSN, was typical of what few negative reviews I read, almost as if the critics are competing over who gets to pan it first. I'm a 40 something guy. I LOVED<br />this movie, but I'm a HUGE Harrison Ford fan and an INDY fan so, I'm BIASED.<br />  First, for the GOOD aspects: Harrison Ford looks GOOD for a guy his age. He probably didn't do a lot of his stunts, but its hard to tell.<br />The actors do a FINE job, and the cinematography is NICE. I watched this film on a weekday afternoon matinee and got LOST in it. I LOVED the soundtrack, the snappy dialogue and the ACTION which was \\"almost\\" nonstop.<br />You can't take the movie too seriously. Some people do and that's why they wind up very disappointed. It's FUN. Cate Blanchett is in the movie too and is FINE as a Russian villain. John Hurt, an actor I think is ALWAYS GOOD, is great too. I LOVED it! Not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but better then the Temple of Doom.<br />  Does it break new ground? No...but why mess with what works so WELL?<br />I thought George and Steve crafted a great RIDE of a movie. My only complaint is some plodding parts of the movie early on, but when the action starts, it GOES!<br />  Maybe I'm showing my age, but I love seeing actors I grew up watching like Harrison Ford, prove they are still KICKING. He DID.<br />Shia LeBoeuf is GOOD in the movie and enetertaining, as is Karen Allen.<br />I will buy it on DVD, but meanwhile i plan to see it again. ENJOY!<br />As for anyone who is desperately searching for groundbreaking movies,<br />search on!  Atreides
0767827791|5.0|Having seen Picnic on television years ago and then having it disappear not to be shown again I wanted to find a copy of it. I was happy to see that it had been reissued! Even though the film is not in widescreen format(a big disappointment)it is a trip through some very simple and nostalgic times. Loaded with wonderful character acters and soon to be big stars it almost makes you want to relive the 50's. I could relate to many of the characters as being people that I had grown up around. Verna Felton was wonderful, but then so was William Holden and Rosalind Russell. If you want to escape from our complicated world and have a few hours of nostalgia I highly recommend Picnic.
6305907145|3.0|If you enjoy Edwardian drama that lets everything hang out, this film may be to your taste. It makes strong statements about infidelity, class relations, race relations. It's very much a 'tell all' of the rich and famous of that time. For that point, it's interesting.    My chief complaint is the story is not as faithful to Jane Austen's work as it should be.  There are so many ways this film differs from Jane Austen's version.  Bluntly, it all comes down to the producer hammering watchers over the head with concepts such as slavery, infidelity, etc. that were touched on lightly in Austen's book.

B000UVV2DS|3.0|The firts two songs are so tacky. Even the Dio's songs was silly. But when the BAND come to stage... getting better!
B00168OINK|3.0|By day, Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black) struggles as a waiter in his father's noodle shop.  But he dreams of being a kung fu warrior.    When he learns the Dragon Warrior is finally going to be named, he rushes to the temple and by accident ends up at the end of the Ooway the Ancient Turtle's (voice by Randall Duk Kim) pointing finger when he makes the proclamation. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his five fighting pupils are all dismayed at the choice, but Ooway advises them there are no accidents.      Finally, when the snow leopard Tai Ling (Ian McShane) breaks out of jail and comes to wreak his vengeance on teh valley, Shifu agrees to help Po learn to fight.  All he needs is to believe in himself and work hard...    Dreamworks has done a great job with the CGI for this film. The animation is smooth and the characters really do seem real.  The Chinese countryside is beautiful as well.      Clearly, from the video games and plush toys you can find on Amazon, this movie may well be a contender for largest sales of related products.  The movie itself is entertaining for kids of all ages.     Rebecca Kyle, June 2008
B00005JPNY|5.0|If you have an ax to grind, or a sacred cow to protect, then everything you see may be filtered through your dogmatic lenses.  How do persons submit reviews while being proud that they never saw the movie or read the book--and never intend to?  My family watched the movie with open minds to be entertained.  We were.   Having never heard of the books, I cannot compare the movie to the pages, but I thought the movie did an excellent job of telling the FIRST part of a trilogy.  I was happy to have my daughter watching the courageous young Lyra  as a role model.  My son and daughter each have the book now (a single volume, available from Amazon, UK), and I have learned how a misunderstanding led to \\"the Golden Compass\\" title.   If you are able to enjoy a fantasy epic without bringing your own baggage into it, then I recommend this movie as Part One of what looks like a fantastic tale.  The bonus features will impress you with the level of detail, inspiration, and authenticity that went into this production.
B000A6T262|5.0|I've enjoyed having these high-quality widescreen DVD copies of the the Star Trek movies -- especially since these kinds of movies have always been visually intense.  They look & sound really good on my home theater.  -- Roger
0385340567|1.0|I'm about 1/2 way through this book and am having trouble going any farther. I've read all of the other Reacher books and liked some more then others. But this one is going nowhere. It doesn't capture any of the charm, fun, adventure, etc. that Child's previous works did. The more I read on, the more disillusioned, bored and frustrated I get...it's like work, bad work at that. I always looked forward to another Jack Reacher adventure, but now I know I'll wait for the paperback edition IF I ever read another Reacher book again.
B00006LPER|5.0|This one mixes classical music and weird sexual perversion. I didn't know whether to chuckle or take it seriously. It is one of the more surreal movies you'll ever watch, debate or not about what it says about women and men. Very French, and by that I mean minimal, yet saying a lot, or seeming to, anyway. The whole thing is pretty senseless, in the end, I thought. The mother-daughter scenes will make you wince, or worse.
0786948523|5.0|After many years and hard spent money on a broken system, which they relased an errata update to nearly every month if not every other week, and lets not forget they completely overhauled the polymorph spell because in late 2007 they finally figured out it was way too powerful (after wizards and sorcerers were changing into dragons and destroying many a DM's plot).<br /><br />Now we have a more streamlined, more thought provoking game!<br />I do get where the 2nd ed and 3.0/3.5 ed people who don't like 4th ed are coming from, after all, I learned D&D via 3.0/3.5 so I know of no other system to play it. However, I also know 3.5 is a system that has a lot of flaws, mostly due to every new sourcebook released adding so many new rules that they finally had to release a sourcebook with just rules in it (as if three core rulebooks weren't enough, which turns out they weren't).<br /><br />Yes, I admit, I don't like they turned Gnomes into Monsters, but in the end, the vast majorty of players didn't play Gnomes, they would pick the odder races (like my favoret, the Dragonborn, which I am totally excited to see as a standard race now).<br /><br />I can't wait, I ordered all three books and will be getting them this Monday, so 48 hours from now, I'll be running 4th Ed. D&D games from Monday on. ^_^ My 3.0/3.5 books will still be put to use as I haven't ended my still young 3.5 campaign yet....
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|You're expected to believe that a bunch of high school students are capable of running an elaborate drug dealing cartel, all the while never appearing to ever go to class. The plot is muddled and the dialogue is slow and dull. It takes a long time to begin to make sense, trying the patience of any viewer. Adults don't seem to exist in this world. And the exposition at the end by the two main characters is so complicated and absurd that it exposes how weak the script is by having them recite and explain to the viewer what just took place over 90 minutes.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|The character of Indiana Jones is loved by millions. A character played to perfection by Harrison Ford in the first movie installment, Raiders of the Lost Ark.    After the success of Raiders, George Lucas then made the brilliant decision to hand screenplay duties for the sequel (Temple of Doom) over to his old college buddies (Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz). To say that the screenplay for Temple of Doom was a pathetic, poorly written, stinker of mega proportions, would be too kind. Lucas of course must have been very happy with the screenplay, because he then handed the writing, producing, and even directing duties for his next major project over to Huyck and Katz. That project was of course, Howard the Duck! We all know how that turned out.    Thanks to screenwriter Jeffrey Boam, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was a huge step in the right direction. Not on par with \\"Raiders\\", but quite enjoyable. But the story doesn't end there....    Nearly twenty years later, George Lucas finally delivers a fourth installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. If nothing else, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" will leave viewers with one glaring question. \\"Is it possible that Temple of Doom is no longer the worst Indiana Jones film?\\". Well, it might just be a draw!    So how did it come to this?    The simple fact of the matter is, George Lucas is a moron. He refused screenplays by Jeffrey Boam (Last Crusade) and Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption) in favor of the garbage written by the over-rated screenwriting HACK David Koepp (Secret Window, Stir of Echoes, and other such trash). From what I heard of the Frank Darabont screenplay, it was brilliant! But, leave it to tubby George Lucas to crank out the trash. Perhaps all that fat has gone to his brain?    So what's the problem?    [SPOILER WARNING]  skip the following paragraph if you don't want anything revealed    Where to begin? Surviving a nuclear blast in a refrigerator. Swinging on vines through the jungle like Tarzan and catching up to a speeding convoy (with a bunch of monkeys following you). Giant ants? Who needs Niagara falls in a barrel, when you can go over THREE such falls in a jeep and live to tell about it! There really isn't enough room for me to list everything, so I'll just stop there. Did I mention a plot with more holes than freakin' Swiss cheese?    [END OF SPOILER WARNING]     Sure, it was great to see Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones again. But, this movie is just plain PAINFUL to watch. Honestly, this is just as bad, if not worse than Temple of Doom! I will not purchase the DVD when released.    Raiders of the Lost Ark was a film that set the bar for action-adventure films at a very high mark. \\"Crystal Skull\\" was an opportunity to deliver a film that takes back the reigns from the CGI infested, twinky filled, wanna-be's of the last 20 years. Instead, it simply joins the fold of wretched summer movies that play more like video games on speed, rather than entertaining and fun \\"adventure\\" films.    Maybe George Lucas can hire David Koepp to write and direct Howard the Duck 2, the Beaquel.    JM
B0011HF6GE|4.0|The album \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" is simply a breath of fresh air. I have never heard anything like it. I read in a magazine article how Bon Iver had been compared to Iron and Wine, and I love I&W, so I decided to check out the album. I was amazed at the pure vulnerability that is heard on this record. Reading the lyrics and listening to the songs are the best way to experience this one of a kind, genuinely original sound.
B0018CWEYY|3.0|In my opinion, if someone compiled a list of the top ten drama TV series of all time, LOST would rank in the top THREE. The first season delivered a quality of writing, acting and overall execution not seen in most big budget Hollywood movies, let alone a weekly series. While it did falter for an episode or two within the following two seasons, there is no denying that LOST always quickly recouped and delivered enough substance and sheer brilliance to draw the viewer back into the \\"zone\\". The fact that such a high level of output was consistently maintained for THREE YEARS is an astonishing achievement. Another astonishing, and quite unfortunate achievement is how a series of this stature could be reduced to comic book schlock within a very short period of 14, poorly conceived and written \\"season four\\" episodes.    Here's what I used to tell people who had never seen lost....    \\"If you have avoided LOST on the assumption that it's sci-fi nonsense, or a simple survival tale, you have judged incorrectly. The character depth is remarkable, the acting superb, and the plot is MIND BENDING. If you're a viewer who enjoys sitting back and watching a series such as \\"24\\", thinking that you've reached the pinnacle of quality television, I urge you to watch the first few episodes of LOST. You'll never look at another TV show in quite the same way.\\"    After watching the poorly written and executed season four, I can no longer make such a bold statement. In an effort to wrap up some of the mystery surrounding the first three seasons, the writers have chosen a direction that places character depth secondary to silly sci-fi nonsense. A truly powerful and unique human drama filled with mystery and intrigue has been reduced to entertainment for simpletons.    > SPOILER WARNING <  Do not read beyond this point if you don't want basic plot points revealed.    Within the first three seasons, we were all treated to various \\"mysteries\\", that may or may not have had \\"sci-fi\\", \\"scientific\\", or \\"spiritual\\" tinged answers. Each new mystery was carefully constructed and thoughtfully intertwined with the development of each individual character. The perfectly balanced combination of mystery and character development became the CORE of Lost. Unfortunately, within season four, heavy handed writing destroys most of the fragile plot line developed within the first three seasons. Even the plot structure is discarded in a few episodes. Season four hits the viewer between the eyes with nonsense and outlandish situations, which are almost entirely devoid of mystery.     Ghosts? Yes, they exist. Time travel? Yes, not a problem. Time/Space travel? Of course! Oh, and the mysterious \\"smoke monster\\" can be controlled from a hidden room (Jeeez, how pathetic)! The island can be \\"moved\\" by turning a big wheel (of course). Let's also throw in an old as dirt plot device (like trying to disarm a bomb before it explodes), and then throw in some Rambo-like soldiers as bad guys (to get more action into the series)! Characters became CARICATURES as the center of attention shifts to a silly comic book \\"war\\" between \\"Ben\\" and Charles Widmore (who are perhaps a couple of time/space travellers).    For a while, I was concerned that the resolution of LOST might ultimately disappoint by being a bit too reminiscent of various movie plot lines (Vanilla Sky, the Fountain, Dark City, What Dreams May Come, Twelve Monkeys, etc.). But now, if the series proceeds in the direction that season four has laid out, LOST isn't even in the league of many of those films. Instead, we might end up comparing it to something of the ilk of Highlander. Sad indeed!    I'm sure that lots of viewers have simply given up on the series after the silly revelations of season four. I'm still looking forward to season five, but am less than hopeful that the writers can fix all that they have destroyed. Instead of thoughtful, well written character development intertwined with just the right amount of mystery, I'll be expecting more dumb action scenes and silly comic book plots.    How the mighty fall.    JM    P.S.    Of course, many viewers might choose to think of season three as the END of the series. The rest, might be better off left to the imagination of the viewer (which might provide a far more interesting conclusion). I'm also sure that many fan-fiction writers can come up with something much more pleasing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Gather around folks, for the tale of the Brave little Firefly who fought the battle and lost, but who still lives on in our hearts, to remind us of the great show, to ruin our spoken grammar (for who can resist to talk like our heroes after watching but one episode), and to give us all a love for Chinese clothing and culture.     It was a small little thing, then the evil corrupt foxes (of FOX), decided to declare war on the little show.  And lo, the young show tried to fight back and conform to the evil empire's whishes. And so pander they did! Make the captain more joyful, have the hooker be bi-sexual, naked scenes ahoy! But it was not enough, for the villainous fox had already tasted the young show's blood.     They trapped them in their own cruel game of cat and mouse, forcing the show to fight for its life. Putting it on in random time-slots, airing the pilot last, and blaming it all on the show. So when they cancelled, many did weep. For the young creature that held so much potential that was so brutally slain.     Weep for the poor and precious show, but do not think that this is its finial end. For there is a new hope, for the fans of brave little Firefly, who showed such strong support for this show, that they where able to have a movie made in its honor, the spawn of Firefly, the great and lovely Serenity.     So weep for this show, and curse the villainous Fox, but do not forget because if you buy these DVDs, you too can shout.     \\"I don't care I'm still free.   You can't take my firefly from me.\\"
B00169XU8I|5.0|[[ASIN:B00169XU8I Hard Candy Special Edition [Candy Box]]]<br /><br />Incredible CD.  Deluxe Edition is definately for the die-hard Madonna fans.  The packaging is great but it could have had bonus songs, other than remixes of 4 Minutes, or videos of some sort.  If I wanted remixes of 4 Minutes I would have bought the maxi single.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|The Seldom Seen Kid is another nail in the coffin for any British band that isn't Radiohead or Blur. Elbow is the most consistent and impressive of the more recent British bands and Seldom Seen Kid puts forward, once again, clear proof that they are underappreciated. Guy Garvey is an awesome lyricist with lines like \\"The violets explode inside me when I meet your eyes Then I'm spinning and I'm diving Like a cloud of starlings... Darling is this love?\\" Accompanied by the build of the music, you truly get the sense of the powerful feelings put into this song. That is from \\"Starlings.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mirrorball\\" is another earnest love song that is really impressive. \\"You make the moon a mirrorball - The streets an empty stage - The city's sirens, violins - Everything has changed.\\" The words cleverly and convincingly speak of passion and magic in a way that not many pop acts can pull off.<br /><br />While those two songs are quiet ballads, songs like \\"Grounds for Divorce\\" pick up the pace a bit with wailing vocals and a dirty rythmn. \\"The Fix\\" is a cabaret-esque number and \\"Audience With the Pope\\" does its best smokey lounge act impression. The album is full of variety but, like other Elbow albums, has a consistently dark edge to it. The arrangements are all very solid, polished, and sophisticated, to match the top-notch lyrics. They use lots of different instruments and shift styles with ease... All to the betterment of each song.<br /><br />It certainly takes repeated listens to get the most out of The Seldom Seen Kid, but that's what makes the best albums and all of Elbow's albums grow considerably better with familiarity. Give it a shot and sit with it a while. It's pretty darned good.
0452289963|5.0|Even though I wrote this review, my advice to anyone reading it is: don't decide whether to read this book based upon reviews. Put simply, the book will either speak to you or it won't, and either way it's okay. Tolle himself says as much in Chapter 1. You won't know until you read it yourself, so someone else's opinion is irrelevant.    If you're interested in opinions anyway, for me, it's as if Tolle's words were deposited directly into my heart. The same thing happened when I read The Power of Now]years ago, but revisiting the message as it's presented in this book was what I needed to begin integrating this teaching into my life. The effect has been extraordinary. I think anyone on a spiritual journey of any type should at least attempt to read this book. It certainly can't hurt.    I know a lot of people steer clear of \\"Oprah\\" books, but in this case, I hope that doesn't have the effect of turning people off. Tolle's intention with the book is to reach people as individuals, wherever they are in their journey and whenever the message will resonate. That means you don't have to participate in the Oprah classes to \\"get it.\\"

B000NVL9KG|5.0|I should start this review by pointing out that I am reviewing this album based on the K2HD AND the MFSL versions that I own & NOT the one for sale from SHOUT Factory.  I consider the two versions cited to be definitive examples of the state-of-the-art recording, at their respective times and that we do not need to dwell upon their respective audiophile tweakish differences - on which I could expound, boringly & probably boorishly for hours.    What I would like to say about this album, and most notably the title \\"track\\", is that this is probably Emerson's most \\"complete\\" work, to date (since I haven't heard his soon to be released KEB album due in July 2008).  Keith's Piano Concerto was a work from the heart, which I feel will stand the test of time, but TARKUS (the suite) is a truly thematically complete work, from a man whom his own band-mates, of many years, accuse of \\"... never finishing anything...\\".  It is impossible to categorize - it's not rock, it's not jazz, it's not classical - it's Emerson, with a fair shake of the highly talented Mr. Palmer for flavor (I'm not including Mr. Lake as I feel that this piece stands alone as an extremely powerful instrumental piece).  From the furious intro of Eruption to the sombre and unsettling Battlefield, this piece moves me like few pieces of music in my 50+ years have done.  I recently found out that it has been arranged for trombone and orchestra and will likely be picked up by other major orchestras for arrangement.  THIS is what struck me most as an adolescent when I first picked up and heard this album - the title track was so HUGE in sound - it needed an orchestra. This arrangement - by a 3 piece band - still sounds like a full orchestra, even 37 years ago.  This is a must have for any true music lover.    By the way, most of the other material is darned good, too - even the \\"throw-away\\" tracks like \\"Jeremy Bender\\" and \\"Are You Ready Eddy\\".

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have tried many headphones that all hurt my ears.  I've never found in-the-ear ones that didn't hurt after 10 minutes.  I've also tried the sport sony headphones that clip around your hear, but they are too big so they always jump around or fall off when I run.    These headphones are the first ones I've found that don't hurt my ears at all, even if I'm at the gym for 1 1/2 hours.  Some people complained in reviews that the ear part is sharp and scratches your ear-I didn't have this problem at all.  Others complained that the cord is too short-but I disagree if you are short.  I am only 5'2\\" and feel that most cords are far too long, so these are the perfect length for me.  Overall, I think these are great headphones.
B000002BQK|4.0|I must say that Mariah Carey took a turning point and switched genres. Before this album, I would classify her music as R&B/Pop. And From Buttefly to [[ASIN:B000UMKCYC E=MC2]], I would classify her music as Hip-Hop/R&B. And While her music has been good since this album, it hasn't been the same Mariah introduced in 1990.    1. [[ASIN:B000002DBR Honey]] is a hip-hop-ish song using samples and production by Sean Combs (Which, when working with Puffy/Diddy, you're most likely to get samples). Sean Combs speaks too much on this track. Plus, it seems a little too sexualized compared to Mariah's material on her previous 4 (Not counting the Holiday Album) albums. 4.5/10  2. \\"Butterfly\\" - A classic MC track which reminds me of the MC I was introduced to in 1990. 9/10  3. \\"Whenever You Call\\" Same as Butterfly - 9.5/10  4. [[ASIN:B000006EC6 Breakdown]] - A Hip-hop track with Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone but it works just like the O.D.B. (RIP) remix to \\"Fantasy\\" - 7.75/10  5. Beautiful Ones - A great Prince Remake with Dru Hill - 10/10  6. My All - A great soulful track reminding me of her previous material.    Butterfly and [[ASIN:B00002MZ1X Rainbow]] seem very hip-hop orientend and it make me wonder if she'll ever release another [[ASIN:B000LXBA7S Vision Of Love]]. Don't get me wrong, Mariah still releases good music, it's just not as good as her first 4 albums (Not counting [[ASIN:B000BC8TBE Merry Christmas]]). It's still a good album but it's not worthy of a full 4 stars
1402210795|4.0|Is it because of the extremely funny dialog? Or the well-rounded characters, both primary and secondary? Perhaps it's the sweetness behind the story, in which a heedless young rake has to grow up in a hurry, after marrying a bright but innocent teenager who can't manage high society without a little guidance. Maybe those throwaway lines, which don't necessarily further the plot, but provide endless entertainment, are what stick with you. Whatever the charms, and they are many, this book will find a place on your Keeper shelf.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|You are made of sterner stuff than me if you can read Luttrell's eulogy to his fallen comrades without tearing up. I found the book to be fast paced, exciting and heartrending.  Luttrell is a man of action, and his voice is simple, forceful and direct.  I suspect some readers will object to Luttrell laying the blame for the death of his comrades at the feet of overly restrictive rules of engagement, which he says have been forced on the military by liberal media and lawyers.
1402210086|4.0|Everyone loves an alpha hero, whether he's a Duke or a Navy SEAL. Everyone loves competence, good looks, and a quick wit. In \\"Cotillion\\", you will find yourself rooting for the very antithesis of those heroes. Freddy is a total Beta. He isn't very quick on the uptake, hasn't any particular wit, and, although he dresses in the height of Regency fashion, his appearance is one of amiable vacuity...or a startled rabbit, when circumstances get out of hand, as they so frequently do. What Freddy does have, in abundance, is warmth, kindness, generosity, and a willingness to go out of his comfort zone to extricate his pretend-fiance, Kitty, from the predicaments her impulsivity launches her into.    Freddy grows on you as the book progresses. From being Kitty's dupe to becoming her savior, you will savor the charms of Mr. Nice Guy, Regency-era version. There are delightful subplots, with a host of well-rounded characters: Lord Dolphinton, the lackwitted cousin who is terrified of his mother and in love with a bourgeoise woman; the Chevalier, Kitty's French cousin who falls for a lovely damsel being groomed for a life as a courtesan; and Freddy's father, who is actually one of the alpha males we would normally expect.     I believe there are superior books by Heyer: Frederica, The Grand Sophy, and Venetia, to name a few. But you shouldn't miss Cotillion, because it is such a triumph for Nice Guys everywhere, as well as being incredibly funny.
1416562591|5.0|Hilarious, moving, smart, captivating. Like other reviewers here, I read slowly, hoping it wouldn't end.<br /><br />My favorite quality: the consistent smartness and edginess in each line. It's hard to write a comic novel that's funny from start to finish, but Adiga succeeds. Incredibly, it's also social commentary.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This was the first Muse album I heard,  and was blown away.  I could not stop listening to Blackout.  It is the most amazing song I have heard in a long time.  It is subtle song with Russion sound to it.  The band is very inovative. They know how to make each song different and insteresting.  That whole album made a Muse fan forever.  It made me go out and buy Black Holes. It too is amazing and brillant. Apocalpse Please, the first song is intense and never lets go.  And the album ends with Ruled By Secrecy,  which is a very soft and pretty. Matt Belamy's voice is soft and caresses each lyric.  This albums stands as one of my all time favs.
B000G759LW|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Christina fan. I think she's an incredibly talented young lady with a powerhouse voice. However, the theme of this album is suppose to be a tribute to traditional jazz and blues music from the 20's, 30's, and 40's. Christina has openly said that she wanted this album to reflect on old jazz music. However, the album only achieves this on 2 or 3 tracks. \\"Candyman\\" and \\"I Got Trouble\\" sound like authentic jazz tunes that could've been recorded in the 1940's. \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" is a sultry, seductive song that sounds like it's straight out of a 1920's burlesque strip show. The rest of the album is filled with up-tempo pop tracks (Slow Down Baby, Aint No Other Man), sappy love songs (Save Me From Myself, The Right Man), overdone vocals (Hurt, Mercy On Me), and filler tracks that don't stand out at all (On Our Way, Without You). With a 2 disc album, I expected much more from Christina.     The main problem I have with this album is its lack of continuity. If you're going to aim for a specific theme on an album, stick with it throughout the entire thing. Christina wanted to pay homage to jazz, but she didn't do a very good job. The 2 opening tracks of the cd talk about how she's going to \\"go back to basics to where it all began\\", but this album hardly does that at all. It doesn't achieve what it sought out to do, and that's the biggest disappointment of all. Christina had a great idea with this album, and if done correctly I think it could've been fanatastic. But it was misdirected and poorly executed. Good idea in theory, but done all wrong.
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|The Canon CP-E4 battery pack holds 8 AA batteries and provides the active professional and semi-pro photographers the ability to shoot hundreds of flash photos before re-loading batteries. Mine has seen moderate use for 4-1/2 years, and still looks great, works as well as day 1, and I expect will continue to provide service for many more years.<br /><br />Pros<br />* Provides 12 AA batteries total (8 in this pack, 4 in your 580EX II or other high-end speedlite) for many hours of shooting<br />* Includes two mounting methods (belt and velcro strap for a stand or bracket)<br />* Ballistic nylon construction is very tough, essentially indestructible for what photographers do<br />* Case has two closures (snap and velcro)<br />* Provided 1/4-20 screw to mount it to your rack<br />* Internal plastic case is tough and will withstand abuse when housed in the protective nylon case<br />* The internal plastic case can be reversed so the coiled power cable comes out either the left or right side of the nylon case<br />* Refresh rate is extremely high with fresh batteries (especially NiMH, which are ideal for flash refresh)<br /><br />Cons<br />* High price but worth it for a buy-once, use-forever item<br />* Provides only one output (fine for single 580EX II or higher users, but if you have two such flashes, you need two battery packs)<br />* Lacks a semi-sticky surface directly below the strap side, to keep it from sliding down a light stand (can be remedied, of course, but Canon should have done this for us)<br />* The battery case (the hard plastic inner one) cannot be top-bottom reversed so the power lead comes out at the snap side. It only exits at the Velcro side, which essentially requires you to make some noise when you remove it.<br /><br />Other thoughts<br />This has helped me take thousands of shots and I don't do a wedding or other event without it. Be aware that with so much juice in the pack, you can fry your flash. This isn't a fault of the battery pack, so it's not in the Cons list. This battery pack has a couple of flaws that Canon should have engineered out, but for the most part I'm quite pleased.<br /><br />This is not a con... just a note: this unit will not power a 430EX or 430EX II.

B0017VG69U|5.0|I rate this season box set 5 stars for one reason, the \\"Doomsday Machine\\" episode alone. The new the special effects should confince you to pre order right now. When I saw this episode air on TV a few months ago. I kept checking to see if and when the box set will be released. You will not be diappointed when you purchase it.  When I get done with this review I am ordering mine.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|On time, great shape - have watched it several times since I received it.  A very good flick.
B00008EY9G|2.0|I don't blame the actors or the talented director who guided this confusing mess through an endless series of contrived and mindless twists and turns. Nope. The problem clearly is just this: the script is entirely B.S.    Those who liked Usual Suspects (a film I thoroughly hated) and who enjoy the work of Hitchcock (a director who never did anything for me) ought to get off on this fakery.    Like I said, cast is very good, with the exception of Jake Busey.
0553805460|2.0|I was kind of disapointed because after reading it I felt like many other readers. I thought the book was going to be about something totally different. Well, Because it starts out VERY interesting, I thought it was going to be a book about a young man's rise to power, and THEN his downfall. (i mean, i sat in barnes and nobles and read the book jacket as well as 2 whole chapters before I decided to buy the darn thing!) Anyway, it was not what I expected when i got home. It was just a story spanning a few hectic years of his life. Who Cares? Okay, maybe I would not be so upset if I did not feel so mislead at the begining.<br />The book was well written and had some interesting parts, some boring parts, and some were just pure insanity. And his obsessions with everything including his own wife were really funny! I really do not think that this is the whole story, without giving away too much, i just don't, so much does not fit, or make any sense.<br />I title my review \\"not surprising\\" because as I read the book, I realized that he is a con artist, a liar, cheater, scum bag sales man, so OF COURSE he sold me this book!! LOL!!!  that is the only reason it even got 2 stars! Bravo! Jordan, another triumph for you!
B0001XALT6|5.0|Sly plays a human being for a change--and I dug the hell out of it. He only raises his voices once--during a shouting match with the always convincing Ray Liotta.  Entire cast is amazing. You know who they are, so there is no need to list all the names.    Smartly written and directed by the talented James Mangold. This is a real movie (for grownups) and not some mindless shoot-'em up.   Mangold, as writer, first and foremost, understands the importance of strong character development and the stories he tries to tell (usually) have substance and are about something.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I bought this dvd based on the trailer viewed on another dvd which gave the impression that it was going to be a movie about a heartbroken mother who wanted her child back, a dedicated sleuth who looks for the child, racing against time and maybe a gang of sickos.  It was pretty shocking to discover that the biggest sicko in the movie was the mother herself. I'm not going to go through the plot and actors and so on since so many other reviewers have done that.  I want to talk about something else.<br /><br />I noticed the opening monologue, but didn't realize that this was the big clue to how the movie was going to end until it was a done deal.  At the beginning, Casey Affleck as Patrick Kenzie, says in a voiceover:<br /><br />\\"I always believed it was the things you don't choose that makes you who you are. Your city, your neighborhood, your family. People here take pride in these things, like it was something they'd accomplished. The bodies around their souls, the cities wrapped around those. I lived on this block my whole life; most of these people have. When your job is to find people who are missing, it helps to know where they started. I find the people who started in the cracks and then fell through. This city can be hard. When I was young, I asked my priest how you could get to heaven and still protect yourself from all the evil in the world. He told me what God said to His children. \\"You are sheep among wolves. Be wise as serpents, yet innocent as doves.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, he was neither; he was just naive and brainwashed by his religious tendencies and this is what led to the very disturbing ending: the destruction of many lives - including that of the child herself - because one man was so hung up on rules that he could not see that there is good, there is evil, and there is the specific situation that determines which is which.  For Patrick Kenzie - as for George Bush and other authoritarian personalities - things are black and white and this black and white thinking literally destroyed any possibility that he could see his way to make the RIGHT decision.<br /><br />And yes, in my opinion, he made the wrong decision.  That, of course, does not mean that I think that the cops involved in the \\"benevolent abduction\\" did the right thing either; they clearly did not. But life is never so simple as the Patrick Kenzie's of the world would like to think. Sometimes very hard decisions have to be made in very conflicting situations, and most often, the conflicts are the result of cognitive dissonance created by our programmed belief systems that often do not serve as adequate models of reality.<br /><br />The main problem of Kenzie's choice is that it was a choice based on an artificial construct: morality, rather than on conscience.  Oh, of course, he THOUGHT it was his conscience, but he made it clear in his opening monologue that true conscience had nothing to do with it when he said: \\"I always believed it was the things you don't choose that makes you who you are.\\"<br /><br />Nobody chooses to be born in Boston as opposed to Beijing.<br /><br />When talking about morality, the idea of good and evil can be very different for different people with different beliefs. That means it is subjective rather than objective. And here I use these terms in the sense that objective means \\"the way the Universe with its comprehensive perspective views itself\\" as opposed to the way an individual or even a group of individuals may view events in the universe.<br /><br />It could even be said that no one ever does anything deliberately in the interests of evil, for the sake of evil, per se, but rather that everyone acts in the interests of good, _as he understands it_! But everybody understands it in a different way! As a result of these subjective views of evil, human beings inflict all kinds of suffering on others in the interests of what they consider to be good.  That's the dilemma portrayed in this movie, whether accidentally or intentionally.<br /><br />George Bush, killing a million Iraqis in order to \\"force democracy\\" on them is one example. Israel occupying Palestine based on the claims of their religion, and committing genocide on the Palestinian people is another example.<br /><br />What we see, then, is that there is no morality common to all. One set of moral precepts can - and often does - contradict another set. What is moral in Boston may not be moral in Beijing. What is moral in Helsinki, may not be moral in Ethiopia. What is moral in Judaism, is not necessarily moral in Christianity or Islam.  What is moral to the lowest classes - generally controlled very well by religious beliefs - is not necessarily moral to the educated classes.<br /><br />Morality is more directly related to rules and laws, black and white interpretations of what is good and bad. Two very moral men from different cultures may consider each other very immoral. More than that, the more `moral' a person is, the more `immoral' will he think other moral people from different cultures!<br /><br />In this case, Patrick Kenzie thought of himself as a VERY moral person and he saw the cops, who had taken a child of the lower classes to raise as very immoral.  They weren't, though certainly their methods of going about doing what they did were extremely questionable.  (It's even questionable that anybody would ever actually do something like that - but that is a plot problem that others have addressed.)<br /><br />The problem is that we do not need morality, we need conscience since conscience is the interior connection between all normal humans (those who are not pathological).  The mother, in this movie, was clearly pathological.<br /><br />The idea of conscience is based on a different interpretation of reality, one that does not necessarily include hard and fast rules that apply in every situation such as our culture espouses under the influence of Judao-Christian influences. Conscience is reflected in a much older system that existed among many tribes of Celts before it was overcome and destroyed by the imposition of Judao-Christianity (by force).<br /><br />The destruction of Celtic culture was so complete that we know very little about their religion - we have to infer principles from rags and tatters of evidence. We do know that they celebrated their \\"rites\\" in forests and by lakes without erecting any covered temples or statues of divinities. Tacitus tells us:<br /><br />\\"They do not think it in keeping with the divine majesty to confine gods within walls, or to portray them in the likeness of any human countenance. Their holy places are woods and groves and they apply the names of deities to that hidden presence which is seen only by the eyes of reverence.\\"<br /><br />Plato had doubts about the Greek origins of Homer's work because not only do the physical descriptions in his poems not correspond to the Greek world, but also the Homeric philosophy is very different from the mainstream Greek philosophy we know about today. The latter is based on the dualism of two opposing elements, thesis/antithesis, good/evil, life/death, body/soul, etc. This is also the perspective of the related Judao-Christian system - at least as it has come to be known in our modern world. It could be said that the early Jesus people were more in tune with the ancient Celtic system as is evidenced by their God of Mercy. But that's before the gospel writers came on the scene and created myths. (See Burton Mack's \\"A Myth of Innocence\\" for detailed analysis.)<br /><br />Since Plato's times, many have sought to derive \\"synthesis\\" from opposing elements, with little success.<br /><br />According to Homer, the philosophy of the ancient world was that there was a third element that linked the opposing elements. Between the body and the soul, there is the spirit. Between life and death there is the transformation that is possible to the individual, between father and mother there is the child who takes the characteristics of both father and mother, and between good and evil there is the SPECIFIC SITUATION that determines which is which and what ought to be done.<br /><br />In other words, there are three simultaneous determinants in any situation that make it impossible to say that any list of things is \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\" intrinsically, and that the true determinant is the situation.<br /><br />In any event, the symbol of this philosophy is the triskele, representing three waves joined together.<br /><br />The simultaneous existence of the third element does not mean that the notion of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" did not exist or was not reflected in the Celtic law. What was clear was that it was understood that nothing could be \\"cut and dried\\" in terms of law, that each situation was unique and the circumstances had to be carefully weighed.<br /><br />And so, considering the Third Force, the specific situation, I would suggest that what the cops did was definitely evil; but what Kenzie did afterward, was also evil.  The whole movie was about evil, authoritarian personalities all of whom, in one way or another, were engaged in efforts to use other people for some, even the best of aims (according to the view of the individual initiating the action), without their knowledge and understanding.  Manipulating others, using others, either by producing in them faith or by acting upon them through fear, is evil. It seems to me that depriving people of knowledge, and inducing their compliance or participation to the aims of someone with a subjective morality, under conditions of what can even be called brainwashing, is what is the essence of evil. To deceive naive people and produce in them faith, infatuation, enthusiasm, and even fanaticism for subjective aims - even if the person subjectively thinks those aims are \\"good\\" - is evil authoritarianism.<br /><br />The authoritarian personality comes in two flavors: the top dogs and the followers, and the two types are motivated differently even if both are under the heading of \\"Authoritarian Personality.\\"  The reason for this is that it takes the followers to support the top dogs and together, they make a social structure that seems to be a part of any society to one extent or another.  It is only when such a structure begins to dominate that society as a whole, that problems follow because the essence of authoritarianism is righteous totalitarianism.<br /><br />The top dogs are a rather small group - a fraction of the total authoritarians - and they are described by social scientists as having \\"high dominance needs.\\"  \\"These are people who seize every opportunity to lead, and who enjoy having power over others,\\" John Dean, author of [[ASIN:B0013LTF2Y Conservatives Without Conscience]], and, more than that, they feel no remorse whatsoever about using others and breaking the rules to service their own agendas. This is clearly seen in this movie in the roles played by the cops in the \\"benevolent kidnapping\\" of the baby.<br /><br />The followers are something else altogether - and they complement the tog dog types completely.  These are people who accept the rules of \\"established authorities\\" pretty much without question.  We see this aspect of Kenzie in his dogged determination to follow the rules no matter how many people it will destroy, including the child. Such people usually are brainwashed by religion very early and this gives them a deeply rooted conviction that \\"higher authorities\\" not only know best, but are \\"unassailably correct.\\"<br /><br />Such individuals will also aggressively support their chosen authority.  They do not hesitate to inflict pain, suffering, even destruction, on others they see threatening the \\"legitimate authority.\\"<br /><br />Authoritarian followers also have very conventional, black and white, views of reality. They restrict themselves very closely to the rules that are laid out for them in whatever milieu they are born.  They don't stray from their own kind, theirown communities, and believe that they were born in a certain \\"place\\" and must stay in it. This conformity can be extreme to the point that such individuals become insular with their own kind, feel hostile to outsiders and novel information and ideas, and completely uncritical of the authority in their lives as they were growing up.  They are able to juggle extreme cognitive disparity, accepting bizarre contradictions in thought, and are usually unable to see their own hypocrisy. They also generally feel that they are moral and righteous in all they do.<br /><br />Watching this movie, the various characters and how they interacted, reveals these characteristics and dynamics in blatant display.<br /><br />Now, read again what Patrick Kenzie said at the beginning of the movie and see the inner landscape of the authoritarian follower:<br /><br />\\"I always believed it was the things you don't choose that makes you who you are.

B00005JKL8|5.0|High octane action/war flick. Makes you proud of the Red, White & Blue and what it represents.   And it's also fun seeing the bad guys get their comeupponce. Surprised to discover this was the  director John Moore's maiden effort, because he handles the action sequences like a pro.    And Gene Hackman? What can you say about Mr. Hackman that hasn't been said before? Excellent.  As always. This artist is a treasure.
B000065R29|5.0|There are only three romance films I will view time and time again - Casablanca, Cinema Paradiso and In the Mood for Love.  To dismiss the third as simply a pointless art house film is, in my opinion, undeserved because I regard it as a prime example of cinematic art at its best and most accessible.  A reviewer has termed the appreciation of this film as \\"cult following,\\" and if that's the case, count me in as a cult member.<br /><br />The story opens with a married woman, Chan Su Li-zhen, moving into an apartment in overcrowded 1960s Hong Kong.  Moving in next door is a married writer, Chow Mo-wan.  Their respective spouses are absent most of the time, with Mr. Chan often away on business trips and Mrs. Chow often working late.  Not long after, through gossip and coincidence, Li-zhen and Mo-wan realize that their spouses are cheating on them.  Both deeply hurt, they attempt to piece together the circumstances behind the affair and in doing so, they themselves fall in love with one another.  They decide not to succumb to what their spouses have done, instead choosing to internalize whatever desire they feel for each other.  Unable or unwilling to resolve their moral quandary, they attempt to go about their daily lives, tortured by the intensity of their feelings for one another, yet reluctant to do anything about it.  \\"In The Mood for Love\\" doesn't demonize adultery nor does it ennoble fidelity; the film takes no stance and it's up to the viewer to judge.<br /><br />It is to director Wong Kar-wai's credit that the reserve depicted by Li-zhen and Mo-wan sizzles hotter than any sex scene in movies.  In here, the most one will see is a brief holding of hands, a pained embrace, a subtle grazing of arms, an intimate laying of one's head on another's shoulder.  It is also to the actors' credit that they are able to suffuse the screen with varying degrees of passion and longing simply by the looks they give one another and the slow movement of their heads.  It is all so restrained, so understated, and yet so sensual.<br /><br />Its two handsome leads, Maggie Cheung Man-yuk and Tony Leung Chiu-wai, of course, add to the film's beauty, and with Kar-wai's cinematic skills the total package is drop dead gorgeous.  Kar-wai heightens the claustrophobia of Hong Kong with tight, voyeuristic shots of narrow hallways, narrow stairs to a crowded noodle shop, and shots of apartment dwellers huddled over mahjong in a tiny room.  A graduate of graphic design, Kar-wai has an unerring eye for aesthetics--many slow motion scenes of Cheung swaying in cheongsams that are explosions of color in dark and smoky backgrounds, the jadeite on a restaurant table that evokes a past era, each scene seemingly a tableau meant as a feast for the eyes and a chance to share its characters' sadness.  Even the film's music emphasizes its mood and sensuality - from Shigeru Umebayashi's haunting instrumental to Nat King Cole's rendition of the Cuban romantic ballad, `Quizas, Quizas, Quizas (Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps),' to the original Spanish version of `Green Eyes,' `Aquellos Ojos Verdes.'<br /><br />In one of the last scenes, Mo-wan travels to Angkor Wat in Phnom Penh, where he whispers in a hole in a tree what we guess to be his longing for Li-zhen for we don't hear what he whispers.  He then covers the hole with mud so the secret will forever stay buried.  Among all the brilliant scenes in this film, this is the one that haunts me the most.  \\"In the Mood for Love\\" is highly stylized and lush, and watching it is an intoxicating and hypnotic experience, but more importantly, it's a sensitive and thought-provoking film that will resonate to those who've loved and desired someone they cannot have.  I can only wish more movies were made with this level of artistry.<br /><br />(Language: Cantonese with English subtitles)nderstated, and yet so sensual.

B0000683DH|5.0|I'm not a Trekkie or a Trekker.      My interest in things Star Trek is take it or leave it.  There's been tons of schlock in the original series, the spin-offs, and the movies.    Wrath of Khan is the best of the Star trek movies because like the best of the series, it focuses on the relationships between the principals.      The script is really quite moving, dealing with Kirk's aging, encountering a son he hasn't had any relationship with, and that son's mother.  And we have Spock's death, one of the best death scenes in cinema.      We're supplied with a credible bad guy, Ricardo Montalban, chewing scenery, quoting Milton (all the while in an unfortunate mullet, I'm afraid).      And we have Kirsty Alley, stealing scenes in a very early role, as Spock's Vulcan protege.      Everyone is chasing after an interesting mcguffin, the Genesis device, which brings dead planets to life.    The backstory was that after the bloated mess of the first Star Trek movie, with its cost overruns and generally middling reviews, this was planned as a TV movie, possibly as a relaunch of the TV series.      By the time they were in post-production, they wisely realized that the movie would probably do okay in theatres.  So this movie was made on a TV-movie budget (the tiniest of any Trek film by far), and made tons of bucks.      The special effects are mostly okay; penny-elegant and effective but not over the top.  The nebula is very pretty; later Trek series would reuse the shots endlessly.      Quite fun all around.
0061438294|1.0|This book was so basic and did not have enough pictures... it's a body language book for crying out loud!  If you want to invest in learning more about non-verbal communication buy \\"The Definitive Guide to Body Language\\" by Alan Pease - that book is the best book on the topic that I have seen to date!  Don't waiste your money on arrogant Navarro's book!  TERRIBLE!
6305127638|4.0|Enjoyable, action-filled, but if you haven't watched the series, you might be a bit at sea.    So let's see: um, Picard once got bitten by a cyborg race called the Borg and developed Space Lime Disease, and oh yeah, Warf is on that spin-off show Deep Space Nine, so that's why he's on that little ship (with nobody else from that show, apparently).  Oh, and there's this guy named Zephram Cochrane from the ORIGINAL series who created warp drive, and later became immortal, sort of.      But if you can chew through that or ignore it, there's the nasty Borg queen, played by Alice Krige with scene-stealing glee, nifty space battles, fun with the holodeck, mercy killing, and the always effective Alfre Woodard.  And don't forget James Cromwell, just a few years after that little piggy movie got him a much better agent.      Jonathan Frakes, (Commander Riker) directed, quite capably.  The film  moves along at a nice pace, rarely stalling (usually only when Patrick Stewart is having a \\"SERIOUS ACTING!\\" moment).  There's the story on the ship, battling the Borg, and the story on the planet, where half the crew is trying to get the reluctant Cochrane up in the air in his rickety warp ship, on schedule.  Balancing the two stories is really quite a feat.    Compare the editing and cutting between the two stories with Lucas's dismal Episode One: I would have gladly killed little Anikin, Jar-jar, Amidala and her bully-boys myself just so we could get back to the climactic light saber duel.    This Trek movie is enjoyable, but if the second paragraph above make you go \\"huh?\\", better get a trekkie on the couch to ask questions when you watch this.
0316010669|3.0|Forgive my poor English. I would like to quote a passage on \\"Competing on analytics by Davenport and Harris\\" which wrote what I failed to express. Enjoy!<br /><br />\\"It's ironic that a book praising intuition would arise and become popular just when many organisations are relying heavily on analytics, but then perhaps that's part of its romantic appeal. It is fun and persuasive, but it doesnt make clear that intuition is only appropriate under what circumstances. The author is undoubtedly correct, for example, that human beings evolved a capability to make accurate and quick decisions about each other's personality and intentions, and it's rare for formal analysis to do that as well. Yet even the author argues that intuitions is a good guide to action only when it's backed by many years of expertise. Any many of the author's examples of intuition are only possible because of years of analytical research in the background, such as Dr. John Gottsman's rapid and seemingly intutitive judgements of whether a married couple he observes will stay together. He's only able to make such assessment because he observed and statistically analyzed thousands of hours of videotaped intactions by couples. It's also clear that decision makers have to use intuition when they have no data and must make a very rapid decision - as in the author's example of police officers deciding whether to shot a suspect.\\" pg13-14
B0013FDM7E|5.0|This intense Sci-Fi/horror is what I call 'smart' sci-fi because it gets us emotionally attached to the characters 'before' anything shows up to attack or eat them, that way we really care if something happens. I recently saw a movie (won't mention the name) where the characters were so annoying I was cheering for the monster. I Am Legend is a high caliber movie in its genre and I've always thought Will Smith gives one hundred percent to all the roles he plays. This tale is a cautionary warning of how we humans can really mess up. A virus developed as a hopeful cure to cancer becomes a deadly infection that turns humans into hideous beings that hover in the dark, unable to live in the sunlight. Very few people are immune to it and the city of New York is closed off. Will Smith plays a doctor who dedicates the remainder of his life to try and find a cure, lonely and left only with his dog, our hearts ache for him. I must say the creatures were truly creepy.  They didn't go overboard on the effects, it's the subtle approach that makes them extremely horrid and too realistic looking. I always crave the truly happy ending, but what can I say, this film met me half-way in that area. Maybe some of us need to get over our happy ending cravings.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay -  Author
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Taken as an animated film without any literary basis, this DVD is fine.  Otherwise, it's a cheapened version of the original story.  The Director wanted it to be a Beowulf anyone could enjoy or understand.  He could have done that without resorting to a lame \\"Sins of the Father's\\" theme.  I guess if you were an early student of Frederick Crews or a devoted Freudian, the story may have seemed clever or \\"true.\\"  I think the Director and writers should give the audience a little more intellectual credit.  The effort to make Beowulf more of an everyman instead of the archetypal hero robs the story, and the character, of its power.  Instead of an inspiring story and character Beowulf is made into an average story about a petty tyrant.  Attempts are made to disguise the shallow nature of the film through visual effects, starpower, and sexually suggestive scenes.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie already has many excellent five-star reviews that explain the story and characters, but I feel it is necessary to address some of the doubts that I had going into the movie. This film is slightly similar in concept to \\"The Princess Bride.\\" (a classic and another movie I adore) I'm not saying that they are by any means the same style of narrative. After all, Princess Bride was intentionally flavored by both the teller (Peter Faulk's grandpa character) and the imagination of the young Fred Savage's little boy. This tale is not framed as a work of fiction and does not share the \\"novel\\" (pardon the pun) aspects of \\"The Princess Bride\\" such as the R.O.U.S. and the six-fingered man.<br /><br />Rather, \\"Stardust\\" is a tale we are supposed to believe is true. The story is interesting in that it shares some things from high fantasy (such as unicorns) but it has the overall setting and feeling of a folk tale. In fact, Gaiman's excellent plot seems extremely reminiscent of a Brother's Grimm tale, complete with violence and a moral. However, don't let this fool you into thinking this story is dark and gritty. Gaiman's most interesting trait as a writer, in my opinion, is his ability to create the threat of real danger and even (albeit rarely) death for his characters without using shock or gore. Never do you feel that anyone is given a free pass to live \\"happily ever after.\\"<br /><br />I popped the DVD in the player expecting a tongue-in-cheek, perhaps self-referential comedy/fantasy piece, but what I watched was really a well-crafted, satisfying, and original tale. Great casting combined with excellent dialogue made me completely forget myself in the movie. This isn't the second coming of \\"The Princess Bride\\" like I thought it would be. It certainly isn't better, but, amazingly, it isn't worse. It's a new experience, but if dig swords, sorcery, and a compelling narative then \\"Stardust\\" is for you.
B000K1P66W|5.0|THE FOUR AGREEMENTS is printed in an easy to read style, but has a powerful message when applied. The foundation of the book is based on Toltec wisdom, and the ancient spiritual knowledge passed down through the cultural \\"masters\\" called naguals(shaman). Ruiz underwent an event that changed his life's path from surgeon to nagual. Often times ancient wisdom is not so ancient when it still can be applied to modern living. What the book offers is timeless. It is about grabbing hold of a personal freedom that was always yours and using it to master your life and not allow others to master you.  This is solid knowledge that can only add clarity to your everyday living.<br /><br />If you follow and apply THE FOUR AGREEMENTS,which are \\"Be Impeccable with Your Word\\",\\"Don't Take Anything Personally\\",\\"Don't Make Assumptions\\", and \\"Always Do Your Best\\", you will find a security within yourself that provides you with a better perception of yourself and the world around you. We as people, and as individuals,are \\"conditioned\\" by our society. This book will help you to break away from that conditioning and most of the responses and reactions we assume as normal. It gets you to think in a different manner that builds stronger emotional resilience.<br /><br />Although this book is based on spiritual wisdom,it offers opportunities  not only in spiritual growth,but also personal relationships,personal growth,enhanced awareness and perceptions,better decision making,and builds emotional strength.  THE FOUR AGREEMENTS easily falls in with those who would simply want to improve their everyday choices or decision making skills as applied to the workforce or business management.<br /><br />Not quite sure if you are being taking advantage of,being made the victim,making the right choice,over reacting,being to sensitive,or tired of not meeting someone else's expectations, then this book is for you.  I have given this book as gifts to several acquaintances over the years who have found themselves in life changing events that had left their emotions in turmoil and essentially could not be relied upon for a good decision. By reading this book and writing THE FOUR AGREEMENTS on a business card placed in their pocket,when a questionable decision or choice had to be made,they went down the list and used it as a guide to measure against to ensure a better choice or decision knowing they could not rely entirely on their own ability to make a sound judgment under the emotional strain they were feeling. Using THE FOUR AGREEMENTS as a personal tool added clarity to a seemingly murky emotional state, something I believe we have all experienced at one time or another.<br /><br />I have not read any of the other books written by Ruiz,but have glanced through them at bookstores. I only found a personal connection with this publication and can only endorse this writing. This book is a great companion to the book AWARENESS by Anthony deMello and compliment each other well.events that had left their emotions in turmoil and essentially could not be relied upon for a good decision.

B00004Y6OA|4.0|After the somewhat lackluster \\"II\\" album Van Halen made a nice comeback with this one.  In fact I think this is one of the band's best discs.  Things get started with the heavy rocking \\"And The Cradle will Rock...\\" and \\"Everybody Want's Some\\" both big hits and great songs.  I am not a huge fan of the next track \\"Fools\\", but after that \\"Romeo Delight\\", the short Sabbath like instrumental \\"Tora Tora\\", \\"Loss Of Control\\" and the bluesy acoustic \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\" are all great tunes.  \\"Could It Be Magic\\" and \\"In A Simple Rhyme\\" close out the album and are both good tunes as well.  By today's standards this album would only be an EP at a little over 30 minutes, but at least it is all original material with no covers.  This is one of the band's best discs and essential for fans.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Madonna has lost her magic, Hardy Candy is her most uninspired album to date. It seems as if she was just making an album for making an album. She hooks up with JT  and all the biggest Hip Hop stars to win the U.S market, making something marketable but dull.  1. \\"Candy Shop\\". 3/10.Embarrasing song. Is this how a 50 year old shows her sexual maturity, by chanting lyrics as a 16 year old skank. Older woman can be sexy, specially when they transmit their maturity, think Kylie's \\"x\\", Goldfrapp \\" Supernatural\\", Bjork \\" Vesperstine, 3 albums about sex that are smart and original. What ever happend to the woman who made \\"Erotica\\"? Talking about sex albums.  2.  \\"4 Minutes\\". 5/10.Madonna pimping JT. Gross. Madonna should be singing with Prince or even Kylie, someone equally great as her. Using the most popular youngster and producer of the moment, is an easy trick for a woman known for her innovative choices, think William Orbit or Mirwaiz.  3. \\"Give It To Me\\". 7/10. Although a little bit over produced, this is the only song that gets closer to Madonna's usual goodness. The \\"get stupid\\" part is a little bit painfull, plus Gwen Stefani did this kind of stuff.  4, \\"Heartbeat\\" 2/10. Terrible and unispired lyrics. \\"See my booty get down\\" Madonna chants. Great!  5. \\"Miles Away\\" 6/10.  Similar to ballads such as \\"I Deserve It\\" or \\"Love Profusion\\", although the mediocre lyrics and monotonous production make it sink.  6. \\"She is not me\\" 3/10.  Bad Lyrics, cheesy production. \\"She is not me, She doesn't have my name\\" , Duh.  7. \\"Incredidle\\" 4/10. \\" Just one of those things,When everything goes incredible, and all is beautiful\\" she sings. Is Rocco writing her lyrics?  8. \\" Beat Goes On\\" 5/10. Although unoriginal, its almost decent. The Kenya West cameo kind of kills it. Again Madonna trying too hard.  9. \\"Dance 2night\\" 5/10. Almost good. I kind of like the \\"You don't have to be rich and famous to be good\\"  part but the rest is just moronic sexual inuendo between Madge and JT.  10. \\"Spanish Lesson\\". 1/10. We all know this sucks.  11. \\"Devil....\\" 2/10. So overproduced it almost explodes and not in a good way.  12. \\"Voices\\" 2/10. This sort of sounds like Michael Jackson \\" Dangerous\\" album, but in all the wrong places. This 90's retro song has almost acceptable lyrics but its so overstuffed that it becomes unlistenable.  If you are looking a good pop album for the summer go and get Kylie \\"X\\" or Robyn \\" Robyn\\". This album is utter crap, I wonder if Madonna even likes this?. I really hope Madonna redeems herself, her next album better be good.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|\\"Fair Warning\\" is kind of the black sheep album in the Van Halen catalogue.  Other than \\"Unchained\\" the album did not receive a lot of airplay (at least compared to the band's other Roth era discs) and is probably the least commercial of their late 70's early 80's works.  The band took some chances on this one which for me is a good thing.  This is also probably the least party / fun oriented album of the Roth years.  There was tension within the band by this point and it shows.  There are no acoustic guitars to be found here either as the majority of the album is hard and heavy.  The first use of keyboards by Eddie can be found here on \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park\\".  These would become more and more a part of the Van Halen sound on later albums.  The album really starts out strong with \\"Mean Streets\\", \\"Dirty Movies\\", \\"Sinners Swing\\", \\"Unchained\\" and \\"Hear About It Later\\" all solid tunes.  The second half of the album is not quite as good, but still decent.  I would probably rate this one as my 3rd favorite of the Roth years.  Although it did not spawn a lot of hits and was a commercial disappointment this one is well worth owning for fans of the band.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|This is of the double Kino DVD. There are a few improvements in this edition, making it worth getting, particularly as you can find it reasonably priced. First the improvement of the frames per second makes the acting more realistic and modern if still more than touched by Wagnerian over-emoting. Note: there are tiny frame displacements that in this digital computer age could easily be fixed by fabricating the tiny image loss between the two surrounding frames and it is hoped in the future Kino, Criterion and other labels will stop being reticent to do this. Creating the missing frames in such things as Harpo Marx's run across a couch with an ice block in one of their Paramount comedies will benefit from this too. It's no different than removing noise from the soundtrack or dirt from the print.     The images are almost pristine, and the tinting lovely. There are a few sequences that should be tinted and either Murnau neglected to do them or the surviving materials are missing them - for instance Orloc crosses to his house in full daylight carrying his coffin of dirt. Obviously Orloc dies in the morning sunlight later, so this sequence should be tinted blue for night. It would be no crime to fix this. Ditto when Orloc dies, there is no tinting as the sun hits him, yet when the film cuts back to the dying woman the room is tinted gold. It seems obvious this is some kind of technical oversight at the time. Preserving such an error isn't film scholarship, it's stuffy academy-itis, like the insistence that Shakespeare's son's name was Hamnet (not Hamlet) though it's certainly just poor penmanship by the local Stratford official.     The music is by far the best of the many film soundtracks over the years, most of which are too clever, too modern, or contemptuous of the original film, treating it as camp. This is just right, a reconstruction of the original classical score, deeply romantic and gothic, Wagner Lite. \\"Nosferatu\\" is a love story, in fact two love stories that intersect tragically. This score completely expresses that. The complaints about it are inexplicable to me. If you want a jagged atonal score, buy Kino's previous issue. This version is what Murnau obviously intended musically.     Murnau and Gance and Cocteau are the great surreal artists of the cinema, and no one has touched them via modern computer work to date; Tim Burton should study Murnau for a couple of years before he tries to make another film, his \\"Sweeney Todd\\" was childish compared to this. Given the technical limitations he had to deal with of the period, Murnau may have been the greatest of all, though Gance was more innovative. This is the edition for anyone who hasn't seen this film before, or anyone who has seen it many times and loves it. There will be a better issue in some decade to come, but it will be built on this. The German disk is actually unnecessary, but probably allows Kino to pay for the issue by charging for a double disk; given the results they are entitled.     PS If you want to dig deep enough, there are anti-Semitic and homophobic strains in the depiction of the title character - the anti-Semitic patina remarked upon when the 1922 actor's name was used for the villain in the Tim Burton Batman film - but frankly there are very few horror films then or now that don't in some way. It's certainly less homophobic than \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".
B00008RV1L|4.0|I had never seen this movie before now and I must say it took me completely by surprise. Bale gives another winning performance in this dark satire about 80's yuppie life. The film is totally engrossing in the first three quarters, but does seem like a bit of a let down in the end. For that reason I give it a 4 star rating. You'll either love it or hate it.
B000MZHW40|4.0|To start off let me go ahead and say that Blood Diamond is a excellent film and a must-see.  The setting is 1999 Sierra Leone, at that time ravaged by civil war.  Danny Archer (Dicaprio), a ex-mercenary turned diamond smuggler joins forces with Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) to recover a rare pink diamond, and to rescue Vandy's son, who has been forced into being a child soldier under rebels.  This was all around a great movie, the best of 2006 if you ask me.  Its stellar cast also includes Jennifer Connelly as a journilist that tags on part of the way.  The movie is overall very powerful, well casted, directed, written, and filmed.  Be warned that it is not an action movie that is made to entertain, it was made to make a point, and it has a good message.  My only gripe is that the end is so predictable and unoriginal that it takes something away.  I felt that the bland ending did not fit the rest of the film.  Bottom line is if you liked \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" than you will like this.  ****1/2
0783230079|3.0|It's hard to believe I never heard of this movie before now. Although it was not quite what I expected, I found the cast gave it their all in this heartwarming and inspiring little supernatural comedy. Robert Downey Jr. in particular was very good showing his best comedic and serious layers. The DVD has a very good transfer, but not much else in the way of extra material.

B000YENUI6|5.0|I wasn't crazy about the last Cronenberg/Mortensen outing \\"A History of Violence\\" and wasn't sure what to expect here. Cronenberg has never really made a bad fim and I have a deep appreciation for his darkness, both in the characters of his films and the general lighting and design of his sets.  Viggo Mortensen is strong as driver/enforcer for a Russian crime family in London. He has suprisingly little meaningful dialogue and plays the part well by not overcompensating his badness and instead creating a tense aura with his self-confident and unrelenting facial expression. A man with no doubt, only a mission.  The plotline follows a young London nurse of Russian heritage and her investigation of the newborn child of a young and addicted prostitute who died shortly after giving birth. Her trail leads her to the Trans-Siberian restaurant, which is owned by Semyon, the head of a Russian crime family, Kirill- Semyons impulsive and violent son and Nikolai (Mortensen) a driver/enforcer who is rapidly gaining the fathers favor.    If there is any critcism to be had, it of the unidimensionality of the Kirill role, similar to the \\"climbing but dumb son\\" role seen in many other organized crime yarns. Great performances are turned in by all other principals and a good bit of the dialogue is in Russian with subtitles- a move that works in giving an honesty to the tale. Cronenberg always ends on a thought-provoking note, \\"Eastern Promises\\" is intense and hard hitting with the kind of script that we don't see often enough.
0393312836|5.0|Warning: This book is not for the faint of heart or the uptight. A Clockwork Orange is a very graphic and dark depiction of a sophisticated young man named Alex, who commits brutal acts of \\"ultraviolence\\" with his friends for pure aesthetic pleasure. However, it is also one of the most philosophically poignant books I've read, dealing with issues such as the nature of good and evil, the importance of free-will, and the inherent evils of government. This is definitely a must-read.    The most compelling aspect of the novel is Burgess' heavy use of a made-up teenage slang language called Nadsat (very appropriate commentary for our time, where today's teenage language of hip-hop vernacular and IM acronyms continues to puzzle adults). Although difficult to read at first, once you learn the Alex's language, you will become so absorbed in it that you may find yourself actually using Nadsat words without realizing it.    Also, if you have already seen Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange, do not pass over the book! It is much better in both style and meaning. At the very least (if you don't want to buy the book), stop by the bookstore and read the final chapter of the book, which Kubrick unfortunately decided to omit from his film. It fundamentally changes both the story and its message.
B0019J1JXI|5.0|this cd totally blew me out of the water. refreshingly new and daring. more mature artists should venture out of their comfort zone. all the tracks can stand on their own. radio will be a hard nut to crack. the charts will give way and let her in. foreign markets will be a great indicator and i can tell they will buy in large numbers. let's hope it lives beyond the first few weeks of excitement in this disposable sampling era we live in. all hail the queen is back looking great and still sounding every bit the awe-inspiring musician and performer she is.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|My friends all told me this $ucked but i saw it 4 myself and i liked it. The 1st person perspective throughout the whole movie makes it feel like you're there experiencing it all and that makes it all intense. If this was filmed through the usual 3rd person perspective, i think this movie would have blown. It runs at an exceptional rate and has some good jump scenes to get anyone to jump. All i can say, rent it first. i rented it and it was great but only rent it because it's only good the first time. and fyi: WATCH IT REALLY LOUD!  Trust me =)
0446577391|5.0|This is the 3rd book in a trilogy and it's very exciting and fun to read.    The Collectors and The Camel Club are the first two books in the series and I enjoyed them both very much.    David Baldacci is a good writer who moves the story along very ably.    He brings his characters to life and makes you care about them.
B0013J30XG|5.0|As a young child I remember coming home from school at the end of the day and laying on the carpet in front of the TV to watch Speed Racer. I loved Speed Racer as a child. However, when I saw the previews on TV for this live action movie, along with the colorful special effects, I thought, \\"Oh no. They RUINED my cartoon!\\" Well, I could not have been more wrong!! I have now seen this movie 4  times and I must say it is a masterpiece of movie making achievement. They got the cartoon absolutely right--essentially, this is a live action cartoon, but better! The story was great, the characters and their acting superb and spot-on true to the cartoon. Great job to everyone involved in this project! I look forward to purchasing this on DVD as soon as it is available!
006112429X|5.0|Shrivers darkly realistic tale looks into the life of a woman who's life has been torn apart by her son's massacre of seven students and a teacher.  As Eva's story unfolds we begin to see the dark side of motherhood and marriage both separate and intertwined that people don't really want to talk about.  What's central to the story is a number of issues most important probably being the myth of motherhood and the role Eva's and Kevin's personalities played in the tragedy that happened.  We know Kevin isn't a good person, but the question you have to ask yourself is what really caused Kevin to kill those people and was Eva's parenting to blame?  This book is a truly insightful look into the mothering instinct myth and the darker side of parenthood...definitely a must-read.
1594489505|5.0|Like \\"Kite Runner,\\" I just couldn't put it down. And, like \\"Kite Runner,\\" when I was reading it I thought it was the best story I'd ever read. It's right up there. There's something about Hosseini's writing style--on top of the incredible stories he tells--that is perfect without ever being obtrusive. He just pulls you in from the first page, and you're in another world. Can't wait for more.

B00015YVDG|5.0|The year Mel Gibson was born, Glenn Ford and Donna Reed had the roles of frantic parents dealing with the abduction of their son.<br /> The original 1956 film version of \\"Ransom\\" was of its time, complete with docile Bible quoting servants and a mother who, while periodically confrontational with those working on the case, remains upstairs and in bed under sedation for most of the time, and the kidnappers remain unseen.<br />  But this impressive 1996 remake is very much of its time, too, and as Tom and Kate Mullen (Mel Gibson and Renee Russo), an airline executive and a former High School Science teacher,we come to view a more complex couple, and we see how a shady business deal by someone who is supposed to be viewed as a \\"good guy\\" has led to the incident related in this story.<br /> As young Sean Mullen, Brawley Nolte is a typical nine-year-old with an independent spirit. Abducted while at a science fair over which his mother presides, he spends much of the film bound, and blindfolded with Heavy Metal music as the main sound he hears while lying on a mattress in a dark room, occasionally being pulled into a sitting position by his captors, and making only one attempt to fight back.<br /> In trying to retrieve her son, Renee Russo is more than just a mom who lies upstairs under sedation, but as might any modern woman in the same situation, takes a more active role in retrieving her son, even confronting the kidnapper and taking a few hard knocks along the way.<br />  Delroy Lindo's Lonnie Hawkins leads the team of FBI agents working on the case in the Mullen's apartment. He monitors Tom Mullen's confrontation with an incarcerated mobster named Jackie Brown(Dan Hedaya), a suspect in the kidnapping, and a botched attempt at a money drop before having to really steel himself to deal with Mullen's most dramatic act of sabotage: Going on network TV to announce that the $2 million ransom will now become a bounty on the kidnapper's head. From there, the drama escalates.<br /> Gary Sinese plays the devious Detective Jimmy Shaker, Lili Taylor is his conflicted lover, Maris Conner, who has a connection to the Mullens. Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg play Clark and Cubby Barnes, Evan Handler is Miles Roberts, and Iraida Polanco is the Mullens' not-so-docile housekeeper, Fatima, who lends a little assistance with the case.<br /> Under Ron Howard's skillful direction, the 1950s censorship codes are lifted and viewers are presented with an intense gritty, realistic, and ultimately satisfactory drama.

0452289963|5.0|This book was an inspiration.  Ever since I read this book I thought differently and MAN did that make a difference in my life.  It will in yours too.  He doesn't try to make you believe him, he is just telling you how it is and it is up to you to KNOW what he is saying is true.    Very uplifting and life changing.  This should be the manual for every person!
0156027321|5.0|Every so often, a book finds you, instead of the other way around, and this was very much the case when I came across \\"Life of Pi\\". It is a book that asks deeply philosophical and religious questions, while giving you a handful of answers that are subtle and mysterious.<br />In this fantasy-like (and very grown-up) story, our hero, Pi Patel, finds himself stranded on a boat, in the middle of the Pacific ocean, with only a Bengal Tiger to keep him company. For seven months, Pi remains a castaway, and his story is told by Martel with such gentle dignity and spirit, you can't help but feel a deep compassion and respect for this boy whose only companion at sea, is a possible man-killer.<br />The ending of \\"Life of Pi\\" is truly haunting. And like any good book that asks difficult questions regarding morality, and life and death situations, this book will leave you thinking - a spectacular read.<br /><br />Zara Stevens<br />[[ASIN:141967787X Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories]]

B000002L68|5.0|...\\"masterpiece\\".  All this album does is take me back to a place in time that is gone forever and that I wish so dearly that I could go back and relive again.  It was a happier time in my youth and a sample of what the music business was like in the late 80's and early 90's.  When will it ever be like that again?  If you haven't ever heard this album or seen the movie (where have you been the last 2-3 decades?), I'm envious of you.  The experience of the first time will never leave you, I promise you.
0553573403|5.0|I am not much for fantasy fiction, on the whole; I know it is hard to believe but I have never gotten into the LORD OF THE RINGS or HARRY POTTER but I absolutely loved A GAME OF THRONES.  I found it in one of those Amazon lists--if you liked this book, you'll love these--and the guy was right.  I can't even remember the other book's name but I am now into Book 2 of Martin's trilogy and I can't suggest Book 1 to you more highly.  It has a wonderful array of very interesting, odd and lovely characters.  They are all learning something as they have their facinating adventures.  And their adventures are marvelous--riviting and fun and amazing.  Martin has created a totally realized world and as he cuts back and forth between various recurring characters he moves us to the eventual denouement (hopefully in Book 3!).  I am much more into suspense, mystery and character stories and this is the first fantasy book I could not put down.  Excuse me--I have to get back to Book 2!
B000XA5K48|1.0|In all honesty you can waste your time reading some of the long winded reviews of others and still come out with less than what I'm about to tell you. This movie sucks! I'm a big time movie fan with a collection of about 500 dvds so don't take my warning lightly. This movie is in my opinion one of the worst movies that I have seen in literally decades. It has no saving graces, it's just plain bad.
B000002SE0|4.0|I picked this recording for several reasons:  [1] I saw Turandot performed at the Met with Birgit Nilsson about 45 years ago, [2] I could download the MP3 tracks and have it the same day.    I am very pleased with the overall recording, but the MP3 format is a drawback and I won't buy another full opera that is in that format again.  It is impossible (and we tried with editing software) to erase the pauses (however short) between tracks.  Some pauses are not very noticeable, but others are very noticeable and  a bit annoying.      If not for the pauses, it would be a 5 star rating.
0743289692|5.0|I was profoundly moved by this personal account of a life from childhood to civil war to living in a far off and strange land.  The pros are simple and direct and while the events are dramatic there is no sense of melodrama in this story of personal triumph over unimaginable odds.  Tribalism, religious extremism, subjugation of women, and brutality.  I would recommend this book to anyone in search of a better understanding of Islam and life in Africa with emphasis on Somalia and Kenya.  Above all, this is a work of courage.
0061537934|5.0|This book drew me in from the very first page.  That in itself is very rare in that most books takes a sort of \\"warming up\\" period at the beginning where you try to get over the hump of introductions to characters and other boring but important to know information.  This book however never really had a cold start in which one slowly begins to become immersed in the world of the characters, you just become involved from the very beginning and then it's mostly \\"warm\\", and on some occassions \\"hot\\", the whole way through.  Some people will LOVE it, and some people may only LIKE it, but no one will regret having read it.  It's definately in my top 20...maybe even top 10!
B000K7VHQE|4.0|A husband and wife embark on a road trip to California, hoping to enter their 7-year-old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.     The trouble begins when they are forced to take along their teenage son, who has taken a year-long vow of silence; druggie grandpa, who was recently kicked out of his retirement facility; and suicidal uncle (Steve Carell) who was just fired and jilted by his gay lover. They are, in essence, a group of individuals dealing with enormous personal problems, yet joined in their love for little Olive and their desire to see her perform in a competition that's the highlight of her short life.    Naturally, the trip is rife with problems from the moment the family hits the highway -- their ancient VW Bus starts breaking down in the middle of nowhere; Grandpa takes an overdose in a hotel room; and father Richard (Greg Kinnear) learns that the business deal he had quit his job in hopes of landing has bust.     To make matters worse, the lively Olive is hardly a stereotypical pageant contestant. Her honest little face is devoid of makeup, and her body still holding onto its baby pudge. Besides, what exactly is her routine? The fact that no one's bothered to preview it certainly can't bode well...    This hilarious independent film is bound to make all viewers laugh, as they see elements of dysfunction and drama common to all families.

B0010V4TZU|5.0|There is something intriguing and almost unnatural about the fact that I am continuously drawn towards Vampire Weekend. The light-hearted melodies with simple accompaniment of organ, harpsichord, strings, and flute, turn the clock back to the times of invincibility and carefree college days. Vampire Weekend is a four member New York City indie band, that slightly nods towards the afro-pop genre with a hint of ska. The 2/4 percussion, accented with African elements and an occasional conga, bring on that feeling of kwassa kwassa rhythms. Ezra Koenig, Rostam Batmanglij, Chris Tomson and Chris Baio describe their style as \\"Upper West Side Soweto\\", with influences from both, Western classical music and Congolese soukous music. After a couple of successful top hit singles on the UK Indie charts, Vampire Weekend got picked up by none other than XL Records. 2008 brought on their debut self titled full length, and by now it may be too late to hail praise to their sound - Spin has already declared them as The Year's Best New Band in March '08 issue. Look, it's been a while since I've written about anything other then instrumental or electronic, and even though I consider my taste pretty wide and open, Vampire Weekend reminds me that there's a whole ocean of untapped genres. Simply put, Vampire Weekend brings back the ease with which The Beatles conquered the world.
1932100660|3.0|In this book, T. Colin Campbell asserts that consumption of animal protein leads to heart disease and cancer, and suggests that going vegetarian can actually reverse heart disease and arrest the growth of cancer (and that old age need not be the ordeal that it usually is in America today).  He refers to the China Study, an extensive study of dietary patterns across various regions of China.  He claims that the study found that those who consume less animal protein get fewer \\"diseases of affluence\\" such as heart disease and cancer.<br /><br />The author also hypothesizes that consuming animal protein, including dairy products, can lead to autoimmune diseases, kidney stones (shudder!), diabetes, blindness, and other conditions.<br /><br />Campbell asserts that science in this country is strongly influenced by industries that sell food products containing animal protein, and also asserts that American medicine attempts to treat diseases with drugs and surgery rather than with better nutrition.<br /><br />However, there are many who question the findings in the book, and even most Eastern diets contain at least some meat.  While Americans as a whole do eat too much meat, and this book is a good warning to cut back on meat consumption to an extent, one might be wary about entirely eliminating it from your diet.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|Fracture looked compelling in the trailers, and with Anthony Hopkins - even more so.  Well, as it turns out, Fracture is neither a terribly gripping thriller nor a court room drama - it's somewhere in between and falls into the class of the above-average TV movie.  Hopkins is inscrutable as always, but unfortunately, we don't quite get the battle of wits that we did in Silence of the Lambs.  In this one, Ryan Gosling plays the male version of Foster's ingenue, but not as impressively.  The film opens well with gorgeous photography, but then slips into a tepid, scratch-your-head mode with Gosling trying his best to figure out the non-existence of clues.  Unfortunately, the audience feels similarly uninvolved and there isn't much of a subplot either, leading us to the ending where the chemistry between cat and mouse heats up but only momentarily.  Not an easy script, but a lot more mystery upfront and more scenes with Sir Anthony would've moved this along immensely.<br /><br />In short, for those expecting a dark psychological thriller, or a good courtroom flick - go check out Michael Clayton or Runaway Jury instead.
B000KI6286|5.0|I loved every bit of this movie! My expectations were quite low going into it but within the first 5 minutes, the movie won me over with its sharp humor, politically incorrect themes and great characters.    The writing was excellent, the acting was spot on and the characters are engaging and on target. I highly recommend this film.
0747593779|4.0|I got this as a birthday present, but managed to keep it for taking on holiday with me. It was one of the last books I read and finished it in a few hours, after reading the best part of it on the beach.<br /><br />I kept promising myself, just one more chapter, then I'll put it away, but with this book it's just impossible. It's not that any of the chapters finish on a cliffhanger, it's just you want to find out what happens to the characters.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns is set in Afghanistan, and although I was never an expert before, I wouldn't consider myself an expert now. I would however consider to be a little more informed about what has happened in Afghanistan over the past three decades. It centres around the lives of Mariam, Rasheed and Laila, as they grow old and struggle to survive. Any woman reading this book would be glad that they were not born in Afghanistan, as women are so repressed over there. The burkhas (a head to toe cover up, with only a mesh panel to see out of) sound absolutely hellish to wear, and I don't think I would put up with it. And I think any woman will be wanting to rebel against that and especially against Rasheed if they put themselves in Mariam's and Laila's positions.<br /><br />I defy anybody not to cry at this book. I finished it as soon as I got home from the beach and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a hard going book, as you gradually lose yourself in a different world, and when you come out of it, it's physically hard not to smack the next man you see across the head. You'll end up hating men after reading this, as they're the cause of the women's troubles in this. I'm just glad that I was not born in that country. I would simply have not survived - I would have gone the same way as the women in this book, but much sooner, and I would have paid the price for rebelling.<br /><br />Read it. It's a must.
817224164X|5.0|I've given \\"Mein Kampf\\" 5 stars based on its historical importance, not on its literary or organizational quality.  As a literary effort, the book is a disaster.  It is an absolute whirlwind of ideas, observations and prejudices.  Hitler repeats himself time and again and rarely follows an idea to its conclusion.  Hitler would have done well to have employed a first-class editor but, given his ego, this was not a possibility.  Perhaps it is even more remarkable that this thing became the Bible of the Third Reich and was actually given as a wedding present to all newly married German couples.  I have little doubt that some of Hitler's true believers must have recognized the book's defects but were afraid to make any real criticism.  This, in fact, is one of the real problems with leadership--dictatorships in particular.  The leader almost automatically is insulated by a thick layer of 'yes-men' afraid to speak the truth.  A fairly recent and egregious example of this was Sadam Hussein's inability to recognize that he was staring down the twin barrels of an American shotgun about to blow his head off.  His numerous syncophants were too terrified of Hussein's lethal anger to speak the truth.<br /><br />Even so, the book is of value to the insightful historian.  Hitler, in his own words, tells of the forces that shaped his belief system.  To be certain, he frequently lies, perhaps to himself as well as the reader but even lies can lead to the truth.  Antisemitism is not the main emphasis of this work but it's there.  He claims, disingenuously I'm sure, that he never even heard the word 'Jew' while living at home i.e. that his anti-Jewish opinions were the product of personal observations of Vienna Jews.  Then he turns around and cites the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' as proof of Jewish malignancy. He hints darkly that the 'Jews will get theirs' but doesn't elaborate.<br /><br />Much of 'Mein Kamp' is a bitter diatribe against the extinct Austria-Hungary.  His hatred--and Hitler has a lot of hatred--is partly because the A-H Empire sucked Germany into WWI but also because the Empire had become a polyglot of peoples [make that slavs] many of whom had positions in the Austro-Hungarian Parliament.  Young Hitler, starving in Vienna and with time on his hands, seems to have spent a significant amount of time observing the parliamentary wrangling which he likens to something like the cacophony at the Tower of Babel.  He describes how his observations pushed him towards anti-democratic beliefs.<br /><br />He makes a fairly insightful statement.  He writes that in parliamentary democracy there is no one to take real responsibility.  If things go right, everyone takes the credit.  If things go wrong everyone points to members of the opposite party.  How much better, he writes portentuously, that one man take responsibility, a person who is big enough to take both the credit and blame.  Of course, this is precisely what Hitler eventually did.<br /><br />He pats himself on the back many times.  He hates the Communists but not individual German Communists who he sees as men, much like himself, who are aimless, post war wanderers looking for solutions.  He cites a number of cases in which Communist goons enter his beer hall meetings in order to heckle and break things up.  He claims that these same goons walk away convinced Nazis.<br /><br />Is it true?  Maybe.  Communists appealed to 'true believers' as did the Nazis.  As Erich Hofer writes in his 'True Believer', it is not possible to convince a true believer but you can convert him.  Hitler was a powerful and charasmatic speaker and no doubt appealed to true believers--even Communists--seeking for answers.  I've even heard the testimonies of two Jewish men who were prevailed on to attend a Hitler speech.  Both testify as to the power of the event and how, before the speech was over, they too felt a need to 'do something about the Jews.'<br /><br />Hitler writes that one of Germany's greatest blunders in WWI was to fight a two front war.  Of course, Germany had little alternative because Russia and the Western Entente declared war on Germany almost simultaneously.  We, in reading Hitler's book have knowledge how he actually performed when he came into power.  Early on, most of his moves were fairly reasoned and were, of course, extremely lucky.  He was able to make a treaty with Soviet Russia and the West backed down time and again.  It started to come apart when he invaded Poland but again--and against the advice of his generals--he proved incredibly successful against the Poles and then the French.<br /><br />He was stymied by the English...but...if he had continued to exert full force against the English he might very well have proved successful in driving England out of the War.  He did something both remarkable and inexplicable.  He invaded his erstwhile partner, Soviet Russia--leaving the fighting English on his flank.  In doing so he directly contravened his own military advisors and, more particularly, his own advice in 'Mein Kampf'.  Why?<br /><br />For what it's worth, I'll offer several possibilities.  Following his own star, Hitler had proven ridiculously successful even in the face of detractors.  He may have believed that he was fated to achieve victory...no matter what.  Another explanation is that Hitler really didn't want to destroy England.  He reckoned that they were fellow Aryans and would sooner-or-later partner with him.  They were, in his opinion, neutralized by his occupation of Europe and U-boats.  On the other hand, this would have been a truly stupid conclusion.  The English had battled valiantly and showed every sign that they would fight on.<br /><br />My own suspicion is that Hitler, who was probably bipolar, was starting to feel the effects of his physician's daily amphetamine injections.  Hitler became, quite simulataneously, increasingly grandiose and paranoid.  He thought he could fly over tall buildings.  He couldn't miss.  Proof?  His subsequent personal and military behaviour.  Time and again he made increasingly stupid military decisions.  Some of the more remarkable were his orders to Rommel, defeated in North Africa, and von Paulus, surrounded at Stalingrad, not to retreat.  Rommel disobeyed orders and his army lived to fight another day.  Von Paulus followed orders and lost an army of 340,000 men.  Another is at Kursk, the largest battle in world history.  Hitler and his staff had evidence that the battle plan was compromised but went for it anyway and lost big.<br /><br />Another is the D-Day invasion.  Hitler's staffers, terrified of his towering anger, didn't wake him up to tell him the truth.  The Battle of the Bulge is another.  The war was all but over but he organized his scant reserves--forces that could have been better used to slow the advancing Russians--to try to force something like a major victory against the Western Allies.  Again Hitler only managed to hasten his end.<br /><br />Ronar.  Of course, Germany had little alternative because Russia and the Western Entente declared war on Germany almost simultaneously.

0385504209|2.0|I'm ashamed to say that I bought this book because of the international furor.  What are people thinking?  The writing is no better than average and the aspersions about the Templar's, Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail etc. etc. ad nauseum, are ridiculous.<br /><br />Yes, Mary is an important figure in early Christianity.  At one level, she WAS a disciple and may have been an apostle.  It is even conceivable that she and Jesus were married.  It is also conceivable that she was married to one of Jesus' other apostles.  There is no way to know.  Beyond that there is only wild, pointless speculation.<br /><br />This book is aimed at gullible fish and, judging from the hype, Brown hooked them all too eaily.  It is unfortunate that there are so many people who so badly want to believe nonsense.  I wonder who they'll be voting for this election cycle?<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of Mexican Conquest novels, \\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"
0143038583|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but there were also many parts of it that were dissapointing.  Pollan writes best when he writes as a journalist, telling us about his investigation of the role of corn in the American food supply, or about the varieties of organic farming.  But when he turns his attention to philosophizing about vegetarianism, the product is less than stellar.  And when he goes hunting with a mentor, his romanticization of it gets positively ridiculous.  This book is probably best as an introduction for someone who is just beginning to become interested in issues about food and the food supply.  Someone who has already given much thought to the subject may not get much out of it.

6300213749|3.0|Nick Nolte is Jack Cates, a worn-out cop who gets Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) out of prison for 48 hours to try to catch Reggie's old partner.    It's the classic misfit partners action/adventure story with a good dose of humor thrown in (it is Eddie Murphy, after all).    And actually, both actors do really well, and are very convincing in the roles. I completely buy Nolte's character as a cop who's seen it all and isn't very happy about it. And Murphy is classic Eddie Murphy--the Eddie Murphy from SNL, not the sanitized Eddie Murphy who makes children's movies. You know, the one whose standup routine broke records for the most frequent use of the word \\"f***.\\"    It's just that they seemed to be in two different movies--Nick Nolte in a serious action/adventure, and Eddie Murphy in a comedy. There wasn't any chemistry between them. And that might be just me, because I just read a bunch of reviews on the IMDB that said otherwise. I know I liked it enough back in 1982 to buy the video.

If you had to place it in a category,perhaps new country.The album had some fine ballads and soft tempo pop. Picture To Burn,Teardrops On My Guitar,The Outside,Stay Beautiful,Our Song and I'm Only Me When I'm With You highlight this well-crafted soft pop album.Young Taylor Swift has one of the better voices out there and am sure you will agree,if you pick this one up. Go get it and enjoy her fresh sound. A solid 4.5 for enjoyable soft pop...New Country if you will.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Paul Greengrass is back for his second go-round directing an installment of the \\"Bourne\\" franchise, and neither he nor Matt Damon disappoint in this action-packed flick.  For that matter, neither does anybody else in this polished number.    The movie opens with Bourne still bleeding after his horrific car chase through Moscow at the end of \\"The Bourne Supremacy.\\"  He escapes back into obscurity, but it seems only seconds until he's brought out of hiding by an enterprising journalist and a guilt-ridden CIA officer who is in charge of Blackbriar, which is a CIA program directly spinning off from Bourne's Treadstone project.  Bourne's name is mentioned as the root of Treadstone.    Soon, the CIA is hunting the journalist.  Under the direction of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (played with icy creepiness by the always-excellent David Straitharn), the CIA is playing for keeps - the journalist isn't being sought for questioning.  Bourne gets to show off a bunch of his tradecraft while protecting the journalist, but eventually he's on the run again. This time, he's got a couple of \\"allies\\" in the CIA in Pam Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles).  Parsons, in particular, gets to hint at a back story that explains why a star of Julia Stiles' caliber has been playing such a minor character.  (Mild spoiler - expect more from her in the fourth movie, already in production.)    In the Bourne movies, our hero has two choices - flee, or fight.  Since Bourne has a shoddy memory, he always chooses fight so he can get answers. This time, the questions lead him to the heart of who Jason Bourne is and how he became this lethal killing machine.  This is necessary, but not pleasant for Bourne.      While nobody is ever going to confuse the Bourne series with Great Cinema, it's about as good as action films get these days.  Nothing will stay with you very long after you leave the theater, and Bourne isn't an iconic hero in the vein of James Bond or Indiana Jones.  Perhaps it'sbecause Bourne is so humorless - he's certainly no Jack Sparrow.  But he's darn close to those guys, thanks to Damon's excellent acting and the intelligent writing that strings together the top-notch action pieces.  It's hard to imagine anyone else playing Bourne as well as Damon, and it's hard to imagine this series being any better than it is.
B00004Y87O|5.0|John Carpenter's \\"Escape From New York\\" movie was way ahead of it's time and is a much better script and story than \\"Escape From L.A.\\" In the second movie or it's continuum, there was too much repetitive dialogue copied or borrowed from the 1st movie. Snake is always left behind by one of his fellow thieves in both films and same dialogue of threats are made from United States Police Force commanding officers towards Plissken. They broke the mold with \\"E.F.N.Y.\\" film after it was released into theaters. Do they have a 'special featurettes' with the new dvd version of \\"Escape From New York\\"?
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|MASTERPIECE - HOPE FRIENDSHIP GOOD and EVIL<br /><br />I do not review movies but I felt like I had to for Shawshank. This is the best movie ever made. Outstanding story which have elements of hope friendship and love. If you are ever down watch this. By the end you will better.<br /><br />Director Darabont did this without almost any CGI that we come to expect from movies these days. He gives us this by giving strong characters and excellent story which is hard to come by these days.<br /><br />Newman's soudtrack goes hand in hand. Without it it could not have been a strong as it is.<br /><br />People will remember Shawshank 20 years from now but will not the ones that got the awards during its run. In my opinion Shawshank was not awarded by the Academy like it should have been.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|When Sarah McLachlan released \\"Surfacing\\" in 1997, it became a big hit, full of songs that are still on the airwaves more than a decade later. So when \\"Afterglow\\" came out in 2003, it was quickly scrutinized and compared to its predecessor. And while it has a different sound, the album is a lush, lyrical treat.    For the most part, \\"Afterglow\\" is full of ballads - songs that feature McLachlan's distinct vocals accompanied by piano and strings. But there is some fire here. 'Fallen' is a beautiful description of the mistakes we make in life, while 'World on Fire' shows vulnerability and uncertainty. And 'Stupid' is so brilliantly crafted that you will be humming it for days.    So what is it about this album that makes it so appealing? The descriptive lyrics, for one thing. In 'Drifting', for example, McLachlan sings, \\"Larger than life is your fiction in a universe made up of one.\\" The songs are near-poetry that rivets the heart and describes the complexities of pain, love, and life. And the string arrangements are soothing, mellowing out the record.     Overall, \\"Fallen\\" is an album worth checking out. Is it different than McLachlan's other work? Definitely. But different isn't necessarily bad. And in this case, it's hauntingly breathtaking.
0316143472|2.0|It is beginning to feel as if success is spoiling David Sedaris.  His writing is becoming, well, a little dull.  His rarefied  life in France and England has become a bit tiresome for the reader and his essays included here exemplify this disconnect.  I've read many of these already in The New Yorker, and was hoping this book would have some new and interesting work.  Very disappointing.
B00168ML1G|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest movies created. This movie is almost perfect. It has awesome action scenes, a great number of laughs, and parts that make you sad. Robert Downey Jr. plays his part perfectly in Iron Man. The only complaint i can think of is the ending battle, i believe it could have been longer and better. This is a must buy!!!!
0316743003|4.0|This book is based as an (auto)biography of Ben Rich the boss of the legendary Lockheed \\"Skunkworks\\". It is a lot more than that however with an overview of secret 'black-ops' of the cold war period. The development of the U2 and SR-71 as well as an in depth introduction to the F117 Stealth fighter make this a must have book for the technophile. But it is more than that, there are great snippets from 'other voices' such as engineers, pilots and even the military have their say about the Skunk works and in particular its enigmatic founder Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson.    This book does not have a lot of personal details about Ben Rich but concentrates on the three main aircraft that the Skunk works are famous for and allows an insight to military-private sector relationships that is hard to find in other books.    My only criticism is the end chapter on how to make things better for the industry which seems a little 'tacked on' to try and give the book a point and this could have been done throughout the previous chapters in a better constructed manner.    Apart from that it is a good book and due to the co-authorship of Leo Janos (who co-wrote the Chuck Yaeger autobiography) it is very readable and an interesting addition to military history of the cold war.

B00168ML1G|5.0|This movie is excellent. The actors were real, and were human about their roles. The change from being snooty Tony Stark to one of a superhero was flawless (unlike other superhero movies where you get a sudden change and their old personality was lost). The humor was great, the CGI felt so realistic (visually, you couldn't tell that it had CGI). The sound and music went great together. The actors didn't speak so quietly that you had to turn the volume way up. This movie is a must have.
0385484518|5.0|[[ASIN:0385484518 Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson]]<br />This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I read this as part of a college assignment.  It was one of the best assignments ever.  This book taught the class so much about living life, and living it to the fullest.  If you are facing difficult times in your life, this is a MUST READ.  Perhaps someone you know is facing family sickness, or having a difficult time with family relationships -- if so, this is a great book to help overcome those problems.  It will help you focus your energy into something more positive, therefore not wasting it.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0015519VS|5.0|The album is receiving bad reviews because of comparisons of Here I Stand and Confessions.     Here I Stand is a mix of songs that shows where Usher is at this moment in his life. Hence the title, \\"Here I Stand\\".      This album isn't for those who aren't solid RnB fans, nor is it for the crowd that turned to Usher for Confessions.  Here I Stand is a wonderful album and I recommend that the Grown and Sexy add it to their collection.    My Favorite Songs    1. His Mistakes   2. Love In This Club Part II   3. Love You Gently   4. Love In This Club   5. Moving Mountains  6. Trading Places  7. Appetite     Note: I got the album 2 days ago and I've listened to the above songs repeatly. I'm pretty sure the rest of the album is good as well, but these songs are the ones I felt in love with a first listen.
B0013FQX2K|3.0|This is Forster's magnum opus.  Its prose style and sensibility are utterly removed from ours, but its elegy for pastoral England still tugs on the heart.<br /><br />This version is cheap, but its line breaks are topsy turvy unless you set the Kindle to the smallest font (and even then it's still choppy.)<br /><br />I suppose you get what you pay for!
B0013FXWX8|5.0|Along with Shrek, Kung Fu Panda is Dreamworks best animated film to date by far. The voice talent is excellent, especially Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. These two not only have the best characters in the movie, but they have the perfect voices to make them stand out from all the rest. Ian McShane is also really great as the villian, but Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan are wasted. Seth Rogen has some good lines as Mantis, but Chan as Monkey gets only two lines of dialogue. What's the point of having someone as well known as him if he doesn't say more than a few words?<br /><br />The animation itself is in the same league as Pixar (especially in the digital theater I saw it in). The colors and textures will make you feel your really in ancient China. The character models and details are as good as any that have come before if not better. You know they did a good job when you actually care about an animated creature.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda is funny throughout without sacrificing the story, which is better than you may think. It seemed like the kids and adults were laughing on the same wavelength most of the time, which just shows you how well thought out the writing is. It works for everyone.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

B00051E906|4.0|I bought this device to use as the subject of a hiking project with my grandchildren, mapping with a GPS as I go and recording the local radioactivity as I go. (It should make a nice intellectual point to hiking.)  I first tried the device at my home (unradioactive I hoped) and then some other places that I knew, from previous use of laboratory-grade counters, definitely had some local radioactivity in the sand and cliffs and it gave readings more or less as I expected from the previous use of much more expensive counters. As another test, it also picked up radioactive gas-mantles quite well indeed when I sat the device upon one (the luminescent gas-mantles as often used in camper lamps are often very solidly radioactive--- a ref on this is available if amazon requests) The strong signal was expected but it was reassuring to get it. The device is convenient to use and I found gave repeatable results although you have to leave it sit for a few minutes to get a reliable result. Note that if you use gas old-style mantles to test it yourself please make sure they are the old-fashioned thorium based gas mantles as the many modern gas mantles are no longer radioactive. In my experience the non-radioactive mantles advertise this clearly on their packet and the old radioactive mantles are discreetly silent about radioactivity on their packet. (Choose one from an old camping shop that doesnt mention radioactivity on its packet and then dont sleep near it!)  The four stars come from its very low price for doing an adequate job.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|2004's \\"Finding Neverland\\" is a gentle dramatization of the playwright James Barrie's relationship with a widow and her four young sons, out of which will be born the timeless classic story of Peter Pan.  The movie successfully walks a challenging tightrope between comedy and tragedy, as childhood clashes with adult realities.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is pitch-perfect as James M. Barrie, a imaginative Scottish writer with a failed play and an unraveling marriage on his hands.  Walking his dog in a London Park, he encounters the four adventurous children of recently widowed Sylvia Llewlyn Davies (Kate Winslet).  His efforts to entertain the children are gratefully welcomed by an overstretched Sylvia.  Putting on fantasy games involving dancing bears, pirates and indians for the boys seems to recharge Barrie's own creative batteries.<br /><br />Barrie spends increasing time with Sylvia and the boys, in the process scandalizing the local gossips, pushing his already unhappy wife (Radha Mitchell) to the edge, and bringing down the wrath of Sylvia's suspicious mother (Julie Christie).  His theater producer (Dustin Hoffman in a comically crusty turn) is openly skeptical that Barrie's new play, about a boy who refuses to grow up, will attract an audience.  To complicate the situation, Barrie's efforts to bring off the play begin to collide with Sylvia's mysteriously deteriorating health.  The stage is set for a very dramatic and emotional opening night.<br /><br />In spite of the attractive fantasy elements of the story, this is a tough love movie.  Barrie, thrust into the role of de facto father, must teach the children the realities of the adult world without prematurely destroying their childhood.  Barrie and Sylvia walk a delicate line, balancing their shared concern for the children and their respective needs for emotional support, against the lack of any socially sanctioned basis for their relationship.  Barrie must also deal forthrightly with his failures in his own marriage.<br /><br />\\"Finding Neverland\\" is a small window into the theater world of 1903, where \\"Peter Pan\\" was a remarkably innovative production.  The rehearsals for the play provide comic relief, while its opening night brings together multiple plots threads.  \\"Finding Neverland\\" is very highly recommended as a entertaining movie, especially for those with their own childhood memories of Peter Pan.everland\\" is a small window into the theater world of 1903, where \\"Peter Pan\\" was a remarkably innovative production.

067960085X|4.0|Having never read anything by Capote, I decided to remedy that fault this summer. I read Breakfast at Tiffany's after In Cold Blood, and I was equally impressed with both. Unfortunately, I saw the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's before I read the book. While I liked both, they were quite different, and I preferred Capote's version. Holly Golightly is much more likable when portrayed by Capote because she's a deeper character.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite part of this book, however, was the short story \\"A Christmas Memory\\".  Though some could consider it sappy, I loved the way Capote wrote it. He reveals so much about the characters and the setting in subtle ways. He has beautifully captured the way friendship affects people's lives, even if that friendship is cut short.<br /><br />This collection is well worth the short amount of time it will take to read it. You won't be disappointed!

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|14 February 2015 Update: While editing this review to correct a spelling error and add the click option for other films mentioned, I was extremely pleased to discover that on 20 May 2014 the Blu-ray edition (\\"[[ASIN:B00IJE1C1K McLintock! - Authentic Collector's Edition [Blu-ray]]]\\") was released, but disappointed that I never got notified by Amazon about the release.  I immediately ordered a copy! That is how much I enjoy this movie.  Unfortunately, the reviews for the Blu-ray version are exactly the same as you would find for the multiple listings (different DVD releases).<br /><br />Please do not confuse consumer complaints, and their one star reviews about the quality of the DVD and or picture, with the QUALITY of this DVD version.  \\"[[ASIN:B000ANVPPQ McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)]]\\" is one of John Wayne's best movies, combining comedy--for which Wayne was not well recognized--and western genres.  \\"McClintock (The Family Authorized Edition)(VHS)\\" was the second John Wayne movie (\\"[[ASIN:6304457316 Stagecoach [VHS]]],\\" his finest, being the first) I showed my three sons as I introduced each of them to the wonder of the greatest film star of all time.  While I feel that \\"[[ASIN:B009YX8LO6 The Quiet Man (60th Anniversary Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]]\\" (additionally see: \\"[[ASIN:B00S89IAWU John Ford: Dreaming the Quiet Man (Documentary Feature) [Blu-ray]]]\\"), also with Maureen O'Hara, is the film Wayne should have won the Oscar for Best Actor, and rivals and parallels \\"[[ASIN:B000ANVPPQ McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)]],\\" the \\"[[ASIN:B009YX8LO6 The Quiet Man (60th Anniversary Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]]\\" is more for adults than the entire family.  I loved \\"[[ASIN:B000ANVPPQ McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)]]\\" when I saw it on the big screen in 1963, I was thrilled when it came out in VHS (although the quality was bad until John Wayne's family arranged for an official edition of the film to be released), and I am honored to own \\"[[ASIN:B000ANVPPQ McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)]]\\".  I just wish that AMAZON.COM would differentiate reviews for each version (Amazon has listed no less than ten versions of \\"McClintock\\" either by title or as part of a multiple film set--as of 2/14/2015] of a movie, as most of the bad reviews of movies are about the disk quality or some other aspect of the product, and not about the movie itself.  Hence, the overall reviewer rating for \\"[[ASIN:B000ANVPPQ McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)]]\\" is three stars [now closer to four stars--2/14/15), mostly, if not entirely, because previously released versions had major quality issues.  [And I want to emphasize that I fully agree that any problems--including bad quality--should be reported in reviews so potential buyers know about the problems.  However, reading a review that the quality of the \\"item\\" is bad, does not help me if I want to know which versions of the item are bad and which are not bad because all the reviews are combined; something that frustrates me to no end.  The same problem exists in terms of bonus features, as some versions have them but others do not; and assuming the Blu-ray version has them can be a huge mistake as I have personally experienced; although time has prevented me from writing reviews for some time now.--Updated: 14 February 2015]  But those bad reviews serve to inhibit people from buying the \\"McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)\\" version.  Granted, quality is an issue; but one that needs to be addressed to the studios, not the movie.  Thus, if I need a lift, I turn to \\"McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition),\\" because it has humor, sarcasm, and hope--not because the quality of the disk or features are less than desired.<br /><br />This delightfully wonderful film essentially spawned a new genre, western comedies, which ultimately lead to Lee Marvin's Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (\\"Cat Ballou\\").  \\"McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition)\\" also reunited JohnWayne with Maureen O'Hara, one of the few actors who could push Wayne to do his best work--in deed, I would include all of their (I believe eight) movies in the top 20 movies John Wayne made.  I would like to note that this was NOT their last movie together as stated in other reviews--\\"Big Jake\\" (1971) being one that comes to mind immediately.<br /><br />While Amazon's review pans the bonus features--again, something that has nothing to do with how great the film is--I found them quite entertaining and interesting.<br /><br />Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

0385340567|3.0|Jack Reacher passes through a Colorado company town, is hassled and he he hassles back. The book starts off ominously - suggesting that terrible things are going to happen to Reacher but that does not occur so the intro tone comes off like a disappointment by the end of the story. The book deals with various political topics from a left wing perspective (criticism of the Iraqi war, Christian end-times self-fulfilling prophesy, etc.) but unlike the bulk of the political left, genuine respect for the military is clearly present. Thus, Child comes off better than say Baldacci by appearing slightly more politically balanced. The pace is slower than some Reacher novels and Reacher's character does not change or grow in this novel so that generates boredom. Nonetheless, some newish topics are introduced into the popular fiction thriller genre so I came away from the book with a mixture of mild pleasure and mild-to-medium disappointment.     I recommend that you read it in paperback. It is not worth the price of hardcover unless you are a serious Lee Child fan that cannot wait.

B000EOTAM6|4.0|When I was first tantalized by the high-speed trailor for the 2005 Paramount motion picture, Aeon Flux, directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight), I was blissfully unaware of its history: that it was based on the darkly irreverant and raunchy 1995 MTV Liquid Television animated SF series created by Korean American animator, Peter Chung. The series achieved cult status among a select audience of imsoniacs (it played at midnight on MTV, if that tells you anything). This may have worked in my favour. I had no expectations or preconceptions, except for a hair-flying ride. As a result, when the content (written by Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay) had merit as social commentary, I counted it as a bonus.<br /><br />In typical dystopian fashion, we join the Aeon Flux story roughly four hundred years after an industrial-related virus has killed 99% of the world's population. Scientist, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) has developed a cure and the Goodchild dynasty secures a home for the five million survivors in the last city on Earth, Bregna, a paradise walled off from the unrestrained wilderness that ever-threatens them. Dystopias, like Bregna, often appear utopian on the surface, exhibiting a world free of poverty, hardship and conflict, but with some fatal flaw at their core. Built from scientific premise and intended only as a temporary measure, the technocratic society of Bregna continues long after its intended span as the Goodchilds attempt to deal with an internal and enduring glitch (infertility) of the \\"cure\\". Like most imposed provisional governments, this one's solution to a problem (cloning) has created yet another problem (fugitive memories from the previous clone's life).<br /><br />It is now 2415 and the walled society of Bregna appears utopian--clean and organized, beautiful, rich and spatious; but beneath the laughter and contentment, stirs an uneasy disquiet. Bregnans are losing sleep, having bad dreams, and are plagued by memories that don't belong to them. Rebels challenge the Goodchild regime, run by Trevor and his brother Oren, and among the rebels is a highly competent and ruthless assassin, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), whose tools include whistle-controlled ball-bearing bombs, drugs that allow her to meet people on higher planes of existence, and interchangeable eyeballs. She is aptly named, as she serves a true agent of discord to Goodchild, the guardian of order and all that he naïvely believes is good.<br /><br />\\"Some call Bregna the perfect society,\\" Aeon tells us in the opening scenes of the motion picture, \\"Some call it the height of human civilization...but others know better...We are haunted by sorrows we cannot name. People disappear and our government denies these crimes...But there are rebels who...fight for the disappeared. They call themselves the Monicans. I am one of them.\\" Several critics disliked the narrative introduction. I found that it particularly worked, by adding a reflective literary quality to the motion picture. It is noteworthy that in the original animated series, Trevor Goodchild often frames each episode with his reflections; only fitting that Aeon gets her chance in the film version. The reflective narrative of the motion picture is meant to enlighten its audience that this is not your ordinary action thriller. What follows is a fast-paced yet thoughtful story, with elements of romance, that explores notions of longevity, social structure and connection, faith and greed to a satisfying end.<br /><br />Twitchfilm.net aptly called the motion picture \\"biological science fiction\\". Says Oren, Trevor's treacherous brother who betrays him: \\"We've beaten death. We've beaten nature.\\" The film's clean organic high-tech look faithfully captures the \\"sense of biotech gone wild\\" of the TV series by exploring several paradigms inherent in a society that lives deliberately in the absense of nature's chaos. Indeed, the lack of connectivity resonates throughout the motion picture in its exploration of friendship, family, loyalty, and purpose. When her sister is murdered in the beginning of the film supposedly by Trevor's men (but in actuality by his scheming brother, Oren), Aeon's mission becomes personal: \\"I had a family once. I had a life; now all I have is a mission.\\"<br /><br />The film truly launches into stylish action and intrigue when Aeon gladly accepts a mission to assassinate Trevor, thinking that this violent act will make it all better. Instead, it unravels her, beginning with when she confronts him; finding him uncomfortably familiar and alluring, she hesitates and decides not to kill him. \\"What do you want?\\" Trevor asks her. \\"I want my sister back. I want to remember what it's like to be a person.\\" It is indeed he--or rather what he knows--that holds the key to who she is. The key is that she, like he and all those in Bregna, is a 400 year-old copy of someone before the virus. Four hundred years ago she was the original Trevor's wife.<br /><br />Filmed in Berlin, the movie is visually stunning, from the opening shot on the steps of Sans Souci to the labrinthine wind canal used by the Nazis. Displaying an eclectic mixture of spareness and mid-century design the film is acted out in a fluid dance to Graeme Revell's (Sin City) haunting score. The action is rivetting and seamless with both plot and underlying theme of bio-tech gone awry. Early on we are treated to a thrilling sequence of Aeon and her biotech-altered rebel colleague negotiating the security of Goodchild's sanctuary that consists of a beautiful but deadly garden, guarded by patches of knife-sharp blades of grass and poison dart-spitting fruit trees.<br /><br />Aeon champions moral ethics and single-handedly destroys the relicor, the supposetory of the clone DNA, pursuing honour at the expense of loyalty (to Goodchild) and heralding in a new age of \\"mortality\\". The movie ends as it begins, with Aeon's narrative: \\"Now we can move forward. To live once for real and then give way to people who might do it better...to live only once but with hope.\\" This is truly what Aeon Flux represents and what her very name embodies.nd purpose. When her sister is murdered in the beginning of the film supposedly by Trevor's men (but in actuality by his scheming brother, Oren), Aeon's mission becomes personal: \\"I had a family once. I had a life; now all I have is a mission.\\"     The film truly launches into stylish action and intrigue when Aeon gladly accepts a mission to assassinate Trevor, thinking that this violent act will make it all better.

Aeon champions moral ethics and single-handedly destroys the relicor, the supposetory of the clone DNA, pursuing honour at the expense of loyalty (to Goodchild) and heralding in a new age of \\"mortality\\". The movie ends as it begins, with Aeon's narrative: \\"Now we can move forward. To live once for real and then give way to people who might do it better...to live only once but withhope.\\" This is truly what Aeon Flux represents and what her very name embodies.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|...and this concert is no exception.  I saw this on HiDef satellite and it was stunning.  The video and audio are clear and have deep, spatial sound.  The guest appearances are a welcome bonus and prove that PF's music is without boundaries.  Highly recommended disc for fans of live shows and PF in general.  DG remains one of the best, if not overlooked, guitar players in our time and his focus and ability never fade - as readily apparent in the close ups and solo shots during this concert.  Get this DVD people, in today's 'flavor of the week' mentality, this type of contribution to musical art and level of available talent will soon not be so easy to see or hear...
0385340567|4.0|okay...so is this Lee Child's best? Of course not...but it's still way better than most writers in the genre. And as I've mentioned before, Lee Child never fails to entertain -- and whenever I can spend some quality time with Jack Reacher, life is just a little better.    As I've also said before, for those of you new to Mr. Child, I STRONGLY suggest beginning with his masterpiece, PERSUADER - as I continue to defy anyone to show me a book with a more exhilarating and staggering brilliant first chapter.    Thanks LC!
B000EULJLU|3.0|For such an innovative band this work was a bit of a dissapointment lyrically. Best recommnedation for a first listen would be their album Lateralus.  Recommendations off this album are Vicarious, Rosetta Stoned, and The Pot.
1741751772|5.0|This is an excellent book, a beautiful narration.  Kate Morton is a great storyteller!  Caroline Lee has the perfect voice for the narration.  One of the few books I truly did not want to end!     Go to Audible's website and listen to the sample of this book.  The characters are fascinating. You aren't really drawn in by a plot, but by the very human relating and foilables, such as we all have.     I'd say the main theme is how such little deceptions cause such major events in life. There is suspense about how it all happened and the flash back from old age is done remarkably well. The reader has such a colorful voice. The little characteristics of her words become very special in her telling of the story. I'd give more than 5 stars if I could!
B000VDDWDS|4.0|I will skip the review of the actual movie itself because if you are buying the blu ray version you have probably already seen this film.  What immediately hit me was the DTS master-HD soundtrack, this is why you buy new gear because the opening fight scene between lucky jack and the acheron is amazing the LFE makes your teeth rattle if you have even a decent sub.  Overall the picture quality is good but not that much better than on the standard DVD in some scenes but is is an upgrade over the DVD release.  The main reason to buy the blu ray edition(besides it being a fantastic movie overall)is for the sound design it is amazing, voices are clearly heard and you surrounds and sub will get one hell of a workout.
B0013LKZWS|2.0|I guess she's the current MTV darling. If you've never heard better I guess she's ok. Michelle Branch is much better, so is Natasha Bedingfield, and that's just listing who you'll find on MTV , which isn't saying much.  The songwring is adequate..the instruments are nothing great.  Her voice is nothing to write home about but she's about as good as Sheryl Crow..  \\"Love on the Rocks\\" is one tune I might play, the others rely too much  on lyrics and major label promotion.  I'd like to like this album for the lyrics but her voice and the arrangements underwhelm.
B000VL9XE2|5.0|it doesn't matther what anyone says this album rules no matther what dillinger escape plan rules.You say this is a new kind of dep but the only thing that's different is they are experimental now,you knew they changed since irony is a dead scene with mike patton because if you compare calculating infinity to irony is a dead scene,you will see some difference right? yeah it still had the heavy insane mathcore but it added some industrial or experimental and same with ire works and miss machine only it has more of it.So a different dep?yeah since irony is a dead scene but don't judge because ire works is still pretty heavy but miss machine heavier and more mathcore than this one so i recommend getting this one you'll love it,when you hear the song black bubblegum(that one is a new kind of dep)you might not like it at first but you'll find yourself rocking out on it.Greg to me is the best singer dillinger has had even if he sings many songs that are kind of slow,he sings the old songs pretty brutal better than the original singer and better than of course mike patton,really have you seen him live,he's out of control!So get the damn record it's still heavy this is future metal,well that's what they say SO GET IT!
B0013FXWX8|5.0|First, let me say, that a little Jack Black, for me, goes a long way.  When I heard that he was voicing Po, the main character of this movie, I wasn't sure if I could stomach the film, although the previews looked very good.  I'm glad to say that Black's performance is charming and sweet and this new animated offering from Dreamworks is a pleasant and welcomed addition to the summer box office.<br /><br />  The story revolves around Po the Panda, who works for his father in a noodle shop but dreams of the exploits of his martial arts idols, the Furious Five.  These five consist of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen) and Viper (Lucy Liu).  Atop a mountain overlooking the village is the Jade Pallace, where these warriors train, led by their master, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his master, a wise old turtle, Oogway.  By accident (or not by accident as the ancient turtle reminds them) Po is named the Dragon Warrior, much to the dismay of Shifu and his students.  However, once Tai Lung, a former student-turned villain, escapes from prison,  Shifu realizes he must learn to believe in the chubby, food-loving panda and train him for the fight ahead.  He knows that Tai Lung will stop at nothing to acquire the sacred Dragon scroll, believed to reveal great powers to the Dragon Warrior.<br /><br />  Dreamworks delivers with this animated tale, full of rich, beautiful color and sharp, eye-popping animation.  The characters are entertainig and Po is endearing and loveable, a hero everyone will want to root for.  Thankfully, this is a film that both the kiddies and the adults can enjoy.  As with their Shrek franchise, Dreamworks' Panda offers humor that appeals to all.  I look forward to this little gem's dvd release.  Highly recommended!
B00144VBBS|5.0|If you like Toby Keiths music you'll love this Cd with all his best and the new song that's climbing the charts sure to a big hit.
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|This is a great CD!! Slightly less \\"heavy\\" or \\"rock\\" than arctic monkeys and more \\"acoustic\\" to be sure.  Last 3 tracks are the best, but they are all good.  Check out some singles on youtube.com if you are unsure about buying.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|This album is a good album even though four of the songs I didn't like. Two were mediocre. Thankfully the remaining seven I liked or loved. Even though this was by far one of Rush's worst albums (as a complete work) it's still a must have for any true Rush fan. Even when Rush is bad, they still are better than most of the best work of most other industry-pushed cookie-cutter rock bands out there today.<br /><br />Alex and Geddy  - It's kick-a$$ to hear the guitars being brought back to the forefront. The electronic keyboards for which Rush was once criticized for, aren't even found. Alex's skill ranks him with among the great rock guitarists of all time. Geddy's vocals are seasoned and should be more agreeable to the average listener than it was throughout most of Rush's career.<br /><br />Neil has, since the early 1970's, been the main lyric writer for Rush. He's always been an open skeptic of government, and especially religion. After the death of Neil Peart's wife and only daughter in the late 90's, he rebuilt his life and moved to Los Angeles with his new wife (2003). It seems to me, that in recent years, in light of his moving to the United States in 2003 where he's certainly given a constant barrage of depressing news about the war in Iraq, American religious culture and government, the personal tragedy he endured - he's only become more jaded, cynical, bitter and skeptical of faith, religion, and ideals of an \\"inherently good universe\\". These views have become more obvious and recognizable in his lyrics.<br /><br />Below is my track-by-track review. Scaling: Tom Sawyer and YYZ (5 Arrows, 0 Snakes) - Arrows: good, Snakes: bad.<br /><br />Far Cry - Hard rocking, very retro. Great opener. Alex Lifeson's guitar work has a gritty, grunginess that reminds me of Rush's hard rock roots. Neil Peart's drums are heavy, complex, and inspired. Time has taken some of the shrilly edge off of Geddy Lee's vocals - which to this longtime Rush fan is fine by me. Musically this song is well done. Lyrically, while it has a catchy hook, it is quite the opposite of the lead track (One Little Victory) off their last album Vapor Trails. One Little Victory held a positive energy that Far Cry lacks. Even though Far Cry has hints of something positive - there is a stronger undercurrent of negative cynicism of the world around us. Five Arrows, One Snake (out of five).<br /><br />Armor and Sword - Melancholy but still beautiful. Certainly more subdued than Far Cry, it's power lies in it's lyrics. Lyrically - the song is very heavy, and like many of Peart's other writings, it's is both spiritual (in it's own way) and philosophical. However - this is by far the heaviest thing I've ever heard from Rush. Musically, Alex's guitar work is the best part of this particular song. It's somewhat strange, and it's aftertaste is none-too-pleasant. Four Arrows, Three Snakes.<br /><br />Working Them Angels - Bright and uplifting beginning. A welcome song for this album. The music for this album is rather average, but the lyrical storytelling is superb. Portraits of \\"factory towns\\" and \\"English winters\\" are vivid and provide a great contrast to the idea that a person can, by his own risky choices and behavior, \\"over-work\\" his own personal guardian angels. I was amused by the neat little reference to their album \\"Moving Pictures\\". Four Arrows, Zero Snakes.<br /><br />The Larger Bowl - Average and a real downer. Sure the song makes accurate and realistic observations about the world, and the song is kind of catchy (to me) - it's depressing tone is a bit much for me to take. After such classic songs as Subdivisions, Big Money, and Distant Early Warning - it seems as though Neil has lost some of his ability to call attention to the bad things in a manner that isn't a downer to listen to. Neil's drum work is great for this song, but it isn't impressive. Alex's stripped down guitar work is refreshing. Geddy Lee's instrumentation seems almost absent. Three Arrows, Four Snakes.<br /><br />Spindrift - Heavy spirited, wrought with tension. \\"Where are the words to answer when you talk that way\\" is a reference to the helplessness of meaningful dialogue with extreme fundamentalists who are not interested in dialogue but mere adherence to their faith. Ultimately, this song is about the clash between values of Western liberal tolerance and extreme religious intolerance. Musically it's not very inspired. Two Arrows, Zero Snakes.<br /><br />The Main Monkey Business - Awesome, intense, and inspired!  The first perfect song of this album. From the opening acoustical chords to the last note this is a magnificent instrumental soundscape sure to please anyone who has an ear for talent. Geddy, Alex and Neil all show that when Rush is firing on all cylinders, it is far greater than the sum of each of it's supremely talent parts. Though TMMB will never replace YYZ, this modern masterpiece alone is worth buying this album. So many subtle effects are used in the creation of this song - it's a wonder that only three men are playing this song. Five Arrows, Zero Snakes.<br /><br />The Way The Wind Blows - Bluesy, rocking, intense. Blues-based guitar work shows Alex and Geddy had fun on this jam-packed rocker. Geddy's vocals are very smooth in this song. Drum work shows Neil in groove. Despite another cynical and lyrical commentary on the negative aspects of those who are adherents to faith and belief - it's musicality is light enough to allow the listener to take the whole song in much easier than Armor and Sword or The Larger Bowl. While this one will never be radio friendly tune, it earned my liking for this longtime hard-core Rush fan. Four Arrows, Zero Snakes.<br /><br />Hope - Bluesy, guitar-oriented, and very beautiful. Coming in at just over two minutes, I wished this bright and wonderful piece would have been longer to balance out the otherwise dark and depressing cynicism found throughout just over half this album. To hear Alex Lifeson play that twelve string guitar is a pure privilege. Aptly named. Four Arrows, Zero Snakes.<br /><br />Faithless - Beautifully written. Both musically and lyrically. As a person who both harbors a Christian faith and is a longtime Rush fan, I've always had a difficulty reconciling my personal views and beliefs with the lyrical writings of Neil Peart. But after following Rush for twenty-plus years, I feel I have pretty good sense of who they are as a band and as people. And I've learned that I can still love and respect them for who and what they are. Lyrically speaking - this song is very Humanistic. As a Christian who has seen both the good and bad that \\"faith\\" has wrought on earth, I am very empathetic to Neil's skepticism. Four Arrows, Zero Snakes.<br /><br />Bravest Face - Semi-depressing with flashes of brightness. The strong opening gave me sense that this was going to be another rockin' tune. But nope, it didn't happen. Musically it seemed very mixed. At some points I felt like I could connect with it , but then a moment later, it'd lose me. I can't help but wonder if the producer's hands kind of over-worked this one. Geddy's vocals here soar without being pitchy or shrill. His bass-guitar work is inspired. Neil's drums are, again, excellent. But overall, I didn't quite know how to feel about this one. Three Arrows, Two Snakes.<br /><br />Good News First - Great drums, poignant lyrics. Geddy's vocals seemed ethereal on this one. Alex's guitar work here is some of his best. Lyrically, this song is somewhat of an attack on the religious right here in America, because many pay lip service to the \\"good news\\", and at times flippant or un-concerned with the pain of others who do not believe as they do.  Three Arrows, One Snake.<br /><br />Malignant Narcissism -  JUST like The Main Monkey Business - only better! Awesome, intense, and inspired!  The second and last perfect song of this album. Being a lover of bass-guitar, Geddy's abilities show that he's not just some high-pitched wailer who only plays an electronic 80's keyboard. Too bad this song is only 2:17 minutes long. Five Arrows, Zero Snakes.<br /><br />We Hold On - Uplifting end to an otherwise muddled outing. While it was tough to endure some of the darker songs on this album, this is a gem that you only fully appreciate when you've gone through the others before it. Musically it's well done, and lyrically it's contains a certain measure of hope that was mostly prevalent in Rush's last album Vapor Trails. Four Arrows, Zero Snakes.hless - Beautifully written.

0385341075|5.0|In the civil war torn island of Bougainville in the early 1990s where rebels face off soldiers from encroaching forces, there lived a native community long deserted by whites who had fled to the safety of Australia and New Zealand except for one with a native wife who chose to remain behind as a local school teacher, like flotsam from an earlier tide. His name was Mr Watts but in the eyes of the children took on the name and identity of Mr Pip, a character from Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\", which he read and taught to the children. Mr Watts or Mr Pip, as he was fatefully known, through his story telling brought hope to the community by creating another world, one which though imaginary became more real than the one they lived in. In the words of little Matilda, Dickens' characters were more real to her than the many dead ancestors she never knew. While Dickens was undisputably a godsend, Mr Pip's quiet agnosticism became a bone of contention for the god fearing Dolores, Matilda's mother, who was increasingly resentful of Mr Pip's secular thoughts and its influence over her daughter and the other students.     Poor Mr Pip - visually, you can almost see actor Peter O'Toole in the role if a film version were made of the story - didn't see the tragedy that would unfold when his imaginary name and identity became the trigger point for trouble that would shatter the lives of the entire community. It is a testimony to author Lloyd Jones's tremendous skill and confidence as a writer and his understanding of how less might be more in that unforgettable scene of horror and carnage told with the pitiless brevity of a passing news item. That truth and integrity should surmount differences in belief and uphold the essence of humanity is indeed cause for righteous tears and celebration. After experiencing such a dramatic high, the closing narrative cannot but feel slightly anti-climactic. But that's only inevitable.      Lloyd Jones' \\"Mister Pip\\" is a tremendous of pieceof work, warm, poignant and inspiring. It is possibly the strongest contender for last year's Booker prize. A book of enduring value that will be read beyond its current print run. Highly recommended.
B000I2J6K0|3.0|I am not in fantastic shape, but I am not new to exercise either. From the reviews, I was anxious to try this workout... but, in the end, it is just not for me. There is no fun or entertaining value to this workout, no jazzy or dancey moves. It's just Erin in her living room moving around. She is extremely well versed in prenatal fitness, and for people who just want to go through the motions and get it over with it will probably be an excellent workout. So, if you are looking for something fun and different... this workout is not for you. I've always needed a bit more motivation and dancing to keep me interested.
B0013FXWX8|5.0|This is the usual \\"loser makes good\\" plot as Po the pudgy Panda evolves from a lowly waiter in his father's noodle shop to the forecasted Dragon Warrior.  It is non-stop fun with enough quips and one liners to keep the attention of mom and dad.  I was there with my grand children and they loved it -- even the 17 year old thought it was worth seeing over \\"without all of the little kids\\".  I was especially impressed by the stunning art work and many scenes look like oriental paintings -- it is beautifully done.  I also was impressed by the fact that the movie just starts with little to no introduction.  This is clearly intended to immediately capture the interest of the small children  and I thought it did.  The credits are held until the end of the movie.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and a lot of fun.  If you are looking for a film to take your kids to this is an excellent choice.  Mom and dad will like this movie just as much as the kids.
B0015T7Q98|5.0|Disclaimers: I do not own their first album, and this is my first amazon review.    This album is really good.   I heard Nine in the Afternoon and bought the album on a whim.  I'm a big Beatles fan, and this album is a worthy successor.  It fades a little with the last few tracks, but all in all a good listen.  The creativity plus production is very solid.  I recommend picking it up.
B00005JLWN|5.0|At the dawn of the 21st century, society was faced with a great Third World War, and knowing that something had to be done to prevent further problems, humanity was faced with the dilemma of solving all of man's troublels.  As a result, they created a new enforcer of the law, the Grammaton Clerics, a collection of warriors who practice gun kata to improve their lethality while executing their sole task of eradicating any instance of feeling within humanity.<br /><br />To control the general public, daily dosage of Prozium are self-administered, similar to the daily dosages of Soma in Brave New World, except this opiate of the masses elimites melancholy, rage, hate, and jealousy, as well as the suppressing positive feelings of pathos, joy, and love.  Similarly, destruction of all that creates feeling, literature, art, all that gives us emotion, just like the firemen in Fahrenheit 451.  Large-scale indoctrination is accomplished through the visualized, Apple commerical-esque, Big Brother screens of 1984 (used later in V for Vendetta).  The combination of the three classic dystopian tales is flawless, each blending into the other, and the collective producing realism and fear for what could easily be a not-so-distant future.<br /><br />Two Grammaton Clerics, John Preston (Christian Bale) and Errol Partridge (Sean Bean), have worked together to \\"protect\\" society.  However, Errol has been confiscating sense offender material.  Eventually, John catches Errol because he had been sneaking outside of the city to commit sense crimes.  When he is eventually uncovered face-to-face, John must bring his partner in for justice.  His partner would rather die than be captured or give up feeling, and in a final act of defiance he quotes a passage from his book and raises his book to cover his eyes.<br /><br />Partridge's final words would later haunt John in a dream, as they serve as the catalyst for his finaly memory of his wife, the moment of her sense crime incarceration and eventual incineration, and he remembers with horror his still, emotionless inaction.<br /><br />The following morning John drops his dosage of Prozium.  His sone recommends a trip to Equilibrium for a replacement dosage.  Only, John doesn't go, and he begins to feel, to sense and perceive all the wonderful feelings previously unknown.  Soon, he enjoys the touch of an intricately designed vase, cries at the sound of Beethoven, and risks everything by protecting a puppy from extermination.<br /><br />The gun battles are equisitely designed and choreographed, a little Matrix crossed with a little Jet Li action.  Christian Bale delivers an impressive performance as a man who is initially wooden, and later severely troubled by his actions.<br /><br />Eventually John must face the battle between his logic and his emotions, his allegiance and his freedom, as he comes to terms with what he has done, what he has become, and what he wishes for the future.remembers with horror his still, emotionless inaction.

B000002JPA|5.0|In my collection of 400+ CD's comprising various forms of metal, goth, shoegazer, swing, choral, opera, broadway, and others, this still stands as one of my five favorites.  It's inspired, creative, and novel.      While the time since its release have led to newer sounding keyboard technology, the keyboards sounds here are still very passable, nothing like changes since the old 70's era Yes or Emerson, Lake, and Palmer keyboard sounds.      Of several progressive metal and progressive rock selections I played this for an opera fan last week and he found this the most inspired, creative, and pleasing.  With respect to what is current in the metal scene, it feels that way to me too.
B0014I4KIK|3.0|Adding a few well-placed beats, several string strikes, and a bit of grit, Duffy buffs up the faded, Dusty-Springfield, Memphis-soul memories, saluting \\"then\\" by renewing \\"now.\\"  However, she's still searching for a vocal style.  At times, Duffy delivers such an off-the-cuff, soulful swoon, it's scary.  But too many other times, she stoops to an Amy-Winehouse, swing-a-cat-by-its-tail yowl, as on the pilot single \\"Mercy.\\"  My suggestion?  Whenever Duffy plays police siren, concentrate on her band's brilliant arrangements until she gets her breath back.  Jump to \\"Stepping Stone\\" for a great example of how Duffy can stuff her sneer away and simply sing her heartache.  If there were more of this restraint, Rockferry would deliver Duffy to new shores.  She's still one to watch, but the cat's gotta go.

0316143472|4.0|I anxiously awaited the release of this book.  It was worth the anticipation.  I was laughing and giggling, and the kids were begging me to let them read it!  No way!  David Sedaris is his usual strange and interesting self.  Full of honest observations about himself and others he loves, this book is hilarious and poignant.  Very moving and Sedari as his best.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  Me Talk pretty One Day is the one that makes me laugh and that I hold all other Sedaris works up to for comparison.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This series follows the life of Henry V111 and his court.  We are drawn into the politics of the day as well as daily life at court.  Henry is passionate, sensual, playful, and all powerful.  His interactions with the women in his life are captivating.  The acting, costumes and sets are spectacular.   I am now inspired to read the \\"real story\\".  I am presently reading The Six Wives of Henry VIII by Alison Weir.  The book is even more fascinating than the series.  See the series, and if you want more, buy Alison's Weir book.  I recommend both highly!
0060899220|5.0|I am giving this book a 5/5 because throughout the whole book, you are entertained, and want to keep reading. You find out how he makes his way through the cooking career, how he makes his way to the top. This book describes to you what goes on behind the scenes in the kitches and how crazy it can be. I recommend this book to everyone!
B00164EAC8|1.0|This movie is a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the godzilla name. Matthew Broderick & the Iguana suck. You will be better off buying Godzilla 2000, which was the most amazing Godzilla movie ever.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|The first half hour shows lots of promise, but the kid is not a compelling character and can't break out of his nerdy image (spoken by a fellow nerd).  You know the plot points, so I won't recap. Some exciting chase action in a jungle, some fake-looking killer ants, and the rest of the movie is more concerned with spectacle than enjoyable action. That is to say, there is some action, but we're left thinking, so what?

B000NQPZCO|5.0|None of us knows what it's really like to go undercover. We think we do but we don't. Sure, we've watched the movies, read the books and all but what it's doing to your soul, your family life, everything, that it destroys all you have and feel, that is what this movie is about.  When Lefty (Al Pacino as a low level mobster) takes in Donnie (Johnny Depp as an undercover FBI agent) he tells him \\"Wiseguys are always right. Even when they're wrong they're right,\\" he is wrong. Dead wrong. He just doesn't know it yet.  Lefty treats Donnie as a son and Donnie gets emotionally involved. In his own way Lefty has a big heart, his hopes and dreams. But the dirt gets in the way and they don't materialize.   Bit by bit both Lefty's and Donnie's lives derail. Donnie starts losing his wife and kids and Lefty his rank in the (crime)family.  Can they do anything to save what's left? Do they want to and if so, what is more important, life as it was, friendship or the uncertain future? Does risking everything justify the costs?   Based on a true story this marvelous film shows the dirt as it is. Forget about the romance of other mobster movies and enter loyalty and misery. Both Al Pacino and Johnny Depp give larger than life performances. The supporting cast is terrific as is the directing. The 70s style indoor lighting helps turn it into a timeless masterpiece.  The Blu-ray disc is sharp as can be. This one should be in your collection.
033045367X|5.0|This is a poignant, compelling narrative about Chris McCandless, an intelligent, intense, and idealistic young man, who cut off all ties to his upper middle class family. He then reinvented himself as Alexander Supertramp, a drifter living out of a backpack, eking out a marginal existence as he wandered throughout the United States. A modern day King of the Road, McCandless ended his journey in 1992 in Alaska, when he walked alone into the wilderness north of Denali. He never returned.<br /><br />Krakauer investigated this young man's short life in an attempt to explain why someone who has everything going for him would have chosen this lifestyle, only to end up dead in one of the most remote, rugged areas of the Alaskan wilderness. Whether one views McCandless as a fool or as a modern day Thoreau is a question ripe for discussion. It is clear, however, from Krakauer's writing that his investigation led him to feel a strong, spiritual kinship with McCandless. It is this kindred spirit approach to his understanding of this young man that makes Krakauer's writing so absorbing and moving.<br /><br />Krakauer retraced McCandless' journey, interviewing many of those with whom he came into contact. What metamorphosed is a haunting, riveting account of McCandless' travels and travails, and the impact he had on those with whom he came into contact. Krakauer followed McCandless' last steps into the Alaskan wilderness, so that he could see for himself how McCandless had lived, and how he had died. This book is his epitaph.
B000002KD5|5.0|Great music, great memories. Music like this is still good to listen to after all these years. CD quality and case quality great. No delivery problems. Good purchase.
B000002I77|5.0|BILLY COBHAM'S INITIAL SOLO EFFORT FROM 1973, THIS ALBUM IS A TRUE CLASSIC OF ROCK-JAZZ FUSION MUSIC, FEATURING SOME BLISTERING GUITAR FROM THE LATE, GREAT, TOMMY BOLIN (OF DEEP PURPLE FAME) AND FELLOW MAHAVISHNU BANDMATE JAN HAMMER ON MOOG SYNTHESIZER.  I HAVE HAD THIS ALUM ON LP, CASSETTE, AND DD SINCE IT CAME OUT WAY BACK WHEN.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|This movie is both stupid and pointless. It is one long and dreary series of bad decisions by stupid people. It is sad and depressing for no good reason at all. There is no redeeming value to the pain and misery inflicted on the characters. It isn't worth making or watching a movie merely because the characters in the story suffer. For pointless suffering I can watch the news.<br /><br />Unless you are a masochist or need to become depressed, don't buy this movie. I am shredding my DVD to make sure it isn't inflicted on anyone else.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins did a great job at analyzing how companies go from Good to Great.    Jim and his staff of researchers were able to compile data on the great companies to compare with the mediocre or weaker companies. This data portrayed very well how simplicity is a key component to great success. The hedgehog concept displays how a simple idea can be useful. Staying away from confusion and too much clutter allows a company to stay focused on what they want to do. Also, finding the right people for the company philosophy makes establishing and maintaining a great company much easier.    The book was a great guideline for transforming average companies into great ones. He also established why reading both books would help in building great companies. He ties the concepts together very well.     I recommend this book to anyone who wants to go beyond being satisfied with success alone. Basically, everyone should remember to do what they do best and take control of those opportunities that are made available.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|1968 SOLO EFFORT FROM JEFF BECK, FEATURING ROD STEWART ON VOCALS, KEITH MOON, AYNSLEY DUNBAR, JOHN PAUL JONES, JIMMY PAGE, NICKY HOPKINS, AND OTHERS.  GREAT ALBUM, VERY BLUESY.  THIS IS JEFF BECK, POST-YARDBIRDS, AND PRE JAZZ FUSION MUSIC MODE.  IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME GREAT BRIT BLUES STARS, THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU.  MY FAVORITE CUT IS \\"AIN'T SUPERSTITIOUS\\", A CLASSIC. PLUS BONUS TRACKS THAT WEREN'T ON THE ORIGINAL ALBUM.
B000XV6VOK|5.0|Where do I begin with this magnificent show??? The entire production is absolutely BRILLIANT, from the impeccable acting to the GORGEOUS costumes. It is the absolute BEST thing I have EVER seen on television. The second season has been even BETTER than the first, with the king's relationship with Anne Boleyn being the main focus. Their love/hate, fiery, passionate relationship is delved into brilliantly by Jonathan Rhys Myers and Natalie Dormer, both of whom should receive acting awards this year. There are scenes from this season that are so incredibly unforgettable that they will always be with me. And that is the goal of an outstanding television show or movie - to TOUCH the viewer!  If I had to express any criticism whatsoever, it would only be that it was TOO SHORT - 10 episodes was NOT enough time to explore these complex relationships and the ensuing drama as Anne is unjustly accused and sent to her death.  It also is not entirely historically accurate, but I think we need to accept it for what it is - outstanding entertainment!!  If you enjoy historical drama and great acting, this show is for you!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|i preordered thiscd after hearing iton vh1, based uponthe 'mercy' hit, butshe has so much moreto offer on this cdthan that one song,great as it is!! shehas the most powerful voice i'veheard in along time,and from such a tinylittle thing! afterreading the amazoninfo. on her background i'm evenmore impressed! shewrites and sings from her heart andafter seeing her onshows like regis andleno, i think shewill win over peopleeverywhere! she isreal! she will havea great career in front of her. this is just the beginning!! this cdshows many of herfacets and my guessis that we will behearing from her fora long, long time tocome! i'm a 63 yr.old woman who lovesall kinds of music,and i would highlyrecommend this cd toeveryone!
B0000E2FLC|5.0|AC/DC is one of the best live rock bands ever! They really put on a show. This is a must have concert dvd for anyone into rock.
B0015519VS|4.0|This really is a good album. On my first listen, I immediately liked most of the songs. There are only a few songs that I'm not crazy about. They are still good songs, but just not my favorties. Some of my favorites are:    His Mistakes  Love In This Club Part 1 and 2  Something Special  Best Thing  What's Your Name  Moving Mountains  What's A Man To Do    I also really like the bonus track, however it takes a few minutes for it to start to play. I think the people who didn't like the album were probably expecting something similar to Confessions, but this album is different. In my opinion, however, it is still a solid album. Give it a chance if you are open to a different Usher.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a huge fan of Buffy when it was out, and bought the collectors edition package of that, so when I heard the Whedon had done Firefly I jumped on it and it was amazingly fun, such a pity these things get cancelled.
B0000027I6|3.0|imo, theres only about 1 lp worth of good music which is about 40min.    i get bored halfway through and his voice is shot. my fav track is 3 wishes i think.    i recommend pros and cons and radio kaos over this.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|While there's plenty of action in this movie, there's also a lot of deeper meaning. Questions that I think are very relevant, especially now.<br />For instance the idea that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. For me it gives some insight into the current situation in the middle east. The 'terrorists' don't think of themselves that way, they actually do think of themselves as fighting for the freedom of their people [at least most of the rank and file]. Trying to shuck the yoke of oppression that's kept them in poverty for so long.<br />[though I suspect that the people really oppressing them are their leaders; using various other targets as a scapegoat to divert suspicion from themselves the true oppressors]<br />But the scene that most resonates with me is after Evie [SPOILER ALERT!] has her revelation. After V tortures her, making her believe that Creedy's fingermen had her. When she finally has her epiphany; arms out stretched, looking up into the glory of the thunderstorm. \\"God is in the Rain\\" [SPOILER OVER]<br />The archetype of redemption struck right through me. The world changes as revelation pours over you. That moment comes I hope to all of us at one time or another, and the scene evokes it with shocking clarity.<br />I strongly recommend this film.
B0012GMUI6|5.0|my fav out of his 3.    radio kaos is great pop. amused is decent but boring.    fav tracks are apparantly they were traveling aboard,running shoes, sexual revolution, and pros and cons.    nice album cover     the final cut is slightly better if you consider that a waters solo album. hehe
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Say You Will is fast becoming one of my absolute favorite Fleetwood Mac albums. The bewitching Stevie and egregiously underrated Lindsey are creatively on their best form collaborating on such a fine body of work here, with highlights including the shimmering, instantly listenable Thrown Down (my favorite song on the album), Peacekeeper, Say You Will, Running Through The Garden, Silver Girl, Bleed To Love Her, Steal Your Heart Away, Miranda, Murrow Turning Over In His Grave, and Goodbye Baby. I love this entire album. It comes highly recommended from me.
B000VSBX34|5.0|For people from 60's like me, this is an outstanding movie. DVD quality is excellent.<br />Saludos, Allan.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|This movie has a stellar cast and the children do an excellent job acting, which in my opinion is rare. That was nicely complementary to the magical CGI effects. As an example, the Gyptian (sp?) ship was a pretty accurate representation of an sailing ironclad of the late 19th century. They really went the distance when it comes to detail.    This story is so rich that the movie tries to cram too much into too short a time. I hope for a Director's version with additional scenes inserted and not appended to the end. Lastly, I hope New Line displays some spine and produces the sequels. I'll definitely get them as this film has prompted me to get the books so I can enjoy the experience even more.
B00158K0S8|5.0|All I can say is wow. Most blue-ray movies don't really wow me. That's why I find it so funny that a movie from the 70's looks better then most new movies on blue-ray. If you can even just rent the movie give it a shot. This blue-ray of patton brings new life into an old film. 10/10!!
1594489505|4.0|If you read and liked [[ASIN:1594481776 The Kite Runner (Riverhead Essential Editions)]], you must read this one. However, if you haven't read the previous novel, you can still read it. Compared to Kite Runner there are not sharp turning points, unexpected plot twists but there you will still be surprised. Mr. Hosseini provides that. It is certainly a good fiction. I am expecting to see the author's new novels to come. But you can also read it as a sound description of a country's recent past. I remember reading in news how Soviets retreated, what kind of optimism in many circles - even in Turkey- emerged and then the shattering of all that hope. The novels gives you a good idea of that feeling...
B00005JPMZ|5.0|Being the major Turtles fan I am--and have been from the get-go--I was a bit weary when I heard about their venture into CGI. I mean seriously, with the wrong director, they could easily ruin our much beloved Turtles for future generations. We all, as fans, lucked out and are greeted with a terrific rendition with one of the best stories ever though.<br /><br />The story starts off with the Turtles in complete disarray. Leo is out of the country training to be a better leader, yet also trying to decide if his brothers are better off without him. Raph is out fighting baddies undercover as the metal-clad Nightwatcher. Don is keeping his nerdy schtick going strong by becoming an IT person. And Mikey is working for a party agency where he DRESSES UP AS A TURTLE. Love it.<br /><br />Enter Winters. He was granted immortality centuries ago for the sacrifice of his army. However, he's now set to resurrect his army so he won't be immortal anymore. They find this out and fight back. Then the Turtles come in.<br /><br />I think the greatest thing about this movie is that they centered the light-heartedness of the Turtles around a fairly intense storyline. Yeah, they still have their sense of humor about everything but the story is so dark, which only makes the movie that much better.<br /><br />If you ever liked the Turtles you owe it to yourself to check this out. For you young-uns out their, here's your chance to introduce yourself to the greatest ninjas ever. Here's hoping they continue the story and bring back the awesome Shredder. Fingers crossed!
B000M343BM|4.0|Possibly the best baseball comedy ever in the best edition yet...the documentary/interviews are at minimum interesting, and at least in the case of the Bob Uecker segment, occasionally hilarious.  Noteworthy for early appearances by Wesley Snipes and Rene Russo, and just a heck of a lot of fun.
0385339682|2.0|Willie Traynor was born in Memphis, but was educated in at Syracuse.  That makes him an outsider, and perhaps a Northerner, in the eyes of small-town Clanton, Mississippi residents.  When this fresh out-of-college youngster takes the reigns of the failing local newspaper, therefore, success is dubious.  Luckily for Mr. Traynor, a horrifying murder is just the headline to shock his newspaper back to profitability.    A young widower and mother is brutally raped and murdered by Danny Padgitt, the scion of an influential outlaw family.  Where once the Padgitt family was treated with fearful deference, Willie attacks head-on with bold front page stories and incriminating photography at substantial risk to himself and his business,.      Danny Padgitt is ultimately convicted, but surprisingly is spared the death penalty.  In open court, he swears revenge on the jury.  By greasing the wheels of the Mississippi penal system, the Padgitt family succeeds in getting Danny released after serving only 9 years.  Then, jurors start dying.    Though the plot is not without interest, this is certainly not one of John Grisham's better novels.  The foreshadowing, in particular, seems heavy-handed and will probably, for many, ruin or at least dampen any surprise at the conclusion.  I, having decided I had \\"figured out\\" the book about halfway through, found it difficult to slog through the last portion of the novel.  Likewise, the \\"Southern\\" color is laid on pretty heavily and, though I can claim to be no expert, appears fake-y.  Bountiful home-cooked meals fixed by a heavy-set, strongly religious, older black woman, for some reason, sets off my cliche-dar.  I also found the narrative point-of-view distracting.  The book felt, to me, more like an odd memoir than a riveting crime/legal thriller.    The book, however, does have the courtroom drama and the supporting extra-judicial action that makes a novel a Grisham novel.  The writing is easy and breezy - just the thing to pass some time on a beach or an airplane.  As a bonus, you may recognize some of the characters and settings from some of Grisham's other books - perhaps the beginning of a series exploring the depths of Clanton, Mississippi?
B001AG52AG|1.0|The series was great. I'm a complete atheist; but was raised by hardcore religious fanatics so I have to say I love anything that artfully attacks god and religion.     That being said - the books were great - they weren't really anti-theological so much as anti-Christian; but in fact what it did was bring the Christian religion into the realm of fiction where it belongs; brilliant.    The movie; though - was just, just terrible. Amazingly terrible. All of the interesting little nuances were leaving not so much a skeleton of a plot but rather assorted parts of a skeleton such as a femur, left shin, spine and foot all duct taped together incoherently.     Couple of examples - after diverting from the sequence of events in the book - using a thin bridge of ice over a huge, yawning canyon to separate two characters in order to 'merge' back into the original story. (i.e. the ice breaks after the first character (the one who belongs in the next scene) crosses) Give me a break.    Another example - when Nicole K (forget characters name) just RANDOMLY out of no where with no supporting conversation tells Lyra about the bear king's obsession. It's like - insulting the audience by making so, so sure that you are aware of this piece of information so you can see how smart Lyra is for making use of it later. It's a kids movie, not a developmentally disabled kids movie.    The one cool thing was the daemon's transformations; as far as effects went.    For character design - Iorek sucked; the uncle guy sucked (better if they had the magesterium leader guy play him (sauron)) . What was up with the bears armor? It's supposed to be utilitarian not all flowery and weird and crap (Iorek's) - actually Iofurs armor seems less ornate by comparison which is the opposite of the point.    Oh yeah - and the balloon guys jackrabbit was frickin' cool. He wasn't a bad character choice either...     Anyways - don't see this movie unless you are lame in which case you will probably like it. Readthe books, though. Oh yes, read them read them.
630463949X|5.0|After a long period apart (aside from a one-shot reunion for Bill Clinton's 1992 inauguration), the \\"Rumors\\" era line-up of Fleetwood Mac -- Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham -- reunited in 1997 and the results are breathtaking and magical.  This is a group of muscians who simply get better and better with age.  The opening number, \\"The Bridge,\\" brings all the pieces together for a stunning beginning, with the impeccable rhythym section of John McVie and Mick Fleetwood, the incredible guitar playing of Lindsay Buckingham (just watch him pluck the notes from his guitar, why the man is not mentioned in lists of guitar greats is a mystery to me), and the harmonizing of Christine Mcvie, Stevie Nick, and Buckingham.  All are in top form, although the voices of Nicks and Buckingham are not what they once were, but they still put every ounce of heart and soul into their performances.<br /><br />The band performs its classic numbers, mixing in a few new songs as well, and each of the singers (McVie, Nicks and Buckingham) perform their signature songs.<br /><br />But it's Lindsay Buckingham who simply steals the show (with Mick Fleetwood right behind him, joyously playing his drums).  He performs with passion and incredible musicianship, whether it's his mind-bogling guitar solo on \\"Big Love\\" to his performance of \\"Go Insane\\" and \\"I'm So Afraid.\\"<br /><br />Stevie Nicks also has her moments as well, particularly the emotional \\"Landslide\\" and \\"Silver Springs,\\" and the interaction on-stage between Buckingham and Nicks is intense, even if it's the two just exchanging a look.<br /><br />\\"The Dance\\" on DVD includes many songs not on the CD release and is well worth the purchase for that reason.  This is an early-era DVD -- one of the first, really, so for the 21st century viewer, this is not something that is going to look very good on your 52-inch high-def television.  It's full-screen, non-anamorphic and looks slightly better than the VHS version.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is very good, though, and surround sound is used extensively, with a lot of activity in the rear channels.<br /><br />There are no extras, this being an early DVD, but there is an option to enable on-screen lyrics which is a nice touch if you're like me and want to know what exactly is being sung.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac continued in early 2003 with \\"Say You Will\\" and followed that album with a tour (without Christine McVie, unfortunately) and The Mac was still in fine form, even better than they were in 1997.<br /><br />It would be nice to see a remastered, updated version of this DVD, with perhaps some interviews with the band to get their perspective on the reunion.  Until that happens, this will have to do.  Sit back, turn up the sound, and be prepared to be blown away.gital 5.1 track is very good, though, and surround sound is used extensively, with a lot of activity in the rear channels.

B00068TJM6|5.0|I purchased this SNA-411 from Amazon due to my trust in the fact it was authentic and not a \\"Replica\\" from China.<br /><br />It actually is a much bigger watch than I expected and I'm still getting used to the size and weight. It keeps accurate time (Quartz movement) and I trust the name Seiko. Getting the pins out to adjust the watchband was an interesting experience and there was little to no help from Seiko in explaining the direction arrows on the inside of the band. Were they for inserting the pins or taking them out? The response I received from my email to Seiko was \\" take it to a qualified Seiko service center.\\" Please...<br /><br /> The outer dial and bezzle have the smallest printing I have ever seen on a watch. I didn't know that anyone could print so small. From what I can (and can't) see, the only real good this watch is for is keeping time, the stopwatch function and novelty. There is absolutely NO way you are going to be able to use this in flight to calculate anything... bring a full sized E6B.<br /><br />I purchased it as a \\"fun\\" watch and I got exactly what I was looking for along with Seiko quality.<br /><br />Mike
B0014KD46W|3.0|I am a little disappointed with Steve Winwoods's latest CD \\"Nine Lives\\". Sound is OK, vintage Steve Winwood. But after previous \\"About Time\\" the new CD seems a little stale. Especially dissapointing is the guest appearance of Eric Clapton- the song is OK but he used too much distortion in the guitar solo. Being a lifelong fan, this certainly won't keep me from checking out Steve's next effort.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|My wife and I love this movie. It's a fairy tale for adults along the line of Princess Bride (another favorite). The story is interesting, the characters are engaging, and the cameo by Robert DeNiro is not only fantastic, but very funny.
0143038419|4.0|I am almost finished reading this book and thought someone needed to throw in a positive comment since most of the recent ones are so negative.  I have read reviews on other sites as well and a lot of people, myself included, have said they could really relate to some of her relationship experiences and were truly inspired by her journey and travels. This is her life for crying out loud, so to be so opinionated about her experience is baffling!  How can you fault her for her \\"American self -absorption?\\" Of course we have a different perspective that other countries. And I'm not saying that's a good thing, it just is. So, if other cultures have a better outlook, why not travel and learn other better ways to be?  She readily states that she was in a time of deep emotional crises and so like most of us, keeps having all the repetitive  \\"Why me's?\\" that keep coming up at times like these. Yes you question yourself, over everything, over and over and over again. It's the human condition, people.   And so, whoever finds fault with the process she had to go through, well, \\"Congratulations on the Enlightenment, Sister. Happy for ya!\\"     I have been studying Buddhist meditation for 3 years. It is a hard thing to do and not just some woo-woo, hippy-dippy dancing around the Maypole exercise. Sitting with your thoughts in silence for days on end is not pretty. It is hard, cathartic, and can be liberating if you are dedicated to the practice. I'm betting most of these naysayer's wouldn't last 5 minutes attempting this!    It's too bad the folks who didn't bother to read past the first few chapters, as they missed her passage into peace, happiness and compassion.  Of course, it was all directed inward at first that was the whole point! That was her inspiration for setting off on this journey and the fact she was already a successful writer and was given a book advance gave her the means to do this. Which she says was the not case with her travels in the earlier in her life.  Just prior to this I read \\"Three Cups of Tea\\" a truly amazing book about another person's experience coming through trials and tribulations to a place of peace and helping others. The co-author David Relin, was also criticized for his writing style which myself and others found to easy to read, considering all the drama Greg Mortenson found himself in.  I cans see that her writing style can be almost too conversational at times, with lots of things in parentheses and caps, but again she was emphasizing her life and the torrent of thoughts during this time.   It's one thing to just not have an interest in the storyline but quite another to be so ruthless about someone sharing their innermost journey.  I'm betting all those nasty folks would never have the balls to publish their life story and then have your personal struggles bashed by the whiny self-righteous public!!  Go back to reading trite bodice-ripper's if you don't want to hear all the raw, messy, beautiful stories of another person's REAL life!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I dont think I really need to write a review, everyone should already own this album.  If you haven't, just take care of that.
B0012IV3RS|4.0|...This is the sort of thing they like. This disc is one of many Blue Underground reissues of Italian horror titles formerly offered by Anchor Bay; even the on-screen menus are the same. As to the movie itself...let's face it: Lucio Fulci was no great director, but he was on a roll at this point with some notable horror outings. THE NEW YORK RIPPER stands apart from ZOMBIE, and others, in that it is a straight murder story with no supernatural elements. It does, however, offer some endearing goofiness (gotta love that duck-voiced killer), and plenty of what most fans expect from a Fulci title: hard-core gore with no apology.<br />As such, I recommend this one to Fulci fanatics and Eurotrash junkies. By the way: when is someone going to release CAT IN THE BRAIN??
B0018CA996|4.0|I took a gamble on this album after listening to the samples. I think I should be a gambling man as it was a good purchase. I picked this bad boy up a few days ago and it has been playing on my zen ever since. listen to this album...then listen to it again and I promise you, you will like it. The first half of the album takes me for a ride, then the middle is forgettable, and the last 2-3 tracks brings me back to my \\"I'm cool\\" state of mind.
B000TSIK14|5.0|Quite simply put, I grew up listening to Scorpions and by far, this is their best album ! Very mature song writing, refined music, and a very easy listen to like immediately.  I'm only upset that this came out last year and I didn't get it sooner to enjoy it - a whole year of enjoying this gone!    GET IT!           There's a Humanity Hour II??? Can't wait now.....
B0001O3YD0|3.0|There are some suspenseful moments. The action scenes are OK. The plot is so so.    It's worth watching once.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I was impressed with the first disc and disappointed with the second disc.  Also, there were very few b-sides, but that's neither here nor there.  I don't know, if Dave wanted to release some slow stuff then he should have released a solo album of content from the second disc.  But like I said, first disc, hard-hitting, epic and a return to full form.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|It's one of the worst horror/fantasy movies of all times. The worst thing is the special effects. For example, when Van Helsing was shooting the bats with his crossbow, the scene looked like a painted picture. The same thing happened in many other scenes. The acting is so so. The plot reveals nothing new about this genre.
B000020617|4.0|What else can I say, I didn't truly appreciate this album until I saw some of the material played live, like, \\"Aurora.\\"  Or, simply have low expectations when you first put the album in, and make sure you've heard none of the other Foo Fighters albums beforehand.
B00005JL3A|1.0|The pecial effects look exactly like that of a computer game, not real. The action is the top. There's no plot. It's not woth watching.
B000QEIORG|5.0|I wish Dave would have produced 3 more of these prior to Echoes, because the in-between was rather dull when not radio singles.
0792164903|5.0|It's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The scenes look scary. The acting and action are good. It's suspenseful from the beginning till the end.
B0000CAXID|5.0|I wish Kurt were here to here this, of course, he was probably there when some of the material was tested - infact this very well could have made the next Nirvana album.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|It's one of the worst movies starting Keanu Reeves. The plot is ridiculous. The special effects are below par. There's no suspense nor horror here.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|R.E.M.: Accelerate - Welcome Back R.E.M.!  Much like how; Aerosmith, Pearl Jam and Flamming Lips all had to reinvent themselves to become relevant again, R.E.M. must have reflected deeply upon their extensive library and decided to become rather vengeful, once again.    This album seems to have already caught headlines from every magazine that circulates the globe and from each a relatively positive, if not overwhelmingly positive, review.  If you haven't read one of these review, then maybe you've noticed pictures of the band or lead singer, Michael Stipe, on a cover.  This sort of publicity is almost impossible to buy for the majority of bands, but for R.E.M. it's just life as usual when they actually try on an album.    So what do I mean when spouting out words like, \\"reinventing, relevant and try?\\"  That's easy to answer, listen to the album once and you'll know what I mean.  And this won't take much time, because this is R.E.M.'s shortest album that they've ever recorded, coming in at under 35 minutes.  So short of a time-span that it can only fit 11 tracks, which makes the album only one track longer than the shortest tracked album of 10.  There's no clean computerized synthesizer or inexplicably, impossible-without-studio, cuts.  Accelerate, is simply an album that was written out of pure neurotic explosion, and equally by each individual member.  The base guitar bounces around playfully, sounds wonderful and not drowned-out like bands from the 2000's, the guitar is fast and full of rhythm similar to a more youthful R.E.M. of ole and the drums again bang away, even though without longtime drummer, Bill Berry, Ministry's Bill Rieflin fills the roll perfectly - we're not talking nuclear science with R.E.M.'s drumming, but that still doesn't make Bill Rieflin an honorary member, yet.  So the basics, which speak volumes, are all present for the making of a modern-classic, but what do the vocals sound like, are the lyrics personable and does the album hold up?When I first listened to, Accelerate, I instantly enjoyed the music, but thought there was something amiss.  The further I dove into the album, the more I realized that the music was great, but that the vocals were a little off.  Sure, it sounded like Mike, but still, he didn't sound as convicted as usual, almost as if the music was faster-paced than he could handle.  And so I listened, and listened and listened some more to this album (as I do now with most albums) and what I came up with was that this is just the theme of the album mixed-in with a little with Stipe's age.  But overall, this is signature R.E.M. sound, it just takes week's worth of radioplay to be addicting.  And you know what the thing is, this album consists of a lot of repeatable & memorable material, most of which fans might have forgot R.E.M. was capable of composing.  So now that I've finally gotten a grasp of what might take the average listener an estimated 3 weeks of listening to, I'm willing to stand firm on saying this album is damn good.  The lyrics, nothing new to R.E.M.; personal, political, a little coded but also could be interpreted as ultra-direct.  While I've heard comments that mention, \\"Man on the Moon-ish,\\" I lean towards an album with songs that range between a mix of, \\"Drive,\\" \\"The One I Love,\\" and variations of yes, material from, Monster, specifically, \\"Star 69.\\"  I actually enjoy most of the album, and respect the fact that I didn't love it on first spin, because it most definitely takes time to grow on you, but when you get there, it's oh so rewarding.  One thing                                                               Album Highlights: All of it - minus \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\"          Rating 9.5 out of 10
B000F6IOBQ|4.0|The action is quick, and vicious. It's more like an action than a horror film. And it's a good action movie. There's not much suspense and no scary moment as in Blade II. Kate Beckinsale looks sexy in her black leather suite.
B000IU3XTW|4.0|A great band, an excellent idea, just barely missed the perfect mark, because of few covers, and lackluster playability on popular singles.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|The action scenes are exciting, and fast paced. The exciment never dies down for the whole movie. There's nothing new in the plot but I don't care. This is one of the most interesting films starring Wesley Snipes. It's also the best of the trilogy.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The musical offers a story that all should see as it breaks down barriers and makes us skeptical of authority as we search for truth and do what is just in the world. The music, of course, gives the show its pizaz and awe, and the show would die without it. Though the CD pales in comparison to a live performance, it brings back all of the memories from your day in the theater. It is a must have for all who fell in love with Wicked because it keeps the story alive and in our hearts as time passes.
B0001WTUH6|1.0|It's not a good horror movie. The action is not exciting. The plot is so so. And so is the acting. There's no horror nor suspense here.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|I love Gerard Butler in 300 and thought Attila was ok.  This movie is absolutely horrible.  First let's define the characters.  The troll and his dad are best described as Neanderthal men with lots of body hair and apparently large plastic deltoids (shoulder muscles) that look incredibly fake.  The movie starts with the Neanderthal men howling and babbling like deranged infants and believe me you will have plenty of opportunity to listen to this jibber jabber come from the Troll (only the country whore Selma seems somehow be able to translate this Neanderthal language).  Then the Danes and their king easily kill Grendel's father when Grendel himself was just a wee little Neanderthal boy with white hair all over his face.  Grendel is pissed and later is able to kill hundreds of Danes quite easily (but if you are looking for action don't as there is NO real fight scenes in this movie you just see the after shot).  Why on earth is Grendel such a power house when his Dad was able to easily be killed in his prime?  Your right it does not make any sense but if it did it would not belong in this movie.     Back to Selma.  Anyway she is a \\"witch\\" and a self describe \\"whore\\" who Beowulf seems to kind of fall in love with but not really but who cares?  Her hair is best described as the fashion one would see after someone had been living underground and washing their hair with worm guts for ten years and despite the fact that it rains everyday her hair magically says dry and dirty for the film.  If that isn't a reason enough for Beowulf to fall for her (besides the fact she is a whore) then there is the fact that the Troll also comes a knockin' as he has taken quite a fancy to the little witch.  Anyway the meandering story looks as if you are finally going to see some action when the Troll comes to attack the Danes and Beowulf (he apparently has a big conscious and would not attack Beowulf and his men until they urinated on his house/cave entrance and smashed his Dad's shrunken skull {which was the decoration for Grendel's cave}.  But instead of action you see the Troll instantly kill Beowulf's men with one blow but no way can he with Beowulf, no he just hits him a few times and then looks at him longingly as Beowulf ties a rope on his hand??? What the heck?  Then the Troll jumps off the roof and is hanging there.  He is apparently too tired or weak to reach up and cut the rope from his hand that Beowulf tied so he does what anyone would . . . cut off his whole arm????   WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?  This guy is monster strong and he makes one weak attempt to reach up and cut the rope then says ah who cares I have another arm let me just go ahead and resect this whole arm, not at the wrist mind you the shoulder which make perfect sense-NOT.  Also the soldiers were apparently dancing and drinking or something because no archer comes to shoot him hanging there, they only show up after he is running away into the night.  I could bore you with the one dimensional king who is a whiney and annoying character with a wife who likes to slap him or the crazy Celtic priest who occasionally pops up but I hope I have saved you from wasting your time.  Re-watch 300 or Troy.
B00008EY65|3.0|This movie has some funny scenes. The special effects are so so. One thing I don't like is the disguise of the main character. It's obvious his  is wearing a mask and what looks like a plastic suit.<br /><br />It's worth watching.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|The premise and plot of this movie are really surprisingly simple: think of a Godzilla movie from the human victims' point of view, and set it in New York.  This movie avoids many common Hollywood disorders:  There are no big name actors.  Special effects are used appropriately.  The \\"camcorder perspective\\" generates a very genuine, intimate feel.  The main characters (just average people) do not pick up over-sized weapons and take on the \\"monster\\".  There is no pointless over-explanation about what attacked the city.    In short, I found this movie to be good fun.  Along with the suspense and action one would expect from this sort of film, characters were developed enough for them to have believable motivations and for the audience to care.    Many have complained that there was too much camera shake in this film.  Though I thought it was over-done, I am quite surprised by claims that people have become nauseated watching this movie.  I, personally, have absolutely no stomach for roller coasters and the like, which quickly make me ill, yet I have watched this movie in the theater and on DVD and found the camera shake to be merely annoying.
B00004STUL|5.0|There quite a few funny scenes and dialogues. It contains non-stop actions. Will Smith's and Martin Lawrence's acting are engating. I own it.
1423101464|5.0|My 12 year old son loved this book, he finished it in 3 days.  He has also read all of the others in the series and can not wait for the next one to come out.  He does NOT like to read but it is mantatory in his school to read a book every 2 weeks, so when we discovered this series, it was a blessing.
0767834739|1.0|It's another bad zombie movie. Compared to the majority of thhe others, the only difference here is the main character is a female. The plot is the same. The action scenes are not engaging. Special effects  are so so.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|This is another movie made from a PK Dick short story.  While thoroughly enjoyable, it suffers from one flaw that I cannot write about without spoinling the ending.  Dick has a wonderful way of creating scientific abilities without explaining how they work.  In this case, the Nicholas Cage character can see 4 minutes into the future and change the outcome of events by taking action in the present.  It's a pretty clever twist on time travel stories.  He finds a woman (Jessica Biel) who \\"amplifies\\" his power so that when he is in her presence he can see much further ahead.  Again, no explanation - it's just accepted as part of the story.  I recommend this movie if you are a time travel / science fiction buff.  Otherwise, the story is a little flat and the relationships are superficial.  Although I did enjoy Julianne Moore in a tough-guy role that we don't usually see her in.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|Until they do something completely groundbreaking, ToAD won't be able to shake its association with Chad Kroeger/Nickelback because of their method of discovery coupled with their 604-RoadRunner Records contracts management.    However, that doesn't mean Tyler Conn0lly and the rest of Theory of A Deadman are incapable of producing enjoyable music.  \\"Scars and Souvenirs\\" is a great example of musical maturation by a band with incredible potential.  Though the album's sound and lyrical content are by no means revolutionary or particularly insightful, there are indications that the band is taking necessary steps to find its own niche in mainstream alternative.  The arrangements, schizophrenic as they are, seem to be less palatable than those of Nickelback's, and there is a genuine nature behind Connolly's writing.    Compared with their debut and sophomore albums, \\"S&S\\" isn't afraid to venture for a slightly more mellow approach, instead of drilling songs into your brain.  Nonetheless, this album is more than worthy of a listen.
6305537321|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's was one of my mother's favorite movies.  Many times, late at night, you could find yourself outside her TV room listening to her croon the words to Moon River along with the TV.  Many times I'd catch the end of the movie, with Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard and that cat.  And the rain.  Can't forget the rain.  I thought it was all 60s and sentimentality.      Then I rented it for myself.  I had to see what this classic was all about.  I was surprised at how racy it was.  How wild the 60s gold diggers party was.  How crass Peppard's patron was.      And then there were long moments of atmosphere, where I almost fell asleep and missed the whole point.  Because when our heroine finds she must make a choice between remaining the way she is and taking a chance on love, it is anything but sentimentality.      Movies today are just not as smart as this one.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|I was never a fan of music that had screaming and for the longest time I though BFMV was just another screaming band.  I can remember the first time I heard \\"Tears Don't Fall\\" and thinking, \\"Omigosh this is the greatest song ever!\\" Then I remember hearing \\"Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow\\" and thought, \\"No... THIS is the greatest song ever!\\" Then again with \\"4 Words (To Choke Upon).\\"  Let's just get right to the point here... BFMV is INCREDIBLE! There are like 3 songs that I will not listen to on \\"The Poison,\\" but the majority of them are amazing.  The music is perfect.  The screaming is perfect.  The lyrics are perfect.  But I think the main reason why BFMV receives positive attention is the crispness and clarity of all of their songs.  Every note, every riff, everything is organized perfectly and each song flows beautifully.  Even if you're not a huge fan of screaming music, BFMV is different.  Their songs have meaning and it's hard to deny that these guys from Wales have serious raw talent and \\"The Poison\\" is dripping with said talent.  I only started listening to BFMV about six months ago, but it's easy to say that they are my favorite band.  \\"Scream Aim Fire,\\" their second studio album, however, does not keep the bar set high for BFMV.  I feel that whenever I listen to \\"Scream Aim Fire\\" the crispness that I love so much in \\"The Poison\\" just isn't there.  It's as though they spent way less time producing their second album than their first.  I recommend that EVERYONE (doesn't matter what age you are or your musical tastes) rushes out and buys this album.  It's flawless.  Five stars.    Standout Tracks:  Her Voice Resides 10/10  4 Words (To Choke Upon) 10/10  Tears Don't Fall 10/10  Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow 10/10  Hit the Floor 9/10  All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me) 7/10  Room 409 9/10  The Poison 7/10  Cries in Vain 10/10  My Fist, Your Mouth, Her Scars (Bonus Track) 10/10    I also highly recommend several songs from BFMV's self-titled LP.Either buy the album or simply download these couple songs.  They really are worth it.    Turn to Despair (possibly one of their best songs ever) 10/10  Hand of Blood 10/10  Just Another Star 9/10
B00005JPCF|1.0|My husband I were in Blockbuster one Friday night, and they had a preview for a penguin movie. The water was mesmerizing, the image so beautiful, I could hardly wait to watch it with the kids.    When we rented Happy Feet, I was excited to finally see that beautiful penguin movie. Or so I thought. What I saw instead was a bunch of penguins singing Prince songs, among other things. Warner brothers was showing off its music catalog with Happy Feet, but I don't know what they were doing as far as movies go. That was a jumbled mess with Robin Williams playing like 5 characters and a bunch of loopy tap dancing numbers. Savion Glover looks like a street person in the scary special features section too. That loopy Prince song playing in the credits messed me up man. I kept shaking my head to erase that bad trip.    Based on an ancient cartoon about an opera singing papa owl with an `Owl' Jolson son, Happy Feet is a fish out of water story. Sort of. Then there's a weird plot line about finding the aliens who polluted the water and got rid of the fish, and then the deal about the penguins can communicate by tap dancing, and how that even catches man's attention. And they all get fish! I think. Because by that point I was gone. Couldn't. take. it. any. longer!    I was still shuddering weeks later when Surf's Up appeared in the mail. I saw the beautiful water, but I was still muttering \\"I can't believe!\\" under my breath. I mean, Happy Feet! It looked so promising!    Then the movie started. It was like a documentary. I laughed, and continued laughing for the whole movie. Except for the brief minutes when I fell asleep. But that's just me. It's a rare movie that doesn't put me to sleep. I think that would be about 2 movies, tops. But I digress.    Surf's Up was just so funny. And cute. And what a great story. I don't want to give any more away. Rent it, immediately! Then tell me how right I am.    The kids didn't know how bad Happy Feet was until they saw Surf's Up. Their brows furrowed as the wave of realization hit them. All penguin movies are not alike!    They couldn't discern as much when the comparison was between Finding Nemo and Shark's Tale. They had actually prefered the ghetto alternative mess to the timeless classic. They're all too young to catch the nuances of difference between Bug's Life and Antz and Ant Bully.    But Surf's Up and Happy Feet? Even the 3 year old knows.

B000VAHBL0|5.0|On this legendary album, Reed celebrates Andy Warhol and his 15-minute of fame stars in a variety of styles partly influenced by David Bowie. The new edition includes two extra tracks, acoustic versions of Hanging Round and Perfect Day. The informative insert includes illustrations and an essay on the history of Reed and the significance of this album.<br /><br />Transformer is a type of decadent cabaret comparable to Bowie's [[ASIN:B0000009NJ Aladdin Sane]], but less bleak, more colourful and life-affirming. Reed proved himself to be a master of many styles, from the compelling rock of Walk On The Wild Side through the tender and tuneful pop of Satellite Of Love to the dreamy Perfect Day, a haunting poetic excursion.<br /><br />Other highlights include the edgy rocker Vicious with its hypnotic melody and sarcastic/ironic lyrics (an attitude that would soon infuse punk and new wave), the quirky New York Telephone Conversation, the energetic Hanging Round and the stately Goodnight Ladies. The songs are highly descriptive of a time, a place and a mindset whilst the music is powerful and elegant.<br /><br />The stylistic variety renders Transformer compelling throughout while not detracting from the cohesion, making it a great piece of musical theatre. Devoted followers would agree that it does not reveal the complete Reed, as he has been so prolific and his oeuvre encompasses a much larger spectrum. But as a document of the middle seventies, it remains superb, an essential album for all serious rock fans.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|Indiana Jones' thrilling return to the big screen was well worth the wait. \\"Crystal Skull\\" packs all the classic feel and action of a good ol' Indy flick with the added talent & charm of Transformer's Shia LaBeouf as well as slick CGI effects. However those CGI effects don't take the place of traditional stunt work where the film shines with its action scenes. Also present is plenty of comedic moments aided by Harrison Ford's one-liners and Shia LaBeouf's usual fun performance. Pack it up with splendid storytelling that unfolds the puzzle of a plot and John Williams epic score, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a winner. I had my doubts that this film could pull it off after so many years and an aged Harrison Ford but there's something about Indiana Jones that's timeless.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|So a lot of people are saying that this is overhyped, not memorable, or a rip off of old music. Well I think you guys need to stop trying to categorize music into something you recognize. VW has come along with a new, catchy, and quite enjoyable CD that is good for listening. If you believe that what other musicians have done should affect what this CD is about, get a life. Music is simply for entertainment, and this album comes through there for sure.
B0013J30XG|4.0|Perhaps the most underrated film this summer, Speed Racer was a completely enjoyable film to a watch; a wonderful experience that was made to be seen on the big screen. It's hard to understand why so many critics hated this movie. It's got action, style, and heart. Sure it's a \\"family film,\\" but it's a damn good one. It's rare to find a family film this sweet. Now doubt in my mind, the Wachoski brothers have another hit on their hands but this time around, no one seems to see it.<br /><br />The visual style of Speed Racer is trippy and unique. A wide range of colors filled the screen which equally match the vibrant intensity and fun tone of the film. All the cars have that retro trendy look including the newly-designed Mach 6. And the good ol' Mach 5's never looked better. At times I didn't even realize some of the backdrops were CGI because they were just so stunning to see. The Wachoski Bros have really created a \\"live-action anime\\" by presenting a look and feel that isn't quite fully 2-D or 3-D. Never before have I seen the artistic creativity as seen in Speed Racer. Sure I wouldn't have minded a full photo-realistic update like what last year's Transformers did, but alas it wouldn't be the same.<br /><br />Another postive aspect of Speed Racer was the sound design and musical score. Thank god the Wachowski's didn't keep the repetitive & droning \\"vroom\\" sound from the original anime show. Instead there are various sounds of every possible noise a car can make from a super engine revving to the remarkable crashes and stunts seen in the film. What they did keep was the unforgettable echoing \\"chyu-chyu-chyu\\" of the jump jacks and the Speed Racer theme. The composer of Speed Racer's music, the award-winning Michael Giacchino (Ratatouille, Lost), reworks the original Speed Racer theme to parts of his score along with his own. Speed Racer's music is more than solid and adds much to this already remarkable film. All together, I couldn't have asked more for the sound design of the movie.<br />(*Fact tidbit* The Speed Racer theme song in the US and Japan have the same melody)<br /><br />Kudos to the casting selection because the actors not only look but act and feel like the original characters. Emile Hirsch surprisingly made a great Speed and Christina Ricci's large eyes and sweet demeanor were meant to play Trixie. John Goodman was a spot-on Pops Racer and Susan Sarandon sure felt like a mother as Mom Racer. Lost's Matthew Fox nailed the role of Racer X's mystique and confident valor. The rest of the cast was swell as well - there was definitely an aspiring chemistry between the actors giving Speed Racer a very convincing performance. In addition, I appreciate casting's choice to keep it ethnically diverse with actors like Korean superstar Rain, Australian Kick Gurry, English Roger Allam, Chinese actress Yu Nan, Benno F&uuml;rmann of Germany, and skilled Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada. Last of all on the note of casting, how could I forget the inclusion of Peter Fernandez's cameo as a race commentator? As the director and writer of the US adaptation of the Speed Racer television show as well as the original voice of Speed & Racer X, it would've been a crime not to include this legendary man.<br /><br />A few parts of the film I had mixed feelings on but nothing about the film did I completely dislike. The scenes with Spritle & Chim Chim got pretty stupid and annoying...of course scenes with them in the original show were just that! The story could've been more dynamic and less complex in its presentation. There are some parts in the middle that unfortunately slow down the movie a little and the whole anti-corporations plot line becomes overly wordy in its dialogue. More time could have been spent on fleshing out the backstories presented in the beginning. Those felt somewhat rushed although they were sufficient. Finally, some of the CGI was a bit too cartoony for my taste such as Royalton's factory filled with Segway traveling workers and the bubbling escape pod-like mechanism of the cars.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the Speed Racer movie. It left me completely content and satisfied. Some scenes had me to tears (death of Rex Racer, Speed's final struggle) and others had me on the edge of my seat as cars zoomed about the twisting and curving racetrack. I really couldn't ask more from Speed Racer. Aside from the Death Note films, Speed Racer's one of the best live-action anime adaptations and it's a shame it probably won't be expanded further (the Wachoski Brothers have plot ideas that would make Speed Racer a trilogy but it is unlikely those ideas will be fulfilled after Speed Racer's unfortunate low box-office performance). Hopefully, it can rebound enough from sales of related products and DVD sales to make Warner Bros. reconsider continuing this wonderful start to a trilogy.<br /><br />4 stars out of 5<br /><br />GO SPEED RACER GO!chanism of the cars.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|Quite possibly one of the most expensive movies in history and definitely one of the years most highly anticipated, Spider-Man 3 finally premiered last of all last Friday, May 4th, 2007 (It opened everywhere else internationally on May 1st). I was fortunate enough to attend my local theater's midnight premiere of the film and at the cineplex, anyone could have told you this movie was anticipated. But in the end, how did it measure up?<br /><br />First off, the positives of the film. One of Spider-Man 3's best aspects undoubtedly was the special effects. SM3 utilized a new array of computer graphics programs given for use by Sony exclusively. And it sure paid off - New York never looked more brilliant, Sand-Man had lots of clear...sand, Venom was looking ferocious and more daunting than any other SM villain, and of course Spidey himself was in top-notch shape. All the fight scenes were thrilling to experience and the transitions from live-action actors and settings to CGI were seamless. Tied along with direction by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man 3 has developed into a visual delight for film goers and Spidey fans alike.<br /><br />It also appears the crew didn't slack off in the areas of sound design and musical score either. All the sound effect and engineering was beautifully done. Pieces of a New York skyscraper falling apart, landing down below produced realistic impact effects. Most notably were the voice effects done with Venom's character: the shrilling heart-piercing cries and screams of the symbiotic villain frightening that I ever anticipated. Accompanying throughout the film was of course, the musical score. This time around SM3 featured a different composer than the original Danny Elfman of the first films, due to rough times working with Raimi the composer said. The film's new composer (Christopher Young) decided to keep the already existing themes of Spider-Man and the Goblin intact and with the new themes and scores, managed exquisitely to retain the wondrous feel of Elfman's original score while still creating a whole new tone for the third film.<br /><br />The picture's acting was overall well performed and convincing. The three title roles played by Tobey Maguire, James Franco, and Kirsten Dunst should never be replaced in my humble opinion and the casting of these three was one of the best decisions I've ever seen for any comic book movie or movie at that. The same applies to Rosemary Harris and JK Simmons as Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson, respectively. However, the villains are a different story. Casting of Venom and Sand-Man are not bad, per se just not the best I thought they could have been. Yet in no way did the actors bring the production's quality down in any way.<br /><br />Next, the not-so-great parts of Spider-Man 3. A major complaint made by many including myself is the film's inclusion of too many villains and storylines. So much of the film felt rushed. Sand-Man seemed a bit unnecessary and wasn't nearly as daunting as previous villains in the series. Venom at times seems cartoony and his presence in the film was fleeting. With both of these villains, there could have been much more time dedicated to devleoping their characters and such. By the final \\"boss fight\\" like sequence, it'd felt that the characters had been somewhat rushed and underdeveloped. Venom especially had so much potentially, being one of Spider-Man's most iconic and deadly villains. Again, less storylines and more emphasis on a few.<br /><br />Humor. In the first and second Spider-Man films, comedic sequences were added at just the right amount, like sprinkling on an ice cream sundae. Unfortunately, Sam Raimi enjoyed dousing on the sprinkles too much with our Spider-Man 3 sundae, saturating the film with humor, an unbelievable amount of it. In fact, you could almost consider the film a comedy at times. While funny at first, the humor sequences started appearing in scenes where they really didn't need to be and completely ruined the seriousness and concentration of other scenes. Many times throughout the film I wondered, \\" Why? Raimi, Why?!\\"<br /><br />Finally, Spider-Man 3 exhibited something I thought was on par if not better than any of the other films at that. The ending. With what was already laid out and done, I don't think Raimi could have given us any better of an ending than he already did. Sure Venom was killed of a but too quickly and abruptly, but he had to be for heaven's knows if there will be a Spider-Man 4, especially with the massive mixed reviews coming out from critics. The final battle sequence will go down as one of the most epic in all of film history. It is the one point in the film in which we truly see what Sand-Man and especially Venom can do. 3's ending battle sequence also featured a brilliant Spidey team up with the enlightened Harry Osborn. At last there is the movie's gorgeous, emotional ending. As Sand-Man explains what really happened to Ben Parker, we finally see Peter find closure and he heroically forgives the Sand-Man. The last image of the sandy Flint Marco is of his dissipated grained body flowing throughout New York, presumably to finally help his daughter. Lastly is the death of the troubled Harry Osbourn who at last proved his heroics  and forgiveness of his true best friend. The New York morning sun rises and Harry slowly slips into death, creating the saddest ending of any comic book movie. Shockingly, I had a few tears roll down my cheek as peace unraveled on screen. What can I say? Beautiful. Just beautiful.<br /><br />Overall, at this point, I'd have to put Spider-Man 3 on just about same level as the second one however if not a little lower. The worst aspects of the movie in this film were really prominent in this time around. As to how it compares to the rest of the series and whether it really deserves a 4/5, I won't be able to make that call until I rewatch Spider-Man 3 once more. But I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.<br /> For everyone else, just go see it!<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 : Three out of Five<br />- = Too many villians and storylines running, excessive humor, less-than-perfect villain casting<br />+ = Amazing special effects, spectacular fight scenes and sound effects, good music score, very emotional and beautiful ending.Many times throughout the film I wondered, \\" Why? Raimi, Why?!\\"    Finally, Spider-Man 3 exhibited something I thought was on par if not better than any of the other films at that. The ending. With what was already laid out and done, I don't think Raimi could have given us any better of an ending than he already did. Sure Venom was killed of a but too quickly and abruptly, but he had to be for heaven's knows if there will be a Spider-Man 4, especially with the massive mixed reviews coming out from critics. The final battle sequence will go down as one of the most epic in all of film history. It is the one point in the film in which we truly see what Sand-Man and especially Venom can do. 3's ending battle sequence also featured a brilliant Spidey team up with the enlightened Harry Osborn. At last there is the movie's gorgeous, emotional ending. As Sand-Man explains what really happened to Ben Parker, we finally see Peter find closure and he heroically forgives the Sand-Man. The last image of the sandy Flint Marco is of his dissipated grained body flowing throughout New York, presumably to finally help his daughter. Lastly is the death of the troubled Harry Osbourn who at last proved his heroics  and forgiveness of his true best friend. The New York morning sun rises and Harry slowly slips into death, creating the saddest ending of any comic book movie. Shockingly, I had a few tears roll down my cheek as peace unraveled on screen. What can I say? Beautiful. Just beautiful.    Overall, at this point, I'd have to put Spider-Man 3 on just about same level as the second one however if not a little lower. The worst aspects of the movie in this film were really prominent in this time around. As to how it compares to the rest of the series and whether it really deserves a 4/5, I won't be able to make that call until I rewatch Spider-Man 3 once more. But I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.   For everyone else, just go see it!

B000N3SSVM|5.0|One of the most interesting records ever produced. Experimental and haunting.  In a few words: it takes risks. And it succeeds.
B0010V4TZU|3.0|Interesting and very diffrent debut. style is all over the place but it works and keeps me moving, very strong debut, cant wait to see them live.
B0015519VS|4.0|So after reading most of the reviews on here I find most of you have been blindsided by the great Usher. First off I think he should have promoted the living out of this album to let his fans know exactly what he's doing. What I find different in this album is the same difference I found in Mariah's E=MC2. They both basically didn't use Jermaine Dupri as much as they did before. Jermaine wrote 1 or 2 songs vs 4 or 5 on their previous albums, so in a way these 2 albums lacked the usual flow because JD isn't heavily involved. Some people were expecting a club bound album not realizing that Usher normally has 2 or 3 club songs(yes I researched and counted) on most of his albums, the rest were all ballads. The message in these ballads is also another thing that threw everyone off. His use of known hit makers like Stargate(Neyo, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Trey Songs, Mariah, etc), Brian M. Cox(mary j. Blige, Joe, Chris Brown, Sammy, Trey Songs etc, Palow Da Don(chris brown, mario), William(BEP, Fergie, JT, Chris Brown etc) ruined the usual flow and the usher feel. All these songs are pretty good but just lack the flow you would expect from a 5th album with a lot hype in front of it. This album will need heavy marketing for it to convince and change all the usher fans who were expecting a playa album and not a Daddy album(if they haven't bought the album yet). All in all I expected the change and I like the album hence the 4 stars. My favourite songs are 'Something Special', 'Before I met You', 'His Mistakes' and 'Love In The Club part 2' minus Lil' Wayne ofcourse . Everyone keep listening and grown with Usher and you'll end up liking the album because he's never going back to his old self for sure unless he gets desperate for sales.

0307237702|5.0|Barck Obama is a self described hopemongerer ( I think we need to add this word to the dictionary if it is not already there given the publicity it has gotten!). In this book he gives practical advice on what an individual can do to make a difference. I found the chapter 4 on politics particularly interesting. He openly talks about campaign financing and how expensive it is in the Illinois media market (and by extension rest of the country) and how it is almost impossible to run a campaign unless you have deep pockets. He talks about the cold calls he had to make to raise funds and the disappointments one goes through in the process. As you read this you realize nothing is easy in this world, even great people like Barack Obama had disappointments, doubts, insecurity..not that infallible after all and that is kind of reassuring in the sense that disappointments are a natural process of getting ahead, we are not alone in this. What also struck me was the openness with which he writes about fund-raising, he brings out the contradiction of the current political system pretty clearly. On one hand you have to represent the poor and the middle class to get their votes and on the other hand if you do not accept contributions form the rich people like law firm partners, investment bankers, hedge fund managers, you are not going to go anywhere in the campaign. He says the more senior the senator is, chances are even more that he is deeply connected with rich people to finance their perpetual campaigns. A reality in present day America, so \\"matter-of-factly\\" written by Barack! I love this book, but particularly liked chapter 4. Read this book if you want to get some insights into this phenomenon which is called Barack Obama!
B00000AFHM|5.0|not believing they could top their 2nd record, they did and made an album that changed me in so many ways i still havent figured them all out yet 10 years later.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|While I do believe that the 1939 adaptation of L. Frank Baum's \\"Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" is a classic that shouldn't be messed with, I prefer \\"Return to Oz\\" because of its more faithful approach to Baum's work. Plus, it's much darker and more intense (the Wheelers will certainly scare the little ones), and Dorothy is indeed played by a young girl, and not a 17-year old Judy Garland (I mean no offense; she was a talented actress indeed, but Fairuza Balk is more believeable here). The special effects are spectacular, and Princess Mombi and her many heads are visually stunning.<br /><br />So be careful, this will not be as sweet and innocent as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and the kids will probably be frightened by the many dark elements in the film (such as Dorothy's electro-shock therapy and the Tin Man's frozen posture).<br /><br />A+

This film shows how Mother Nature will stay the way it is, and how human society will transform into a worse shape than today's. It was made in 1983, but its message is still powerful 25 years later.

B00007FOMP|5.0|Is Marvin Gaye's masterpiece, What's Going On, outdated?<br /><br />Listen...<br /><br />War, crime, poverty, drugs, inflation, taxation, ecological disasters. These are some of the social and political issues that Marvin Gaye addresses on his brilliant 1971 album, What's Going On.<br /><br />And in 2008?<br /><br />Take a look around. These same issues are (still) What's Going On.<br /><br />This album couldn't be any more direct in identifying the world's most urgent problems, or in suggesting that the world slow down and take a spiritual and peaceful approach to solving them.<br /><br />Outdated? No.<br /><br />A masterpiece? Yes.<br /><br />The atmospheric, funky and smooth soul music is powerfully emotional, and perfectly highlights the thought provoking themes. Jazzy saxophones, flutes, congas and funky bass lines accompany Gaye's soulful piano and heartfelt vocal expressions. The sweet Motown orchestration brings it all together beautifully.<br /><br />Every song has a social conscience, and each one addresses one or more of the planet's important issues, then and now.<br /><br />What's Going On:<br />Mother, mother<br />There's too many of you crying<br />Brother, brother, brother<br />There's far too many of you dying<br /><br />What's Happening Brother:<br />Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend<br />Money is tighter than it's ever been<br /><br />Save The Children:<br />I just want to ask a question<br />Who really cares?<br />To save a world in despair<br />Who really cares?<br /><br />Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology):<br />Oh mercy mercy me<br />Ah, things ain't what they used to be<br />What about this overcrowded land<br />How much more abuse from man can she stand?<br /><br />Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler):<br />Rockets, moon shots<br />Spend it on the have nots<br />Money, we make it<br />'Fore we see it, you take it<br /><br />What's Going On is simply a brilliant and satisfying album. It couldn't be any better. The music is great, it's socially and politically relevant, and even as it tackles difficult issues, it's message is spiritually uplifting and positive. There are no romantic love songs here. They'll be on the next album. This isn't a sweeping epic, either, and more power to it for not being one. That would overwhelm Marvin's message. This is music for the people. For God's Children.<br /><br />What's Going On.e next album. This isn't a sweeping epic, either, and more power to it for not being one.

B00005JL0I|5.0|If you are expecting this to be a simple spy vs spy plot, forget about it. Oh yes, it has spies galore, but this hilarious sendup of all things \\"Spy\\" must have inspired comedic authors galore. Every time I watch it I catch another sly pun or comment that cracks me up. This movie is very clever and every actor is hilarious in this all-star cast, from David Niven (as the Original, retired James Bond) to his wily and troublesome nephew, Jimmy Bond, played to perfection by Woody Allen. Deborah Kerr plays Mimi, villainess turned nun for her love of Sir James. (\\"Doodle me, Jamey!\\") Peter Sellers has fun with many costume changes but does not play the bumbler; rather, he is an expert in Bacarat standing in for 007 to help beat one of the bad guys (played hilariously by Orson Wells) and assisted by the fabulously beaded and feathered Ursula Andress!<br />The sets are those of dreams and nightmares, with plenty of the mod patterns of the 60's when this movie was produced. If you love off the wall comedy, this one is a keeper. But watch it closely; the jokes range from subtle and dry to outright silly puns and the confusion created is deliberate and fun. Watch for cameos by Peter O'Toole, Humphrey Bogart and many more.
0679746048|4.0|A great read! \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" is not one of those wildly popular memoirs on mental illness in which the author exposes his/her most intimate feelings and sufferings. I think a lot of the people who reviewed this book and disliked it were expecting a heart-breaking memoir on how a person feels when she's \\"insane\\". Instead, I got the impression that the author was poking fun at the ridiculousness of some of the procedures in the Mental Health field, how a lot of people were (and still are) diagnosed with  a mental illness more readily if they were women, and how psychiatric hospitals are so very regimented that they stop making sense. Susanna Kaysen criticizes a growing obsession with sanity and insanity, in a nation where pills are giving freely and \\"defects of character\\" are quickly diagnosed as \\"personality disorders\\".
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Spectacular.  Profoundly memorable, and deeply memory inspiring.  Fundamental art in music and motion, combining with dance and words, to create an upbeat and thoroughly entertaining way to spend an evening.  Eclectically electric.  Wear a safety helmet if you are over 70, because you are going to get up and dance.  Positive and strong even in the midst of several dismal realities of the 60s-70s.
0143038419|4.0|So many of these reviews have been missing the forest for the trees.  Ms.Gilbert is excellent at doing exactly what she has promised to do: describe HER story of her travels over the course of the year. I personally found the story a wonderful read, with excellent, rich descriptions of her experience. Yes, at points, I found her narrative to be a bit too self-involved, but getting past those points, I did thoroughly enjoy the rest of her story.  I definitely reccommend it to anyone who can focus on the story she shares, not what they expect the book to provide.

O'Brian is a master storyteller with an unbounded imagination and razor wit.  The action is fast paced, and his characters are richly drawn, compelling, amusing, heroic and flawed.  O'Brian is 20th century Charles Dickens.

0385340567|2.0|Lee Child's last book, Bad Luck and Trouble, was a true masterpiece, and having read all of his books, it was clear to me that his work was getting better and better with each addition.  Well, I have to say that this book did not follow the trend.  The plot was boring, something of a mix of Killing Floor and Echo Burning, and Reacher's uniqueness and charm didn't come through.  It was like this book was slapped together, or written by somebody else.  Also, while I don't always agree with Reacher's tactics, what he does at the end of this book is deplorable.
B000PFUA9G|3.0|I love Brad Paisley but didn't enjoy 5th Gear as much as I thought I would. I couldn't wait for the cd's release although I didn't enjoy the single \\"Ticks.\\" I also did not like the single \\"Online\\" although I love \\"Letter to Me.\\" I guess that's the problem with this album; its very hit or miss and I was expecting more from the lyrical content. I enjoy every other song it seems like and thus, I see this album as being average. While Brad's vocie is great to listen to, I need more than that and don't think this album stands up to \\"Time Well Wasted\\" or \\"Mud on the Tires.\\"
B0014DBZT2|4.0|At first listen, I was not certain I would care for this album; although I am a dedicated Cave fan.  After one or two times playing it, I really liked Midnight Man and More News from Nowhere.  I am finding I like the whole album better and better the more I listen to it, reminding me that Cave's work grows on you. I think Dig Lazarus Dig is a good choice for Cave's fans. The man is amazing and just gets better as time passes.
0316067601|5.0|As a former Navy Corpsman from the 60s, and have friends that are Seals, I have great respect for what they do.  They rarely talk about their training and what they went through to get there.  After reading this book, and being moved to tears, my level of respect for these men is indescribeable. Thank God for men like Mr. Luttrell and his team, this country owes them more than it can or will ever repay.  This book perfectly shows what the words \\"Duty - Honor- Country \\" stands for.
0385340567|3.0|I've read all the Jack Reacher stories and was looking forward to reading this one.  I bought it and read it and should have waited for my library to get it.  As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, some readers might be annoyed at Lee Child's politics  revealing itself in Jack Reacher.  That did annoy me.  The different plots seamed to be reaching a bit (sorry).  I was ready the throw the book down when  it referred to an Army Lt. as a \\"one-striper.\\"  Let's hope, but not despair,(that was fun) Lee Child will bring his magic back with his next  book.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Rock music does a lot of things extremely well, but one emotion that it seems to have difficulty capturing is despair.  I'm not talking about the blues.  The blues involves reveling, often in a kind of self-satisfied way, about one's awareness of how badly one's life is going.  There's nothing smug or self-satisfied about despair: it is a prelude to the death of hope, the reaching of a point from which one can't \\"come back.\\"  \\"Amnesiac\\" captures despair better than just about any rock album I can think of (another great entry in this abject sweeptakes would be Fleetwood Mac's masterpiece \\"Then Play On\\").<br /><br />\\"Amnesiac\\" is to most music dealing with misery as opening up a bottle of whiskey in a darkened room with a loaded gun on the table, alone and with the phone disconnected, is to a bragging drunkalogue delivered to a crowded AA meeting.  If you don't understand what I'm talking about consider yourself fortunate.  If you do, get \\"Amnesiac.\\"  It does perfectly what it sets out to do, with no compromises or gratuitous bows to commercial acceptance or normal rock and roll conventions.  It couldn't be the high art that it is if it had been done in any other way.

Buy it,you'll be glad to be able to look at it again. really, it's that good.
B00004VXF2|3.0|This album is unlistenable, but that's the point.  This is really the sort of unrefined experimental new age work that people make today.  And Reed's latest release is proof that he's always had his mind on this sort of thing.  Guitars are under-rated, yet extremely over-rated instruments; many things can be done with them, and too many people use them in all the same manner.  Reed is one individual who doesn't take the instrument for granted, and this is proof.  I personally would've liked the record better though if it did have more to it; most of what you hear in the first few minutes is just about all you hear the rest of way.

B000OVLBEO|3.0|The only critique I'd have for this version of the film is that they should've had a way to turn the extended features on and off. A way to play the original theatrical cut of the movie, because the extras are great, but if you've seen the original you are almost painfully aware of where the new content is while watching the film and it gets a little distracting. The widescreen format doesn't bother me as much but that's also one of those little things that get to you if you're buying this version for it's features.

B000PY52EU|5.0|I saw a picture of Ricci kneeling on the grass with only scanty pants on in PLAYBOY. The snapshot--a key part of the movie--enticed me to see the<br />movie. I had not read any of the reviews or even dreamed of Sam Jackson's<br />versatility.  So many have reviewed the movie in detail that I will<br />disappoint. Ricci's gutsy performance done with total abandonment and yet also grace has to been seen. Sam Jackson shows his versatility, firmness, tenderness and musical abilities in a role that no one else could play as well. There is a great supporting cast. The music adds to the movie and<br />brings some liveliness into a story that otherwise could have been very<br />cold. Seeing intermingling of races in a southern town is refreshing yet one has to wonder if this could happen in more liberated northern cities.<br />Yes there is some nudity yet it is essential and handled in a delicate<br />artistic manner.  Those who want to drool at Ricci's anatomy will find the film disappointing. Those who appreciate superb acting and a lively moving plot will find Very Few Better.  Atypical and great!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a great movie that wraps up the series FireFly.  Well, it's supposed to.    I love the humor in the midst of an action filled movie.  (my favorite- I swallowed a bug)    The last line of the movie- Excellent.  Love this flick!

B0001XAPZ6|3.0|My best friend of 22 years was one of the first people that began ranting and raving about Studio Ghibli films and around that same time Spirited Away had just won the 2nd Oscar for Best Animated Film in Academy Awards history. Being a fan of the more popular anime shows and movies such as Dragon Ball Z and Akira I knew that these magical films would soon be seen.<br /><br />In 1984 the very first film by this group of talanted animators was born. 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' tells a story of a far off future where a strange toxic jungle is engulfing the entire planet Earth. Through time there were many battles between the insects and surviving human kingdoms trying to keep both worlds far from one another. Then there is the kingdom of the valley of the wind ruled by Princess Nausicaa a fearless and caring girl who had always been able to find the beauty in everything, even the toxic jungle. Suddenly her kingdom is invaded by one of the most ruthless of human kingdoms. Saying they are there to protect her people she along with a cunning young prince find that the humans are hatching a plot that only Nausicaa can prevent.<br /><br />Thanks to Walt Disney Studios, particularly John Lasseter of Pixar these unbeleiveable films are now available in the U.S. for all to enjoy. I was blown away by the creativity of Hiayo Miyazaki's first film and the famous actors they brought it in play the English voices. Unfortunatly I felt that the movie just dragged on a little too much. I don't think this will be a Studio Ghibli film I would own myself. Still, it is a movie that should be seen. You will be amazed at the specticle and grandure of this film and be very anxious to see what else Studio Ghibli has to offer a true film fan.

B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis was always a perfect embodiment of the outlandish, epical art-rock movement of the 70s.  However, there is nothing wrong with being associated with such a tasteful and influential genre.  Since art-rock was mostly a British domain, Genesis let their English nationality shine on most of their early albums but never as brightly as on this album, their fifth studio release, \\"Selling England By The Pound\\".  The very title, an English literary pun, sets up the atmosphere for the album, which is just as British as anything The Who or King Crimson ever did.  Indeed, \\"Selling England By The Pound\\", is a definitive art-rock album, a colorful combination of British whimsy, epic story telling, and atmospheric textures.    Starting out with Peter Gabriel asking the question, \\"Can you tell me where my country lies?\\", that question is slowly answered throughout the course of the album.  As with their previous albums, there is a balance of humor in such tracks as, \\"I Know What I Like In Your Wardrobe\\", and, \\"The Battle Of Epping Forest, and of full blow epics with such pieces as, \\"Firth Of Fifth\\", and, \\"The Cinema Show\\".  Quite often, facets of everyday English life are presented in epic format, such as the latter track, \\"Cinema Show\\", which combines a simple movie date with Greek Mythology.    Lyrics aside, the music and instrumentation is beyond amazing.  Tony Bank's baroque piano piece at the beginning of, \\"Firth Of Fifth\\" is pure genius and Steve Hackett's guitar solo on, \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" is technical brilliance.  The latter solo uses two handed tapping (later used profoundly by Eddie Van Halen) as well as sweep picking (some ten years before Yngwie Malmsteen would ever use it).  Sweeping mellotron passages and vast textures of 12 string guitar chords add to the distictly epic and whimsical atmosphere present throughout the record.    This is Genesis, most true to their British personas.  Their next album, \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\", would see them reaching their full potential by attempting to \\"Americanize\\" themselves.  Though that would turn out to be their most popular album, it wouldn't have happened if they hadn't perfected their art-rock sound with this album.  For me, Genesis ranks just behind The Who as the most British sounding band that didn't sell out to the blues and teenage rebellion of American rock.  Sure, they were unfairly trampled upon by the punk era, and era that built its reputation on bands who could barely even play their instruments, but as long as the music is here, it doesn't matter what the punks thought.  This is still a landmark recording that should be in every household, British or American.
B000002UAI|3.0|The boys look weary from their success on this album cover. It's their second album for 1964 and it's known for being another rush job. It suffers from the fact that the rapidly growing songwriting talents of John & Paul were stifled in the need to get product out as quickly as possible. For me, the weakest songs on the album are the covers. Even as a kid I was especially bored by \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" and the two Carl Perkins songs though I do like Buddy Holly's \\"Words Of Love\\". Three of the best songs begin the album. Referred to as the \\"Lennon trilogy\\", \\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm A Loser\\" and \\"Baby's In Black\\" are songs that share the darkness in the souls of lovers and show John becoming increasingly self-aware in his lyrical content. Paul's \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" has a lovely and melancholy feel to it. \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" are sweet throwbacks to the love songs the Fabs got famous for in the first place. \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\" is another Lennon song in which the narrator resigns himself to losing love. My favourite song from this album is smack in the middle- \\"Eight Days A Week\\". From it's soaring guitar line to the glorious harmonies to the catchy handclaps between 'Hold me,love me! Hold me,love me!', it's pure pop heaven. Get it for the great original songs.
B00007LTIL|5.0|AMERICAN BEAUTY, the best Grateful Dead album ever, has been improved through warm, thick remastering, as well as the addition of eight bonus cuts. Which is not to say that the original album slacks off in quality either. Such great songs as \\"Truckin'\\", \\"Friend Of The Devil\\", and the best of the lot, \\"Box Of Rain\\", prove that the Dead really did their best work when they stopped trying out unusual sounds and actually got down to writing real songs. This CD is truly the version of AMERICAN BEAUTY that you should own.
0061537934|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  So imaginatively written from the dog's perspective, I found it funny, poignant, and thoroughly enjoyable.  Highly recommended for dog lovers especially, but I can see anyone with a vivid imagination enjoying this book!
B00064MW6K|1.0|I've seen some bad acting, but I don't think an \\"Oscar Winner\\" should act this badly in a movie. Hallie Berry, who I like as an African American actress, did a horrible job as Catwoman. Really, she was following in the steps of the lovely Michelle Phieffer, Eartha Kitt, etc. These women were sexy as Catwoman and they were vicious. More importantly, they seem to do it effortlessly. You could tell Hallie was struggling to be sexy in this movie when it should have come off naturally.<br /><br />The villain was just all right, nothing special.<br /><br />At least the fight scene at the end was okay. But the premise and acting leaves much to be desired.
0385340567|1.0|I am sorry to say that this one was a major disappointment.  It is an antiwar propaganda leaflet, not an exciting thriller.  Reacher finally takes up arms in the War on Terror, but not in the way you'd expect.      Reacher is called upon to stop a \\"dirty bomb\\" that is about to be detonated in an American city.  The nefarious villain masterminding this terrorist plot is not a Al Qaeda extremist, but -- of course -- a fundamentalist Christian businessman who is trying to bring about events foretold in the Book of Revelation.  The bomb is made of depleted Uranium from salvaged American tank armor, and Reacher gives one of the other characters a detailed briefing on the grave dangers posed by highly toxic depleted Uranium munitions -- a briefing that would do a MOVEON activist proud.      We learn that Reacher is against the war in Iraq when he refuses to expose a network of deserters being smuggled to Canada, stating that he has great sympathy for the deserters and that what they do takes \\"even more courage\\" than remaining in combat.  His love interest in the book is a wife of an American soldier who has been turned into a vegetable by a brain injury. Reacher and the wife go to visit this wounded veteran, and we learn that they can actually see his brain protruding from the side of his head. Naturally, the conditions in his long-term care facility are appalling; the rooms are filthy, there are mice everywhere, and the staff is surly and unfeeling.    I am a flag-waiving conservative who supports the war in Iraq.  However, I do have an open mind.  I recognize that many who oppose the war do so in good faith.  Moreover, I am not looking for a book that reinforces my own prejudices.  And even if I were, I can certainly be entertained by a book even though I might disagree with its message.      But this isn't a book -- it's a ham-fisted piece of left-wing propaganda.  The plot is like something dreamed up by a bunch of European college students upon their return from an anti-globalization protest.  Every cheesy left-wing cliche imaginable was used in the book, and it is simply awful.  At the end you are left wondering when Reacher will sign up for human shield duty in Iraq, it's that bad.
0634089358|5.0|I got some other more sophisticated (I.e. Jazz)  bass book by Mr. Friedland, and I didn't like it at all, probably because I don't like Jazz, since it came after the blues form. This blues bass book is just fine for my rudimentary bass learning needs. Good front cover photo of a bass I would buy in a second if you could get one new made U.S.A.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Writing a review for something that I loved as much as I loved \\"My So-Called Life\\" is so much more difficult than writing a negative review.  Unlike flaws, the stuff that makes up the fabric of a great television shows aren't as easy to point out.  Good writing, good direction, good acting, good lighting, and everything else that goes into a television show, if well done, blends together in a very organic way and, instead of standing out, contributes to the overall effect of the show.  Such in the case with \\"My So-Called Life,\\" which makes this gem of a show so much harder to review.    If I had to pick out what was best about this show, I guess I'd say how downplayed and true to life the writing is.  There are no huge revelations, no earth-shaking events... just life, as seen through the eyes of Angela Chase (played by Claire Danes, who is a force of nature).  Her relationship with her friends evolves erratically throughout the series, as does everyone's view of her.  Nothing is static from episode to episode, and the resolution made in the end of Episode 6 might be completely reversed in Episode 7.  Another great part about this show is that none of the characters are just fodder.  Each of them (even some of the recurring characters) seem to have an equal share of the \\"My So-Called Life\\" pie.    Speaking of which, I thought it was so admirable that creator Winnie Holzman made the parents such complex characters and gave them so much screen time.  Heck, there were even episodes where I thought Pattie and Graham Chase got more screen time than Angela.  Even some of the best teen oriented shows had the parents reduced to either moral-support figures or foils for the teen protagonist, but Angela's parents were so much more.  Like all of Holzman's characters, they were intensely flawed yet sympathetic characters that interacted wonderfully with the cast.    The presentation of the show is unrivaled as far as TV on DVD goes.  Many episodes have commentary, the menus arequirky and reflect the mood of the show (and are backed with great music), and there is an entire bonus disc filled with insightful special features that have interviews and features on all the lead actors as well as the creator, Winnie Holzman.  There is a companion book with the DVD that features an episode guide and some essays, notably one from [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy/]][[ASIN:B000TLTCU4 Angel/]][[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly]] creator Joss Whedon.  The box that holds the DVDs looks and feels like a big, thick book, much like what the series itself felt like when I was taking it in.    The attention to subtlety and detail of \\"My So-Called Life,\\" both in the show itself and the presentation, is what made the show so great.  There are no big swooping gestures, no [[ASIN:B000WGYMW4 contrived]] [[ASIN:B000W6ZUUC beautiful-people]] [[ASIN:B0002V7TZQ drama]], just a truly poignant, true-to-life story about a young girl. Highlights of this criminally short series are \\"So-Called Angels\\" (the tear-jerking Christmas episode), \\"Life of Brian,\\" and the series finale, though--as Joss Whedon pointed out in his essay--it would be silly to try to point out the best part of \\"My So-Called Life,\\" because I would just start describing each episode.  And you might as well just watch the series.  Because you won't regret it.    9/10
B000UX6THK|5.0|I enjoyed this series when it first ran in the 90's, and thoroughly enjoyed watching this series in a more continuous sitting over the span of several days, like reading a novel in video form.  I also enjoyed the additional material, interviews of David Lynch and actors, etc. on the final disc.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B00065MDSQ Red 30th Anniversary Edition Remastered]] Red is one of my favorite all-time albums, and I was hoping that the remaster would really bring out something I hadn't heard. But turns out, the original CD version was pretty darn close to the remaster, so it's not a night 'n' day comparison.<br /><br />By contrast, the remaster of Pink Floyd's first two albums was unbelievable, as if the music had just been recorded yesterday. The Red remaster is slightly brighter, but the flat muddiness and high compression of the first track is still there, and I was hoping the remaster would open it up a bit more. Still my favorite track, though.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Very good collection.  We watched the series on TV and it's even better in BluRay.
B000005RTD|5.0|There are no words to describe what a heavy metal milestone this album represents. I got the two pack Wheels of steel/strong arm of the law and Steel is so astoundingly terrific it defies description. Every song is a winner especially Motorcycle man (the lead guitar solo loosens dental fillings) and Wheels of steel has a cat scratch fever feel to it but is an instant classic of metal. Quit reading this and start playing the cd. WOW!!! Metal music to last a lifetime.
B00001MXXH|4.0|I've loved it since I first saw it in a hotel room. Ironically,I was quite sick at that time.<br />Ferris Buller has the day off, claiming he is ill, using his wits. Decade, or year doesn't mater because there will forever be those kids who would love a day on the run with no classes! Kids can easily relate, and if not there has to be something very wrong! No, I KID, REALLY!<br />There's a lot of goodness in here, and the brother sister jealousy is spot on.<br />Great fun, and laughs for everyone!
B0000542D2|5.0|Two words best describe The Beatles' first film A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, funny and quirky.  Director Richard Lester shows the mayhem of 1964 that was Beatlemania - adolescent teens screaming at the top of their lungs for the four Liverpudlians, who in turn, are running for cover.  The film is a quick jaunt through the day in a life of the British rock band's daily schedule, which involved a set of rehearsals for a television variety show, somewhat annoying press interviews, but a stunning finale filled with \\"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\"<br /><br />But the boys go on brief excursions of their own in between takes to break the monotony.  From singing \\"I Should Have known Better\\" in the train's storage coach, a little dancing at the hotel casino to several Beatle tunes, \\"I Wanna Be Your Man,\\" \\"Don't Bother Me,\\" and \\"All My Loving,\\" romping around in an open field to the tune of \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" to Ringo venturing out on his own with \\"Ringo's Theme\\" (\\"This Boy\\" instrumental) playing in the background, the film is filled with madcap humor reminiscent of the Marx Brothers but with a tinge of British comedy; one of the highlights of the film besides the music is the highly humorous screenplay by Allun Owen that the lads and the supporting cast, Paul's Grandfather played by Wilfred Brambell, the television director (Victor Spinetti), Norm, the manager (Norman Rossington), Shake, the assistant (John Junkin II), bring to life.<br /><br />A HARD DAY'S NIGHT remains to be a timeless classic.  The film was innovative during the time it was made and still influences those who watch it over and over again.  But most of all it captures the innocence of that period.  Indeed, it is a film that many Beatles fan cannot help to watch more than once because of its of top notch production and performances by one of the greatest bands in rock and roll history.
B000RZGIQ8|4.0|Top Gun is the kind of movie that can really benefit from hi-def treatment, with thrilling fighter jet acrobatics and vast shots of earth, sea, sky, and much smaller but still big enough things like aircraft carriers.  The filmmakers took great care to achieve realism in some of its technical aspects while letting the plot fly high in typical Hollywood manner.  The result is not only a solid mainstream blockbuster, but even for many who flinch at its implausibilities and plot cliches it qualifies as a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is \\"Maverick,\\" a hot shot Navy fighter pilot with attitude, haunted by the mysterious fate of his father, a Navy pilot shot down over Southeast Asia.  Called up to the elite \\"Top Gun\\" Navy fighter pilots school, Maverick displays both his outstanding flying prowess and his character flaws, pulling off brave and foolhardy stunts (that would end the career of real fighter pilots), failing to be a team player, and wooing a beautiful woman (Kelly McGillis) who turns out to be one of his instructors.  Then a tragic event causes him to lose his nerve.  About to give up, and losing the girl, he learns the true fate of his father.  Will he live up to his father's example or wash out?<br /><br />Not everyone likes Tom Cruise (I think he's always been a fine actor), but even his detractors ought to admit he was well suited to this role, easily projecting an attractive but immature cockiness.  The flight scenes are great fun, done to popular 80s rock that, with more romantic tunes like \\"Take My Breath Away,\\" made the soundtrack a top seller.  The plot cliches are cliches because they usually work, and they're effectively enough played out here.<br /><br />The new Top Gun Blu-ray Special Collector's Edition will be full of special features from the 2004 2-disc standard definition Special Collector's Edition:<br /><br />-- audio commentary by producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Tony Scott, screenwriter Jack Epps Jr., and Top Gun veterans Captain Mike Galpin (also flew for the movie), retired Admiral Pete Pettigrew and Vice Admiral Mike McCabe<br />-- Danger Zone: The Making Of Top Gun:<br />. . . \\"From The Ground Up--Pre-Production\\" (30 minutes)<br />. . . \\"Playing With The Boys--Production: Land And Seas\\" (27 minutes)<br />. . . \\"The Need For Speed--Production: Air\\" (28 minutes)<br />. . . \\"Back To Basics--Visual Effects\\" (17 minutes)<br />. . . \\"Combat Rock--The Music Of Top Gun (21 minutes)<br />. . . \\"Afterburn--Release and Impact\\" (24 minutes)<br />-- Best of the Best: Inside the Real Top Gun (28 minutes)<br />-- Behind the Scenes featurette (5 minutes)<br />-- Survival Training featurette (7 minutes)<br />-- Tom Cruise interviews (7 minutes)<br />-- multi-angle storyboards with optional commentary by director Tony Scott (2 scenes)<br />-- music videos:<br />. . .

The sound will be English Dolby TrueHD 5.1, English DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, and optional subtitles in English, English for the deaf and hard of hearing, French, Spanish, or Portuguese.<br /><br />This movie was already released in HD at 1080p, so we should expect the new Blu-ray to be at least as good as that release.  The video for the HD was generally praised, especially in comparison to the standard DVD, with new sharpness and detail, better and more saturated though not spectacular color, minor grain in some shots that was due to the original film grain, and some minor dust specs.  The sound was also generally well received for a movie of its age, with lots of rear speaker activity and booming bass.<br /><br />Looks like this should be a fine DVD, if you like the movie.ie.
B00005JL78|5.0|Sci-fi crime thriller set in the year 2054 about a policeman - played by Tom Cruise - who works in the Department of Precime in Washington D.C. which uses people with the gift of precognition to prevent murders before they happen. But one day the precognitives predict that Tom Cruise himself will commit a murder; a prediction that leads to Tom Cruise going on the run to clear his name and in the process uncovering a murder that happened in the past; one that somehow the Department of Precrime didn't know about. I found this to be a quite excellent film, with an intelligent plot, first-rate protagonist played by Tom Cruise and a wonderfully realised future world (the special effects really are something else). Spielberg is as usual in his element when making science fiction and this film is even better than the outstanding `A.I. Artificial Intelligence' which he made the year before. A flawless combination of exceptional story telling and science fiction vision that is quite simply film-making at its very best. A modern classic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a great series, i was really bummed when they cancelled it but glad when Cerenity came out. I got a copy Firefly at Freddys for only $19.99!(it goes on sale all the time buy it there!)
B0000009RT|4.0|Frank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention-Freak Out! ****<br /><br />Well...um...I was pretty disappointed by Freak Out! when I first heard it, so I thought this can't be right, this is nothing like everyone described it, and so I gave it a couple more listens and still nothing. So I set it aside for a while and when I finally went back to it I still felt the same way.<br /><br />One thing is for sure it is really one of the most original rock albums of all time, not that all of Zappa's releases aren't but this one especially. It is bizarre but not in the bizarre that I thought it would be and it is nothing like any of his other releases. The musicianship is nowhere near the level that everyone describes it as. 'I'm Not Satisfied' has some great piano work, and 'Trouble Every Day' has some great early garage rock guitar, and was really a sign of things to come.<br /><br />Zappa's humour in his lyrics here is great however, and actually some of the best of his career, and he clearly had his vocals down patent since phase one. But what I found most impressive about Freak Out! is that it is nothing like the hippie movement as the title implies, in fact it is almost anti that, and that is what is so brilliant, not the musicianship, but the social commentary of the time. The impressionistic ways of the youth in America and how they are so susceptible to things and how it is wrong of the capitalist ways to take advantage.<br /><br />'Trouble Every Day' is fantastic, the doo-whop feel of most of the album while a tribute, Zappa makes it uniquely his own, and 'Help, I'm A Rock' is also among his all time best, so while this isn't quite the album I was hoping for but it is still a legendary effort, I mean it did inspire Srg. Pepper, so there you go!
B00004XPPE|5.0|But perhaps the machines we have built to protect us.     \\"Fail Safe\\" was filmed in 1964 at the height of the Cold War nuclear anxiety. The premise is that our US technology mistakenly labeled a troubled passenger aircraft as an incoming Soviet bomb and scrambled our own Air Force fighters against Moscow.  President (Henry Fonda) and the Soviet Premier must work together to try and diffuse the situation and ultimately to solve the problems our failed 'fail safe' system created.     I am aware this film was redone in color and I am not sure it could ever be as good.  The starkness of the black and white adds to the drama and period authenticity of the situation.  Plus, Henry Fonda is in my opinion one of the best US Presidents on screen.  This film is a classic and well worth the cost of the disc to add to your collection if you are a political science or a war buff.     Rebecca Kyle, June 2008
0316143472|5.0|My brother in law introduced me to David Sedaris a while back on an audio tape, and I must say this book was just as enjoyable.  The origins of the title was just so interesting.  And it was a pleasure to see him on \\"The Daily Show\\" as well.  Just all around fun stuff!
B0000025T6|5.0|If you painted pictures from these songs, they'd be in starkest black and white with splashes of red. The music itself is stark--just Bruce singing with his guitar and a harmonica howling sharp.     The title track is probably one of the scariest songs I have ever heard.  The opening lyrics will make your hair stand up on end:    \\"I  saw her standin' on her front lawn just twirlin' her baton  Me and her went for a ride sir and ten innocent people died\\"    If Bruce isn't talking killers, he's talking cops.  In \\"Highway Patrolman\\", Sgt Joe Roberts has got to put up with family trouble:    \\"Now ever since we was young kids it's been the same come down  I get a call over the radio Franky's in trouble downtown  Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away  But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way...\\"    There's poor kids watching how the rich live in \\"Mansion on the Hill,\\" driving in the dark in \\"Open all Night,\\" and a whole lot more.  It's harsh, but in some cases hopeful.  This is definitely not a party album or one you would listen to if you were needing to be cheered up, but the storytelling's some of the most solid around.      Rebecca Kyle, June 2008

Asi que tuve toda la coleccíon desde la época, primero en BETA, luego en VHS, y ahora, finalmente, en DVD! de hecho las compre para mi cumpleaños.    Quede muy contento con este pack, la imagén, el sonido, excelentes! lo único que critico es que, primero no tienen subtitulos en español, también me deja un poco triste que \\"Dream Child\\" esta cortada! es la versión censurada, toda la vida, desde que la tenía en Beta, siempre la ví sin censura, asi que quede un poco mal por esto.    Pero en General bien, claro que me hubiera gustado ver grabaciones originales de los detrás de cámaras de la época.
B0018CNNTY|4.0|No one talked in films and they were in black and white.  Stuntmen were in their infancy.  Roy (Lee Pace) sustains an injury in a fall and requires hospitalization.  His girlfriend moves on to another man.  He's so depressed he wants to die.     Along comes a little Hispanic girl Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) with a broken arm.  She's all over the hospital, throwing oranges at the priest and stealing the Eucharist as a snack.  When she arrives at Roy's bedside, he begins to tell her the story of five heroes who set out to destroy Governor Odious...    As the story progresses, we learn of the destruction of Alexandria's family home and Roy's confidence in himself.  Together, these two misfits work to rebuild a different reality from the fantasy stories they are telling.     \\"The Fall\\" is a beautifully filmed movie.  Both Pace and Miss Untaru are engaging and frankly make magic happen on the screen whenever they are together.  Part of this tale is on the level of \\"The Princess Bride\\" which is one of my favorite films ever.  For me, it didn't quite make it, but was still an afternoon well spent away from the heat.  While the basic story is good, some mature themes make \\"The Fall\\" unsuitable for really young audiences.     Rebecca Kyle, June 2008

0802130208|5.0|What a book, what a masterpiece! A comedy, the likes of which I've never read, with characters so unbelievable real I had to occasional take breaks from reading it.<br /><br />The prose surprised me again and again with such beauty, wit and genius. From the first page, I was held in thrall to Toole's talent: \\"Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.\\"<br /><br />The everyday mundane, sometimes disgusting, bits of the lives of these people combined with Toole's writing is just incredible. It makes for such an unforgettable experience.<br /><br />Toole has his some of characters talk his local dialect, which in many books, is so confusing, so difficult to read or to decipher. He makes it work. No, not work, he makes it seamless, perfect, brilliant. I'm not reading their words--I can hear them talking. It's beautiful.<br /><br />The story centers around Ignatius J. Reilly, as does everything if he can make it, an overweight, over-educated, overly demanding man living with his Mamma, holed up in his bedroom, drinking Dr. Nut and scribbling about Medieval history and the problems of today. This has gone on for many years, and would continue for many more except for a family emergency which pushes his Mamma to take the unusual step of standing up to Ignatius and telling him he must get a job. His world is shaken, he is spiraling out of control, Fortuna has spun against him.<br /><br />And thus, with much GI troubles and vitriolic ranting and railing against peoples in general and particular, Ignatius goes out into the world for the second time since college. The omnipotent reader is privy to both the actual facts and often, Ignatius's more flattering description of events as he writes about it later, with the view of future publication, in a Big Chief tablet in his room.<br /><br />There were times I didn't laugh, though, but that was when I saw myself in this gargantuan idealistic slob, this over-educated moron trying to impose his world views on all around him. That's when, instead of laughing, I gave an inwardly embarrassed chuckle and moved on quickly.<br /><br />There's an underlying element of sadness to the novel, to me anyway. Is it knowing this is Toole's only novel and there'll be nothing else to read? Is it knowing that he committed suicide, and feeling that sadness seep into the pages? Or is it simply knowing that Ignatius is destined to bumble every attempt at every thing merely because Fortuna has it out for his overwhelming conceit? I think it's a mix of all three, and this melancholy tempers the outright hilarity, balancing it, making it even more thought-provoking.<br /><br />Other residents of New Orleans find their paths crossed with Ignatius, usually to their dismay, and always find their lives changed in some way as a result.

B00009MGGI|3.0|Charming movies but plot leans to transparent, very little political knowledge is not needed and the films can hardly could be called deep. Entertaining though, but not really a very thinking thriller, as some might've supposed. Acting is somewhat average, with the plot and acting best viewed with a sense of belief. Not a humourous film directly but charming, amusing, bit of a black comedy kind of thriller. Worth a watch, but not to be expect something of a mind strectcher.
0525950079|5.0|World Without End exceeded my expectations. The story takes place two centuries after its predecessor, Pillars of the Earth. The location is the same, the village of Kingsbridge, in England. Mr. Follet has created marvelous, believable characters to carry his story of building bridges, romances, serfdom, and the horror of the Plague. Like Pillars of the Earth, I was again sorry to finally read the last pages of this remarkable book.
B00125WAXC|5.0|As usual, Denzel Washington is outstanding in this film. Likewise, so is   Forest Whitiker and the new cast of youngsters,(particularly Denzel Whitiker). A Harpo film produced by Oprah in 2007 was in my opinion one of the best films made last year. The film is loosely based on a true story,about Wiley College's black debate coach Melvin Tolson(Denzel Washington). Plot takes place at historically black Wiley College and is set in the south during the Harlem Renissance in the 1930s. It is a heartwarming and inspirational film that reminds young and old about the impact of Jim Crow laws and how common lynch mobs were a pervasive fear  for blacks. This was the first film to feature two African Americans who had previously won the Academy Award for Best Actor (Denzel Washington for Training Day and Forest Whitiker for The Last King of Scotland).                                      This film reminds a people that\\"yes we can\\" overcome our obstacles    and challenges against all odds.
B0012GVKW8|4.0|What can I say?  I saw it for the first time in a theater when I was 13 years old.  I loved this movie so much then, that the following week I was at the same theater to see \\"The Untouchables\\", but I left that show to go watch \\"Predator\\" again.    The quality of the video is not great, because of the grainy film.  Despite that, I believe anyone watching this on a 720P (or higher) HDTV will find this experience reminiscent of the theater experience from the late 1980s.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|very bad movie, very disappointing ......I almost fall asleep to it.....just another soft porn with no taste or good story....I am disappointment in Quentin Tarrentino's taste......I loved Kill Bill was very good if you like to see a lot of blood.....but this doesn't has a story that is interesting enough to be made into a film...plus nothing interesting at all happens until the last 25 min. of the movie....so boring, so slow....this is the last Quentin Tarrentino film I will pay money for to see...he obviously has lost his talent.
B000A6T262|5.0|I love Star Trek, I'm a great fan! I always wanted to buy this set... and I finally did. The DVD's content is awesome! Lots of extras!<br /><br />Some Cons... Only 4 DVDs are stamped with images, the rest of them are painted in grey/silver. I would like the box to be more resistant, made in a harder material, but it's ok, and it looks great. Also would be nice some booklets, or inlays... the doble sized dvd boxes doesn't make any sense. Because the two DVDs are located on the same side.<br /><br />Overall, the packaging could be better, but the DVDs are simply great. A must have!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Perhaps the most boring beginning of any film ever made. It took fifteen minutes before something mildly intersting happened. I disliked all of the major characters, and since there is no story line per se, without characterization there is nothing left but some not-very well-done Special Effects.<br />  Basically, this is the sort of movie that a film student makes in their second year as an experiment.  Then when all of their classmates, and professors, laugh at it, they learn to start telling an interesting story, and move on, wiser and more mature.<br />  Cloverfield offers the viewer nothing at all.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|just saw this movie and is unquestionably the best indy movie since raiders of the lost ark, full of great set pieces and action and its  A INDIANA JONES MOVIE.  these folks out there that are complaining would not know a good movie if it bit them on the #*#.  its an old fashioned rollicking adventure of the highest order.  yes its has some elements of sci fi...but folks this was the fifties....with the atomic age....men from mars ...the barnacle reds :) so its absolutely time appropriate material, its all high movie making magic at its best.  harrison has never been better and so is the rest of the cast....shia could be in line ...possably to take over...?? spielberg and lucas have outdone themselfs...and as always the american public is showing that by its fantastic rule at the box office......the rules of majority ...as....they....say rule.    its a superb movie that anyone that would love and  great time at the movies like we used too ...this is it.     5 STARS.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|I really enjoyed this film and enjoyed re-watching it with the commentary by Professor Brian Cox, the scientific consultant for the movie.    Those reviewers who are stating that the science is poor (or even \\"ridiculous\\") may not have listened to this commentary.  There are some errors, which Cox points out, but the overall idea is not impossible, or even so farfetched as to be 'virtually impossible'.      Professor Cox is a Royal Society University Research Fellow in Particle Physics at the University of Manchester who also works on the ATLAS experiment at CERN in Geneva.  In his commentary he mentions discussing with other scientists at CERN about the Q-ball hypotheses and relevance to sun-dying and restarting in the movie.  (Incidentally, he seems to believe the existence these super-symetrical (or super-stable) objects will be proven (by CERN) within the next 10 years or so.)  His problems with science in the movie tend to be some of the smaller issues (for example - the craft orbiting Mercury a few times, rather than just a 'sling-shot' use).    His statement on what the penultimate scene means to him (even if it only occurs in a 'billionth of a second', or in 'the mind') is wonderful, and really impressed upon me the beauty, wonder, and awe many scientists hold for the universe.  I think some reviewers only saw this scene in a  literal earth-based perception of time and were put-off by it.  Again, it's not necessarily meant to be seen that way.  (And as mentioned earlier, Professor Cox's comment on its magnificence is inspiring.)    Another criticism reviewers have mentioned was why so many unstable people were picked for these missions.  Again, I think these reviewers may have missed something covered briefly in the film itself, and then more in depth in the commentaries.  The people picked were stable and generally the very best in their field.  Something with gravity, radiation, or another undefined characteristic of the sun caused mental problems . . . this was the reason the second mission included a psychologist, and the reason he was experimenting with the impact of sunlight exposure.  I also think the writer was using individuals to highlight various aspects of human nature, but that might just be me.      All that being said, this is not a Star Wars type of film.  If that is what you are looking for, you may well be disappointed.  On the other hand, it is a bit less obscure in meaning and plot than films like Solaris, and maybe even a bit easier to grasp on the first viewing than 2001, and, for me at least, imparted much of the wonder and awe that those films did.       To anyone choosing to see this film on DVD, I'd recommend watching it, and then watching it again (or at the very least, the last five minutes of it) with Cox's commentary.  In my opinion his comments make a really enjoyable film even better.
1430300612|5.0|I bought this book after watching a short video online of a seminar Jill Bolte-Taylor did based on the experience, and loved her style of communicating, and this book was no different. The science that she shares is very easy to understand and extremely informative. Her writing style is just as effective as her speaking style, she communicates things with passion, which makes the book entertaining and well as informative. I firmly believe this is a Must for anyone who may find themselves caring for a stroke survivor, the do's and dont's she passes along based on her own experience could make all the difference in a stroke survivors' recovery.
1932100660|4.0|Dr Campbell has a general disregard for the medical profession which is somewhat pervasive in his story.  There are several scientific elements missing from the studies, however, he presents in a pretty clear manner a huge scandal in America - Go figure, it's all about money after all!  The study in China is a refreshing look into the reality of living the easy life and the diseases and cancers we bring on ourselves as a result.  Fascinating reading!
B000002L99|4.0|And so, the Sammy Hagar years begin.  After the departure of David Lee Roth the band took some time off and then announced that former Montrose and AOR solo artist Sammy Hagar would be joining the band on lead vocals and guitar.  Personally I always liked Hager.  Having seen him live several times I already knew he was an incredibly energetic performer, and from a strictly vocal chops department he could sing rings around David Lee Roth.  The album sounds pretty much what you would think a mix of Van Halen and Sammy Hagar would sound like.  I enjoy this one for the most part.  The band head in a heavily pop direction in spots and like \\"1984\\" it is a very keyboard heavy album, but overall I like it.  Yea the lyrics are never going to win a Pulitzer prize and much of the tongue and cheek humor of the Roth years is missing, but there are some good to great songs here and the band are in top form instrumentally.  Some criticize the use of electronic drums on the disc, but they have never really bothered me.  The album would be the first Van Halen album to go to number one and spawned a bunch of hits including \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Summer Nights\\", \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\", and \\"Love Walks In\\".  I like this album a lot better than \\"1984\\" and have always enjoyed the Van Hagar version of the band.
1574535811|3.0|The reader does not do a great job of reading this from the scientific basis - he does not seem to understand the science very much, therefore reads in an unusual manner.  Still, the CD's are a nice alternative if you don't have time to read the book.

B000067CPX|5.0|Some may diss this album and say that it is not as good as BSSM or Californication but the exact opposite is true. This cd is awesome because it showcases John Frusciante's talent as a guitarist and a vocalist. This album is just beautiful and its highlights for me include Don't Forget Me, Cabron, Tear, and Minor Thing. I love this album it is my personal favorite but I think that RHCP get progressively better with each album. This cd definately should have won many awards.  BOTTOM LINE: DON'T OVERLOOK THIS ALBUM!
B000MGB6M8|5.0|I love this movie.  Sure, the ending is a letdown and there's not much depth to the movie overall, but it is simply a fun ride along the way.  The Blu-Ray version looks great.  I'm not big into special features, to be honest, so it doesn't bother me that the disc is rather short on special features.  I do wish that this had both versions - the Director's Cut (which I've never seen) and the original theatrical version, but they've only included the original.  That's the only real letdown for me.

B0000AM6BN|4.0|The Disco Diamonds series is focused heavily on European electronic dance music of the 80s, sometimes hi-nrg sounding, sometimes more new wave. While most of the tracks are obscure songs not relevant to the US market at the time, every once in a while, a volume will have one or two underground US hits that are more than great to find on CD at last in their full length mixes. This volume is pretty much free of any major US favorites, BUT, the one reason for the 80s music completist to have this is the full 12\\" version of the only dance song ever recorded, in 1984, by Kim Fields, most well known as \\"Tootie\\" on the Facts of Life!!! This song is sure to be highly sought after because of its rarity, yet here it is in digital format. Get it while it's still around. Track times for this CD:<br /><br />1.

0394873742|5.0|we gave this to our four-year-old grandson. we then spent much of the days that followed reading and laughing at its contents (and learning some things too).     understatement: it was a huge hit. even if you have other scarrys -- and the content of this one does overlap the content of some other titles -- its format makes it special.     recommended without reservation!

B000FA57N0|5.0|Without getting into the plotline or pretending I am a master movie critic like so many others do, I WILL say, you would have to be in the foulest of moods to NOT enjoy this movie. I played only 5 minutes of this DVD for my sister of 40+ yrs & her 3 daughters (none of whom even like SCI-FI shows.....\\"Star Wars\\" bored them) and they were glued to the set! I clicked the DVD player off because I knew they had a favored TV show coming on soon and they all just about took my head off & demanded of me to turn \\"Serenity\\" back on. The characters are portrayed perfectly by the cast and are all believable. One does not need to know the series to enjoy this movie but if you don't see the series, you are really missing out on more GREAT action/drama/laughs. The only down side to buying the series is that \\"Fire Fly\\" ran only a limited number of shows. The Hi-DEF is a definate plus to the regular DVD and well worth the purchase price.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I am most definetly an amateur photographer, but realized that for some of my indoor shots, the flash on my D40x was not enough to gain the effect I wanted.

0316143472|4.0|Although this isn't as laugh out loud funny as some of his previous work, it is still well worth your time. I know one complaint people have with this book is that most of it has been published else where, but since I never read any of the magazines his work regularly appears in it was all fresh to me. Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down and I was sad to see it end.  I especially enjoyed the last 1/3 of the collection.<br /><br />If you love David Sedaris, I don't know how you could be disappointed with \\"When You Are Engulfed In Flames\\".  I know for myself, I'll take all the time with him I can get.  If you are new to his work, this may not cause you to fall crazy in love with him like so many of us are, but it will certainly entice you to read previous works that have the power to do so.

B00102F5WK|4.0|There's a lot on this DVD, almost all of it interesting and informative.    The movie itself is a dramatization of a composite case in which a traveler with a Middle Eastern name and heritage gets flagged as having possible terrorist ties, is waylaid by US/coalition authorities, and is sent to an \\"undisclosed location\\" where he is subjected to brutal bouts of questioning and torture. All this happens because of what might have been a simple cell phone mix-up.    However, to the movie's credit, while making a moving humanitarian appeal against such treatment, it does not foreclose on the possibility that this traveler might have some al-Qaida ties. The movie also tries to give at least some weight to our State Department's arguments for the necessity of extracting information by any means. Meryl Streep makes the Government case with chilling pragmatic efficiency.    So this movie does recognize some of the complexities involved. It is not a simplistic good guys vs. bad guys screed. This becomes especially true as it interweaves the story of two young Middle Eastern lovers caught up in the inflamed politics of their fundamentalist culture.    Then this DVD contains what is tantamount to a whole second feature film - this one a documentary outlining the cases of two men who actually were tortured at such top-secret compounds located in out-of-the-way places around the globe. These undisclosed locations actually exist and are the receiving points for suspects detained under the Rendition Act.    Neither of the two men interviewed here are Americans. The testimony of the German National from a Middle Eastern background is especially poignant. He talks about how his life was derailed by the torture he endured after he was taken, hooded and humiliated, to one of these sites - on the flimsiest evidence of any terrorist involvement.    Finally, the DVD comes with a particularly intelligent Director's commentary. It will be worth your while to watch the features again, with this commentary turned on. In the end, Director Hood calls his project \\"a poetic lament.\\" There's probably no better way to sum up the complex, compelling tragedies brought home by this DVD.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old son as a sampler album.  It is a great starter for someone just getting hooked on Led Zeppelin.  It is missing a few of my favorites but my son loves it.  Plus, I don't mind if he turns this one up.
B0013URJTG|5.0|Lightbulb Sun has long been one of the most elusive CDs in the Porcupine Tree catalogue, a fact which I always found strange since it is also one of those most sought. I was able to obtain a copy here on amazon several years ago from one of the partners. The packaging said it was recorded in the UK, but it was shipped to me from Russia, so I always wondered whether or not it was bootleg. But now that Snapper Music has issued this excellent CD/DVDA package, Porcupine Tree fans will no longer have to pay premium prices for an inferior recording.  To me, albums like Lightbulb Sun and Stupid Dream are the heart and soul of what PT is all about. I like the entire album, but I do have favorites. Those are the eerie title cut, the pounding Four Chords That Made A Million, the soaring Shesmovedon, the futuristic Last Chance To Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled; the driving Hatesong, and the spacy Russia On Ice. The DVDA is excellent as well, but some buyers may have to alter their settings in order to view and hear it on their sound systems.  The CD is packaged in a stylish and sturdy jewel case and is accompanied by a handsome booklet filled with lyrics, pictures, and all pertinent album information. Reading the lyrics as you listen will enhance your enjoyment of this masterpiece. Currently, it is being sold here at a great price, so if you are one of those missing Lightbulb Sun in your PT collection, now is the time to buy! You will treasure it for life.
0385338082|5.0|Read this book on vacation - I breezed through it faster than any other book because I just could not put it down. Funny and warm - definitely perfect read on the beach with a cocktail! :)
B000VSBX34|5.0|I am probably committing heresy here but I've recently watched both A Hard Day's Night and Help! in high-def and I have to give Help! the edge, in spite of its far-fetched plot involving a magic ring. Let's face it, both of these movies have their plot defects, but Help! comes through somehow fresher.(I would have felt differently 30 years ago).    One thing that I found evident was just how much the television show, The Monkees, that I grew up with was a blatant (but well-done) rip-off of Help! When I was a kid, growing up in the 70's, the Beatles were yesterday's news, but the Monkees' show was on every afternoon, and as Michael Stipe has often said, was perhaps a bigger influence on that generation than the disbanded Beatles, whom I would discover through listening to Wings, about the time that Wings began to falter.    Anyway, watching Help! is a bit like watching an extended Monkees episode(Yes, they all had ridiculous plots just like Help!) and for the MTV generation who came prior to The Real World, this will feel comforting because Help! is basically full of music videos.    The newly-released print looks sensational. I am not sure if I have ever seen a color movie from that era that looks as good as the new Help! DVD and the movie seems a lot better than it did the first time that I saw it back in the mid to late 1970's. The boys look great and were at the height of their musical prowess and their beauty as men. They would never again look this great together and appear to be such great friends, just having a sensational time as mates.     Every Beatles' fan should buy this.

B00005ATQD|5.0|I saw this movie in a theater, when it was premiered years ago.  I found it haunting, dreamlike, and outside the normal realm of moviemaking.  Most people did not like the movie then and I would assume most would not like it now.  Its a movie that polarizes.  I recently had the chance to view it again.  Mesmerizing is the best way I can describe it.  It pulls you into a dreamlike world and leaves you with many unanswered questions.  The most chilling, riveting scene obviously is the \\"party\\". But what really gets to me in this scene is the deliberate striking of the piano keys especially the occasional but intentional off-key notes.  It exudes forbodding and mortal anxiety.  It is the quintessential cult scene.  Kubrick created a movie that has aged well.  Highly reccommended, but surely not for everyone.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|Persuasion is my favorite novel.  The BBC adaptation from 1995 is one of my favorite movies.  That said, I had high hopes for this adaptation.  This film did not make the best possible use of the talents of the actors cast, and it changed the story so that it doesn't make sense anymore.    RP-J was given nothing to do but smolder.  Amanda Hale's Mary was positively dreadful; she looked as if she was trying to channel Sophie Thompson and she did not succeed.  Sally Hawkins is, frankly, not attractive enough for Anne.  And, before you think I'm being shallow, I should point out that Austen's Anne is described as being a very pretty girl.  Sophy Croft is only supposed to be 8 years older than her brother Frederick, but she looks more like his aunt or his mother here.     The scene where Wentworth picks Anne up and plops her on the back of the Crofts' gig misses the point.  In the book, Anne's (and ours) reaction to that is to think that, perhaps, he still cares for her somewhat.  In this movie, it looks like he wants nothing at all to do with her.      The \\"Bath Marathon\\" at the end of the film was ludicrous. The fish-mouthed kiss was disgusting.  Wentworth buying Kellynch Hall for Anne is impossible (William Elliot will inherit it).  And what is with Mrs. Smith running along side Anne?  Mrs. Smith is an invalid.  Is Nurse Rooke a miracle worker?     But moving the constancy conversation from Bath to Lyme and having it be between Anne and Benwick is the biggest mistake the filmmakers made.  This change makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Wentworth is meant to hear that conversation.  It is the impetus for him to write his letter to Anne.  The first line of that letter is \\"I can listen no longer in silence...\\"  So moving that conversation and preventing Wentworth from hearing it ruins the letter.  How they can justify ruining one of the most beautiful love letters in all of English literature is beyond me.     The book is beautiful and romantic.  This movie is neither.

It has really been helping me and gives me tools to use when I have questions.      The only thing is, it's so colorful sometimes it was a bit much to read so I had to take breaks.  But the book is wonderfully put together and if you're looking for a good book to start with about the Law of Attraction, this is it.  The chapters are broken down in a way where you can skip around if you wanted to.

B00005JPLW|5.0|Based on the Frank Miller graphic novel of the same name, 300 is the story of the myth where 300 Spartan soliders dared to go against the Persians who outnumbered them greatly!    This edition also comes with some great extras and behind the scenes looks at how the film was made and what they did to get ready for filming. The most interesting piece for me was explaining what was fiction and fact concerning the Spartan people and what made them unique in the Greek/Persian world of that era.    I will warn that this one is VERY graphic in its violence and blatant in its sexuality. In other words, this isn't for kids so put them to bed for this one!
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Every one of their CD's has improved upon the previous one.  This is the first of their CD's I give 5 stars, but my favorite song of theirs is still the title cut from \\"Leaders of the Free World\\"<br /><br />I think this is a group with a distinct sound that you either love or feel pretty ambivalent towards. My favorite cuts as of this writing are One day like this, an audience with the pope, weather to fly , starlings and Grounds For Divorce.  In a month they may be totally different because their stuff tends to grow on one and doesn't always grab at first listen.  This is one excellent band.
B000J2BRQU|1.0|I watched this DVD just because I have watched Initial D (the same car racing / drifting gerne) animation.  I watched it just because I wanted to know how it could be shot with real people.  To my disappointment, I found it was a very useless theme.  There is no actual reason for this drifting/racing.  I guess that is a teenage thing -- anger.  I believe a lot of 1-star had been giving to this film and I am not going to eleborate any more.      I found it has a real bad influence to anyone who loves cars and those who always wanted to race.  Even though the main character, Sean, never really injured in the movie, all his opponents died!  Right, they all died.  If anyone has a clear mind, Sean is just on the border and he could be the next one in line.      Last 2 words -- Drive Safely.

I enjoy listening to it now as much as I did then, and it's been forty years, almost exactly. I still have a vinyl copy of it I bought new in 1968 or 1969.    One of the reviewers above pointed out that the purpose of these reviews is to get people to listen to and appreciate this music who might not otherwise do so. How true! I hope that occurs. Bloomfield had a troubled and short life, but he managed to get some masterpieces down on tape before he shuffled off this mortal coil: the early Butterfield records, Electric Flag, and these sessions. No one else sounds like Bloomfield; for better or worse, he was his own man. These tracks show his best side, beyond doubt.     It's worth noting that Robben Ford, an extraordinary contemporary blues and jazz guitar master, cites Bloomfield as an early influence and one of the reasons he switched from playing reeds to guitar. Listening to these tracks, you can see why. And after all these years, these tracks still have their poignancy and ringing sad sweetness.
B000Y179KO|3.0|Eagles have done a pretty good job with this effort.  Their vocals are recognizable adn distintive, and as always, make great harmonies.      The first half of the set is, in my opinion, an entire cd of \\"You Can't Hide your Lyin' Eyes,\\"  over and over, with different words, which aren't particularly inspiring.    The 2nd CD is much more musical and creative, with lyrics that say something other than complaining about how badly some woman treated you.  Joe Walsh's \\"Last Good Time in Town\\" was musically tasty and well-written with frighteningly insightful lyrics.  That song itself is with buying the album for.       - FB
B0007KTBIU|5.0|We had a video of Pocahontas, but needed/wanted a DVD. Since we got it in the mail she won't stop playing it. She's two yrs old and tries her best to sing along with all of the songs. Thank you for a great product.
B000000IRG|5.0|We All know Elton John's signature album.  It has it's own unique place in history.    This repoduction is stunning!  Essential for any EJ fan.     - FB
B000002JSP|1.0|Zep went soft and sappy for their studio finale.  \\"In the Evening\\" and \\"\\"Im Gonna Crawl\\"  are okay, but the rest...blech!
B0006J28KU|5.0|Heat is one of the best movies ever!  This special edition is definitely the version to buy because the extra materials like the story of the real Neal McCauley is AWESOME!
B000P0J0G0|3.0|If you like British humor, this pair does a wonderful job of keeping you laughing. I still find it hard to believe that Hugh Laurie can be the harse Dr. House on American TV when he came from such comical beginnings. Enjoy.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This is even better--more compact and convenient without taking away from the quality--thsn the Criterion Laser Disc I have, with all the interesting bonuses included (storyboards, screen tests, etc.)  This is a classic movie in itself...but for the avid fan, this edition is a MUST HAVE for any West Side Story fanatic!
0756404746|3.0|In the end, I'm not really sure what I think about this book.  It's definitely overhyped.  That said, the latter half of it was definitely entertaining, and I never got bored -- even in the slow-paced beginning.  However, the book is definitely flawed.    (Very, very Minor Spoilers below.)    THE GOOD  This is an excellent world that is well defined for the most part.  You really feel like you're getting down and dirty in an ancient culture.  We always know how poor Kvothe is; the money system adds a sense of urgency and interest (especially when Kvothe is in debt!).  I enjoyed the tales of him learning to subsist on his own; he was always on the edge of disaster and learning how to survive.  Quite entertaining!    The magic is not well described at first, and a couple of times I was confused and had to re-read passages.  However, as soon as I got the gist of it, I enjoyed it.  It works on a completely logical standpoint and is really no more than dangerous super-physics, which I found a refreshing take on the subject.    The final 200 pages or so are just good fun -- how Kvothe defeats a big stoned fire-breathing lizard is terribly enjoyable, and the aftermath of Ambrose's charges of malfeasance?  Delightful.    Lovely writing, too.  I love how the Prologue and Epilogue mirror each other.  Rothfuss also has a nice way with poetry!    THE BAD  I entirely agree with previous reviewers: this book needed to be pared down big time.  Rothfuss goes on and on and on about pieces of Kvothe's life that, while important, shouldn't be so darn long.  Three chapters (at most!) could have been devoted to the massive chunk in the middle of the novel devoted to Kvothe's Tarbean exploits.  It is notable that while he scrabbles about in the city, he never, ever acts like a \\"genius.\\"  Yeah, yeah, he's \\"broken,\\" but to lose all of his acuity?...  It's ridiculous.  Of course, the reason for all this padding is because Rothfuss needed a reason for Kvothe to learn some minor skills and hear some background about the Chandrian... but it only ended up cluttering the narrative.  It would have been simpler to make Kvothe more of a human being than a godling, thereby focusing on what is more important: the larger plot (which is woefully under-developed).  The book picks up in the last 200 pages in a sign of what \\"should have been.\\"  Rothfuss can write, don't forget it!  By the same token, by making Kvothe a super-character and backing up why he can do all of these amazing things, he loses sight of the plot entirely... if there was one to begin with.    The villains are simultaneously hackneyed and interesting. On one hand, they spout the same goofy lines that all villains seem required to say.  On another, I like that they are hard to trace and relatively quiet; the best villains don't galumph around causing mass mayhem for nothing. In my opinion, this implies intelligence. Sadly, Rothfuss features them only twice throughout the entire book -- a shame. Especially a shame since they're supposed to be the focal point of some sort of plot. After Tarbean and the University, they just seem tacked on, which doesn't seem right.    I think the biggest flaw with this book is the characterization.  Kvothe walks a narrow road between blatant \\"Gary Stu\\" and \\"realistic genius.\\" Sometimes he was so annoying that I wanted to punch him -- mostly because he was so darn good at everything.  He can pick locks, act better than an Oscar-winner, memorize whole plays and difficult songs, play and sing like Orpheus, attract hot women with little effort, get PAID to go to school because of his brilliance, be promoted to a higher rank within two years when it takes other students 4-5 times as long, accurately judge a horse's quality after years of not even passing an idle glance at one, and on top of it all, he's got a nice looking face, eyes that change color, and bright hotrod-red hair.  Who do you know like this?  And how many of you really want to be friends with such a person?  I entirely expected a few lines to be devoted to Kvothe's heritage as an incarnation of Tehlu.  I fear that this trend will only continue, as we're promised that Kvothe will learn how to sword-fight (like a pro, I expect) and fight some angels and basically become more incredibly unbelievable.  Face it: most people excel at only one or two things, even geniuses.    Thankfully, Kvothe has enough problems that almost balance him out... and I stress \\"almost.\\"  The element that really saves this book is that we're starting from the present -- when a depressed, broken Kvothe tells his story.  If he wasn't so messed up \\"now,\\" I would despise him, and I would have returned this book after a mere 50 pages.  As it was, I nearly dropped the book on several occasions.    Secondary characters suffer as a result of Kvothe's super-powers.  \\"Good\\" characters are those who revolve around Kvothe; they are colorless, bland satellites, providing a laugh or two at best.  \\"Bad\\" characters, or those who question Kvothe's character (i.e., those who don't kowtow to Kvothe's inherent awesomeness), are \\"taught a lesson\\" (with the exception of teachers -- since they are necessary tools to teach Kvothe the arcane arts).  It is telling that the only person Kvothe can really empathize with is a woman who is almost as amazing as he is.  She has red eyes, memorized the whole of a difficult song after singing it twice, and is incredibly gorgeous.  Oh, please!    Frankly, I couldn't tell many of the characters apart.  The number of quality characters could be counted on one hand -- Elodin and Auri being the best.  The rest of them are plain vanilla boring -- after all, how can these regular joes compare to a god like Kvothe?  Kvothe's friends are interchangeable and even until the end of the book, I wasn't sure who was who in his inner circle.  I didn't even have a good feeling for the teachers, which is inexcusable; Rothfuss spent almost no time fleshing them out at all.  The names, personal and nationality-wise, don't help; it's like Rothfuss pulled out random Scrabble tiles and stuck them together (Kvothe?  Seriously, what is that? Did his keyboard explode?).  I still haven't figured out any of the randomly dropped country names or what the different ethnicities are famous for.  And I shouldn't have to look at the little map to know!    In many respects, this is a book about how awesome, intelligent, and wonderful Kvothe is.  And that's bad.  He was never really a person I could identify with.  I never felt \\"with\\" him; I was excited FOR him, especially when he overcame some nasty odds, but at the end of the book, I didn't care whether he lived or died.  I had the kind of interest in him that a spectator in the ancient Roman Coliseum might have had in a gladiator: I'm interested in his exploits, but not in him personally.    Would I buy this book?  Nah.  I'd get it at the library, enjoy it for what it's worth, and take it back.  I wouldn't jump at the second book, either.  But it's good for what it is... a fun little trip out of this world, if you can stand a bothersome egocentric know-it-all for a protagonist.
B0002KVULG|5.0|World-class actors in a famous story set against incredible backgrounds  with a John Williams score makes this my favorite Dracula movie.  Frank Langella's sensuous portrayal of the vampire is intelligent and fun to watch as he crosses foils with Laurence Olivier's Van Helsing in the classic battle for Kate Nelligan's soul as Lucy.  Donald Pleasance balances out the action with his gift for understatement and wit.  This is a must-see version.
1401216676|5.0|This is one of the best Batman Comics. Great artwork and story! Well, I'm a great Joker fan and I like almost everything of his stories but this one is really really good! It also comes in great hardcover with some extra materials inside. If you want a great Joker and Batman story, you should buy this comic book!    Gretings from Croatia :)
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|With over 244 reviews already provided, I'll just keep this short and sweet:  a good cast with good dialogue set with action that moves out smartly plus some great shooting scenes equals a good movie worth watching.
0810993139|5.0|My 9 year old son absolutely loves this book.  He read it so quickly we bought the next book Roderick Rules.  Can't go wrong with this book.  My son was actually excited by reading and laughed through the whold thing.  Very positve reading experience for a child who absolutley hated reading.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a great movie my grandson loves it. He wants to watch it all the time.
0810994739|5.0|I bought Diary of a Wimpy Kid first and my son wouldn't put it down and this child hated any type of reading material.  He liked it so much we got Diary of a Wimpy Kid Roderick Rules and he absolutely raced through its pages.  I would tell all parents to run out and buy this book.
6305882592|4.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I had to watch it for a Cult Films class that I am taking at my university, and it ended up being my favorite film out of the quarter.  It is a story about a boy (Harold) who is obsessed with staging his own suicide, drives a hearse, and attends funerals for fun.  While he is at one of these funerals, he meets an elderly lady named Maude, who he finds absolutely captivating and eventually falls in love with.  However, at the mean time, the boy's mother decides that it is about time for Harold to meet a girl and get married.  So, she uses a computer program to generate dates for him.<br /><br />Pretty funny movie, kind of off-beat, but I really enjoyed it, so i ended up purchasing it so that i could watch it whenever i feel like it.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|Wonderful CD from a talented band. Classic British pop. Should be released in the US
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This little flash is extremely simple to operate - it has an on/off switch and a bounce flash head. Angle it up to use the ceiling as a reflector or build a small diffuser or reflector with a sheet of paper. Results are extremely good and consistent, but the real news is how tiny it is for its output, and  how many flashes you get from a set of batteries. Comes with a its own little case and takes up no space in your camera bag and weighs nothing. Nikon got it right on this one. Highly recommended.
B000XGDO04|3.0|The songs are catchy and I liked the album, taken on its own it is very good.     Unfortunately her style is similar enough to force the comparison to Amy Whinehouse. And compared to Back to Black or Frank, 19 simply doesn't measure up.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this DVD set for my fiance for Christmas.  He watched every single disc including the \\"behind the scenes.\\"  What these people went through to get these outrageous shots is crazy.  We will never see something like this again.  It's a must have.
B00111WSNO|5.0|Quite simply put this is one of the best metal albums I have heard in years.Its a concept work from Tobias Sammet who also fronts German Power band Edguy.The music is just brilliant,speed,power and just plain good old heavy metal.There are guests on the albums from Edguy,Helloween and Blind Guardian contributing to a feast of lovely metal.The production and sound quality on the albums is fantastic and the work begs to be listened to and played loud.If you havent heard of this band Avantasia you are missing out they are incredible and you will love em.Check out Edguy as well I own 7 of there albums and all I can say is they are one of the best metal bands I have come across,every album they make is great this band dont make so so albums and I highly recommend listening to there works especially the albums Hellfire Club and there latest one Mandrake they will blow you away with just brill quality music.  Another band you must check out are Dream Evil they are just awesome and not too disimilar to Avantasia and Edguy maybe just a bit heavier and come highly recommended.Hope review is of help.Please check out my other reviews on the Amazon UK site you might find something of interest.Cheers.  Hope review is of help.
0452289963|5.0|This book can change your life! Eckhart Tolle is a great author. But in this book, he so clearly explains how all humans create their own suffering, and how to break out of this habit. If you are on a spiritual journey, or if you are not, if you are Christian, Buddha, any religion, or even atheist, you should read this book. I've purchased 3 additional copies to give to other people. (I refuse to loan mine out, as I re-read it over and over.)
B0015UXNGC|5.0|I finished and re-started IJ a few days ago (has anyone else mentioned the little circular chapter-separation icon down in the lower right of the \\"last\\" page?...it's annular, see...), and haven't stopped thinking about it. There is sure as hell a lot to think about here, not just the missing \\"ending\\" (a whole year of events is missing, as I read it) or other little questions (who's \\"Mikey\\"?), but the bigger stuff. But what I'd like to say about this tremendous achievement and instant top-5er on my list is what fun it was to read. I mean fun, pleasure, in real time while reading. I am still having a blast (re)reading this fantastic piece of post?modern art.
B00004YZFR|5.0|This is a superlative and surprising documentary that clearly shows the business acumen and professionalism of the Rolling Stones as they effortlessly blended their talents and showmanship into the drug racked culture of a 60s rock concert. Not to be missed.
0345479092|5.0|i read this book on a car ride home from New Hampshire and I love llove love it.  our daughter is a a little older than the ones she is dealing with, (not in the 03 month stage) but it's all applicable.       i love her middle of the road approach, i love the basic routine information..  I think it's all fabulous.  Today is day one of our EASY attempts, and it's working like a charm.          There is a lot of insight here in this little book.  It's something I wish i had when i was pregant, or when our little one was just born.   But it's fabulous.       in response to the post about bad breast feeding advice...  I think she spends so much time making the case for formula because there is such an innundation of information on on breast feeding.  I didn't feel like she wasn't making her argument.  On the contrary, i felt she was taking into consideration that the reader was already semi educated about breast feeding.  What she did say about breast feeding I think was important to say - that it has to be learned, that it has to be a mother's choice, that it is a good thing to do.  BUT that formula is good too, and that the guilt trip that comes with every mother who chooses to formula feed over breast feeding needs to stop NOW.                 She also doesn't come across and say Attachment parenting is bad.  She doesn't.  But the goal in the book is to raise an independent child. A child that can fall asleep on their own.  A child that can get to understand te routine in the day, their role in the family.     I know for me, we were doing semi demand feeding, but then nothing else got done.   The baby HAD to be held  so much of the time.   and as much as I love it, practically, it's not going to work.  So she shows you (or she showed me) how to work routine in to the mix with the EASY method, how to play, how to take care of yourself and how to get your baby to sleep.          So I Love this book.   I would recommend it to anyone.  I think it's worth the read and isfull of great advice.
B0014KD46W|4.0|I've been listening to the music of Steve Winwood since first hearing him with Spencer Davis.  He never stops growing and changing.  I've enjoyed the ride.  I hope he continues making great music far into the future.  This is another fine chapter in his life.  Good job!
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I love Will Smith I think that he has more talented than he realizes. He has matured into a fine young Gentlemen. His parents should be very proud.  I enjoy thid movie as I have his others.Just keep doing what you are doing.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|Have watched this movie 4 or 5 times. Always wanted to buy this for keeps sake. Lovely story and beautifully scripted movie. I definitely recommend it not only to watch it but buy it for the library.
B0013FBS20|5.0|It was great to have 2 endings, but I would have to say the theatrcal ending was the best.
B000YAA68C|2.0|I watched this with my wife hoping it would be an entertaining love story and was disappointed.  Neither my wife or I enjoyed this movie.  The storyline is not great, it needed something more to keep it interesting for the duration.  Half way through we were ready for it to be over.  The acting was not bad it but the dialog and story progression needed a lot of work.  WARNING: I WILL BE GIVING AWAY WHAT THE STORY IS MAINLY ABOUT SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW PLEASE STOP READING THIS REVIEW HERE.     The whole point of the movie was to develop the obvious point that her love is gone and must now move on was unoriginal and boring.  It was too drawn out and deserves no where close to the 4 stars it averages on this site.
B000W4D94I|5.0|It does not matter how many times I watch this movie.  It gets better every time.
0765318741|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" contains mostly short stories, where the book's first half is one story titled by the novel's namesake.  The remaining creepy stories cover various characters, whether a younger or older male or female, and places each person in a disturbing situation.  The finely crafted plots capture the morbid struggles against a range of supernatural forces.<br /><br />Since the story \\"I Am Legend\\" composes the largest amount of the book, it receives the greatest attention.  It is about the supposedly last member of the human race, 36 year old Robert Neville.  Daily he fights vampires and his own depression while trying to survive the deadly nights.  The author brilliantly explains vampirism from a scientific perspective and additionally provides a shocking conclusion.  The other stories while shorter are just as effectively engaging.<br /><br />As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel to any fan of the horror genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000003TAL|5.0|A beautiful breed of melody and dissonance. Give it a few listens before casting judgment: their note patterns are anything but traditional, and one must forget the usual Western constructs of music theory before appreciating the brilliance of this album. My favorite tracks are Silver Rocket, The Sprawl, Cross the Breeze, Candle, and Kissability. I am a huge Sonic Youth fan, and this is my favorite. If you're new to SY, a good album to try afterward is Sonic Nurse or Goo. Once you appreciate their sound-- the discordance as well as the beauty-- you can get into their earlier gems such as EVOL or Sister.
0151003084|5.0|I bought three of these books as gifts for three retiring teachers -- they are so funny.  An ABC book of odd outcomes for students.  Love them.
0913866156|5.0|This is an awesome deck!  The artwork is stunning and the symbolism is everywhere.  There are several reviews that say the the deck printed in belgium is just horrible and not worth the effort it takes to rub two pennies together, but this is just not true.  I have a friend that also has a deck and when I compared them there was a difference, but it wasn't as bad  as I thought that it was going to be.  My cards are in great proportion and there is no green tint as was described.  I hope this is helpful.
0446691437|5.0|Not only will this book help you make the next move in your life, it will help with the down times as well.  Very motivational.
0891419195|5.0|I am not an avid book reader and it usually takes me a long time to finish a book but I could not put this book down. It is written like the average person wrote it, I didn't have to look up any words in the dictionary which made it a very easy read. The story flowed seamlessly and was easy to follow along and visualize as you read. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know about or is curious about the reality of war.
0060763280|5.0|What a Great Book.  Not only does this motivate you to get out and make money, it also has great pratical tips to keep you on track.
B000VS6R26|4.0|`Titanic', the mega-blockbuster film from '97 is a nostalgic, romantic spectacle that won the Academy Award for best film along with 10 more. It has everything one would demand from a movie that won so many awards; wonderful period costumes, expert attention to detail and an absolutely magnificent soundtrack all framed beautifully on an ocean vessel befitting its name.<br /><br />However what ultimately won over its devoted audience was the tender love story between Jack (Leonardo Di Capro) and Rosie (Kate Winslet). It follows a winning formula that's as old as time, handsome but poor young man wins the heart of a wealthy but stifled young woman by helping her discover her passion and see the world through the eyes of the common folk.<br /><br />Yes it's a little over romanticized and if not for the epic sinking sequence at the end of the film this might have fallen into the category of nothing more than a \\"chick flick\\" but I think there's enough here to keep the male viewers focused for the most part. After all, there's nothing wrong with concentrating on the lovely Kate Winslet until they hit the iceberg.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 ½ Stars-.
0061438294|5.0|This book reinforces non-verbal communications for all humans. I enjoyed this book throughly.  Dutch
0316286850|5.0|I bought this book and Face Forward for my 13 y.o. niece. I am a professional makeup artist and she has expressed an interest in makeup too.  Anyway, she has really enjoyed them.  They are great books to have for reference or just for fun and inspiration.  Kevyn AuCoin is amazing.
055358894X|5.0|Fantasy book lovers (and lovers of good books in general), this book was just simply a lot of FUN!  The story telling is great, the dialogue real and genuinely funny at times, and the world created feels real.  Give this one a try, you will not disappointed.  I am looking forward to reading the second book - Red Seas Under Red Skies.  Thanks, Scott Lynch!
B000H4JGZY|5.0|Justin Timberlake is the bomb. I love this cd more than I can possibly express. The music is simply...Hot. If you like to dance your tushy off, this is the cd for you.
0679847367|5.0|Excellent gift for a highschool or college graduation.  Dr. Seuss may have written this as a childrens book but I think it is excellent for a young adult.  I always give this as a graduation gift.  If you haven't ever read it, you should and you will see why it is a perfect gift for a young adult!
B000ULPFH2|4.0|I've already ordered this minor classic from an outfit in Canada which is closing out their HD DVD selections and reducing their prices as low as $5.99!! Compared to the duo's \\"Scarface\\", this little film noir gem hits practically all the right notes- Pacino's authenic Cuban accent, the great supporting cast including a disguised Sean Penn as a corruptible lawyer to a very young John Leguziamo as a young and up coming hood and Viggo Mortenson as a wheel-chaired bound turncoat.  The plot may be old hat---a mobster just released from prison tries to go straight but is prevented from having that life from unseen forces around him--but the execution is grade A!!  For once Pacino plays a sympathetic character and the story is poignant and heartbreaking when he is unable to break free from the criminal life in order to marry his girlfriend (Penelope Anne Miller). I've heard that this film is excellent in HD DVD and for now it is only available in that Hi-def format but when it'll be released in Blu-ray--who knows?  But at the bargain price of $7.99 versus the higher price that will be going in Blu-ray, why wait. Grab this one before it goes out of print in HD and you won't regret it!!
B00000J7J4|5.0|This work is Santana at his best. His collaboration with other artists adds to both making an explosion of talent. An audio treat best listened to at night when the imagination can fire up and see his work.    Brilliant.    Susan
1423101464|5.0|This is an awesome series and has my 4th/5th grader hooked completely.  He now knows more about mythology than I do and could teach me a thing or two.
0670020745|5.0|I had no idea that the human brain was so interesting!  An educational and inspiring account of the author's own stroke and recovery.  I was particulary interested in the apparent parallels between the ways the brain's right and left hemispheres work and human psychology and religious insight.<br /><br />I was struck too by her description of how standard hospital and stroke treatment protocols work against the stroke victim's recovery.  After reading the book I remembered visiting my father in a nursing facility and thinking what an unpleasant atmosphere it was for patients.  After being sensitized by Taylor's descriptions, I now think that much of the problem was the presence of all those televisions blaring away. I hope that those in charge of such facilities read this book and take it to heart.<br /><br />A fascinating account of a potentially disastrous trauma, I am thankful that Dr. Taylor made the deicsion to recover and share these precious experiences with us.
B000H5V8DG|3.0|I love Alias more than any other show I can remember.  So, I was very excited when I was able to purchase the full series.  Problem is that it's not the whole series.  The first SEASON wasn't even in the box.  What kind of \\"Complete Collection\\" doesn't have the first season!?  I loved the box it came in and the discs were in good shape.  BUT, not complete and I paid a pretty penny for this collection.  I am not happy about the missing season, at all!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD does just what it claims to do! Jillian is great!! I can't believe the results. I've had this workout for about a month now and all I can say is,\\"It delivers!\\" I've lost several inches already. For extra calorie burning I also do 2 of the 3 workouts at a time. Jillian is the best motivator. We own almost every workout she has made and they are all challenging. But this one is super tough. She'll make you do the entire workout, even when your dripping sweat and think you can't go on.     My 2 teenagers do the workouts along with me. My son loves this workout. My wish is that she'll not only make more dvd's in this series to keep us going, but also add some co-ed workouts again(like in her shape up series). My son feels a little funny getting his butt wooped by 3 buff ladies. But as long as we're in our own home, he's ok with it.     Keep them comming Jillian! We're sold for sure. I highly reccomend this as well as all of her previous workouts to get in killer shape. We also like the Biggest Looser series with Jillian, Bob & Kim. All great trainers(See my review there as well). There is no reason to go to the gym when you can get this kind of support and variation at home. Stay motivated fellow fitness friends!
B0018QCXGY|4.0|I loved this movie.  Very interesting and the \\"monster\\" in it was super creepy looking.  You never find out what it is or where it came from, just that it can't be destroyed, at least by conventional methods.  No conclusion to the film really either.  But god it's fun to watch.  Better than \\"I Am Legend\\" in my opinion.    For those who have complaints about this film.  First, I have Meniere's disease (extreme vertigo) and I didn't have a problem watching this movie.  And if I can watch it without getting sick or dizzy, then the average Joe should be able to as well.  Second, about the beginning being boring.  Yeah, it's not an action-packed film right from the opening scene, but you've got to give the reader a backstory to get them interested and vested in the characters so you care about what happens to them.  If you didn't know why would you care?      I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because I think that the average movie goer would want some kind of conclusion or resolution to the film.  Like were they able to kill the monster, is there any chance of survival after the bombing, what did NYC look like when it was all said and done, etc.  My guess is they may have left it open perhaps for a sequel of some sort.    Another reason to not give a full 5 stars is that when I first saw it I thought \\"Blair Witch\\" through the whole thing.  Very \\"Blair Witch\\" as far as film style.  It's just been done before that's all.      Overall I think it'll be a cult classic hit - lots of people won't like this movie, but lots will and that will make it do very well overall.  We just got a PS3 and I can't wait to watch this movie on Blu-Ray with our 1080p big screen TV.  It should be even more amazing!
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I mainly bought this album because I saw the live show and loved the version of the Blackbird song they played in FULL during the show.  However, the CD only contains a few brief seconds of this song.  All the other songs are great (different from the originals), but I really bought the album for the Blackbird song and felt a bit cheated.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I saw this wonderful production live in New York and the video is very effective in recreating the excitement, talent and energy of the theater experience.
B000002KCC|4.0|All of the criticisms of this album/CD are accurate and I still think that it is a worthwhile addition to any collection.  The vinyl album record cover had a spooky pic of Crazy Horse with each band mamber identified by name with no image of anyone standing in the spot labeled \\"Danny Whitten\\", and so the journey into addiction, death, reclusion, introversion, and depression begins.  It appears that Young himself was experiencing his own personal trauma of the events of those days and it shows.  You may not like the questions.  You may not like the answers.  But, you may grow to like the music, \\"late at night when the people were gone...\\" which is probably both the best time and the worst time to listen to Tonight's the Night.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|THIS WAS THE BEST SEASON EVER!! I loved the season, Because it's very mystreyious and Adventures!! I can't wait to the extended scences and got this box set, so i can enjoy it again and again!!    P.S I can't wait for season 5 to come on TV!!  P.S(2). I Recommend It!!
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I have never read the book so I can't comment or compare based on that. However, as a film, it falls somewhat flat. There is no great mystery or intrigue. The characters are very bland. Eric Bana has very little to do in the film. His screen time feels wasted and unimportant. Natalie Portman does what she can, but she feels out of place. Her accent is OK, but i expected better from someone like her. Scarlett J. is the only one in the film that actually remembered to act. I actually cared what happened to her as opposed to anyone else. Kristen Scott Thomas, as the mother did a great job in a small role. The actual script is bland and a tad on the boring side. The editing could use some work as they switch from one time fram to another in a matter of seconds. One scene, someone finds out they are pregnant, then literally, the next scene, they are giving birth. It is very jumpy at times. The costumes are lovely and accurate. As for how accurate the actual film is, that is up to debate but I am sure they embelished QUITE a bit. For once, I wish a film based on such important history could be made, and actually be correct and accurate, or as accurate as they can get. All in all, not a terrible movie by any means, but nothing you're missing either if you choose not to watch.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|They could revive the magic of the first season with proud, elevating the level of the dialogs. The drama's are more mature. The investigation, more realistic. The acting, superb. When you can make these items be together in such a nice way, there's a fantastic story. Too bad that it got cancelled, but I'm proud to be able to have these pieces of art, which surely cannot be replaced.
0307237702|4.0|Barack Obama's second book looks at the intricacies of American politics and looks at where it has all gone wrong. The book itself reads like an elongated speech, and in a way it is; Obama's first expressed many of these ideas in his keynote speech-also entitled, `The Audacity of Hope'- during the 2004 democratic convention. The book looks at a wide range of issues, from the constitution to education to the Iraq War. However, the portion of the book that really stuck out to me was his views on Republicans and Democrats and the toll their bickering is taking on the American public. Obama states that politicians and even the public need to look past the tag of Republican or Democrat and look at the best interest of the country. I completely agree with this assessment, because I feel that acts such as filibustering in the senate, is holding the US back from passing legislation, that could potentially benefit the American public. Obama's book has been criticized by someone people, because they believe the literature itself is not that great and that the book reads too much \\"like outtakes from a stump speech-NY Times\\". However, I believe that this a book that can be read in short spurts, because each chapter analyzes different issues, pertaining to American politics. This book may not be the best piece of literature, but it is very interesting, a characteristic I believe is more important than the writing techniques. In our growing cosmopolitan society, it is increasingly important for books to be captivating, because people only have time to read books that quickly grab their attention and don't waste time with the fancy language, that the reader then has to wade through in order to actually find the story. That is why The Audacity of Hope is such a great book for this day and age; it can be read for short periods of time and it doesn't waste any time, in getting the reader captivated.
B0015GDVTU|3.0|This is a pleasant romantic comedy. Gerry Butler is certainly engaging enough as the male half of the equation. Hillary Swank plays such a high-pressure female always flying off the handle and finding it hard to relax. It was hard for me to see any chemistry between her and Butler or anyone else for that matter. There are some beautiful shots of Ireland in the Blu-Ray transfer, and the sound is quite nice. The story line is based on a very comprehensive plot that Butler concocts, that I find difficult to believe he could have forseen or even afforded to pull the scheme off. The whole magilla kind of peters out in the last reel and ends fortuitously for all (almost as if the studio had to call it quits on the film and end it happily). Enjoyable, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it (it's a date movie after all--cleverly designed to make us guys feel totally inadequate).

0802130208|5.0|I really adore this book. It has some of the best written sentences for humor I have ever been exposed to. Any book that says \\"Canned food is a perversion and ultimately detrimental to the soul\\" or \\"my pre-disposition to morbidity\\" is okay with me. The main character's diction was enough to make me chuckle and laugh several times through out the entire book. Not to mention the zany situations he puts himself in and how the rest of the characters interact with him.    I felt that all of the cast was fun and connected to the story seamlessly. I was wondering how all of these odd-balls would congeal to create a well-paced story, but the author definitely delivered on that. The supporting cast was equally as crazy and provided a change of pace the complimented the main character Ignatius. Whether it was Jones who never took of his sunglasses or Gloria/Trixie mistress of commerce helping out with the job, this book ways always cracking me up    The characters are crazy. The vocabulary used is crazy. Hell, this book is crazy. But it held itself together and created the most comedic experience I've had with a book before.

B0010X745K|5.0|To say that I wasn't expecting much from this film is an understatement. During a recent trip to my local movie store, they were getting rid of all their current back stock of DVD's and I was able to purchase this gem for $2.50. My wife is the horror fanatic and also the one who put it in. I was sitting in the kitchen, working on my novel, when I started to crane my neck over the counter to watch what was going on. Andre Braugher is one of my favourite actors of all time and he unfortunately is in too little offerings these days.<br /><br />I complained when it started, saying: \\"here we go again, another Stephen King adaptation full of no-name / B-list actors in a made for TV drama. Lemme guess, some toxic sludge escapes during a power outage and acts like a growth compound on the surrounding wildlife?\\"<br /><br />How wrong I was, and how quickly I got sucked in.<br /><br />I'm not going to include any spoilers in this, as this is a film that folks that love the genre, love Stephen King -- must see and continue to watch to the bitter end. While some may bemoan the ending, you have to come to terms with the difference between a bad ending and an incredibly disturbing one. This film has an incredibly disturbing ending and bothered me well into the next day - not a bad ending. I wouldn't want to be cast into that scenario for all the gold in the world. The Mist is an excellent film* (note I said film and not movie) that I would've paid to see in the theatre and would've purchased on DVD for full price. It's too bad that they didn't market this film better as the Studios are doing much more for Sci-Fi / Horror these days than they used to.<br /><br />The special effects are also a bonus and not gratuitous, over the top or unnecessary. Frank Darabont has really made a very well-crafted film and worthy of some kind of mention.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just for the sake of things, I watched this movie a second time. Knowing full well what was coming, and having prepared myself mentally, I have to say that it *does* hold up after multiple viewings and actually took an even darker turns in my mind as I realized what I was about to witness again as the film progressed. I'm very surprised that more people aren't talking about this film. It's some of the better, and unexplored, Stephen King material.hold up after multiple viewings and actually took an even darker turns in my mind as I realized what I was about to witness again as the film progressed.

B00005ATZT|5.0|I watched this for the umpteenth time while exercising. Let me tell you, it was effective. Between taking my mind off what I was doing, and raising my adrenaline levels, it made for some intense workouts.    It was based on the TV series, which I never saw, so I don't have a basis for comparison.    The plot is fairly simple. Vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford) returns home and finds his wife murdered. He's arrested, tried, and convicted of the crime, but ends up escaping when a prison transport bus crashes. U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is in charge of the task force hunting for him. Dr. Kimball realizes that the only way to help himself is to discover who really killed his wife--the one-armed man--and who's behind it.    There's a perfect balance here between chase scenes, suspense, and unraveling clues. The chase scenes and the more static suspense scenes didn't drag on until (as happens far too frequently) I got fatigued, and the detective work by both sides wasn't a series of boring sitting-and-thinking scenes, either.    Aside: note to filmmakers: regardless of the type of scene, if it goes on too long, it gets boring (yes, including sex scenes--I've watched enough boring porn movies to know).    It doesn't hurt that the movie stars Tommy Lee Jones, either. Or that he fit the role perfectly. As did Harrison Ford. Though Dr. Kimball was a less exciting character, it made sense that he'd behave the way Ford portrayed him--bewildered, angry, completely out of his depth, but smart and determined. So much so that for a space of time I could believe it wasn't a movie at all.    It's one of my favorites, and one I don't mind re-watching over and over again.

B000W1V5VU|5.0|In the third in this series, Reuben (Elliott Gould) has been scammed out of what he expected to be his retirement fortune by Willie Bank (Al Pacino). As a result, Reuben has a heart attack and ends up bedridden and ill, too depressed to fight back.    So Ocean (George Clooney) and pals decide to get back at Bank in revenge, and to perk Reuben up.    Bank is opening a new casino, and really, really wants the Five Diamonds Award. He's even got the diamonds on display. Ocean's plan isn't to steal from the casino this time, so much as it is to make sure that the casino loses money. A lot of money. And to ensure that he doesn't get the Five Diamonds Award.    There's a lot of high-tech scheming and running around to rig all the games, including a trip to a Mexican factory that makes dice that launches a hilarious subplot, but eventually they run into a snag and have to bring in Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). The price for Benedict's help? The diamonds. Which they've already concluded they can't steal.    So it's impossible--business as usual for this crew.    It's a very fast-moving film, and I just gave up on trying to catch everything. I'll watch it again and catch more of it. I did miss Julia Roberts's character from the first two movies. Ellen Barkin didn't really fill the same niche.    The little things really made the movie for me--the sentimental letters sent to Reuben, the running joke through the film of Danny and Rusty watching Oprah, and the myriad ways they torment the poor guy who's judging the casino for the Five Diamond Award.    And then there's the ending. It's full of poetic justice, and made me leave the theater with a huge grin on my face.

0525950079|1.0|I liked Pillars of the Earth, though it was no masterpiece.  It was at times all too predictable.  But World Without End was truly mailed in.  It is so predictable as to be laughable.  The dialogue was simply atrocious and was not even remotely believable.  I felt like I was reading some sophmoric writing contest.  Either the dialogue worsened as the book progressed, or my patience started to run thin.  I did read the whole thing though -- a sense of watching a train wreck in action.     Follett spent far too much time on unbelievable soap opera characters and situations.  It wasn't anywhere near this bad in the Pillars of the Earth.  Do yourself a favor -- avoid this book -- like The Plague!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I really wanted to like \\"Van Helsing,\\" especially after reading various interviews with the director who acknowledged that he was inspired by his love for the Universal horror classics. Unfortunately, he comes closer to recreating the mediocrity of 1944's \\"House of Frankenstein\\" than one of the studio's superior horror classics from the 1930's.<br /><br />There is a lot to like about \\"Van Helsing.\\" The sets are impressive and the special effects can not be faulted. There are plenty of impressive action sequences that can make you gasp. In the end, though, it proves the old adage that \\"less is more.\\"<br /><br />The movie is positively stuffed from end to end with breathtaking stunts and special effects, leaving little time for character development or story. That's unfortunate because there are, indeed, several novel twists worth exploring, such as Dracula's financial support of Dr. Frankenstein's experiments. But this is simply mentioned then quickly discarded in favor of stunts and effects that grow monotonous because they are so plentiful. There's never time to catch your breath. For some viewers, these complaints may sound more like recommendations. Rest assured, if it's action you want, this movie delivers . . . and delivers, and delivers.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is okay, but his Van Helsing is closer in spirit to Indiana Jones and James Bond than the character created by Bram Stoker and played to perfection in other movies by such actors as Edward Van Sloan, Peter Cushing, Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins. As Dracula, however, Richard Roxburgh seems too intent on channeling Bela Lugosi and too often brings to mind Al Lewis, Grandpa on \\"The Munsters,\\" instead.<br /><br />Frankenstein's monster and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde also put in appearances, but nothing really progresses beyond the surface level. Too bad. The premise is great. The effects are superb. The action is well-staged. The story, however, falls short.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks
B0010358D0|4.0|Ex Machina is a pretty good, but not as good as the first Appleseed movie: [[ASIN:B0007OY31Q Appleseed (Limited Collector's Edition)]]. The CG animation is much improved though. The story line was not as good as it could have been, but the beautiful graphics make up for it. All-in-all though I'd have to say this movie is definitely worth buying for any anime fan, aspiring CG artist, or action movie lover.

Please please satisfy the loyal fans and put Daria on DVD!!!
B000001ELP|4.0|this album is acctually one of the better kiss albums of the 80's, it actually rocks. yes it has a corney story line, but it sounds tones better than the album that should not have been (unmasked) and the rest of the regurgitated 80's crap like asylum.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|For those of you like me who know the Classic Star Trek so well that you can quote whole episodes, this new DVD set is a travesty!!!! I am speaking of the chopped, missing dialog in every episode I have seen!!! (Of course, it may be the station which airs this show, trying to squeeze in more commercials, but I seriously doubt it because the cuts are soooo subtle, you have to KNOW the dialog as I do.) However, going on my first impression: There seems to be some probably 30 something, Yuppish Newbie to Star Trek, who thinks in the modern day style of only allowing 15 to 20 seconds of a take. EXAMPLE: Take \\"The Lights Of Zetar\\". Mira says, \\" I'd rather die than hurt you Scotty, I'd rather die\\".  The last \\"I'd rather die\\" is cut for some reason. I can hear some stuffy college Prof saying \\"that is redundant'!!! to say it twice. But the idea that the emotion is running so high for Lt. Romaine that she HAS to say it twice is, I believe, essential. There are MANY, MANY other example of this modern day editing by someone who thinks they know Star Trek. If you are reading this Mr( or Ms.) Director, let me say this; I knew what Gene and his writers had in mind...you don't, and never will, until you leave your prepacked, hightech, super revved playpen and dwell in the original series for a while instead of trying to leave your mark on it. You stink ....what you are doing is like removing the lamp of the Statue of Liberty because you THINK it obscurs the skyline of New York!!
B000002LA2|5.0|Well worth buying- I especially liked \\"Holy Mother\\" and \\"it's in the Way That You Use it.\\" The other songs were very good, too, if not quite up to those two. No Clapton fan should be without this album.
141694737X|5.0|I introduced this book to my 9-month old son, who immediately took to lifting the flaps like a pro.  This cooperative reading of the book, makes the required multiple readings entertaining rather than tedious.  We've never had a concern about the sturdiness of the flaps, as these are a bit thicker than some other books we've run across us.  Although, please note, my son hasn't figured out that ripping pages might be fun and is appropriately gentle with books.  He is now 21 months old and still requests this book often.  This was also the first book, I saw him browsing by himself, at about 12 months old.

B0013FYTA8|1.0|It saddens me to write this review for a band in Theory of a Deadman that has produced some of my all-time favorite music. \\"Scars and Souvenirs\\" represents one of the wisest purchase decisions I have made in quite sometime in that I did not actually purchase it for myself; it was, rather, a gift for someone else, and therefore I had the chance to listen to it and decide if I wanted a copy for myself before actually buying my own copy.    The answer to that would be a definite \\"no.\\" It pains me to write this, but there really were not three songs on this album that I liked. Two songs, that's it. \\"So Happy,\\" while being far from original, is a decent tune, even with the blatant ripoff (or homage, depending on your perspective) of Alice in Chains on that introductory vocal harmony. The next song, \\"By the Way\\" is also a solid track and possibly the best cut on the record. It is something of a ballad, but its somewhat darker tone definitely reminded me of some of the material from the band's self-titled record - a good thing in my book.    After that, I got nothing. Musically, the only other point on the entire record that stands out to me is the first twenty seconds or so of \\"Bad Girlfriend\\" - or basically until the lyrics begin. Now, Theory of a Deadman have never really been Shakespeare when it's come to lyrical matter, but for the past two records, the lyrics were usually at least decent and if not the most original, then at least they seemed sincere. The lyrics on this record, for the most part, come across as absolutely banal and insipid. \\"Bad Girlfriend,\\" especially, comes across as a cheap imitation of Buckcherry's \\"Crazy Bitch,\\" a song that I can't understand why anyone would want to imitate in the first place.    This record is chock full of ballads, and unlike previous TOAD ballads such as \\"In the Middle\\" or the amazing \\"The Last Song,\\" none of them are the least bit memorable. Instead, they all seem like desperate attempts at securing some moderately successful singles which will shortly thereafter fade into total obscurity. Also, I'm not sure who handled the production for this album, but there was a lot of what can only be described as \\"excessive crap\\" thrown into the songs. There are several songs with some sort of electronic beats or even an organ at one point which, while being potentially great ways to add some spice to the sound if executed properly, nonetheless add absolutely nothing to the song and come across as nothing more than superfluous garbage.    One other song which could have been nice to hear was \\"Hate My Life.\\" While certainly not the least bit original, it is a nice playful little tune that would have been an interesting change of pace on an album like \\"Gasoline.\\" After suffering through the previous six songs on this album, though, it just comes across as annoying.    If you are a newcomer to Theory of a Deadman, having just heard \\"So Happy\\" on the radio, I'd recommend downloading a single copy of \\"So Happy\\" and then checking out \\"Gasoline\\" before buying this. Not only is it simply a better album in my opinion, but the songs you'll find on that album are actually much more similar to \\"So Happy\\" than those found on \\"Scars and Souvenirs.\\" For older fans of the band, definitely take a listen before you buy it. It is a way, way different sound that will no doubt be appealing to some, but for those like me, it will simply leave you asking, \\"Why...?\\"
B000EQ47GS|5.0|If there is one album that captures the arena rock of the 1970s, this 1976 Tom Scholz guitar-laden, wall-of-sound takes off with the first cut - More Than A Feeling - and stays in the stratosphere when the final number - Let Me Take You Home Tonight - fades out.<br /><br />And it's the technical artistry of Scholz on guitar, bass and keyboards, while adjusting the studio dials in his basement studio - where nearly all the instruments were recorded - that hits the home run. Virtually all of the vocals of Brad Delp were done in Los Angeles with Epic Records producer, John Boylan.<br /><br />The mystique of the album was further enhanced through only two tracks including all the musicians who toured as Boston, Foreplay/Long Time and Let Me Take You Home Tonight.<br /><br />With More Than A Feeling, Rock & Roll Band, Smokin' and Hitch A Ride continuing to dominate the Classic Rock radio format, the vision of Scholz that an artist who is given true creative license can ultimately deliver a solid project will continue to be heard as a winning formula.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|Having greatly enjoyed the film \\"Into the Wild\\", as well as Eddie Vedder's musical contributions to the film, I was really looking forward to this album.  However, the album by itself doesn't have nearly the same kind of resonance as in context with the movie.<br /><br />The album is all Eddie, achieving a much more stripped-down effort than this work with Pearl Jam (something along the lines of Nick Drake meets Neil Young).  Musically, there's a lot of great stuff here, consisting largely of acoustic-driven ballads, and of course Eddie's signature vocals.<br /><br />However, the problem lies with the fact that this album is WAY too short.  Most of the songs don't top 3 minutes, and many don't even top 2.  I'm guessing the intended effect here was something similar to a \\"Pink Moon\\" experience, but at times it comes off more like an old Napalm Death album, with songs whizzing by as quickly as they begin.  There are exceptions, such as the hugely epic \\"Hard Sun\\", which serves as the album's centerpiece, and some other great songs, like \\"Guaranteed\\", \\"End of the Road\\", the haunting \\"Society\\", and the nice instrumental piece \\"Tuolumne\\", but many of them, like \\"No Ceiling\\" and \\"The Wolf\\" just feel way too brief to amount to much of anything.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this album about a 3.5 out of 5.  Musically, there's nothing wrong with it, I just find myself wishing there were way more to it.  Still plenty of great melodies here though, and everything fits in really well with the movie (seriously, if you haven't seen this movie, go see it, it's so damn good).  The packaging is nice too, with some cool photos taken from the movie included in the booklet.  I'm definitely not sorry I bought this, but to really appreciate the music here, you have to hear it in combo with the movie.  Believe me, it makes a big difference.<br /><br />Oh, and you might have possibly heard somewhere that Kaki King played on this album, but unfortunately this is not true.  Like Vedder, she did contribute some music to the movie, but none of it was included here.  She does make an awesome appearance on the new Foo Fighters though, so definitely check that out.<br /><br />So yeah, recommended, but maybe don't expect too much...movie, but none of it was included here.

B000YABYLA|5.0|As the first-time effort of secretary-turned-stripper-turned-author-turned-filmmaker Diablo Cody (how's that for a title???), \\"Juno\\" is nothing short of a pleasant surprise.  As of late, I've been sort of gravitating more and more toward the smaller sort of films, that tell a simple but thought-provoking story, in that vein this is about as good as they come.<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" is centered around the title character, a precocious teenager who ends up getting pregnant.  As a result, she finds herself facing challenges and responsibilities well beyond her age.  She finds what appears to be the perfect couple to adopt the baby, but soon finds out they may not be as picture-perfect as she thought.  On top of that, she also must struggle with high school life, and learn to come to terms with the romantic feelings she has for her best friend, the father of her child.<br /><br />Overall, the story is well-written, charming, touching, and thought-provoking, with a perfect balance between comedy and drama.  And of course, I have this movie to thank for initiating what is probably a fairly inappropriate obsession with Ellen Page.  She has always been a remarkably talented actress, even from a young age (check out some of her earlier films she did in Canada), and she really brings this character to life like no one else could.  That perfect blend of acerbic wit and girl next door charm adds up to a performance that's nothing short of captivating.  Oh, and as if it weren't enough that Ms. Page is so tremendously talented and irresistably adorable, she also sings and plays guitar???  Come on, give a guy a break here!<br /><br />But anyway, as fantastic and scene-stealing as her performance is, the rest of the cast is great as well.  Jennifer Garner and the always-hilarious Jason Bateman are both excellent as the potential adoptive parents, Allison Janney and JK \\"J. Jonah Jameson\\" Simmons play minor but still very memorable roles as Juno's father and stepmother, and of course Michael Cera does the whole \\"awkward but likable\\" thing perfectly, as always (even if the shorts he's wearing throughout most of the movie are incredibly disturbing).  Oh, and keep your eye out for a nifty cameo from former Jurassic 5 DJ Cut Chemist as, what else?  A chemistry teacher.  And we can't forget \\"The Office\\" star Rainn Wilson, as the weirdo shopkeeper who speaks entirely in bizarre metaphors that barely make sense.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm probably pretty biased being the major Ellen Page fanboy that I am, but I highly recommend this movie.  She's always fantastic in nearly everything she does, but I think this is definitely one of her best performances to date (along with \\"Hard Candy\\", which is also brilliant, but in a really different way).  I'm pretty sure I'll be watching this over and over until the day I die.\\"awkward but likable\\" thing perfectly, as always (even if the shorts he's wearing throughout most of the movie are incredibly disturbing).

0385522401|1.0|McEwan appears to like to write depressing stories with an overwhelming amount of boring details.  Very difficult to plod through.  This book takes the cake.  Who wants to read pages and pages of excruciating details of a couples intimate sex life on their wedding night.  I've forced myself to read half the book, but I don't know if I can talk myself into finishing it.  In the beginning I tried twice to start reading it and couldn't get interested.  Then someone in our book club recommended it, so I'm trying to make myself read it.  Don't think I'll succeed in finishing it.

B000YABYLA|2.0|I'm a film buff -- I've even majored in it at the University of Texas.  I know my perspective on films is a bit different than most, but if a film gets lots of positive buzz, I'm usually not disappointed in it.<br /><br />JUNO did not live up to my expectations.  First, what is it trying to be?  A comedy?  It has funny moments, but nothing to make it stand out.  A drama?  Certainly not a compelling drama.  Dramedy?  Frankly, BOSTON LEGAL does better dramedy on a weekly basis...<br /><br />The character of Juno immediately reminded me of the George Lass character from DEAD LIKE ME.  Teen girl with no direction or self-identity.  Unfortunately, George Lass had the opportunity to develop into a fascinating character over time.  Juno doesn't get that chance.<br /><br />I figured I had to like the film because of the supporting cast -- Jennifer Garner, J. K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney.  I love all of them.  The characters played by Simmons and Janney were the only ones in the film I cared about, and they have very little screen time.  I never had any motivation to care what happened with Jennifer Garner's character, or what was happening with Jason Bateman's character, either.<br /><br />Script-wise, I also felt the story went down a predictable path and never drew me totally into it.  While there is some clever dialogue in the film, the story itself never made me concerned for Juno, her baby, or her choices.<br /><br />So I guess my advice to the viewer is:  Don't believe the hype.  It's a cute enough movie, but I'd make it a rental rather than a purchase.
0786948523|3.0|Like all previous editions of the Monster Manual - this book contains the list of creatures and their statistics that DMs need to create opponents for their players.<br /><br />Before 3rd edition, this was all this book tried to do. While a 2nd edition DM could choose to buy the Fiend Folio instead of the Monster Manual, the 3rd edition (and 3.5) DM did not have this option. 3.0/3.5 added monster-specific rules that truly turned the Monster Manual into a core rulebook.<br /><br />Monster feats, exotic attacks, Templates, and rules for PC monsters - all were natural extensions of the monster concept: You have monsters - and now you want to alter them for your specific needs. In my opinion, this was a good thing.<br /><br />The 4th edition Manual follows this model - although there are some differences worth mentioning.<br /><br />First - the easy stuff:<br />The laundry list of monsters includes the bulk of classic D&D bad guys: Orcs, Unicorns, & Worgs (Oh my!). A straight book-to-book comparison will reveal many differences in this edition's inventory (e.g. 4th ed. has only chromatic Dragons).<br /><br />Many will be surprised by which creatures got included - but it's worth remembering that every edition of D&D has had multiple versions of the Monster Manual (3.5 was up to volume 5). If your favorite bad guy didn't make the cut - they're not gone - they'll just be in a future product.<br /><br />The creature entries seem abbreviated at first. Much as in 3.0/3.5 you will not see wordy paragraphs about a creature's back-story or preferred environment. As a DM, when I need a creature I need their stats, not their life story. Wordy write-ups take up space that could be filled by more monsters. Besides, adding thematic information like back stories is *my* job.<br /><br />Big changes in creature powers will come as a jolt. Negative levels are gone. 3rd edition negative levels seemed like a good idea - but were more hassle than they were worth. They had a high maintenance tail (keep track of your minuses AND then track a save the following day - for each negative level), and they threatened the primary goal of all players: level advancement. Good riddance.<br /><br />Undead now drain healing reserves - something that that is depleting (in keeping with the \\"drain life energy\\" motif of undead) and does not have a long term maintenance issue. When you are hit, you lose a reserve. Zero maintenance. This is good.<br /><br />Vampires - actually Vampire Lords - still create spawns but now ignore garlic, running water, and wooden stakes and have detailed rules for how they must rest. Jettisoning garlic may bother some players - but traits like that work better in novels than they do in RPGs (Bram Stoker never had to deal with PCs wearing plate mail festooned with garlic cloves).<br /><br />Werewolves don't spawn lycanthropy - they infect you a disease that makes you berserk. This change is likely due to the same calculation of maintenance hassle vs. gaming value. The first time you face werewolves - lycanthropy is a fun risk. When you face an army of lycanthropes, the disease adds more logistics than drama.<br /><br />There are a lot of monster abilities that will translate into the new rules in ways that surprise and confound. With 4th edition changing the DNA of spells and powers - this was unavoidable and does not pose any barrier to DMs adjusting the power of their chosen monster up or down.<br /><br />The rules for customizing monsters is where I would be most critical of this volume.<br /><br />The back of the book contains a subset of monsters that can be used for NPCs or PCs. This is essential, since 3.0/3.5 opened the doors for PCs to be whatever they want. The rules provided for playing a PC orc (for example) seem very light. There are a host of issues that playing monsters brought up in 3.5 - and I don't expect 4th edition to be any different.  This section looked a lot like an add on (and that's fine if it is), but if DMs should expect an expanded set of rules covering this - it'd be nice if the book came out and said it.<br />3.5's Monster Manual had \\"[this monster] as a PC\\" entries within the monster's description which I feel is a superior model. I want to be an orc, I pick up my Monster Manual and find the listing for - Orc. Putting them in the appendix helps the player who wants to see the full menu of choices - but you could do that with an index and still put all of a monster's data in one place. I'm a big believer in one stop shopping - and having the rules for a specific task stored in multiple places just slows things down.<br /><br />Scaling monsters/Adding templates.<br />Adding class levels and templates to 3.5 monsters ensured that no monster had to be boring (three words: Vampire Kobold Sorcerer) and from all appearances this will carry forward in 4th edition. These rules in 4th edition are in the DMG and I would question this.<br /><br />If the Monster Manual is truly a core book (the core set of monsters + monster rules) why not have all the template/advancement/ monster specific abilities rules in that volume?<br /><br />I can see that having these rules in a central book like the DMG is appealing - but when the rules for monsters evolve, we are more likely to get another Monster Manual than we are an updated DMG. The rules in the DMG are may be adequate, but they look rather thin. I would expect more rules and clarifications to be a virtual certainty. Plus, there's the appeal of having all my monster rules in one book.<br /><br />The changes in the 4th edition Monster Manual are extensions of the changes to the core rules - so it's hard to have stand-alone praise or criticism of it. For the most part, it remains what it always was: a menu of monsters that is essential for DMs.5's Monster Manual had \\"[this monster] as a PC\\" entries within the monster's description which I feel is a superior model.

B00151HZME|2.0|Last year, they were at the top of their game.. now we see with the release of Saturdays=Youth, M83 is more of a one trick pony, then the wunderkind band that we were supposed to believe they were... hey, it's a good solid album, but offers very little in depth from their previous releases.. I was really looking forward to growth and development, but even the samples (vocal bits, etc) were the same.. c'mon boys, get some more source material.. we already heard about the girl driving with her mom.. what comes next? We're patiently waiting..

Rothfuss does a great job spinning a complex story that keeps the reader engrossed in the book.  I enjoyed it from the first to the last page.  I would recomend this to anyone who wants to get out of the usual cookie cutter fantasy book.

And i got the feeling of motion sickness because of the camera always shaking around. you dont really get to enjoy the movie and cant get a handle on the whole story. it was a lot like the blair witch project. i would not recommend this movie to anyone. rent it if you really wanna see it. dont waste your money on this its not even worth the disc its burned on.
B0000025DI|5.0|I went in expecting to dislike Street Legal because I strongly believed, judging entirely by the way it sounds, that it was going to be a weak offering.  The first sign of a decline if you will.  Well the one thing I totally overlooked is the *lyrics*.  The lyrics are fantastic here!  A perfect follow-up to Desire.  Of course you have to look beyond the generic mid-tempo style and the unnecessary soulful female vocals that run through the entire album in order to truly appreciate what I believe is a mighty fine album.  This is one of those EXTREMELY rare cases where the lyrics are so great that I'm able to ignore what are obvious flaws with the female arrangements and the fluffy production.  The lyrics rule!<br /><br />\\"Changing of the Guards\\" has a somewhat optimistic vocal melody with Van Der Graaf Generator-like saxophone soloing (or Bruce Springsteen if you wish).  You know the more I hear this song, the more I believe THIS is the Bob Dylan tune that Tom Petty was most influenced by.  Just listen to Petty's early 90's stuff such as \\"Learning to Fly\\".  Same chugging rhythm and Dylan mannerisms.  Anyway \\"Changing of the Guards\\" is a surprisingly good song despite the obnoxious artificial production dragging down the atmosphere.  The lyrics are really wonderful and *definitely* help me to look beyond the way it sounds.  \\"New Pony\\" is slow groove blues.  I could do without the overbearingly repetitive \\"How much longer\\" gospel chorus though.<br /><br />\\"No Time to Think\\" is the best song on the album.  Why?  Well first of all, I SHOULD be criticizing it for the phony soulful female vocals and the plodding mid-tempo style but... I just can't bring myself to do that.  What makes the song work so well is the way Dylan mentions a variety of subjects and relates everything to there being \\"no time to think!\\" because of all sorts of distractions needlessly occupying our time.  An intelligent man Dylan is and here is your proof of that.  The man is a walking/talking dictionary!  \\"Baby Stop Crying\\" plods along generically and uninspiringly (wow, I've never realized how difficult it is to say the word \\"uninspiringly\\" until now, haha) and the soulful female chorus is unnecessary, and I could even go on and mention the saxophone solo at the end just makes it worse but... I can't help but love it anyway.  This is just unbelievable!  I should be ripping this album to shreds and calling it a sellout but I simply like it too darn much.  UGH!<br /><br />\\"Is Your Love In Vain\\" has melancholy horns during the intro and the vocal melody isn't very strong at all but it's decent enough.  I guess it serves a nice break after the lengthier songs before it.  \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\" is slow-paced but the vibes are positive.  Actually the atmosphere captures the feeling of someone at a crossroads and has that familiar optimistic sound that a few other songs here also illustrate.  \\"True Love Tends to Forget\\" has a fantastic chorus, oddly beautiful verse melody but of course, once again, the female vocals ruin a fun time by the way they frequently sing the \\"true love\\" line with Dylan.  That's not very appealing.  Seriously, did we need female vocals on EVERY song, Bob?<br /><br />\\"We Better Talk This Over\\" contains a snappy and effective verse melody that's actually awesome, and \\"Where Are You Tonight (Journey Through Dark Heat)\\" is actually nothing impressive or noteworthy compared to the rest of the material here, but the lyrics are really wonderful.  I haven't a clue what the message is behind these lyrics, however.  When you listen carefully, you might pick up on the fact the melody resembles the one from \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" but of course sounds significantly more modernized since this song/album came out in 1978 and \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" came out in '65.<br /><br />Overall, if you can ignore the female vocals that dominate every single song, you'll probably be happy with the lyrics which are a huge improvement over the ones from say, Planet Waves, Self Portrait and Nashville Skyline (not that I have a problem with that last album, but the other two?  Nah!).
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is about a research to discover how an ordinary company can make the transition from being good, to achieving breakthrough and becoming great.  He begins the book by describing the transition from good to great as a flywheel that consists of 3 stages of discipline with each stage containing 2 key concepts.  What's important to understand is that becoming a great company takes time; it is a slow build up process that takes disciplined people, disciplined thought, and disciplined action leading to breakthrough.  A great company does not become great overnight through a single defining miracle moment, savior, or revolutionary idea.    Jim Collins stresses the idea of Level 5 Leaders and having the right people on the bus, which is crucial to having a great company.  These concepts are discussed in the first stage of the process, which really makes one re-evaluate the type of companies that one would want to be associated with.  These first two ideas had me questioning my own personal work ethics, abilities, attitude, and overall character, hoping that I can be the right person on the bus and someday evolve into a Level 5 Leader.  It takes great people to make a great company, so the question is are you or can you be someone great?  The next stage of disciplined thought explains how one must confront the brutal facts of the current reality, you can't overcome obstacles or challenges unless you face them head on and have faith that you will prevail.  Once this has been accomplished, a clear understanding of what the company can be the best in the world at, what the people in the company can be deeply passionate about, and what drives the economic engine of the company should be addressed.  The intersection of these three ideas is what Collins calls the \\"hedgehog concept\\" and is another significant factor in becoming a great company.  Without this insight and understanding, the company has no direction or light to follow.  This stage is, in my opinion, the most difficult of this process.  It is probably where most companies get stuck and are not able to clearly grasp and understand what is their hedgehog concept.  The final stage is really just following through and having the discipline to make the right decisions and choices, by creating a \\"culture of discipline\\", which completely relies on the establishment of the first two stages.  This is the chapter that really brings all the concepts together and how to put it all into action.  The idea is not having to manage the people in the system, but rather managing the system itself.    Overall, this book was a very easy and intriguing read.  Collins does a great job at keeping the reader interested with the various examples and stories that he incorporates into the ideas that he is trying to get across.  He uses a lot of fascinating jargons or statements that really stuck in my mind such as \\"rinsing your cottage cheese.\\"  I believe the ideas that are presented in Good to Great can really open some people eyes and give better understanding of why we sometimes find ourselves dreading the idea of work at one company and excited about going to work at another.  On that note, I would highly recommend this book and leave you with a quote from Pablo Picasso, which was used, in the last chapter of the book, \\"It is your Work in life that is the ultimate seduction.\\"

Tolle talks a lot about Jesus in this book. it made what Jesus said really take on a new light. i recommend this book to everyone. but if you read it and don't get it or don't feel it holds some thing for you.. then as Tolle says in the book you are not ready to be awake. i bought the book for friends.. hoping they will get it. but as it says in the book that may not happen . if you want to read some thing that could  make you think differently about your life.. read this book.
B000O179EA|5.0|Now this was a really funny movie!  Not to mention features some incredibly good and ahead of their time special effects.  The ghosts are all very unusually and frighteningly charming, and the way they move around almost looks life-like at times.    The story is exciting and family friendly, and intended as a family comedy I believe (so the kids can watch it).  It probably has the same kind of zany storyline direction that the Back to the Future series did, but not quite as good as those movies (they were, and always will be, classics).      Just a total coincidence- I just checked out a Michael J. Fox website and found out I'm actually typing this review on the same day as his birthday.  He's 47 today!      Anyway, I highly recommend this very entertaining movie.

The action sometimes slows down, for a few seconds, then it's full on again, if you can cop bodies falling left right and center, then this is the movie  for you, if you love 007 style action sequences, all the time, then watch this, and enjoy.

B000050FEN|3.0|Seven was a bit of a disappointment to me.  While the actors are, of course, top notch (who actually dislikes Morgan Freeman?  You're a liar!) the actual storytelling in this movie left me feeling pretty bored and uninterested.      I would have liked more in the way of atmosphere, instead of one storyline bit carefully moving along at a pace that almost put me to sleep a couple times.      I understand most people like this movie, and that's perfectly fine with me, but it just wasn't good enough for me.  Maybe if I give the movie a second chance I'll like it more.  That's always a possibility.  Sometimes the second time finally makes something click.   Or maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it :)
B000002BFZ|5.0|I've got all the studio albums of Pearl Jam, Ten through the self-titled, and I believe that No Code is their best album artistically - musically and lyrically.    As the title of the review says, there really is \\"no code\\" to the songs here, in that they don't follow and particular formula or format, so they tend to song very different. They range from the crazy guitar of \\"Red Mosquito\\" to the soft, atmospheric sound of \\"Sometimes\\" and the first part of \\"Present Tense\\".     To not go on too long, I'll talk about the handful of songs on here that are my favorites:    Hail, Hail - quite a rocking and loud riff in this song, though the loud sections are interspersed by softer sections; should have been a hit, I think.    In My Tree - great rolling drumbeat in this one, as with \\"Who You Are\\" as well, and this song is why I would have loved for Jack Irons to stick around with the band a bit longer. Starts off with the drumbeat, Eddie's lyrics, and some prominent basswork, then takes off as the guitars cut in and the drums start to add some snares in. Great lyrical performance by Eddie Vedder in this one, he stretches his notes out very well, and even does some half-shouting that comes out well. The guitars in this song sound kind of like classic rock at some parts, and along with Eddie's singing, make the song one of the best on the album.    Smile - dirty and grungy rock riff with some harmonica thrown in; simply great and reminiscent classic rock. Another song where Eddie Vedder stretches out the notes very well.    Off He Goes - one of the ballads on the album, and another one that should have been a radio hit too. Some great soft and emotion-filled lyrics song here by Eddie Vedder that describe a person who's the kind that can never stay in one place for too long. Great acoustic guitar work on this song too, and the lyrics really remind me of their other songs dealing with realistic instances - such as Jeremy, Daughter, Indifference, and Better Man.     Habit - somegrowly and yelled lyrics by Eddie and a more aggressive guitar riff make this one of the more grunge sounding songs on the album. The lyrics sound to me like they're about drug addiction. I've read reviews that have said this CD doesn't rock as much as the earlier Pearl Jam ones, but I think it's still got plenty of rock in it - Hail Hail, Habit, Red Mosquito, and Mankind are about as hard as anything on on Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy.    Present Tense - this song's definitely a dichotomy, as it starts out slow and atmospheric with some sparse but good guitar work and softer lyrics by Eddie, but then the song picks up into a real jam. The lyrics have a good message about them: \\"makes much more sense to live in the present tense\\"; that it's not a good idea to live in the past or worry too much about the future, but it's better to live in the present. Some acoustic guitar slips in just before the tempo picks up. Probably the best lyrical performance of Eddie on this song.    Overall, this is a great album for any Pearl Jam fan, but I'd suggest getting into their more popular works like Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy (especially Vitalogy, due to its more experimental songs on it) to prep the unexperienced listener for this.

B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Madonna's latest studio album is like cotton candy: sweet and fluffy? I am a  big Madonna fan and have all of her cds. There are a few favorites on here like \\"Give it to Me,\\" \\"Miles Away,\\" and I really enjoy \\"4 Minutes.\\" Overall, a decent cd; however, not my favorite. I think she got it right with Confessions...and I'm not sure what I was expecting for this cd besides something amazing. Maybe next time, Madonna.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|Honestly, after reading the other reviews of this album I feel a little redundant. This album is just about perfect, easily on par with Necrophagist's \\"Epitaph\\", Nile's \\"Black Seeds of Vengance\\" and even, dare I blaspheme(?), Cryptopsy's \\"None So Vile\\". This album is the auditory equivalent of a prison raping by a meth addled sprinter. Yet it's catchy too.<br /><br />My only complaint, nitpick really, is the mixing of the vocals. They're too low in the mix, especially considering the amount of effort that appearantly went into them.<br /><br />9.8/10
B000007MVM|4.0|While there's certainly some good, \\"far out\\" psychedelic songs on the Madcap Laughs, it's actually a pretty mellow style of psychedelia compared to Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn album.  I guess this is to be expected from a solo album (after all, most solo albums released by a key band member connected to a distinctive rock band is basically just recreating the same kind of stuff that made them popular with their band, but with less interesting results- *usually* this is how it works).      Syd Barrett was trying hard to reach for some incredibly diverse styles on the Madcap Laughs, and while he succeeds for the most part (since it's easy to tell most of the songs apart) I'm not quite convinced he's the \\"master of psychedelic songwriting\\" that many people have been trying to convince me he is.      He's more like a solid musician with some exciting -though fairly inconsistent- musical ideas.  I think compared to the early period of Pink Floyd, only about half of this album stands in the same league.  Keep in mind I'm not a huge fan of early Pink Floyd like most people are, and also remember that the Madcap Laughs has the potential to become better with repeated listens.    At least most of the songs are short and sweet (except for \\"Terrapin\\" which should have been a couple minutes shorter).   It's a good song, but that vocal melody doesn't need to linger on *that* long.  At least the rest of the album contains relatively strong vocal melodies, some of which are better than early Pink Floyd, others a tad worse.  At least this album *sounds* like the Piper at the Gates of Dawn period of Pink Floyd.  That alone is a very good thing.    I can't deny this stuff was probably pretty darn incredible back in the late 60's when it first came out.  There wasn't anything like it back then.  It's hard to really fault this stuff- you either like your psychedelic pop music to sound like this, or you think it's horribly dated and too goofy to take seriously.  That's what madethe late 60's a special time period.

0783240236|4.0|After seeing The Birds again, including Hitchcock's tongue and cheek \\"lecture\\" in the trailer for the film, (1963) as one reviewer has written, it,s the suspense during those moments of silence between those unrelenting onslaughts of violence against their chosen rivals, human beings. The big question that is not answered in the film, is why the birds turn with such fury?<br /><br />Nature takes its revenge?<br /><br />Based on the short story by Daphne Du Maurier, Melanie Daniels (Tippy Hendren) chases a man she's smitten with to a small town outside San Francisco, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) when, slowly the birds begin to attack with a vengence: \\"Their coming, their coming!\\" screams Daniels, in the classic trailer with an expression of utter terror.<br /><br />What really makes the film is the silence of suspence between attacks. \\"Suspence\\" almost became Hitchcock's trademark, and The Birds is one of his best.<br /><br />It is well known that Hitchcock did not have a high regard for actors - he viewed them as merely pawns to tell his story. Tippy Hendren, it has been written somewhere caught the brunt of old Alfred's arrogance, but stuck with him for another great film, Marnie.<br /><br />Although not as subtle as some of the old Englishman's films, this is one of the Master's more memorable pictures of the 60's.

0440238609|5.0|For people wishing an alternative - for whatever reason - to the insanely popular \\"Harry Potter\\" fantasies (to which Philip Pullman's trilogy has been compared), Pullman's tale offers a bracing change. Here's why: even though it has very obvious fantasy elements such as magic and witches and talking bears, it doesn't fit the traditional mold of a fantasy because it draws upon scientific knowledge and theory, which pushes it into SF. However, like other good fantasy, Pullman's tale is also strongly interwoven in myth. Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" forms the basis of Pullman's overarching theme, woven by a rich fabric of setting and characters, each journeying toward their own sense of purpose and final destiny on this world. This is a book of great scope, unfolding, aptly, through the eyes of a child.<br /><br />Wrongly (I think) categorized by many as just a YA (young adult) fantasy, this SF-fantasy slipstream should appeal to readers of all ages. It is, after all, a multi-layered tale of universal scope. Pullman, himself, de-emphasizes the fantasy elements of his tale, calling it \\"stark realism\\" because these elements (such as daemons) are used to embody phycological truths about human personality. Say's Pullman, \\"I am trying to write a book about what it means to be human.\\" The coming-of-age of an intrepid girl and boy serves as an elegant metaphor to explore the story of everyman's journey toward enlightenment and whose every step comes with it a price. It brings to mind a quote by Victor Frankl: \\"What is to give light must endure burning.\\"<br /><br />Jordon College in Oxford is not an ordinary place for a girl; but then Lyra Belacqua is no ordinary girl, she can hear the hushed messages of truth uttered to her by the strange particles that animate her golden compass. Abandoned to the care of old scholars who know nothing about children, the little scamp runs wild through the streets of the university town, seeking adventure and not quite recognizing her yearning for \\"home\\" and love. She finds it - or it finds her - in the most unlikely place when she blunders into a vortex of danger, love, betrayal and intrigue. And it all begins with dust. Again, not just ordinary dust, but \\"magical\\" dust. Dust that provides a gateway to thousands of other worlds. . . .<br /><br />As our intrepid heroine journeys through a rich tapestry of worlds, she meets and recruits the services of an amazing variety of strange creatures in her quest to uncover more of the mystery of dust and the shattering truth of its role in her own destiny. Lyra journeys first to the far reaches of the north, where strange experiments are being conducted and where she meets the formidable armored bears. As she continues on to a mysterious tropical land, Lyra meets Wil, a young boy looking for his lost father, and together they flee the soul-eating Spectors who stalk the streets. Neither is aware that their destinies lie on a collision course with the otherworldly struggle of good and evil and that  their innocence will only be one of the casualties.<br /><br />Pullman spins imaginative and metaphorical worlds both familiar yet unfamiliar - giving us a strange but titillating sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. This is surely what phasing into another universe may well feel like. Pullman pulls off (pardon the pun) what few fantasy writers are capable of doing: he marries arcane SF with the lyrical elements of fantasy - the epic adventure of good vs. evil. He does this by using scientific facts and logical premises and weaves his heroic tale around them. For instance, the idea of parallel universes is not only old but very much in vogue with physicists these days. Check out the May 2003 issue of Scientific American for a good summary on this topic. While Pullman borrows His Dark Materials title from Milton, he also takes the concept of dark matter from real science. Dark matter is some form of matter theorized to exist that cannot be observed by radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, x-ray or gamma-ray telescopes and is theorized to be MACHOS, WIMPS, or GAS (see [...] for more info on this incredible particle).<br /><br />I suppose I was spell-bound by Pullman's imaginative worlds, his sensuous descriptions and his creatively bold use of scientific concepts but it was his complex and passionate characters who captured and still live in my heart. His main character, Lyra, has learned to spin the tallest tales to get by yet she possesses the most sincere and brave heart, and her interactions with her daemen (an alter-ego, part of her soul embodied in an animal bonded with her) are touching and humorous. It is her paradoxical combination of traits that makes her both charming and sweet: she is brave yet vulnerable; enveigling yet genuine; innocent yet crafty; naïve yet wise. She personifies the child in all of us, the child who must grow up and lose something to gain something else. So we laugh with her and we cry for her.<br /><br />The ending of the third book, which is bitter-sweet but provides excellent closure, leaves the reader - as all good fiction should - fulfilled yet drained, and wondering about both our own personal destinies and how we fit in with the larger questions of our universe. This is a must read for those seeking compelling adventure that does not compromise intelligence for action, character and setting for pace, heart for thrill, depth for speed; and imagination for story.nd is theorized to be MACHOS, WIMPS, or GAS (see [...] for more info on this incredible particle).

This collection includes some laugh-out-loud essays, and others that are touching and poignant. All are interesting and so original they are obviously taken from real life.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with him, Sedaris is the Dave Barry of the National Public Radio set. I've been a Sedaris fan for a long time through NPR's \\"This American Life.\\" This book is like a collection of the best of those quirky radio essays. (I also have [[ASIN:1600241824 the audio CD set,]] a 9-hour, 8-disc marathon that plays like an NPR fundraising marathon without those annoying pleas for cash.)<br /><br />The stories are filled with memorable characters. Irritated Becky, who sits next to Sedaris on a plane flight and inspires incorrect answers in Solution to Saturday's Puzzle. Gravel-voiced Helen, who lives next door to Sedaris and is the unlikely heroine of That's Amore. Sedaris' sister Amy, the owner of a magazine called New Animal Orgy in Town and Country. Woven throughout the essays is the fast-walking Hugh, Sedaris boyfriend, who demonstrates true love by lancing a boil in Old Faithful.<br /><br />Not all the essays are mass appeal (my husband, who is not a big NPR listener, hated the first one but loved the third) but I think there's plenty of good stuff in here to please just about any thoughtful adult reader. There is plenty of sex and language, however, so it's not for your pre-teen or Aunt Betsy. But for most anyone else who wants a good laugh, it's a must-read.

B00009ATIX|5.0|Steven Soderbergh's stylish psychological thriller, released November 2002 in the United States by 20th Century Fox , eloquently captures the theme of Stanislaw Lem's 1961 book. Written almost fifty years ago, \\"Solaris\\" is an intelligent, introspective drama of great depth and imagination that meditates on man's place in the universe and the mystery of God.<br /><br />Soderbergh's \\"Solaris\\" is a poem to Lem's prose. Both explore the universe around us and the universe within. Not particularly palatable to North America's multiplex crowd, eager for easily accessed answers, \\"Solaris\\" will appeal more to those with a more esoteric appreciation for art.<br /><br />When I saw the 2002 20th Century Fox remake of \\"Solaris\\" (released on DVD soon after), I was blissfully unaware of its legendary history. I say blissfully because I harbored no pre-conceived notions or expectations and therefore I was struck like a child viewing the Northern Lights for the first time. The stylish, evocative and dream-like imagery flowed to a surrealistic soundtrack by Cliff Martinez like the colors of a Salvadore Dali painting.<br /><br />It was only later that I discovered that Russian experimental director, Andrei Tarkovsky, had previously filmed \\"Solaris\\" in 1972 based on Stanislaw Len's masterful 1961 book of the same name. Reprinted by Harcourt, Inc. with a new cover featuring a sensual image from the 2002 film, the original book was translated in 1970 from the French version by Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox for Faber and Faber Ltd.<br /><br />Written almost fifty years ago, \\"Solaris\\" is a dark psychological drama. Soderbergh faithfully captures the intellectual yet sensual essense of Lem's book by tempering the language and movements. Featuring a fluid and haunting soundtrack, his film flows like a choregraphed ballet. There is a dream-like quality to the film that is enhanced by creative use of camera angles, unusual lighting, tones and contrast, and sparse language. \\"Solaris\\" is not an action film (no one gets shot, at least not on stage), yet the tension surges and builds to its irrevocable conclusion from frame to frame like a slow motion Tai Chi form.<br /><br />In response to his friend's plea, a depressed psychologist with the ironic name of Kris Kelvin (played with quiet depth by George Clooney), sets out on a mission to bring home the disfunctional crew of a research space station orbitting the distant planet, Solaris. Kelvin arrives at the space station, Prometheus, to find his friend, Gibarian, dead (by suicide) and a paranoid and disturbed crew, who are obviously withholding a terrible secret from him. It is not long before he learns the secret first hand: some unknown power (apparently the planet itself) taps into his mind and produces a solid corporeal version of his tortured longing: his beloved wife, Rheya (played sensitively by Natascha McElhone) who'd committed suicide years ago. Faced with a solid reminder, Kelvin yearns to reconcile with his guilt in his wife's death and struggles to understand the alien force manifested in the form of his wife. He learns that the other crew are equally influenced by Solaris and have been grappling, each in their own way, with their \\"demons,\\" psychologically trapping them there.<br /><br />Ironically, our hero's epic journey of great distance has only led him back to himself. The alien force defies Kelvin's efforts to understand its motives; whether it is benign, hostile, or even sentient. Kelvin has no common frame of reference to judge and therefore to react. This leaves him with what he thinks he does understand: that Rheya is a product of his own mind, his memories of her, and therefore a mirror of his deepest guilt ¯ but perhaps also an opportunity to redeem himself.<br /><br />Lem packs each page of his slim 204 page book with a wealth of intellectual introspection. Through first person narrative, he intimately unveils the complicated influence of this arcane force on Kelvin. Lem explains it this way: \\"I wanted to create a vision of a human encounter with something that certainly exists, in a mighty manner perhaps, but cannot be reduced to human concepts, ideas or images.\\"<br /><br />Such an incomprehensible entity would serve as a giant mirror for our own motives, yearnings and versions of reality. For me the contrast presented by such an arcane alien force emphatically -- but also ironically -- defines what it is to be human. It is only when faced with what we are not that we discover what we are. Later in the book, Kelvin cynically observes: \\"Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labrynth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed.\\" In the film Gibarian sadly proclaims of the Solaris mission: \\"We don't want other worlds - we want mirrors.\\"<br /><br />Lem's existentialist leaning is provided throughout the book and even alluded to in the name he chose for the space station: Prometheus. In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humankind for which Zeus chained him to a rock and sent an eagle to eat his liver (which grew back daily). It is interesting that Soderbergh chose to send Prometheus to a fiery crash and named Kelvin's dead wife, Rheya, after the Greek goddess, mother of Zeus and all Olympian gods. In a late passage of Lem's book, a devastated and sorrowful Kelvin formulates a personal theory of an imperfect god, \\"a god who has created clocks, but not the time they measure . . . a god whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose ¯ a god who simply is.\\"<br /><br />Soderbergh addresses Lem's existential vision with several brief but pivotal scenes. One occurs when Kelvin's dead friend, Gibarian, returns to him in a dream on Prometheus and responds to Kelvin's question, \\"What does Solaris want?\\" with: \\"Why do you think it has to want something?\\" Another scene occurs as a flashback to a dinner on Earth, when the real Rheya, prior to her suicide, argues with both Gibarian and her own husband about the existence of an all-knowing purposeful God, which both men argue is a myth made up by humankind: to Kelvin's suggestion that \\"the whole idea of God was dreamed up by man,\\" Rheya insists that she's \\"talking about a higher form of intelligence,\\" to which Gibarian cuts in with: \\"No, you're talking about a man in a white beard again. You are ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't.\\" Kelvin fuels it with: \\"we're a mathematical probability,\\" which prompts Rheya's challenge: \\"how do you explain that out of the billions of creatures on this planet we're the only ones conscious of our immortality?\\" Neither man has an answer. Gibarian later commits suicide on Solaris rather than deal with the manifestation of his conscience. And I can't help but wonder if the underlying reason for his inability to reconcile with his \\"demon\\" is because he was unequipped to, given his nihilistic beliefs.<br /><br />Gibarian also tells Kelvin (and we must remember that all this is Kelvin really saying this to himself through his memory of the character): \\"There are no answers, only choices.\\" It is interesting then that the first pivotal choice in the story is made by the doppelganger Rheya (also a manifestation of Solaris but a mirror of Kelvin's own mind) and it is a choice made out of love: to be annihilated, rather then serve as an instrument of this unknown alien power to study the man she loves.<br /><br />Some critics have called Soderbergh's \\"Solaris\\" pretentious, boring and devoid of action and intimacy. I strongly disagree. It is simply that, as with Lem's original story, Soderbergh's \\"Solaris\\" does not surrender its messages easily. The viewer, as with the reader, must intuitively feel his or her way through the fluid poetry, free to interpret and ponder the questions. This is what I think good art should do. And I feel both the original book and Soderbergh's movie do this with enthralling brilliance.<br /><br />Where Soderbergh and Lem depart lies more in each artist's personal vision and belief. We are defined by the questions we ask and Lem asks a great deal of questions. Whether the forces that drive our universe are best defined by current science and the mind as random without purpose or as the manifestation of arcane motive more readily known through spirituality and the heart is largely a matter of belief.<br /><br />Reviewer, Rick Kisonak, asserted that Lem's \\"novel is an icy meditation on man's place in the universe and the mystery of God. It poses countless metaphysical questions and makes a point of answering none of them. In Soderbergh's hands, however, `Solaris' becomes a celebration of romantic love, which culminates in the revelation of a caring, forgiving creator. At the end of his book, Lem writes [Kelvin ponders]: `the age-old faith of lovers and poets in the power of love, stronger than death, that finis vitae sed non amoris [life ends but not love] is a lie, useless and not even funny.' The director ignores the author in favor of just such a poet.\\" Kisonak is referring here to Rheya's interest in Dylan Thomas and its reference throughout the movie. Another reviewer, Dennis Morton, goes so far as to suggest that the screenplay of \\"Solaris\\" is the first stanza of the poem, which ends with: \\"...though lovers be lost love shall not; And death shall have no dominion.\\"<br /><br />While I agree with some of Kisonak's reasoning, I think he has missed the point of Lem's book. If one continues to read from the passage Kisonak quoted above ¯ as Kris Kelvin transcends from what he \\"thinks\\" in his intellect to what he feels and \\"knows\\" in his heart, to accept his (and humanity's) destiny with humble fatalism ¯ we learn that Lem ends his book in much the same way as Soderbergh's movie: life ends but not love. The endings are physically different, in keeping with some radical alterations from the book in the movie's setting (e.g., the original Solaris station is located on the planet and Lem assiduously describes Kelvin's observations and interactions with the alien ocean; whereas Soderbergh's crew virtually never leave orbit and the planet remains aloof in the background, reflecting Soderbergh's focus). Yet, Kris makes the same choice in faith and love in both book and movie (although the choices play out differently).<br /><br />In matters of faith and love, here is what Kris has to say in the book: \\"Must I go on living here then, among the objects we both had touched, in the air she had breathed? . . . In the hope of her return? I hoped for nothing. And yet I lived in expectation . . . I did not know what achievements, what mockery, even what tortures still awaited me. I knew nothing, and I persisted in the faith that the time of cruel miracles was not past.\\" In the end of both movie and book, Kris Kelvin lets go of his fears and lets his spirit rise in wonder at what astonishing things Solaris (and the universe) will offer next.<br /><br />In the final analysis, both book and movie are incredibly valuable but for different reasons. Soderbergh paints an impressionistic poem, using Kafkaesque brushstrokes on a simpler canvas, to Lem's complex tapestry of multi-level prose. Lem challenges us far more by refusing to impose his personal views, where Soderbergh lets us glimpse his hopeful vision. I think that both, though, come to the same conclusion about the ethereal, mysterious and eternal nature of love.<br />On the one hand, love may connect us within a fractal autopoietic network to the infinity of the inner and outer universe, uniting us with God and His purpose in a collaboration of faith. On the other hand, love may empower us to accept our place in a vast unknowable and amoral universe to form an island of hope in a purposeless sea of indifference.<br /><br />Whether love mends our souls to the fabric of our destiny; enslaves us on an impossible journey of desperate yearning; or seizes us in a strangling embrace of unspeakable terror at what lurks within ¯ surely, then, love IS God, in all its possible manifestations.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|I lived through the seventies and saw more than my share of \\"grindhouse\\" movies at our local drive-in.  \\"Death Proof\\" bills itself as an homage to those sometimes campy, sometimes scary, sometimes just plain god-awful films that kept us juvenilles entertained through countless six-packs of ill-gotten brew.  \\"Messiah of Evil\\", \\"The Student Nurses\\", \\"Six Pack Annie\\"--these are just a few titles that I remember with more affection than they probably deserve.  However, \\"Death Proof\\" is less an homage, than a ham-handed, self-indulgent ripoff of the genre from Quentin Tarantino, a director whose films have grown steadily worse since his halcyon days of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", and \\"Jackie Brown\\".  The \\"Kill Bill\\" films, despite great performances from a stellar cast, were ludicrous, overlong, and, eventually, tiresome.  \\"Death Proof\\" is just plain boring, loaded with so much inane and profane banter between some of the least interesting characters imagineable, that it becomes unwatchable.  I forced myself to sit through it just to make sure I was clear on what I was seeing.  Then, I wanted to throw the DVD into the garbage, where it belongs. Kurt Russell apparently needed a paycheck as he non-acts his way through the poorly conceived role of a stuntman/psycho who hotrods around in his souped up auto, stalking scantily clad cuties who spout dialogue that would insult the intelligence of any average seventh grader. Rose MacGowan, Jordan Ladd, and Rosario Dawson are among the female cast whose talents are completely wasted in this inept mess.  The worst movie I've seen this year, possibly in this decade.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Sometimes I have to turn off this album because it's too just to good to take. The ten year wait was well worth it. The songs are a bit more grown up than the previous albums, as they should be, and aren't quite as accessible as the first two albums. You won't necessarily get up and dance, you may need a few listens of a song before it really seeps into you, but if you've been growing and developing over the ten years since their last release (and, hey, I hope and expect you have) then you're right on par to accept these more sophisticated songs.<br /><br />The tone is as melancholy as ever, but a bit more cerebral than the previous stuff, with lyrical nuance that will haunt you long after you've turned it off. The content is a bit more abstract and and poetic than cynically romantic. You get the sense that the musicians are more concerned with the current state of the world than their last tryst. And we agree with them.<br /><br />There is a great range on this record- some songs are just dreamy vocals, some take on sounds that are totally new to the band-stripped down and folksy, and then there's the beat-driven sonic passion where the singular and powerful rhythm overwhelms in a good way.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Portishead, there's no way you should hesitate to buy this album. If you're only gonna legally purchase one album this year, this should be it, IMHO.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|This album shows the different varieties that the Killers have under their belt. Romeo and Juliet is reminicent of Bob Dylan, Shadowplay kind of sounds like She Wants Revenge (although I see the music video in my head every single time I hear this song)and an interesting remake of their hit song Mr. Brightside. I almost believe that this album should have been a major release. Flowers is the new Freddy Mercury, minus the jock jams.<br /><br />I'd buy it again.

0307346617|5.0|Honestly, I don't know what to say about this book other than it scared the crap out of me. The Zombies of this story could be replaced by anything a super bug, bird flu and any enemy; it would still apply. Each short story is told from a specific person's point of view, which I really enjoyed. I hope that the author writes more on this subject!!

It is a must for a Ramones fan.<br />Having seen the Ramones many times throughout the years, this video has stuff I never saw before.<br />I had to have this in my collection and wasn't disappointed.

0321525655|4.0|Based on other reviews I thought I would eitehr love this book or hate. It would either be a great source of insights on presenting or a jargon-laden book that could best be described as \\"clever.\\"  Thankfully, it is the former.     Presentation Zen presents a philosophy on presenting rather than a rule book on what each slide should look like (since that will vary based on what you're presenting).  And while I was doubtful up front (as you can tell above), the book is very engaging and, with each chapter, you can viaualize how what he is saying will make for better presentations.  Of course the essence of what he is saying is pretty simple - communicate clearly and think of your audience- but he speaks clearly about why some of the things we have done for years which seem like they are doing that really are not. Bullet-riddled slides may convey a lot of information, but they are not communicating well or really thinking about your audience.  Just putting a report in landscape mode or in PowerPoint does not make it a presentation.     As the title says this book has \\"simple ideas on presentation design and delivery\\" which will be immediately useful to anyone with an open-mind about changing what we have been doing to our audiences until this point.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|I once had an argument with some friends who detested The Beatles.  I love them - even an earlier, deceptively simple song like 'Please Please Me' is sheer melodic genius.  These friends thought their 'argument winner' was \\"Ok...what about 'Ob La Di, Ob La Da' then, huh?!\\".      Hmmm... 'Inland Empire' is David Lynch's 'Ob La Di, Ob La Da' - lousy output from a very fine artist.  I loved the intrigue of 'Lost Highway', and 'Mulholland Drive' still haunts me.  But with 'Inland Empire' the riddles and twists left me absolutely cold.  The Lynch ingredients are there but the cake just doesn't rise.  I guess it's what can happen when the usual budgetary constraints of film-making are lessened to a large degree by the opportunity to shoot digitally.  Discipline and restraint can go out the window as the director gets carried away with his new-found 'freedom'.    Quite liked the rabbit sitcom though.... One star for that.

B0010VD7EO|4.0|Drenched in addictive hooks that marry Prince and The Flaming Lips in a union of space-funk and soul that somehow captures exactly the sound the band describes on their MySpace page-\\"surf jungle country\\"-Oracular delivers a sound that's as fresh in 2008 as Beck's was in 1994, leaping onto the scene with the same \\"we don't care\\" abandon that \\"Loser\\" brought to the biz back then. It's no accident that the album vaguely echoes The Flaming Lips. Oracular IS produced, after all, by David Fridmann, the captain at the console for many a Flaming Lips album. Roll Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots with some Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and you've got the narcotic sunrise of the mind that is Oracular Spectacular.<br /><br />Apart from their music, though, what's refreshing about Ben and Andrew is their indifference to the punk-rock disdain for corporate influence that has itself become one of the cliches they expose, claiming instead to have \\"talked a lot about selling out as soon as possible\\" before anyone but their buddies knew who they were. Touch&eacute;! Nonetheless, here's to hoping that next year's Grammy Awards completely ignore this masterpiece deserving of universal adoration, a neglect that has become a seal of approval for bands too good to be caught on TV with Brittney and Beyonce-and let's hope it stays that way, for the sake of both the band and their growing number of fans.<br /><br />Visit my blog culturespill.com

B0013K6WLM|5.0|A lot of people are saying that this album is too \\"polished\\" for a Black Keys project; but I don't hear the \\"polish,\\" I hear genius. While tracks like \\"I Got Mine\\" or \\"Strange Times\\" deliver exactly the kind of scorching \\"attack\\" the title promises, it's in the album's departures from that familiar terrain that its vision achieves the range of true rock pioneers. The lilting twang and echo of \\"So He Won't Break\\" vaguely echoes some great lost gem by surf-rock gods The Ventures, a flutter of piano and xylophone (yes, xylophone) dressing Auerbach's dreamy licks in a rich jewelery of sound. The acoustic and countrified \\"All You Ever Wanted\\" exudes the effortless mojo of rock staples like \\"Sway\\" or \\"Torn & Frayed,\\" and the album closes with an absolutely devastating ballad, \\"Things Ain't Like They Used to Be,\\" a spare and hypnotic gut-wrencher that's bound to show up again on year-end \\"Top Ten Songs of 2008' lists.<br /><br />This ain't your mother's rock `n roll-or, then again, maybe it is-and maybe that's why it sounds so fresh. Rock `n roll hasn't sounded this real since the night Keith Richards woke up in a hotel in Clearwater and recorded what he heard in his dreams-the riff that became \\"Satisfaction.\\" But the point is that Attack & Release embodies as much of the spirit as the soul of rock `n roll, pausing for a slow jam and unplugging the amps whenever the urge strikes, producing work that's as compelling as any driving rocker the Keys have ever put to wax.<br /><br />Rubber Soul laid the groundwork for this expansion of the band's sound, exploding with the belch and wail of an acoustic guitar (\\"When the Lights Go Out\\") that picked up where their idol and bonafide blues god Junior Kimbrough left off. It's no wonder that not even Kimbrough's own widow, Mildred, was surprised when The Black Keys released their neglected but brilliant 6-track EP of electric Kimbrough covers, Chulahoma, an album she endorsed in a recorded telephone call the Keys included on the EP itself (keep listening after the last track.) The unfocused but sporadically entertaining Magic Potion continued this nod to experimentation with the mildly psychedelic \\"You're the One,\\" a ballad in which you can almost hear the echo of Tommy James's \\"Crimson & Clover\\" somewhere in the distance. But only now have those glimpses of a broader sound blossomed into the full fruit of Attack and Release, the best rock album 2008 is yet to produce, bar none.<br /><br />Visit my blog, culturespull.comning after the last track.)

B000OVLBGC|5.0|I could not be happier with this film!  Without any expectations, I found myself completely enveloped by this film, enraptured at the edge of my seat until the credits started to roll (and then how disappointed that it was all over!).<br /><br />Ulrich Muhe was excellent as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler.  The evolution of his interest and involvement in the lives of his subjects is so interesting.  It is a slow paced film, but all the details flow rapidly making this film irresistible once you have started watching.<br /><br />Although sad and heart breaking at parts, I thought this film was beautiful.  The compassion and love humans can show to people is astounding--especially given the bleak setting for this story, it is even more astounding.<br /><br />This is a must see for anyone interested in cold war politics, oppressive governments, post-war Germany, or those interested in a film about the complexities of the human spirit and the ability to overcome external oppression.  Highly recommend.
B00006LSM3|4.0|This is my 4th favorite George effort.  I rate Cloud 9 #1; All things must pass #2; George Harrison #3.  I so wish George was still with us.  He was at his prime when he did Cloud 9 and was part of the Traveling Wilbury's.  Love you George and miss you
0060764899|5.0|This is a wonderful novel. CS Lewis tells a tale of love and redemption in the land of Narnia. The four Pevensie children wander through a wardrobe into the winterland of Narnia, and discover that the curse of the Witch has made for perpetual winter. And younger brother Edmund is seduced by the power of the witch.    But the Pevensie children, along with their faithful friends, turn to Aslan, Lord of the Wood for help. Aslan ends up dying for Edmund's sin of betrayal, but he comes back to life to conquer the evil witch and her army.    For the most part, if you've seen the film, you'll see that it did a pretty good job of following the novel, with a few exceptions. It is an allegory of the redemption Christ won for us on the cross and of his victory over Satan, the witch of this world.    Highly recommended.

B000QEIORG|5.0|I didn't know this version of Colour came out until I got here. Kind of sucks for us folks who plunked down $50 or more back in 1997 and 1998 for the original Colour, both X-Files soundtracks, Godzilla soundtrack and a couple of foreign Colour single CD's just to get the B-sides.      Oh wait...A320 from Godzilla isn't on here, nor is Walking After You Remix that's on the X-Files movie soundtrack.  Where, oh where are those two great pieces of Foo work from the Colour & Shape era on this 10th year edition?      But, I digress slightly.  If you don't have C&S and you've got latter Foo stuff like In Your Honor or Echoes/Silence, you should pick up this 10th anniversary edition.  It's the perfect mixture of the first super rocking Grohl solo project (Foo Fighters 1995) and it's sleepy and warm Nothing Left To Lose.  Lots of the elements you hear on Echoes or Honor is quite prevelent on Colour & Shape, albeit Colour & Shape is years before the aforementioned.      One thing I do hope this 10 year edition didn't get and that is the loudness treatment because Colour & Shape is one serious hodge-podge of the loud-quiet thing that benefited Foo so well at the time; carrying it on over from Grohl's Nirvana days.  Having Doll sound as just loud as February Stars' awesome ending fuzz pedal soup would be a total disservice to the original album.  But, given Gil Norton's good production skills on Colour and others, it's possible that he didn't do that.  Again, I'm hoping.
0515141429|4.0|I admit that I am completely hooked--at two books including this one in--but this is pretty cartoonish stuff.  Still I like Rambo, Die Hard, and, especially, 24, so no reason I should not like this.  The hero is a superman and he seems to get the girls, and he lives by his own code as a loner.  Cliches gone wild, but still pretty compelling reading.  Ultraviolent.  Our hero does not spend much time worrying about killing bad guys and he is good at it.  The bad guys are all evil and two dimensional.  Does anyone that is not American read this kind of thing I wonder?  Probably.  24 is popular everywhere.  I prefer Michael Connelly, but have blazed through nearly everthing he has written.  This will do in the meantime and is very addictive, if not as well written as MC.  I'll give it a very solid 4, for those that like this kind of stuff.
006113399X|5.0|Bouncing back and forth between WW2 and 2000, Nesbo develops a story that has more turns than the coast of Norway.  He even manages to kill off what had appeared to be a major character without damaging the book or story.      When you read a translation, you always wonder about how much the translator cleared up misconceptions and other little mistakes that show up in the original.  There is also the danger that you will lose many of the 'quirks' that make up the characters.  None of that happens in the hands of Don Bartlett who should be commended for a great job.  (A friend of mine read the original in Norwegian and said that he was amazed at how closely the english version had the same 'feel'.)    The story is way to complicated to define in just a few sentences and can only be described as constantly moving along.  The only sad part of this book is that it is the THIRD installment of the series and the first two have still not been translated.  Parts of those stories are mentioned in the narrative and will probably spoil the endings of both.      Be warned that this was the second book translated, and the third \\"Nemesis\\" is actually the next installment (the fourth book) and that \\"The Devil's Star\\" the first book translated, is actually the fifth installment.  The publishers should be ashamed of themselves as should Nesbo's agent.
B0017V7GLC|5.0|Before I got this album I decided to read several customer reviews to get an idea of what to expect. I noticed that many people said that this album was one of, if not the best CD that Ladytron has ever put out. After listening through the album several times I realized that this is hands down the best album that they have ever put together. From the first track (Black Cat) you are immediately pulled in and hooked. Nowadays too many artists put out albums that have many good tracks with several other mediocre tracks thrown in. Not the case with this album. From start to finish every track has a unique sound that is very different from anything that I heard on Witching Hour. I think that Ladytron finally has the chance to achieve mainstream success with this album. Mira's vocals in Bulgarian are haunting, sexy, and beautiful all at the same time. The deep synths and strong bass are everything that I love about Ladytron. They definitely don't fail to impress on  Velocifero.  Top 5 Tracks:  1) Black Cat  2) Runaway  3) Tomorrow  4) Deep Blue  5) Ghosts

0307265730|5.0|This is the best to date of Lahiri's books and the jacket blurb saying she displays \\"emotional wisdom\\" is descriptive of her talent. She has been unfairly criticized for the sameness of her settings and characters which focus on the Bengali immigrant experience. That is like criticizing Hemingway for writing about men facing adversity in war or on hunting or fishing expeditions.  Lahiri writes with a transparency that is the epitome of style. Her books truly touch the reader's heart.
0596527055|5.0|What I liked about this book is its simplicity, and the organized way of presenting ideas. This book contains a lot of information about what is wrong about innovation, as well as the right way to do things.    If you like to think \\"out of the box\\", and find solutions out of the norm, this book is definitely for you...
0321344758|5.0|A staple book that has standardized so many design and usability concepts. It isn't that long, but it is so dead-on with usability that this as close to the the Bible you can get for web usability. Full color pages and tons of practical examples make it easy to associate with problems many regular people face. Web interfaces should be mind-numbingly simple and functionality should always take precedence over aesthetics. Worth reading every couple of years to reconnect to the core foundation of what websites are REALLY about. My highest possible rating.
B000063DHL|5.0|I originally bought the audio cassette of this when it was released in 1986, and bought the CD just recently. This is an excellent release from Iron Maiden, and to me the last of the really good ones they recorded in the 80s.  To me there are no weak tracks on the disc. Probably all Maiden recordings will be judged against \\"Number of the Beast\\" and \\"Piece of Mind\\", but I believe this one stands out on its own.
0061120073|5.0|To all the one star reviewers out there complaining about the tedious details in the book. Betty Smiths gift for detail is what makes the book so wonderful. I was fascinated with this book as a kid. I even tried to recreate the stale bread cutlets with ketchup sauce that Mama Nolan made!To this day, if I find a book about turn of the century NY tenements I will stop everything to read it. I've had a copy of ATGIB for 30 years now and I don't think I've ever gone a year without rereading it. Now I need to buy a new copy as my treasured copy (with illustrations!) has become lost. I hope whoever finds it enjoys it as much as I did.
B000MXPE74|5.0|Awesome album!  Loud, fun and fast - makes you want to get up and go!  No fillers - every song is a winner.  Flavors of The Kinks, T-Rex, Elton John, The Clash and Stray Cats.  John Lennon sounding lead vocals and Beatles-ish harmony.  Buy it!!
0596009208|4.0|I'll admit it... I'm a huge fan of the Head First series. This is the third I own and at least two others (currently unreleased) are on my to-buy list just waiting for their release. The style of Head First books in general is fantastic and helps things make sense right away. That being said, I was a bit disappointed in certain aspects of Head First Java. Make no mistake, I still heartily recommend it, but it was not as good as it could have been.<br /><br />Frankly, the only specific identifiable element that I disliked was the crossword puzzles. Now, I LOVE the crossword puzzles in other Head First books. In fact, they're one of my favorite elements in the Head First equation. However, the crosswords in Head First Java were lacking, often with strange \\"hints\\" that were more confusing than helping. Examples: \\"can't pin it down\\", \\"dept. of LAN jockeys\\", and \\"Pi house\\".<br /><br />Additionally, the overall feel of the book was inferior to the previous two I've read (Head First C# and Head First SQL). Unfortunately, I can't articulate exactly what the difference is, but it just wasn't as engrossing as the others.<br /><br />In the end, I do recommend the book. It is a fine-quality product. However, do not use this as a prime example of the Head First series -- it is not their best.
B0002EXH40|5.0|I bought this back when it was originally released, but over the last few years I had forgotten about it. I rediscovered my old audio cassette copy of this recently and I decided to get the CD. I had forgotten what a great release this was. It's an excellent list of songs, and the bonus tracks make it that much better. Songs like \\"Train of Consequences\\" and \\"Victory\\" showcase what Megadeth has always been about, but \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" shows that Megadeth is far from one-dimensional. This CD should be in every Megadeth fan's collection.
0385338724|2.0|To say the least, I was dissapointed with Remember Me? While I knew I wanted to finish it just to see how it ended, part of me really didn't care all that much. The main character was rather stereotypical to the Chic-Lit genre: stupid, materialistic, wild about dancing, obsessed with cocktails, etc etc. And even besides her, there were no lovable characters throughout the whole story. Not to mention the plot was fairly unrealistic. I just kept thinking \\"Back to the Future\\" the entire time rather than amnesia-stricken woman.<br /><br />Remember Me? is about Lexi, a girl who got into a car accident at 28 years old and awoke to find the last three years of her life completely missing from her memory. Not only that, but her life has completely turned around. Lexi finds out that she is married to a rich and handsome man (go figure), finally has a driver's license, is two sizes smaller (due to a strict \\"no carb\\" diet), has new (and even more shallow) friends, and is a very important figure at her previous company making the big bucks. Everything, in a nutshell, is perfect when she first wakes up.<br /><br />BUT THEN<br /><br />...she finds out nothing is as it seems. Her marriage sucks, her best friend hates her, her little sister is a crazy juvenile delinquent, and she's not allowed to eat any toast or chocolate.<br /><br />What really does this book in is the unrealistic plot and lack of likable characters. These two factors together make it difficult to put a whole heart into reading it. I did finish it quickly, however. Due to its high demand at the library, I decided to read and return it ASAP for the next sucker who wanted to check it out.<br /><br />On the bright side, Remember Me? is some what entertaining and not entirely predictable (though partially). It's also light and fast - just like a good beach read oughta be. So while it itsn't that bad, it isn't that good either. It's sort of a hit or miss. So you could take your chances... or not.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|\\"....what's a Dirt Harry Collection if it's not \\"fully loaded\\"? Enjoy.\\"<br />Those are the words of Clint Eastwood himself on a card enclosed with this beautiful set that, so far for me,is the best DVD release of this year.\\"Fully loaded\\" is an understatement.I have never seen such a set like this from a big major studio that has so many extras included;not only on the DVDs themselves but with some eye popping extras packaged with the DVDs.<br />Let's take a look at what you're going to get.<br />First of all are all five of the franchise movies on DVD.All are beatifuuly remastered in sound and picture I have never seen them looking as clean and crisp as these prints are.WB obviously took extra care in their transfers here and it shows.The highest marks for the technical team responsible.All discs are one sided which I prefer over the double sided discs which are SO prone to scratching.There are seven discs in all,five for the movies each with documentaries old and new,an \\"extras\\" disc devoted to Dirty Harry, and the seventh an 87 min. documentary on Mr.Eastwood called \\"Out of the Shadows\\",narrated by Morgan Freeman.<br />The discs for the movies are in two seperate fold-out type holders.All sit quite firmly in each holder.The documentary sits in a seperate booklet type holder and that is enclosed within a little treasure chest of a box also in this set.What is in this box really got my adrenaline going,as it will you I'm sure.Along with the docu disc are:<br />1)A personal message from Clint Eastwood.<br />2) a huge fold out colour map called\\"Scorpio:Portrait of a Killer\\".It details the various locations throughout San Francisco where Inspector Callahan had his various run-ins with Scorpio and his utlimate demise.<br />3)Eight 5\\"x7\\" pieces of rare Malpaso and Warner Bros. correspondance<br />4)Six 5\\"x7\\" colour promotional cards,five of which are repro theatrical posters for each movie.The sixth is a collage card.These all sit safely in an onion paper envelope.<br />5)my favourite,a reproduction of Harrys' police badge and I.D.in its'holder.<br />As if this wasn't enough,to top this phenomenal collection off is sepia-tinted 43 page hard-cover booklet filled with lots of pictures and facts about each of the films.<br />The entire lot is packaged into a large slipcase cover,which is embossed with Harrys' revolving magazine chamber on the outside.<br />This is a dream package of one whose likes I have never seen before and<br />any fan of the Dirty Harry franchise or Mr.Eastwoods' career should not be without.<br />About the films themselves each and every one,to me at least,is filmaking of the highest standard.I can't say there is one for me that is much better than the other,but everyone will certainly have their favourites.I have always been a fan of Mr.Eastwood from his gritty thriller \\"Play Misty for Me\\" right up until today.But with \\"Dirty Harry\\" I saw something special in this man's work and I have really marvelled at his subsequent films since and the maturity that each successive one has shown.The critics were not always kind to him but the public rarely failed him and that after all is what really counts in the end.<br />A case in point is the first film in this set,\\"Dirty Harry\\".A smash at the box office but some so-called \\"critics\\" were all over this one even berating it,if my memory serves me correctly,as a piece of right wing propaganda!? For some reason they saw the character as some kind of fascist bent on killing anything that didn't measure up to his standard of right and wrong.He was described as a rogue cop,a loose cannon,you name it.<br />First of all any \\"critic\\" who would go so far as to analyse a movie like this,or any movie,to that degree isn't doing their job at all.<br />Secondly I never saw Harry as a rogue cop let alone a fascist.My take was that Harry was certainly a disenfranchised person/cop.His wife had died by a drunk driver and he was constantly at odds with the justice system and his own bosseswho didn't seem either to \\"get\\" what he was about or see that the victims had rights as well as the criminals in a very faulty system.His character is really defined in the second movie \\"Magnum Force\\".He says that he \\"hates the system\\" but until something better comes along that he will work within it.There is obviously a line even Harry won't cross and despite what many superiors and even peers think,he knows the difference between right and wrong;probably better than they do.<br />Furthermore when these \\"critics\\" analyse movies like this to such a distorted degree they seem to lose all sight of what they are looking at.And that is just that this is a movie.It is fiction,not fact.I doubt if in reality there are any cops like Harry.If there are or have been they wouldn't have lasted a day let alone years.No policeman would go chasing after suspects alone like Harry does throughout these films.In reality if a cop suspected the wherabouts of a criminal he would immediately call for back up.But Harry Callahan calling for backup,waiting,surrounding the perp then arresting him/her evertytime, would make for a dull movie wouldn't it? That's why this fictional character is written to do what he does.For entertainment value,nothing else.That is all these movies are and will ever be,though excellent ones at that.What little I know of Mr.Eastwood I would think that the only thing on his mind when making these pictures was how to do the best job he could and then move on to the next project;not what deep meaning or message he could incorporate into them like some \\"critics\\" seem to find.<br />In conclusion,for all fans of Mr.Eastwood and /or the Dirty Harry franchise,this collection as recently released by Warners is the definitive must have of your collection.The myriad of exciting extras alone are worth the price,but as is,they are just nice icing on the cake that is the essence of this package:all five Dirty Harry movies.Each have been restored and remastered to perfection in beautiful widescreen format.You will never have seen these movies as good as they look today.<br />Thank you Warner Brothers and above all to Mr.Clint Eastwood.<br />Get your copy today!ctims had rights as well as the criminals in a very faulty system.His character is really defined in the second movie \\"Magnum Force\\".He says that he \\"hates the system\\" but until something better comes along that he will work within it.There is obviously a line even Harry won't cross and despite what many superiors and even peers think,he knows the difference between right and wrong;probably better than they do.

B000A6T1JU|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie, although I seriously doubt if street gangs have ever been so unintentionally humorous. Compared to the reality of what street gangs do, these gangs seem more like contestants for a reality show. That is not a slam on the movie, I believe the movie was just a sign of the times. It's a shame Michael Beck didn't get better roles after this film, although I've read that his casting in the absolute stinker \\"Xanadu\\" may have seriously derailed his career. Still, I think he's great as the impromptu leader of the representatives of the Warrior gang. Overall I think this is a fun movie. The words \\"fun\\" and \\"street gang\\" usually don't belong  in the same sentence, but this movie is purely entertaining.
B00005JPS7|5.0|What makes Iron Man a great movie is that it is virtually void of those moments where you go, \\"That could never happen.\\" And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an \\"iron\\" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but also gives Tony Stark the ability to fly.<br /><br />I've seen comparisons between the detail and...well...just plain awesomeness that was abundant in [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]] and Iron Man. And that comparison would not be incorrect. While I'd agree that both had great action and made viewers believe that these superheros actually existed, Batman Begins was more dark while Iron Man kept you giggling at Tony Stark's wise-guy personality...which is true to the comic book versions of the characters.<br /><br />And who better to be in the role of a wise-guy than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark! And the rest of the cast and acting in the movie were terrific.<br /><br />Iron Man takes you from Stark's creation of the gold-titanium-alloy suit to his confrontation with those that would see Stark Industries commit treason. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing will probably put Jon Favreau in the sought-after category.<br /><br />The good news is that Iron Man will be back, but in what capacity is the question. It's well known that Stark (Downey, Jr) has a cameo in 2008's [[ASIN:B00164DWEA The Incredible Hulk]]. And it's rumored that the actors in Iron Man have all signed on for two sequels (at the time of this writing Director Favreau has not). But will Iron Man's return be solo, or perhaps with some of his [[ASIN:0785110828 Avenging]] buddies? Either way...I can't wait.<br /><br />I will definitely pick up Iron Man for my collection. I don't know about the theaters in your area, but the theaters in mine don't even come close to the picture and sound quality that I get from my home theater. I'm not bragging; I'm just saying that [[ASIN:B00168ML1G Iron Man]] will be a movie that goes into my Blu Ray player the day it's released.ovie that goes into my Blu Ray player the day it's released.
B000FILW86|4.0|I bought Rockford on somewhat of a whim after seeing them perform \\"Perfect Stranger\\" on Conan O'Brien's show and then noticing that I could pick up this new album for a mere $9 at the local Wal-Mart.<br /><br />I really really liked it and soon bought their first four albums, a Greatest Hits and At Budokan.<br /><br />I don't know how their music fared in the 80's and 90's (though I'm told its not so hot), but this album sounds just as good to these ears as those great albums from the 70's.  Plenty of loud guitars, good melodies, and a ton of energy (these guys sound way more vibrant than most bands 30 years into their career).  Plus, unlike some of those overly-glossy 70's albums, Rockfords production really lets the band kick it loud and proud.<br /><br />Fans should be happy with these catchy loud rock songs, and folks new to Cheap Trick will probably find this album to be so good that they just might want more (I know I did!).
1416524800|5.0|This was such a good book!!!  I stopped doing my usual routine to read this book, because it was so interesting.  It has all the levels of a great book (for me) romance, mystery, drama, ACTION, and comedy.  I really enjoyed it and if you liked the Da Vinci Code you will like this book too.  I have not read Digital Fortress or Angels and Demons but after reading this awesome book I definitely plan to!!

B00125WAWS|5.0|Beautifully and intelligently acted and directed with humor and passion. One of the best films I have seen this year!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I for one am glad to finally get the Dual Shock 3.<br /><br />Did not having it take away from my PS3 experience? No, but it's a must have none the less. As always the DualShock takes gameplay to a whole other level. The added weight is neglegable and I'm sure as newer games (or updates) become available the rumble feature will kick in a little harder.<br /><br />Ever heard \\"You don't know what you had until it's gone!\\"<br /><br />Well I'm a firm believer in \\"You don't know what you've been missing until it arrives!\\".<br /><br />If you don't already have one then pick up this newest entry into the gaming world thats PS3. I got mine and now I'm counting down the hours to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. I remember how integral DualShock was to earlier Metal Gear entries.
B000PKG7I4|4.0|First heard Amy Winehouse soon after Back to Black was released, and before all of the publicized issues. I was blown away by this vocal talent. It is too bad that once again the business, or the fame, or the boy friend has polluted this amazing artist.   Then I heard Frank. Much better vocally than BTB. Pure and uninfected. I just hope for her that she can get through her problems and continue to entertain us for years to come.
0780628551|5.0|I'm rewriting my review of this excellent film today, 3/7/2011.  I agree with the reviewer who thought that, perhaps, the Johnny Depp fans were expecting something completely different and weren't really open to what was presented, and, maybe this was responsible for a lot of the rather negative reviews.  Me?  I like Johnny Depp, but don't think he's been given much for roles.  Maybe, like Clint Eastwood, Johnny Depp might someday have something to say and be able to say it.  In the meantime, it's probably best he just attempt to do what he's told to do to his best ability, even if it is just a lot of crap that some CEO wants for his multi-million dollar bonus.  After all, Bush or 'Bama, CEO's become accountable for what is done and what is not done; when they seem to have the reins.  Multi-multi of billions of dollars stolen and, I know, let's just concentrate on a 7-11 hold-up and put that poor SOB in prison for the rest of his life!  It's so much more manageable.  And, I know, let's just blame billions of dollars in new home computers each year on a few high-school kids; who are so very difficult to locate.  Huh?        Having just seen this film, again, I've uprated it from a four to a five.  That this film is a psychological thriller, I whole-heartedly agree. I think my problem with another reviewer is that what-else-should it be? I liked, \\"2001.\\" I liked Tarkovsky's, \\"Solaris.\\" And, I liked Soderbergh's and Clooney's, \\"Solaris,\\" remake. I liked Andrew Niccol's, \\"Gattaca.\\"  I liked \\"Bladerunner\\" and \\"Close Encounters.\\"  This film was and is very appropriate and illuminating in our time.  As \\"Sci-Fi Horror,\\" it puts the \\"Alien\\" and \\"The Terminator\\" series to shame.  Perhaps, it is the best video sci-fi since \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" and \\"Star Wars.\\"  That this film is not available on both Blu-ray and DVD, instead of neither, is a grave injustice to our children, our world and ourselves.
0345479092|5.0|Absolutely wonderful book!  Every new Mom should read this, gives you so much confidence in taking care of your new baby.  Helps you to understand & read your babies cues, body language, identify cries etc.  Has so much teaching and my baby did everything just as she said he would.  Also helps you to get them to sleep through the night, my baby slept through the night at 8 weeks.  We recommend this book to everyone we know!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Loved Season 1 and couldn't wait to continue watching the show.  Season 2 was just as good if not better as you are pulled into the lives of these 5 adults in NYC.  Great show.

B0018CWEYY|1.0|Let's see how many loose ends we can create and never explain....that's seems to be the driving force behind this show.  I expect the ending will be something like Jack wakes up and the whole thing was a dream.<br /><br />Good grief, this show is ridiculous.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Normally I am not a fan of biopics, but there is something magical about this biopic of children's author Beatrix Potter (Renee Zellweger), than made me fall in love with this film. Potter was an incredible woman and all the more remarkable because she lived in a time when women were not valued. This story of how she persisted in spite of the fact that she should not have succeeded is inspirational. As a piece of cinema, this is a well made film that blends some animation with excellent acting and beautiful scenery. I recommend this film to everyone, but particularly to strong-willed young women.
B00004T9VY|2.0|The music is Cat Stevens. It's as always great.  The RFID tag that is stuck to the album art will ruin it when removed.   Bad Move whomever had the idea of putting RFID tags on album artwork.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|One of the Best movies of it's year.  Every moment, sink or swim, feels infused with love of showmanship, love of highwire creativity and love for the cinema itself. Moulin Rouge is probably not a perfect film, but the cinema is first and foremost a visual medium.    Jody Bissoon
0375831002|5.0|Of the books I've read in the last year, this one is one of my favorites! Not only a good story, it gives some insight to the mentality of Europe in the late 1930s to the end of the war. It is fiction, but very good fiction!
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|Bottom line, Shooter has car chases, gun fights, and some hand to hand fights as well. A fine cast of actors earns this movie a five star rating!
0142001104|5.0|The Art of Possibility is excellent.   I think everyone should read it and seek to implement the suggestions made concerning how to diffuse highly emotional situations.   It is very helpful in getting one to look at one's perspective of situations.  In a nutshell, it would help individuals with conflicting opinions and ideas to resolve their differences.  It would result with a win/win resolution.

B000WC3A0S|4.0|Being a relative newcomer to the Rocky movies, I felt like I needed to get this set so I could own all of the movies on DVD. More or less, I AM pleased with it. I already owned the Collector's Edition of Rocky I but considering that I didn't have the rest of this great Saga, why not?<br /><br />There are no special features (unless trailers count and in my book, they don't) on Rockys 1-5. Rocky Balboa comes with a pretty decent amount of special material to dig into though. All of the films come in slim cases and the set box itself looks pretty nifty on your DVD shelf.<br /><br />Finally, there are the movies themselves and, depending on one's point of view, vary in quality. In this reviewers personal opinion, Rockys 1-3 are fine movies in their own rights while 4-5 are the obvious sour spots and Balboa ends the Saga on a high emotional note.<br /><br />Whether you are a fan of good boxing movies or Sylvester Stallone in general then this set WILL please you if you're not big on special features. But if you wanted one of the best film sagas ever made in a set packed full of special features all over the place...keep waiting for MGM to release a more proper collector's set in the future (hopefully).<br /><br />\\"Yo, Adrian! I did it!\\"

1600241824|5.0|I LOVE David Sedaris & was really looking forward to this next release.  I was disappointed to find that about half of the stories were on other Audiobooks I have bought.  I feel a bit ripped off.  Couldn't he have waited until he had all new material to publish?  Of course the material is all very funny & he's the guy I'd like sitting next to me next time I fly.  Listen to the book & you'll get it!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This movie is designed to complete the Firefly TV Series produced by Joss Whedon (\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", \\"Angel\\").  I highly recommend the series, but also think it really helps to have seen it before viewing this movie.<br /><br />That said, this intense film was more than just a 2-hour episode:  it truly granted the poor doomed Firefly series the big-screen treatment it deserved.  \\"Serenity\\" is full of action, humor, intensity, and character depth.  It's also got its share of surprise twists that will shock you and keep you on the edge of your seat.  At a certain point as Serenity builds to its finish, I became depressed, because I realized that writing this good was about to come to a complete and final end.<br /><br />The collector's edition is reasonably priced and contains many behind-the-scenes goodies as you'd usually expect in a two-disc DVD: bloopers, outtakes, and a few fun tidbits I'll leave for you to enjoy.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and what a pity the Firefly series was too cool to survive Hollywood.

B0017PCX20|5.0|Unraveling the threads of emotional ties, Tightly Unwound weaves together a virtual tapestry of the human experience and then rips it apart at the seams with the precision of a finely tuned snare drum. \\"My Debt to You\\" interlaces the first couple of knots in this aching ode to emotional obligation, while \\"Shoot First\\" painfully anticipates the needle to the heart, as rapid fire thrusts of guitar tear at the spun moral fiber. \\"Sinners\\" is a righteously Indignant and hellishly beautiful pattern of behavior that scoffs at the idea of following  strict patterns of thinking. \\"Tightly Wound\\" comes undone in glorious explosions of sound and colour, creating a painful dream filled with comforting illusions, followed by \\"The Sorry State\\", which is a vivid image of vaguely defined abject despair, wallowing in a mess of flailing synthetic chords neatly wrapped around every last suicidal note. The music of \\"My Bleeding Hand\\" is held taut and in parallel order to the loosely defined lyrics that are nevertheless clear in their intent, and \\"And So Say All of You\\"  clearly states its question of self worth as seen through the eyes of needles looking at an image hung in an exalted position above fragile expectations. \\"Different World\\" and \\"To Much to Lose\\" are both finely woven masterpieces that stretch across the length of time in timeless fashion.  The happy existence found in the loosely knit illusions of \\"Different World\\" is both sad and pathetic. The music is languid and harsh and as hypnotically soothing as a metronome swinging guillotine-like above those dreamy and dewy filled eyes.  The raising and lowering sequence of \\"Too Much to Lose\\" is wound onto the emotional spools in a deliberately slow manner, initially creating a  picture of unselfish love, while internally the threads are torn and frayed. Guitars, Bass, Drums and keys thrash up and down like the bobbins in a sweat factory, and the end result is one of the best creations ever to have sprung from the musical loom ofBruce Soord, the singer, guitarist and  creator of all that is The Pineapple Thief.
B000084HAJ|5.0|I wonder if the good folks who criticized this DVD were listening to the music or just viewing the videotape transfer.  To watch and hear such a flawless artistic performance sung FROM MEMORY by chorus and soloists alike, accompanied by authentic period instruments in the splendid acoustics of St. Mark's Cathedral, the venue for which it was composed, is a rare treat indeed.  This is a performance for the ages, and worthy to be owned by every lover of early music.  One can get no closer to hearing the music as Monteverdi surely intended it than this brilliant performance by John Eliot Gardiner and Monteverdi Choir.  I heartily recommend it without reservation.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|... then buy \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\"<br /><br />If you only buy TWO \\"success\\" books... then buy \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" AND \\"The Success Principles: How to Get From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be.\\"<br /><br />The financial investment you make in this book is far, far less than the investment of time it takes to make full use of it.  There is just so much information that Canfield throws at you, you'll feel like you are trying to drink from a fire hose.  It is truly an encyclopedia of success, except that you never really hope to read an encyclopedia from beginning to end and absorb and apply the information therein.  So it's less of a \\"look it up\\" kind of book and more of a precept-by-precept tool for improving your life.  You almost need to read it twice: Once to \\"learn\\" and then again to \\"do.\\"<br /><br />This book needs to be not only on your shelf, but a part of how you perceive and respond to the world at large.

The underneath message about a pretended form of outer energy understood as the projection of our own interiors demons lacked dramatic intensity due the secondary plot ( you should be notice this issue would be carved in relief in Solaris thirteen years after). But in case you make to take the risk you are still on time to enjoy (although certain outdated special effects) an interesting proposal to watch and discuss.<br /><br />A referential cult movie since its appearance!

1582701709|1.0|Long before this book came out, I've been trying (ever since 1990!) this exactly type of positive thinking and it DOES NOT WORK!    The biggest lie they tell you is that you don't need to plan for your goal, just imagine it and it'll come true. But guess what? If you really don't plan ahead, you WILL FAIL.     If order to achieve your goal, you need the combination of three things, and they're equally important:    1) The IQ and EQ that you're born with.  2) What you have learned (from experience, books, internet, etc.) and applied.   3) Luck/opportunities.     Unfortunately, there're books/people like this \\"Secret\\" that will mislead you and steal your money at the same time. Of course, thinking positively is a healthy thing to do, but to achieve significant goals you need to do a lot more than that!
0977326403|5.0|As a social entrepreneur and current business school student, I was fascinated by Collins' work in Good To Great, and I am thrilled that he has provided this monograph to answer the questions that many of us the social sector have been wrestling with since his Good To Great publication was first released.<br /><br />Unlike most publications about this sector, Collins directly provides interesting insight into accountability measures for social sector organizations, as well as the characteristics and the qualities that successful managers exhibit in the social sector.  As usual, his Good To Great technique of analysis has yielded him not only important take-aways for organizational management, but an intuitive sense of how organizations, both for-profit and non-profit, can truly achieve sustainability.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone who enjoyed Good To Great and has pondered its applications to the social sector.  I would also highly recommend the How-to guide: [[ASIN:0615182844 Business Planning for Enduring Social Impact: A Social-Entrepreneurial Approach to Solving Social Problems]] by Andrew Wolk and Kelley Kreitz for anyone looking for a very clear and direct approach to putting some of Collins' idea and suggestions to practice.

1572816112|5.0|\\"While the physical deck has taken over three years to complete, from an inspirational standpoint, Deviant Moon Tarot has been at least thirty years in the making. It is not only a testament to my art, but a record of my life.\\" - Patrick Valenza, from the LWB (Little White Book)<br /><br />I've seen hundreds of Tarot decks over the years, and I can honestly say there is nothing on the market that rivals the sumptuous textures, masterful artistry and utter originality of the Deviant Moon Tarot.<br /><br />For months now, several images of the Deviant Moon Tarot were posted to the web, capturing the imagination of Tarot enthusiasts worldwide. Many were clamoring for news, more card images and a definitive release date with an almost desperate excitement.<br /><br />Tarot fans, rejoice! U.S. Games has now unleashed the highly anticipated Deviant Moon Tarot upon the world! And let me tell you, if the exquisite, highly-detailed online images whetted your appetite, the actual deck goes above and beyond expectation! (After my deck arrived in the mail, I was almost shaking trying to unwrap the cellophane.)<br /><br />As Patrick revealed in my interview with him a few months ago, he created each image made by manipulating digital photographs taken of 18th century tombstones. He noted:<br /><br />\\"I would explore cemeteries and abandoned buildings, taking many photos of textures or objects of interest to blend into my drawings.  Rotted doors and windows became buildings and structures, while tombstones parts were fabricated into clothes, accessories, or even the citizens themselves.  I like to think the photos contain some of the `spirit' found in the places I have visited, and that perhaps some of their energy will reflect in the cards I have made.\\"<br /><br />As you can tell, the Deviant Moon Tarot blows me away. One of the reasons is Patrick's ornate and captivating rendering of the Aces. In most Tarot decks, the Aces are relegated to a singular suit symbol with minimal artistry; however, in the Deviant Moon Tarot, the Aces are lavishly illustrated.<br /><br />Replete with arresting beings with unusual bodies, moonlike faces combine with anatomy reptilian, humanoid, mechanic and alien. The King of Pentacles wears a crown of smoking black industrial chimneys while the King of Wands shepherds playful children with tree-like heads.<br /><br />In the amusing Five of Cups, a nagging wife reams out her husband for presumably spilling three of the cups while her hen-pecked husband holds his ears against her shrillness. In the Five of Pentacles card, a milky three-fingered and toed creature with pendulous, pointed silver-tipped breasts creeps around a building housing a giant peering eye. (According to the LWB, she is a woman of ill repute).<br /><br />The Deviant Moon expands on Rider-Waite imagery with a gloriously twisted perspective, reflecting common associations in dazzling patterns, striking colors, and surprising juxtapositions (e.g. a tree that bleeds red, a Page that has created himself out of spare parts and a sharp-dressed masked armless woman with a wheel for a left \\"foot\\").  The 9 of Cups, usually deemed the \\"Wish Card\\", aptly depicts a genie who's just emerged from a child's magic lamp.<br /><br />Surprisingly illuminating, the 41-page LWB provides upright and reversed meanings as well as a brief commentary on each card (which is especially helpful for some of the puzzling depictions). Some of the meanings I hadn't heard before, such as the 5 of Wands indicating \\"conflict with neighbors\\", the 8 of Swords can pointing towards censorship and the 5 of Cups revealing marital strife.<br /><br />The slick, glossy cards measure approximately 5 ¼ x 2 ¾ inches with a rather muted moon motif in earth tones comprising the reversible backings. This Premier Edition of the Deviant Moon Tarot also comes with a custom 17 x 20 inch spread sheet with Patrick's comprehensive 10-card Lunatic Spread.<br /><br />I knew I'd love the deck when I got it, but I had reservations if such a bizarre yet stunning offering would \\"read\\" well. I'm pleased to report that not only is the Deviant Moon Tarot a solid reading deck, but also unexpectedly insightful. Even when I first began looking at the cards, phrases would pop into my head describing possible meanings for what I saw.<br /><br />So despite the unusual characters populating the world of the Deviant Moon, they still speak messages relevant and purposeful to discerning individuals. This would make a great journaling deck, too, as well as one for comparative Tarot studies.<br /><br />Art deck aficionados will want to have the Deviant Moon Tarot for their collection as well as those in the market for a decidedly offbeat deck. As reluctant as I am to say it, I don't think this deck will appeal to *everyone* nor would it necessarily be a good first deck for those wanting to devote themselves to studying the Tarot. However, the Deviant Moon Tarot contains amazing gifts for the beholder and the LWB is better than most for explaining card meanings.<br /><br />Patrick Valenza's illustrations are so magnificently dramatic and unique that I hope U.S. Games comes out with a coffee book version of this deck, as well as an array of related giftware and art prints. I know that I'd definitely be in line for all things Deviant Moon!<br /><br />(To see 16 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at [...])<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Presentsed to report that not only is the Deviant Moon Tarot a solid reading deck, but also unexpectedly insightful.

I know that I'd definitely be in line for all things Deviant Moon!

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I love Bruce....but I love Bruce with the E Street Band better. I've always felt that magic was what happened whenever I went to a show. I have always wondered if the band also were in as much disbelief as I was that such intense magic happened one more night...and why to them. This album delivers that magic. It's my favorite in a long time. Danny will be missed.
0446343129|3.0|I loved this book, but have come to the unhappy conclusion that some of the \\"facts\\" are false.<br /><br />Page 109, history of scurvy as being related to sugar intake:  \\"It was as if there had never been any explorers out there ahead of Queen Bess's men.  How about the Vikings, the Phoenicians, and the sailors of the Far East?\\"<br />---Well, the Vikings barely left sight of land.  When they traveled to what is now Canada long before Columbus, they went around the top of the Atlantic, so presumably had access to fresh food.  The Phoenicians were in the Mediterranean - presumably also near land.  And the reference to sailors of the Far East didn't turn up any long voyages in my hunt.<br /><br />Page 112: The British navy \\"continued to flog scorbutical sailors for almost 50 years\\"<br />---I wasn't able to find any reference to flogging sailors to punish them for having scurvy, whether \\"prescribed as an appropriate remedy\\" for malingering or otherwise.  The only similar reference I've found so far was to punish a sailor for not eating his sauerkraut, which was thought to keep them healthy.<br /><br />This book is absolutely fascinating and mostly accurate, but unfortunately I'll probably have a slow time verifying the other parts I'm most interested in.<br /><br />If you know errors here in this review, or other errors in this book, please comment - I'll read it eventually.  Or, contribute to Wiki.<br /><br />Thanks!

0375703764|4.0|Danielewski has created a genre of his own. Reading House of Leaves is like watching a film on paper. His method of writing in frames (as if it were a film reel) is nothing short of genius. His use of footnotes and fake texts had me feeling like I was doing investigative research on something absolutely terrifying. Johnny Truant's interludes and back story are another amazing innovation in writing. The best way that I describe this work to fellow readers is that it's a intertwined three-part narrative.<br /><br />Perspective 1: The Navidsons<br />Perspective 2: Zampano's Research on the Navidsons<br />Perspective 3: Johnny Truant's struggling with Zampano's work and dealing with life in general.<br /><br />Moreover, this is merely scratching the surface of this masterwork. I imagine you could spend years \\"finishing\\" this novel. In fact, you'll find yourself going back to it months after reading the final chapters wondering if you missed anything.<br /><br />The only reason that I didn't give this a five star review was because of the level of pornographic literary imagery in some of the sex scenes. I found some of it distasteful and quite vulgar. I guess it adds to the shock value but I found it mostly unnecessary. Some people love this stuff but I didn't. Just a personal opinion.<br /><br />Bottom-line: If there is any justice in the world, this novel will go down in history as a ground-breaker. It's masterfully crafted and its architect deserves a huge pat on the back.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  Every other song is a hit in my book.
0743270754|4.0|An extraordinary book, well worth the time to read. Sometimes I felt that Goodwin got bogged down in a good deal of unnecessary detail - the book could have been much better without it all, but, all in a all, a truly remarkable effort.
B000255LNE|5.0|This is a great compilation if you love Phil Collins slow songs. It has all his popular slow songs along with some I have never heard before. Phil also does some excellent covers of well-known songs like \\"My Girl\\" and \\"Somewhere\\".

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|You could never realize how great this concert was without actually being there to see it for yourself.  with that said, this dvd was a very close 2nd.  just as i felt in the concert, i felt watching this dvd... you did not want it to end.  this video is from a few years back, so a few hair changes and adjustments to costumes... i have an eye for small detail.  celine is amazing and put on a fantastic show.  i have watched the video several times and have sent it as a gift to my mother, whom i took to one of celine's last shows in dec of 2007.  it is a fantastic memoir.
B000S88JTS|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when I was 4 years old in Las Vegas! One week later my mom got me my first mini bike, and I've been an avid off road motorcycle enthusiast since then. I finally found this movie in a video store in 1981 (10 years after first seeing it), if you like motorcycles, and the 70s, this movie is the best. Bruce Brown does a killer job putting this masterpiece together. Flattracker Mert Lawlwill, Malcolm smith, Steve Mcqueen, and a host of other stars, and future stars appear. I have viewed this movie at least once a year, since I found it in the store in 1981! Also very humorous!
B00068TJM6|5.0|Excellent product.  May cost a little more, but from the quality and the feel of the weight I believe this watch to be an excellent buy.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|The reason why the let people download this one for what they thought they could afford is quite simple: they themselves did not invest that much time or energy in it! Indeed the sound is poor and the finall packaging on the CD really horrible, so I guess you get what you pay for!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|With all the talk about the subject these days, I wanted to see for myself if someone could explain it so that anyone can understand.  Al Gore does just that in this documentary.  Step-by-step, he has combined startling scientific facts with video footage of the relentless melt-down already at play beneath the globe's polar ice caps and its consequences. The detail to which he goes is perfect for anyone to grasp the catastrophe in the making at this very moment, slowly, but surely.  A must see video documentary, especially for the skeptics among us.
0452289963|5.0|I am joining the cast of thousands who found this book life changing- in small ways for me. The most immediate thing I experienced while reading the book was a profound sense of gratitude and knowledge of how beautifully simple and practical it is to live in the now. While I admit to having some feelings of confusion as well while reading it, I continued to read in the \\"present moment\\" and stopped worrying about what I didn't understand immediately. The discussion about ego were so right-on and I found my ego constantly wanting to take the upper hand while I was reading the book- it was kind of funny to observe this in myself. I simply began to do as the author suggested -bringing myself back to the present moment when I felt my usual anxiety about not getting enough done for the day or worrying about what I had to do next. I liked  Ekhart Tolle's references to other great spiritual leaders throughout the book. The book repeats the theme of living in the present moment and offers some simple and helpful ways for moving closer to accomplishing this in our lives.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It didn't stick 100% to the book, but it was equally as great! Gerrad Butler, Hillary Swank, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan were perfectly cast. Lisa Kudrow is hilarious! I highly recommend this movie to all you hopeless romantics!
B00110K62U|5.0|I found my self humming and singing the music all day.  Saw the original stage show in Phoenix, Loved the music on this dvd.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is by far one of the most historically accurate and well done dramas about WWII. Stephen Ambrose is a great writer. The comraderie of the men and the personal struggles they faced was very engaging. You can't wait until the next episode. Damien Lewis's protrayal of Mack Winters is phenomenal. You really like him, sympathize with him, root for him and admire him all at the same time.  I love the commentary by the actual soldiers the drama portrays. The extra material helps you understand military terms and concepts.   This is a refreshing contrast to see our men in uniform protrayed as the heroes and liberators that they are rather than the slanted view shown by the mainstream media.  The only negative: Would caution anyone buying it for class room use that one of the DVD's (last one?) contains a rather graphic nude sex scene. It is the only one of its kind in the entire series. Could have done without it.   (Female reviewer.)
0553385461|5.0|I thought this book was awesome.  I never read the first one, but I couldn't putthis one down.  Pretty understandable and perfect for those of us that should have been physics majors but did something else instead.
0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild is an excellent read, telling the tragic tale of Chris McCandless's ill-fated journey to the heart of the Alaskan wilderness. Krakauer clearly did his due diligence when it came to researching the book, and the inclusion of his own time in Alaska draws interesting parallels between himself and McCandless. Many young men have journeyed to the wilderness in the hopes of find themselves (Thoreau, McCandless, John Muir, Krakauer), and many have narrowly escaped death in such expeditions. Unfortunately for McCandless, he was not afforded the luck to ever walk out with a new sense of purpose in his life. Thankfully for us, Krakauer does a fine job of reconstructing his multi-year journey, and analyzing the circumstances that ultimately led to his death.
0763619612|5.0|I love how this book helps kids make their mark. I use this book in my class rooms and it goes great with my little ones who are just learning how to make art for the first time.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I like this kind of headphones, mostly because the ear buds do not stay in place and stay in. These are over the head-in the ear kind- kind of like ear buds but with an over the head band to hold them in place.
0061537934|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was very touching and endearing how it is narrated.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Great CD by a great artist.  I can't say anything bad about this CD.
B0002CHIJW|3.0|I have mixed feelings after watching this movie. Of course the lowlifes who rape Jennifer should have been tracked down and dispatched. However, it's HOW she does it and WHAT she does that is unnecessarily cruel. Jennifer's heart reveals itself to be as dark as the lowlifes who raped her. I could easily see her being one of their gang (if she were a man). At first I was 100% FOR HER, but later \\"found the needle\\" sliding a bit the other way. That scene where she \\"cuts below the belt\\" and then goes downstairs and turns up the stereo to drown out the screams struck me as weird and cruel. Also, WHY does SHE also use her body to get even? She gets \\"even\\" but she commits murder to do it. Last time I checked, murder was against the law.If the police knew she did these things she would arrested for murder.  WHY does she never call or go the police? On one level I understand her, on another I don't. Sorry, but she ends up coming off as unstable, cruel and again not unlike the lowlifes. Sympathy for the devil?????  well, just maybe.
0553382179|5.0|Recomend 100% I love this book and use it and refer back to it often.  Wonderful
0140544518|5.0|My grandchildren loved this book.  It was so cleverly written.  Illustrations were great.
B0013V33DG|5.0|It is first class, the photography, sound and the performance, Dessay and specially Florez are out of this world.
B0014KD46W|4.0|Nine Lives is an excellent new recording by one of my favorite artists of all time. After listening to it, I had a craving to hear all my old vinyl recordings of 'Traffic', especially \\"The low spark of high heeled boys\\".  Upon repeated listening to Winwood's latest recording, I found myself enjoying it more, but it's not easy to compare it to his classic tunes. Those were different times, music that defined an era. Still, I'd rather listen to Steve Winwood, new or old, than most anybody else.
0696204800|4.0|Although strip quilting is my favorite type of quilting, this book was inspiring enough that I did a quilt for a classroom and had each student picked out a favorite block. The instructions on how to make the block were good.  Although I thought making pieced blocks would be too difficult, it was surprising to me how easy it was to make some really cute blocks.  Pieced patchwork blocks may not be my favorite but I now consider them to be attractive and fun.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I first stumbled upon \\"North and South\\" on Youtube one night and I was instantly captured by the beauty of this film. Before I was done watching it, I ordered the DVD from Amazon and (because of its length) it actually arrived before I had the time to finish watching it online (Amazon's delivery on this was fast thankfully).   If you are a fan of period films or the adaptations of Jane Austen's work, you will LOVE North and South. It has all of the heart of your favorite period film but with a touch more realism; its characters don't spend their lives going from tea with friends to balls in pretty gowns. Instead there is a real story here with the undertones of different classes clashing, the emergence of new wealth with the industrial revolution, and best of all a hero to perhaps (gasp!) rival the beloved Mr. Darcy. Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe do an awesome job as the two main characters and there is a real chemistry between them.   My only complaint is plot wise, I could have done with some more interaction between Margaret and Mr. Thornton besides the wonderful ending. Otherwise its a great movie to watch on a long quiet afternoon or whenever you're trying to procrastinate on that darned never ending homework!
1400032717|4.0|This book was interesting in how the mystery was spun out by living in another persons head for a while.  I would like to have a classroom set of this book because it would be educational as far as being intrigued and appreciative of the different kinds of thinking, The math in the book was fun to see how it was used to calmed the main character Christopher.  It was fun to see how confusing facial expressions could be to Christopher also.<br /><br />It's fun when a book takes you to a different time or place, but this time it took me to a different brain and it was a nice journey.
0066620996|5.0|I would rate this book as a five star book.  It gives the reader different points of view regarding the management of different companies that made the transition from good companies to great companies.  The most important subject of the book revolves around the people.  In the book, Jim Collins describes how great companies made the transition because they had Great people working for them that understood the Hedgehog concept.  Overall, I would really recommend this book to management because it describes how to improve the quality and the performance of your company.    Ismael Favela
1416523359|2.0|Woody Allen had a great true moment of self-criticism in his film \\"Stardust Memories\\" (1980) where he comes upon a couple of aliens who tell him:<br /> \\"We enjoy your films! Particularly the early, funny ones.\\"<br /><br />The same is with Stephen King  who got lost in himself somewhere in the early 1990s.<br /><br />Lisey's Story is neither Christine nor The Shining. It's neither Pet Sematary nor Salem's Lot. Bluntly, it's more like a lot of blah blah blah tucked into 600 pages. Sometimes, you may get the creepy feeling that King let his comupter do most of the job by itself.<br /><br />It won't hurt King to take a long break, relax and search for the roots of good writing. I think he can afford that.
B000OY8NII|5.0|If you are looking for an intelligent mix between sci fiction and mystery, this is the series for you.  Quirky, funny, intelligently written, nice amount of sexual engery (woof-woof Colin Fergeson!), great mix of cast, Season One is a must have!
0385340567|3.0|...but the plot that doesn't work. The author has obviously talked to some vets and come to the proper conclusion regarding this war and the politics that are to blame for the disaster that we will pay for, for generations. This plot is more like a math puzzle. A few straight answers, or even the right questions, would have cut the fat from this tale.
0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind suited my taste for fantasy thoroughly.  It has strong characters , solid plot development and enough original features and creatures to make it interesting.  I am intrigued by the narrator, his scribe and his student and want to know them better.  I want to read the next installment and hope they continue with this strong story line.
0823023494|4.0|As an aspiring cartoonist with my own cast of characters on my Captain Cockle website I found this book an excellent and yet simple guide to creating characters that leap out of the page. The inclusion of guest cartoonists, many of them very famous in their own fields, is a great idea and adds depth to the book. If you have a limited budget and are confused by the huge variety of \\"how to\\" books on cartooning, I would strongly recommend this one as an essential starting point.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|This was a hard movie to watch but I liked it. What that means is I liked the acting, the story, and effects, but I wanted to slap someone silly that thought filming it as a everyone has one portable handheld camera so that makes it \\"REAL\\". I don't like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" for the same reason. If I want to watch home movies I can pull my own out. Come to think of it I have never  seen any home movies where it looked like they purposely played catch, drop, and spin with their camera when filming. Even the worst amateurs can do a better job. So sorry the \\"amateur\\" angle doesn't fly. We don't plop down $9 plus to see it in a theater or $15 plus to get the DVD so we can watch the absolute worst in amateur photography. My wife wouldn't watch after about five minutes as the camera moving all over made her sick to the stomach.<br /><br />I had alot of trouble myself and had to look away regularly even though I wanted to watch. Now as a person that has filmed movies for years, if you want to do this nonsense because \\"YOU\\" think it's edgy or something please get someone that at least can hold the camera right, any mom or dad off the street namely. They have lots more experience than the camera person in this movie, that or the director told them to make this movie this way so people would hurl alot. So once again I loved the movie, just not how it was filmed. Had they held the camera still more I would have given it four and a half stars. Go to any of the web sites sporting amateur videos and you will see they are filmed far superior to this movie. And they unlike this movie are in fact edgy and cutting edge ideas in camera work. You people voting negative to us that thought the camera work sucked, why have DVD sales been so poor? Even people that are curious because of all the commentary are only renting it. - C. Luster
B0011HOEY4|4.0|As I read these reviews, there's a healthy diversity of opinion, which, there generally seems less of on Amazon than there ought to be. I feel the reason is that if you dare to give negative reviews, the fans of the item will dump on negative responses, and, of course, many want the approval ratings. Perhaps, Amazon should adjust their ranking methods.<br /><br />Now the review: I feel this flick is good, not great. *** 1/2.<br />What I liked best was the historical sweep.  Although, I was aware that heroin was coming out of Nam in body-bags, like a blizzard, and that the inner city dope trade was booming, the fim graphically puts the pieces together in such a way, that one must understand that the brutal continuation of these wars has something to do with the hundreds of thousands that are employed by it, as one of the characters points out. I say 'wars' because the largest producer of hard drugs today is Afganistan. I really appreciated that insight, although of course, there are many other killings spawned by that evil racket, war.  As far as the historical accuracy - I hear that Frank Lucas said only about 20% was true.  Otherwise, I felt that the screenwriters were up against the wall with too much material and too many characters to develop in this venue - it would have made a much better mini-series, at least six hours of material here - even a full season.  For this reason, the script was compromised, choppy, compressed, and full of cliches - whether it was done before in Serpico, Shaft, or elsewhere, the film hardly displayed the kind of character development we see in the Godfather, Once Upon A Time in America, Casino, or the smooth interplay between story, character, and hard-hitting violence we see in L.A. Confidential (that forgotten, underrated Crowe performance).  On that note, there's no substitute for good, old-fashioned violence in a gangster film. In this one - I felt like I'd been to a very fine restaurant with skimpy portions. Let's see some skull and brains splattered on the sidewalk in AG2, yuh?ins splattered on the sidewalk in AG2, yuh?
0790740443|3.0|Kurt Russell is good as a future solder in a special unit. When the new improved versions are introduced his years of experience almost kills one of them but him and two others are killed and left on a dump planet. The only problem is Kurt wasn't quite dead yet. Some survivors of a ship crash that has lived there for years nurse him back to health. Although he was raised to have no feelings and be the best soldier he could be he develops a liking for these civilians. So much so when the improved versions do an Op on the planet and anyone there is considered hostiles, he defends the civilians. Good action movie if you enjoy movies like \\"No Escape\\" and \\"Universal Soldier\\". Good quality DVD and fair replayability. - C. Luster
B000063DFN|5.0|One of Iron Maiden's best. If you've never heard \\"Flash of the Blade\\" or \\"Losfer Words\\" you need to buy this disc.
B000P12LWY|1.0|I ordered this DVD set because I am a huge fan of the show, but I don't subscribe to Showtime. Everything was great until I got to the final disc. This disc advertises that it contains the 10th episode as well as trailers for other Showtime productions. I never could get to the 10th episode. I tried viewing all the other offerings including registering for give aways and still could not open the 10th episode. To me, this disc set turned out to be nothing more than ads for Showtime. I returned the disc set for a full refund, which by the way, I STILL have not received from Amazon even after numerous reassurances that they have given me (it still hasn't shown up where they said they put it). If you want to watch The Tudors, my advice will be to sign up for Showtime, otherwise they're gonna rip you off!!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|This is a milestone in Star Trek History. We are finally able to see the original series as Gene Rodenberry would have done it if the technology (and the money) were available to him. The beauty shots of the Enterprise are so spectacular that you'll replay them again and again. The shots of other ships, along with their manuevers and weapons fire, are breathtaking. The planets look like real planets, and the rocks don't look like styrofoam anymore.  If you are a Trek fan, this is a MUST HAVE!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I've been waiting for this movie.  Missed my SG1.  Movie good - ties up Ori story.  Can't wait for the next movie to be out.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|It started with a bang and ended with a thud. The majority of the scenery and the action scenes are jaw dropping. However the movie goes from bad to worse after 30 minutes. It's because of the plot and the directing I think.
B00005JM02|4.0|The product description was accurate.  Shipping took a little longer than  most products I have ordered from Amazon.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|The film is boring. There's not exciment and no suspense. The plot is like that of a video game. I mean there's nothing original. The worst thing is the special effects. In many scenes, I can see clearly that the settings are fake.
1891252089|5.0|I love this book! it has all the positions you can think of, and different ways of doing each one to make them easier or more advanced. I loved how it showed the guy in the book doing yoga poses on cliffs and stuff. It was inspirational (although i won't be doing that anytime soon!) It came in great condition, and quickly.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|When I watched it in the theatre, it's in black and white but it's enjoyable movie. The plot is interesting. There are some suspenseful moments. The acting is engaging.    It's absolutely worth watching.

0316143472|3.0|Writer/humorist David Sedaris' sixth book delivers the hilarity and razor-sharp wit, social commentary, and tenderness of his previous books, but fans of Me Talk Pretty One Day, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, and Naked may be in for a bit of a disappointment. His previous smashing success has made it increasingly hard for him to top himself. Upon diving into Sedaris' latest collection of autographical essays, one can't help but feel De' Ja' Vu. Any fans will have already seen all of these essays featured in the New Yorker magazine already over the past three or four years. I was a bit disappointed to get the \\"Wait a minute, I've read this before!\\" feeling with the opening story, \\"It's Catching,\\" about his mother-in-law's medical bout with a worm living under her skin. But I guess we can't really blame Mr. Sedaris for the fact that we love him so much that we've already read pretty much all of these in The New Yorker, Esquire, etc. magazines.<br /><br />Fans of Augusten Burroughs will enjoy Sedaris and also recognize him as a much more believable writer of the memoir. Unlike previous collections which each focus on one part of his life, \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames,\\" covers the range of Sedaris' anecdotal life: from childhood and life at home with his mom and sisters, to his adult life, including when he first moved to Paris and dropped out of French classes and ran around telling everyone \\"D'accord\\" because of his limited vocabulary. Because this book covers such a wide Sedaris life range, it feels almost like a \\"best of\\" kind of collection.<br /><br />The book manages to only give you a good quiet laugh, not the rollicking hilarity of his previous works (check out \\"Santaland Diaries\\" from 'Holidays on Ice,' where Sedaris chronicles his days working as a Macy's elf, and \\"Repeat after Me\\" from 'Dress Your Family...' and 'David Sedaris: Live at Carnegie Hall). But remember this is David Sedaris here, so a quiet laugh still far exceeds any other American humorist writing today. Some of the highlights in this collection include: \\"Keeping Up,\\" a day around the zoo with Sedaris and his partner Hugh, and in the mind of Sedaris' during a lover's quarrel; \\"Buddy, Can You Spare a Tie?\\"--Sedaris chronicles his trial use of an external catheter (Window seat in a cross-country non-stop flight? Don't mind if I do!); \\"Memento Mori,\\" one of the funniest stories here, chronicling Sedaris' purchase of an actual human skeleton, and the ensuing spookhouse terror of keeping it in his home; and the memorable \\"What I Learned,\\" Sedaris' speech to graduates of Princeton, his alma mater.<br /><br />Fans will want this book to add to their Sedaris collection, but it could also be a good, safe introduction to Sedaris newbies, as the 10-15 page essays here aren't as bizarre as previous works ('Naked' being the weirdest). Where the book is worth a read (or a purchase) is in the 60-some page \\"The Smoking Section\\" memoir. Here Sedaris chronicles his life as a smoker, from childhood when he first began to smoke (including how in school they went on field trips to the cigarette factory and were given cigarettes to \\"take home to your parents\\"), to his efforts to quit by moving to Hiroshima. (The title of the book is derived from an actual public smoking warning during his stay in Japan.)<br /><br />This is so-so Sedaris, which is still a heckuva lot funnier than anyone else out there. For more laughs, check out his other books, PLUS don't be surprised if you get addicted to his audiobooks, which he and his sister Amy Sedaris read. The audiobooks themselves are gold as his readings make the essays even more hilarious.g today.

B000K7VHQE|1.0|Have no idea who this file was made for, too much dirty language for kids,  and absolutely no story line, or even good acting for Adults. Each character appeared to be playing in his or her own private film. Never came together at all.

B000LC4CVA|4.0|This DVD is absolutely wonderful!!! It is truly worth buying! The voices are like \\"Angels on Earth\\"! These women have such harmony and such class. I would reccommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys Celtic music.<br />It is a \\"MUST HAVE\\" DVD!
0143038583|5.0|Two Thins changed my life.  The first was the movie \\"Who Killed the Electric Car\\" and the second was this book \\" \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\".  I spent 2008 converting my 1999 Ford Ranger Pickup Truck to a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) as aresult of these two media.  The first is obvious the second deserves an explanation.  This book made me realize for the first time that there is a connection between the food supply and petroleum.<br /><br />I thought ok we run out of oil, so we walk or ride a bike or drive electric cars.  It turns out, we also starve to death.  We all need to connect the dots.  Our oil economy is killing us.  We need oil to drive the food supply.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|SUNSHINE doesn't work as science fiction, or as a psychological thriller, or as an action-adventure, or as a slasher movie, or as an homage to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, or as a mystical apocalypse -- but it tries to be all of these things.    The plot is laughably implausible, and the \\"science\\" is simply ridiculous. Lowest point of the film: Several crew members discover that they must cross between two airlocks in total vacuum. (Sound familiar?) There is only one space suit. So what do the other crew members do? They wrap themselves in ... duct tape!    The one star is for the special effects, which are often very good, and for the cast members, who are all beautiful to look at and do their best to make the clunky, humorless script work.    Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when we need it?
B0013J30XG|5.0|I'd never even heard of the Speed Racer cartoon, and if I had I doubt I would have spent much time on it.  I am a sci-fi/fantasy fan, I read way more often than I watch movies, and I strongly protest going to almost any movie more than once.      I went to see Speed Racer three times.  The third time in IMAX, a considerable distance away, just because I loved it so much.  I can't wait for the DVD, so I can watch it whenever I want; I plan to watch it a lot.      Maybe I'm biased, though.  This was a movie with characters that grabbed my imagination and wouldn't let go, and by the time I'd finished frantically writing a thirty-page follow-up to the movie it became hard to tell how much was the movie itself and how much was in my head.  (Pen name DawningStar, title \\"Protecting the Racers\\", Google it if the movie left you wanting a sequel as much as it did me.)    It does take a little suspension of disbelief, but Speed Racer's world is clearly not our world, and to me it makes perfect sense.  The plot was a lot of fun, and there's an emotional depth to the characters I never expected.  They really resonated with me and pulled me right in.      I don't pay much attention to action scenes, so there's more to be said for the movie than just the pretty races.  Though the effects are stunning, to me it's all about the family dynamics.  You should give it a chance.
B000083C49|3.0|I've been re-watching the classic Star Trek trilogy that includes The Wrath of Khan, The Search for Spock, and The Voyage Home. This period was, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the Star Trek franchise and of the three I probably had the fondest memories of The Voyage Home argued by many fans to be the best of all the films. Well, after seeing it again I have confess that it has not aged well. Not at all.<br /><br />To start with the plot is absurd and I have to give major credit to Leonard Nimoy for turning the script into even a half way decent movie. On the other hand Nimoy is the likely culprit for the painfully saccharine sweet feel of the movie. The Voyage Home is without a doubt the most in your face preachy movie in the series. In some ways it reminds me of the tragic Superman IV where Christopher Reeves blackmailed the producers into allowing him to make a message movie. It seems as if actors as directors sometimes forget that the primary reason for movies is entertainment. In the end it's the ham-handedness of the delivery that spoils the message. After The Voyage Home Nimoy went on to direct the mega-hit Three Men and a Baby and then his directorial career just seemed to fizzle out. It's hard to imagine how the director of the biggest grossing movie of 1987 could fall so quickly but maybe there's a limit to just how much heartwarming an audience can take before it turns into heartburn.<br /><br />The biggest strength of the film is also its biggest weakness. Moving the crew of the Enterprise to the 1980's gave the film tremendous opportunities for humor and The Voyage Home is undoubtedly the funniest of the Star Trek films. On the other hand the film is extremely dated and suffers mightily because of it. After the humorousness of seeing the Enterprise crew wander 1986 San Francisco in full Starfleet uniform wears off it feels a tad goofy.<br /><br />The last issue that really hurt the film for me is the glaring plot holes. Having the Klingon vessel be capable of time travel at will seems like something that would throw off the entire dynamics of the series. Yes, I realize that the Star Trek crew has traveled back in time in the television series but in movies I think you need to be a bit more diligent. They made mention of trying to avoid influencing the future but proceeded to do things that would undoubtedly have profound effects. At one point Scotty gives away the formula for \\"transparent aluminum\\" prompting McCoy to point out that they are probably altering the future. Scotty quips, \\"How do we know he [the man he gave the formula to] wasn't the inventor\\" It's a funny line but absurd and hurts the film. In another scene Spock shows concern that Kirk is pawning the glasses McCoy gave him for his birthday. Kirk implies that somehow since they are in the past he will get the glasses as a birthday gift again. It doesn't make any sense. These kinds of things have the feel of lazy scripting used to set up jokes.<br /><br />Perhaps the most obvious example of how overly cutesy the movie is is the song that plays out the final scene. It sounds like something from a Christmas movie not a Star Trek movie. The films running time is less than two hours but man did it feel longer. It was most disappointing that something I loved from my youth turned out to be not nearly as good as I remembered. What keeps the film decent is the wonderful interactions of the main characters but for me it wasn't nearly enough to offset the films defects.le of time travel at will seems like something that would throw off the entire dynamics of the series.

B000FZESY4|5.0|This was the 1st album I got from Opeth, I got it for free. And I was like F*** it. It's free why not give it a listen and check out the DVD. I must say I was blown away after I listen to this album. I almost feel retarded not getting into them sooner.    This album is amazing. I would seriously recommend it to anyone who likes Metal. The songs are well put together and I just love Mikeals voice when he growls as well as sings. Not many people can do both as well as he can I think. I would say which songs are my fav but really...I like them all...but  if i had to pick a few that i listen to the most I would say..Ghost of Perdition, The Baying of The Hounds, Atonement and The Grand Conjuration.
0385340567|1.0|Unfortunately Mr. Child has decided to inject his politics into what used to be my favorite book series and my favorite character. After 300 pages of atypical meandering, boring, storyline from Mr. Child we are then subjected to 100 pages of anti-american, anti-Bush, anti-military, anti-christian bias from the author. Reacher used to be my most awaited book, I doubt that I will ever buy another of Mr. Child's books. What a shame and shame on the author.  Of Course now that Child/Reacher is out of the leftwing closet think of all the new plotlines that can be used: Reacher the Eco-Warrior kicking butt on all americans that don't worship at the altar of \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\", or Reacher defender of oppressed \\"undocumented americans\\" the possibilities are endless!!!    Honestly this series used to be one of the few places that I could escape the intrusion of political correctness and indoctrination and just be entertained by a main character that epitomized good vs evil and believed in doing the right thing.... oh well so much for that....
B000ALZHUC|5.0|Thrash masters Sodom began their career with these two releases, and you can really hear the beginnings of the the death and black metal scenes in both of them. Much like the first two Kreator albums, these releases are very close to death or even black metal, with evil imagery, lyrics and music not found in typical thrash bands from the 80's. All fans of dark extreme metal (be it black, death, or whatever) should check out this EP/LP combo release to hear the roots of the heaviest forms of music in existence.

6304698526|5.0|[[ASIN:1424172705 Fete of Death]]<br />\\"Bullitt,\\" one of the best crime thrillers ever filmed, also has one of the best--if not the best--car chase scenes ever shot.  Cineastes refer to it simply as \\"The Chase.\\"  No other words required.  Who can forget the timeless breathtaking duel between the killers' black-on-black Dodge Charger and Lt. Frank Bullitt's 1968 Mustang GT 390 as they roar up and down the steep hills of San Francisco?  McQueen's Dark Highland Green Mustang literally flies over the hills and, let's face it, puts the Charger to shame.<br /><br />Not only that, \\"Bullitt\\" is a taut cop thriller well directed by Peter Yates with a fascinating police procedural script and a pulsing, jazzy score by Lalo Schifrin.  The honest loner Frank Bullitt goes up against the city machine represented by the amoral publicity-seeking San Francisco DA who cares more about his career than doling out justice to the criminals.<br /><br />And don't forget the King of Cool himself Steve McQueen.  I would go out on a limb and say \\"Bullitt\\" is his best movie.  Certainly, it has his best role.  Too, Robert Vaughn's performance as a smarmy and slick district attorney is dead on.<br /><br />Like McQueen's stripped-down, hopped-up Mustang GT 390, the lean, mean \\"Bullitt\\" hits on all eight cylinders as it explores the seamy, gritty streets of San Francisco.

B0011FXLCC|3.0|I was really shocked when I first listened to this album. It was like wanting to see a hardcore porn and getting stuck with softcore instead. The album is good, because Goldfrapp is an excellent musician but it is better suited to be background music rather than the best track on your dance party mix like \\"Strict Machine,\\" or \\"Slide In\\" were. I could swear that in some parts I thought I was listening to Enya, my worst nightmare.

B0017PCX20|4.0|I have not heard much from this band so I can't compare this to their other works. Some call them progressive, but I would classify them as a good alternative rock band, that reminds me of a merger of Radiohead, Muse, and Syd Barrett.  For the most part this disc is mellow, most of the songs have the same tempo and all have a gloomy sound to them, but there is a splash of crunch on a few tunes. At first this didn't floor me, probably because I wasn't listening close enough. But if you're patient this is a really good disc and maybe not that mellow either. What do I know? Check it out.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Well I bought this movie based purely on the fact that Robert Downey Jr is in it, because I have thanks to Iron Man become a little obsessed with him and I'm just crazy that way, but it turned out to be really good. It was funny and the whole story within a story thing worked out really well. Even the commentary, which I don't usually watch was really funny. So I highly reccommend this movie. ^_^
B000VBP38C|4.0|Bought this for the girlfriend, as she has had to sit through Batman Begins, No Country for Old Men, 300 etc!!! Since I got on the HD-DVD and Blu-Ray kick, lots of Action and Movies with GUY STUFF that she was willing to sit through, so I had to pick up one of her favorites on HD-DVD, I figured if it's in HD, then even if it's not my type of movie, I'd enjoy the Picture Quality/Sound.    Well, very suprised. I thought it was a great movie. Keira Knightley, besides being beautiful, really was wonderful in this movie, the entire cast was great!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a really well-rounded workout. And if you follow the instructions to a tee (i.e. don't wuss out and take breaks), you'll get a good workout. However, as someone who likes a lot of cardio, I would suggest doing a little bit walking beforehand.     I do feel like I save time by working 2 muscle groups at the same time. I have been exercising for years and am still stuck at level one. Man, those side lunges and front raises kill me!
0792843584|4.0|This 1980 movie is famous for the over budget spending by Director Michael Cimino. United Artists went under as a result. Cimino was such a perfectionist and shot so many millions of feet of film that he was unable to cut down and the first edited version was over 5 hours long. The story depicts the Johnson County War near Casper and Kaycee, Wyoming in the late 1800s. The mostly immigrant settlers were supplementing their meager rations with free ranging stolen beef and the Wyoming Stock Growers Association decided to eliminate the problem by eliminating the settlers. I saw the movie years ago and wanted to review it mainly for the scenery, which is spectacular, the music, done by a young violinist, David Mansfield and the horse and livestock scenes. I know the person who furnished the mexican steers used. They hired a whole semi-load of steers, paid daily rent for nearly 3 months and ended up with about 45 seconds of film of the cattle. Some of the horse scenes show the horses falling in a non humane method where they are tripped instead of the usual way using horses trained to fall. Also the whole cast had to learn to roller skate for one notable scene when Mansfield played the violin while skating in \\"Heaven's Gate\\" the name of the settlers Community Hall. Also one of the actors, Allen Keller, was a well known rodeo cowboy. He appears in a few scenes as a 'heavy\\".
B0012E6R3W|4.0|To be quite honest, I haven't bought a Testament CD since Practice What You Preach. I've always admired them as a band, and I was pretty amazed at how good they still sound on this CD. Just straight ahead heavy metal. No surprises, no extreme diversity, no experimentation. Now I'll have to go back and get all their previous stuff (or hopefully there's a greatest hits CD).

B00005JPNZ|3.0|There's a moment in \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls\\" where I had what I would call \\"pulp bumps\\".  In other words, that tingling sensation you feel when you're in the midst of a really good boyhood adventure (the type you want to read by flash light under the covers after bedtime).  It's at the beginning. Soviet soldiers have infiltrated a top secret military compound and their captive is non other than our old friend, Dr. Henry Jones Jr.. After 19 years our hero is grizzlier and gravel-voiced, but still packs a solid punch.  Our villain is a dangerous dominatrix played deliciously by Cate Blanchett who tells Jones he is needed to find the whereabouts of a crate with mysterious magnetic powers; something out a 1950's sci-fi serial.  The commies cock their weapons, John Williams' majestic music swells up, and for one brief and shaken movement I felt I was back in time to the year 1981; I felt I was back in an INDIANA JONES movie.    Well, moments are fleeting.    By the time Shia LeBuf is introduced as \\"Mutt Williams,\\" a pugnacious motorcycle riding greaser who is in actuality...(c'mon, you know), \\"Crystal Skull\\" becomes the Indiana Jones movie I feared would huff and puff its way back into our popular culture. Grand, funny, and exciting in spots- tired and in need of a nap in others.  Okay, perhaps I'm shooting for the obvious with the 60-something triumvirate of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford all trying for one last hurrah. And face it- there is no way that these movie giants can equal the magic of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" but at the very least the filmmakers could give us a damned good story and, unfortunately, \\"Crystal Skulls\\" is a dull one.    All the great movie serials and adventure yarns had what Alfred Hitchcock called, \\"Maguffins,\\" i.e. things that would spark the story but in the end would be unimportant for audiences to enjoy the fun.  In \\"Raiders,\\" the hook was immediate- the Nazis are after the Lost Ark of the Covenant, Jones must find it first.  Bang!  We're off and running!  Here we are never quite sure what a \\"Crystal Skull\\" is and why we should care about anybody obtaining it (in the hands of Ford it actually looks like some weird ice sculpture lifted off someone's buffet table).  Indy and Mutt are locked in the position of having to explain the what, where, and why of this thing over and over again as they dig through the \\"been-there/done-that\\" cob webs and corpses.      ...and the CGI effects are again a bust.  The craftsmanship is gone.  We all remembered that giant ball in \\"Raiders\\" partly because is WAS a giant ball.  \\"Crystal Skulls'\\" computer tricks, despite their state of the art innovation,  lack a palpable depth.  It looks fake and oddly surreal. When Indy and company are besieged by a swarm of killer insects I looked on indifferently- I wasn't seeing real creepy insects but something made possible by a massive hard drive.    Few bright spots are the return of Indiana Jones' long lost soul mate Marion (the ageless Karen Allen). Ford's glee is priceless when he first spots her but David Keop's screenplay waits far too long to bring her into the mix.  Another is a bone fide fabulous action set piece involving what Indiana Jones does best- jumping to and from speeding vehicles and other assorted hair-raising near misses.  Even the classy Blancett gets down and dirty.  Who knew?    Harrison Ford is solid back in Lucas/Spielberg territory.  After having to take ridiculous pot shots by internet fan boys about his age, Ford is very appealing in the same way we can appreciate the craggy beauty of a Clint Eastwood or a John Wayne.  I also found poignant the way his meek professorial alter ego looked more and more like the beloved old school master from \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips.\\"     It's glad to have you back, Mr. Jones.  We've missed you. But if you do return (as the ending implies), please bring with you an interesting story next time.  And perhaps, maybe a giant ball or two.
B000EWBKKI|3.0|Visuals are decent. Not exactly reference material. I do consider it the best action flick of all time so I think it deserves a better transfer. Maybe VC-1 or AVC instead of MPEG2. The fact that it's an older film has something to do with it also I'm sure. Still good for the price.

B00154GEFU|1.0|Too bad you can only go as low as one star.  Although Wetton's voice still sounds great, the songwriting is completely uninspired, and the music at times sounds like cheesy Asian Pop (as in China and Japan, not Asia the band).  A major disappointment for a reunion effort and reminds me of the 80's supergroup 3 (which contained Carl Palmer and Keith Emerson) release that was pure crap.  A good gauge of any piece of music is whether it garners repeat listens, and not only did it not qualify for a repeat listen, but I couldn't even get through some of the songs all the way before I went to the next song.  It really is that bad.  Perhaps these guys should bow out gracefully and just hang it up and retire instead of putting out tripe such as this.
B000002J1L|5.0|1971's 'Nursery Cryme' brought an end to Genesis' early years on the Decca and ABC (now MCA, or Geffen) labels and the beginning to their long partnership with Atlantic Records. Guitarist Anthony Phillips and drummer John Mayhew both left Genesis to experiment; replacing them would be Steve Hackett on guitar and Phil Collins on the drums.    The result of the moving around and lineup changes was better music. The group was no longer a '60s Bee-Gees esque group but now a progressive band, similar to peers like King Crimson and Yes.    Here is the review: track by track.     1. The Musical Box (10:29)-What a way to kick off a record. Peter's voice is incredible here, maybe better than on any other Genesis song that features him on vocals. Steve's guitar is incredible, and Phil's drumming and backing vocals are great. Listen for Tony's 12-string guitar at the beginning.    2. For Absent Friends (1:50)-The first song to feature Phil on lead vocals. The song is very traditional; Phil sings, while Steve plays a very quiet guitar in the background. A must listen.    3. The Return of the Giant Hogweed (8:13)-One of Banks' best keyboard solos comes on this song. And Steve's guitar? Awesome! The lyrics are about a weird type of plant, but Pete's vocals are as good as always. A real highlight--great musicianship all around.    4. Seven Stones (5:10)-The lyrics, the words, the awesome organ intro will leave you in awe. Definitely a highlight here. Any Genesis fan should check this out. A classic.    5. Harold The Barrel (2:59)-One of the stranger songs Genesis recorded. Think of it like this: It's a 3-minute opera. It tells the tale of Harold, who is a disturbed boy who refuses to get help. He is referred to in the song as Harry. I think it may have paved the way for their concept album, 1974's 'The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.'    6. Harlequin (2:56)-A very classical-type of song with peaceful vocals from Mike, Phil and Peter. It's very quiet and calm. Another underrated gem from the Genesis catalog. A must listen for sure.    7. The Fountain Of Salmacis (7:57)-And what a way to close a record! Genesis just rocks on this song. The keyboards are great; Mike's bass is absolutely awesome, and Peter's vocals shine like the light of day. This would become a concert standard for Genesis in the 1970s. It's right up there with one of my favorite Genesis songs. A must listen.    Overall, check out 'Nursery Cryme.' You'll be glad you did. It's awesome in so many ways. It's a jam session, with ditties and short operas in between.    Highly recommended for any Genesis fan. A must-own.    ENJOY!!!

B000GDH9J6|5.0|Over the past decade, many simply marvellous, award-winning films have come out of China, to include \\"Postmen in the Mountains,\\" \\"The Road Home,\\" and many, many others - and this one!<br /><br />If you are anticipating coming out of this one with a morally uplifting spirit, do not.  This a a story based on actual events in Tibet, and the events, especially the climax, will \\"get to you.\\"  One thing you will experience is the utter desolation of Tibet, and in truth, it is something to behold.  My wife and I visited Tibet in 2007, and I was the first westerner to travel on the new two-day train from Chengdu to Lhasa, an experience I would not trade for much of anything.<br /><br />This film will leave you with mixed emotions, but among them will be some positive feelings about the true nature of the Chinese and Tibetan people, and the struggles they endure to live and work in a very inhospitable environment, as well as some of their environmental sensitivities.<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to truly \\"experience\\" a film.  A great story, and some truly fine cinematic work!
0743290119|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book SO much...I identified with different elements of each girl, and had quite a few laugh out loud moments.  The only problem for me was the ending, which didn't really give enough insight into what happened when they finally ironed out some of their relationship issues.  I hope that means there is a sequel coming??      Overall, it was a very enjoyable light read :)
B000XA5K48|4.0|I picked this DVD up because I have other movies starring Clive Owen and Monica Bellucci, they are both great actors. This movie blew me away with its non-stop action and lots of people getting killed in creative ways (i loved the carrot scene at the end) but it was a bit too bloody and sadistic to be a \\"funny\\" movie. Definitely not a movie for kids or anyone who does not like blood.

0618918248|3.0|The Gerswhins got right to the point when they wrote \\"The things that you're liable to read in the Bible, they ain't necessarily so.\\" Likewise did Augusten Burroughs when, in one of his books, he wrote something along the line of \\"Jesus is just Santa Claus for adults\\". With those pithy examples in mind, Richard Dawkins' THE GOD DELUSION would pack more of a knockout punch if the author had trimmed down his exhaustive prose and gone instead for a blunter, more direct style. There are hard nuggets of truth buried among the pages and pages of scientific and psychological examinations for why people believe what they do and how those beliefs continue to spread - perhaps like viruses - even in the face of conflicting evidence. (For example, Dawkins relates that our universe - perhaps one of many but we just don't know yet - contains about 100 BILLION galaxies; with so much real estate to manage, it does seem a trifle unlikely that God - or any Supreme Being - would have time to pop into your head and tell you to pick the job at Starbucks over Target, for example, or answer any prayers from the hundreds of millions of folks who pray on a daily basis.) Readers just have to dig for the kernels and keep slogging long and hard through Dawkins' \\"viewed from every facet\\" approach to demolishing religious irrationality. Still, the book does make the point that man created God (and gods plural, especially the ones no longer worshipped liked Osiris, Zeus, Thor, Apollo, Athena, Isis, etc. - let's just take it one further to the big \\"G\\" himself and get it over with...) and not the other way around, and that if we're to worship anyone, it's Charles Darwin for formulating the ideas of evolution and natural selection. Sam Harris' THE END OF FAITH goes more for the jugular and so packs a much stronger wallop than THE GOD DELUSION - especially in Harris' damning howler of a chapter on Islam - but Dawkins' gentler approach eventually causes for greater reflection on the persistence  and terrifyingly real dangers of religion in our modern world.
1591841984|5.0|This book is truly excellent. Well-written, well-researched and very readable. You will learn everything you even wanted to know about recent history of Apple from this book.    However, book does not go into first release of the Mac back in 1984 and does not talk about people on whose shoulders Steve Jobs is standing today: primarily late Jef Raskin and Andy Herzfeld. Back in the 80s, Steve was only half of a visionary he is today. In this book, Steve states that he wants to make a dent in the universe. Well, he could have made a dent in the universe (a big one) back in the 80s, had he not almost destroyed Mac project and had he not driven away some of the key Mac people from Apple (Jef Raskin in particular). Please read the interview with Jef Raskin in \\"Programmers at Work\\" (also published in the 80s). You may find a used copy on amazon or just look up Susan Lammers' blog (also titled \\"Programmers at Work\\") where she is posting the interviews from now out of print book on a regular basis. Once you read the perspective from the 80s and \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\" you will realize how much Steve himself changed and learned over the years - for the better.     You also may want to check out \\"Apple Confidential\\" for more details on Apple.    It is a pity however that Jef Raskin was not involved in Apple after 1997 and that he and Steve apparently did not get along. A dent in the universe back in the 80s could have spared us all from the Windows.    For disclosure, I am using both PC and a Mac on a regular basis and enjoying Apple's (r)evolutionary path, including all the Lemmings who line up with blankets in front of Apple's stores, \\"thinking different\\" in unison.

B000Y35A94|4.0|Undoubtingly, last year was the absolute return of classic rock acts going back on the road for the first time in eons. Last year was thr return of great rock acts like The Police, Foreigner, and many others. While there have been so many acts that have reunited for the year 2007, Genesis has been one of the biggest surpises of them all. With the big reunion of Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks, the threesome had delivered some of the best live performances that pushed the boundaries of what great Rock music has always been about. That also showed with the re-release of the Genesis catalog on all of the Collins' era albums from A Trick Of The Tail, to We Can't Dance, all the way to their final album Calling All Stations. Now, with a new beginning comes a new live concert.<br /><br />When In Rome 2007, is the first Genesis live concert ever recorded in over a decade with Phil Collins as the lead. The concert was part of the Eurpoean leg of the 2007 reunion tour. The concert featured a great cavalcade of songs that still stand the test of time including the deep and haunting Mama, Invisible Touch, Turn It On Again, Land Of Confusion, as well as some of the more obscure lesser-known songs like I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe) from the Peter gabriel era as well as the surprising Domino. The effects on screen that flash as the threesome perform also sparkle from top to bottom.  The DVD set also includes the behind-the-scenes documentary Come Rain Or Come Shine which showcased a great reflection of the reuniting of Phil, Mike & Tony performing and rediscovering the magic of the great music that has stood the test of time. The extras really blend in well to the magic that Genesis has shined all over the years. The show also shows what had made the concept setup and artwork from the groups' Turn It On Again reunion tour.<br /><br />All in all, When In Rome 2007 is a great DVD set for any die hard Genesis fan, and sparks the return of the magic of the legendary group that has withstood the test of time. If you've never seen Genesis perform live before, than you really don't know what you're missing. It is just too bad the DVD has only been sold throughout Wal-Mart stores, which is sad though. But, it is a great concert that is all worth the while. So turn on Genesis again, because When In Rome, do like the Romans and British do, Rock Out Loud!!!<br /><br />DVD Concert: B+<br /><br />Extras: B<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-as withstood the test of time.

B000002MG1|5.0|Can it be 16 years since this brooding, sinister, insightful CD, opening memorably as it did with the softly sung lyrics to `Drive'?:<br /><br />Smashed!<br />Cracked!<br />Bushwacked!<br />Tie another one to the rack.<br />Baby ....<br /><br />Hey!<br />Kids!<br />Rock and roll!<br />Nobody tells you where to go!<br /><br />What if I ride?<br />What if you walk?<br />What if you rock around the clock?<br />Tick ... Tock ... Tick ... Tock ...<br /><br />The dark nature of the album finds deeper expression in the enigmatic (an adjective that seemingly always pops up when REM is in play) `Try Not to Breathe'. The haunting tune is graced with lyrics that make its title not an exhortation to someone else but rather a determined effort on behalf of the speaker himself:<br /><br />I will try not to breathe.<br />This decision is mine. I have lived a full life<br />And these are the eyes that I want you to remember.<br /><br />The song sets up to wonder about a theme that is primus inter pares in this album, that of death, its imminence, and the ability to choose its moment.<br /><br />If `enigmatic' is the right word, `The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight' calls for it in all caps. Is the joke on the listener who looks for its inner logic, because there is none? Maybe. Good bands--and REM is a definitive good band--can get away with that kind of thing once or twice every second album or so. Lesser artists just look like posers. So one takes this track with a grand of sand because what follows is indisputably, memorably golden.<br /><br />The precious ore in this album is concentrated in the mega-hit pondering called `Everybody hurts'. It would be difficult to exaggerate the enthralling comfort of this piece. Recalling at the outset Chicago's unforgettable `Colour My World', the song's simple lyrics channel powerful consolation to the listener who hurts. Really hurts. In the hearing, he discovers a comfort that is more like shared grief than denied pain:<br /><br />When the day is long and the night, the night is yours alone,<br />When you're sure you've had enough of this life, well hang on.<br />Don't let yourself go, everybody cries and everybody hurts sometimes ...<br /><br />Everybody hurts. Take comfort in your friends.<br />Everybody hurts. Don't throw your hand. Oh, no. Don't throw your hand<br />If you feel like you're alone, no, no, no, you are not alone.<br /><br />The insistent refusal of the last line quoted achieves the a realistic rather than an evasive confrontation with the wish to end it all. It is truth so sheer it seems almost apostolic in its quintessence: you are not alone.<br /><br />There are lesser gems. They own a penultimate ranking not because of inherent deficiency but because `Everybody Hurts' is too damn good to brook much competition. Consider `Sweetness Follows', an exquisite look backwards at the absurdity of family. The conclusion is memorable:<br /><br />It's these little things, they can pull you under.<br />Live your life filled with joy and thunder.<br />Yeah, yeah, we were altogether<br />Lost in our little lives.<br /><br />Oh. Oh. Ah.<br /><br />Oh, oh, but sweetness follows.<br />Oh, oh, but sweetness follows.<br /><br />The band's odd and persistent narrative Jones gets some satisfaction in  `Monty got a raw deal'. Without a context, this narrative stream may prove impossible to navigate. Still, the sound is gorgeous.<br /><br />Similar things can be said of `Nightswimming' and `Find the River'.<br /><br />'Enigmatic' goes a long way towards explaining R.E.M.'s deep and sturdy appeal. In their trajectory to date, this album was a milestone. It is still a remarkable musical  moment these many years later.let yourself go, everybody cries and everybody hurts sometimes ...

B00125WAWS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  Yes, I admit that I have enjoyed Denzel Washington on the screen since his St. Elsewhere days, but this movie offers so much beyond Denzel's very fine performance.<br /><br />This story is adapted from the true story set in 1935 of Wiley College, a small but excellent college for African-American students (although that term did not exist at the time of the story).  The characters on the team and the events are adapted (some are real, others are composites, some made up) to tell a powerful story.  Does it matter that the climactic battle with Harvard in the movie was against USC in real life?  And the Samantha Booke character is based on the real life Henrietta Wells who was on the 1930 debate team.<br /><br />Washington plays Melvin B. Tolson, who was the real life debate coach.  Actually, he was a brilliant poet and political activist who taught debate to use it as a tool in his activism.  What I really enjoyed about this portrayal of Tolson is that it neither denies his activism nor wears his radical views on its sleeve.  These views are acknowledged and put in the context of the social struggle for racial and economic equality for African Americans.  The issues the movie takes on are not about abstract theory, but the fight of those a generation from slavery to teach young brilliant minds and give them the tools they need to join the struggle for equality.  I found the reminders of what life in Texas (and American generally) in 1935 to be powerful and important to remember.  In fact, I think it is incredibly important to show this to young people who have never seen racism so plainly.<br /><br />Do not think that because this is about a debate team that it is a dull or abstract movie.  This is a passionate, fiery film that involves us emotionally while engaging us in our own intellectual debate with the film, with our own ideas, with out views about how society as evolved since the 1930s.  The characters are well drawn and finely portrayed.<br /><br />Forest Whitaker is terrific as Dr. James Farmer Sr. who ran Wiley in those years and was the father of the young 14 year old debater who grew up to found C.O.R.E. and lived a life committed to securing social justice for African Americans.  Nate Parker plays Henry Lowe in a way that reflects the character's intelligence, talent, and fragile emotional state.  Jurnee Smollett gives Samantha Booke intelligence, fire, and wit to spare.  John Heard is fine in the thankless job of the sheriff doing the bidding of the local racist powers that be.  And of course, Denzel Washington is superb as an actor in this movie, but deserves real praise as its director.  Oprah Winfrey produced it and deserves credit for giving us a moving and informative film.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI 48103Whitaker is terrific as Dr. James Farmer Sr. who ran Wiley in those years and was the father of the young 14 year old debater who grew up to found C.O.R.E. and lived a life committed to securing social justice for African Americans.

0061367036|5.0|This book is awesome.  It really helps you get a better understanding of the monsters, spirits, demons and ghouls that are a part of the show.  If you are unsure about something or you are just curious to learn more about the monsters, then you should invest in this book.  It's fun to read because later, when you watch the show, you can say \\"Hey! I know that too!\\".
B000W4D94I|4.0|I have always been a fan of this cheesy movie due to it's awesome special effects. It wasn't disappointing, the picture, the sound, the effects all look and sound great. I feel that it is a big improvement over the initial DVD release that was marred with artifacting and poor picture quality. If you own a Blu Ray and like this show it is worth adding to your collection. I feel I should mention that the extras here are not much to write home about.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Honestly regardless of what people summarize My Chemical Romances 'true' genre to be, one thing is for certain \\"The Black Parade\\" is amongst the top albums available. From production to intricacy, to the depth each song brings to the table, and lastly the high replay value the album fortifies.<br /><br /> I listen to everything, Jazz, Metal, Rock, Blues, Classical, Hardcore etc, and still this album remains a staple in my collection. Upon receiving it Oct,31,2006 I was hooked.<br /><br />Starting off with reminiscence to Pink Floyd's \\"In The Flesh\\", \\"The End\\" is truly only the beginning. A all too sarcastic yet dark tone alerts one that this is going to be a conceptual album (as it connects so nicely with proceeding songs and lyrical content), the pulsing bleeps show signs of fading. Abruptly \\"Dead!\\" follows directly where \\"The End\\" left off with a flat lining monitor, now shifting to an oddly deranged upright beat. \\"Dead!\\" has a Beatles like outro, although they swap the friendly lyrics a Beatles tune would incorporate for chiming chants of life (and death). Next in line is the 'dark s&eacute;ance below' solemn yearning song \\"This Is How I Disappear\\". \\"Sharpest Lives\\" is amongst one of my favorites really bass heavy, cynical but redemptive taunting lyrics.<br /><br />The contrast is great as \\"Welcome To The Black Parade\\" marches upon us with militant drums and the first sub hooking notes. The song takes on a Queen like quality which is phenomenal. As the song paints a picture it's<br />a ever progressing one at that. Combining a thematic intro with a pop-punk sound and making it sound marvelous is quite a feat. The mourning \\"I Don't Love You\\" feels cold, hollow, and upsetting. \\"House Of Wolves\\" is the hard rocker of the album. \\"Cancer\\" is the tearjerker of the album, focusing upon simplicity with piano to intently focus on the vocal and upsetting reality of the matter. \\"Mama\\" can be interpreted in so many different scenarios and perspectives even each of the band members see it differently. \\"Mama\\" is the epic, \\"Mama\\" is the nauseating disturbing song of the album.It plays with war like themes and factious carnival tones. The last minute is truly disturbing, from the siren like sounds, to the chorus in the back round. Screeching notes randomly jerking in and out and Liza Minelli's singing exports this to a higher realm of layering. After such a powerful song you get the slower repetitive \\"Sleep\\". \\"Teenagers\\" stirred a bit of controversy upon the time its music video was released, the controversy can easily be linked to the lyrical content. Probably not the best time to release a song a bout tormented gun wielding teens. The song is a chiseling tune, crisply power chord driven.<br /><br />Reeling toward the end we get to the all too fatigued song \\"Disenchanted\\", sad song really. Revealing a burnt out persons views and tying it ironically to a nice radio single ready package. While the acoustic plucking the remaining notes feels like a true ending to an album it isn't in this case. MCR have made room for an upbeat ending \\"Famous Last Words\\". It's as thematic as \\"Welcome To The Black Parade\\" and is the final link to the stories resolution. Truly an inspiring song, one of the best sung endings I've ever herd.<br /><br />While MCR are claimed to be emo listen to the lyrics, their is always a glimpse of light in the Black Parade. And through it all, the rise and fall MCR have created a conceptual masterpiece capable of ascending the ranks up their with \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Tommy\\".

B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Though I've only been buying her CDs since \\"Ray of Light\\" I've been kind of a fan from the start, generally liking her radio hits enough to listen but never buying anything because I knew she wasn't consistent. Sad to say, \\"Hard Candy\\" is the least consistent of her latest batch. If you think that three songs (\\"Candy Shop\\", \\"4 Minutes\\" and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\") are worth the price of a whole CD, go for it. I can't fathom why this disc is so weak other than the suspicion that it was merely an obligatory act of commerce to finish her contract with Warner's rather than a fully felt piece of art. Still love her though. She looks great.

Kelby's work here is a perfect match to what I was seeking.  He is very much the professional, as his photographs and credentials attest.  Despite his lofty status however, he comes across as very personal in these entertaining, informative pages.  He shows a quirky sense of humor over and over, which I admire in dealing with a subject that could easily be over-technical.  He also gives information that is practical -- I found myself again and again taking my camera and seeing exactly how I would use the tips he provided.<br /><br />Kelby gets an easy five stars here -- I'd give six if they were available!  I've got his second volume on this same subject, and look forward to reading more of what he has to share.
B00164KYS2|5.0|As a big fan of the TV series I was not disappointed.  The movie seems to seamlessly continue where the tv series left off without missing a beat.  The chemistry between the ladies is as strong as ever and Chris Noth aka John (Big) really does a great job.  In the story each woman goes through their own crisis, Carrie with Big, Miranda with Steve, Charlotte with confronting Big about Carrie and Samantha with her decision to leave her old promiscuous ways behind.  The movie is a little long but never gets boring.  The windup left me hoping for a sequel!
B000006TRV|5.0|I was about 16 when this album was released, it became an anthem for me and my friends.  The album and then the film transformed our lives and we didn't even know it at the time.  All we really knew is that it was very, very good and we knew then (even as teens) that it was a masterpiece.  The last great collaboration by the four remaining members post-Barrett.  The Wall wasn't meant to be radio-friendly, however, the decaying AOR stations made many of the individual songs radio-friendly by means of minimal editing.  Anyone who knows this work can tell you that any one song taken from the album can stand alone but the original color is lost if not consumed as a whole with all the parts intact.<br /><br />No need to go on-and-on about this cornerstone of modern pop music, just give it a listen, judge for yourself.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|In any other case, the fact that seeing a 64-year-old man bend down, pick up his hat, and put it on is one of the most exciting images this side of the millennium would be a dismal statement about the films being released.  This is a special case, though, because it's not just any 64-year-old man picking up his hat, and it's not just any hat, either.  It's Dr. Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones, Jr., and he's picking up his trademark fedora, easily the most iconic hat in cinematic history.  After nearly twenty years of waiting, Indiana Jones has returned for his fourth adventure: \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\"    A lot has happened since we last joined Indy for an adventure.  Off-screen, that was 1989.  On-screen, it was 1938.  Indy was still young and devilishly handsome, and though he was still having run-ins with Nazis, America wasn't involved in World War II yet.  It's painful to realize that in the time it took for \\"Crystal Skull\\" to arrive, we missed all of the 1940s, including Indy's involvement with World War II (which would certainly have been something to see), and most of the 1950s.  (That doesn't include Harrison Ford's brief guest-stint as a fifty-year-old Indiana Jones on \\"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\\" in 1993.)  In \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\\" set in 1957, Indy is getting up there in age, and the Cold War is in full swing.    That means that, inevitably, a lot of the so-called fans of the series' previous entries will not be pleased with the new film.  They would like the Indy they grew up: a young, dashing, restless womanizer.  Those fans are living in Neverland.  There's no way \\"Crystal Skull\\" will satisfy them, because it's not another adventure of Indiana Jones in the 1930s.  Hard as it to accept - and it seems to be harder for some people to accept than others - there will never be another one of those.  They're over.  Those fans have grown older, and their hero has too.  Those people who go into the theatre expecting a fourth1930s-style Indiana Jones movie will be sorely disappointed.    Those who seek a new Indiana Jones movie, on the other hand, needn't worry.  The same smug, wisecracking, clever, and very human American hero that we know and love is back.  If anything, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is a savage attack on ageism.  Yeah, Indy's joints are a little creakier than they used to be, but he can still run with the best of them.  And I mean run.  Watch Harrison Ford move in this movie.  This guy is 64 years old!  (And before you say \\"stunt double,\\" Ford did an enormous amount of his own stunts.)  At Ford's request (!), screenwriter David Koepp inserted a number of jokes about Indy's age into the film, to acknowledge the fact that the Man with the Hat has added a few rings to his tree since last we saw him.  The filmmakers don't pretend that Indy hasn't aged, but they try (successfully) to accentuate the fact that that doesn't mean a darn thing.    And it really doesn't.  Harrison Ford is as spectacular as he's ever been.  He has the same mischievous twinkle in his eye - watch for it in the opening sequence, you can see it - and the same charming grin.  He's in excellent shape for his age, since, according to Ford, he's been trying to stay in shape for another Indiana Jones movie since they filmed the last one (George Lucas' original deal with Paramount stated that five films would be produced).  Seeing Ford in the opening of the film is enough to transform the most masculine of adult males into the same bleary-eyed little boy they were when they saw the original film, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" back in '81.  Indy has grown up with us, fortunately.  Though he does have a love interest in the film, it's an old flame.  He's not running around with women half his age (unlike his real-life counterpart, Mr. Ford, who has been in a highly-publicized and apparently very happy relationship with \\"Ally McBeal\\" star Calista Flockhart for the last decade).  He's learned a bit from his past adventures, too.  He is only a few steps from being the same sort of wise old man his father was in \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\\" a fact referred to by a very clever allusion to \\"Last Crusade\\" around the middle of the film.    Though Ford's aging shoulders prove more than sturdy enough to support the film, he has a supporting cast as colorful as his adventures.  It's really a delight to see Karen Allen, who was a prominent and very well-liked actor from her first major role, in 1978's \\"Animal House,\\" until the release of \\"Scrooged\\" in 1988.  Many Indy fans have long held that Allen's character from \\"Raiders\\" was Indiana Jones' one true love, and those people will be jumping out of their seats and whipping on to the theater's fans when they see how wonderfully the filmmakers have treated Allen in this film.  The chemistry between she, Ford, and Shia LeBouf - yes, he's in this one, there's no escaping him in blockbusters now - is surprising.    LeBouf is a pleasure.  He provides a lot of the comic relief, which he does with the same natural grace which has made him the hottest young actor in Hollywood.  Steven Spielberg has taken a lot of flak for dressing LeBouf up as a \\"painfully obvious\\" homage to Marlon Brando in \\"The Wild One,\\" but it works.  It's funny, it's a nice little wink to that picture, and that's all it's supposed to be.    The highlight of the supporting cast is Cate Blanchett.  Are you surprised?  Blanchett's portrayal of unstoppable and determined Russian agent Irina Spalko, clearly based upon the character of Rosa Klebb from \\"From Russia with Love,\\" is hilarious, intriguing, and right on the spot.  If one desires anything more from the cast, it's that her role had been expanded.    As for the film itself, well, if there's anything wrong with it, it's the script.  The rough story, concocted by George Lucas, is interesting.  The script, on the other hand, is pieced together from previous scripts by writers like Jeff Nathanson (who receives story credit with Lucas) and, more than anyone else, Frank Darabont (the man who brought us \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\"), and it shows.  David Koepp, who also crafted the scripts for everything from \\"Jurassic Park\\" to \\"Spider-Man,\\" tries his best, but his script is ultimately sort of a Frankenstein's monster, full of great ideas and great scenes that don't quite slide together into one cohesive whole, and filled with some very questionable dialogue.  Oh, if only they'd gone with Darabont's script!  Word on the street is it was brilliant; Spielberg reportedly was head-over-heels crazy about it.  Koepp's script isn't bad, it just goes off occasionally, and when it does, it's enough to throw one off for a minute.    Spielberg's directing won't throw anybody off, though.  Those pesky nihilists who have been crying like banshees that Spielberg's lost it should be silenced by this movie.  Spielberg shoots just like he did in the `80s, back when no one was shooting better.  Surprisingly, he shines the most in the action sequences, which are incredible.  They are by far the most exciting action sequences this side of the millennium (yes, better than those in the damn \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" movies!).  They're also some of the most over-the-top, a trait Spielberg recognizes and even exploits.  Among the sequences: Indiana Jones battles Russians in Area 51, is chased by KGB agents through his college campus, and survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a led-lined refridgerator.     If you're thinking this all sounds like hogwash, this isn't the film for you.  The only problem with this movie is that people seem to be expecting something deep or even something realistic, like Spielberg's last movie, \\"Munich.\\"  That's exactly what the Indiana Jones movies are NOT about.  These films were created by George Lucas as homages to the five-minute serials of the 1930s, or ridiculous old Charlton Heston adventures.  They're meant to be over-the-top, they're meant to be colorful, they're meant to be silly and unbelievable.  They exist for one sole reason: to entertain.  And if one realizes that, one comes to realize that these movies are brilliant.    After all, the Indiana Jones movies are widely regarded as the greatest action-adventure series in cinematic history.  Expectations aren't necessarily too high for this film, they're just off the mark.  The characters have aged and even grown, but anyone who expects anything deeper than the previous films best turn right around and rent \\"Youth Without Youth.\\"  The cast is superb, Spielberg is at his finest, and, in his mid-60's, Indiana Jones still can whip with the best of them.  What more could you ask for?
1582701709|5.0|A compelling read, as soon as I finished it I started again at the begining.  I am ordering additional copies for close friends and family.  The person that suggested I read this is a very close friend who is reading it again for the third time.  This little book, which is a very easy read, has the power to change your life...and change it for the much better!  I highly recomend this book to anyone of any age and in any circumstance.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I asked some friends recently if I was crazy for actually enjoying this movie, and while the majority told me that I was indeed crazy I found solace in the fact that a select few (my smarter friends w/w) shared my adoration for this film.  No, `The Other Boleyn Girl' is not perfect and it is not brilliant but it is entertaining and passionate and quite memorable.  I find much disgust with the way that this film is being advertised now that the DVD release is close at hand (today, right?); the film being paraded off as if it were nothing more than a period version of `Gossip Girl'.<br /><br />`The Other Boleyn Girl' is much more than that, and it deserves to be regarded as such.<br /><br />Telling the fictionalized true story of the Boleyn sisters and their effect on the King of England, `The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without its fare share of drama.  The two sisters couldn't be any different.  Anne is the eldest.  She is outgoing and fresh and extremely charismatic.  She is the apple of her father's eye, the one he invests his hopes and dreams in.  Mary is a stark contrast to her sister.  She is simpler; doe-eyed and quiet.  She is reserved and shy which translates into a warmth that is most becoming.  She may not be immediately noticeable, but once she catches your eye you are swept up in her mystery.<br /><br />The film opens on the wedding day of Mary Boleyn.  She is happy and hopeful in what her new life will bring her.  Her sister Anne is equally excited, so gleeful at the opportunity to share in Mary's day with her.  But then the mood shifts as Anne is summoned before her father and Uncle and given a most interesting and surprising commission.  It is becoming local gossip that King Henry is unhappy with his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and her inability to produce for him a make heir.  Anne's Uncle suggests that she make herself available to the King when he comes to visit so that she may become his mistress, which will of course mean good things for the Boleyn family.  Anne accepts the request, with disastrous consequences.  Anne's personality is abrasive and strong, and while this serves as an immediate draw it actually pushes the King away and into the arms of Mary.  When Henry decides that he wants to make Mary his mistress instead of Anne he sparks a jealous rage that destroys not only the Boleyn family but leaves its stain amidst the entire empire.<br /><br />The first thing one will notice about `The Other Boleyn Girl' is that on the surface it is a beautiful film.  The set designs are flawless, the costumes are radiant (even more so than last years `Elizabeth' debacle) and the cinematography is stunning.  But focusing on these mere facets of the films larger picture would suggest that this film relies on surface value alone, which is not the case.  Underneath the beautiful exterior lies a gritty story that is told wonderfully (for the most part) and is littered by some superb performances.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman tackle the roles of dueling sisters Mary and Anne.  Portman may be the most flamboyant and may garner the most immediate attention, but it's Johansson's brittle and soft performance that truly stole my admiration.  Portman makes Mary a showboat, a canvas for scene stealing antics, which work to the nature of her character.  She has the silky sensuality down pat and works it to produce magic with the audience; drawing them in with her wispy words and her piercing stare.  Johansson instead builds a trust with the audience by creating a likable and compassionate character out of Mary.  We watch as she slowly allows her guards to fall, her pain and suffering exposed for us to see as she is mistreated and walked all over all for a crown that doesn't even fit.  Scarlett says more with her eyes than anyone else within this film can mutter.<br /><br />Eric Bana is a great actor who really needs more high profile film roles.  He manages to make King Henry a desirable man (he truly is beautiful to look at) but the film is ultimately uninterested in him and thus he becomes cast aside at the focus of the two Boleyn girls.  He doesn't quite yet have the commanding presence of some of his peers (I can only imagine how amazing Russell Crowe would have been in this role) and so he suffers from lack of interest.  His performance is good; great even in moments (when he unleashes himself on Anne towards the end I finally took real notice of this man) but he never truly becomes the `reason' we are watching the film.<br /><br />The supporting cast, while never given much to do, manages to deliver to the best of their abilities.  Jim Sturgess especially is heartbreaking as the sister's brother George, and Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are memorable as the Boleyn parents; especially Thomas who allows her pain and disapproval be made known to her husband and brother.<br /><br />My main complaint with `The Other Boleyn Girl' is that as the film progresses the dialog and situations start to get repetitive.  I understand that if pregnancies and miscarriages were what happened then you have to include them, but I feel that the film could have found better ways to go about it.  The repetitive nature caused the film to lag a bit towards the end.  Some have noted that the film feels a bit soap-operaish, but I didn't really get that.  Sure, it's not as high profile or as richly stern as some period classics, but the film is serious and dark and maintains that same aura throughout.<br /><br />Like I said, I wholly enjoyed this film.  Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but it is far from rubbish as far as I am concerned.  The performances are rich (the accents are not as badly uneven as some would have you believe) and the film is altogether a beautiful visual experience.  The story is a moving and painful one, and I felt that director Justin Chadwick crafted an accessible and entertaining film that does not disappoint; at least not in my book.interested in him and thus he becomes cast aside at the focus of the two Boleyn girls.

0140449337|5.0|Those turned off by older translations of \\"Meditations\\" containing all the  \\"thys\\" and \\"thous\\" (as I was) need wait no longer....Gregory Hays has saved the day.     This is an excellent and very readable version of the ancient Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius' personal notebooks and musings, and it can be extremely valuable to the inner seeker.    Personal responsiblity in every aspect of life is emphasized, as is the acceptance of death and the position that we are free to leave this Earth whenever we choose (a very heavy viewpoint for some). Much has been made of the \\"bleak\\" worldview of Marcus, but in my opinion, it's not bleak to see things as they are, just....realistic.    I highly recommend this book to all who want to learn to look within (and without) in a more effective way.
B00104W8T6|5.0|This CD is chock full of humorous lyrics and catchy tunes, plus a little bit of indie spirit to get you feeling Juno-esque.  It's great for car rides and just listening to on your ipod, with your sweatshirt hood tossed over your head as you walk down the sidewalk.  If you've seen the movie, it's great to relate the songs to the corresponding scenes, which makes \\"Anyone else but you\\" all the more sweet.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I purchsed their first album \\"I Brought You my Bullets, You brought you me your love\\", and I was taken aback my how great these guys are. So as soon as \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" was released, I ran out and bought it. I was NOT disappointed at all, amazing album. Every song on that album is beautiful. Gerard Way has an beautiful voice, and does an awesome job of making you feel the emotion of the music, I mean really feel it. This being their sophomore album, they definitely didn't hit that sophomore slump as most bands do. My favorite song on the album is \\"Thank You For The Venom\\", the words to that song are BEAUTIFUL. Especially \\"You'll never make me leave ,I wear this on my sleeve Give me a reason to believe.\\" \\"Gimme all your poison, and gimme all your pills, gimme all your hopeless hearts and make me ill. You're running after something that you'll never kill, if this is what you want then fire at will.\\" There is definitely a story behind this album, and you can hear the story in each individual song. This album takes you on this amazing journey. It's beautifully put together, and I listen to it just about everyday :)!
B0000TG9E2|4.0|Alice in Wonderland is renowned for it's odd and satirical nature, while still appealing to kids who are highly entertained by the disappearing Cheshire cat, the wackiness of the Mad Hatter, and the wrath of the Queen of Hearts.   The songs are cute and Disney-esque, and Alice's adventures inspire all of the many imaginative people out in the world.
B000002LEM|4.0|The second of the Van Hagar era albums is fairly similar to the first one.  The title is a jab at David Lee Roth's first solo album \\"Eat Em And Smile\\".  The keyboards are toned down a bit on this one, compared to the last two and the guitar more up front for the most part.  Hagar's lyrics are a mix of attempted profundity and juvenile sexist schlock like the first single \\"Black And Blue\\".  The album produced several huge hits most notably \\"Finish What Ya Started\\", and \\"When It's Love\\" both slightly atypical of Van Halen's usual fare.  Hager includes what has become one of his theme songs in the infectious \\"Cabo Wabo\\" where he now famously owns the famous Cabo Wabo Cantina nightclub in Cabo San Lucas Mexico.  For the most part if you like \\"5150\\" you will probably like this one as well.  I rate them about the same with Hagar in fine voice and Van Halen screaming on guitar.  Good stuff for the most part, but not great.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Seems that most of the people giving this album 1's and 2's have yet to hear the album. They feel satisfaction in giving an artist bad marks because their lives are empty and boring. Anyways, on to the album which to date is the best Alanis Morissette album. There are plenty of gems on this album including:    Not As We is a devastating song and if you have ever felt any sort of heartache you can resonate with it. So powerful and raw and in your face.     Torch just like Not As We is a beautiful song where Alanis describes the things she misses from her significant other after the end of a relationship.    Giggling Again for No Reason which sounds nothing like what Alanis has done in the past. Its one of those songs where best heard driving fast with the windows down with the hair flowing through your hair.    Tapes is a gorgeous track and classic Alanis with lyrics that include \\"I am someone easy to leave\\" and \\"I am too exhausting to be loved\\" these are some of her best lyrics ever written.    Incomplete is a great and lullaby type song which is a great ending to a wonderful album.     Those are just some of the song  but the whole album from start to finish is great. This is the first cd in awhile where I have to skip through tracks. Its a must and its great to have Alanis back!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is the best example of the human heart, and all its emotions translated onto the screen. The only other show that comes close is Northern Exposure. Probably why I have them both on my shelf, right next to eachother.<br /><br />The actors were simply born for these roles. In particular, I love Tom Amandes as Dr. Abbot!! He is just priceless. But I suppose one could say that about all the characters in a little town called Everwood. It's full of heart, its human, its love, its beautiful.<br /><br />So turn off all the nonsense and mind-numbing dribble currently inhabiting TV land and get yourself a train  ticket to Everwood.<br /><br />You'll have found home ...<br /><br />And you won't come back!

0446402389|5.0|Tom Rob Smith has written a mystery novel that is part history, deeply moving, terrifying, sad and basically impossible to put down. If you think that a serial killer novel set in 1953 Stalinist Russia can't hold your interest, then think again. Smith's characters are memorable and fascinating. There are so many stunning plot twists that I won't reveal them but you won't see the next one coming. I read lots of mystery stories but this is the best I've read in years. You will be drawn into Leo and his wife Raisa as they struggle with their own morality and the insensitivity of the state. Can they do what is right and stay alive? Don't skip a word and you'll find yourself completely engrossed in this scary, informative thriller.

0385340567|2.0|I have read and all of, and throughly enjoyed all of Lee Child's novels. This story bogged down with too much information about a marginal storyline,but, as we all do, we hang in there because we know it will have a point, eventually. I was saddened to have to hear Lee Child's anti war stance through Jack Reacher right at the end. Lee Child should be a man and show his dis-respect for the military and the president out in the open where we can all hear him, then we will know what we are getting before we spend money on his books. Nobody likes the war but these novels are, for me, entertainment,escape,etc. not avenues for me to learn the authors hidden agenda.
0060730552|5.0|What an experience. Miraculous is the correct word. Other reviewers have discribed the situation for you. I will just concure that this is a must read.     Much better than Jon Krakauers - Into Thin Air because it's more intimate imo. Into Thin air is about a big expedition up Mount Everest. Touching the Void is about two men.     Two men together, Simon Yates attemping to save Joe Simpsons life by slowly lowering him down the Mt. 300 ft. at a time.   You can just feel the agonising Simon Yates went thru. I mean he stayed and hung on to Simpson for as long as was humanly possible. I really felt for him.     Than it was one extremely determined soul fighting to live.     Some nice pictures too.     Highly recommended

B0018SWA56|5.0|First of all I applaud Emily Giffin for coming up with this creative idea for a sequel; not only is it a great story but also a great way to sell books. The characters are well thought out, relatable, and most of all - human.     Her writing style is witty and humorous but not over the top. I found it to be enjoyable throughout and as with Something Borrowed; I didn't put it down until I finished reading it. In fact, I found it to be such a good pastime; I purchased a copy of both books for my close friends. I would truly recommend this author to anybody.    As a side note, I would like to mention that this book is indeed a sequel. I'm sure that it can be enjoyed without having read Something Borrowed, but the story would not be nearly as entertaining. In order to appreciate Darcy's transformation, you must understand the road she has traveled.
193355021X|5.0|This book, first published in 1946, explains common fallacies (a false or mistaken idea) that are particularly common in the field of economics and public policy. At the very start of the book Mr. Hazlitt explains:<br /><br />Economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident. The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics, mathematics or medicine -- the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see, interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. While certain public policies would in the long run benefit everybody, other policies would benefit one group only at the expense of all other groups. The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for then plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible.<br /><br />In addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.<br /><br />At first it seems as though not much has changed since the end of World War II. What has changed, though, is the scope of the dangers Mr. Hazlitt identifies. That's because government is much expanded and more assertive today than when this book was written. In 1946 the New Deal was not very old, and the tremendous expansion of government social programs was still in the future. We should take these lessons as even more important today.<br /><br />It is the overlooked consequences that cause harm. They are overlooked sometimes because they are difficult to see, as in the broken window fallacy explained by Frederic Bastiat and also in this book. They are also \\"overlooked\\" because, as Mr. Hazlitt tells us, one group wants special favors from the government, and although there is no way to grant these favors without harming some other group, the favor-seeking group will seek to hide, obfuscate, muddle, or minimize the bad effects. At the same time they promote the policy as good for everyone. This is largely the job that lobbyists perform, and billions are spent on it each year. That's because a powerful government has the ability to bestow valuable favors, those favors being paid for by someone else, someone often not easily seen.<br /><br />An example of overlooked secondary consequences is government spending. When government spends, it means it must tax or borrow. What government spends is not available for individuals to spend. When we see magnificent public works (say a new downtown arena in Wichita), we don't see all the things that would have been bought had the government not taxed to build the public work. We see the jobs created by the public work -- all the construction workers that will be building the new arena -- but we don't see the jobs destroyed because people had to reduce their spending elsewhere.<br /><br />Foreign trade is a case where people often fail to grasp the complete picture. We often see exports as something good for our economy, while imports are seen as bad. Imported things are things that American workers can't compete with, and so American jobs are lost, it is often said. But as Mr. Hazlitt says: \\"It is exports that pay for imports. The greater exports we have, the greater imports we must have, if we ever expect to get paid. The smaller imports we have, the smaller exports we can have. Without imports we can have no exports, for foreigners will have to funds with which to buy our goods.\\" So those wanting restrictions on imports are also -- although they do not say this, either because they do not recognize it or it doesn't matter to them -- calling for fewer exports.<br /><br />In recent years we have been told that our is a \\"consumer-driven\\" economy, fueled by people tapping their home equity that accumulated from increased home values, or spending by going into debt. It is as though if consumers started saving rather then spending on immediate consumption, the American economy would collapse. But Mr. Hazlitt tells us that \\"saving is only another form of spending.\\" After all, what is done with money that is saved? Today, few put their savings under the mattress. Instead, it is loaned to a bank or invested. Then it is spent on capital goods, which businesses use to increase their productive capability. The key fact is that businesses spend it. And, they spend it on capital goods that either expand their capacity to produce, or decease their present costs of production. Either way, that is good for everyone. It means more jobs, and better jobs. But this saving is derided as not being \\"productive.\\"<br /><br />As a conclusion Mr. Hazlitt tells us:<br /><br />And this is our lesson in its most generalized form. For many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone, as consumer no less than producer, are considered.<br /><br />To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments: that is the goal of economic science.<br /><br />This is a very valuable book, which while dated a bit, cuts through the fog and haze of economics and public policy and lets us understand the effects of our government's policies.mports we have, the smaller exports we can have.

Awesome workout, with little extra equipment (dumbbells) and very efficient use of time. I would highly recommend this to anyone short on time, but looking for a work-up-a-sweat workout.  On a side note, I signed up for her internet diet plan... it's a waste of time and money.  Just do the workout.

1416955070|5.0|Over the course of a single day, Clary's whole life changes. When she goes to Pandemonium Club, she sees the murder of a blue-haired boy by three strange-looking teens wielding strange-looking weapons. But what she can't believe is seeing the body disappear before her eyes, as if it was never there in the first place. And after that, Clary's mom disappears and Clary is attacked by a mysterious creature, only to be saved by one of the strange teens from the nightclub. And with that, Clary is dragged into a dangerous world she never imagined existed.    Clary finds out that she's connected to this new world not only by the teens who saved her, but by her mother and her mother's friend Luke. But since her mother's gone and Luke refuses to help her, Clary has nowhere to turn to except the mysterious teens, who reveal themselves to be Shadowhunters, an elite group of people whose job is to kill demons on earth. Soon, her best friend Simon is dragged in too, and Clary finds herself in the midst of a struggle to find the Mortal Cup before a very dangerous and unstable Shadowhunter named Valentine does.    It is very difficult for me to describe my initial reaction when I finished this book, but it goes along the lines of gasping, screaming, and ranting - but in a good way. City of Bones was one of the absolute best books I have ever read; it ranks up with Twilight and A Great and Terrible Beauty. It is a combination of some of my most favorite stories ever to create an awesome and unforgettable super-story.    I really love how Cassandra Clare incorporates the underworld into modern-day New York City. The world she creates in City of Bones is one of dangerous fun, and I was absolutely thrilled to go along for the ride. There is nonstop action throughout the whole book and I think that Jace is almost amazing enough to rival Edward Cullen in his sexiness. The only past of the book I was opposed to was how Clary and Jace ended up being related, because it ruined their chemistry.    City of Bones should be mandatory reading for every teen, and I would recommend it to everyone, especially fans of the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer, the A Great and Terrible Beauty series by Libba Bray, the Blue Bloods series by Melissa de la Cruz, among other supernatural books. I guarantee that no one who picks this novel up will be able to put it down until they've finished this amazing story, and I know I cannot wait until I pick of the sequel, City of Ashes.    [...]

1416914293|5.0|Readers are brought back into the exciting world introduced in Cassandra Clare incredible City of Bones. Clary's life can no longer be normal. Her mother is in a coma, her father is deranged, her best friend may no longer be human, and she has feelings that she shouldn't have toward her brother Jace. Someone is murdering Downworlder children and has stolen the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword. Clary and Jace suspect it to be Valentine with another evil plot, and they know they must stop him. Their world is on the brink of war. Soon, they are swept up into another dangerous adventure as they struggle to save the ones they love as well as their own lives in this epic power struggle.    If possible, City of Ashes was even better than its prequel City of Bones. The story has non-stop action which kept me on the edge of my seat in suspense. I also highly enjoyed the love tensions among nearly all the characters. The story was just as unforgettable as the first, and the end left me hungering for more. City of Ashes is the type of story that I want to read over and over because it is just such a well-written and amazing story.    The characters in City of Ashes are just incredible. Clary is my hero; she's strong and resourceful, even if she sometimes doubts herself. Jace is an alternate form of Edward Cullen; he's sexy and will give anything to protect the ones he loves. The cast of characters from the Mortal Instruments series are some of my favorite fictional characters ever. They make me wish I could participate in their attractive, although dangerous, world.    I most definitely recommend the Mortal Instruments series to every eager reader out there (if you couldn't already tell from my excited raving). Fans of supernatural series such as the Twilight series or the A Great and Terrible Beauty series, among others, will certainly fall in love with this amazing story. If you've already read City of Bones but not yet its sequel, then get on it! And if youhaven't even begun the series, you'd better get started. I promise you won't regret investing your time in this incredible series.    [...]
B0004Z33F0|3.0|On the heels of the extremely enjoyable [[ASIN:B0015XHP22 Rambo (Special Edition + Digital Copy)]] Sid the Elf decided to finally review Rambo III. Also, due to the recent oppresive heat wave that has crashed upon the North Pole, Sid halucinated and thought he was in an Afghan desert, so Rambo III just felt right. However, while [[ASIN:B0000640S1 First Blood (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0004Z33EQ Rambo: First Blood, Part 2]] were clearly good enough to recieve 5 stars from Sid, Rambo III fell short. Please note that we're talking about the movie here, not the trancendant Rambo III video game on Sega which would recieve roughly 38 out of 5 stars. As always, visit Sid the Elf's Movie World for the Rambo III trailer, all our reviews; and some of our favorite pics, sound clips and videos. If you don't crack up at least 10 times on our site, you don't have a soul. Ok, back to the review.<br /><br />This time, Rambo is somewhere in Asia living in a Buhddhist monestary--now this is true. And, the first appearence in the film by John J. is at a seedy Asian fight club. He is stick-fighting some guy who looks like he just missed the cut to be in The Samoans. Anyway, Rambo is eventually approached by his old mentor, played by Richard Crenna. He needs Rambo to help him out with a mission in Afghanistan against the Russians. Rambo declines and Crenna predictably gets captured during the mission. So, word gets back to Rambo and he decides to...yep, infiltrate the camp where Crenna is a prisoner and bust him out. Rambo gets some help along the way from Bilo and Bilo's son. They give him some stellar backup, ammo and teach him a new sport. Aparently, in Afganistan, the sport of choice isn't anything remotely cool. No, it's mounting a horse and carrying a gym bag covered in faux fur across a sort of goal line. \\"Like football,\\" Rambo says. Um, yeah Rambo, kinda. This is one of the funniest and best scenes in the entire film. Not a good sign.<br /><br />Now, Rambo makes it to the prison camp. He has to take out roughly 78 guys by himself. But, he has the wonderful old explosive tip arrows, a grenade launcher, and a ton of other awesome weapons. This is great and all, but where were these things being stashed? Did Rambo carry them in his black wife-beater? Were they kept in Bilo's cage? It was just a distracting thought. As in all action movies, the hero has to take out the top bad guy after he takes out the top bad guy's henchman. These were the shining moments in Rambo III, well, except for gym bag-horse football. Rambo takes out the henchman in quite possibly the coolest way in action film history. The henchman has Rambo in a ferocious bear-hug. Rambo wraps some rope around the guy's neck, pulls the pins from the grenades hanging from the guy's jacket, gets out of the bear hug, and kicks the guy down a hole leading to a cave. So, as he's decending into the cave he freakin' blows up! This scene is absolutely awesome. Above all else, if you're on the fence about seeing Rambo III, see it for this scene. If you like action at all, you will love this part. Then there is the little matter of Rambo vs. the head bad guy. He was the warden of the prison camp, the Russian Drumgoole. So, this guy is in a helicopter and Rambo is in a tank. These two are moving towards one another, playing chicken, but neither swerve. Sid would love some feedback on this: When the helicopter and tank crash, is it actually realistic that the guy in the helicopter dies and the guy in the tank walks away merely dazed?<br /><br />Rambo III was a strange entity. It had no descernable plot, terrible acting, and the tired 80's theme of Evil Russians. But, it was a Rambo movie. So, you're guaranteed Stallone and an inordinate amount of explosions which make it watchable. This was an interesting point in Sly's career. Rambo III was preceded by Rambo II, Rocky IV, Cobra, and Over the Top. Impressive. His next film, after Rambo III, was the legendary [[ASIN:B000MEYKEG Lock Up]]. Very impressive. But, after that, Tango&Cash, Rocky V, Oscar(which bombed but isn't awful), and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. Wow. Nobody loves Sly more than Sid, except for maybe Santa, but this is just a laundry list of crap. Not good times for Sly. Did he and Frank try out their famous lounge singing act during this stretch? Anyway, thankfully Sly recovered and got back on track with...um,(scrolling through imdb feverently)...Rambo(2008) was good! We'll give that one to Sly even if it wasn't him in the movie, just some guy in a Stallone mask.after that, Tango&Cash, Rocky V, Oscar(which bombed but isn't awful), and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.

1595141715|5.0|One day Clay Jensen comes home from school to find a shoe box package with no return address. At first he's excited, but when he opens the box, he finds seven cassette tapes. And when he plays them, he finds that they were recorded by a classmate named Hannah Baker, a girl who committed suicide two weeks earlier.    Recorded on the tapes are thirteen reasons why Hannah chose to end her life. The reasons are all linked to specific people, and the tapes are passed onto those people in the order they are on Hannah's list. They are all, in some way, responsible for Hannah's death. Clay stays out the whole night, listening to the sounds of Hannah's voice leading him throughout the town, basically reliving select experiences from Hannah's life that lead up to her decision to end it.    Hannah's narration is interwoven with Clay's actions and memories, which sometimes makes the story confusing to read. However, it does help to better understand both Clay's and Hannah's emotions. Hannah's reasons for suicide are hard to read for Clay, who alternates between blaming himself and blaming Hannah for not letting Clay reach out to her. It was hard for me to read as well, and I cried many times while reading.    For a debut novel, Thirteen Reasons Why is exceptionally well written for such a serious topic. It is often difficult to address things such as suicide because many people don't want to discuss it. However, I think this book was wonderfully written. This novel thoroughly demonstrates the consequences of even the smallest actions and what the piling up of problems can cause, which Hannah refers to as the snowball effect. There are so many life lessons to be learned from this novel. I highly recommend this book because it has truly changed the way I think.    reposted from [...]

B0013FXWX8|4.0|I liked \\"Kung Fu Panda,\\" first for its look, second for its story, and I know that's usually not a good sign. I know that a film that puts style ahead of substance is by default less meaningful, and therefore not worth recommending. But that's being too harsh in this case; \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" is no more and no less than a family film with light-hearted subject matter, about as enjoyable as the average computer-animated film released this time of year. There's no question that the target audience is younger viewers, and indeed, there's plenty here visually for them to take in; not only is the art direction bold and vibrant, the physical comedy is plentiful, as well. As if martial arts never lent itself to comedy--this year alone saw the release of \\"The Forbidden Kingdom,\\" a family-friendly Kung Fu fable that allowed us to laugh along with the story. \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" works in pretty much the same way, probably even better because it's an animated film.    Taking place in ancient China, we're immediately introduced to Po (voiced by Jack Black), a very overweight panda who runs a noodle stand with his bird father (voiced by James Hong). Unbeknownst to him, Po dreams of one day becoming a Kung Fu master, to be respected and adored by every animal living in the Valley of Peace. He wants to be as legendary as the Furious Five, Kung Fu disciples whose various animal styles reflect what they actually are (Viper practices viper-style, Crane practices crane-style, etc.). Po's humdrum life is changed when the elderly Kung Fu master--a turtle named Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim)--chooses him as the next Dragon Warrior; it was during a temple ceremony that drew out the entire village, and Po barely managed to get there at all. The temple, you see, is located at the top of a very tall mountain, and the only way to get there is by climbing thousands of steps. Can you imagine how much energy a fat panda would need to do that?    Po's choosing comes as a shock to the Furious Five: Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie), Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan), Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogen), Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu), and Crane (voiced by David Cross). Each is incredibly skilled in the ways of Kung Fu, yet an untrained, overweight panda has been chosen. No one is more upset about the situation than Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), who had been training the Furious Five for many years. He frantically appeals to Master Oogway, who can only speak in philosophical metaphors; the wise old turtle believes that absolutely nothing happens by accident, and you can never force the natural order of things, no matter how hard you try. Po will meet his destiny and become the next great Dragon Warrior only when Shifu decides to train him. That, of course, can only happen if he believes in him.    The thing is, Po initially doesn't believe in himself; despite his dream of being a Kung Fu master, he knows all too well that he's not ready for this, especially now that the other warriors hate him. The attempts at conventional training are disastrous until Shifu discovers Po's amazing ability to eat. Basically, his Kung Fu skills only emerge when he's after food. Po and Shifu eventually battle over a bowl of dumplings, and I don't think I've ever seen such lightening-fast chopstick maneuvers, in either an animated or a live action film. It gets the most intense when only one is left. Po unconsciously pushes himself to the limit when food is at stake, which isn't so far fetched since pandas are known to gorge themselves, especially in the spring months. Not that anyone will care about that--\\"Kung Fu Panda\\" is about comedy and special effects, not behavioral facts.    In the midst of all this training looms a dangerous threat: a ruthless leopard named Tai Lung (voiced by Ian McShane) has escaped from a maximum-security prison guarded by rhinos. He started out as Shifu's star pupil, but turned evil when Master Oogway refused to declare him the next Dragon Warrior. Now on the loose, Po discovers that only he can stop Tai Lung, meaning he must complete his training in a very short period of time. His final task is to open the Dragon Scroll, something that will supposedly tell him the secret to being the ultimate Kung Fu master.    If this sounds entertaining enough, that's because it is. It does not, however, transcend any recent computer-animated film, least of all in terms of story or characterization. A couple of things baffle the mind, like how it's possible for a tiny mantis or a snake or a crane to be a lethal Kung Fu warrior. And doesn't it make you wonder why Po's father is a bird? Near the end of the film, Po turns to him and says, \\"Sometimes I think I'm not even your son,\\" so at least the filmmakers were well aware of what they were doing. Still, it seems a little too out of place, a little too unmindful of simple logistics like a panda being the offspring of other pandas. I did like the way the film looked, especially during some wide shots showing vast distances between fog-shrouded mountains. The film was projected on a seventy-millimeter screen, which was nice because the breathtaking landscapes weren't overcrowded, even when characters were present. \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" is definitely pretty looking, and while it doesn't tell a substantive story, there's enough there to keep you entertained all throughout.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|The watch looks great and has a good heft to it. The look of a chronograph really sticks out from other watches, and the price is hard to beat on this one. It also seems that Amazon is being serious about the list price. When I received the watch, the band had a price sticker for $350, and you can get it here for under $120.<br /><br />It doesn't get 5 stars because of small issues with the details. First, the manual is not great. It's sufficient, and you can figure everything out, but its just not well written or well organized.<br /><br />The second hand started out off center. This is easy to fix though to get the alignment of all the dials to the correct starting positions.<br /><br />However, the second hand does not align well with the tick marks around the watch. If you are a perfectionist, this may bother you to no end. If you never use the stopwatch feature, you may never care.<br /><br />If you are buying this watch for the looks, its a good buy. It's stylish and keeps time well. If you want a proper chronograph, you may want to look elsewhere.

B000O78KW4|4.0|This second sequel in the Die Hard series brings back Det. John Mclane, this time teamed up with Samuel L. Jackson. The sequel accomplishes to become an independent sequel to the previous entry. the previous entry (Die Harder) tended to make to many references to the first die hard movie. Instead this sequel manages to move on from that.<br /><br /> Unlike the previous installments which take place in Christmas Eve, in this one its unclear on what day it takes place. I for one thought that was a good move from the director. as a matter of fact what makes the sequel work is the return of the first Die Hard (John McTiernan) he knows the character and the setting of these movies; so that's good.<br /><br />The antagonist in this one is Simon Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber. Hans Gruber was the antagonist of the first Die Hard. It first appears as though Simon is out to avenge his brother's death, but it is later revealed that other motives are at work. All of this works in the movie....so why call the movie the \\"weakest\\" in the franchise? Well simple, the movie tries so hard to live up to part one by being independent from part one...\\"But wait you said that being independent from one was a good thing\\" yes I did say that, but there is a difference from being independent and becoming independent. EX: In being independent you are making little or no mentioning of the previous film, the movie is a sequel but goes on its own path, much like a 007 movie or a Romero Zombie movie. That's how I felt Die Hard needed to be. and becoming independent is what this movie tries. for the first hour we have a movie that manages to bring up some points from the first and move on, and the last hour we have an over the top sequel that is so desperately trying to be bigger and better because its Die Hard; oh and did I mention that its with a Vengeance? lol.<br /><br />Anyhow the movie is not bad; in fact it's quite entertaining and has a lot of surprises. It's just that it becomes implausible when it goes overboard. Also anther bothering thing was the editing; it was weak, specifically in the end. I later checked on the special features and it mentions that there was an alternate ending that had to be removed. If they had left it I might have given the movie a higher rating.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ½ OUT OF 5verboard.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|We have five boys, and we are always looking for movies that the whole family can enjoy.  Our oldest is 14, we then have a 12, 9 and 4 year old, the baby can't enjoy a great movie yet, but in time I predict this will be a favorite.    There were some very sophisticated jokes in this film, but there was enough slapstick to keep our younger boys entertained.  The story moved along with enough momentum to keep us all interested, but not so slow that the younger boys lose interest.  My older boys got a kick out of the premise, but the idea that we can be whatever we desire was not lost on them either, and isn't that a fine lesson for anyone to learn/and or remember?    This was a great family movie, and I certainly think it lives up to Pixar's reputation, we are waiting with bated breath for Wall*E.    Check this movie out...you won't be disappointed.

One thing to remember however, is that every one of these books begins slowly, and until you get into the first 2-3 chapters it's slow going.  But do keep reading!<br /><br />The history of Scotland, France, etc., that Ms. Gabaldon attaches to these stories is historically accurate, too.<br /><br />Awesome books by a great writer.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|\\"Cloverfield\\" is an entertaining addition to the \\"creature is attacking the city\\" sci-fi/horror genre, but it is difficult to take it very seriously at all.<br /><br />The concept is promisingly ominous: a group of ordinary people (they aren't though: each and every one of them is a Gap ad, an \\"I'm Too Hip To Be At This Party\\" stereotype) who happened to be recording a friend's departure to Japan (hint hint) on camcorder when, without warning, a terrible catastrophe strikes: a creature of some sort begins demolishing New York City.<br /><br />The chief problem with this is that we cannot believe in any of the characters, not for one second: they are the mediated archetypes of youth.  Hud (T.J. Miller) is the most sympathetic character: he has no pretensions and simply runs through the film trying to keep the \\"hero\\" (Michael Stahl-David) Rob Hawkins from making the most irresponsible decisions possible, which he does anyway.  The creepiest and most effective part of the film, in my opinion, is when the silent but mysterious type, Marlena, is bitten by one of the nasty critters spawned by the hulking hydra which thrashes at the center of civilization: she walks onto camera and says simply: \\"I don't feel good...\\".  Then, something beyond comprehension occurs.<br /><br />The ending is both saccharine, corny, and very effective on the monster side of things: poor Hud makes an unwise decision, after miraculously surviving a full force plane crash with Rob and his irritating Juliet (the whole love story disrupts the mood of Lovecraftian dread, and is the chief flaw of the film) to look straight in the face of the monster: wow, is it ugly.<br /><br />Films like this--missed opportunities for greatness--awaken the desire in me for some imaginary film board that restricts great new concepts to great filmmakers.  Still, a novelty worth giving a look.
0786948523|1.0|If you're a longtime fan of Dungeons & Dragons, this isn't the game for you.    Much of the game's rich history and iconic elements have been sacrificed in an effort to simplify the game to attract new gamers.  The game is far less flexible than 3rd Edition.       Many of the iconic monsters have been drastically altered to fit into a new, unnecessary cosmology and core setting.  Succubi are now devils, despite always being demons, and demons as a whole are now related to elementals.  Angels are no longer exemplars of good.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.    Most of the iconic monsters have had their abilities stripped down to just a handful of powers, and nearly all non-combat abilities are gone.    The names of many of the new creatures and variants are bland.  The flavor text is nearly nonexistant.    Monsters can only improve in a few cookie-cutter roles, such as \\"skirmisher\\", rather than truly advanced to become better at what makes them unique.    Worst of all, many iconic monsters (for example, frost giants) have been left out of the first Monster Manual and reserved for later books.    If you're a fan of the past editions of the game, save your money and wait until next year for Paizo's Pathfinder RPG, which looks more like the heir apparent to the D&D throne.
0385340567|2.0|The latest Jack Reacher novel was a disappointment.  I am a big fan of Lee Child's Reacher novels and bought this book as soon as it was out.  I should have waited for the paperback.  It was definitely not up to Child's previous novels.  Maybe it was too much politics or the typical bad guys: \\"religious conservatives\\", but the story just didn't work.  I thought Reacher's sympathy for the AWOL soldiers didn't ring true to his character.  I hope Child gets Reacher back on track for his next adventure.
0064440346|5.0|In my opinion its hard to grow up in the 80's and not know \\"Frog and Toad\\" it was so popular when I was a kid I don't know anyone that didn't read it and with that I had the name Arnold Lobel branded in my mind since.  So when I saw this I had to give it a try. \\"Owl at home\\" is made up of a handful of little short stories which i find really useful at bedtime cause I can zip through them quickly yet they don't feel rushed and yet amazingly evoke alot of thought and questions afterward.  My daughter is the type to pull out 15 books at bedtime so these are a great way to wrap up the night or read something light.  \\"Tear water tea\\" is my favorite (I find it to be incredibly creative yet true to what you imagine little minds would find sad) cause the images he uses to make himself sad (in order to cry and collect enough tears in a pot for tea) are so cute like spoons that fell behind the stove and are to never be seen again and mornings nobody saw cause they were too busy sleeping! I just love it love it love it I couldn't recommend a beginner book more!

The saga continues as the kings fight their battles to rule.  A few different story plots in this book has your jaw dropping as you get to the end. I do not want to reveal too much and ruin the book for anyone, plus I don't like really long reviews.  Again, this book kept you guessing and interested until the very last page.  I can not even imagine what is in store for book three, but I hope it is as good as the first two books.

1596912863|5.0|As a fan of Shannon Hale's writing I was excited and a bit cautious when I found this book.  There are a lot of books out there that try and rewrite or continue the story of Darcy & Elizabeth.  The only ones I have ever really enjoyed are Pamela Aiden's series -- Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman.       [[ASIN:B000VYY786 FITZWILLIAM DARCY GENTLEMAN: Complete Trilogy - An Assembly Such As This, Duty And Desire, These Three Remain by Pamela Aidan (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman, Volume 1, 2 and 3)]]    So, I approach any book that may tread on Jane Austen's original work with caution.      But Shannon Hale's Austenland doesn't attempt to rework Austen.  It is the story of a 30 something woman with an obsession for Colin Firth as Darcy who attempts to get over that obsession or find her own Darcy by going on a trip to an exclusive period resort, \\"Austenland.\\"      As another reviewer comments, it does make you wish you could do the same, only with a lot of family and friends to keep you company, otherwise, you start to realize you might get hopelessly bored and feel overly constrained in that world for three weeks.      Having spent many a night up watching the entire BBC Pride & Prejudice series, I can relate to the story. I found myself not wanting to put the book down and then not wanting to finish too quickly.  Now that I know the outcome, I am reading it through again and enjoying it just as much.      Married or single, if your heart beats a little faster when you see Colin Firth coming out of the pond at Pemberly, you will likely find a compatriot in Jane Hayes (Miss Erstwhile) in Austenland.    I now await the movie.
0553381687|3.0|I would advise at least trying this book. I started out loving this series, quickly reading through several, but soon as it progressed it became too dark and depressing. I think it was at the 4th one I gave up. I could have stuck it out if there seemed to be a point but it became gratitious and I could see it becoming like Wheel of Time...just going and going...nowhere. Still, it is complex, original and very well-developed characters. The world seems like it could really exist.

B000YPUF9W|3.0|By the time the third instalment of the film adaptations of \\"Resident Evil\\" came about, I had stopped hoping that they were going to make the movies faithful to the games, and this probably saved me a lot a grief: \\"Extinction\\" is the least like any of the classic video game titles, and is generally a bit old-hat when it comes to what you can do with a zombie film...but, for the most part, it manages to be a decent action-adventure.<br /><br />Set some time after its prequel, we find Alice (Milla Jovovich) traipsing an earth that has been devastated and turned to desert by the leaked T-Virus. She meets up with a convoy of survivors headed by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter, \\"Heroes\\") and returning pal Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr, \\"RE: Apocalypse\\"), and after heading off an attack by infected crows, they decide to make route for Alaska, where the infection supposedly hasn't spread yet. In the meantime, the heads of the Umbrella Corporation, hiding underground, seek Alice's blood in hopes of procuring a cure for the epidemic.<br /><br />I must give credit where it's due: Milla Jovovich kicks butt. She alone is the best aspect of this film, and continues to hold the title of greatest female action hero by way of some nifty battle scenes (Alice vs. dogs, Alice vs. zombie horde, Alice vs. Tyrant, etc.). All of the action scenes are thoroughly exhilarating, with the scene where the crows attack being one of the most visually fun-to-watch spectacles I've recently seen.<br />In addition, the desert location works better than I thought it would, and the contrast involved in going from extreme brightness to underground darkness helps create necessary in the film's more edgy scenes.<br /><br />However, when the fighting ceases, so does the fun, and we're left to try and comprehend some of the rather silly choices of the filmmakers: logic-defying bits like nobody noticing that L.J. (Mike Epps, \\"The Fighting Temptations\\") is infected and zombies able to be dropped by a slit throat are the backdrop to the completely aberrant notions of turning zombies domestic and Alice being psychokinetic. Also, the fact that the movie is almost nothing like any of the games continues to bother me: Claire and Wesker (now head of Umbrella) look nothing like their designs, Las Vegas is as alien to the series as Kathmandu, and the entire film feels more like something out of the \\"28 Days Later\\" franchise than \\"Resident Evil\\".<br /><br />While \\"Extinction\\" remains a better-than-average game adaptation, it's a shame that not even the third time could be a charm when it comes to faithfulness. May the upcoming CGI attempt be the definitive one...ly aberrant notions of turning zombies domestic and Alice being psychokinetic.

B000GPI2EK|5.0|Mastodon, at least on Blood Mountain, is all over the place stylistically.  At times sludgy and doomy, frequently thrashy, and more often melodic with tinges of progressive... it's more a seventies vibed hard rock epic than a metal rcord, and I love it.    The vocals are harsher than most rock, veering into metal territory, but still frequently melodic.  Much more melodic than on previous Mastodon outings, and it's a good thing.  The drumming, while extremely busy (and I mean EXTREMELY busy... I swear this dude is an octopus or something) rarely verges into metal cliches... in fact, I recall very little (if even any) double bass rolls or blast beats at all.  That's not a bad thing.  And guitar wise... somebody's been listening to earlier Rush and seventies prog since the last jaunt into the studio, I would say.    All in all, a very HEAVY and accomplished album.  More melodic and rock tinged than earlier Mastodon, very different from most other metal/rock of today, and it just, well... RULES!!!  I've been listening to this disc almost non-stop for ove a year and I have'nt grown tired of it yet.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Until very recently, no one expected something \\"new\\" from an artist. He/she did what he/she did, and, over time, with work and talent and increasing mastery, the art got better and better. But it didn't get \\"different\\" and there was no expectation of novelty --- no one wrote about \\"Bleak House\\" that Dickens had failed to make a stylistic leap over \\"David Copperfield\\".<br /><br />Emmylou Harris is an Old School musician in many ways, but especially in this --- she's plowed the same field for almost all her career. There have been modest detours, but nothing requiring her to change her hair or buy a drum machine. She just sings American Roots music, straight ahead and unadorned.<br /><br />American Roots music isn't country, pop or rock, though it's not ashamed to borrow from those styles. It's not bluegrass, gospel, folk or Cajun, though there are elements. To its practitioners, it's the authentic heart of the heartland, songs that could only come from here, sounds that remind us who we are. Soul music, if you will.<br /><br />Emmylou Harris is the high priestess of this music, and on her 21st release she does it as well as anyone ever will. To those who do not worship at her shrine or listen only casually to her music, it may sound like just another Emmylou Harris record: that exquisite voice, evocative lyrics, flawless instrumentation and angelic harmonies. Yes, it is, and \\"Great Expectations\\" is just another Dickens novel.<br /><br />In today's lost and destructive music business, it takes ferocious courage and massive self-assurance to put out a record of quiet beauty and then to put a title like \\"All I Intended to Be\\" on it. That's a statement, a stake in the ground --- Emmylou Harris may seem uncommonly modest and self-effacing, but this is her \\"My Way\\".<br /><br />These songs were recorded over four years. The producer was Brian Ahern, her former husband and collaborator on her first 11 albums. The musicians may be well-known to music fans --- the singers include Dolly Parton, Vince Gill, Buddy Miller and the McGarrigle Sisters --- but there are an equal number of lesser-known singers and musicians who appear simply because they're dear to Emmylou. And the songs? \\"I've always seen myself as a relentless song-finder, a singer of other people's work whom I admire greatly, and an occasional songwriter,\\" she says, putting herself last and least, as is her custom.<br /><br />The songwriters are at once venerable and esoteric: Billy Joe Shaver, Merle Haggard, Patty Griffin, Mark Germino, Jack Wesley Routh. The song you probably know is by Tracy Chapman: \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul.\\" That could easily have been the title of this CD.

B000SFJWLU|1.0|I tried.  And I mean I really, REALLY tried.  I listen to every new disc I get at least ten or twelve times, all the way through, over the course of a month or more... just letting it sink in, digesting it in different environments and moods, forming an opinion of the overall and picking out highlights.    It's been three weeks and six times all the way through, and this is still one of the DUMBEST discs I have ever listened to.  Period.  Lyrics for the emotionally retarded and angst ridden poser/tough guys.  I couldn't even begin to tell you about the music because the pseudo tough guy wannabe hardcore vocals and the mind numbingly stupid and infantile lyrics just smack you in the face.  A limp wristed smack, at that.    Oh yeah... there was an (almost) ripping little solo in track seven (I think it was seven, anyway) that wasn't all that bad.    The stupidity of this album is offensive, and I don't recommend it to anyone who is (emotionally) over the age of nine.
0743424425|5.0|After reviewing a nice little Swiss thriller set in a Swiss mountain resort (Deal with the Devil), I thought I might visit the mother of all mountain resort horror stories, and pay a tribute to the king of popular literature. The man knows his craft. I have not read much by him, previously only Carrie, which is a small first novel, but a good basis for a strong movie, and Lisa's Story, at the time his latest publication, which I liked a lot, but which disappointed the fan club.<br />My main encounters with SK happen through the many movies made after his many stories. The Shining was one of the best of those movies, though it appears from SK's introduction to this 2001 reprint that he had some reservations about Kubrick's version. I ought to watch it again. I have a faint recollection that I found Jack Nicholson's acting overdone, long time ago.<br />The novel is a marvel of efficient storytelling. SK says it was his 'crossroad' novel. At that time, i.e. the early 70s, he decided to branch out from the pure horror approach and weave in a 'real' theme, which is the story of a troubled man and his struggles against his worldly demons: alcohol and violence. The hero Jack, best known with Nicholson's face, has a tendency to 'lose his temper'. In the process he loses his teaching job and his home and nearly loses his family. The road downhill leads up to a Colorado mountain, where he gets hired as a winter caretaker in a monster of a hotel, the Outlook. SK prepares us for all kinds of horrors: ghosts of dead hotel guests, a malfunctioning and possibly dangerous heating and plumbing system, the prospects of being snowed in for a long time, a predecessor who couldn't take it and killed his wife and daughters, a little son with supernatural abilities who can read his father's mind and can see the word 'suicide' there, which he does not understand ... Enough for today. Go and read it, if only in the interest of a balanced diet.
B000002KB8|5.0|Paranoid may be more even and have some of the best songs.  The Kinks may have one of the first \\"power chord\\" songs.  The MC5 and Blue Cheer may have been metal \\"forerunners\\" predating Sabbath.  Steppenwolf may have coined (or at least recorded) the phrase that describes it.  Deep Purple and Zeppelin may have been as musically heavy (at moments) at almost the same time (debatable, but I'll give it to you anyway...).  But, THIS IS THE FIRST.    The first heavy metal record by the first heavy metal band.  Know why?  All arguments and scholarly \\"but the Kinks..., but Blue Cheer..., but Zeppelin...\\" aside...    It's the DOOM.    Simple as that.  No other band, bluesy as they still were (and this album is very bluesy compared to following Sabbath offerings) were simply as gloomy and oppressive as Sabbath were.  This ain't no hippy B.S., this is the real stuff.    If you don't know this album and every note on it, you don't know metal.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I'm a huge muse fan and I was so excited about this CD/DVD set. The DVD alone is well worth the purchase! I don't know how they do it. The sound is amazing and the over show is mind-blowing. Particular favorites for me on the DVD would have to be Invincible, Buttlerflies and Hurrucanes, Blackout, Stockholm Sydrome, and Take a Bow. There are a few \\"jam\\" sessions between songs that are very cool! I would recommend this to ANYONE!!!!!!!! BUY IT!
B000002KHH|5.0|Every moment is PURE metal, losing most of the bluesy sounds from the first album...  and virtually every song is metal perfection.  It's one of the very, very, VERY few albums that I listen to all the way through every time.  In the car, I will detour a few blocks around, just to let \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" finish.  No, I'm not kidding.    Best listened to at antisocial levels of volume.  I can't wait to hear the remastering job on the Black Box set...
1423101464|5.0|I have been looking for a book that would spark my sons interest and make him want to read. I was lucky to find a series. We read the first book together and he was hooked.(So was I.) I found myself reading ahead of him and befor I knew it I had finished all four books. He doesn't know and I'm not going to tell him. I am actually excited to read it again with him. I find the character of Percy very likable and very human. I am amazed how quickly you became drawn to this boy, his friends and his dysfunctional family. Gods or not we all have someone in our families that we see in some of his. I am a new and loyal fan and I cant wait until the next chapter of this awsome saga  is released. If you are a parent of a child who thinks out of the box and needs a hero, you may just find one in Percy Jackson.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Well I read the book and it was amazing. But the film was very fast and very...moving from one thing to next and back again, it got very confusing for people who have not read the book. But The whole script and story deserves three stars. But I gave it five because i am a real fna of the tudor period. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson did a Fnatastic job portaring Anne and Mary Boleyn. But the story was not clear but still it was a great movie
B0014I4KIK|5.0|The first song I heard was \\"Mercy\\" and quite frankly I was not very impressed. Then I listened to \\"Rockferry\\" but still wasn't sure if I liked it.  I was walking by the new releases section and saw that it was on sale. Bought the CD, and after listening to it several times I've grown to love it - especially \\"Warwick Avenue\\".  I look forward to buying her next album - whenever it comes out.
0679735259|5.0|I just read this book for the first time since I was in college and it still is one of the best pieces of work on the hard job of covering a war from behind the lens of a camera. Herr always threw himself into the middle of things and had little patience for people who just went to VN to get their tickets punched. Incredible writing. Jaded but not cynical. Really called it as he saw it. As a former military and civilian reporter --but never in a war -- I can only marvel at how Herr kept doing his job day after day in the middle of so much terror and confusion.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|I have all Alanis' studio albums, from her mega selling debut, to \\"So-called chaos\\". My favourite though was her sophomore, the sprawling \\"Supposed former infatuation junkie\\", which found her exploring new musical ground.<br /><br />The adventure continues on her fifth CD. Produced by one time Madonna producer Guy Sigsworth, as expected there's more of an electro sound especially on songs like \\"Straightjacket\\" and the ambient sounding \\"Moratorium\\" (on which she declares a moratorium on things relationship/a respite from the toils of liaison).<br /><br />That's not to say she's abandoned her rock roots. She still rocks but with electronic flourishes, especially on songs like the uplifting \\"Incomplete\\", \\"Underneath\\", and the moody yet raging \\"Versions of violence\\". Opening cut \\"Citizen of the planet\\" has an Indian/Eastern feel (much like \\"Baba\\" from \\"Supposed former infatuation junkie\\"), with quiet verses and a raging chorus.<br /><br />Lightening things somewhat are the Poppy pair of \\"In praise of the vulnerable man\\", and the atmospheric \\"Giggling again for no reason\\".<br /><br />For ballads, we get the piano ballad \\"Torch\\", the absolutely gorgeous \\"Not as we\\" (another piano ballad with a light, yearning vocal delivery - a bit like \\"That I would be good\\" from \\"Supposed former infatuation junkie\\"), and my favourite song on the album, the swirling \\"Tapes\\". Lovely moody synths in the verses, and a rocky chorus with vocal gymnastics towards the end. Awesome!<br /><br />Every song is a standout really, and I think the pairing with Sigsworth was an inspired one. Having just come out of a high profile relationship/engagement, some lyrics are angry and cathartic, but that's Alanis, able to make angst sound great. My second favourite Alanis album.
B00125WAXC|5.0|Being both a college debater and someone who was active in the civil rights movement in the 60s I was looking forward to seeing this film about an earlier time (the 1930s) when debate was more popular but civil rights were much less real.  I believe the film succeeded both in its portrayal of debate (both its sport and its elegance) and its portrayal of the struggles for minority rights. It is true that the debates pictured were much shorter than most real debates, but still some of the concepts of argument and evidence, etc. came through.   I was especially  impressed that Denzel Washington sent his debater actors to a debate school which he created for them where they could get some understanding of how real debating works. I learned this and also about Washington's insistence on historically authentic music in some of the excellent special features on this \\"collector's edition.\\" I also was most impressed that Washington got  together with some of the individuals who had actually been involved at Wiley College in the debate season that brought them great national prominence. Some of his conversation with these individuals is included in \\"The Great Debaters: An Historical Perspective.  The movie had many outstanding actors and it provided many moments of excitement and also brought me to tears at times. It shows the tremendous courage of many almost unsung heroes of a time in our history which we need to remember.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|It arrived in a timely manner and its perfect. It worked wonderfully and I'd totally buy from them again.
0756404746|5.0|I picked up this book after reading Robin Hobb's review about it. And needless to say, I'm not disappointed at all. I loved the character, the story and the way it is told. The way it ends suggests that the next book is going to be even better than this one. I can't wait...

0385340567|1.0|Disappointing. After reeling off 11 good to (often) great Reacher novels, Lee Child struck out with this one. It starts promising enough. Despair had all the makings of a great stage for Reacher to be Reacher, reminiscent of the Killing Floor. But the promise is never fulfilled. The meandering plot doesn't pull you in. Unlike previous stories, the villain is flat, two dimensional and far from frightening - a death sentence for any story of good vs. evil. The action is sparse.     Previous Reacher novels were impossible to put down. You were torn between your desire to get to the end and your hope that the story would keep going. After all, it would be another year before you got the next one. Sadly, that was not true here. The ending seemed slapped on, left lots of loose ends untied and seemed very uncharacteristic for Reacher. But worst of all, it didn't come too soon. It could have come 100 pages sooner.     These were the big problems with the book. Reacher's detour into politics and criticism of the war did seem out of character but not because I had any assumptions about his politics. He always struck me as outside of politics - outside of almost everything for that matter.     Lee, everyone is entitled to a miss, especially after the roll you have been on. Here is hoping the next one is back to your old form
B00021HBGS|4.0|I was surprised how many pieces there were , the kids love it and it keeps them busy while they're getting clean!! Great price, quick shipping
0385340567|1.0|this book goes into the circular file... terrible plot, political diatribe   a total wate of my money
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This has to be on of the best shows on tv. I know there are great shows like lost, prison break, and heroes but this is just as good and might be even better.<br /><br />It's outrageous and very funny. The way that the show is placed and the writing of the script is incredible. Go Sam and Dean, LOL
0385340567|4.0|I love Jack Reacher. Many others do too. That is apparent when you read that ALL of the Jack Reacher books have been optioned to become motion pictures. That in itself is an amazing fact, that's for darn sure.<br />But...this latest offering of Lee Child isn't as taut as most of the Reacher books have been, and certainly not as exciting as the book before where Reacher and his old friends united and had a ball fighting together.<br />There is a short distance between Hope and Despair. Literally and figuratively. In this case, there are 2 towns side by side. Hope, a happy little town, and Despair, a dark sort of company town. Jack Reacher goes into Despair to have a cup of coffee and they don't serve him. Come on folks, give him a cup of Joe and let him go on his way!! But NO! They make trouble for Reacher, and when Reacher is pushed, he pushes back really hard.<br />He is taken out of Despair and into Hope, where Reacher finds an ally in Vaughn, a lady cop. The two start an uneasy friendship, then team together to see what the mystery Despair is hiding.<br />Personally, I don't like my reading pleasure have political and religious messages interspersed with my reading, and I have to say there is quite a bit on the Mid-East War, and of some radical forms of religion, and healthcare. Whether or not to agree or disagree, it just didn't feel as comfortable as the other stories have been and certainly more violent than previous books. I love this series and don't want a platform for Child's personal beliefs, however we may agree or disagree. Will I keep reading Jack Reacher books, you better believe it. But, I hope Child doesn't start using this series as a political platform.
006135323X|4.0|I picked this one up after hearing Dan Ariely interviewed on NPR. While it probably could have been about 1/3 as long without sacrificing anything (the writing seems really padded and needlessly verbose), each chapter has something to offer. I found the results of the author's experiments consistently interesting, and at least a few of them so struck me that I will modify my behavior and thinking as a result.<br /><br />Those who are criticizing Ariely's attempts to apply his findings to the larger world should lighten up. It's just one man's opinion. The results of the experiments, however, are irrefutable. This is well worth reading, even if you do some skimming here and there.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|This is an excellent new album by EmmyLou Harris.  My favorite track is \\"Kern River\\".  This is a beautiful but sad song about the loss of a close friend in Kern River which is located in Bakersfield California.  I also like the duet \\"Gold\\" with Dolly Parton.  Those two voices sound so good together. \\"Old Five and Dimers Like Me\\" is another good duet.  It features veteran country singer John Starling.  This song is about standing by a loved one.  The banjo playing by Kate McGarrigle is lovely here.  \\"Hold On\\" is about the ups and downs in the course of a person's life.  Vince Gill lends his talents singing back up vocals on this track.  Emmylou's voice sounds so serene on the \\"Shores of White Sand\\".  This is another one of my favorite tracks on this disc. \\"Sailing Around The Room\\" is a  pretty song about the cycle of life and death.  The acoustic guitar playing sounds so good on this track.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout with minimal equipment needed.  Well instructed and easy to follow in a circuit training style, it's easy to see that this DVD will give any one results. For someone who works out at a gym regularly this will be a great supplement or add on to my routine.  All you need is a set of hand weights and a mat, which makes it even more convenient.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Vintage 1972 Al Green.  Rhythm and blues, soul and jazz mixed to perfection.  Do what you have to do to see this man live.  Best show you will ever see.
0345495004|4.0|This was a terrific novel.  The dialog was witty and natural and the events, especially at the end, read like the plot of a best-selling thriller, except for the unfortunate outcome.  The moral dilemma inherent in the story is not down-played in the least, but in fact creates the dramatic tension in the book.  Horan is a first-class writer; I would not hesitate to buy her next work.
B000005JA8|5.0|I've read reviews of this -- long, wordy -- people trying to EXPLAIN this work of art. Well I'm sorry but that's just stupid. Just listen.
0312379293|5.0|I am not a person who normally writes a review. But, I want all of you to know a good book when you see one. All of you will definitely enjoy this one. There was not one boring page and not any places where the pace slowed down. The story was very cleverly written and I am a Jeffrey Archer fan from now on. This was the first of his books I have ever read and never have read one even similar to this one. Revenge is sweet when done in the right way. The ending was fabulous.     I just got another one of Archer's books and looking forward to it as well.
B001ATNPCK|5.0|If you are like me you fell in love with The Offspring in the early to mid 90's during \\"The Smash\\" era.  This album, while not as angry at the world, heavily punk inspired, 90's albums of theirs, is more like it than any of their past 3 albums.      The tracks blend together nicely, and the lyrics are definitely more inspired than anything they have recently done.  It seems that their recent hiatus has done them a lot of good.  There are far less \\"poppy\\" made for radio tracks than any of their recent albums as well.     The tracks aren't the happy and catchy radio stuff that people have grown accustomed to for the last 10 years, and for me, that is a great thing.  They seemed to have gone for more commercial success during that time, but it appears that they have gone back to what made them popular in the first place.      Overall, I have to say this is easily in their top 3 albums.  It may not be hardcore punk, but this is definitely the best album they have put out in the last decade.
0805079831|5.0|What a great in depth look at how our country really works it's foreign policy! Love the way Klein takes you from the very beginning of shock! A must read for anyone who considers themselves a patriot of the USA! Warning though! This book will force you to do something! It smacked me into following politics much more closely, calling my representatives, and getting much more involved.
0143038583|5.0|This is a wonderful book!  The science and philosophy and personal narrative blend together to make an extremely satisfying read.  I found The Omnivore's Dilemma to be one of those works which contemplate the question of what it means to be human, with a thought-provoking answer which touches many facets of our humanity.  The writing is conversational and easy to understand.  Five stars!
B0017I1FNK|3.0|As I listened to songs on the new ELH disc, adjectives like \\"dreamy\\" and \\"delicate\\" came to mind.  The tempos are nearly all so slow, it's a bit hard to remember that this is the same lady who once sang \\"Two More Bottles of Wine\\" and \\"Ain't Livin' Long Like This!\\"  The recording quality is excellent, the performances are also topnotch, but the CD is just missing a certain amount of umph.  I have nothing against Emmylou singing slow - \\"Too Far Gone\\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever - but her albums start sounding sleepy and even a little dreary without the occasional burst of energy.  Follow \\"Old Five and Dimers...\\" with \\"Kern River\\" and you have a recipe for excessive mildness.  (Then the very next tune, \\"Not Enough\\" is even slower!)  I guess if I could think of this as an album of funeral music, I might be giving it 4 or even 5 stars - it'd be great for background music as the body is lowered into the ground...  One other thing:  I've always liked the way Ms. Harris sings, but she does have a problem with slurring the lyrics, and her voice often drops off in the middle of a phrase.  I was grateful for the CD booklet, without which I would not have been able to understand what she was singing about on several of the songs.
B00005LC1H|5.0|There is nothing I've ever seen as funny as these 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers.  So funny and clever that you can watch them over and over and still laugh out loud rolling on the floor!  Can't recommend them highly enough.

0671024256|5.0|Back when I began reading books on writing by established writers, I did it out of a hankering to become a creative writer.   As the scales fell from my eyes and I realized that would only happen if I became the host body for a truly talented spirit, I found I still enjoyed reading writers on the theme of their craft.  I've read excellent books on the topic by Anne Lamott, John Gardner, Brenda Ueland, Eudora Welty and Rita Mae Brown, to name a few, but I have to say that Stephen King's just could be the best.    I have to confess to only ever getting through a short story or two of Mr. King's; I am not a horror or fantasy reader. I just can't do it.  That does not mean the man cannot write; in fact he is skilled and he does a knock up job of communicating what it takes to write.  At the outset, he will say that the actual creative kernel is born not grown but refining that talent and making the most of it is a matter of awareness, skill, knowledge and discipline, which can all be acquired.  He begins by demonstrating through his own life how he came to be the writer he is, snapshots that begin in early childhood.  He was obviously bright and his illustrations reveal someone ready to learn from experience, someone who put a no-nonsense work ethic behind the call of the muse.  The advice that constitutes the second part of the book is equally honest, without pretension.  He insists that a writer cannot write without building vocabulary and grammar skills.  He drives home the essential act of revision and above all, the necessity of a writer to read other works to stay fluent in the craft. A pool of trusted readers like his wife, Tabitha, help with perspective.    In 1999, halfway through writing this book, King was hit by a van.  He concludes the book with a postscript of how finishing it helped him recover.  As direct, plainspoken, honest, unpretentious and unsentimental as he comes across on the page, his story and advice add up to a compelling statement on the intersection of art and life.
0385340567|2.0|What starts out to be a good story ends up as a political rant against the war in Iraq, against the government, against the Pentagon, against the Veterans Administration and against the Army.  Imagine Jack Reacher actually encouraging Iraq war veterans to go AWOL and hide in Canada.  Not the Jack Reacher I have come to enjoy in Lee Child's previous books.  The story starts out strong with lots of mystery and a tough Jack Reacher overcoming lots of small town bullies but just kind of stops at the end with several unconnected subplots that don't make much sense.  Too bad.
B000000H42|5.0|Lyrics and singing style took me a while to get used to.  To this day, id still feel somewhat stupid playing this album in front of other people.  However, this album absolutely rules.  The guitar work is first rate.  I actually like King Diamonds voice, especially when he's not screaming in really high pitched tones.  I think this might be the most underrated metal album ever, or at least of the 80's.  Bands like Metallica and Megadeth were big fans of this group and you can see why.
B00151G08Y|5.0|This album is on the exact same level as Hold Your Own Colour (album).  I don't think that any single song out-does Hold Your Own Colour (song) but the album as a whole has much more energy.  Its not really hit or miss; each song had enough energy to prevent you from pushing \\"next\\" on your cd player.  I can't pick out a favourite yet but I must say that \\"Different\\" and \\"The Tempest\\" are very high up.  These songs tend to build up to a satisfying chorus or bridge.  \\"The Tempest\\" actually reminds me alot of Tool.  They've definitely moved a different direction than what many would've preferred.  Many of the songs have a very \\"pop\\" sound to them but they are no less enjoyable.  \\"9000 Miles\\" is another fantastic song but much more mellow than the rest of the album.  I agree with other reviews that hardcore D&B fans will likely hate this album given the stark contrast from the first album.
0143112589|4.0|This is the second Rumpole book I've read and I think I'm getting the hang of the author and his character.  It takes little exposure to become addicted.  The Rumpole books are nominally mysteries and very much witty satires.  They are the voice-driven \\"memoirs\\" of a man with one foot in the past (the time-honored conventions of the English legal profession, the British penchant for irony and wit, the taste for pub fare, etc.) and one foot in the present (9/11, 7/7, global warming, political correctness, etc.), a criminal defense lawyer with a colorful clientele who are all hopeless cases, especially given the biases of pompous prosecutors and judges they're up against.  The mystery or suspense lies in how Rumpole prevails, which he does when it comes to making sense of the law and bad behavior; he does not prevail in matters involving politick sensitivity with colleagues or his wife, Hilda, aka She Who Must Be Obeyed.     This time out, Rumpole is defending a Pakistani national who has been detained as a terrorist without rights even though he is a respectable doctor who has practiced his entire career in London and has an English family.  The Blair government seems as keen on packing up constitutional rights once and for all as is this side of the pond.  Meanwhile, offering comic relief, Hilda's own memoirs are interspersed with Rumpole's.  Lots of wit and satire zing the political and pompous without sacrificing due respect for the gravity of the issues.
B0012QE4QC|5.0|i watched this movie twice this weekend and will definately purchase the dvd. its history, plot, characters and props were beautifully done by the directors. the details in the filming were wonderful....the costumes of the characters were incredibly beautiful, the castle and noble homes very true to their times.most of all, i enjoyed the believability of the characters and their walk through their lives.the plot has several turns for these boleyn sisters that change the course of englands history.this will be one of my favorite movies of the year.i did not read the book first, so i apologise for my upbeat outlook to the literary world out there.........i stick to my title line,\\"I LOVED IT!\\"
B000002LK1|5.0|Im not an expert on this genre or this band, but this is a great album.  classic.
B00005MK9Y|2.0|I am a huge Bob Marley and old school reggae fan. However, I did not like this cd because it is too fast-paced. Don't get me wrong, I like faster songs, when it is hip hop or something. But when it is Reggae, no...  I have most of these songs on other cds, and love them. But this version just sounds like they are racing through their usual material instead of that slow, \\"yeah mon, it's all good\\" kind of vibe.  I can't even believe I am not giving a 5 star review to anything he created,understand that.

B000002KBU|4.0|I recently viewed the American Masters documentary on Joni Mitchell during a time when I had been re-reading Norman Mailer's Marilyn- his take on the life of the legendary screen star Marilyn Monroe. And although there is no obvious connection between the lives or the talents of the two women there is a tale of two generations hidden here. Marilyn represented for my parent's generation, the generation that survived the Great Depression and fought World War II, the epitome of blond glamour, sex and talent. To my more `sedate' generation blond-haired Joni represented the introspective, searching, quiet beauty that we sought to represent our longings for understanding in a seemingly baffling world that we had not made. As this documentary and Mailer's book point out however they `represented' our fantasies they also shared a common vulnerability- attempting to be independent women in worlds dominated by men. Such is the life of the great creative talents.    Now to the work- this album of work only brings out the truth of what I tried to express above. In such songs as her homage to her place of birth Canada (and to her adopted home California), the songs of trials and tribulation of dealing with fame, men (in and out of love, think about My Old Man and The Last Time I Saw Richard) and the expressions of her political beliefs (as she rides on th eplane to somewhere) she sings her heart out, so, so sweetly we forget how powerful a voice she has. No barrelhouse singer here and for the material presented none is necessary. That is the true virtue of her value as a singer/songwriter. Blue is just a notch below Ladies of the Canyon in the pantheon of her best music but that just places it in very nice company. Sing on.
B0000931QA|5.0|One of the best album of the 80's, period.  Every track is great.  I guess it is a little cheesy, but I don't care.  I LOVE this album!
0765348276|5.0|I enjoyed the characters, the sense of teamwork, the introduction to new (to me) science fiction concepts, a new universe with continually new aliens and the happy ending.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno was one of the most buzzed about movies in 2007.  I loved it in the theatre and I loved it on DVD--hey to be honest, even my husband enjoyed it on DVD.  The writing in the movie is sharp, the dialog is crisp and funny even though we all know high schoolers don't really talk like that.  And although the story takes a look at a fairly regular topic in recent American films, unplanned pregnancy, its take is fresh with an empowered young woman at its center.<br /><br />All that being said, Juno is a fairy tale.  No young woman really comes out of a pregnancy that unscathed and able to pick up her previous life.  But its an enjoyable fairy tale to watch.  The cast are all great, but the women in particular--Ellen Page, Jennifer Garner, and Allison Janney--give this movie its zest.  You won't be disappointed if you rent this film.

B000005DQR|5.0|I just heard this album for the first time about a week ago.  I came away very impressed.  Not the typical type of music I listen to, but this takes some serious skill.  Building Steam with a Grain of Salt is sick.
0307455378|4.0|Errr... book binding is something quite different from cover art! The binding on this book (binding being how the book is manufactured; how it is sewn and glued) really is terrible. I had to trawl through 15 copies in my bookshop to find a book with binding that was not torn.
1400049628|3.0|Actually this is not really much of a scary book, and as others have said, and even the book says, is more humor based. It is a fun little read, with some great tongue-in-cheek passages. It starts out very strong, but lags in the middle. The end has some great stuff though.<br /><br />I think somebody else mentioned it best as the type of book to thumb through here and there when you have time to kill. For zombie enthusiasts this is easily a 4 or even 5 star book, for everyone else, it is certainly worth a look or two, and is very original in its style. Check it out, I think most of you will be pleasantly surprised.
B0016A2FFG|3.0|I love Al Green. Been a fan since Back Up Train. But this? I'm not feeling it. Sure they brought the Al Green sound in, but somebody forgot the lyrics. These songs are not really saying anything. The best, latest Al Green, for me, has been the disc I Can't Stop.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I was first exposed to Cloverfield at the theater previews, where my first reaction was, \\"Looks like a Blair Witch rip-off where people run around scared for two hours screaming with a hand held camera, only to be disappointed when the monster is not even revealed or shown.\\" Because of my mistaken first impression, and because I didn't want to throw up, I refused to see the movie at the theatres and wanted to hate it. So when I finally did see it on pay per view, I was expecting a retarded movie. But I was pleasently suprised. The first hour of suspensful buildup never became boring (to me anyways), and when the creature was finally revealed, it was intenese and well worth the wait. The huge creature destroying New York was shown enough to be interesting , but not overdone to where it lost it's intensity or power. During the beginning I was thinking if I saw the movie in the theaters, I'd hate the motion of the camera, but by the end of the movie, I was thinking it may have been worth throwing up just to see the monster's destruction and massiveness on a larger then life big screen.<br />Earlier, I compared it to Blair Witch Project, which I despised. But who knows, if Blair Witch had a budget and effects and well designed creatures like Cloverfield, it may have had an enjoyable climax like Cloverfield. This critic will buy the DVD.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Wots to review? Its the BEATLES!! I'm a long time fan. VHS too worn out.
B00168ML1G|5.0|I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.<br /><br />The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.<br /><br />The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.<br /><br />The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.<br /><br />Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.<br /><br />Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.<br /><br />Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.<br /><br />Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. This will certainly be a movie I pick up when it comes out on Blu-Ray later this year. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!amazing for the short time he was on screen.

0812976525|5.0|`Thank You for Smoking' by Christopher Buckley<br /><br />Christopher Buckley once again delivers with his supremely sharp jabs at American political correctness and smug political sanctimony.  Buckley's hero, Nick Naylor, top spokesman for the tobacco industry keeps you in hysterics as he flaks for his industry during appearances with the likes of Larry King.  The unfailingly intelligent banter served up at Naylor's weekly lunch club with his fellow MoD's (Merchants of Death - reps of the firearm & alcohol industries) will bust your gut.  Mr. Buckley's knack for sublimely over the top humor will undoubtedly keep you in stitches and wanting for more.  The story contains enough twists and turns, wild characters and silky wit to keep you reading his novels forever.  For any lover of smart satire, definitely check out this terrific novel.  As with any great book turned movie, celluloid inevitably finds a way to disappoint and `Thank You For Smoking' is certainly NOT an exception.  If you've seen the movie and think you've got the story - trust me - you haven't.  The book is a near entirely different plot and far smarter offering of fun - check it out!
0688172377|3.0|This is the autobiography of Waris Dirie, an international supermodel. Waris grew up as part of a nomadic tribe in Somalia that still practices female circumcision, sleeps outdoors, subsists on camels milk, and marries off young girls at 12 or 13 to much older men. It was very interesting to read about her experiences as a child because her upbringing was the same as the upbringing of children 1000 years ago in Somalia. Waris' description of her circumcision and the problems she experienced afterward were poignant and terrifying.<br /><br />Waris clearly has a good sense of humor. It is interesting to read her perspectives first of Mogadishu and then of London. It is fascinating to hear about how she became a model. Unfortunately, the book degenerated in the second half. Waris becomes conceited and less likeable. She also seems a bit selfish in her behaviors towards her friends.<br /><br />This book was a good read because of the first half but the last hundred pages was a big disappointment.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I am on my second Swivel Sweeper, not cuz my first one broke but because my son left it behind when we moved- I couldn't wait to get another one. This sweeper has worked superbly for me in a large apartment with 4 cats, teen boys, carpet, wood and tile floors. It is very maneuverable, surprising strong for its light weight and size, and my two have been very durable- I am very surprised at reviewers who have had problems with this, I highly recommend it- I actually use it as my primary vacuum and it is very user-friendly since I walk with a cane and have rotator cuff problems, this little gem makes things a lot easier for me.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|It's immediately familiar for anyone who has followed her work over the years, but refreshed with intoxicating new hooks, loops, and verses. I love it.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|Great modern pop offering with a spiritual feel. Personal and unpretentious.  Hints of Talking Heads, Kingston Trio, and the latest Euro power pop bands.  Not just one or two good singles, but an overall great album that is consistently uplifting and entertaining throughout.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I simply loved this film.  It's beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted and engrossing.  This war is not easy to watch, the things that occured are difficult for any of us to fathom, but stories like this really illustrate that humans are not only capable of horrible things, but incredible things.  There is a balance between beauty and ugliness in this film that is reminiscent of Shindler's List.  I really feel that this film is Brody's finest work to date.  This is a personal story and it feels that way, its triumphant and I enjoy triumph occuring in the eyes of a storm, it leaves us with hope.
B00005JMJG|1.0|And you can guess this isn't one of them.<br /><br />You know what this movie's about?  \\"Wouldn't it be cool if we could erase our memories?  Wouldn't that be cool?\\"  No.  Characters, plot, actors with a lick of talent, and dialogue that doesn't just lay there would be cool.  So would some good writing, which is notable for its total absence here.<br /><br />I did watch it all, by the way.  The girl's recording of why she was dumping Jim Carrey was good writing.  Nothing else was.<br /><br />When Jim Carrey was running around in his old memories with the metaphor for his memories of what's-her-face, did anyone have a TRON flashback?<br /><br />Really, we take one little premise and waffle and wander all over the place for over 100 minutes that seem a whole lot longer than that.<br /><br />And really, if we had mind-wiping technology, is that what we'd do with it?  Settle a spat with a guy/girl or forget a dead doggie?  If my cat left me for some other guy with a tin of tuna, I'd certainly want to remember her.<br /><br />But all that's irrelevant.  Really it's just bad, lazy, sloppy writing.
B00000AFWW|3.0|This is a pop-polished version of \\"Live Through This\\".  It doesn't have the strength or the grit.  The songs are decent, you can enjoy them in all of their pop glory, but this CD doesn't have the solid realism of its predecessor.
B0014XCMVM|1.0|Please come back old Alanis. This ALBUM is awful and impossible to go through. If you love your money don't buy it. Canadian singers that copy the American singers sound awful. Where are the Canadian culture and music? They don't have their own music? They own culture? My POINT: ALANIS SOUNDS AWFUL and her lyrics are kind of bad too (she screams too much). Save your money or buy Bring Ya to the Brink CYNDI LAUPER, because will make your summer FUN and better!!!!
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  Henson's masterpiece.  It's inventive, its interesting, engaging and the world is quite wonderful.  There are lessons learned and many parallels between the world Henson created and our own.  It's a wonderful fantasty film that really breathes a life all its own.  It's also a film that can be enjoyed by all, adults and children.
1592802974|4.0|I am kind of critical to these books.  Probably half of the interviews are worthwhile to read.  Some trading styles are enlightening.  Last chapter is full of BS though.  All in all, a good read!
B000R4SMCW|3.0|This movie is enjoyable and while it won't have you guessing until the last (its easy enough to figure out) it is well acted and enjoyable all the same.  The only thing that bothered me was Hopkins character had many many plans thought out to the last detail and I wondered how then, he could forget the obvious (I wont give detail to spoil it) but the answer is simple isn't it:  This IS Hollywood.
0316067598|4.0|The story is excellent. Great narration, great detail about BUD/S and the Navy Indoc program. I felt like I was there with Luttrel. The narrative about Operation Redwing is very detailed and also subtlety tugs at the heart strings during the engagement when he loses his three team mates. Patrick Robinson's influence is also present, and I think this helps Luttrel in focusing his narrative.     Luttrel obviously has a well earned axe to grind against what he perceives American Policy and the media. However he also broadly condemns the media and Liberal, (I am interpreting this as Democrats) politicians in the United States Justice system's application of the rules of engagement. The rules of engagement cost him his friends and a part of his life. For that there is no compensation large enough. However by broadly condemning what he calls the \\"liberals\\" I think he is doing the narrative a disservice. I think it would have been better to leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions about what might be wrong with the rules of engagement, our society, our approach to engaging in military conflict. I would have hoped that Patrick Robinson would have helped with this as an experienced writer and journalist. But perhaps Robinson has his own axe to grind as well.     I am not drawing judgement on Luttrel. His service and sacrifice are beyond anything anyone could have asked of one person. I just think that a narrative the draws conclusions for the reader is more of a personal vendetta than an exploration into the story that allows the reader to draw their own conclusion.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This show is a \\"Must buy\\", whether you like Madonna or not.  One of a kind show in terms of Sound, Video art and performance.  Good price for 2.5 hours DVD DTS plus audio disk.  Down side - Only DTS, no DD
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Or better yet, smash the director's face.  This movie was painful.  Natatlie Portman was awful, the characters flat and lifeless, and even the movie's title makes me want to drift off to sleep.  There is no reason to see this movie.  Avoid it like a sledgehammer to the shins.
B00007J4SI|4.0|The sound is not really so bad as some reviews claim, but the real purpose of my \\"review\\" is to alert you that (as several of the reviews mention in passing) this so-called \\"complete\\" set omits 13 pieces that spill over to Ponti's 2-CD set of the sonatas.  It should really be labelled \\"Piano Music Vol. 1\\" and the 2-CD set \\"Piano Music Vol. 2, including the Sonatas.\\"  This is an important consideration if you're intending to supplement another pianist's version of the sonatas (such as Hamelin's excellent set on Hyperion) with the other works.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Not much here. The whole album is very repititous. All in all it's standard, and not much more.    I wouldn't mind the standard chords and rather bland instrumentation if the lyrics were there to back it, but they aren't. As another reviewer said, there's nothing here that's new or innovative. That said it's not horrendous, but also not particularly enjoyable.
1595141715|4.0|I'll keep this short, since there are other reviews that do the sum-up thing very nicely.<br /><br />This is an extremely insightful, well-written, and heart-wrenching book, which I'd highly recommend.  I'd take away maybe half a star at most because the complete absolution of the viewpoint character -- the only boy who remains utterly blameless -- seems like a cop-out to me, as if he's on the list just to be the innocent one, so that the reader, looking through his eyes, can feel \\"innocent\\" as well, can feel some distance from the subject matter. It detracts from the lesson a little bit, for me.  (Just a little.)  But the emotions explored and the situations presented feel very true and real nonetheless.<br /><br />Yes, some of the situations might be \\"R-rated,\\" sometimes terrifyingly so, but really, 1) if they were not, do you think this girl would have felt the need to commit suicide? and 2) do we really think kids are not already going through this stuff every day?<br /><br />(I especially admire that the author makes his readers aware of the nature of predators, using the character who collects sexual \\"conquests\\" like trophies, who dehumanizes his victims.  Young ladies, if you find yourself with a  young man who makes you feel as if you are not there, as if you are somehow less of a person than he is, listen to your gut feelings and get the heck out.  Actually, young men, get the heck out too -- it's not only girls who get victimized.)<br /><br />An incredible read.
0385333846|2.0|June 9, 2008    Criticism on Slaughterhouse 5     Slaughterhouse 5, by Kurt Vonnegut, describes the unpredictability of life, as well as the inability to control it.  The main character of the book, Billy Pilgrim, goes on many different adventures, some at home, and some on other planets several quadrillions of miles away from earth.  Many lessons are taught in the book, some which certain people may disagree with.  Among these are ideas that cannot be controlled, and the future cannot be altered by your decisions.  Another suggestion is that death is not a large thing to worry about, as one can remember the good parts of someone's life, not just how they are now.  However, these lessons have the potential to be disregarded by people who believe otherwise, if they are not already.     An interesting aspect of the book is that it is written in a format similar to the described Tralfamadorian format in the book.  Several small passages make up the majority of the book, which alludes to the way the inhabitants of planet Tralfamadore format their books.  Their books are meant to contain many short, happy memories that can all be viewed at once to form a single image of contentment.  However, not all of the scenes in this book may be viewed as joyful.  Plenty morose sections counter the good in this book.     The repetition of \\"so it goes\\" (1) in this book is unique and confusing.  Usually it follows a mention of death, therefore following the main theme of life being uncontrollable, but is absent at certain instances, such as the death of Russians.  This may be because the author doesn't like this group of people for some reason, or it may just be one of the many cases of disrespect in this book.     This novel has many inappropriate aspects as well.  Wikipedia commented that \\"Because of its realistic and frequent depiction of swearing by American soldiers, its irreverent language (including the sentence `The gun made a ripping sound like the opening of the zipper on the fly of God Almighty,') and some sexually explicit content, Slaughterhouse-Five is among the most frequently banned works in American literature, and in some cases is still removed from school libraries and curricula.\\" (2)  This is true, as many swear words were often repeated, and coupled with pornographic content at the end of chapter nine, this book may not be recommended to some audiences.  Not to mention the fact that the repetition of this content distracts from the meaning found in this novel.  However, any alterations to create a censored book would drastically alter the plot, so unfortunately it is hard to avoid this content if one wishes to read the novel.     In conclusion, Slaughterhouse 5 is a unique book with many hidden details that this criticism just touched the surface of, though it may not be recommended to some audiences.  Vonnegut has created another novel that matches his style exactly.    (1) Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut  (2) Wikipedia Search \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\"
B0015FHDRW|2.0|Not a bad effort, but much too close to sounding exactly like the Stooges.    Buy \\"Funhouse\\" or The Stooges first album. And you'll hear the original Foxboro Hot tubs.    Surely these guys can put something together a bit more original.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|This is different from what they used to do, but I would think so considering it's been ten years since their last cd. They have evolved and changed their sound creating an equally good cd as their prior two. I really like it. Couldn't give it five stars though. That takes something remarkable.
1402210795|5.0|As an avid regency era reader, i have read most of georgette heyers books, but this one (and Cotillion) is by far my favorite. It has many unexpected twists and turns, and not just another copy cat plot. Most of the romance stories I read have a predictable plot they meet each other and after a few minor set-backs agree they are the only two people for each other. Fridays Child is on a whole other level. Upon being rejected in love Lord Sherringham marries the first lady he meets on a whim, his young country bride ends up getting in hysterical scrapes that he has to get her out of. But does he really love her, when he married her to spite another?

0553062182|3.0|I bought this book with the recommendation/ suggestion from a friend.  Based on the info from Amazon, I thought it might be a helpful read.  But after obtaining the book, I discovered it doesn't really describe me as much as we guessed.  I'm taking that as good news (no sense taking on another label).  The author does a really nice job of reassuring readers that being an HSP is ok.  Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of and that success and happiness are still within reach.  So a very nice, concrete, positive book.  Lots of practical exercises and things to ponder, but if you aren't really a \\"highly sensitive person\\", it falls rather flat.
0757302661|5.0|Awesome book!  Although I only made it to an 8 using this I am taking classes and WILL have a Hypnobirth next time.  This method saved me from the extremely painful contractions that started at 32w6d and continued through bedrest and up until my son was born at 39w1d.  After learning the tecniques the pain was magically gone and so was the fear!
B0011BGY66|4.0|I've given this CD a few listens, and I've begun to appreciate it even more with each listen:  each of the songs fit well with the rest of the CD, and while there are definitely some particularly strong songs on the album (\\"Mansard Roof\\", \\"A-Punk\\" and the hook in \\"One (Blake's Got A New Face)\\" all come to mind) there aren't any songs that I'd say \\"...eh\\" to.    It definitely has an Afro/Caribbean feel to it, which adds to its divergence from standard alternative fare.  The influence of the likes of the Talking Heads and Peter Gabriel can be heard in it as well.  Overall a strong debut.

1400044162|5.0|To have a young woman write so seamlessly about a war that began and ended long before she was even born is impressive.  What's most impressive is the thoroughness and precision. There are so many stories yet it's easy to follow.  It paints an accurate picture of what it was like to live through the Biafran war and really, the struggles of living through any war.  The painful part is knowing that the West learned little from this human tragedy.  The West's perceptions of Igbo people and of Africans people ring true even today unfortunately.      To quote Odenigbo, \\"voice of our generation!\\"  As I began, it was tempting to label her our generation's Chinua Achebe but such a comparison would rob both of their respect that they've both earned.
B00006GEXQ|5.0|the dvd is in very good condition the sender was on time sending my order.I would recommend the seller to everybody.
0312379293|5.0|For all you Dumas fans...especially the Count of Monte Cristo.....read Standing at the Scratch Line by Guy Johnson.
0786891084|5.0|The most adorable story!!! The book is a quick read, and it's so good you're sad when it ends....it's a great, typical Cecelia Ahern book..if you liked \\"P.S. I LOVE YOU\\" you will LOVE this one!
0062515675|2.0|I appreciate the underlying wisdom 'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari' tries to articulate - develop joyful thoughts, follow our life's mission & calling, cultivate self-discipline, nourish relationship etc. On the other hand, I am disappointed by Sharma's inferior writing; the dialogue between a high profile trial lawyer & his protoge seems unrealistic & superficial, & the characters are difficult for readers to relate to.<br />For readers who are interested in learning more about the wisdom that 'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari' fails to articulate, I would recommend Alan Wallace's 'Genuine Happiness', and Matthieu Ricard's 'The Quantum & The Lotus'.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth looks incredibly sharp, poignant, and breathtaking on my 1080p LCD. Colors are bright and wonderful. Whether its a shot from really high up (low flying satellites maybe) where you can see a river flow through half a continent or close-ups of amazing animal habitats, you will be overwhelmed by the quality of the film. Planet Earth really showcases everything 1080p is all about. It's worth the money too because you get 4 discs for a total of 9.5 hours.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I have had this workout since before DVD's, and its the best.  I've bought others and this is still the best.  Works the entire body; first a warm up, then cardio (legs), then series of abs, chest, arm and back exercises; all you need are a set of free weights. Plus you can grow with it; Cindy gives you encouragement by saying if you can't keep up at first, its ok, do what you can, and eventually you'll get stronger.  What I think I like the best is its just you and Cindy (well, the trainer guy pop's his head in every once in a while).  There are not a bunch of overly happy women showing different moves on one screen.  It really is focused on exercise, not looks.  Which might sound weird since its Cindy Crawford, but its true!  Plus!  there is a glossary at the end that goes over the moves that you could potentially hurt yourself, and goes over the correct way of performing the moves.  What exercise DVD out there has that???
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I work for a bookstore and when I saw the novel The Other Boleyn Girl by Phillipa Gregory, I was very intrigued. I bought and read it in about a week and absolutely fell in love with it. I especially loved it because I am a fan of the show the Tudors and am a history buff. When I found out the book was going to be a movie with Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johannsen I was very excited and expected it to be really good. Boy, was I wrong.    The movie was terribly disappointing. Here's why:      The book is about Mary Boleyn and her experiences through the years that included her liason with the king and her sister Anne's. Mary is the other Boleyn girl. The book is about her experiences, her feelings, and her loves. Whoever wrote the movie made the entire story about Anne! And Mary was once again tossed in the background. I absolutely hate it when movies based on novels aren't true to the author's work, and The Other Boleyn Girl is no different. If I wanted to watch a story about Anne Boleyn, I would watch The Tudors, which is more accurate. This is supposed to be Mary's time to shine. And although Eric Bana is hot, he made a terrible Henry VIII.  Spoiler ** Henry rapes Anne in the movie when he becomes tired of her games. NOT IN THE BOOK AND NEVER HAPPENED!!!! Henry was obsessed with Anne, yes, but he never went that far.    Whoever wrote this movie needs to learn to treat books with more respect and be more true to the novel.   The visuals are nothing without a good plot and dialogue to fall back on.
0609610570|5.0|This book does a great job of helping a leader see the importance of staying disciplined enough to stay in the game, particularly with his or her people.  I recommend this book for all organizational leaders - regardless of the position on the ladder.
0385340567|3.0|I was disappointed in this latest installment of the Reacher chronicles. I never felt the urgency, thrills, and mystery that hallmarks other Reacher reads. No real life/death situations for Reacher or anyone else in this novel that made page turning a must. Even Reachers love interest and eventual coupling was pretty uneventful. And no delicate twists from out of the blue that ties everything together like previous stories.
