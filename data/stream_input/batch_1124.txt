B004SBS8LA|4.0|The graphics are more impressive. The game play is more smooth.  A challenging game on multiple levels: play to release the birds, play for high score, play to get the extras (pineapples, bananas).
B004SBS8LA|1.0|every time I try to download the &quot;free app&quot; it asks me for payment information.  does anyone know how to get around this?  why did they go through amazon and not just the normal market?

0061733199|4.0|Having served in the US Army, I've had their version of survival training for real, which is decent but certainly not up to the standard of the US Air Force or any of the special forces. Since leaving the army I've continually added to my knowledge through books and other media, and so I didn't see this book as a holy grail of survival or anything when I ordered it, just another book.    That being said, this book is actually excellent. If I could choose only one book from the rather large library I've developed on the topic it would be this one. It's not perfect, the knots section for example will probably be difficult to follow for the complete novice, but it is certainly the most complete of any of the books I own.    I took one star away because our otherwise knowledgeable author, Mr. Wiseman, has added consistent spelling and grammatical errors throughout the book. They really don't affect the utility of the book or the readability of it's contents at all, but for a stickler like me they are rather annoying, especially with this being a \\"revised\\" edition.    Overall an excellent choice no matter what you're looking to learn.
0307271862|1.0|I also bought this book in an airport bookstore based on the cover synopsis and reading the first paragraph.  The plot and the writing starts out very well and the book hooks you.  And then the let down starts setting in.  The unbelievable coincidences, plot twists, and the mind numbing political lecturing.  I finished the book because I hoped that it would come back around.  It didn't.  The ending was absolutely a complete unrealistic farce.    Don't waste your time on this book - there are too many good books out there to read, some even by this author.
B0043EV774|5.0|For a person Who Isn't much of an Alice fan, THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT, the acting, the scenes, and the story-line follows the book much better. I reccomend this movie for ALL ages (especially on blue-ray)!

0061801313|3.0|I made the mistake of watching the show first and liked it better (just my preference). The book seemed too wild for a teenage book. Teens already face enough peer pressure and morality struggles, I just liked that the show lessoned it slightly. :) GREAT WRITING, and AMAZING STORY though.
0756404738|5.0|If you enjoyed The Name of the Wind then you will love Wise Man's Fear. What stands out the most to me is how sad I was to finish the book. Waiting is really going to be tough but I'm sure it will be worth it to see where Rothfuss takes us next.
0812550706|5.0|Being a young woman, I'm usually turned-off by talk of space, and any sort of violence, or sports-like talk. This book has changed my ENTIRE perspective on how I purchase literature now! It is one of the most fantastic books of all times. I would reccomend this to man, woman, young or old. I am so thrilled I gave it a chance, and can't imagine anyone NOT enjoying Ender.
0553386794|1.0|I agree with all of the reviewers who only gave this one star. It's a boring, ridiculous soap opera devoid of any sliver of happiness or hope. I am so sick of reading about someone getting raped IN EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER!!!! Makes me think the author is a seriously dirty old man.<br /><br />Someone gave this book to me as a Christmas gift and I was excited to read it. When I had finished it, I came to Amazon to see if the reviews were terrible because I hated it so much. I don't know why so many people gave it a good rating.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Most family movie nights involve the same animated movie with the SAME plot and SAME ending. I thought the story line was CREATIVE and NEW for once. Great twist, and great casting. This is a movie that you could watch at ANY age.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Thank god for Amazon and their daily app deals. I was gettng slightly upset at soundhounds inability to recognize remixes and obscure music. Shazam encore to the rescue. The user interface is dull but it does its job much better.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I really liked Alone... Kept you thinking \\"whodunnit???\\"  One minute my mind was thinking... yep! The next minute... nope!  Twists and turns I didn't see coming... that's for sure... Definitely recommend this one.  I will be reading the rest in this series... I just love Bobby Dodge!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|firstly, for everyone who was rating one star for being free on android market, it wasn't even on there.<br /><br />second, the game itself looks great and is very fun. but wasn't challenging at all. 3 starred all but one level and didn't have to invest a lot of time to do so.  but it killed a little time and is pretty fun. looking forward to some new levels soon!
B004SKHJF2|4.0|I can't complain.  This applies works fine. No installation issues using the Amazon application store. Not useful enough to pay $5 but great for free.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I have 62mb free on my phone, and it's telling me to free up space. Surely I have more then enough space?? Will give more stars when I can play what I paid for.
0823023494|4.0|If you're looking for something to help you create cartoon characters, this is a great reference. It's fun to see this writer's style and how he develops characters.   I wouldn't use it to completely alter and develop my style, I don't think the book was made for that, but for a little bit of inspiration it did help.  For what it was worth, I liked it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I managed to avoid/miss the whole Angry Birds phenomenon until Amazon offered this as a free app.  I figured I might as well at least download it and give it a try for free.  The game is actually incredibly fun and addictive as you attempt to release the birds using a combination of physics considerations and the special abilities of the birds.  I can even see some replayability since I can go back and play levels to get more stars or better scores.  I was pleasantly surprised and will probably check out more Angry Birds titles (or at least the expansions to this one).
B004SKHJF2|4.0|I cant believe this app is free today. I like this much better than soundhound &amp; I love that u can go directly into pandora &amp; play that station
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love rio a lot! it is so much fun, and a lot easier than regular angry birds. you should get it right away! yeahhhhhh
B004SKHJF2|4.0|this is normally $5 how can u complain. I know soundhound is free but shazaam was the original and I only learned of soundhound once shazaam got greedy and began to charge. If Amazon keeps this up they will be a major app store for android apps vs the market! great work Amazon!
B003ZK58WM|4.0|I have read both the Pillers of the Earth books and found them extremely interesting. This bookwas just as much a page turner although I will agree with other reviewers and admit it is forced. The book is great at showing the history of the war...I learned much I didnt know. However..in reality the fiction story is completely impractical...too many characters privy to too many events. But I looked past that and enjoyed the great story and history behind it.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|This album is just \\"ok\\"...the songs that are on the radio are the only ones really worth listening to on this album.  not very many tracks, either. shoulda just downloaded the few songs i liked off itunes!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|What a great application! Works great on my EVO 4g and because I listen to music all the time this will come in extremely handy. Thanks amazon for the unlimited version for free.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Shazam gets all of the mainstream music and even some stuff that's not very well known. It works fairly quick. I'd recommend this or Soundhound.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Best version yet. So much fun! The graphics are so good. Game play is great. Music is fun to listen to. Highly recommended.  Get it now! You won't be sorry.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better than the original angry birds.  Graphics another and more vibrant.  Runs better on my samsung vibrant than the original too!  Highly recommended time sink.
1591843790|2.0|I agree with two-star reviews here. Yes, Enchantment contains some useful content but it's hard for me to believe that this is one of Guy's best books. Disclaimer: I received a free media copy. Much of the critical reviews point out similarities with Carnegie's &#34;How to Win Friends and Influence People.&#34; I'd agree with those assessments and also think that much of the book relies upon sheer common sense.<br /><br />It's also very broad but not very deep. I feel like this book could have been much better if it had gone deeper in fewer areas, rather than trying to cover employees, customers, and so many other areas.<br /><br />Of course, there are those who could use reminders of firm handshakes, eye-contact, and the like. I guess that I'm just not one of them.<br /><br />This isn't a bad book but, if I'm honest, Guy wouldn't be Guy today if this was his first.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|after playing the originals then coming to rio all i could say is wow! and staying signed into the amazon app store is the same as staying signed into gmail to use the android app store...
B004GYY714|5.0|wayyyyy better than ESPN's own radio app, as well as all local am/cm stations, greatest app ever, saved my life use it for ESPN radio everyday. I live in SF and use it for NY stations. A++  HTC EVO

B004I2K4DY|3.0|As an avid Les Mis fan I was stunned when I saw that they cast Nick Jonas (Yes, a Jonas Brother)in the part of Marius, I feel bad for him, he seemed to try so hard but his voice was lost amongst all those trained Broadway voices. If you ever watch the 10th anniversary Les Mis and hear Michael Ball as Marius you will know what I mean. What a shame because the rest of the cast was awesome.
B003PSGPHG|5.0|Don't let the first few pages put you off with their jagged syntax. This book says more about selfless love than any theological work I've ever read. Yet it's not preachy or intrusive. It's a panoply of failures that succeed in the end and miseries that make us see our own troubles as trivial and ourselves as fortunate. This is not a book for those who live by complaining about their lives.    It's also an unusual novel for its narrative point-of-view. And it's not just a matter of the narrator's being death; it's that death turns out to dislike its job and is so caring in its own way. Also, the narrator is intrusive (but effectively so). A fine novel that doesn't let go of you easily.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Not sure about this. But I can't possibly give a good review to an app that never lets you get past the opening screen! What the hell?
0891419063|5.0|To understand, really understand, what war is about, listen to William Tecumseh Sherman, the great Civil War general, and E.B. Sledge, a real life marine in the Pacific Theater of WWII.<br /><br />Sherman said, \\"War Is Hell\\" and Sledge describes that hell in suprising, intimate, sometimes gory detail. It's not pretty.<br /><br />If you want to think about the glory of war, go rent a John Wayne Movie--\\"the Sands of Iwo Jima\\"or \\"he Fighting Seebees\\" would be good ones--but if you want to know why Sherman said, \\"War Is Hell,\\" and what war is really like from the soldier's point of view, read this book.<br /><br />Gripping, graphic, sobering and at times inspiring--but not in the way you think.<br /><br />This book deserves a 5-Star plus rating...and to say that men like Sledge are a part of \\"The Greatest Generation\\" does not do them justice.
1439107955|4.0|It's sad to learn that after all is said and done medicine has yet to make significant progress in treating cancer. The problem, as the book explains, is that cancer mutates and survives our best efforts to kill it.     The book could use some editing, as others have observed. Specifically, the book would be more readable if it adhered to the chronology of events that led to our present cellular-level understanding of cancer. It is disheartening to follow some treatment to the year 2004 only to be plunged back to the dark ages in the 60s.     I also had some reservations about such a junior member of the profession - a post doc fellow in oncology - taking on such an ambitious project. But I must say it's worthwhile reading.
B004DMAZQK|3.0|After practically burning out my copy of To Lose My Life, I was very anxious for this release, pre-ordered and everything.  I was so excited when it arrived and then I listened to it... By the end of the first listen, I was ready to shelf it for good.  I keep giving it a chance, and I keep putting it away again.  The heavy religious overtones are just too much in comparrison to the upbeat emo pop of their first album.  Here's hoping they keep at it and give us a third album that's a happy medium between the first two.  Experimentation is good, this was a little too much for me.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Clare Danes is wonderful in this true story. Everyone needs to see it. This is the best that entertainment can and should be.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|The title of this review says it all.  All of Aronofsky's films have been amazing, but Black Swan showcases his brilliance at a level as yet unseen.  Simply perfect.
1599218011|5.0|Excellent book, well written in a fun but informative format. I have followed the 21 day cleanse and could not be happier with the results. This book really opens your eyes to what America is eating, and the effects it is having on us and our children.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i really like the idea of having moving bosses. fun new levels and ideas. i just wish there were more levels ready to go out of the gate.
0670022411|5.0|I'm very happy to see the ratings for this book increase via this review process. When I first purchased it, I checked the reviews listed here and actually returned the hardcover copy and ordered a kindle sample. I finished the sample and couldn't wait until I obtained another copy to continue reading-  Lovely intelligent writing with facinating characters and perspectives. A complicated romance, good vs. evil, self discovery. Definitely 5 stars!!
1401201911|5.0|This book operates on a fascinating principle. What if Superman fell to earth a few hours earlier?    It's an interesting book. There are no heroes in this book, only anti-villains. Superman is trying to do what he thinks is best, but he's using surveillance, brain washing, and lobotomisation to achieve that. Lex Luthor is fighting for truth, justice, and the American way, but he's still the supervillain we know and love. Wonder Woman gets sucked into Superman's way of thinking before being tossed aside; when she fights to end Superman's corrupt rule, it's not for the good of the people but to get revenge for him not loving her. The closest to a hero is Batman (and his sexy ushanka). He's still fighting against the people who killed his parents, but this version is much more willing to kill, even if he tries to minimise the damages. So he's a bit more anti-hero.    The artwork is great, and the colours are true and vibrant. A lot of work was put in to determine how this brave new world would look. It's not just our world with a few more Soviet flags; it has a different design aesthetic. The best example would be in the Green Lantern Corps uniforms. The Red Son GLs don't look remotely like the DCU's GLs. The former have a far more militaristic look and feel.    The story is well thought out, and there are shout outs made to earlier Superman stories. There's stuff in here for every Superman fan. The only problem is sometimes a lot of stuff happens on one page. Also, characters are very briefly referenced and never show up again. (An example is Ma Kent.) However, the latter is done to make Superman fans happy so it's acceptable. Whilst it's a serious story, it's obvious Millar is having fun with it and wants the fans to have fun too.    Overall, it's a good book for fans of \\"What if\\" scenarios. Also, it's totally worth it just to see Batman in the ushanka.
0307270807|2.0|I first read this book some 30 years ago, not long after its publication. Even \\"splurged,\\" and bought the hard back version. I was impressed that he had tackled some subjects all too often eschewed by both the \\"main stream\\" media as well as some other books of the time. Michael Herr was one of the very first to do an \\"alt\\" version of the Vietnam War. I just re-read it, and, alas, found that the book (or at least my perceptions of it) did not age well.<br /><br />Michael Herr wrote the screenplay for the movie [[ASIN:B003XMXZCW Apocalypse Now (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]] which roughly adapted Joseph Conrad's [[ASIN:1936041103 Heart Of Darkness]] as a metaphor for the Vietnam War. And this included the subject quote, from Kurtz, as he was dying. Along with [[ASIN:0783225997 The Deer Hunter]], another early movie about the Vietnam war, I have felt that the adoption of stretched or outlandish metaphors (in the case of the Deer Hunter, it was Russian roulette) to convey the real horror of the war unnecessary, and even widely misses the mark. Why \\"gild the horror lily\\" as it were, when so much very real horror existed? All that was required was an observant eye and ear, and some factual reporting. I have always considered [[ASIN:B00006673L Hearts and Minds - Criterion Collection]] a painfully accurate documentary which won the best documentary award in 1974 as an infinitely superior movie for conveying the true horror of the war and a movie which invariably places more than one tear in the eye.<br /><br />Herr went to Vietnam in 1967 as a reporter, appears to have stayed around 18 months. He \\"hung\\" with the \\"stoner\\" crowd of reporters and photographers, Tim Page, Sean Flynn, and Dana Stone. All three did admirable work, the latter two died sometime after being captured by the Khmer Rouge. I've had a \\"soft spot\\" in my heart for Tim Page, particularly for his compilation of photographs taken by those who died in Indochina, entitled [[ASIN:B00008NRGM Requiem: By the Photographers Who Died in Vietnam and Indochina]]. But with Herr, although he hit several very true notes about the war, as mentioned below, my central frustration with the book was sorting out this pastiche of actual events, Vietnam \\"folk-lore,\\" and wild, drug-induced hallucinations. At some level, Herr \\"paid his dues,\\" and was at the Battle for Hue, during Tet in 1968, and visited the Marine base at Khe Sanh during the same period.<br /><br />A few specifics from the book: On page 95, the author says: \\"The very best of our divisions, the 1st Air Cavalry, was blooded in the Ia Drang that autumn, and while the official number of dead was released at around 300, I never met anyone who had been there, including officers of the Cav, who would settle for less than three or even four times that figure.\\" The number was 305, they are all on \\"the wall\\" in Washington, DC, and there is a very factual book on that battle is [[ASIN:034547581X We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang - the Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam]], written by Hal Moore and Joe Galloway, each of whom were there. Yes, the United States military command routinely greatly exaggerated NVA and VC casualties. But it was virtually impossible to minimize or distort the actual figures for American dead (there were those very real parents, etc...). On p. 101, Herr claims that a massive reaction force backed up Khe Sanh, totaling \\"...almost a quarter of a million men.\\" Yes, you can count some of the 1st Air Cav. and elements of the 101st Airborne, but \\"planners in Washington.\\"  Pleeeze. Herr does not consider the Montagnards to be nomadic (p. 93), so he apparently never read [[ASIN:1568360231 We Have Eaten the Forest: The Story of a Montagnard Village in the Central Highlands of Vietnam (Kodansha Globe)]]. There were a lot of more minor mistakes that a good proof editor would have caught: Page must have bought a Hasselblad camera in Hong Kong, not a \\"Halliburton\\" of Cheney fame (p. 240), and certainly Tam Ky is not located \\"near the mouth of the Perfume River\\" (p. 242)  but rather between Da Nang and Quang Ngai.<br /><br />But it was \\"the ears\\" that bothered me the most. To be quite clear, virtually all wars involve a \\"racist element,\\" and certainly the Vietnam War was in that category. American soldiers invariably referred to the Vietnamese, and with deference to the Amazon censor, by the \\"g-word.\\" Corpses of enemy soldiers were occasionally mutilated, and in certain extreme cases, their ears were removed. But I never saw it done, nor heard of any incidents during my year in the field with the 1/69th Armor, 4th Infantry Division. But with Herr, it seemed to be \\"de rigueur\\" for all American soldiers. Consider: \\"In the Highlands...I got stoned with some infantry from the 4th...There was a reedy little man in the circle who grinned all the time but hardly spoke...He pulled a thick plastic bag out of his pack and handed it over to me. It was full of what looked like large pieces of dried fruit...someone had told me once, there were a lot more ears than heads in Vietnam\\" (p. 34). Again, on page 199, \\"...a picture of a Marine holding an ear or maybe two ears or, as in the case of a guy I knew near Pleiku, a whole necklace made of ears, `love beads' as its owner called them...half the combat troops in Vietnam had these things in their packs, snapshots were the least of what they took after a fight, at least pictures didn't rot.\\"  No less than HALF! At another point, Herr has a soldier mailing an ear home to his girlfriend, who stopped writing him. On 204, Herr says: \\"I told him about the colonel who had threatened to court-martial a spec 4 for refusing to cut the heart out of a dead Viet Cong and feed it to a dog...\\" Is it any wonder \\"troubled-Vietnam-War-Veteran\\" has become one word?<br /><br />How likely was the following: \\"This was his third tour. In 1965 he'd been the only survivor in a platoon of the Cav wiped out going into the Ia Drang Valley. In '66 he'd come back with the Special Forces, and one morning after an ambush he'd hidden under the bodies of his team while the VC walked all around them with knives making sure...\\" As some other reviewers have reported, a lot Herr apparently just made up, with an \\"ear,\\" as it were, for the good horror story.<br /><br />Herr did have some moments of brilliance, reporting on the 5'oclock follies, and the occasional interviews with the brass. He brought a certain erudition to his reportage, knowing who Jules Roy and Alden Pyle were. And there were the well-turned observations phrased as: \\"...see if you could work together a count, the sponsor wasn't buying any dead civilians.\\"<br /><br />You want to do horror?  I would highly recommend the terrible flat affect, and honest reporting of Jonathan Schell in [[ASIN:B0012PN3LU The Military Half-an Acct of Destruction in Quang Ngai and Quang Tin]] and [[ASIN:B000IH3JD0 The Village of Ben Suc (A Vintage Book, V-431)]], and Neil Sheehan's [[ASIN:0679643613 A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam (Modern Library)]].

0061998494|4.0|I was a Craig fan before I read this book - and now, I'm even more of one.  Here's my take on the book to help you decide if it's for you:<br /><br />- The first half of the book - while he's going through his early family life and how he turned into a drunk, I didn't find as entertaining as the second half.  In fact, I have to admit I put it down for quite awhile before I picked it up again. Still, it's a necessary part of understanding his story - yet, it did initially lack the \\"comedic edge\\", I'd anticipated.<br /><br />- Where the story picks up is when as a guy that couldn't be more down and out starts to turn his life around.  It's entertaining, funny and touching all at the same time.  He may talk about his previous days of drinking - but it's not the drinking days that are interesting - it's this \\"coming to America to build a new life\\" that just grabbed me.<br /><br />- Once he starts trying to build a new life in CA from scratch, there's some fascinating insights into how hollywood works.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A poignant, amazing  \\"rebuilding one's life\\" story after hitting rock bottom -  that I think even those that aren't \\"Craig fans\\" will find inspiring.<br /><br />-

B004SKHJF2|5.0|I have been using this app for years. It is very good at identifying music even in loud and crowded environments like bars and restaurants. This version includes several features that the free version doesn't including unlimited tagging. Another great feature is offline tagging, so you can tag a song and it will save the audio clip if you do not have an internet connection. Once you have an internet connection again, it will identify the song for you.    Great app, definitely a must have!
0545265355|5.0|These books are FANTASTIC,  They are absolutely the best books I have read in the last year.  The surreal life of Katniss and Peeta keeps you reading page after page until you find that you have read all three books.  Then you want to read them over again.  I haven't felt like this about any book since the Twilight series and Water for Elephants.  I bought a set for a friend at Christmas and had never read them myself. He loaned me his to read when he was finished because he thought they were so good.  I couldn't put them down and when I finished his, I ordered my own set.  I actually can't wait to read them again and will as soon as I finish the book I am reading right now.  Cosmopolis.  Can't wait for the Hunger Games movie to come out.  I hope they have good actors and actresses and are able to film all three stories.
B003UESJF6|4.0|I have to say, maybe I dropped my review from 4 to 3.5 stars due to watching a funnier, cuter movie right before it but it's still worth your $$ and 3.5 - 4 stars is a very respectable rating.<br />You may wonder what I watched right before it? Despicable Me. Yeah, that was so cute and funny that Megamind kinda seemed to fall short.<br />But, I will still rate it pretty good since it definately does entertain and has extra features that are pretty good as well.<br />Trailers I had seen had shown Megamind (Will Ferrel) as simply an anti-hero and he was fighting Titan (Jonah Hill). This is not the case. If you saw that trailer, do not be fooled.<br />It is a story of - Lets say - Superman didn't fall to a little homestead in Kansas but to a prison instead? What if every time he tried to make friends, it just backfired and he eventually realized that he is good at being bad? But, another alien took your destiny from you and has had the good life (Metro Man - Brad Pitt)? Battles occur between the two that they both follow the rules of, \\"thou shalt not kill but only imprison.\\" until one of Megamind's ultimate weapons \\"kills\\" Metro Man. Now, he has no enemy, is bored and decides to create a new hero using Metro Man's DNA. This backfires as all his plans do and the hero (Titan) decides to be a villian. Titan does not follow any rules and steals, destroys, even tries to kill Megamind and the reporter Roxi (voiced by Tina Fey).<br />Megamind and his minion (a fish with a mecha-gorilla body voiced by David Cross) must find a way to stop Titan.<br />I like Jonah Hill in most of his work but here in this movie he is a nerd that you don't feel sorry for and he is a loser for more reason than one. If they had given us a better reason to hate him, I'd have liked his villian character more. Simply being imbalanced mentally is not a fun villian.<br />The only reason it's not a 5 star movie is that it is for the best of the best or something that blows you away. This won't do that. It's worth the $$ and is entertaining. The special features are worth watching as well. You will not feel shorted.s entertaining. The special features are worth watching as well.

1936594293|4.0|The marriage, property and inheritance laws of the late 18th and early 19th century, by today's standards, can be considered cruelly misogynistic.<br /><br />The Bennett family estate is entailed and, as Mr Bennett's family consists of his wife and five daughters (nary a son in sight), there is a strong likelihood that, when he passes away, the six surviving ladies will be left homeless and with no income or property. Mrs Bennett is deeply concerned with the situation and frantically searches for the expedient solution of the day (marriage to an eligible man of property whose family would provide her daughters with both a home and settlement of a suitable annual stipend for living expenses). On the other hand, Mr Bennett's approach is much more relaxed and he gives the impression that he feels the marriage of his daughters will take care of itself in due course and that all will ultimately turn out for the best.<br /><br />PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, told primarily from the point of view of Elizabeth Bennett, the most sensible daughter in a family of ladies whose general attitude seems to be quite vapid and utterly self-centered, is a story driven not so much by plot as by character development combined with a comedic critique of the issues of early 19th century mores among the landed gentry - manners, upbringing, morality, education, marriage, conventions, etiquette, leisure, societal behaviour and so on. It might be compared to a much more modern equivalent in F Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY or on a considerably lighter note, television's famous sitcom SEINFELD. The common factor here ... in a background of purely social commentary, nothing of note really happens. The social commentary IS the story!<br /><br />PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has withstood the onslaught of time and remains to this day (and justifiably so) one of the most popular novels in the entire pantheon of English literature.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weiss
0375850864|4.0|There are no spoilers in this review.    Almost from the beginning, WHEN YOU REACH ME builds your suspense and anticipation one short chapter at a time.  It is definitely a fun book to read.  The suspenseful plot development builds almost like an Alfred Hitchcock thriller.  It's still enjoyable along the way watching the characters change and grow.  And it's quite refreshing to read a contemporary children's novel which takes place in the 1970s -- a rare thing these days.  Most books in that genre are either taking place in today's technologically exhaustive world or in the Depression (an educating time to read about, but today's youth may be too far removed to appreciate).    WHEN YOU REACH ME may have a complicated plot to some, but the story unfolds at a fairly even pace.  It does require a close eye and attention to detail.  My primary problem with it is the conclusion of the very mysterious plot.  I think it would have been good for the author to add on an extra fifty pages or so in order to better develop the conclusion and the character(s) which bring it about.  I finished the book thinking, \\"That was it?  That was pretty good, but I kinda wish there had been more!\\"    All in all, not too bad.  3.5 Stars.

0756404738|5.0|A handful of years ago, my son and I were on our way to a hockey game in downtown St. Paul. As we headed toward the arena, I happened to look across the street and see Patrick Rothfuss walking in the opposite direction. Naturally, having loved his first book, THE NAME OF THE WIND, I altered my course and stepped up to him on the corner, my child in tow.    After some menial banter, most of which involved his being surprised that anyone would recognize him on the street, talk turned to THE WISE MAN'S FEAR, the delayed sequel to his masterful debut. Impatience was brewing in the fantasy readership due to the delay, and so I asked him what the nature of the postponement was. His response was blunt: \\"I don't want it to suck.\\"    After a few more minutes talking, I left our discussion and continued toward the arena. As disappointed as I had been with the waiting involved in the new novel's release, I left that impromptu meeting rather impressed and more than willing to wait for however long Rothfuss felt it was going to take to make this book the very best it could be.    Now, THE WISE MAN'S FEAR is in bookstores, and the question needs to be asked: Has it lived up to the expectations? The shortest possible answer is \\"Yes!\\" And then some.    Much like its predecessor, THE WISE MAN'S FEAR alternates between Kvothe Kingkiller, our hero, chronicling his life for an inquisitive soul, and interludes that occur in the present time for Kvothe. In these pages, readers continue on the path that unfolds as Kvothe recounts his quest for the truth about the Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe continues to grow and learn, moving ever closer to being the legend who now sits and tells us his story.    Kvothe remains a supremely interesting and entertaining character to follow, particularly with the layout of this novel. Readers spend time in the Waystone Inn where a retired Kvothe reflects on his life. The life he recounts is that of a 15-year-old thrust into the larger world where he defies all odds and builds himself into a legend. As a strapping young buck, Kvothe also begins the transformation from boy to man, which involves some time spent in the arms of the ladies. This is all handled tastefully.    Rothfuss fills the novel with detail, not overbearing enough to weigh down the pace but just enough to vividly bring Kvothe and his world to life. He does a supremely strong job of providing additional characters to interact with Kvothe, particularly Maer Alveron. He also delivers with a style that's pure lyrical beauty, as if the story itself were a song laid bare on the page. It truly is a remarkable feat and a pleasure to experience.    THE WISE MAN'S FEAR is an exemplary work, full of action, depth and humor. At nearly 1,000 pages, it gives definition to the term \\"epic fantasy.\\" It seems bigger than the pages and is a world that should not be missed. My only hope is that it won't take four more years for the follow-up to roll off the press. Even if it does, Rothfuss has proven that if you have to wait, you'll be rewarded.        --- Reviewed by Stephen Hubbard

0316017922|1.0|And then there's just plain exaggeration to tell a good story and court the intellectual fashions of the day, which are Gladwell's faults.  He goes to interesting sources such as Geert Hofstede's Cultures and Organizations, biographies out of Silicon Valley, or Richard Flynn's work on intelligence, or the remarkable KIPP schools, and takes highly selected and anecdotal evidence to tell amazing yarns and breathe new life into hopes for equality which have remained unfilled for decades.<br /><br />He argues by anecdote to have you believe that almost all success is due to incredibly hard work.  The argument has some substance - an awful lot of success is attributable to tremendously hard work - but it also involves native ability, a fact which Gladwell would wish away.  He totally, seemingly wilfully overlooks evidence that doesn't go his way, rather like Stephen Jay Gould a quarter century ago.<br /><br />He tells us about the 10,000 hour rule for expertise.  This theory, which arose in the field of psychology during the 1990s, holds that it takes 10,000 hours of experience to become a bona fide expert.  Common sense tells you, but Gladwell does not, that this is a kind of rule of thumb.  Also it is a continuum.  If you were to listen to a violinist after 9000 hours of practice, and then again after 11,000 hours, the differences would be subtle.  Moreover, there are some domains, such as music and certain realms of the law, in which common sense would tell you that practice will lead to this kind of expertise and others where it will not, such as mathematics and theoretical physics.  I would recommend that any of Gladwell's readers Google this theory and decide for themselves how applicable it is.<br /><br />His examples include Bill Gates and Bill Joy working incredibly hard at developing their programming expertise, which Gladwell concludes put them in a position to build Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.  He also talks about lawyer Joe Flom of Skadden Arps.  Well and good.  Gladwell would have you believe that the patterns in coincidences he sees are absolutely compelling.  They are interesting, but they are not the whole story.  He doesn't tell you what an absolute dilettante Larry Ellison of Oracle was, how he basically wasted his life until he was about 30 doing whatever he pleased.  It doesn't tell you about Pierre Omidyar of eBay who had his genius idea, started a company, gave it to a competent manager in Meg Whitman, and stepped back to enjoy it.  It doesn't offer a theory about polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci, Descartes, Poincare, Swedenborg and others who made contributions to so many fields that they could not have possibly invested 10,000 hours in becoming expert in all of them.  He overlooks the fact that Gates' genius was in business even more than programming.  The 10,000 hour theory doesn't offer an explanation for math and theoretical physics geniuses whose insights typically start coming to them before the age of 20.  In other words, it is interesting but limited.  Gladwell doesn't tell you that.<br /><br />One of Gladwell's major, consistent, beat you over the head themes is that intelligence is not a deciding factor.  In making this claim he says that Einstein's IQ was only 150.  Excuse me?  You don't have to be Einstein to know that's probably wrong.  I went to school with kids that smart, and let me tell you, they were no Einsteins.  Einstein never took an IQ test, but every Internet source which offered a guess put it in the realm of 160 or above.  Gladwell also declines to mention the measured and reported IQs of guys like Warren Buffett, Gates, Joy and Myhrvold, which are astronomical.  Instead, he says that anything over maybe 140 is wasted.  Absolutely untrue.  Being majorly smart is a major advantage in life.  Who woudda  thunk?<br /><br />He drags out one certifiable genius who is not a resounding success to make the fairly obvious point that genius isn't everything.  He overlooked a second - the Unabomber.  These are anecdotes.  Gladwell loves anecdotes almost to the exclusion of boring stuff such as statistical justifications.<br /><br />In another bit of dubious fun with numbers, he lists the 75 richest people of all times, with John D Rockefeller heading the list.  Certainly he has experts to cite for this, but even a casual reader will have to concede that an attempt to compare the monetary wealth of Bill Gates and Cleopatra requires a few, ahem, simplifying assumptions.  Wealth can be measured a vast number of ways, among them spendable money, real estate, ownership of production, ownership of people, or the ability to direct human labor.  Cleopatra didn't exactly spend US dollars circa 2010.  In any case, when he discovers that almost 20 percent of his list were born within a nine year period around 1840, you can come to one of two conclusions.  Gladwell concludes it is an amazing coincidence.  I would suggest maybe it is an amazing list.  I will not claim that there is no substance to his argument, but as always, Gladwell is a little bit too breathless, and the list is more than a little bit contrived.<br /><br />Gladwell argues that vast success is a matter of being in the right place at the right time, which certainly does not hurt, but it is not as decisive as he would have you believe.  Every age has produced new opportunities, and people who were conspicuously successful in exploiting those opportunities.  No mention of Sergei Brin, Andy Grove, Henry J. Kaiser or others whose success doesn't precisely fit his parameters.<br /><br />He is a supporter of the KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program) schools, as am I.  Teaching every child to the extent of his abilities is a great idea.  KIPP kids are overwhelmingly from the most disadvantaged sectors of society.  Just learning to show up in school, do your work, and be a responsible employee is a tremendous step forward.  Gladwell reports that 90% of KIPP alumni go to college, a remarkable number and worth reporting.  He is quiet about what happens next, and Googling \\"KIPP alumni\\" doesn't reveal any overwhelming successes, despite the fact that the program is approaching 20 years of existence.  If most of the kids have jobs, it is a tremendous success.  If nobody has started the next Facebook, well, it was an extreme uphill battle even with sponsorship.<br /><br />Gladwell is a popular writer because he tells the kind of myths that our popular culture wants to believe.  He would have us accept that Asians are not as smart as they appear, and ghetto kids are a lot smarter than you would believe.  He asks us to think that the things that set them apart are largely cultural.  He makes a huge deal out of the difference between wet rice farming and any other way of making a living off the land, then draws major conclusions about the Chinese.  Rice farming has made Chinese what they are.  What about Indians, Thais, Viets, Indians, Filipinos and others who practice this agrarian art?  Didn't work the same for them.  Not a mention...<br /><br />I would advocate that anybody reading this book also go to Gladwell's primary sources.  Take a look at \\"Cultures and Organizations,\\" and perhaps my Amazon review of it which calls into question the strength of the conclusions which the authors draw on the basis of their statistical factor analysis.  Read Anders Ericcson's many publications on the 10,000 hours to expertise theory.  Take a look at Flynn's work on intelligence, and that of Arthur Jensen and Richard Lynn, all three of whom speak highly of each other's work, and whom I have reviewed, and see if you conclude that measured intelligence is unimportant in individuals and/or groups.  Examine the statistical analysis performed specifically to control for cultural factors, such as studies of identical twins raised in vastly different cultural settings.<br /><br />My conclusion is that in almost every case there is some substance to Gladwell's happy tales, but in general they are vastly overstated.  He is a good craftsman with a gift for saying what people want to hear.  I am sure he will always be successful, and probably continue to be influential beyond the merit of his work.

0070511136|5.0|I would recommend this \\"old\\" book to people that are new to sales. It gives a great introduction to what sales actually is. It is far removed from hard-selling snake oil.

If you're experienced in sales, I don't think you will find this book very valuable.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I watched this the other day and all I can say is it was amazing! The movie tells the story of Alice Marilyn \\"Ali\\" Rose (played by Christina Aguilera), a small town girl from Iowa, who dreams of a better life as a singer in Los Angles. After getting settled in she hits the town and finds the club known as Burlesque. She enters the club as the co-owner of the club named Tess (played by Cher) sings the club's theme song \\"Welcome to Burlesque\\". As Alice watches Tess perform she realizes this is the hope she'd been looking for. While at the bar Alice meets and makes friends with the bartender, Jack (played by Cam Gigandet), whom she assumes to be gay due to his outward appearance, who tells her to let Tess know he sent her, so as she goes to pursue this, Tess and her long-time friend, Sean (played by Stanley Tucci) shoot her down and she begins to wait tables, without anyone but Jack's knowledge until Tess catches her and to Alice's luck Jack comes to her rescue claiming he hired her, but Tess knows better but allows it anyway with a warning to \\"Never pull that again\\". Soon after she starts going under the name Ali. As time goes by Ali watches the dancers and memorizing their routines in her mind. She soon starts to try and press her opinions on Tess to help raise money for the club by allowing the girl dancers to sing live instead of lip-syncing since the audience has seen the acts and the girls do it several times and the routine is running old but Tess, stubborn as she is, refuses to listen and has Ali brushed back to wait tables. Not too long after that Ali returns home to find her apartment broken into, with no where to go or anyone one else to turn to she runs to Jack, who allows her to stay with him until she can find a new place. The next day Ali finds out that Jack is not gay, but that he's engaged and tries to leave but Jack won't let her cause the weather is horrible. The story goes on pretty much the same with the exception that I forgot to mention that Tess' ex-husband, Vincent (played by Peter Gallagher), who is the other co-owner of Burlesque is trying to get Tess' half of the money for the club but soon gives up and starts trying to convince her to let them sell to Marcus (played by Eric Dane), a greedy and money hungry man who will do what every he can to get what he wants. In the end its Ali, who eventually ends up a dancer, who saves Burlesque twice, once by singing live due to Nikki (played by Kristen Bell) trying to sabotage her cause Tess sent Nikki home early due to her being drunk and sent Ali out in her place and once again towards the end of the film.<br /><br />These musical sequences are featured in the film:<br /># \\"Something's Got a Hold on Me (Christina Aguilera)\\" - Ali<br /># \\"Welcome to Burlesque (instrumental)\\" - The Burlesque Lounge Girls<br /># \\"Welcome to Burlesque (Cher)\\" - Tess and the Burlesque Lounge Girls<br /># \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend (Marilyn Monroe & Jane Russel)\\" - Nikki, Georgia and the Burlesque Lounge Girls<br /># \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend (outro by Christina Aguilera)\\" - Ali<br /># \\"Long John Blues (Megan Mullally)\\" - Nikki<br /># \\"Wagon Wheel Watusi (Elmer Bernstein)\\" - Ali<br /># \\"Ray of Light (Madonna)\\" - Ali and the Burlesque Lounge Girls<br /># \\"Tough Lover (Etta James)\\" - Ali and two Burlesque Lounge Girls<br /># \\"Tough Lover (Christina Aguilera)\\" - Ali and two Burlesque Lounge Girls<br /># \\"But I Am a Good Girl (Christina Aguilera)\\" - Ali<br /># \\"Guy What Takes His Time (Christina Aguilera)\\" - Ali<br /># \\"Express (Christina Aguilera)\\" - Ali and the Burlesque Lounge Girls<br /># \\"Jungle Berlin (instrumental)\\" - Alexis and the contorsionists<br /># \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me (Cher)\\" - Tess<br /># \\"Bound To You (Christina Aguilera)\\" - Ali<br /># \\"Show Me How You Burlesque (Christina Aguilera)\\" - Ali and the Burlesque Lounge Dancers<br /><br />This movie is great and a must have if you are a fan of Cher's or Christina Aguilera's or even musicals in general. You won't be disappointed. Guess the song is true too by the way, \\"we haven't seen the last of Cher\\".een the last of Cher\\".

0061726826|5.0|It is 6:20am and I have not been to bed yet due to the fact that I was up finishing this book.  That should speak for itself.  All I can say is WOW.  Lauren Oliver knows how to hook you and keep you reading.  This was a fantastic, outstanding novel.<br /><br />First, the characterization of Lena was brilliant.  This is a girl who has always admired the society she lives in, believed whole-heartedly in its rules and regulations, and looked forward to the day when she would receive the \\"cure\\" for love.  The way the author systematically and carefully peals away Lena's layers of stubborn belief was brilliant.  Watching her fall in love against her better judgement was almost agonizing because she is doing it despite believing that love is a horrible disease and her internal struggle was often heartbreaking to witness.  She grows so much as a character during the course of this story and I love what she becomes.<br /><br />Alex was a patient, loving character that gently leads Lena toward the truth.  I don't want to say too much more about him for fear of ruining the story for others, but suffice it to say that I fell in love with him.  He was kind, brave, smart, and loving.<br /><br />All the characters in this story were well drawn, despite the fact that many of them had to be somewhat lacking in personality because of the nature of the cure's affect on one's personality.  The author has done a fabulous job here by letting these people be real, three-dimensional characters while still maintaining their emotionlessness.<br /><br />There are so many amazing themes and messages in this story that I almost wanted to read it over again as soon as I finished it.  The pacing was fast, and a couple surprises await near the end.  It seems as if the ending leaves a tiny speck of room for there to be a sequel, but I haven't read anything to confirm that.  I hope so!<br /><br />Despite the fact that I read this book from a publisher galley, I am eagerly awaiting the release in February, as I must buy a copy for my keeper shelf.  I have nothing but the highest praise for this book and its author.  Mark February 1 on your calendars and get a copy of this book!!er shelf.

0670022411|5.0|I could not put this down. This is for every girl who wanted to be Samantha as a child. It is smart, witty and fun. I can't wait for the next installment and hope this will be a trilogy at least. The concept of a witch in denial and a vampire who is a renaissance man literally is really intriging.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Love, love, love it. And it's FREE, what's not to love. Just spent 11hrs in car with 2 kids and it was a total hit. Thanks Amazon!
B001E45XT4|5.0|I Have a 2010 HP Mini Note book and This head set works Amazing with Skyping back home from Afganistan. The only Down side is I had to get the 2-1 Prong so i could plug it into my computer but its worked for me everyday i call My Family. The Headset is Very Comfortable (A little Bulky) and the sound Quallity is Amazing. I will definatly Suggest to all my friends.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|but is kidding us all  The Angry Birds is great but must be downloaded using Google   much faster than using this..... app store   Strange business model...
B004SKHJF2|5.0|had free version forever. amazon appstore free download for encore version?  thanks amazon! app works well. installed just fine. get it while its free and you will not regret it.<br /><br />droid x
B004SKHJF2|5.0|First off, this is the full version of shazam which has unlimited tagging. The other version has restrictions. It's amazing that amazon is giving this away for free today
B001M5UDGS|5.0|So clever. I wish I was this clever. But if I was, Dr Horrible would probably come after me and steal my brain.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This app is amazing.<br /><br />True Story: Last fall I was watching a football game on TV. As they went to commercial the stadium sound system started to play a song, I could hear it in the background as the TV announcers talked over it. I \\"knew\\" the song from my younger days, but couldn't recall the name or the group.  I grabbed by Droid X, loaded the recorder app, rewound the DVR and recorded the song snippet to my phone. Next day I played this snippet for nearly 20 people, hoping that someone would recognize it. No one did.<br /><br />I pretty much forgot about it.<br /><br />Today, March 25, 2011, four and a half months later, I try Amazon's free offer of Shazam. After reading what the app is supposed to do, I recall this recording from Oct. 2010. I load Shazam, load the recording (both on the same phone), hit Play, quickly switch back to Shazam, hit Listen. Shazam listens, analyzes....and comes up with a match! I knew immediately that it had gotten it right, first try; Driver's Seat by Sniff n' the Tears, from 1978.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this recording was only about 8 seconds long, from the stadium sound system, with people talking over it in the foreground, recorded from a TV, to a phone.<br /><br />Shazam, I am impressed!
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Was amazed when I went to start of a random reggae song and it guessed it from just the start of a melody. Impressive! And you can do so much from watch YouTube video or listen on Pandora from the results!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Won't install..  put it on the android market so I can play it!  I don't know what else to say but apparently have to use 25 words to share my opinion.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I played the game for two days and after beating the third world, thats it? Thr ornery worlds remain locked and are dated. Next world not available until may? Why put the game out if it's not completed? Bummed.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|there ARE better things out there plus don't try to sell you stuff when you're done, luckly I got the premium version for free. I wouldn't pay 5 dollars for this app
B001P3OMY6|5.0|Austenland had everything that I expected from Shannon Hale: humor, bit of romance, and an enjoyable read.  Loved this book, fulfilled many of my own Austen daydreams about Mr. Darcy and life in Regency England.  Recommend this to anyone with a love for Jane Austen!
B004SKHJF2|4.0|I originally was using sound hound but since amazon was offering Shazam for free I downloaded it and it actually is pretty good, yeah it is not that fast the first time you use it but it has progressively gotten faster with use.
0790729407|3.0|My birthday is St. Patrick's Day, and I'm Irish. I've have family members and friends' grandparents who actually lived through all this before coming to America. I'm no slouch in my Irish history department. That being said, never let history get in the way of a good story, especially if it's being filmed.    Rather than debate the historical inaccuracies, or the lame love story subplot, or Julia Roberts performance, \\"Michael Collins\\" is a good, solid film, raised up by Liam Neeson as the Big Fella, Alan Rickman as Dev, and solid supporting turns by Aidan Quinn and Stephan Rea. It also looks darn good. Plus it's a serious attempt to unravel 20th century Irish rebellion and civil war. It ain't \\"Braveheart\\" but it tries hard.    For all it's strengths - and there are many - it doesn't really measure up as an epic. To mention this film in the same sentence as \\"David Lean\\" is laughable. Rent \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" (no slouch itself in historical inaccuracies) or \\"Bridge Over the River Kwai\\" and THEN watch this film. Not.     Acting aside, it drags on. Attempts too much. Doesn't deliver. Rent \\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\\" instead. What \\"Michael Collins\\" attempts to explain, \\"...Barley\\" delivers with a gripping story, great acting, and real shots to the heart.     To quote Marianne Faithfull's song, \\"Ireland. Ireland. When will you be free?\\"
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like just about everybody, I have the original Angry Birds.  Kind of bored with it at this point, since I also have the holiday version and have been getting all the updates.  Look at chance on this one though and I am glad I did.  Graphics are much better, interface is good, the story line is fun.  Same basic game, but a new twist. if you like Angry Birds, you will love it!
B002ZG980U|4.0|I had seen this movie in theaters when it first came out and I fell in love with it! It kindof reminds me of A Beautiful Mind in a sense. Brilliant script, without a doubt!<br />The only bad thing is that when I recieved the package, the bottom of the case had broken into a bunch of tiny pieces, but it looked like it wasnt done by the shipper itself, the postal guy probably banged it around a little, but movie worked great!
0756404738|4.0|While still a really, really good read, Part II is not as good as the first book.  It drags in parts, lacks the grittiness of the first novel and only show glimpses of the main character's powers, which I was hoping to see more of in this second installment.  Having said that, nobody currently writes as seamlessly as this author, the characters are still great, if not better than in the first book and I would highly recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|the game is really cool. but why sell through the amazon app market. seems kinda lame considering android users already has a market. makes no sense.     the game rocks, the process to get the game is completely stupid. im giving it 1 star only because the devs need to realize how stupid it is going into a market to download yet another market to finally download the game. SKIP THE MIDDLE!!
B001HN697M|5.0|I got the first two movies in this series and wanted to add this. It showed up quickly and I gave it a look. I found it to be worth the purchase. It showed how the battle between the Lycans and the vampires began and cleared up a few things for me. I look forward to seeing the next one when it comes out.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome addition to the angry bird family! Love it! No issues with the download. Same great gameplay with new scenery, etc. The only thing people seem to be complaining about is the availability which is U.S. only.
0674049160|5.0|I treated myself to a beautiful hardcover edition of Pride and Prejudice. I'm a great admirer of Jane Austen, a very special woman who understood (by watching, looking, and listening) her world. The book that I received is a special copy of one of my all-time favorites. It is a treasure that I will read over and over again.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great graphics, fun game play, and smooth performance make this a top notch game for your high end android device. I would definately recommend this game to Angry Birds fans.
0061743526|5.0|When I think about what makes a wonderful human being, I immediately say Atticus Finch. This extraordinary 50th anniversary edition is a treasure to read again and again. All the characters portrayed are so alive and special.  And the depiction of the South was true to the time. Harper Lee is a marvelous writer who cares about her characters and her place in history.
6305014140|5.0|This was actually one of the first anime I ever saw when I was younger.  The art direction in this film is amazing, the cinematography and image design are a reflection of what live action Hollywood films have been lacking for years.  A total inspiration and what an action-filled ninja flick should be.  Any true anime fan needs this in their collection.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app is AWESOME! It seems like a fresh idea where new levels unlock each specified month. That way, you dont beat it all at once, and get bored. i havent had any issues like force closes or anything. The graphics are spectacular, and the new Samba-like music is catchy. definitely, DEFINITELY get it! :D<br />Oh, I forgot...when I first started to download it, a notice popped up that said, &quot;Angry Birds Rio is not compatible with your device, but if you'd still like to download it, visit this link..&quot; Then, when I went back in to the Amazon App, it was downloaded, and gave me the option to &quot;Open,&quot; and it works perfectly!
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|This is right behind All Things Must Pass as George's best album imo ...there's not a clunker in here . Faster and Blow Away got a little airplay but are pretty much forgotten . Sweet Dark Lady is a beautiful ballad as is Soft Touch ..Not Guilty which was available on Beatle bootlegs and later released on Anthology 3 is really pretty  too .  A great overlooked album by one of the Beatles .
B004N62KTG|5.0|I have all of Lady GaGa's main remix EPs of every single she released and I have to say, this is one of my favorite remix EP's, and it only has 4 tracks! The packaging is really cool, because it comes in a slim digipak (cardboard) case, which is better than the regular jewel case that comes with one piece of paper that has just the cover on it. This digipak coesn't come with a booklet, but inside the digipak is the lyrics and song credits, which was nicely done. It's a very impressive packaging.       The original version of the song goes great as the opener for it, with it's thumping bass and loud melody with a message. The other 3 remixes are amazing. It begins with the LA Riots Remix. It's nothing extremely special, but it has a very nice energy and while it's 6 1/2 minutes long, it doesn't drag on too much. The Chew Fu Born To Fix Remix is one of my favorites with that cool repetitive synth during the verses and I love the handclaps and how it changes the beat, but my favorite is the DJ White Shadow remix. It starts with a catchy melody and finally goes into a thumping dance beat with some great synths.        These are some amazing remixes, and if you love remixes and Lady GaGa, then you should definitely get this. Also, I can't wait for Part 2!
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|My daughter loved it!
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This was a wonderful true story, if you love Dogs or any animal, this is the movie for you. It shows the love and devotion between people and Dogs, and how that love can be so strong, it made me laugh and made me cry, it's perfect for the whole family.   You have to see this movie to believe it, what a Dog's love can do and we don't give enough credit to how these animals really feel.They go through pain and sadness just like we do, and this film shows all that, please see this film, I will never forget it.  Anna Alfano
B002ZG976U|5.0|I already knew that I would find something to love in this movie, if only because it featured the iconic Cher, who I have adored since her Sonny & Cher Show days when I was in high school.<br />  Not being a particular Christina fan, however, I was also prepared to find things not to love, especially in light of the less than favorable reviews that the movie received.<br />  As I watched, the three main thoughts that kept running through my mind were:<br /><br />1) OMG--Cher is still absolutely amazing!!<br />2) Wow--Christina is actually really good in this--natural acting, great voice, totally acquitting herself well in her first film effort<br />3) I can't believe that the critics bashed this movie the way they did--they're all too elitist for their own damn good!<br /><br />  Yes, this is an old-fashioned, seen-it-a-hundred-times plot line about a country girl trying to make good in the big city. And yes, it pretty much hits on all the old cliches: . . .<br />*the wide-eyed innocent who succeeds against all odds by virtue of her explosive raw talent<br />*the tough but tender Tess who gives her a chance despite her  initial reservations<br />*the witty, fabulously supportive gay BFF who's hopelessly devoted to Diva Tess<br />*the scheming,jealous leading lady soon to be ousted by the 'new kid'<br />*the cute, charming, almost too-good-to-be-true boyfriend with the requisite bitchy ex-girlfriend and a way with those packaged cookies!<br />*the sexy but devious villain who the girls manage to outsmart in the end<br /><br /> . . . and yes it's all pure sentimental, predictable corniness.<br />  But all these so-called \\"faults\\" were the very things I loved about it. It was an old-school over-the-top musical extravaganza with comfortable time-tested themes, uncomplicated emotions,lavish musical numbers, and lots of hot girls in sumptuous costumes showing us how they Burlesque! And--sorry, movie critics--but what the heck is wrong with that??<br />  It certainly wasn't sophisticated entertainment, but you feel good all the way through it, and finish it in an upbeat, happy frame of mind, the only cloud darkening your horizon being the thought that no matter what happens, you will never, ever, look as good as Cher!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Even better than the original, and without the ads! I would happily pay for this app, but for now its FREE! Bad reviews must be user error, because I have not had a single issue.
B001853NZK|5.0|Item was just as described.  Perfect for holding a ton of pages for sports cards, stamps, coins, etc.<br /><br />Arrived very quickly.
B000002BQK|4.0|It's the album that many fans proclaim her best work, and also an album that many non-fans like despite the fact that it is by Mariah Carey.  Mariah herself has essentially proclaimed this album to be her magnum opus, since it was \\"so special\\" and is one of her favorite albums she has made to this day.  She had a lot of emotional issues to work through here, and it shows.  It seems that the butterfly metaphor fit her life very well during this era, as she emerged from a highly dysfunctional cocoon and was finally free to be more herself, artistically and personally.  This metaphor has stuck with her, literally and figuratively, ever since.  She is never seen without a butterfly somewhere, usually a ring on her finger, and all of her albums, promotions, and logos have since included the image of a butterfly.  And don't even get me started on the whole fashion line she's come out with. But that's for a different review.    On Butterfly, many people insist that Mariah's singing totally changed overnight to a whispery vocal that could barely be understood.  I disagree.  I think that there is no pre-1997 and post-1997 Mariah. The only difference is in her clothing, which would not have been an issue had it not been for the marriage to Mottola to begin with.  She would have been wearing those skimpy outfits starting in 1990, not 1997, if she'd had the choice.  Even so, if you actually watch some of her very earliest footage of different awards shows and other appearances, you can see that she doesn't exactly dress prudishly all the time - like she did from 1992-1996 - I'm sure I saw some short, tight dresses in those first two years of her career.  Artistically, I feel that this album is the continuation of a journey which started with her very first album.  Daydream started veering a little more hip-hop heavy, and Butterfly just continues this direction.      Yes, she still throws out a ballad like \\"Whenever You Call\\" and \\"My All.\\"  But what makes this album interestingto me is not her ballads. I like a lot of her other ballads better on her prior albums.  What is interesting here is her very introspective songs.  There were a couple of these on Daydream, and she gets even more personal on Butterfly.  The fact is, Mariah can write (or co-write) a very catchy song.  And she can write very poignant lyrics.  And she does not need her entire vocal range to convey an emotion; the soft singing she exhibits here is perfect for setting the mood on these songs.      Here are my favorites.  She has written them about her life, but they can be applied to tough situations in anyone's life (and the lyrics here are a lot more profound than the hackneyed lyrics in her earlier hit \\"Hero\\").    \\"Close My Eyes\\"  is a beautiful song, understated, talking about childhood troubles still haunting her in her late 20s.  (\\"I was a wayward child/with the weight of the world/that I held deep inside...And I close my eyes/steady my feet on the ground/raise my head to the sky/and time rolled by/still feel like a child as I look at the moon/maybe I grew up a little too soon\\").  Really, if you can't relate to these lyrics, you've led a very plush life.  And the majority of us envy you.      \\"Outside\\" is a song that she wrote about growing up biracial and feeling very \\"ambiguous\\" and without a place.  The lyrics are open enough for interpretation so anyone who has ever felt left out or different can relate.      \\"Breakdown\\" is with Bone Thugs 'n Harmony accompanying.  It is a very catchy, rapid-fire song, very reminiscent of the sound on Bone Thugs' hit \\"Crossroads\\" which was a radio staple just a couple years before this song.  The song talks about putting on a brave face in public when all she really wants to do is have a complete breakdown and cry.  I think we've all done that before, whether it is regarding love or some other issue in life.      And finally, \\"Babydoll\\" is worth mentioning.  It isn't the most introspective song on here, but I love the funky, irregular beat in the background.  Just based on the beat, you can tell that Missy Elliot worked on this if you are at all familiar with Missy's quirky musical style and her odd, almost Salvador Dali-esque music videos back in the '90s.  But really, I just love the interesting harmony that Mariah and company puts together when singing the chorus: \\"I want to be your babydoll/wrap me up/nice and tight/love me all through the night\\"    The rest of the songs on this album are just purely fun (i.e. \\"Honey\\" ) or beautiful (like \\"Fourth of July\\").  I'd give this album a solid rating.  It is an album you need to be in a mood to actually listen to the lyrics to get the full value; and when you do listen to the lyrics, they speak more volumes than the octaves Mariah's voice possesses.
0345441184|5.0|Quite possibly my favorite book. Rich characters, poignant tragedy, moody, misty. What more do you need to know?  In brief, each well-known character is seen from a new perspective, from the side one of the priestesses of the goddess, who is constantly torn between staying true to the people she cares for or exploiting them to save her people's ancient beliefs from extinction.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable - for a free game or not. Guaranteed addictive if liked the original.<br />The 25 word minimum for reviews is a little silly dont you think?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Beautiful graphics.... fun new twists on the game.  Lots of fun helping the poor kidnapped birds escape!  But I keep coming back to the graphics... really beautiful on my Droid X.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|I tried quite a number of subject documents, and I also tried unloading and reloading the app.  But try as I might, every picture I took resulted in horizontal, tight, multi-colored lines.  I could not ever get an image worth of processing.  I've uninstalled it, but I haven't figured out how to get it out of my Amazon.com apps list.
B004RF2KAC|1.0|This album stinks, I'm disappointed in Jennifer Hudson. She has such a beautiful voice, and I was hoping to hear better than what I did. This album is full of borderline pop genre filler tracks, and to me I feel that this project was rushed. The lead single Where You At is mediocre at best, and I can't believe there wasn't a song similar to I'm His Only Woman. I don't think she has to release an album full of slow ballads but seriously, if you have a powerful and beautiful voice why hide it? This album is in the same category as Christina Aguilera's Bionic, Brandy's Human, Ciara's Basic Instinct, and that is not a good thing at all.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Will not install on my Droid X. Click on install and installation begins for about 2 seconds then says 'not installed' This does not make me happy.
B002JIEYLW|3.0|This album has been a part of my Black Sabbath collection since 1975, when I was first introduced to and became a fan of their music. Having had to replace my albums numerous times during the years of transition from vinyl to mp3, I long hesitated to purchased a remastered edition. A remastered edition of Vol. 4 is definitely needed, but this is not that edition. The sound quality on the original recording of \\"Wheels of Confusion,\\" \\"Supernaut,\\" and \\"Snowblind\\" is actually superior to that which is offered on this remastered album. The only tract that I can confidently say is improved in sound is \\"Laguna Sunrise.\\"
0440241901|4.0|I recently went on spring break and wanted something light and entertaining to read. Can You Keep a Secret definitely fit the bill! It was cute, funny, and engaging. You could tell what was going to happen as the story unfolded, but this isn't a murder mystery novel. Overall, a great easy read.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|why wouldn't you download this app. its a $5 app that they are giving away. even if there is a better one, it's a friggin giveaway. i never had a problem with shazam lite and now I've got the full version
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have to say that this seris of books was wonderful. The first book was hard to get into, but once I passed page 67 (yes I know that actual page number) I could not put the book down. The other two followed suit. I am so sad that Mr. Larsson died because in Lizbeth he had a character that he could have written more about and the readers would continue to love her!
B002ZG99QS|4.0|I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I loved the original but I have gotten to a point where almost all movies dissapoint me. However, this movie was very well done, the acting was serious, not korny. The visual effects were great, but not to a point that they overwhelm the story, nor does the movie rely on special effects. I thought toward the end it was going to be one of those I must do anything for this girl I so desperate love, but thankfully it didn't turn into one of those cheesey moments.<br /><br />I guess another thing that topped it off for me was that I was super proud of myself for spotting Daft Punk in the DJ booth in the club scene. Funny thing is they didn't even need costumes for this movie, they basically just wore there everyday attire ~_~<br /><br />Yay! Daft Punk, the best thing France ever produced.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know these books were focused for the teenager to young adult, but I just loved this book. When you first read the premise of what the book is about you may want to turn away, but don't! It is a story that catches hold of you and you don't want to let go! I finished the last two books in one week and I am \\"hungry\\" for more.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this app is awesome on my rooted nook color running cyanogen mod 7 . +1 A+ don't know what else to say just need my stupid 25 word min :)
0823095223|4.0|I'm a lapsed sculptor (preferred medium of wax), and found this book a strong, and informative  guide to bring me back. Excellent illustrations, salient points by guest contributors, wonderful photos and instructions that follow two projects for completion. That said, I would to like to have seen a bit more on the second, Thor figure, and it's joints (something that's completely new to me). That said, I think this is a fantastic book, and the blog is an excellent complement. Check it out!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This app is entirely impressive. I'm going to give it a full 5 stars. I had an 80's station on and tried a number of songs. The third song I tried was not recognized. I tried it several different times in several different ways but it just couldn't get it. In it's defence though it's an obsure 80's hit called 'Object of my Desire' by Starpoint. So it's not infallible but impressive nonetheless.
B003UESJH4|5.0|After viewing this film I was moved to tears as well as wanting to cheer and sing \\"God Save the King!!\\"  The cast is marvelous, the story great and England ended up with the right king at the right time...shudder to think how things would have turned out with Edward on the throne during the war!!
B004DN3VEM|4.0|It's great that some of these record labels are finally understanding that there is more to the market than only the youger demographic. Releases like this are of real value to fans and collectors who in some cases are now in their late 40's and beyond!<br /><br />Rainbow did not do much in the way of \\"extra\\" material when recording. They usually had just enough for the album. Who knows..Maybe Blackmore has all kinds of demos in his vaults that pertain to this album and he just doesn't feel compelled to release them? We just don't know. (None of the surviving members of Rainbow have ever indicated that such things exist.) But for those of us who understand how unusual it is to get this kind of material on Ritchie, it is a real treasure! One look at the liner notes confirms that he has involvement in these re-issues.<br /><br />I remember asking Jimmy Bain once why the bass sound was so weak on \\"Rising\\" and he said the record company rejected it as being too-bassy and it was subsequently remixed with less bass end. If this is accurate perhaps this is part of why two mixes are available here. So, without knowing it I apparently grew up on what is called  the \\"New York Mix\\" . After listening to this new Deluxe Version though, I now prefer the \\"Los Angeles Mix\\". I can finally hear the bass guitar! There are also some other minor nuances that I noticed on headphones in the way the intros were mixed too. The \\"Rough Mixes\\" while clearly noisey (with tape hiss) are VERY interesting as well! One cannot help but realize how incredible Dio was! You hear him with hardly any effects on the rough mixes and it's just absurd how great he is.<br /><br />Another observation is that Tony Carey is also incredible. The sounds he achieved were perfect for this album. He had a way of fitting in sonically that was not matched by any other Rainbow keyboard players. (Rainbow had some great keyboardists over the years too) Carey's intros and solos, especially \\"Light in the Black\\" are just incredible! The \\"Rough mixes\\" render the mids and low ends of the guitar more as well.<br /><br />As far as the Stargazer rehearsal bonus track goes, I think it would have been smarter to include Stargazer from the incredible (and expensive) live import CD's that many Rainbow fans do not have, as this bonus track is useless due to the poor quality.<br /><br />(Link to Rainbow live Nurnberg 1976.) [...]<br /><br />I wish someone could have located a live version of \\"A light in the Black\\" or they could have included something other than the poor \\"rehearsal\\" version. The booklet is good and had a few tid -bits that I wasn't aware of. (How the drums were recorded for example) The pictures were fair (kind of blurry) and could have been better, but that's not the priority for me. (The inner gatefold sleeve photo of the full band from the original album is not duplicated here either)<br /><br /> The only thing that would have me buying this album again would be if it went to 5.1. Assuming they had someone really knowledgeable with the process at the helm such as what is occurring with the King Crimson catalog. I am not nostalgic when it comes to music. Music, unlike some other art forms, will always be fluid so long as the multitracks still exist. I do not see this as \\"tampering\\" with any classic because the original mix is here and it sounds great. I embrace any chance to hear a remix or alternate mix so long as the artists is involved or has approved of it. The remastering is very good as the album was produced well. (One can only imagine what an album like this could have sounded like with todays recording technology) The differences in the mixes are not drastic. They are significant to the discerning ear though. I have no doubts there will be people who will not be able to hear the differences. It's a loney world I guess :)<br /><br />It will take many listens to quantify and qualify these multiple versions. My first reaction is that the \\"LA Mix\\" and the \\"Rough Mixes\\" arethe gems of this release. Oh and yes, the Rough Mixes have the extended keyboard intros on Stargazer too! They also have some longer fades as well! So, with that perspective is getting THREE mixes of one of Rainbow's best works worth it? In my opinion it is. If you are a casual fan or someone who doesnt appreciate the subtlties of remastering, or the art/science of remixing than perhaps not.<br /><br />Update:<br />From the DEEP PURPLE APPRECIATION SOCIETY and from JERRY BLOOM who was from MORE BLACK THAN PURPLE and involved with this deluxe cd edition. He writes......<br />\\"To clarify it for anyone who is interested, when the album was originally released on CD in the 80s a mix was done in LA but rejected at the time and a new mix done in NY. As I was involved in the project with Universal I suggested they included the LA mix, which had leaked out on the Japanese release and in my opinion was better than any previous mix. It includes a lengthier intro to Tarot Woman and bass and backing vocals are more prominent.\\"<br /><br />*****New update from the man who worked on this release and for those who \\"think\\" there is more in the archives or on the tapes:<br /><br />\\"Nothing could be found in Universal's archive. It's possible that tapes of outtakes may languish somewhere, but they haven't materialised yet. We do know there was an alternative keyboard solo by Carey for A Light In The Black but whether it was kept I have no idea.I'm sure that many people might be disappointed by no outtakes, but the major point I tried to get across in the sleeve notes was how quickly the album was done, as it had all been rehearsed beforehand, whereas DTE (and Long Live Rock 'n' Roll of course) was a different matter all together.\\" (Jerry Bloom)

1601251505|4.0|4th printing review (updating printing versions available on [...]):<br /><br />If you ever wanted to keep playing 3.5 and and forget 4.0, this system is for you.  Continuing it's open resource commitment, the pathfinder community is very active and innovative in player experiences.  This is something you can google \\"pathfinder prd\\" for and get the rules to play!  Much like 3.5 was with SRD.<br /><br />All eleven classes are improved, especially the barbarian, paladin, and sorcerer.  The druid and ranger classes were largely untouched, as they are broken enough.  XP seems to be difficult to scale, as there are 3 different scales for the GM to choose from.  But this is depending on the GM and the speed of the sessions - so it's all relative.<br /><br />Some combat maneuvers are simplified, and spells are balanced.  Being able to trip and immediately attack takes more feats and alter self is nerfed - however if you knew how to break them in 3.5 you now respect the changes in pathfinder.<br /><br />The books as all you need, except monsters, in one book of over 500 pages!  There is no GM book needed to play, and since both pathfinder(prd) and 3.5(srd) are both open source, you can look up monsters and incorporate them in your sessions!<br /><br />I'm a fan of supporting good work, and I believe you should have at least one book to play a system.  With that being said, I would say that the only reason this didn't get 5 stars is the binding.  It seems like it isn't as strong as I would hope.  But with all the information available online, it's still worth it.<br /><br />You can go to the paizo publishing website and get the prd versions of all the books - even subscribe!<br /><br />All in all, paizo did a fabulous job keeping 3.5 alive.  It's known now as 3.75, a respectable edition for those wanting to play a role-playing game without throwing the baby out with the bath water.  In 4.0, every class is a \\"sorcerer\\" and you can using a lot of your abilities outside of combat, eh?  Wizards vastly changed Dnd to sell product.  Don't follow down the 4.0 path because it will just lead to you 5,6,7.0, etc...  Stick with what works, pathfinder, period and you'll be a wealthier player for it.[[ASIN:1601251505 Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Core Rulebook]]n't follow down the 4.0 path because it will just lead to you 5,6,7.0, etc...

1427211760|5.0|I had the privelage of seeing Ben live as he presented many of these concepts to a group of executives.  The impact was amazing.  This CD is the next best thing to seeing him live.  Hearing Ben and Rose present these concepts in there own empassioned way was great.  I really like listening to the CD's in my car periodically as a way of pulling me out of old entrenched ways of thinking and getting me to more cosistently stay out of \\"downward spiral\\" behaviors.

0399250573|5.0|While I have always enjoyed the Alex Rider adventures, i felt that they had peaked with Scorpia, the remarkable fifth book in the series, and the one that convinced me that Anthony Horowitz really meant business. The last three books, while enjoyable, seemed to be coasting a bit, efficiently tell a rollicking good story, but not much more. Scorpia Rising is the final book in Alex Rider's story we're told, and Horowitz really outdoes himself, creating a dark tale that will really throw readers for a loop. He takes his time getting there, we don't even meet Alex until a third of the way through the story, but once he has the dominoes set up he wastes no time in knocking them all down. The last third of the story is both a fast-moving action adventure, but also an emotional sock in the jaw. It's not quite the happy ending you may have hoped for. Horowitz seldom pulls his punches and never does here. This is a dark, brutal book. I loved it.
0525423273|5.0|The first word that comes to my mind when I think about Anna and the French Kiss is \\"adorable\\"! I loved the magical setting of Paris and the wonderful characters that surround Anna as she embarks on this new journey at an unfamiliar boarding school. Soon one of Anna's new friends, St. Claire, *swoon* becomes her brand new crush.<br /><br />Anna is one of those characters that you can't help but laugh at...because she reminds you so much of yourself! Anna seemed just as neurotic as I was during high school. Like when you think your crush is staring at you and you think \\"OMG, is he really staring at me? What if he is and he likes me? No, I probably just have something on my face. Crap, do I really have something on my face? How do I get it off without him noticing? Oh no, this is so embarrassing!\\" Kinda like that. I think that's why I loved reading about Anna so much. She was such a funny character and so easy to relate to.<br /><br />St. Claire is just dreamy. He wasn't perfect but he had that magnetic personality. His romance with Anna wasn't automatic (as romances tend to be in some books). They were friends long before anything happened. On that same note, it was easy to see why they were friends. They truly had a strong bond and were able to let loose and have fun.<br /><br />Stephanie flawlessly added additional characters into the plot without them seeming out of place or just empty characters to take up space. Anna's new friends Meredith, Josh, and Rashmi all help complete their tight circle. I was completely immersed into their day to day lives and challenges. Plus, the addition of a magical Paris setting is hard to resist. I enjoyed reading about the visiting of landmarks and crazy adventures Anna had while exploring her new home.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss lives up to the high expectations I had for the story. The quirky characters, twisting plot, and hilarious dialogue made this a book impossible for me to put down. I look forward to reading more stories by Stephanie Perkins.
B0043RT8JU|5.0|Paper Towns is a life changing book that everyone over the age of thirteen should read. It is the kind of book that, like a fine meal, makes you savor it, makes you think about it. Why teenagers are reading books like \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\" in school alludes me, for John Green's Paper Towns is a modern day classic filled with humor, romance, mystery, symbolism, and a thoughtful determination that draws teenagers in like flies, and being one myself, I know.
0061726826|5.0|Wow. This is one of those books that you finish reading and have to take time to wrap your mind around what just happened. \\"Love\\" is a word people throw around often, but what if you couldn't? What if it was against the rules to love another person? That scenario is what Delirium brings to light. In this world, where love is forbidden, Lena is waiting for her turn to be cured of the disease that took her mother. The disease is Amor deliria nervosa and it's deadly.<br /><br />Love has been found to be a terrible disease that must be eradicated. 17 year-old Lena can't wait till the day she has the procedure that will keep her from getting the disease. It happens when each individual is 18, and her time is coming fast. But first, everyone must be evaluated. After the procedure they will be matched with their future husband or wife and this test is highly important for your future. Lena wants to do the best she can and give the evaluators the answers they are looking for. Then chaos occurs when some cows go loose in the labs and Lena comes face to face with the boy that will change her idea of love.<br /><br />Alex has a complicated past that Lena doesn't discover until later but all she knows is that she can't keep him off of her mind. She keeps a check on the symptoms, to see if she is infected, but over time she realizes she may not care if she is. Alex is irresistible in the best possible ways. He opens a new world of possibilities for Lena and shows her that things may not be as they seem. Maybe being cured isn't an easy way out. Maybe having a life clearly laid out for you won't make you happy. These are things Lena had never considered before.<br /><br />I also have to mention Lena's best friend, Hanna. Hanna was originally the one who helped Lena see another side of society. She questioned being cured and went to parties where boys and girls could dance and touch. All of that was forbidden, and Lena was shocked to see these things. Hanna helped complete Lena. Without Hanna's friendship, I don't think that Lena would have been as strong as she was. They had a complex bond that best friends should have. I never questioned their interactions. I could see why they were friends and why they were so supportive of each other.<br /><br />Alex and Lena's relationship was based on something much deeper than typical teenage romance. It was build on respect, compassion, and desire. They were aware of the forbidden aspects and took several dangerous steps in order to stay together. Simply stated, it was perfectly crafted! It felt real and I never questioned where the love came from.<br /><br />Lauren has created a breathtaking story that will have readers emotionally invested in these characters as they watch them fight for the right to feel. Delirium is moving, stunning, exceptionally written, and more emotion-packed than I could have ever imagined. Lauren's writing is nothing short of eloquent, and the personality of each character bounds off the page and into your heart. In a world where love is forbidden, Delirium brings more love and passion than I could have imagined.hip, I don't think that Lena would have been as strong as she was.

B004EPYZU8|3.0|Zack Snyder just hasn't made the same impact on me that he apparently has on the rest of the moviegoing population. I enjoy his work, but it always seems like there's something to be desired when his films finally fade to black. With Sucker Punch, Snyder isn't really looking to change the formula his films have become notorious for, but the storyline just didn't sit right with me. We know ahead of time that this is all taking place in Baby Doll's head? That's like knowing ahead of time that Teddy Daniels is patient 67 in Shutter Island. Oh wait, we kind of did and that still turned out pretty great. Sucker Punch is fairly disappointing on one hand, but mostly just incredibly entertaining on the other.<br /><br />The Zack Snyder formula mentioned usually just involves heavy use of slow motion while most of his films have a particular look to them like they're all sent through the same filter before reaching the screen while also feeling like they all taking place in the same universe. Snyder became notorious for his R-Rated films, but then broke that mold with Legend of the Guardians. Sucker Punch is Snyder's first PG-13 film, so don't expect a lot of gratuitous gore, endless strings of profanity or graphic sex scenes on spaceships that last an incredibly long time since there's none of that. If you're a fan of any of Snyder's work, Sucker Punch still hits all the same buttons that films like 300 and Watchmen did; the action sequences are still insane and the slow motion technique is used in a way that adds a bit of gusto to each scene it's used in. When the girls first arrive on the train and they're in the middle of trying to retrieve a kitchen knife, a gun is fired as we see the bullet bounce off and shatter a robot's head. The shell then flies by the screen as we hear the air in the room howl through the shell before it falls to the ground. So if you're a doubter of the PG-13 rating, it doesn't really affect much here.<br /><br />This film is like a man's action movie fantasy. It's like Sucker Punch tries to roll everything a guy would enjoy in a film like hot women, heavy gunfire, a mother dragon who basically makes explosions come to her, and enough insanity injected into its most adrenaline racing scenes to keep you talking around the water cooler for hours. It's like trying to combine Showgirls, the Dawn of the Dead remake, Dead Snow, The Lord of the Rings, and I, Robot into one movie. During that same train sequence, I could've sworn the score suddenly paid homage to Terminator 2. Sucker Punch makes sure to tickle all of the brain cells in your head that are still attached to action films from your past.<br /><br />While the film's charm mostly comes from its action scenes and the films they pay tribute to, the flaws in Sucker Punch aren't exactly minimal. The main one being that the film's constant use of music with vocals makes Sucker Punch feel like the director's cut of an extended music video. There are three songs used practically in full in the first thirty to forty five minutes of the film among countless others as the film progresses. The film also takes place within two layers of the mind in addition to what's actually happening in reality, which makes the film feel like a less complicated version of Inception. The plan that Baby Doll comes up with seems a little too grandiose for its own good with such little payoff at times. Do you really have to dance to go to another reality where you're fighting robots on a train while trying to disarm a bomb before it explodes all for nothing more than a kitchen knife? It honestly just felt like a group of guys got together and threw all their favorite action movies into a pot and created a film with an amazing looking incoherent film before coming back around and adding a story to it to try and make everything have some sort of meaning.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Sucker Punch is basically just a glorified music video with really spectacular eye candy. The film can also be considered a fanboy's wet dream. If you're a guy, Sucker Punch is practically guaranteed to at least touch upon at least one of the things you look for and love in an action film. Whether it's giant samurai warriors wielding Gatling guns, steam powered zombie soldiers, hideous orcs and fire breathing dragons, an overbearing clan of bloodthirsty robots, or the fact that you just like to watch scantily clad, young women annihilate their enemies with nothing more than a blade and an endless supply of bullets, Zack Snyder's latest probably has you covered. Sucker Punch may not be the best written film of the year, but it's an action film that can still be considered a hell of a lot of brainless fun.wet dream.

1450400957|5.0|All too often we do our workouts without a thought to the muscles we're working.  That's a major mistake. I like to plan each workout around the muscles I want to work. I want to know how much weight I need to devote to each muscle group and why. That's where this book comes in.<br /><br />For example, last night I planned today's workout using this book. I wanted to work the compound muscle groups of the upper body and also hit the triceps and biceps. So I looked in the book.<br /><br />First, let's take a look at the contents and how the book is laid out.<br /><br />Part I: Develop Your Bodybuilding Program<br /><br />Equipment<br />Diversify Resistance for Maximum Effectiveness<br />How a Muscle Gains Strength<br />Mechanisms of Muscle Enlargement<br />How Muscles Increase Their Endurance<br />Contraindications to Bodybuilding<br />Clearly Define Your Objectives<br />Quantify Your Objectives<br />20 Steps to Developing Your Program<br />Rates of Progress<br />Role of Diet<br />Warm-Up Techniques<br />Cool-Down (Return to Calm)<br />Keep a Workout Notebook<br />Analyze Your Workouts<br />Using Video<br />Techniques for Increasing Intensity<br />Inroad Theory<br />Theory of Absolute Strength<br />Train to Muscle Failure?<br />Beyond Failure<br />Cheat Repetitions<br />Forced Repetitions<br />Tapering<br />Rest Break<br />Negatives<br />Stop-and-Go<br />Burn....<br />Continuous Tension<br />Unilateral Training<br />Supersets<br />Circuits<br />How Should You Breathe While Exercising?<br /><br />Part II: Exercises<br /><br />Strengthen Your Arms<br />Bigger Shoulders<br />Sculpt Your Chest<br />Strengthen Your Neck<br />Sculpt Your Back<br />Strengthen Your Thighs<br />Strengthen Your Legs<br />Firm Up Your Glutes<br />Flexibility in the Rotator Muscles of the Hip<br />Sculpt Your Core<br />Exercises for the Diaphragm and Respiratory Muscles<br /><br />Part III: Programming<br /><br />1. Men's Strength<br />2. Women's Strength<br />3. Sport-Specific Training<br /><br />Now, I have to tell you, that's a lot to get into a 256 page book.<br /><br />Let's say you want to work out your legs. You turn to the section with the blue edges. These are the workout pages and they're divided into sections for each part of the body.<br /><br />You'll see the anatomy of the entire body and the parts that each exercise works. You simply plan your workout based on that information.<br /><br />But, there's more.<br /><br />You get helpful hints. For example, \\"When the lumbar muscles get tired, it becomes more and more difficult to maintain the slight natural arch of the back. The spine will start to curve. In this case, reduce the range of motion so that you can always keep your back straight and maintain muscular tension in the hamstrings.\\"<br /><br />You'll also notice there are advantages and disadvantages to each exercise. Moreover, you're given the option to use free weights, bodyweight or strength bands. Notice I didn't say anything about gym equipment?<br /><br />That's because the author has rightly made it known that you can get a great workout right at home. No gym required.<br /><br />\\"Gyms emphasize the fun aspects of exercising and do not focus on effectiveness,\\" the author Frederic Delavier explains. \\"This is why gyms often choose equipment that looks nice over equipment that works well.\\"<br /><br />Delavier believes you should use a combination of bodyweight, strength bands and free weights. While I don't agree with everything he says, I understand his reasoning.<br /><br />I love the way the book tells the reader how to work out, how to breath while exercising and all the really important fundamentals of working out.<br /><br />Few people, including most experts, agree on working out to failure. The author gives us reasons why it's good and why it's not. More importantly, he tells us when it will help and when it could hurt.<br /><br />He says that in terms of inroading (tiring the muscle), stopping before failure causes a weak inroad. Pushing to failure causes a noticeable inroad and going beyond failure causes a serious inroad.<br /><br />He also discusses cheat reps --- \\"When you reach failure, this does not mean the muscle has no strength left. It just does not have enough to lift the weight you are using anymore.\\"<br /><br />This is an excellent workout book. Delavier always delivers and he has outdone himself with this book. While it's directed at athletes, the book is really for anyone who works out and wants to do it right and to understand what effect each exercise has on the muscles.<br /><br />And, as in my case, it's a great tool in planning your workouts.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />-- Susanna K.

B0043RT8JU|4.0|John Green captures Quentin's last weeks of high school and portrays them with a tantalizing mix of mystery, humor, adventure, and a twinge of love.     As an avid reader, I have indulged in my fair share of books from Speak, a decently recent imprint launched by Puffin Books. With that being said, this is my first experience in dabbling in John Green's novels and I must say, this man can tell a story.     \\"Paper Towns\\" is a more than a tale of finding yourself in a sea of high school students; it's the unraveling of the unknown, a thought-provoking story with humor and friendship. The plot is divided up into three sections: The Strings, The Grass, and The Vessel. Each section has a different driving force to hold your interest. These sections flow through the childhood and high school of Quentin and Margo. Q is on a mission: to find Margo Roth Spiegelman, but before he can find her there is so much more he must understand about Margo, others, and himself.    The strengths of this story include certain characters, the style, and the allusions to other pieces of literature. Specific characters, such as Radar, are charismatic, quirky, and spot on. On several occasions, during reading the novel, I laughed out loud and often had a smirk on my face due to the humorous bantering between friends. These characters make \\"Paper Towns\\" memorable creating a realistic depiction of Q's life.  The layout of the story is well schemed, with-holding enough to keep you reading yet revealing enough that you don't feel the need to skip ahead. The detail and descriptive imagery could not be better. This story is not an airy read; its topics are deep and show Q's thoughts as his world and understanding shift beneath his feet. The intertwining of the poetry of Whitman adds another level of metaphoric beauty to the writing.    The downfalls include other two-dimensional characters and the ending. (This is NOT a spoiler!) Although certain characters did stand out with pitch-perfect voice, others fell into the background due to their cliché personalities. In some sense, maybe Green did this purposefully so they would fit the idea of \\"paper people\\", but I often found myself grasping at straws to connect to Q's seemingly perfect parents, popular and pretty Lacey, and sometimes even the estranged Margo.  As for the ending, although it did not in any way ruin the story, it fell short of my expectations. I feel that a story with such a well-crafted plot, spot-on dialogue, and stimulating ideas should have a stronger ending.     This story should be for young adults; ages 15 and up due to the dealings with death, vandalism, sexual behavior and inappropriate language. It is not for you if you are easily offended by this type of humor. It is also not for you if you want a light, fun-only type of read.     I recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in a little bit of adventure, mystery, and deeply moving insight. John Green's ability to illuminate characters and situations on a surface and deeper level will lead me to read more of his novels.

Its obviously a knock-off because they tried to use all the same colours, etc., but could not go as far as also using the same logo. That really is terrible!    I tried to submit a refund request, but got the message that this requires special handling, so I had to contact Amazon outside of the typical refund process to request a refund.

B002HWBS96|4.0|The staging for this Festspiele Baden-Baden production, directed by Herbert Wernicke and conducted by Christian Thielemann, is as sumptuous as Richard Strauss's score and, surrounded by mirrors that amplify the stage, it's as languidly self-reflective as Hugo von Hofmannsthal's original libretto. The choice not to stage it as strictly period in the setting of Marie-Therese's Vienna around 1740 is somewhat contrary to the composers' desire to recreate a sense of the light indulgence of the period (and in the process break away from the dark dissonance of Strauss's previous operas Salome and Elektra), but the libretto and score are, in most sections, strong enough on their own, and so well thematically constructed that Der Rosenkavalier can stand up to a modern, or, in this case, an almost fairy-tale pantomime-like setting.     There is a richness of means by which to enjoy Strauss's most popular opera, which flits from moment to moment, slipping from happiness into despair, from love into comedy, but principally, it is indeed about being in the moment, living in the moment, but that even within the moment there are many contradictory thoughts and emotions pulling at one. All this is contained within the playful storyline and within the music that underscores it. Like all Strauss's work, Der Rosenkavalier takes the language of post-Wagner late-Romanticism opera another stage further into modernity, not just accompanying the voice, not just heightening the emotional tone of the drama or just using leitmotifs to form a musical coherency and symbolism, but presenting the phrasing with an infinite number of meanings and inflections, hinting at deeper underlying psychology and richness of character, living in the moment and crystallising it in melody, but with a deeper consideration for the personality of the characters and particularly in the intricate web that is created through human interaction.     Consequently, nothing is straightforward in Der Rosenkavalier. Straussis fully aware of the buffa conventions he is playing with, all of which are complementary to the period in opera terms - not least in the Cherubino-style cross-dressing of a travesti female singer playing a male character who dresses up as a female - and he approaches the scoring of the farce with no less detail and underlying thoughtfulness than anywhere else, knowing that - as Ariadne auf Naxos made explicit - that the strength of the work is in how the diparate elements work off each other. Personally, I feel that it's often rather too clever for its own good and, like much of Strauss's work, it's rather distanced, controlled and too precise - much like Thielemann's conducting of the Munich Philharmonic - allowing in little real human feeling or ambiguity, creating a perfect semblance of life like the crystallised silver rose that this production rather ambitiously replaces with a real one at the end.     A sympathetic presentation can nonetheless do wonders with the work, but I'm not entirely convinced by Herbert Wernicke's production, created for Salzburg and played here at the Festspiele Baden-Baden in 2009 with the Munich Philharmonic under Thielemann, but it does at least create a productive environment for the singers. The 1962 film version of Der Rosenkavalier starring Elisabeth Swharzkopf casts a long shadow over the work, but no opera work should ever be considered definitive. Every one of the main performers here - an exceptional cast that includes some beautiful singing and subtle acting from the wonderful, self-possessed and appropriately regal Renée Fleming as the Marschallin, with impressive touches also from Sophie Koch, Diana Damrau and Jonas Kaufmann - brings something interesting to their characters, as does the always interesting Thielemann when interpreting Strauss.    The Blu-ray edition from Decca/Unitel Classica looks and sounds marvellous, the performance directed for the screen by the ever reliable Brian Large. Audio tracks are the usual LPCM stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1. Subtitles are English, French, German, Spanish and Chinese. The Blu-ray also contains a 32 minute look at the opera from the perspective of the conductor and the main singers, who all provide interesting views on the piece, and a booklet with synopsis and a superb essay on the opera by Bryan Gilmore.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I'm a serious fantasy reader, and I'm also seriously choosy about writers and stories--I have a hard time wading through the pounds of fluff that gets published in the genre, sifting past junk to find \\"the good stuff.\\"  I picked this book up shortly after it came out with the thought that \\"hm, it sounds like it might be okay, I'll give it a go...\\"  And I ended up deciding it was the best fantasy novel I had read in *years*.  Rothfuss plays with the tropes and themes of fantasy and delivers a wonderful beginning to what I hope will be a long series.  I *highly* recommend this book for any fan of epic fantasy.
B003PMUWJE|1.0|Ordered an unabridged audio book and got a used hard bound book instead.  I wanted to exchange it for the audio book, but only was able to return for refund.  Would still like to have the audio book, but I'm afraid to order it again.
0439023521|3.0|I probably would never have read \\"The Hunger Games\\", except 2 female friends (both 30yr+ soccer-mom types) gushingly poured accolades all over the story and one lent me her copy.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is not a waste of time.<br />The \\"arena\\" action (Chapters 11 through 25) is a fun read and does seem to have that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" child-versus-child violence and machinations.  With fleshed-out dialog, those chapters could easily hold-up as a short-story or novella.<br /><br />However, my stumbling block with \\"The Hunger Games\\" is the rest of it, chapters 1-10 and 26-27.  Which includes that anti-climactic, rushed, non-flavored ending.<br /><br />Maybe more is revealed about the Capitol culture, psychology, and economics in the sequels, BUT AS A STAND-ALONE STORY I couldn't \\"buy-in\\" to why this advanced government (with hovercraft, night-vision glasses, sky projections, genetically-altered wasps and wolves, etc.) and their affluent populace (living in sartorial and couture splendor, with skyscrapers shining at night as if it were a summer's day, rapid transit, and food and medicine for all) would (after 74 years) continue to tolerate the gratuitous murder of 12 year-old children.<br /><br />Tolerating the ritualistic murder of children would only make sense if the Capitol government and its citizens were:<br />1) unsophisticated and despotic (like warlords in Sierra Leone or Somalia, which force children to be soldiers and assassins); and/or,<br />2) truly abhorred and disgusted by the traitorous District citizens.<br />But even though The Hunger Games were created after insurrection and war (to punish and remind the Districts of their treason), and even though the District citizens are subjected to public whippings and spot executions, the Capitol citizens don't seem to be too sickened with these \\"traitors\\".  Quite the contrary, the Capitol seems to spare no expense when lavishing luxuries, food, parades, and interviews on these \\"tributes\\", treating them like A-list celebrities and rock-stars.  Rome (much less Somalia and Sierra Leone) didn't even come close to treating it's conquered slaves-who-became-gladiators to this much front-end comfort and indulgence.  Not economical, and not reasonable.<br /><br />The story is written in linear, first-person narrative.  So, I don't think anyone should be surprised or spoiled in guessing whose perspective will be the final and living perspective.  Although, (SPOILER FOLLOWS), the story could (or maybe should) have ended by Katniss actually eating the poison berries (with or without Peeta), and dying as a martyr.  Unfortunately, it would have ended just as if \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" had been told from Juliet's perspective and we could then never learn (like \\"Romeo and Juliet\\") that \\"The Hunger Games\\" could (and should) indeed be a cautionary tale.  We could never learn that it was the characters' martyrdom that compelled the Capitol (like the Capulets and Montagues) to end the irrational and uncivilized Hunger Games and to start governing it's District citizens with civility.  Instead, \\"The Hunger Games\\" has a contrived and weak ending.<br /><br />Of course, that would require the author to be more pragmatic and add more depth, fleshing-out the cardboard supporting cast, the Capitol's politics and sociology, and even some detail as to the arena's mechanics.<br />How the parachutes are delivered with such precision, how the weather is changed (Katniss seems to think they can change the weather), the infinite network of cameras and microphones, etc.<br />\\"How do you think Haymitch did it?\\"... \\"He outsmarted them.\\"  Really?  That's all we get of Haymitch's Hunger Games?  You still know nothing about his Hunger Games strategy and survival... the mini-story of his own morality.  He's made out to be the bumbling, town drunk, but NOT the post-traumatic syndrome drunk, the \\"yes, after all these years it's the Hunger Games that is killing me\\" drunk.  What a waste of an essential character that could reveal the nature and brutality of the games through profound dialog and edgy character interaction.  Instead the author chooses uninspriing, one-dimensional, one paragraph narrative, buried in the monotony.<br />And maybe things do get fleshed-out in the sequels, but... again... as a stand-alone story, \\"The Hunger Games\\" falls short in that respect.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think this type of all-inclusive exposition is a bit outside the author's scope or ability, and therein lies the difference between a teen-novel and adult literary fiction.<br /><br />If you are an adult, and a science-fiction fan like myself, and looking for the depth and exposition of contemporary authors like Stephen Baxter, Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card, etc... you will not find it in \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br />Or, if you are a looking for the nuance and post-apocalyptic poetic darkness of something like McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" or Atwood's dystopian classic \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\"... sorry, also not in \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />So, from now on, everytime I see and hear 30+ year-old adults pour accolades on young-adult fiction, I will feel like the Danny Glover character in the Lethal Weapon movie series, \\"I'm too old for this $....!\\"<br /><br />Thank yourofound dialog and edgy character interaction.

B004SBS8LA|2.0|Worked great the first couple days, and yes this was a great upgrade from angry birds, definitely exceeded my expectations.   Then, today I try to open it, the screen goes black and then I'm back at my home screen. Same results no matter how many times I try. So I reboot my phone, and now when I try to start it, I get a forever-black screen until the Force Close dialog comes up. I'm on a Droid.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is by far and away better than the original, it runs faster, smoother, better graphics and nice new backgrounds. runs great on my EVO
1597801577|4.0|As entitled, this seems to be a strange story which revolves around calorie companies, woefully inadequate power supplies, hot weather, strange fruits, and an artificial female.  I really wanted to like the Windup Girl character, but she was never fully explained to my satisfaction.  I wasn't sure if she were a victim or a power in the making.  There were a number of characters I started to enjoy, but I always felt they were not fully developed.  I purchased this book after reading The Ship Breakers, but felt oddly cheated by this book.  Possibly, the story was a little too esoteric for me.  When I read the last page, I just felt sort of dissatisfied with the story.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I am always a little hesitant to start a Picoult because of the amount you must immerse yourself in the book. Here is a story that takes in issues of the here and now of today. The story line was topical and if not just a smidgen predictable. The story ended in a not typical Picoult fashion (thankgoodness) - my only grievance was no audio with my kindle version. I think purchasers should be provided with a link to download the selection if we wished to listen. Beautifully written and one of those 'wish it didnt end' books.
B001AQT0OU|2.0|Oh, C'mon! We don't deserve this. We don't need a simple transfer for BD. Barry Lyndon is one of of the few films you really feel experiencing being in the past. There must be lots of material of the production and design of the film. This is THE Stanley Kubrick film that deserves the better treatment. A TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION! DVD or BD.<br />I think I am speaking for the whole Kubrick's Lot.
0307477479|5.0|Every five books or so i get one I can't get enough of. This was one of those. The storytelling was unique and superb. I loved the way each chapter was a different character who carried the story forward or back in some way. Even though there's no plot, somehow she kept me reading wondering who I was going to meet next. Jennifer Egan is amazing.

B004DWKO8Y|5.0|The wait was worth it...Mr Big's 7th studio album What If was released this year.  Since hearing Mr Big were going to re-unite, and seeing the Undertow video I knew Mr Big fan's were in for some quality tunes and bang-up musicianship!  Often `reunion' albums are met with hype, bells and whistles while the final product is met with less then stellar results, only put out to full a contract/promote a cash-cow tour.<br /><br />This is not the case with `What If'.  Of the 11 blistering tracks on this gem, there is not one clunker.  Starting with the 1st single/video Undertow.  The slower songs on the album,  `Stranger In My Life' and `All The Way Up' show amazing lyrics mixed with emotion.  Stranger In My Life makes it easy to picture a soldier Eric is discussing and his story.<br /><br />Kevin `Caveman' Shirley does an amazing job on this album with the production, making all the songs sound great on a stereo cranked to 11!<br /><br />As expected on a Mr Big album, the musicianship is strong and leaves the listener amazed.  To me What If is Billy Sheehan's most powerful bass playing on a Mr.Big album!<br /><br />Japan edition has the track `Kill Me With A Kiss' as the bonus track while Europe and ITunes get the track Unforgiven.  Both are solid tunes.<br /><br />If you have ever liked Mr.Big check out What If, their heaviest to date......you won't be disappointed!
1427210497|2.0|Jonathan Frantzen is supposed to be an excellent writer. But this book, which is the result of nine years work (unless he trashed a few others in between) could have used a few more editors.  What bothers me the most is that he seems to want us to dislike his characters and does little to make them interesting.  Yes disagreeable people can be interesting - just look at Gregory House, MD and Charlie Sheen.  But there has to something more to them than that they are living a miserable life.  It seemed to me that Frantzen just threw as many words on paper that he could come up with and then left it to the rest of us to make something coherent out of it.    (sung to the tune of \\"The Brady Bunch\\") This is the story of Walter and Patty who were bringing up two stereo- typical kids.  His name is Joey, her name is Jessica and they have problems of their own.  Add to the mixture, their old friend Richard, who was going to be a rock'n'roll star.  STOP here if you know whats good for you.  If the characters were anymore two-dimensional, you could fold them into cardboard boxes.    Having read many of the other reviews, it seems amazing that anyone thought that this was a good book.  Of the eight hundred or so reviews, 250 gave it only one star, what does that tell you.  Having made it through the book I was a whiny as the characters and felt like ripping off my shirt (like the Hulk) just for the hell of it.  This wouldn't make a good reunion show for \\"Dallas\\" or a good episode of \\"Brothers and Sisters\\".  Shame on Oprah.    Zeb Kantrowitz

6305327041|5.0|This one of THE funniest movies I've ever seen. The third vignette (The Mis-behavers)  is the highlight of the film (there's just something funny about booze, kids, used syringes and dead hookers). I highly recommend this to anyone with a dark and twisted sense of humor.
0786948523|4.0|I have been playing RPGs for a few years now and I have seen many types of monster manuals.  I'm not going to go into much details, but here are the points I liked, and the stuff I thought they could do better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It has a little bit of everything you might want.<br />Easy to read<br />Laid out clear monster blocks<br /><br />Cons:<br />Being the first publication of the monster manual, I thought more common creatures players will run into at lower levels (below 20th) would had been nice.  For example, one of the creatures they have in the monster manual was different types of Abominations which are level 20+ monsters from the War of the Primordials.  Cool, but not necessarily needed in the first Monster Manual.  What would had been nice was an expanded Human, Elf, Eladrin, Dragonborn, Goblinoid, ect sections with more diversity of opponent options up to 20th level.  These creatures might not have the flair that the Abominations have, but your more likely to use them in a gaming session with level 1 and 2 players.<br /><br />Although, if you get Monster Manual 2, they flush out the more common monsters including expanding the opponent options for Humans, Elves, ect.  So as a DM, you will need both.<br /><br />So in the end, good content, but a different layout would had been nice.
0670022411|1.0|I was excited to take a look at A Discovery of Witches - anything that comes to my attention without me looking for it must be good, or so I thought. I looked at the price of the Kindle version and was dismayed at the inflated price - had it been cheaper, I would have purchased it outright. Thank goodness for the Kindle \\"sample\\" feature. I did download that and began to read hoping to be hooked enough that I would overlook the high price in favor of being pulled into the storyline. My editor would have ripped my head off had I presented him with a book that had such an information dump at the front end of the story. From other reviews of this book I've looked at in conjuction with the sample I digested, I can not justify going further into the book (there are so many others to choose from) or justify the purchase at its current pricepoint. I'm very disappointed.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|This movie was such a let down. The previews made it seem like this amazing epic cinematic experience, instead you wait the whole movie waiting for something interesting to take place. Well it never does take place.

B004SKHJF2|5.0|I wish people would rate the apps and not the issues that their phones have.  I was a shazam user long before when the service was free. I upgraded from my HTC hero to the Evo and wasn't able to grandfather the free service so I had to deal with the 5 tags a month. I went to soundhound free afterwards but with this being the full featured great app I knew I am coming back.  It tags songs with great accuracy, the widget is slick, and did i mention this is free! Thank you Amazon for the great freebie today!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the reviews here on Amazon, so I thought I'd give The Hunger Games a go.  A few pages in, I thought I wouldn't like it.  I mean, it was about a girl and written in the first person present tense.  That's all cool, but just not for me.      Anyway, I read on...and I am glad I did.  I couldn't put the book down!  I don't think I've ever read a book so quickly.  \\"Just one more page,\\" I'd keep telling myself.  Ha, no such thing as just one more page with this read.    I won't give away any spoilers - but the book is action packed, suspenseful and extremely well written.  I would recommend this to all adults and teens alike.  Fantastic.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I hate the app because I can't get it. The app will not show up in \\"My Apps\\" on my device. Additionally, if I 1-click to try to order it, I am told that I already own the app, so nothing happens. Amazon.com is showing the app in \\"My Apps\\" here but alas the app will not show up on my device. Put in a request to customer service to try and get the app removed from my account to try and get it again, so we will see how that goes.
B001O54NL2|3.0|Okay, I said when I originally wrote this review that I'd give this album another chance. On further listening, maybe 2 stars in the original was a bit harsh: I listened to it before in the car and the album is a little quiet, which meant some of the melodies were harder to hear. But honestly, the stand-out tracks remain Sailing and Ride Like The Wind. Some of the other material is pleasant but no longer as enticing as on the the album's release. And that was my point, hence the title of my review: the material has now dated. If this album means a lot to you, because it holds memories for you or you're just feeling nostalgic, fine. But for anyone else looking for some soft rock or pop - I guess Chris Cross fitted into the adult oriented rock category - there is better material from around that time (Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, say) and other more current material today. I've left my my original words intact in the next paragraph.  Amazon wanted me to review this purchase, so here I am, looking at the other reviews and wondering if they and I have listened to the same album. Cross's debut release in 1979 was a huge hit and won 5 Grammy's besides. I didn't buy the album then, but I always liked Sailing and Ride Like the Wind - and a friend of mine likes it hugely; I've heard the album through in the past, but over 20 years ago. Just recently I couldn't get Ride Like the Wind out of my head, so I bought this album. This isn't the sort of stuff I normally listen to, which my wife tolerates when I inflict it on her in the car. But when we both listened to this recently, she was moved to say it was rubbish. I'll be a little more generous and say that the album has not aged well. Yes, the tracks I bought the album for I still really enjoy. But frankly, if it wasn't for those, this album would be a 1-star review: I can't think of an occasion when I'd want to play the whole thing through again - though out of respect for my co-reviewers and their rave reviews, I'll give it another listen and adjust my review if I think differently the second time through.
B0041OWHH0|4.0|I had already watched the movie, so I wanted it for my dvd collection.  Great value, but I didn't realize part of the reason for this was the fact that both movies were burned on the same dvd, just front and back.    Would have liked to know this before buying.

B003UESJF6|5.0|This is a great, brilliant, fun, ironic, entertaining film that takes on some very serious questions about good and evil in the most entertaining and lighthearted way. Tom McGrath did a brilliant job. I've seen one negative review and I'm pretty sure (having gone to Cal-Arts along side McGrath and a multitude of other amazing animators - almost all good but one who is evil) that the person wrote the comment was someone who was just jealous of McGrath's talent. Seriously, this is on the level of a top quality, best of the best Pixar style animated film. It's FANTASTIC! Kudoos to all involved! If you are a fan of going to a film with your kids and enjoying it on a totally different level than they do, this is for you.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The authors put a lot of effort into the details of the graphics in this game.  The levels are fun puzzles to figure out and master.  This is one of my favorite games on the Droid and my kids like it too.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Shazam is a terrific app. It's very good at id's and has no ads. I know soundhound is free, but it's not as good as shazam in some respects. They both are great apps, but shazam can find songs that soundhound sometimes cannot.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I have an Ipod and recently purchaced a Zune player. I have my playeys hooked up to Bose speakers and I basically use my players as a stereo system. I like the quality better with my Zune player better than my Ipod, but it doesn't get to a loud volume level. The FiiO E5 Headphone Amplifier solved this problem. It gives me a louder volume level without distortion. I'm sure there are better amplifiers out there, but for 20 something dollars this was well worth it and serves its purpose
B000OVLINI|5.0|This was one of the better written books that I've read in awhile - beautiful descriptions without feeling tedious, a fascinating story that gets more complex with each chapter, but brilliantly. I really enjoyed this book which seemed to offer a little bit of everything - it is really a mammoth of a story, where Zafon takes his time to tell seemingly every story and quaint thought he's ever had, but somehow managed to do it brilliantly, in my opinion. You get a little bit of everything here - gothic, dark descriptions, a massive cast of characters, each with their own secrets and stories - the book is peppered with life lessons and ruminations, ridiculous humor, heart breaking turns of events and moments of hope in the middle of despair. I found it gritty and depressing and yet breath taking and filled with a sense that \\"maybe things can still work out\\" even when it seems unlikely, or even impossible.
B00005NGAK|4.0|I bought VHS tape back in 1999 after watching it on PBS. And then I gave the tape as gift to my friend and bought DVD when it came out. Then I lost the DVD recently and had to buy it again.    I love Irish music and dances. This show is about as good as it gets for me because it has combination of all the good ingredients I love - dance, music and a nice flow of storyline. (and I confess another ingredient is the dancers themselves)    Enough has been said about this show in other people's review, so I'm not gonna repeat. However I want to point out some \\"technical\\" issues based on my 3 purchases of this program: by far I have to say that the VHS sound quanlity is the best among the 3 copies I had/have. It sounds strange because DVD is supposed to have much better sound and video spec, but it's just the fact. The DVD copy that I lost had unstable sound, in both sound tracks. The volume can go suddently lower than normal, like the Dolby-Noise processing in the old cassett tape days. And the new copy I just bought has poor video quality - some dimly lit areas of the stage seem to have green-ish background without real contents in it, like what you see through the night vision lenses, but you don't see anything but the green background visual noise. And on top of that issue, the video resolution is poor, worse than the previous DVD I owned. Many scenes have double/ghost images or seems like out of focus.    I don't understand why this happened because they should all come from the same master copy made in 1998, right? Anyway I'm not going to buy another copy until maybe the Blu-ray version is available.    It's really unfair to give it just 4 star rating. I would give 5 star for the show, but 3 star only for the DVD technical quality.
1591843790|2.0|I almost gave up on this book about halfway through it. Fortunately (or maybe unfortunately), I possess a certain pathology that compels me to keep reading a book no matter how bad it is. It's like that late, late movie that's so bad, you can't stop watching it. At least, I can't. I have to know how it turns out.    Reading Enchantment is like watching a movie that starts out predictable and bad. You feel like you've seen the movie before under some other name. You assume there's going to be a different perspective, but you keep seeing very recognizable themes. They wouldn't make the same movie twice, would they?     The first half of Enchantment feels like a combination of several different books you've read before -- which is further supported by the fact that Kawasaki cites more outside resources in the first half of the book than any other book I've ever read. The first half of this book is really a book about other books. And (I'm not going to sugarcoat it), it's filled with some pretty silly advice. \\"If you want people to like you, you have to be likable.\\" Really.    Kawasaki also takes one of THE silliest positions I've ever seen an author take in a book. Instead of using the royal \\"he\\" as a pronoun throughout the book, Kawasaki states that he's going to use \\"she\\" for all positive references and \\"he\\" for references to negative behavior or \\"bad\\" people. His justification for this position is some conjured up notion that women have been persecuted in literature \\"for centuries.\\" It smacked of pandering to me and I almost put the book down at that point.    But then, in the second half, just about the time you think that all hope is lost for this endeavor, the movie gets better. Enchantment becomes a different book altogether. Kawasaki starts offering practical advice (admittedly, much of which I had not heard before) and he provides a perspective that, obviously, only he can give. But isn't that true for everyone?    There are things to learn in this book. He boils a lot of his advice down to quick bullet points and action items for winding your way down the path to enchantment (getting sick of that word yet?).    Ultimately, I think the undoing of this book is that it's a bit too forced. To wit: I believe Kawasaki has a colossal ego. I believe the intent of this book is to attempt to create a new buzzword: Enchantment. Kawasaki's ego is fed with the knowledge that high-net-worth individuals are walking around the top floor of an office building talking to each other using the new buzzword that he \\"created.\\" Here's the problem with that: nobody who wants to be taken seriously longer than 30 seconds is going to use the word \\"enchanted\\" or \\"enchantment\\" in a professional environment. Can you imagine sitting in a meeting and hearing someone say, \\"You know, I'm really enchanted with that new vendor.\\" You would assume that person watched The Little Mermaid over the weekend and took it a little bit too much to heart. The word is too New Agey, too ethereal and there are too many other better words that mean the same thing.    I'm still recommending this book (but just barely), because I think there are some things you can learn from it. But, for those of you (like me) who expected to get a sequel to The Art of The Start (which I recommend all the the time, by the way), or something comparable in quality, this book is most decidedly NOT that.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|the sad thing is i feel the free version of soundhound is bettter than this paid one. the only advantage i can see is prehaps shazam is a bit simpler in its interface though otherwise sh is just so much better.
B000L212HW|5.0|I love this movie. If I happen to see if on Fios/Cable while working (I watch movies/cable while working) I always turn it on.  I especially love the soundtrack.
B000002L80|5.0|I love every song on this CD,,,i have the original cassette tape from the 80's and finally found the cd version here on Amazon.  I know you will enjoy it as much as i do with its cleverly written songs.  The Talking Heads will not dissapoint!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|i was excited 2 c rio come out, i enjoyed the salsa style music, and seeing that the grafics were better then ever, i play one level at a time to enjoy the epic struggle to free the caged brids, i heard that the blue makacs joun the fray great app highly recommand to any angry birds fan.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Always returns the result &quot;sorry, we didn't find a match&quot; no matter what song that I have tried. Tried on the Droid X running stock Froyo.
B004L49K20|5.0|Duran Duran is indeed back! Wow this was a trip back to the old days and reminded me of all the great New Order, Duran Duran albums of the time. What surprised me most was that EVERY SINGLE TRACK was amazing! Usually an album will have 2 maybe 3 good tracks but this is the best flowing album I've ever heard from any artist. The party feeling is there throughout with a few deeper slow songs which are beautiful and haunting. The album ends with an emotional bang and my balls are still tingling!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game! Works well on my LG. I actually enjoy the music and background artwork better on Rio better than the original Birds. Is that twenty five?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best all in one bible app.  I used to have multiple apps to be able to do what this app does on its own.  Many reading plans, widgets, audio bibles, and different languages and versions all in one.  Great and easy way to stay connected with God with his Word.
0385533829|3.0|The book is exactly as described but I was very disappointed because they did not pack it properly and all the sides were dent.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I played this version after downloading it from the Android market. Now I'm not sure what the difference was but that version held up movement on my phone. I have since deleted it.<br /><br />After downloading this version on Amazon I cannot stop playing. The screen shots move like water no hesitation, no stagnant shots.<br /><br />The only issue which you can resolve by changing your settings is you will be logged into the App Store until you change your settings.<br /><br />Go Amazon, I'm looking forward to the next free app made available.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun, challenging, and addictive, just like the original Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons. Runs great on the Nexus One. It would be worth the $0.99, but getting it for free on the appstore is even better.
B004L49K20|3.0|To all who think this is the return of Duran Duran, well they never really went away, but for all those that think this is the true follow up to RIO....you are sorely mistaken.    I agree with another reviewer their 1st 3 albums had a truly Exotic, power pop feel to them. Some might call them bubblegum & there may be some validity to that, BUT where Duran Duran was different was that they were head & shoulders above everybody else trying to do what they were perfecting.    To me this sounds like what \\"NOTORIOUS\\" should have been, but in my opinion where Astronaut succeeded this fails. Duran Duran works best when it's all 5 original members. Take one away & their sound changes dramtically. This is why albums like the Wedding Album were so polarizing & Astronaut brought out the old school fans. Asrtonaut fits so easy next to their 1st records it's scary. It's a perfect meld of old school & a little dab of new school.    Grant it this is a strong album and while the album as a whole isn't that strong, there are 1 or 2 clunkers on here, it works. But between this album & Astronaut i'm grabbing for Astronaut.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|this app is one of the best out there works like a charm ..i have tried it like 15 times and it has worked all of the times awesome !!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|really enjoy this game! even better than the original one. would recommend. it is so addictive though!!! ahhhhh so watch out because this is going to suck up ur time

B004EPYZU8|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars)<br /><br />The bottom line on Sucker Punch is that it's dazzling at times but often drags at many other times.  I really enjoyed Zach Snyder's 300 and liked parts of Watchmen, and I knew from those films he could be counted on to provide a visually impressive motion picture.  However, this new film really only comes alive in the fantasy sequences.  What happens is that the title character, Baby Doll, is unjustly imprisoned in an insane asylum by an evil stepdad eager to get his hands on her late mom's riches.  It turns out the asylum has a profitable sideline going, a pleasure-for-hire business involving the nubile inmates/ dancers and run by one of the orderlies.  Or I guess that's a level of fantasy in itself, removed from the grubby reality of the actual asylum.  Within that \\"private dancer\\" / inmate fantasy, Baby Doll has her own fantasy world she retreats into while she's dancing.  In that world, Scott Glenn is a sensei / commander, and after an initial solo battle, Baby Doll is joined by her fellow hot inmates on three \\"missions\\" that will lead to their escape from the asylum in the higher fantasy plane.  (Yes, shades of Inception in the two layers of fantasy.) One battle involves a fight against steam-powered nazi undead (!), the 2nd against a dragon, and the final, futuristic one against shiny robots protecting a bomb.  The \\"missions\\" are each quite striking visually (although the first solo battle is only so-so), but the action REALLY DRAGS when events switch back to the asylum.  I found myself wishing the asylum scenes would be over quickly so we could get back to the \\"missions.\\"  This movie is worth renting for the fantasy missions/ battles, but I wouldn't rush right out and see it in a theater.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I just got this and when I tested it, perfect! I like the feature that it can show you the lyrics. Great app. Thanks for making this!
1591843790|5.0|I have read 5 of Guy's books. This is the most useful book since now I am working for Govt. I had hard time in the beginning to adjust Govt work-life. Here at my work I find more emphasis on Likability and Trsustworthiness which the author has listed first two basic chapters in this book. I know this is the fundamental of human relationships as Dale Carnegie has written back in 1937.    The web conf that the author conducted few days ago on this book was fantastic. I followed his advise 10/20/30 concept on presentation to others. Actually, I used it in a team project back in 2008. It worked very well.    Overall, He has writen most of the books in a practical and common-sense approach. You can apply his wisdom in any work either you are entrepreneur or business person or in your family life. He used most of the examples in his books from a human perspective. I learned some new word, Mensch, from his book and I got a bokk on \\"Mensch\\" from the local library.    I follow his tweets and they are full of wisdom related tweets. I have advised my friends to follow him on tweeter.    I would highly recommend any parents to buy this book for their sons or daughters. The more you learn thsese wisdoms in early part of your life, the more better human being and a professional business person you can become.    I am rate this book a five star book
B0032FPVKE|2.0|Quality of the bag for price is OK. But, it does not have enough space to hold camcorder and its gadgets.    If you are looking to store camcorder and its gadgets(remote,charger etc) better go for different product.    Horrible no space at all.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Using a Nexus S, it works great but its a little slow, found a lot of songs I thought it would never find... Rage, Skindred, Gorillaz, and even Cage the Elephant
1400052173|5.0|Every once in awhile I come across a book that forever stays with me.  This is one of those.    I am not a big non-fiction reader, but the excerpt of this book I read in Oprah's magazine had me enthralled.    I am so thankful that I read this, and the story of Henrietta Lacks and her descendants will stay with me, always.  While there is definitely a lot written about the more scientific side of things -- how and why the HeLa cells became so important to scientific research -- the more amazing part for me was learning about Henrietta's life, and the lives of her children long after she died.  The Lacks family has gone through an unfathomable amount of heartache, tragedy, and injustice; yet they still opened their hearts and their lives to the author (well, with MUCH patience and perseverance on the author's part!).  How anyone could ever learn to trust again after what they've been through speaks of their goodness and generosity.    We read this for my book club, and it led to an amazing and interesting discussion.    I give it my absolute highest recommendation.
B004SKHJF2|2.0|I played an anime song and SoundHound picked it up in less than 3 seconds. Shazam recorded it for 8 seconds but returned with no match.
B000E994KE|5.0|Heard the song House of Sleep on youtube and looked into the band more. Bought this album at the FYE I used to work at. Holy crap, fantastic. The entire album is awesome. The two tracks that stand out the most are House of Sleep and The Smoke. Head over to youtube and watch the videos (just to hear the songs, really) to see if you dig Amorphis. This is the album that got me hooked, so perhaps it can work its wonders on you.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very useful and accurate. What? Reviews are 25 word minimum? Why? Am I there yet? I'm running out of words.. Ahh still not enough! OMG will I ever get there?
B004SBS8LA|4.0|i love this game. the graphics are awesome. i am glad I am able to enjoy it. Can't wait until the other levels come out. so excited!
1591843790|5.0|This is an incredibly engaging book.  The core of Enchantment is that you have to be likable, trustworthy, and have a great product or service. Sounds obvious but how you get there is not.  For example, likeability starts from your physical appearance, that you have a real smile (Duchenne smile) that incorporates both your eyes and your mouth.  The second part of likeability in this initial impression is your dress - you're not dressed above the crowd, you're not dressed below the crowd. And the next thing is your physical contact of a handshake.  (He even provides a mathematical formula for the perfect handshake).  Now, likeability in and of itself is not enough; you also need to get trusted.  Kawasaki argues that the first thing you have to do if you want to be trusted - is that you first have to trust.  It's not a chicken or egg thing, the onus is upon you to trust first. A great example of that is Zappos--where Zappos basically says `we trust you.' So if you don't like the shoe we will even pay shipping it back to us, so there's truly no risk. And if Zappos had had a different attitude of--`well, we are a startup right now, if you don't like the shoe, you're going to have to send it back at your expense,' it would not be the billion dollar success that it is.  A great read.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Really fun game in the vain of the original Angry Birds.  Play the original (for free!) to get the hand-holding tutorial levels.  This game jumps right in.  Most levels play well on my base model phone.  A quarter of them (so far) seem to slow way down as they overtax my phone's meager 600MHz processor.<br /><br />DEVs: Thank you for being considerate of your users and both not autostarting your app and allowing us to move your app to SD card. Thank you! Anything you can do to further reduce the 2.5MB remaining on the phone's extremely limited internal storage would be much appreciated.  Further optimizations for low end processors, like turning off animated backgrounds (like in the original game) would also be welcome!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This it's a five star application, what I don't understand is how it's being given away free, momentarily anyways. It does what it should, quickly and easily with no complaints. A bit expensive normally though.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|This is a great utility.  It works really well for US music.  Foreign music like J-Pop, K-Pop, and Thai is hit or miss, but mostly miss.  I got this app for free which puts it on par with Sound Hound.  I'd get the free Sound Hound before I payed for Shazam Encore.    ATTN Devs: Code your apps so they can be moved to SD card.  My phones internal storage is extremely limited.  Shazam Encore, you're taking up a little over 3MB of my internal storage for an app I'll use at most once a week.  Be considerate of your end users!  I know widgets don't work when moved to SD.  Split the widgets out into another cooperating app if need be.  On the other hand, thank you for not autostarting your app like many other more inconsiderate developers do.
B004GYY714|5.0|Just downloaded this app and I absolultely love it!!  There are so many different stations to pick from and you can also search for your favorite radio stations.  The sound is clear with no static, no problem with buffering, everything sounds great!! I highly recommend this app!!
B000Y7U98W|5.0|This movie deserves an Extended Edition, incorporating all the Deleted scenes.<br /><br />Acting was great & the Story is very convincing.<br /><br />It deserves 10 stars, in my opinion.
0802473156|5.0|This book is a must read for every married couple.  This would also be very beneficial to couples engaged to be married.
B0006SNK9E|5.0|This album is the remastered American release of Sweet Fanny Adams (sweet f**** all)in case you didn't get it - which non Americans would know is different to the Sweet F.A. that was originally released.    Having said that' it is great to have all the 'bonus material' that we have loved before added to this classic 'ALL KILLER - NO FILLER' in my opinion best ever Sweet album.    I must say that I'm not sure how much re-mastering has been done but adding songs to call it re-mastering and not messing up the original is good enough for me at the moment for now.    Now all I wish for is this band to get it's due respect that is so long over due!    More and more bands are showing respect and tribute, so now it's up to us the music fans.    LOVE THIS ALBUM!
B004SKHJF2|1.0|The program does not run, keeps telling me to reinstall, even after doing so. CM6 on EVO. Can't complain since it's free so hopefully they'll fix thw issue.
B000H7J9R6|3.0|The Good -- This remake is more of a dramatic ghost story, than a straight-up horror movie. There are no cliched jump scares, just a snowballing chilling effect that sets this apart from other recent Asian Horror remakes and horror movies in general.<br /><br />The cast's acting is above average. John C. Reilly, as usual, stands out, acts rings around a sometimes, but not often, lost Jennifer Connelly. Good acting really can make a pedestrian movie better.<br /><br />The Bad -- Enough with the water! The director repeatedly beats the viewer in the head with water images that by the sixth or seventh time, it becomes tired and trite.<br /><br />There's no reason why this movie needed to run longer than 90 minutes. All the characters and situations are established early on; there are no real character arcs. Perhaps if the editing was more tight, then the lack of any character development could have been ignored and the water motifs and general suspense would have been more effective.<br /><br />The Ugly -- The final resolution to the haunting. First, it's preceded by a false resolution similar to The Ring. Second, it comes out of nowhere, being neither shocking nor logical. The only evidence that foretells the resolution is circumstantial. We're told the ending, in a way, not shown it.<br /><br />Nothing really stands out in this movie. While the acting is good and certain scenes are chilling, neither of these attributes can help this movie from being nothing more than mediocre.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Tried this out, but it did not recognize anything I tried to use it on.  Not even a \\"Is this maybe what you want?\\" - just zero results every time.  I attempted several methods.  Using the phone's speaker normally and cupping it to give more sound to the microphone.  I tried my car stereo with and without the motor running (in case background noise messed it up).  I also tried at home with my stereo system at low, mid, and high volumes, but no luck.  It was stated somewhere that this doesn't work, but I thought since real music wasn't working, maybe if I hummed? Nothing.  Sang? Nothing.  Spoke the lyrics? Nope, not that either.<br /><br />Some of the other commenters suggested 'Soundhound', so just to see if it was me doing something wrong or the app, I went and got the free version of Soundhound and tested it, and it was giving me the correct song names about 80% of the time, and the other 20%, it at least gave me \\"We're not sure, but is it one of these songs?\\" and gave a list (which was never on the list, but hey, at least it tried!)<br /><br />I have to rate Shazam down because it doesn't do anything for me whatsoever.  Wish it did, it looks like it'd be handy to have around!
B003Q6D25U|4.0|The Good -- This movie builds the suspense nicely. Whereas the first movie was practically non-stop chills, this one doles out the creepiness in little doses, increasing the fright until the inevitable end.<br /><br />The male lead here doesn't act like such an jerk like the male lead in the first movie. I appreciated that greatly.<br /><br />The Bad -- While not essential, watching the prequel beforehand will really enhance the complete viewing experience. Events in the prequel are referenced and will make more sense after watching this one. On its own, Paranormal Activity 2 is good, but not great.<br /><br />Another stain on this decent film is that the family installs security cameras throughout their house, but only check the footage occasionally, therefore not validating their individual supernatural experiences. That's just dumb.<br /><br />The Ugly -- Comparisons between this and the first movie are bound to exist. While watching this one, I kept expecting scary things to happen because, after all, they did in the first one. Watching the first one  to compliment each other is a double-edged sword because neither now stand on their own. However, that's not enough to downgrade this movie to a lower rating.
0060936223|3.0|Patti too often derails into slanted new-agey babble just for the sake of adding layers. It's frustrating and pointless. She seems to think that any obscure old reference will do, at any juncture, or that playing the hippie nonsense card randomly will aid in her self-mythologizing.     Or, perhaps she is just playing to her publisher's marketing demographic. An aging housewife looking with melancholic starry eyes toward every strained 60's-ism, I am not. For me it was just disappointing.     As a rocker autobio, & the memoir of a poet in NYC, the book works much better. The narrative was fresh and sweet, & bubbling with rewards. \\"Just Kids\\" evokes time & place very well, and returns the reader to his/her own age of discovery. I was charmed. It's just a shame that the author's scholastic confusion and faux-hippie persona got in the way.
B004J00QLU|4.0|As the one other sensible reviewer said here, just because you don't need something doesn't mean no one else does and that you should rate it poorly. Does it do what it's supposed to? Yes.    This is my favorite of the task killers, although there isn't a huge difference between them. It's more a matter of taste. I'm stuck running android 2.1 for now, and it's useful to me, so I rate it 4.    Notice that most of the 1-star reviews aren't from people who think the app isn't a good task killer, they are from people who don't like task killers. Maybe I should go leave 1-star reviews for all the romance novels and linux programming books, since I have no interest in either and think they are a waste of time.
B0007G89G4|4.0|I love this movie and give it five stars, but this \\"deluxe edition\\" is a disappointment. I bought it based on James W. Anderson's review, because I wanted to hear the movie in stereo. Well, it's still mono. In fact, it was filmed in mono, so there is no \\"original multi-channel soundtrack.\\" This is just the special edition with a lame \\"collectible 32-page booklet and music cd.\\" The booklet adds nothing that's not already on the dvd, and the cd just has eight mono 50's songs from the movie. Save your money. Be like 91% of the people who viewed this item and buy the special edition instead.
B004L49K20|5.0|Having been a fan of Duran Duran since their self-titled debut, I have followed their career fairly closely. No doubt, they've had some highs and lows, and I think that after 7 and the Ragged Tiger, they lost some of their innate sound. Having said that AYNIN is a strong return to their roots. Not only are the chord progressions and instrumentation classic DURAN DURAN, but Simon LeBon sounds like he did 20+ years ago, and the songs all have a bit of modern sheen. Lyrically, musically and sonically, this album destroys anything they've put out since 7 and The Ragged Tiger. Amazing return to form while sounding fresh. PS...BEFORE THE RAIN and THE MAN WHO STOLE A LEOPARD are perfection.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|I prefer soundhound. it is a better experiemce. but what i do like about shazam is that it has a widget. that really makes it easier to get to when you donMt know how long a song is going to play that you want to know :)
B001EN71DQ|4.0|The content in this DVD set is pretty abundant. There are deleted scenes, behind the scenes interviews, photo gallery, etc...    The only thing that I don't like about this DVD edition is the font of the caption is too large and it doesn't look good if you set the caption on. This is probably because I play it on HDTV. This is also why I should just wait a bit longer to get the blue ray edition. (the news of the release of blue ray edition just came out after a month after I ordered this......)

B00005OCMR|5.0|The most impressive  truth about Disney's 1982 computer-game fantasy is that stands the test of time.  The Movie is  about a computer wizard named Flynn(Jeff Bridges)who is digitally broken down into a data stream by a villainous computer.  He is reconstituted into a 3-d world of the computer were fantastic Computerworld exists.  The Main character Flynn must escape and stop the evil main program taking over the computer world.  This is a great movie for any science fiction collector to add to there collection.

B0041KKYEW|3.0|Nobody can deny that Darren Aranofsky can use the camera, but in Black Swan, he substitutes shock and style for substance.  Using a narrative framework that is as old as the movies itself (backstage melodrama) and cliche characters in thinly-veiled pseudo-Freudian roles (the self-doubting ingenue, the dictatorial stage mother, the worldly free-spirit), Aranofsky uses the camera not to disclose but to shock with David Lynch-like surrealism and suspense more derivative of Brian De Palma than Alfred Hitchcock.  Natalie Portman's physical preparation for her role was heroic, but her performance is unidimensional (insecure anxiety). Aranofsky has done some brilliant work before (Requiem for a Dream, most notably), but this lacks depth and subtlety. To paraphrase a former senator, \\"I know David Lynch films.  I am a fan of David Lynch films.  And, you, Mr. Aranofsky, are no David Lynch.\\"

B002ZG99TA|4.0|I'll admit that when I first heard the storyline from the movie UNSTOPPABLE I didn't think it sounded very interesting. It's difficult to make a movie about a speeding train exciting. You know it's confined to a track and that it moves fast with the chance of slipping off the rails but how could that be exciting? The makers of this movie, especially director Tony Scott proved me wrong. And I'm glad about that.<br /><br />It's Will's (Chris Pine) first day as a conductor on a normal day for this train. His engineer is Frank (Denzell Washington), soon to retired and making one of his last runs. But their day will turn out to be anything but ordinary.<br /><br />Two goofups are at another station moving a different train. When the switch to move it to a different track isn't set, the engineer jumps down to reset it himself, leaving the train in neutral. Not only that, the air breaks haven't been set yet but since they're just moving it to another line they're not concerned. That is until the train shifts into high speed mode and leaves the station before he and his conductor can get on board.<br /><br />The train picks up speed the further down the line it goes. Without the air breaks there's no way to stop it. To make matters worse, the load this train was carrying contained dangerous toxic chemicals. If that wasn't enough, the line the train is heading down has a section with a tight curve that there is no way to make without derailing.<br /><br />The train is on a collision course with two trains on the same track. One is a group of school students learning about train safety. The other is Will and Frank's cargo train. Their train narrowly misses being demolished. After a discussion with controller Connie (Rosario Dawson), Frank comes up with a possible plan of his own to stop the train.<br /><br />As higher ups try and decide what to do Connie (Rosario Dawson) attempts to assist them. But of course they think she doesn't know what she's talking about and brush her off. They're plan is to derail the train in a smaller town with a piece of equipment that Frank has told Connie has no chance of working at the speed the train is moving. When it does indeed fail, Connie, Frank and Will follow through with their own plan, even though the top dogs have threatened to fire them if they do.<br /><br />The drama of the film escalates at the same pace the train is making. Frank and Will's train is racing against time going backwards to catch up to the non-stop express. Will they make it in time? Will their plan work? Hey, I might tell you a few things that happen in a movie but I won't reveal the end.<br /><br />Washington and Pine do a great job here as two men who just met but who become close through the situation they find themselves in. Each has problems of their own back home that play into their decision, but never to the point that they abandon the chance to save innocent lives. These are not men who became heroes over time but who have a definite moral core that guides them to make the choice to save lives.<br /><br />Based on a true story, the events that unfold in this film are set at a pace that won't allow you to sit still comfortable on the couch and not care. It draws you in, waiting to see what attempts are made, which ones work and waiting to see if the plan Frank and Will have come up with must be used or not.<br /><br />The pacing of the film is perfect. Not only does Scott gradually increase the speed of the train, he slowly unravels the stories of the two heroes as well. Back history and current situations drive them to the decision they make.

B0041KKYBA|4.0|Good documentary. It only missed one thing. If it touched on this one thing I don't think people would like this show as much. The one thing is it does not take into account that to many people out there looking for the American Dream (owning a home)should not have taken on big mortgages especially with adjustable rates that they could not afford. If they did a little math a 3rd. grader could do they could have seen tough times ahead. We can not bail out anyone every again, especially our ponzi scheme banking system. That is what a free-market is all about, sink or swim.

B004J4WQ46|4.0|I don't like the title. I don't like the artwork. I don't like how the opening track didn't blow me away. And I haven't liked all the hype leading up to Angles, the fourth album from The Strokes. Why mention these things? Because these are all things that The Strokes have always done right, even on their many side project releases. The titles and covers and opening tracks are always so spot on that I can't help but root for the project - whatever it may be. Plain and simple, Strokes leader and frontman, Julian Casablancas (who released a surprisingly great solo record in 2009) is a tastemaker. He brought the 70s garage aesthetic back to the mainstream with The Strokes' 2001 classic Is This It and has here and there influenced fashion, rock celebrity and music ever since. With Angles I get none of that, which, for a longtime devout fan, is alarming.    But who cares. People don't look at album covers or memorize titles or even listen to full track lists anymore. They pick out their two or four or six favorite songs and toss them onto the ocean of music that is their backup drive. Not me. And maybe I'm dreaming, but I like to think that I'm not the only listener who thinks the art of album making is still going strong. Anyhow, those mostly aesthetic hurdles aside, Angles does feel more like front-to-back record than most, even if it doesn't quite accomplish the return to glory vibe we were promised. Instead, we get a somewhat schizophrenic sounding set that features a handful of songs that could very easily do well as radio singles, including \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" and \\"Taken For a Fool.\\"    Stories surrounding the recording of the album tell us that Casablancas, tired of being the band's leader, ended up leaving the sessions and communicating with his fellow bandmates via e-mail and text while they recorded their parts without him. He'd record his vocals at a separate studio and, as he puts it, force the others to figure out things for themselves. Me? I hate that.Sure, Albert Hammond, Jr. had that one great solo album, but, for the most part, I like this band for one reason: Julian Casablancas. What results from this method is a record that feels like a mix of early Strokes and, say, MGMT. The bulk of the record doesn't feature the production jump that First Impressions of Earth had, but it doesn't offer the lean/raw sound of the band's first two - and by-far best - records.    As good as about half this record is, Angles as a whole often feels too produced, too modern to really offer the Strokes appeal we all look for when we buy a Strokes disc. Songs like \\"Metabolism\\" and \\"You're So Right\\" are downright annoying while \\"Two Kinds of Happiness,\\" though a decent pop song, feels like a good song that was run through some sort of 1980s filter. \\"Games,\\" one of the record's big winners, sounds like it belongs on Casablancas' recent solo record while \\"Under Cover,\\" \\"Taken For a Fool\\" and \\"Gratisfaction\\" all sound like early-era Strokes songs, the later a jukebox blaster of epic proportions.    In the end, only five of the album's cuts are completely solid, two need to disappear forever and the other three are either half-great or growers. And so we end up with a decent enough record that is maybe better than First Impressions (which featured an amazing first half) but not nearly as memorable as those first two Strokes releases. The truly great moments make the Angles worth buying; the growers make it worth talking about; the big stinkers make Angles an album to worry about. All that said, the fourth Strokes band album is certainly worth getting to know, even if it will likely continue the post-Is This It heartbreak longtime believers have been suffering though. Face it, friends, The Strokes will never again be that perfect garage pop band that so many of us fell so hard for back in 2001.    Check out more of my reviews at [...]
031603438X|3.0|For someone who has led such an outrageous \\"Life\\", this book is a bit of a non-event.  Keith's always good for a laugh or two, but this feels more like an extended, shallow magazine piece rather than some heavy tell-all from the guy who has done it all.  Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt\\" is way better (I can't believe I just said that!)

0956827810|5.0|A title could be a book. For the wrethched souls who toil producing letters to make literature or those that produce the reviews of it, it is a non-book. People interested in reading between the lines may be disappointed. But with 'Man' and 'sex' as bold letters on it's cover, it could be a success. The difference between note-book and book has been eliminated-give or take the title. The five stars are for the silence after the cover.    [[ASIN:B004AHKC5C The Underclass Lover]]

1416972242|5.0|Mrs. Lightwood and Max, then later Mr. Lightwood, return to the Institute to run things now that Hodges is no longer around.  Clary's mother is still in a coma in the hospital with Luke by her side daily.  Clary is trying her hardest with her boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, along with other relationships new in her life.  Jace is having horrible nightmares and on a path of self destruction.  It seems everyone is turning on him and no one trusts Jace now that everyone knows his is his fathers son.  But are they right?  While Jace is in prison for the night in the Silent City the Soul Sword, one of the three Mortal Instruments, is stolen.  Could it be a coincidence or not?  Now not only is the cup missing so is the Soul Sword.  There has to be only one person behind all this... Valentine.  But, what is he up to?    This book is soooo definitely the middle child.  Oh, yes, this book has a story line of its own with pecks and a huge climax to that story.  But the threading storyline between these books is the one I really want to know about.  I came into City of Ashes with a few big questions.  Big questions which I was hoping to find answers for.  The first 150 pages are good, really good, but I still wonder if these books were worthy of all the hype?  At 150 pages in, Eeee.  Then when I wasn't looking Cassandra sucker punched me with her twisting ideas and happenings.  This is not a bad thing.  As I then realized once again she had drawn me into this world and characters so deeply I couldn't put the book down and I didn't even know it until I couldn't stop.  Those first 150 pages are the basis setup for the 300 pages coming afterward, that don't stop surprising and pleasing the reader.    As I got more information, but not really the answers.  The characters are all growing in their personalities and becoming a close net group to me.  I learned more of the different dark races and their abilities start to come to more into light in this book.  I also started to learn some history of the Shadowhunters.   As I enjoyed all this information I left this book with even more questions.  This need to know drove me to run out and buy the third book of the trilogy.  I am very addicted and HAVE TO KNOW.
B001EOOQF6|5.0|The incredible follow-up to 1980's HEAVEN AND HELL opus, 1981 saw the Ronnie James Dio-fronted BLACK SABBATH navigating the turbulent metal seas with the leviathan that was MOB RULES. H&H found SABBATH revitalized with a newfound creativity thanks to the superb writing skills and unmatched vocal prowess of their new frontman. That album yielded many a classic track and 30-years on, stands proud as one of the band's greatest achievements.     MOB RULES is an altogether different beast from H&H, however. Whereas the previous record had several different shades and moods, moving confidently from the chaotic \\"Neon Knights' to the dark and mysterious \\"Lady Evil\\" to the flat-out epic title-track, the nine songs which comprise MOB RULES are snarling, ferocious devil's morsels which seethe with venomous abandon as if they were poured from a churning cauldron located just to the left of satan's doorway.    Blessed with a thunderous, incredibly-thick production courtesy of veteran knob-twiddler Martin Birch and accompanying iconic cover artwork from the Brothers Hildebrandt, MOB RULES is a staggering statement of intent which sees the Sabs ready to take on all-comers to their heavy metal throne. The album literally EXPLODES from the get-go with lead-off track \\"Turn Up The Night,\\" a speedy rocker which roars to life with a slightly deceiving cymbal-splash from kit-basher Vinnie Appice. A rollicking Iommi-riff takes center stage and threatens to eviscerate all in it's path whilst Dio howl's the lyric \\"a rumble of thunder/I'm suddenly under your spell\\" with urgency and unmatched swagger. A powerful opener which sets the stage nicely for the unstoppable auricular onslaught yet to come.      Follow-up track \\"Voodoo\\" cruises along a wicked highway of darkness courtesy of a throbbing Geezer Butler bass-line. Dio lays it on thick here atop a crunchy riff and snarls the lyric 'say you don't love me/you'll burn' with an evil finesse which was obviously in clear abundance during the tracking sessions for this record.    The album's centerpiece has to go the thundering, doom-laden 'Sign Of The Southern Cross,\\" a 7:47 musical dirge which opens slowly and gradually ascends the metal mountain of grandeur as it's many layers are slowly revealed.  Dio takes center stage with a wilting vocal painting images of 'fading away' and 'breaking crystal balls' as Iommi plucks away on soft acoustic guitar in the background. This false-sense of serenity is shattered by a sudden volley from Vinnie's drums as they rain down alarm and herald the arrival of a DOOM-LADEN power chord. The song then morphs into what it was intended to be: a harbinger of menace which smashes helpless souls unlucky enough to encounter it's all-consuming wrath.     A frenzied Iommi-solo closes the song as it fades into chaos - and chaos in this instance is the enigmatically-titled \\"E5150.\\" A mysterious soundscape consisting of eerie synths and equally dissonant guitars, \\"E5150's\\" sole reason for existence is to prepare the listener for the sonic maelstrom that is about to be unleasehed via the album's title track. Arriving as if the band were conspiring with Hade's Hordes to unleash the apocalypse, \\"Mob Rules\\" erupts like Krakatoa and cracks the sky with a PULVERIZING riff. Dio commandeers the mike and unleashes the gods of war with an absolute STUNNER of a vocal which will simultaneously whiten the hairs on the back of your neck and send small furry animals scurrying for the nearest fallout shelters. Worth the price of admission alone and an absolute CLASSIC in the annals of all of Heavy Metal.     Side Two proper see things slowed down a bit with the likes of \\"Country Girl\\" and \\"Slipping Away.\\" \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" is yet another flashy rocker on an album which acheives total dominance and never relinquishes it. Following the formula which sees a song begin with a brooding, atmospheric intro before segueing into a  bruising, oppressive heaviness and then launching into a spirited sprint via an inspired-riff, \\"Falling\\" is vintage Sabbath Mark II. Album-closer \\"Over and Over\\" showcases a more pensive Sabbath and brings things to a dramatic conclusion.          MOB RULES saw the Dio/Iommi/Butler/Appice alliance solidify and appeared destined for even further greatness. Unfortunately, petty squabbling and in-fighting between band personnel doomed any future collaborations from this line-up for the remainder of the tumultuous 1980's. That they were able to reign-in the combustible elements of their creative relationship to author two of the era's seminal LP's reflects highly of their professionalism and leaves the world of metal with an indispensable, unsurpassed collection of music.  - Ronnie Jimenez

B003NHRIVQ|2.0|The Last Song is just a sappy and a depressing film from beginning to end. Greg Kinnear is the standout performance in this film, he is a great and a solid actor but I can't say the same for teen star Miley Cyrus! Cyrus has absolutely no range or depth to take on such a serious role. The way she says her lines are completely lifeless and monotone. She puts no effort or feeling into her screen time, she brings nothing magical to The Last Song so bascially what I'm trying to say is...she ruined this drama for me!

B00002MHS1|3.0|Originally Traffic in the late 1960s released albums and singles which were often radio friendly, such as Hole In My Shoe.  John Barleycorn Must Die, from 1970, has a much more jazz feel and although the title track is an excellent folk song, I find most of the remainder not much to my taste.  If you are curious and enjoy jazz music, go for it!

B003NX6ZDC|4.0|I love this album.  I love The Killers but didn't automatically go out and get this. the initial reviews were poor and like a fool I listened to them - even though I loved Crossfire.  Only The Young came out and I wasn't fussed on it. But then I was. It reminded me of Queen. Now I love it.   Magdalena was supposed to be a good track so I sampled that. Liked it.  Went out and got the Deluxe Edition and kicked myself for not getting it earlier and letting total strangers talk me out of getting it.  Flamingo doesn't have the stadium sound that the first two Killers albums have but it's not a band album, it's solo and it's very imtimate.  The Killers Day and Age (their best in my opinion) toned the rock down a notch and Brandon's toned down even further here.  We're left with a bunch of personal songs that are catchy and dynamic.  There are Killers flavors of course but a Killers album couldn't be this heart felt.    Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas is a great sweeping opener.   Only The Young is an awesome track. It has many layers and a welcome break form the standard pop/rock fare that hits our airways.  Hard Enough doesn't do a lot for me. It's one of two weak ballads on offer  Jilted Lovers is highlight. Probably the song closest to The Killers.   Playing With Fire is the other weak track. A bit country. Does build but donesn't go far.  Was It Something I Said? is a cracker. Poppy and massively catchy.  Magdalena is a up great up tempo ballad  Crossfire is just awesome  On The Floor is a slow burning corker. Took some getting into initially but is a favorite - one of many including  Swallow It which is a another corker. (Corker is a good thing by the way if you're not used to that expression)  I feel bad for anyoe who doesn't have the Deluxe Edition because two of the four songs are just brilliant and the other two are great.  The Clock Was Tickin' took some getting into (for a non-country liker it was very off putting at first) but when you listen to the lyrics, it just hits you and hooks you in. Right Behind You reminds me of early 80's Robert Palmer and is one of the best songs on the whole album. I can't believe it was left off the initial 10 track selection. Truely brilliant song.  Jacksonville and I Came Here To Get Over You are the other two bonus track and are both worthy additions. I Came Here is a great track also. Catchy. Has a Bob Dylan vocal thing going on in the middle. Lesser so Jacksonville, which is a great bonus track but not really album worthy (given the other material here - for the majority of other artist it would be worthy).     Don't compare to The Killers (hard I know) but buy it as a stand alone release.

160459201X|5.0|A book that stretches one's view regarding the subconscious.    In this book, Dr. Murphy teaches us to train our subconscious for us to perform at our peak and to obtain the things we want out of life. I was going to write \\"easier said than done\\" but then...Is it really?    Dr. Murphy teaches us how to get along with everyone, how to live \\"lifeward\\"...infusing optimism in our daily lives.    Worth the read...But will take time to master.
B004L49K20|4.0|1. All You Need Is Now (album version) - 4 Stars<br />This feels like two songs in one. From Nick Rhodes' opening schizo synths to Simon's aggressive \\"Wild Boys\\" style vocals the song somehow morphs into a sweeping, melodic chorus that takes the song in a completely different direction. The synth then returns and drags you back into schizo-land, then back to the anthemic chorus. Somehow it all works.<br /><br />2. Blame The Machines - 3 Stars<br />Another song that feels like two songs in one. The verse and chorus seem disconnected, jumping rather suddenly from one to the other. This mixing of the beats could work, I guess. The over-dub of a female GPS control voice in the bridge is also incongruous, and the song just kind of ends. Should probably be a mid-album track rather than up front.<br /><br />3. Being Followed - 3 Stars<br />Starts off promisingly with some great lyrics by Simon about paranoia and a solid disco-rock beat. The chorus follows perfectly the first two times, then breaks down a bit in the bridge before falling completely apart at the fade with unnecessary siren effects and Simon actually singing \\"La-la-la-la-la-la-la\\" at the end. Weird, but it works.<br /><br />4. Leave a Light On - 5 Stars<br />A welcome change of pace with a beautiful ballad. This one is the closest thing on the album to \\"Save a Prayer\\". Begins with a lovely synth melody from Nick and a great lyric from Simon. \\"I know... I swear...\\" Simon croons as the chorus begins and it's compelling stuff. At only 4:23 you wish it was a minute longer to reach epic ballad status. Still, great stuff.<br /><br />5. Safe (In the Heat of the Moment) - 2 stars<br />In which the band takes a detour into rap (that worked so well on \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\") and the song completely deflates the album. A weird kind of funky tune that really goes nowhere with Ana Matronic rapping over the verse.<br /><br />6. Girl Panic! - 4 Stars<br />Could I give this a higher rating? Yeah, I could. It's not perfect, but it's damn close. A great rock song where once again Nick's synths (and lyrics!) stand out along with Simon's singing and Roger's percussive drumming. Just an up-tempo fun rock song that works perfectly from beginning to end. The only incongruity is the use of a synth solo in the bridge and fade out that was once leaked as part of a different song (\\"Pale Blue Planet\\") and sounds promising enough to stand on its own. Too bad about that part.<br /><br />7. A Diamond In The Mind - 3 Stars<br />The first of the AYNIN \\"reprises\\". A soft string melody with a slow-paced vocal overdub by Simon that's ruined a bit by inserting a vocal track from the regular track over the top.<br /><br />8. The Man Who Stole a Leopard - 3 Stars<br />This is a weird art-school song, from the \\"Tel Aviv\\" like synth opening to the \\"Chauffer\\"-like sequencer, featuring a \\"dialogue\\" between hunter (Simon) and prey (guest vocalist Kelis). The newscast voiceover at the end goes on bit too long, distracting from the song. I find this song disturbing, and I won't listen to it before bed or I'd never get to sleep. I guess that means I like it.<br /><br />9. Other People's Lives - 2 Stars<br />Sometimes there's a reason songs are left off an album. This track is a classic example of B-side material that just doesn't cut it, and quite frankly, both lyrically and musically, it's kind of embarrassing next to the quality of the other songs on the album.<br /><br />10. Mediterranea - 4 Stars<br />A slower paced number with a bit of an up-tempo chorus that would have served the main album release much better than a track like \\"Safe\\". Great lyrics and vocals again from Simon (\\"9:00am, the beach-tequila mayhem, sum of all suburban daydreams\\") with a solid rhythm and good guitar work from Dom Brown(!). Love it.<br /><br />11. Too Bad You're So Beautiful - 2 stars<br />Sometimes there's a reason songs are left off an album. Though marginally better than \\"Other People's Lives\\", this is still pretty low-quality B-Side stuff. It could be better if they cut down the time by eliminating the jarring stop-start staccato vocal bridge just before the chorus. Perhaps someone with some good editing software will do us all a favor and take those parts out, thus shortening the song from its unnecessary 5 minute running time.<br /><br />12. Runway Runaway - 3 stars<br />The album's feel-good rock/pop song equivalent of \\"Last Chance On The Stairway\\" from \\"Rio\\" Very good but simple lyrics from Simon. Just barely three minutes long then it quickly fades out. Maybe not memorable but you find yourself humming and singing along while it's playing.<br /><br />13. Return To Now - 3 Stars<br />The second reprise of AYNIN.<br /><br />14. Before the Rain - 4 stars<br />A very good closer. A slow-paced number that evokes the same spacey feel of songs like \\"Winter Marches On\\" or \\"The Chauffer\\". Great lyrics and vocal again by Simon. Love the strings at the end.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br /><br />15. Networker Nation - 3 Stars<br />B-side Material, but good B-Side material. Could be a good companion piece to \\"Blame the Machines\\" as mid-album track. Unlike \\"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\\" they keep it nice and short.<br /><br />If I were putting this album together, I'd do it like this:<br /><br />1. All You Need Is Now<br />2.

B004132HZS|5.0|I am a long time Sherlock fan, and as such I am always scared to watch a \\"remake\\" or \\"retelling\\" of a Holmes story. So, when I saw this series coming out on DVD, I wondered if I should waste my time watching a butchered version of Holmes. I am so glad I I gave it a chance.<br /><br />The series is loosely based on original stories, but set in our own time. While it takes a while to get used to Holmes using a cell phone, it was easier than I thought. The two actors who play Holmes and Watson do a brilliant job. Overall, if you enjoy Sherlock Holmes, please give this show a chance. The first DVD contains the first two episodes (over an hour each) and the second DVD contains the last. It's worth watching!

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|By Slow (Good), I mean it isn't frenetic like so many movies are today.  It's a slow starting movie, but with dialogue and preparation for the coming story - a story you will want to see to the end.  I highly recommend this film for anyone with a desire to enjoy a movie with some substance.  It has action, too.  And some good acting by some great actors.    [edit] It's even better the second time. [/edit]
0316098337|4.0|Donoghue very convincingly writes as a five-year-old whose naïvety protects him from the horrible reality of his life. The son of a sexual captive to a depraved man known only as \\"Old Nick,\\" Jack has never left the 1-room shed he calls \\"Room,\\" with only his mother for company and guidance. It is the same innocence that impedes his gradual entry into a more normal life in the outside world.<br /><br />Impeccably researched and delivered, ROOM bounces between breaking and warming your heart, leaving the reader cautiously hopeful. Most importantly, the story never feels gimmicky or insincere. You will fall in love with little Jack, and you will be better for knowing him.

B004GHBQ7O|5.0|This is Green Day at their most frantic.  Listen back to recordings from the early days and you hear a lot of the chaotic energy that drew so many of us to the band in the first place. That's been nearly 20 years ago, but the new live recordings retain a lot of that energy.  The only difference?  The band plays better together, Billie Joe's vocals are stronger, and time has given them a chance to ruminate over those early days as formative ones.  That's why it's exciting to older tracks like \\"Going to Pasalacqua\\" and \\"Who Wrote Holden Caulfield\\" alongside \\"J.A.R.\\" and \\"She.\\" This recording could have been \\"Dookie Live\\" or \\"21st Century Breakdown Live,\\" but they give us a solid mix of songs from throughout their career. Much respect.
0316017922|4.0|Dear Malcolm Gladwell,                The stories of success that you wrote about in your book, \\"Outliers\\", really assisted me to understand how time and place defines a person. That is the essential question in our English class and the purpose of it is to see the differences of people in our society. Not everyone is born in the same place at the same time. The way you talked about how culture, time, opportunity, and attitude are the key ingredients to success actually made sense to me. And the success stories are very interesting such as the 10,000 hour rule, Bill Gates's success story, and about the Asian culture.                 The 10,000 hour rule was intriguing because I didn't believe in the phrase \\"practice makes perfect\\".  Especially the story of how The Beatles's perseverance of their practices and gigs made them the idols that they are today. I know some people who have dedicated their lives to practicing instruments, and now I am anxious to see if they will reach that 10,000 hour rule. Does the attitude of practice have any effect on the 10,000 hour rule?               I always wondered how Bill Gates became so rich and successful and now I know. Sure he was smart from a young age, but he also had the opportunity to access computers to practice for 10,000 hours. I agree that he was very dedicated and very lucky that he got the chance to practice on computers without any restrictions. Was Bill Gates a genius from the start because he was able to program at the age of 8?               When you talked about the Asian society, I related how it was very similar to my life. I didn't think about how the Asian numerical language was simpler and  I thought about it and realized you were right. I never guess that that was why I excelled in math during my middle and high school years. When you wrote about how the Asian culture looks at hard work as the way of success, I recognized that right away. My parents who are deeply rooted into the Asian viewpoint of success always tell me to work hard so I apprehend what you wrote about.                Your book \\"Outliers\\" was very interesting and was comfortable to read because I was able to relate to it in some way. What you wrote about made sense and the stories you shared weren't boring. It helped in my class to see that time and place does define a person, whether he or she is successful or not.

014241543X|5.0|What if everything was taken away from you in an instant? What would you do if the choice to go on was left up to you?<br /><br />Would you stay? Or would you leave?<br /><br />Could you leave behind those you love? Could you go on in the absence of those you've lost?<br /><br />What would it take to make you stay?<br /><br />***<br /><br />If I Stay is a delicately beautiful, deeply moving and devastatingly heartbreaking story about a girl who is faced with the difficult decision of what to do after being involved in a horrific accident.<br /><br />Mia, whose life hangs in the balance, must choose whether to fight for life or slip away. Neither choice is simple. Neither without pain. Neither without loss. And no matter which choice she makes, she will have to say goodbye.<br /><br />Her decision will require a maturity and strength not easily found under such terrible circumstances or by someone as young as she. She should never have had to learn the harsh lessons of life at her age, been forced to make such a difficult decision or bear witness to the things she has seen and heard.<br /><br />\\"I realize now that dying is easy. Living is hard.\\"<br /><br />Author Gayle Forman has created such a fragile and heartrending story that cannot help but touch everyone who reads it. If I Stay will have readers asking themselves what they would do if they had the power over their own life and death.<br /><br />As tragic as this story is, there are bright spots throughout as Mia looks back at key moments in her life. These glances through the window at her life before show readers where she comes from, what she has to lose if she leaves, and what she has lost if she stays.<br /><br />This book will stay with you for a long time. It will turn you inside out, leave you very aware of just how tenuous the balance is between life and death and make you take a long look at just what you might have to lose if you were in Mia's shoes.
0316098337|1.0|I have an appreciation for all types of books, but this book was one of the worst I have ever read.  I listened to this book rather than read the print version and I was sickened by the voice of the consistently annoying \\"Jack.\\"  Perhaps that had something to do with my intense dislike of it but I think it had more to do with the poor plot and character development, irritating main characters, and many obvious contradictions.  For example, Jack's speech - sometimes he was extremely, if not bizarrely, well-spoken for a 5 year old with an expansive vocabulary - but then at other times he talked like a 2 year old.  That made no sense at all.  Also, the whole escape and rescue was completely unrealistic.  I can't imagine if Old Nick was the monster he was that kidnapped a girl and imprisoned both her and ultimately her son for so many years that he would suddenly feel bad for the girl and take her word for it that Jack was dead and would not have checked it for himself - ridiculous.  The over-inclusion of information about breastfeeding and \\"having some\\" made me have to repeatedly shut off the CD.  I understand that being in \\"room\\" and having limited resources, breastfeeding was MAYBE a necessary thing (although, there were mentions of vegetables, broccoli, green beans, etc.), but the constant references to it were unnerving, especially Jack's unnatural cravings for it and his characterizations of it as \\"creamy.\\"  It was vulgar and revolting.  Now, I know that Jack's attachment to \\"having some\\" was probably meant to be more of a comfort thing rather than a nourishment issue, but quite honestly, that made it worse for me. Jack knew nothing of the world outside, nor did he know what he was missing outside of \\"room,\\" so there was really nothing that required Jack being comforted.  This is especially true since his mother (his constant source of comfort) was with him for every second of every day of his life.  I was terrifically uncomfortable when, THANK GOODNESS for smallfavors, Jack was weaned and he kissed each of his mother's breasts as his fond farewell.  And, just to top off the list of annoyances, WHY did Jack describe nearly EVERYTHING with the word \\"bits??\\"  I can't even get into the tooth sucking nonsense.  I was absolutely thrilled that he lost that tooth.  If the author's intent was to make Jack's character, dialogue and actions endearing, she failed miserably.  He was, without a shred of doubt, one of the most irritating fictional characters I can ever recall.  I was physically relieved when I finished this book and will be sure to avoid any of Ms. Donoghue's past or future undertakings.

0393338827|4.0|The Big Short by Michael Lewis is one of the smartest books I ever read and it rarely meanders. This short history is a careful explanation of an occurrence that was fraught with extremely complicated financial and mathematical models. If you come away feeling like you still don't fully understand credit default swaps and consolidated debt obligations, then you're not alone. (I still don't.) Part of the truth is they were mostly designed to be complicated, and another part is Wall Street was searching for even more creative ways of creating wealth from nothing.<br /><br />It's almost too simplistic to reduce the sub-prime mortgage crisis down to simple explanations such as greed, being uninformed, targeting the lower middle class, fraud, lack of regulation or even a simple loss of values. The truth is much more complicated. I was most intrigued to peer into the daily lives of the types of people who inhabit the Wall Street culture. It seems most of them aren't driven primarily by greed, though need for unbelievable sums of money does play a significant role. It's like they see the financial markets as a game and they want to play, and given this culture possesses the raw power to move and shake the world, it's natural for ambitious people to want to be included.<br /><br />Read this book if you're looking for why the sub-prime mortgage crisis happened. The answer is both routinely boring and really, really frightening.

Ah well, what do you expect from a DVD region system that places China and the US in the same camp, but Britain in with the French, Germans, and every other language that isn't English, other than the Asian ones.. And, none of them are being sold in region 0 either... Absurd, really.    Still, got to love Rincewind.

B004DSX5B6|3.0|For the money, this is a decent multitool. Upfront, the Philips Head screwdriver blows and the other screw drivers are not very well executed. I like the spring-loaded pliers and the innovative fold out scissor design, but I can't recommended this product fully. The carry pouch has a design flaw in that it contains an additional inside pocket. Every time you attempt to holster the device it gets caught on the other pocket hampering insertion. Not good. May be good for including in your car's First Aid kit, but you'll not use it as your primary MultiTool.

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is a novel written by the Brazilian author, Paulo Coelho. The book trails the story of a young shepherd named Santiago who travels to Egypt in search of his personal legend.   The book begins with a dream, which sends young Santiago on a journey, following his heart and signs given to him. Before heading out on his journey to find his personal legend, his father leaves him with one line of advice, \\"Travel the world until you see that our castle is the greatest, and our women the most beautiful\\".    On his adventure Santiago meets many different people, finding love, new opportunities and unforeseen danger. As he travels he begins to realize the impact he is having on others lives and the place others have served in his own. As he struggles to find what he is looking for he realizes that \\"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\\"     Throughout the novel, Santiago gains experience and meets many important people. However, by the end he realizes that what he had originally been looking for may not really be what he was truly seeking.  He understands that treasure isn't something you find in any place, amount of money or in everlasting life, \\"treasure lies where your heart belongs\\".    The Alchemist is an uplifting novel, inspiring readers to work to achieve their dreams. It loudly proclaims the idea that if you truly want something, then you can do the impossible. It shatters the idea that we have no control over our own destinies and that life can do with us what it pleases.     Coelho was also able to tie religion into this novel by explaining that by searching for our personal legends we are in fact searching for God.  As we work toward being our best selves we are able to become closer to God.    The Alchemist is a fantastic book that connects with people from every age group and every background. The reader can easily identify with Santiago's pursuit of his personal legend, because we all have dreams. Thisbook tells readers that when you come to a crossroads in life where we can decide to forget or to realize your dreams, it is always worth pursuing them, because while in the pursuit of your dreams we will find ourselves.

0061537969|5.0|This is really a beautiful book. The whole story is told by Enzo, a dog, and he's truly eloquent. His words moved in me all kinds of emotions, from sadness (he even made me cry at the beginning and end), joy, laughter, anger, what not! He shows of the pretty and ugly sides of us humans, how we can be loving, caring and tender, as well as deceiving, vengeful, manipulative, liars, etc. His protector (I don't like much the word owner for animal companions), Denny, is a race car driver. And it's really interesting how Enzo learns stuff about life through the racing abilities and experience of Denny. He enjoys Denny's racing and watches videos of his races over and over again. Racing in the rain is no easy task, and sometimes in life when it rains it pours. Denny's life turns into a race against all odds, and even with dampen spirits he never gives up and gives a fight. He has the spirit of a true champion. I don't want to give away many details, because I would take out what makes it wonderful. All I can say is that it's a very enjoyable book. A page turner indeed.

B0016BPWNM|5.0|... I was so excited when I found out that Amazon carried this movie.  My daughter who is now 21 used to watch this movie over and over and over from the time she was 2 until she turned 6 and the film strip of the VHS tape popped.  She was so heart broken that she slept with it under her pillow for so long that I forgot she had it until we moved when she was 8.  Needless to say that over that long of a period of time I learned the movie word for word forwards and backwards songs and all.  I fell in love with the movie and was just as sad as she was when we could no longer watch it.<br /><br />When I got it in the mail I surprised her by taking a picture of it with my cell phone, and sending it to her with no comments written in.  She called me screaming with excitement from college, and now all she talks about is how we are going to watch it every single night while curled up on the couch together when she comes home for the summer.  IT IS BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING AND WONDERFUL MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!!!<br /><br />This movie will capture your child's imagination, and it will keep them captivated as they get to know every character.  Once they are old enough to understand the movie they will learn a few valuable lessons about how life is not \\"all about them\\" and they will pass it on to their own children for just that reason!<br /><br />BUY THIS MOVIE FOR YOUR LITTLE ONES AND WATCH IT WITH THEM!!!!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|After reading many reviews, (like most of us) before making a decision on what Bluetooth device to buy for my mobile phone, I ultimately decided to go with the Plantronics Voyager PRO. Even though it came out in 2009/2010. And I'm very glad I did. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I couldn't be happier. I had thought about going with the latest Plantronics model, but realized I just wanted a good reliable, easy to use model that was less money upfront. I paid $45.00, plus 10.00 more for a carrying case. It was totally worth it. I even wear glasses, and have no problem with the comfort factor. Great product, and great service from AMAZON.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is a brilliant work of fiction with a very unique style and voice.  Set in Nazi Germany, the narrator \\"Death\\" tells the story of Liesel, a young German girl with a penchant for reading and stealing books.  While the young adult genre may seem flooded with Holocaust books, Zusak's \\"BOOK THIEF\\" sets itself apart with a highly original and compelling plot. The character development is outstanding-- readers will find themselves deeply attached to the entire cast by the novel's conclusion.<br /><br />No need for plotline spoilers! Just pick up the book, you won't be disappointed! Overall: A+

1439181780|5.0|Whether you read it here or elsewhere, it works.  The Secret worked for me and The Power is a great reminder and continues to inspire with new discussion, analogies and information.  I've heard it before that its all a scam or craziness, this proves to me yet again, its so much easier to be negative rather than positive.  My advice is, why not try it!?   At the worst, you'll see little change in your life.  At the very best, you'll be a much more loving person and discover happiness in the most amazing places.  Get it at the library or borrow it from a friend if you are skeptical. The changes in your life will be subtle.  Suddenly the person who always seemed to take your spot in the crowded deli counter is nowhere to be seen; the Starbucks line won't be quite as long when you're in a rush, your workday will be a little less hectic, your boss is not quite as tyrannical.  All of these things are small subtle changes, but create an amazing life when added all together.

1401310400|3.0|This is a spin-off of the Castle TV series, which is about a crime writer following a homocide detective and helping to solve her cases. In the series, novelist Richard Castle tells detective Kate Beckett he is writing a book based on her, about a cop named Nikki Storm. \\"Sounds like a stripper\\" says Beckett. This is that book, a parody on tough guy crime novels. Nikki Storm is followed by journalist Jameson Rook, who closely resembles Castle.    The parody writing style is over the top, but if you ignore it, there's a plot there that is worth following.     One thing that did bother me is the Swedish nanny had a name that is positively Victorian, a name no one would have today. And the couple of Swedish words she's quoted as saying look like someone just looked them up in an English-Swedish dictionary. They don't really work as Swedish.    But if you like Castle, this is a fun complement.
0756405890|5.0|This book was fantastic but like everything, not everyone is going to like it.  There are no dwarves, elves, magic staffs, or some epic quest to save the universe in this book.  To put it bluntly this is not your typical fantasy book.  I would be hard pressed to even lump it in with the rest of fantasy novels out there as those are all similar in some way.  This is a personal story with adventure thrown in.     That's what makes this book shine in my opinion.  Told in a first person point of view, this imaginary world had a sense of realism about it.  You can almost imagine this land exists in another part of our world instead of something made up.  The author put a lot of thought into how everything works like religion and currency, for example, without boring you with the details.  Even the magic, if you can call it that, is more of a science albeit a fictional one.    I give Patrick Rothfuss a lot of credit.  To write a first person story about someones life is not easy. You have to make this character one the most interesting people we have ever met if you want us to keep reading about him.  He accomplished this and then some.     Everything about this book was a pleasant surprise and an enjoyable read.  He set the bar very high with the next two in the series.
1594202842|1.0|I normally don't bother spending time writing book reviews online, but this book so wrongly portraits a \\"typical\\" Chinese mother that I have to sit down and write a few lines. I'm a Chinese mother who immigrated to this country 20+ years ago and I know no Chinese mothers as crazy as this author. This book is all about bragging her and her family's superiority, her worship of fame, and her shocking cruelty toward her children. I wonder how many of the descriptions in the book are exaggerated scenes intending to shock and make money (the author herself admitted in the book that she likes to exaggerate and envies some successful Chinese American writers); otherwise I don't understand how the apparently sane husband can even stand her, not to mention the poor kids! This book leaves you with nothing at the end but a strong sense of disgust... Don't read it - not worth your time and money!!!

B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like the game, don't get me wrong, but who the hell thought it was a good idea to restrict it so that we in Europe can't get it from the app store? And why do I have to go through the entire setup process, including my credit card data before they tell me that the whole store is unavailable in my region?    Enough about that. This game rocks. After the initial Angry Birds version I was a little disappointed at the seasons-version. It was more of the same and I was a little put off by the whole experience. Now Rio has come out and it is a big improvement. I don't know if it is Froyo on my Milestone or the new and improved graphics, but the game runs much more smoothly (could also be the lack of ads in my hacked apk?). The game has depth to it, much better than the 2D experience you would get in previous versions.

0385341008|2.0|Although the premise of this story is very solid, the letter writing format for me was confusing and frustrating.  I found it very difficult to keep so many characters straight plus a tryst between Juliet and the American man.  Also, it was unrealistic in that every letter writer had the exact same style, spelling and lexicon. They appeared to be all written by the same person.  Even what should have been conversations were presented in this fashion. What I hoped would be a good historical read turned out to be a disappointing randomly grouped collection of letters.  I put it down after the first 100 pp.
B004L49K20|4.0|Finally an album from DD that's cut from the same cloth as Rio.  Just a great sounding album.  I agree with other reviewers that say the album is solid the whole way through. But I don't think every song is a 4 or 5.  That's why I can't give this a five-star rating. But this is a very very good album. Standouts for me are the title track, Other People's Lives, Too Bad You're So Beautiful and Runway Runaway.  But even in the other songs, the creativity, sound and performance carry them all the way through.  The album really does fit very nicely right next to Rio in the playlist.
0316098337|4.0|\\"Room\\" is narrated by 5-year-old Jack, a precocious child who is confined to a room with his Ma.  I usually am a slow reader but I raced through Jack's story.  Though it is gripping and well written, it was my anxiety for Jack that compelled me onward.  Although I often get engaged in the novels I read, \\"Room\\" made me care enough about Jack that I worried about him even when I'd set the book aside.    To me (and I can see from the posts that people are split on this issue) Jack is an engaging -- no, a loveable -- and an utterly credible voice.  He is strong, intelligent and innocent; and, with the faith of a child, he believes absolutely in the world as his mother presents it to him.  I don't doubt for a moment that Emma Donoghue has children, and probably has had experience dealing with this age group in particular.  Despite his intelligence, his inexperience and his immaturity make him unable to understand much about his situation.  Thus, he's not so much an unreliable narrator as a limited one.  Donoghue enables her readers to see Jack's world through his eyes but, as adults, to understand those parts of it which are beyond Jack's capacity.  As a fledgling writer, I know how hard it is both to create a realistic child's voice and to create an unreliable narrator.  I'm very impressed by her deftness in achieving both of these feats.    \\"Room\\" is an impressive book and I recommend it highly.  Despite its strengths, however, I am giving it four stars (four-plus, really) for a few reasons.  For one, I felt that the novel rushed too quickly to its ending, and as a result the ending felt a bit contrived.  For another, after I'd finished the book and thought about it, I felt that to some extent Donoghue manipulates the story throughout.  That is, certain things seem to happen primarily so that Donoghue can stick to her predetermined sequence of events.

0525951652|5.0|After reading both Pillars and WWE I knew I had to pick up another Follett novel.  I am not a history buff, so needless to say I was a bit hesitant to start reading Fall of Giants.  Despite my doubts, however, I jumped the gun and bought this book anyway.  After reading the first few pages, I was hooked!  The way Follett is able to deliver a great book based on a subject that I would otherwise find boring and dull is amazing.  All in all, I highly recommend it.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album is so incredibly beautiful. Adele takes her vocal abilities to a whole new level that was already amazing to begin with. Rolling In The Deep, Rumor Has It, Turning Tables, Someone Like You, I'm only naming the songs I already know the words to after a week with the album haha. It's a great mix of catchy tunes, with touching songs that make you reminisce on old flames. LOVE 21! Adele has done it again. :)
B003Y5H55G|3.0|Forgive me if this sounds a lot like the Roger Ebert review but honestly it appears we had a near identical reaction to the movie. Paul is an alright movie. It's fun to watch Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together. It's well shot and a good movie to see in theaters, especially with friends, which is what I did. The idea of an RV road trip works well theatrically but also feels a little underwhelming at times because the movie seems not to have enough ideas. As Ebert pointed out, the ComicCon stuff is pretty funny. The film is very confident in that area and would have been better if it stayed with material it was completely comfortable with. Instead, they bring in an alien character, who has a good introduction and some promise since Seth Rogan is involved but never really takes off. I'm 100% with Ebert that the alien is too ordinary, and watching the movie I kept thinking \\"are they going to do anything different with it than it being Seth Rogan? This is pretty human for an alien.\\" So the movie has a premise, but doesn't make much progress. It's almost a good movie, and maybe one more rewrite would have done the trick. Just a little more imagination into the alien character. What's there is good, but it won't bowl you over.  It serves this movie to have been a miss, they ripped off made-for-TV-USA-original-movie Beer Money! At least I was amused by the similarities. The performances are solid. I watched some making-of feature and the cast looked like they were having a ton of fun. Sigourney Weaver is always welcome, and I was delighted to hear Steven Spielberg.  2 and a 1/2 out of 4

B004KA9MQO|5.0|When I first heard of Jennifer Hudson, it was for the promotion of Dream Girls. I wasn't too keen on her because I thought the woman was overrated and sounded like every other powerhouse R&B singer. I did enjoy her performance in Dream Girls, but I didn't like her overshadowing my girl \\"B\\" lol. I really liked her performance \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" and even clapped in the audience along with everyone else. However, I never really cared about her career because I'm not the type who jumps on an artist's bandwagon because of the praise they get from the media. I see that as following the crowd and letting someone be overrated. I like to be the judge of that myself. Then my love of music has gotten the best of me. So recently I checked out the samples and ended up loving them. After downloading the album, I've been blasting \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"No One Gonna Love You\\". I can't believe I judged this woman as some pretentious diva. She really does have an astounding voice and is considered one of my new favorite artists. This is the first album by her I heard, but it's a great album. This album is good for people who love \\"old school\\", throwback to the 90's, or just plain good music.<br /><br />Tracks You Should Check Out:<br />1. Don't Look Back<br />2. No One Gonna Love You<br />3. I Got This<br />4. Where You At<br />5.

0312370849|1.0|I am glad many people love this book as it is worth reading. However, if you are a mother of small children, particularly emotionallly sensitive, or both, do not read it.

0812974611|5.0|The book is based over 4 days leading up to the roman town pompeii and other surrounding towns get covered by the volcano, vesuvius. The Lead character has been sent from rome to deal with the aquaduct which has dried up and to replace the previous engineer who was looking after it goes missing. The story follows the aquaduct engineer well tries to fix it and try to find out why his predecessor goes missing. It also follows 3 other character who the engineer comes across, which are a freeman who owns a lot off the town and is corrupt, as well as a young lady who is his daughter and a elderly scientist (for the people into roman history is Pliny the Elder). The book is very well written and keeps intrested all the way through. It brings the ancient city of pompeii and surrounding area alive and puts a real touch to it. It involves real people, places and other information found in pompeii into the story. It is a brilliant read for people into history and not into history alike.
0756404738|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear is amazing. He is clever, passionate and has a great sense of humor. I enjoyed reading the original characters' development and meeting new ones.  It is a great book of three parts. I found myself pausing and re-reading passages or phrases. Patrick Rothfuss's writing is a pleasure to read. His comedy is as perfectly done as his emotional heart-breaking tragedy. The great plotting and timing and somehow turning the improbable into possible kept me fascinated throughout. This is sheer fun and entertainment that will keep your anxiety at a peek until number three is out.

B004LGPBZI|4.0|Honestly, who thought that Oasis would survive without songwriter extraordinaire and sometimes singer Noel Gallagher?  The Rain, the predecessor to Oasis founded by Liam, wasn't going anywhere until Noel walked in and took over.      But those of us with an appreciation for music as it is (not worrying about slams borne by journalistic frustration over their own failed music careers) had a different perspective.    This is a band with quite a bit of firepower.  You have Liam Gallagher, the greatest singer of his generation.  Someone who, if he just went for it, has the genetic code for writing decent songs.  Ignore his bombast and his persona -- he's a rock star and he's all in on that.  Love him or hate him, though, you have to recognize his talent.  All things being equal, his vocal performances have defined a generation.  The mid to late 90s do not exist the same without Liam Gallagher.  Andy Bell is an underrated talent.  For Liam & Co, this was a good thing, because as Oasis, the band was able to snap him up before he joined UK somewhat-knowns Gay Dad.  But Bell has had a very, very successful career -- as co-leader (co-singer, co-songwriter, lead guitar) of Oxford's finest band Ride (Radiohead fans: too bad).  Ride burst onto the scene in 1989 and helped change music with their 'shoegaze' sound that always seemed to be more layered, deeper, and more intelligent than the moniker suggested.  Their sound grew and changed with each record, something the UK press didn't get, and they broke up in 1996.  Bell's solo vehicle, Hurricane #1, had several tremendous hits, including one song ending up in an advert -- ahead of its time, the UK press slagged them for that.  They broke up for good as well.  But in Andy Bell, you have a lead guitar who is as accomplished as anyone in the UK, and a songwriter (and decent singer) who has written several top 10 songs.  Gem Archer, former singer/songwriter of Heavy Stereo, isn't too shabby either -- you have a guy who can do 70sglam as well as anyone not named Manic Street Preachers.  And Chris Sharrock knows a thing or two about success.  The Las' 'Here She Goes' is as recognizable as any britpop song.    But all of that would be for naught if there weren't SONGS.  You can have great musicians, you can have great musical ideas executed, but if the songs aren't there, we can move on.  And this is where detractors feared Beady Eye would fall short.  Could this \\"ragtag group\\" of non-Noels write songs?     Yes.    The detractors and Noel fanatics will tell you that this is crap.  They will tell you that The Roller is derivative of 100 songs (most citing John Lennon's Instant Karma).  They will go on and on about stuff that simply does not matter.      Oasis had a lot of derivative riffs and musical ideas.  They were even sued for it.  But, folks, any musician will tell you this is how music works.  There are no copyrights on chord progressions; there are no patents on key signatures.  You learn by sitting at the feet of your heroes, playing their songs, over and over, and you eventually start branching out.  Your stuff will likely be similar to that which you love.  Homages to your heroes is not theft; none of these songs are out and out copies.  There is no plagiarism here.  I suspect those using that tired canard are not musicians themselves.  They don't get it.    The songs here are not Oasis songs.  You want big stadium guitar hero stuff, look elsewhere.  These are excellent songs.  They groove.  They swing.  They stomp.  They ... make you put yer arm around yer mate and have it.  But it is curiously and refreshingly a new thing.  A thing that certainly includes Liam's love of the Beatles and Bell's love of the late 60s/70s rock and Gem's glam.  Put it in a blender and you have -- Beady Eye.  A harkening to the classics for sure, but a good one.      Song by song, this is a listenable album straight through, and that's unusual these days.  Not every song is a hit.  Not every song is even5-star.  I'm giving the record 4 stars because that's what it is - an excellent debut from an accomplished set of musicians still sorting out their new arrangement.  Some songs on here are merely good; but almost every song on this record has SOMETHING to recommend it.      Highlights include Four Letter Word, Millionaire, The Roller, Wigwam, The Beat Goes On, and The Morning Son.      Highly recommended for any fan of \\"Britrock\\" and great rock and roll.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Wow! What a great story, couldn't put it down.  Being a dog lover this book helps us see things from the views of what our pets just may see and feel.  Makes you wonder.

B004SKHJF2|4.0|So far so good no issues yet I've always preferred this over soundhorn ..was very upset when they made unlimited a paid app but thanks to amazon its free!
B004SKHJF2|3.0|I was using SoundHound free on an Android 2.2 device before this was offered free. However, since Shazam Encore is free today, I have purchased and installed it and after using it for a little bit, I think I am going to stick with SoundHound.<br /><br />There aren't major advantages to either app that warrants anyone to pass up on this free-for-today app but I would find it hardly worth the $5 price tag. I found that both SoundHound and Shazam performed similarly, finding and missing the same songs on my very mixed library. I even tried it on some live recordings and both programs were only decent when trying to find it.<br /><br />I find that SoundHound returns results after a briefer listening time to the music than Shazam. After listening for only a couple of seconds, SoundHound has already finished listening while Shazam insists on listening to a set amount of time. Another initial quirk was that Shazam didn't seem to indicate the whether the phone was actually picking up any audio but I have realized that the meter actually indicates changes in the level of sound. Still, I think the audio level indicator for SoundHound is much clearer.<br /><br />The information that is returned is also more accurate. Both apps do an admirable job at returning the song title and artist but Shazam has this peculiar quirk where it assigns the song to albums that I would not normally associate with the song. Examples include: Coldplay's \\"What If\\" which I expect the album \\"X&Y\\" but returns \\"What the World Needs Now\\"; Sufjan Steven's \\"Chicago\\" from \\"Illinois\\" but Shazam returns \\"Folk Routes\\". These are issues that I didn't have with SoundHound.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that it is good to add this to your library (since it is free today, 3.25.2011) even if it isn't installed in case SoundHound drops in quality or Shazam increases. My recommendation, if you had to spend $5 on a music tagging app, would lean towards SoundHound if the free app is any indication of paid app.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This production is fantastic!  About as true to the original staging in a concert version.  The lighting far exceeded anything done in the US.

The appearances of some of the original cast and an encore including 4 'Valjeans' made this very special.

0061726826|5.0|When Lena's story begins, you know that she's devoted to the cure. She wants nothing more than to avoid the delirium that comes with falling in love. Deliria Nervosa is nothing to laugh at. It's victims lose their minds, make decisions that are unsafe and continually put their own lives in danger. Lena's own family is tainted with those who have succumbed to the disease and she's counting down the days until she will no longer have to worry.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver does an impeccable job of sucking you into this world where love is not only forbidden but the worst thing that can happen to a person. There are handbooks and rules to follow. The Book of Shhh clearly outlines the symptoms of Deliria Nervosa so that you can be prepared if you or someone you know is in danger. The world Lena lives in is carefully protected and it's obvious that anyone who tries to escape the regulators will not make it far.<br /><br />When Lena's best friend, Hana, reveals that there is an underground world of people who are defying the Book of Shhh and the regulators, Lena only knows that she must stop Hana. She can't let her best friend get caught when the end of their worries of catching Deliria is so near. But when Lena tries to stop Hana, she meets Alex and her whole world is turned upside down.<br /><br />There just aren't enough words to describe how much I loved this book. I loved every aspect of it - the lovable, real characters; the incredibly poignant plot; Lena's heartbreaking family history; Alex - honestly, everything. For Delirium, I wish I could give this book MORE than our highest rating. It was that good. Loved, loved, loved this book! If I could give this six or seven or even ten stars I would. Pick this book up today, if you haven't already!
0061020680|5.0|Mort is the fourth novel in the Discworld series, and the first in the Death storyline. This story introduces Death as a main character. The Discworld's Death is not exactly like the commonly through of figure of Death. Yes, he wears black and carries a scythe, but he is a very different character. This Death goes along and does his job with a sense of purpose, not enjoyment or greed. He also likes cats, a lot.<br /><br />Mort is the protagonist of the story, and is a child growing up without very much purpose or direction. Which leads his father to bring him to a job fair, at which he is hired by Death. The story then becomes about Mort growing up and going through the various aspects of growing up and dealing with the mental aspects of being Death's apprentice. It is a very interesting comparison to view Death and Mort performing the same duties side-by-side and watching their reactions and their through process.<br /><br />Mort is one of the best Discworld novels. It contains all of the great Terry Pratchett humor that everyone expects from him and also delivers one of his better stories. The story is fast paced and has all of the good makings of a coming-of-age story told with a really interesting spin.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|A big shout-out to L. Padgett for the fix (see reviews), only correction here is to find your device in 'My Computer' Drive E (in Windows XP, anyway, probably varies for other Windows types), not in explorer or any other browser.<br /><br />That being said, this is a pretty game that stays true to the Angry Birds straightforward style of play, and if you got it free like I did through Amazon, no ads!  Hooray!<br /><br />Definitely glad I took the 5 min. to fix the install problem; definitely worth playing if you're a Birdwatcher (nyuk nyuk, ugh).

B004SBS8LA|4.0|This was my first attempt at the \\"angry birds\\" series.  As a longtime Amazon customer, I have no problem signing on for the long haul (where others seem to complain about this).<br /><br />The graphics are gorgeous on my DroidX, gameplay is smooth and responsive to slight touches on the screen.<br />This is a very enjoyable take on the old ( projectile+parabolic trajectory+target ) game format.<br /><br />I did not find any instructions.. maybe because this is the 3rd or so in a series, they figure everybody knows how to play already.  The game was pretty intuitive, but it took me a few rounds to figure out that the different birds had different abilities.<br />A tutorial, demo, or instruction e-booklet would be a nice option (and later uninstallable for space conservation).<br /><br />Also, I see that after finishing the first two 'levels', there are place holders for upcoming releases on a calendar schedule.  I wonder if they will be free, or a paid add-on.  If so, that makes this \\"free\\" version more like a free trial where I only get the first levels, but need to pay for the rest.<br /><br />Still - as a free game, from a trusted source like Amazon, I have very little to complain about.

The defining aspect of a MacGuffin is that the major players in the story are (at least initially) willing to do and sacrifice almost anything to obtain it, regardless of what the MacGuffin actually is. In fact, the specific nature of the MacGuffin may be ambiguous, undefined, generic, left open to interpretation or otherwise completely unimportant to the plot. Common examples are money, victory, glory, survival, a source of power, or a potential threat, or it may simply be something entirely unexplained.<br /><br />Yeah, in context this MacGuffin was entirely unexplained.  I won't tell you who done it, but that so many would risk so much for so little is comical.  And yet, the pace of the story is so good, one forgets.  Just ignore that man behind the screen.
B001AQO400|5.0|My days of owning physical discs are over, but I couldn't resist but pick up one of my favorite films in HD. Scarlett looks jaw dropping beautiful in 1080p. So does Japan.     Murray should have won the Oscar over Penn for his performance, in my opinion. One of the best films of the 2000's.
B003Y5H5JM|5.0|Let me say right off: I am a total Bardolator.  I teach Shakespeare, I am obsessed with Shakespeare, I have read and seen all the plays, and my love affair with the Bard began with seeing a live performance of The Tempest in 1975.  It was pure magic.  I also love movies, and I believe that in the 21st century, filmed versions of Shakespeare's plays are probably the best way to reach the widest audience.  The sneers and sniffs of snobs aside, I am convinced that if Will were alive today, he'd be writing movie screenplays (or even television), NOT stage plays, which today are aimed at a narrow, elite, theatre-going audience.<br /><br />As a literature professor who has been teaching The Tempest for a decade now, I have always been singularly bemused by the lack of a filmed version that really captures the magical spirit of the play.  The old TV Richard Burton show is well-acted but silly, the BBC version has great actors but terrible, flat production values, Prospero's Books is brilliant but incomprehensible to all but those who know the play intimately, Derek Jarman's version is terribly dated and, despite being a good &#34;film,&#34; just doesn't work as The Tempest, in my opinion.  The other, &#34;scholastic&#34; releases are plagued by poor production and/or undistinguished acting. And I won't even bother with &#34;adaptations&#34; of the plot, such as Forbidden Planet or Cassavettes's Tempest.<br /><br />Until this version, the only truly excellent version of The Tempest was the HBO animated one, but at 25 minutes, not much of Shakespeare's story remained intact.<br /><br />Just last week I had the great pleasure of seeing Julie Taymor's The Tempest in London.  It was absolutely amazing.  The magic was there!  The acting, for the most part, was brilliant.  The script contained enough of the actual play's language that the minor tweakings to make it easier for contemporary audiences did not bother me a bit.  The visuals were absolutely stunning.  The movie was a joy from start to finish.  I can't wait to see it again--repeatedly--to savor all the special moments over and again.  My only regret is that my students will be unable to see it this year due to the late release date.<br /><br />[REVISION NOTE: This year's students had the opportunity to see this version, and they overwhelmingly LOVED it.  It brought the play to life for them.  At last, I no longer have to convince them that The Tempest really IS a great play! 01/19/12]<br /><br />If you love Shakespeare, and if you enjoy movie adaptations of the plays, DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!oy from start to finish.

I found the watch fairly easy to navigate and amazingly accurate.  It's a great motivational tool.  I even use it with the heart rate moniter when I'm on the treadmill.  I don't have the foot pod so it doesn't record my distance but the heart rate read out is really useful in my run.    great product.

B004C389A4|5.0|Follett's engaging presentation of history through the lives of fascinating characters, is an enjoyable treat.   Read by an ingenious talent, John Lee, who puts a face on each of these players, this audiobook is a theatrical gift.    Today's youth, who could care less about how their futures have been usurped by the corruption and greed abundantly documented in Charles Ferguson's \\"Inside Job\\", will see that it's an old story.  This history lesson not only informs them of the rape of information by Britain's WW I press as contrasted with America's (at the time) responsible journalism, and how this sludge has made it to the Me, Me, Me talking Heads we see today (Thank you, Stephen Colbert, for satirizing the bullshi+ so we can see the forest for the trees), but also gives our youth the opportunity to see another example of how ill-informed people constantly allow themselves to be herded where the less intellectually equipped .5% want to take us for their own self-centered purposes.  But in this story, it's not just about money & greed, as today's economic meltdown is, but the reprehensible pomposity of self-aggrandizing elites, so blinded by the perceived but non-existent sparkle of their own egos they can't find their own presence in a moment of time, that they perpetrated one of the greatest injuries on the psyche of the Earth with the slaughter of millions.  All this, at the hands of these \\"leaders\\" with imaginary intellects - so capably presented by Follet and Lee.    Children of the Earth need to learn what their true inheritance is; get off their damned phones; and T H I N K.      True knowledge will eventually become available only through stillness - stillnesses such as those following John Lee's scenes presenting the issues of that time (and this) in so evocative a manner as to show our youth there are gushing Fountains of Real Information spouting \\"photographs\\" of life on a continuum that can't be found on FB, Twitter, or FOX - photographs of themselves in the guises of their grandparents, parents, and even their own children, unless they find their own awareness and learn to expand it.    If one can \\"read between the lines\\", one can also hear the universe within John Lee's silences.    Follett has shown us an ounce of the treachery perpetrated on mankind; has shown us how to more ably protect ourselves from it; and John Lee's genius has brought these lessons into another experiential and emotional dimension.    Amazing.

B004GHIHD0|5.0|Having been a huge Claudia Brucken fan since 1984's Propaganda this is a perfect collection of her with Propaganda, Act, OneTwo, solo and rare stuff.  The two new songs 'Thank You' (which has an awesome video on youtube) and Night School are both a wonderful addition to this album.  Also the song with Susanna Freytag (Another ex-Propaganda member) is incredible.

B003YP7N9O|3.0|Note: three star rating is for this 3-disc CD reissue. Original album rates 10 stars.    Stand Up is quite possibly my favorite, non-Beatles rock album, and I have about 3,000 in my collection to choose from. It's status is bolstered by my having seen Tull right at this time in a little, short-lived music hall in Denver -- Mammoth Gardens -- which also  ranks as one of my favorite concerts of all time. There was nothing like seeing Ian Anderson in is his duster coated, whirling dervish days. All too soon his stage mannerisms would become rote. But in those early days, he was the finest rock showman on any stage.     I have bought three previous CDs of Stand Up to supplement my original vinyl record (itself probably having replaced two worn-out LPs), but I will probably take a pass on this CD. As others have stated, virtually all of the bonus material will already be in the collections of Tull collectors. I want to thank the posters of reviews who made it clear that the DVD is a sound-only DVD, which repeats the music of the second, audio CD. The top two reviews on Amazon pretty well hid that fact, and it would have been only for the DVD that I would have bought it yet again. As it is, an audio DVD is worthless to me (if you want to see a more exteme example of this trend, look at the reissues of the early King Crimson albums). Does video of the concert exist? Apparently not.     I do have the earlier Mobile Fidelty Sound CD, which I keep just because it replicates that \\"pop up\\" gatefold center-spread of the original record. But for others who care about packaging, that is one reason to buy this album. I am one who will replace favorite CDs based only on improved packaging, but it doesn't sound like the booklet included here is anything much -- although Ian is such an entertaining writer that I always enjoy his notes -- and usually get a pretty good laugh or two from them.     Overall, there are so many CDs re-releases where the original album gets lost in a sea of semi-worthless bonus tracks, usually live tracks of little value. The result is that it often dilutes the essence of the original masterwork. Too bad CDs can't be more like movie DVDs, where you watch the original movie, and then have to go back to the menu to get the bonus features. The best CD re-issues are those that add just 3 or so carefully chosen bonus tracks, like singles of the era that were not included on the original album, a b-side or two, or a quality studio out-take that was unreleased. This was done on the previous Stand Up re-issue, which added the marvelous \\"Sweet Dream\\" single and a couple other non-album tracks. The live CD on this reissue isn't even all that fitting, as it seems that most of the material is from the later Benefit album, and even one track from Aqualung.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|best one out of the 3. even the music is more pro than before. graphics is amazing and no more pig sound. oink oink no more!

B0041KKYBA|4.0|This movie presents the complicated steps and mis-steps that led to the greatest financial meltdown of modern times in a clear and entertaining manner. Democrat or Republican it will make you mad as hell. There are no innocents. There are plenty of bad guys and, sorry, they don't get what they deserve in the end.<br /><br />Capitalism at heart is pretty simple: an individual or group of individuals invest their resources in a venture. If that venture succeeds they get their startup investment back plus something over and above. If the venture fails, they lose their investment. The system is meant to spark innovation and ensure that stronger ventures take off and weaker ones fall by the wayside. When it works, jobs and wealth are created and more capital is available for other new ventures. Not a perfect system, but the best man seems to have come up with so far. Except now this nifty system has been co-opted and perverted by people like the greedy buggers exposed in INSIDE JOB. Oh, they're willing to take big risks for big returns alright, but the risk is borne by others and the returns go right into their personal coffers. They thrive even if the venture fails!<br /><br />So the Fat Cats get richer and the rest of us see our standard of living crumble.<br /><br />I do wish the movie would have also discussed how \\"the rest of us\\" actually helped the Fat Cats destroy us by burying ourselves with easy credit, sub-prime mortgages, and all manner of borrowed finery. Then, when it all collapses, we're angry that we can't find a new job that will support us. In reality, even our old jobs didn't really support us. They just covered the minimums on our credit cards! Now, the Fat Cats get million-dollar buyouts and houses in the Hamptons while \\"the rest of us\\" will have to work until we die.<br /><br />I hope this film encourages \\"the rest of us\\" to beat these creeps at their own game. Let's bite the bullet and live UNDER our means. Save. Invest wisely. Let these brokerage houses know that only those with a detailed code of ethics that they actually honor will get our money. Let our elected officials know that we're watching who they're getting into bed with and will no longer tolerate blatant conflicts of interest.<br /><br />If we're willing to demonstrate just a bit of bravery, we can make this mess the catalyst for a better way of life.h a detailed code of ethics that they actually honor will get our money.

B000FC2PKG|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Lisa Gardner and it certainly won't be my last.  What I loved most about Alone, was how real the characters are.  Bobby Dodge is the wounded hero-every man, that men can relate to, and women can fall in love with.  Catherine, the anti-heroine, I say that because as a reader, I could sympathize with her one minute and despise her the next, was a fully formed character with layers upon layers.  Of course Bobby is attracted to the woman who's married to the man he just killed as a police special forces sniper.  Talk about starting the book out with a bang, pun intended.<br /><br />Catherine was kidnapped as a twelve year-old, and kept in a hole in the ground for 28 days by a sadistic beast of a man who goes to prison for 25 years for his crime.  When he gets out, of course he's looking for Catherine, the only one of his victims that he didn't outright kill, unless you count killing someone's soul.  She's now damaged goods and accused of making her 4 year old sick for the attention she gets.  It doesn't help that she's sleeping with her son's handsome young doctor.<br /><br />Bobby Dodge is also damaged, his mother deserted the family, so when he sees Catherine and witnesses the lengths she'll go to to protect her son, Bobby is smitten enough to go against his job, his friends, anything to help this woman in her hour of need.<br /><br />Sure there's a great and suspenseful plot, but for me what makes this book really hum, is the characters that Gardner creates.  We are allowed into their heads to see who they are, warts and all, and allowed to see why they do the things they do.  When I read about evil, especially people we consider good, doing evil, I want to know why?  What starts people down the road to doing the unspeakable?  Gardner gives us a look into the why and that's what's made me order three more of her books after reading this one.<br /><br />If you want a book to keep you up late into the night turning pages until you finally reach the last one . . . Lisa Gardner is the real thing.  Perfect for the beach, plane or just to relax, she writes the kind of books that take you away for awhile, into a world with intriguing characters who you want to meet again.  Luckily, Gardner uses the same characters in her other books.  I can't wait to meet up with Bobby Dodge again.nally reach the last one . . . Lisa Gardner is the real thing.

B0039UTDA6|1.0|I am sorry but I for one love documentaries. Have for years. I have a varitable collection of series. My buddy got the life series with OPRAH narrating. It was torture. She completely ruined this particular documentary series. Do yourself a favor and buy it with David Attenborough narrating. He actually knows what he is talking about, literally knows. Unlike Oprah that has no vast knowledge of biology, life, or nature. She just reads a script. When David narrates you can understand that he truly knows and loves what he is doing, and that makes all the difference.

B001HN69AY|2.0|I'm only giving it 2 stars because the cinematography is really good.  Plus I like the world of imagination that the writers were going for.  Sometimes you'd experience really bizarre and yet, totally fascinating creatures floating around at the most unusual of moments.  The movie really does a nice job incorporating the dream-like fantasy elements.     However, if there'a any kind of coherence in the storyline I seriously couldn't find it.  In fact, if there's a storyline *itself* I couldn't find it.  I found absolutely nothing intelligible about the entire film.  It makes me wonder if the entire purpose of the movie was to just show off the latest technology in movie making.      What I gathered is that there's apparently this group of people consisting of a man and a woman, they like to dress up as part of a stage show and perform for people by dancing and acting.  They tend to perform in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, in front of nobody.  It's true!  I really have no idea what kind of audience such a pointless display of weirdness is supposed to attract (in both the movie *and* in real life, hehe) but there you have it.    Sometimes an old man and a midget would appear on screen, and neither of these two characters did anything as far as character development or providing any kind of entertainment for the viewers.  Perhaps there's an element of humor implemented that I wasn't able to grasp, but if that's the case, well, you can't really combine humor with a disjointed storyline concerning a fantasy world can you?  Because now the majority of the audience is left sitting there totally confused.      Perhaps I simply didn't get it.  No wait- scratch that.  I *really* didn't get it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|\\"Despicable Me\\" is a computer animated film from Universal Pictures / Illumination Entertainment. The delightful comedy revolved around one criminal mastermind named Gru (voice by Steve Carell), who, inspired by the recent heist of a pyramid, vows to become the world's greatest villain by stealing the moon.     To do so, however, he needs to borrow from the Bank of Evil. To convince the bank's president Mr. Perkins (Will Arnett) that the project is worth the investment, Gru has to get a \\"shrink ray\\" (you can't just carry the moon in your pocket). And to steal the gun from another supervillain wannabe Vector (Jason Segel) ... well, in short, he adopts three orphaned girls Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) for his grand heist plan.    The story of \\"Despicable Me\\" begins in a digressive manner, making room for Gru the film's \\"supervillain\\" to show what kind of a person he really is, and what he can do with his faithful assistant and inventor Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and yellow-colored likable \\"minions.\\" Eventually the story comes down to the bond between the three girls and their surrogate father, but like in a French animation \\"The Triplets of Belleville,\\" the story is there for the imagination to be explored in the Golden Globe nominated film.    The real strength of \\"Despicable Me\\" lies in its main character Gru (who looks and acts a bit like Mr. Bean), and his world full of brilliant colors and wry humor. Perhaps the film would have been much better with more distinctive personalities given to the little girls. Still, the film is a very enjoyable ride with a nice blend of humor, sentiment and action.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Yes like many of you i loved and reread the 1st and 2nd books numerouse times. Yes we haters might want a happy ending, but I think we deserve it after all the death in the book.

Sorry, but this is what I think and everyone has thier own opinion.

0590447254|5.0|This has been a long time favorite in our house. It was perfect for our children from about 2 years old to age 6.<br /><br />It has the most fun rhyming sequences and leaves the reader guessing after each page about what kind of animal will be revealed on the next page. When my son was little, his favorite one was turning the page to reveal the 'kangawoo'. I think I read it to him a lot just to hear his little voice say that one word.<br /><br />The illustrations are packed full of details and my kids loved to find the mama's and babies pictured throughout.<br /><br />A ton of fun to read, even when they know what's coming.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Agatha Christie would be proud of the five-twist ending to THE LINCOLN LAWYER. The film is clearly top-notch and street smart. It's the most efficient, solidly crafted courtroom thriller since PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. It has so many twists and turns that it's likely that the popular mystery writer would be giving it her approval.<br /><br />It also reignites the career of Matthew McConaughey as an actor, not just a charismatic star. He manages to be smoothly appealing despite playing a corrupt lawyer who has no scruples in defending guilty clients as long as they provide the cash flow he demands. It's only after defending RYAN PHILLIPPE from a charge of murder and rape that he realizes he does have a few scruples left. And the plot twists provided by the screenwriter John Romano from the novel by Michael Connelly, are deftly handled for maximum shock effect. Brad Furman keeps the direction tight and forceful.<br /><br />The cast surrounding McConaughey has been selected with care and all of them offer realistic performances. Marisa Tomei is appealing as his ex-wife who knows his shortcomings but is still attracted to him, and William H. Macy delivers a solid performance as his investigator friend. Ryan Phillippe is excellent as the client whose surface appearance belies the fact that he's as street smart as his sleazy lawyer, and FRANCES FISHER is outstanding in a small but pivotal role as the young man's protective mother.<br /><br />Not since the days of PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION has there been a more intelligent script than this one, designed to baffle and blindside the viewer in the course of unraveling some startling surprises.<br /><br />By all means, highly recommended for fans of this genre.

I grew up practically dancing to their tunes as a teenager in the Philippines.  At that time, there were so many (including my cousins) who formed bands and the music they played most of the time was by The Shadows. Hearing the music again brought back a lot of great memories.  This DVD is a must! What great entertainment!
B004SKHJF2|3.0|The fact that Shazam limits your number of searches per month encouraged me to try out Soundhound, which has unlimited searches.

While Shazam is a fine service and nice interface, it's just not as good as Soundhound, unlimited searches or not. Soundhound is faster, plain and simple. It spends less time listening to the song before going to search, and the search time was faster too. Both link to Amazon MP3 quickly which I like and both can share on Facebook or email so no advantages there. Both give you access to lyrics but on Soundhound it is built into the app so it loads quickly whereas Shazam opens an Internet browser so it takes longer to load.    So I give Shazam a 3-star \\"OK\\" because it is a very OK app. It's just not the best one out there performing this service, which is Soundhound.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|The older the vintage....the better the wine.  This is how I would describe Cliff Richard and the Shadows - The Final Reunion concert.  WOW -- these guys look and sound fantastic!  As a teen I remember how we would dance to Cliff's and The Shadows' music and the songs certainly bring back a lot of memories.    Sound quality -- terrific!  The show itself - par excellence!  What great entertainment...I didn't want the concert to end.  Wish they could do more.    If I could give more than 5 stars for this show, I would.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fun app great use of touchscreen! It slices,  it dices, it makes mellons split in half! Watch out for the bombs though! I like this, but not as much as angry birds rio.
B004SKHJF2|2.0|I played 7 songs from 2011's SXSW samplers, but Shazam couldn't identify any of them. Neat concept,  but not quite there yet. Also, no App2SD capability for a 2mb file is disappointing. Glad it was free today, so no harm done.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|This is another application ported over from old java games for old phones to now run on android!  It is written for phone screen sizes. and does not scale to 10&quot; Tablets at all and runs in top left corner only! Don't buy unless you like using one fourth of your glorious screen.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i have this for the droid. got it from tbe amazon app store and played it at the airport. i had 4 people watching and laughing!  i eve let them try it!! what a HOOT!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Amazing. I have never uttered the words &#34;couldn't put it down&#34; until now. When can I expect the next installment?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|By far the best Angry Birds. The game runs smoother and faster and keeps the original quality of the previous games. Definitely a must have for Angry Birds fans and a must try for everyone else.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|this app opens only a couple of times on your phone and then you will not be able to use it again so play as much as possible. it might just be a demo but looks kind of fancy for just a demo.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Won't recognize anything. Just keeps erroring saying it can't find it and should it try again. Uninstalling and am going to find something that works. Very unimpressed.
B0032UYFAG|5.0|Seriously, why can I not even pre-order this yet?  The new season starts in July, and I assume this will be released a few weeks before... why no release date?  Still???!!!  Someone tell me what's up.  Could it actually come out after the new season starts?  That would be ridiculous.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I bought this on vinyl even though I had the CD.  Its one of those albums that needs to be in any music lovers collection.  The 2 record set had a couple of bonus tracks that I can't believe are kept from the CD.  Marty Robbins \\"Big Iron\\" and Glen Campbells \\"Wichita Lineman\\" are just fantastic covered by Mr. Cash and alone worth the price of the vinyl.  There have been volumes of praise written about these recordings so I won't say anymore, just wanted to add my 2 pesos.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|This book as a selection for my face-to-face book club this month, and I was really intrigued when the members of the book club picked this as a selection. I suspect that is was because of the controversy that the book as stirred.    I must admit that the timing for reading this book was good for me because my husband and I had just gone to a showing of the documentary The Race to Nowhere, so my reading of this book is probably somewhat tempered by the viewing.    While I understand the controversy surrounding the book, especially the reactions to some of the harsher exchanges in the book between Chua and her daughters. Honestly, however, I expected it to be much more disturbing of a read than I anticipated, and I expected to find myself angrier with Chua's parenting approach much more than I was.    Overall, I found the book well-written, insightful, and often very poignant as Chua recalled raising her daughter's and carefully explained the differences she sees between Chinese Mothers and Western Parents. One of the more interesting aspects is her explanation of Chinese Mother as she carefully notes that a parent does not have to be either Chinese or a mother to be a Chinese Mother, but rather it's more of a philosophical stance or belief system about the role of the child and the parent and beliefs about education. This does, however, mean, that much of this philosophy is not informed by the Chinese culture for those Chinese Mothers who are indeed Chinese.    As I was reading this, I found myself reflecting on my own upbringing and my parents approach to various aspects of child-rearing, including their beliefs about the value of education. And, I reflected on my recent viewing of The Race to Nowwhere. The one thing that I keep thinking was that it's really all about balance and helping your children find a balance in life while still understanding that school should be a priority.    I must admit that I do see value in some of Chua's parenting strategies but others, including the inability for a child to pick the musical instrument that he or she would like to learn, a bit too harsh. For instance, we have a piano and a trombone, neither of which my son has been interesting in learning to play. Instead, he wanted to learn to play the guitar, so after some discussion with family and friends, we have decided to pursue this desire. I will admit that I still hope that he will want to tickle the ivory at some point, but unlike Chua, I am not going to force piano lessons on him.    What I do think is appealing about this book is that as you read you realize that Chua does really want the best for both of her girls, and she does come to learn that she cannot push each of them in the same way or in the same way that she was pushed. However, there are times that the book will make very angry as they view the way she talks to her daughters and the way she often manipulates them to get them to succeed in the way she wants them too.
1932907009|5.0|The loss of Blake Snyder was a huge loss to the screenwriting and novel writing world!  Easy to read and entertaining, Save The Cat! is definitely the way to go for beginning screenwriters and those who wish to learn to analyze novels and movies for their structure.  Each \\"beat\\" of the storyline is explained in detail with a multitude of examples from popular movies. A great tool for screenwriters and for novelists who want to take their plotting to the next level and ensure they have all the points before they get down to writing.  Highly recommended!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game a lot. and so does my wife and daughter.so many levels and cool UI. and the birds look really cute too.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Rovio still can't figure out how to code their games so they do not lag in later rounds. At first the game is a great update but by the time you reach level 2-13 the game is very unresponsive. Once in level 4 the game is almost unplayable.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Great app and got free from amazon today,.... Works really good in my few tests after downloading the app earlier today.  Love the ability to sync with facebook and twitter.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Love this product, fast shipping too which was nice!   Veronica Mars is fantastic.  THE only series I would buy on dvd.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|really fun game, but horrible graphics on HTC Evo... it looks amazing on most phones. Fix please? Could just be my version, but it looks pixelated &amp;&quot;stretched out&quot;
B0040QYROA|5.0|Amazon messed up on this product as far as reviews are concerned. They are posting reviews on this particular version of Metropolis from a different version of this film, and yes that version was awful, horrible quality.<br />However, this version is as good as silent film restoration can get. This is an amazing film to begin with and with an extensive restoration and lost footage added, this is the definitive version of Metropolis. If you are a silent film enthusiast, or if you even like silent film at all, this is a must own.<br />Like I said don't listen to the bad reviews, they aren't accurate. This version of Metropolis was released in November 2010, and there are reviews posted on this product that date back to 1999. Make sure when you are reading reviews on this product check the date of when it was posted.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Way better graphics! Love it! Runs smoothly on Captivate. Could be harder and needs more levels. All in all, a much needed upgrade to the Angry Birds series.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Tried out out because it's free today. I was very unimpressed. Shazam hardly got one song correct while soundhound was shot on each time. Not worth the space on my phone let alone the $5 it usually costs
B004SKHJF2|1.0|I have soundhound and this app. Since I got both for free, no complaints from me! It finds every song I throw it's way!  P.S....  Amazon just lost a star for making me write 25 words minimum for an app review........
0439023491|5.0|I can't believe some reviewers did not like this book. After reading the Hunger Games I was not sure I wanted to get right back in Katniss' world. So I read a couple of other books then decided to download it to my Kindle. I was hooked from the first page. Now I can't wait to download Mockingjay and find out what happens in the Capitol and who survives in the end.
0066620996|4.0|It's a good read and certainly inspiring. I would have liked a little more depth though, acknowledgement of other work on some of the topics which Jim Collins and his team cover. For example the claim that you can't develop Level 5 leadership would certainly have its critics. That does not make the idea any less valuable but it would be nice see what other authors think about this. A similar book by a less known author 'Enduring Success. What we can learn from the history of outstanding coprporations' is a good companion to 'Good to Great' in the sense that it provides not only an additional perspective but also gives a broader overview of some of the topics and debates.[[ASIN:0804772215 Enduring Success: What We Can Learn from the History of Outstanding Corporations]]
B001SGEUME|5.0|From the start Oasis was ready to make there mark in the world of music, hands down this is a most have for any music fan.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So, yeah...I LOVE Angry Birds!!!! Rio is a steroids version with better graphics and more puzzles!!! Still thankful amd impressed this is a 'free' app!!!!! Galaxy Tab.
B0019N94X6|5.0|This movie is way over the top. Extremely violent and I love it. I remember seeing this movie in the theater and how it was to see it on the big screen. With everyone having large flat screen tv's and blu ray this movie will be perfect for home. I can't wait the see this in high def. Surprised it's taken so long for the blu ray to come out but it will be worth the wait.  \\"Look at the pelican, fly pelican\\", \\"I always tell the truth, even when I lie.\\"
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with the first 2 books I could not put this one down.  I loved the changes the characters went through from the Hunger Games to War.  As you read this book you feel the pain and darkness of Katniss - which seems very real when having to see the death and disstruction all around you.  When you are finished with the book you feel some happiness for Katniss knowing she has found some light in Peeta.  But as is all wars you also walk away with some sadness as any one in war remains with even once it is over.  Bravo to Suzanne Collins for making those emotions come alive and for giving us a happy ending but with a realistic tone.
0192805606|5.0|This book is not so easy to read but many great books are like that. The style is a challenge which ultimately enhances the experience. Delve, struggle and you'll love the ride.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an excellent 2nd book in the trilogy. you won't beable to put it down and before you know it are finished and itching to read the final book.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|lets me download app but then get a &quot;package error&quot; and it wont let me install. love the original and seasons. SOS anyone else have this problem?
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Couldn't be much easier, just plug in the connector then attach to a camera and your pictures are ready to download.
0142001104|4.0|When I purchased this book I was expecting the authors to address me on a personal level, and instead they addressed 'The Art of Possibility' as an organic interaction with the world, usually in terms of leading an endeavor or large group.  They reframe life more as 'making a contribution' than a 'let's all win' philosophy.  There are twelve lessons total, each their own chapter.    If you've read in the field of creativity or even self-help, the first two chapters will rehash familiar ideas.  The usual 'think-outside-the-box' approach of horizon-expanding manuals.  Lesson Three, 'Giving Yourself an A' is about breaking down your own mental blocks in order to increase personal performance.  Rule Number Six (don't take yourself too seriously) and Lesson 11: The Art of Possibility (the vision statement) are common pieces of advice in business books on leadership.  Lesson eight, 'Giving Way to Passion', is the typical 'you'll-get-better-results-if-love-what-you-do' mantra common in business start up manuals, and Lesson Nine (Lighting a Spark) is how to stir passion as a group leader.  Lessons 4,5,10, and 12 are about group dynamics -- how to 'enroll' yourself in a group, contribute, separate yourself from the situation at hand, and creative a positive group narrative.  The authors make the assumption the group you are in is doing enjoyable and important work, but also try and make the 'group' lessons relevant in a personal sense.      Much of the content in the book was familiar, but the reason I liked it is one author is a symphonic conductor.  This gives a unique viewpoint.  Ben is familiar with the nuances of leading people, and the concepts above are illustrated brilliantly with stories from his (or his wife's) personal life.  These stories invested me in the book, I felt like I had a greater connection to the material.    I don't know how much, if at all, this book will change the possibilities in my life, but it certainly connected/inspired much better than othervolumes on the same topic I've read.  The authors had passion.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|I downloaded this app for the HTC Evo, runs smoothly. Gave it a try since it was free. Haven't tried the other app people keep mentioning (SoundHound).
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this version of Angry Birds! App installed and runs with no issue on Captivate (Amazon App Store and Angry Birds). Although people are complaining that the app store is required to run downloaded apps, I don't see the problem. Amazon is merely countering the piracy present in the Google Marketplace.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It installed on half of my devices, so that's 2.5 stars. However, it's got amazon drm, meaning no offline play, and I now have to reinstall it after an update to the amazon appstore broke the drm, losing all of my progress.  That docks it the extra half star.   Actual game doesn't suck, but most of the focus seems to have been in visuals, not the Hallmark intelligent level design of angry birds past.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I listen to European dance music, and I find soundhound horrible at recognition of the music simply because it fails to recognise the songs at all. Shazam, is nearly a guarantee to find the songs.
B001P3OMY6|3.0|How fun would it be to go to Austenland for a couple weeks?  I think it would be wonderful.  In fact, I was a little envious of the main character Jane for having the opportunity to experience this vacation.    This book is a fun one-day read.  I do think it could have been so much more interesting if the author had gone deeper into the story.  For example, what if we could have had some insight into the thoughts and feelings of the love interest(s) or others at the resort?  What if we learned the story of how this resort came to be?  Or perhaps why the woman who runs the resort seems so bitter?  Or what if we could have learned more about how Jane adjusted to life once she returned from Austenland?    The book was too short to get me emotionally connected to the story or characters, so I would classify this one as an entertaining read but a little on the shallow side.
0385341679|3.0|I was looking for spoilers for months - could not stand the who did she kill agony -  and get the book and it's one book..then another book, then another, then another.  I other words, Mac and every reader was guessing through 594 pages of who's who and what's really real.  And then well, people come together but if you want to know what they ARE???  No one's telling.<br /><br />And, okay - well, I skipped about 150 pages - and like some of you got to the end.  SLIGHT SPOILERS NEXT!<br /><br />Did read right up to the Barron's can't...spoiler...die thingy and then it was well, okay - so what happens? And yes everything but the kitchen pot got thrown into the final chapters but I found it an amazing character break that Dani would be out there alone at the end; I mean this is a person who will destroy worlds for someone she cares for? And pardon someone with dreamy eyes in a flash, cuz it's just who they are...but a child on the run and scared is left hanging while Mac's world is finally in a mellow peace?  I found that hard to believe...and time went by until the epilogue; it was also major unfinished business for Mac to let be.<br /><br />It seemed incongruous. Not so much that the book was tedious but the all the PREVIOUS books didn't flesh out a myth arc that would allow for all the throw ins at the end. Characters interacted with for 15 minutes books ago being so significant, et. al.<br /><br />And if you had all the answers - you'd just ignore them. Sure I could do it once, and never open the book - but the other - seems like a weird and dangerous place to be.  And using the info doesn't \\"taint\\" the person - the whole I can sense the book, but I never sensed it...where it alt world is...is a stretch beyond where I would hope a bestselling author would go.<br /><br />Anyway, happy Mac got a lighter shade of pale...or grey...and loved the descriptions of the black lines/wings in the White Mansion etc. Karen is a superb writer for detail and character introspection -<br /><br />and hey, with the last two words, it's obviously not over yet. But nooooo....would never have read the first one all those years ago if I'd have known it would take the amount of time it take a child to (almost) become an adolescent (8 years or so?) to get ANY happiness or peace of mind for Mac, lol!<br /><br />I do wonder if the ending changed over all the years as Karen's life experiences did as well?  Because we had an awful lot of anguish and darkness and violence for an awful lot of years before we saw any light - interesting parallel perhaps?s, it's obviously not over yet. But nooooo....would never have read the first one all those years ago if I'd have known it would take the amount of time it take a child to (almost) become an adolescent (8 years or so?) to get ANY happiness or peace of mind for Mac, lol!

B002ZG980U|5.0|Plenty of ppl told me how great this movie was, and on my plane ride home from Central America they had it on. I haven't found myself so into a movie in a while, until Inception! When the showing on the plane was done I just knew I had to own it, and the first place to look was Amazon. Great price and fast shipping.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Doesn't install in htc evo. Making me mad because I was really looking forward to playing it.. Please fix soon. Does anyone know a solution?
1593272774|2.0|I ordered this book in hopes that it would be useful in some manner to my 9 yr. old, MindStorm loving son. It is not. While the pieces in this book are, indeed, machines, they are built with a specific set of LEGOS which must be special ordered. It doesn't have anything to do with the typical MindStorm or LEGO collections. This would be an interesting book to use in elementary science classes (if you own the kits), but really doesn't seem to stand on its own. I would only recommend this book to people looking to go to the next creative level with LEGOS (such a creating machines on a model scale). Good photos and illustrations with assembly steps, but no parts lists or measurements -- hence the 2 of 5 star rating.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|this app wont load past the first screen. crashes right away. promps for re-download from amazon app store. very frustrating because its only free  for today...
0452287022|5.0|Amazon really did a great job helping me recieve this book for school. I needed this book for English class and it was here in the matter of a few days! This book is amazing. There's a lot of twists and turns to make you never want to put the book down! I've had this book for a few weeks now, and I am almost done with it! I strongly recommend this book for a class read, or just a quick read. Griet (the main character) will take you to a whole new world...!  thank you!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|wonderful app. finds music in seconds and auto links to purchase sites. keeps tabs of all music I look up so I van go back and review it later. simple to use, which is the most important feature.
0307165485|5.0|I bought 2 copies of this book. One for my son and one for my father to keep for reading to his grandchildren, because he used to read it to us when we were little, and his copy was so worn that some of our favorite stories were missing pages. I loved this book as a child, and still love seeing how much my son enjoys the stories and how easy it is for him to flip through the pages and start to read.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Another great game from Rovio, but restricting it to the amazon app store is pretty lame. still,  a nice addition to the angry birds franchise.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Tried for the first time by singing a tune but no luck with it locating the song. Tried with a Dire Straits sing playing on radio and it identified it. Total time about 60 seconds including sample time.
0736420959|4.0|Very minor point but the Amazon page shows the new cover for this book but when it arrived it had the old cover on it. Again, this is very unimportant in the overall scheme of things but I am just bringing it up now so other customers know the same thing might happen. Of course the old-style cover might be better.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Even better than the first two versions. Graphics have been greatly improved and the experience is great as always. cant wait for the next version of this game
1439130833|5.0|I just love the simplicity of the words and ideas of each day.  It really is stating the truth that \\"attitude is EVERYTHING\\" over and over in different ways, to penetrate even the most stubborn minds, if the person is only willing to hear and learn.  Having a short daily reminder is so very helpful as a daily compass for each day in keeping my thoughts aimed in the right direction.  If you like daily calender quotes...this is much more uplifting and worthwhile.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|App keeps getting a error saying to reinstall. and after reinstall still get error. one star until fixed. OG Droid. please fix soon love this app
B004SKHJF2|1.0|this app Is/was just utter crap when i first used it. I went to soundhound and never looked back. beware of who your app comes from. developer is/was major spyware firm, if memory serves me.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the graphics on this version, hope the previous ones are updated to match. This has me excited for the movie lol. From the moment I downloaded I became addicted all over again
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Stupid problem couldn't ever tell David Bowie from Howard Jones. Lame. Uninstalled. Not worth five bucks. HTC Eris. If it can't tell you simple 80's titles then its worthless.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Anyone could easily see the improvement in graphics and physics. this could easily be named Angry Birds 2. worth the $.99 without a doubt ...

B004GJDQT8|3.0|It does a decent job with just searching, so props for that..I guess. It's ok for price comparing, but there are apps that do just that better. Lacks a lot of the convenience amazon is known for. Can't really just browse, which for an app, thats exactly what i'd actually want to do. As other guy mentioned, the permissions this app asks for, a little strange. With that and the overall experience this app feels more like bloatware, something that verizon would stick on a phone, than a clean app that makes my life easier. Lot of potential in a good amazon app, so I hope they put more time into this.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 5 / 5<br />video- 5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br />best ben affleck movie since gone baby gone.<br />action scenes were frequent and very well done.<br />loved it all - great video and audio quality throughout.<br />watched it several times already and still not tired of it.<br />a 'must have addition' to your blu ray collection.
B004QMW1NM|4.0|Coming from an older, NON-hipster point of view, I still have to say that this album is very good.  The songs are really catchy, but it is certainly not entirely trite pop.  Their 80s synthpop and Brit-rock influences shine through and have been shifted into something that is their own unique soothing sound.  There is a shoe-gazing, yet still engaging Brian Eno-type of vibe on half the tracks.  There is also emotion and depth to both the sound and the themes and the production is art-house'esque and mature sounding in a unique way.  Two of the songs have a ton of focused energy behind them.    If any of that abstract description strikes your fancy, you will want to definitely get this release.  I don't know... it definitely has appeal to me.  It's not perfect, but worthy of at least 4 crispy stars.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 5 / 5<br />video- 5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br />need i say more...<br />really impressed with both video and audio quality, best i've seen it look<br />' at home ' since veiwing it at the cinema all those many years ago.<br />blu , unfortunately showed up all of the stunt doubles too clearly for my part,<br />however this still is highly recommended.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|I follow Tim Ferriss on Twitter and read his blog, so I'm a fan.  I work in health care, and I know Americans need to really examine their diet, and I agree with Tim that modifying your diet is a great step. If more of us would follow his slow carb lifestyle, we'd be a healthier nation.<br /><br />Some of the other things he shares in the book, I'm not in such agreement with.  All of the supplements he recommends won't work for everyone (and for some people, which he does say in the book, can be dangerous).  I don't think you need all of that extra supplementation.  His diet alone should give you great results (which he also says, the supplements are just to give you an edge).<br /><br />We also call can't afford the tests he puts himself through to make sure everything is working and tailored to our needs.  However, he does give you that warning, and says you can pick and choose what you want to from his book.  That's why the four stars.  I think the book has a lot of valuable things to say, but also some fluff.<br /><br />As I said, I am a fan of Ferriss.  I think he engages in some hyperbole from time to time.  I have a feeling if I researched every anecdote (I only researched a few, but comments on his blog lead to questions about others), I'd find they were all true, but maybe something was left out.  That's fine.  That's marketing.  Just don't take everything here at face value.<br /><br />One good thing is that you can find almost all of this information on his blog, and he's very open with the comments as far as I can tell. He doesn't delete critical ones, and responds to questions.<br /><br />As he says, do your own research.  Find out what parts you want to use and believe.  I think trying to modify your diet and exercise routine at all is worth trying, and if anyone can make you believe you can do it, it's Tim Ferriss.  I think he could \\"sell ice cubes to Eskimos.\\"  Reading this book makes you FEEL like you can become superhuman, and motivation is part of the solution.the solution.
B004OZZ624|4.0|This is a well done story that has our hero realistically come up with several ideas to free his wife from jail or make money to finance their escape that don't work, but is so determined that he keeps at it until he hits on ideas that do.  This makes his successes more sweet, and you can feel how close he is to missing his chance, messing up or running out of time, or getting caught by the police who get several lucky breaks and are close on his tail.  The process he goes through is interesting and builds the story, but is very much not for the younger among us who demand hot action every three minutes or else!  Liam N. and Brian D. are both excellent in small roles.  This movie is powerful if you can put yourself in the situation, and I found it smart and inspiring.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|This book presents a lot of interesting concepts about memory, and I loved all the anecdotes.  It definitely made me look at memory and remembering in a new way. I also liked Foer's study on the evolution of rote memory.  I can't remember my own phone number, and I've got advanced degrees.  It used to be you wouldn't get accepted to advanced learning without remembering entire books.<br /><br />While I did enjoy the book, it wasn't what I expected.  I don't think Foer gives us enough tools to do what he did: become a master mnemonist.  I've heard of the mnemonists techniques before (the concept of a memory palace was new), and I was hoping his book would help me manage them.  I've read enough about these techniques to know that I find the systems unwieldy. It takes longer to work with the systems, in my mind, than it does to remember things the old fashioned, rote, way.<br /><br />This book didn't really give me anything new on that front.  I still find them unwieldy.  The only good news on that front:  Moonwalking with Einstein lead me to purchase Ed Cooke's book, [[ASIN:0670917850 Remember, Remember : Learn the stuff you Thought You Never Could]], which seems to be more of a \\"how to.\\"  I haven't finished it, but it seems to be more what I expected.<br /><br />If you were totally uninitiated to mnemonists techniques, this book is a good overview.  Ed Cooke doesn't give much background, and I think the background is helpful.<br /><br />Plus, you're really pulling for Josh as he slides into supernerdom. It's a really fun read, but you'll still be looking for your keys after you read it.
B00001X590|5.0|I just wanted to listen to the song \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" after seening \\"Sleepless in Seatle\\". I was not familiar with this singer before, but his voice and all the rest of the songs is so captivating, I listen every time I have a chance. Thank you Amazon for having this CD, this was the only place I found it.
B004L49K20|4.0|Let's get this out of the way right up front: I have been a Duran Duran fan since the U.S. release of the \\"Rio\\" album. I also do NOT hate \\"Astronaut\\" and \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\", as many hardcore fans do. They aren't without their flaws, but for the most part are very enjoyable albums.    Nothing could really prepare me for \\"All You Need Is Now\\", or as I like to call it \\"Rio part 2: Electric Boogaloo\\". Mark Ronson has done a great job of recreating the early 80s sound with a modern twist. The album isn't perfect, but it's awfully close.    I want to single out \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\". The first time I heard it, I was speechless. The second time, I had to hear it again so hit \\"repeat\\" on my MP3 player. The third time...I cried. This is, quite simply, one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I have ever heard. And I can't stop listening to it. Ironic, considering the song's meaning...    Highly recommended.

0312370849|4.0|An enjoyable read if sad and depressing at times as well. It tells the little known story about WWII atrocities in France and Europe in parallel fashion with a current one told from the perspective of a woman living in France, married to a Frenchman. Ultimately, the conclusion is satisfying on all fronts and leaves the reader with a better grasp of history as well as insights about the French, France and human relationships.
0553062182|5.0|What a wonderful book!! Thank you Amazon for suggesting this book.  All my life I have wondered why I think and react differently from other people. I have been tired all my life and wondered why...life has overwhelmed me.  I got on the web and searched for a label that would fit me and this book tells me who I am..It's GREAT!  Now I can except myself for who I am.  I am normal for the 20% of the population because I am highly sensitive.  Please get this book for young people, so they won't wonder all their life why they act the way they do.  Thank you Elaine Aron!!
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I grew up a dog person. My wife was a cat person.  I remembered 101 Dalmatians from when I was a kid, but I had missed the Aristocats--I shouldn't have.  It was great seeing this excellent Disney classic.  The story is engaging and enjoyable without stooping to ripping out your heart by killing off a character you've become attached to.  Without being a spoiler, they all live, they all live happily ever after, and the bad guy gets the appropriate punishment in the end.  Great for kids of all ages.
B0040UAYI4|1.0|My Eagle Eye had all the issues that others complained about on their forums.  They fixed some, but not all the important ones.  Use at your own risk is what they should have stated in the description for this converter.  I read the positive reviews and they all seem like a copy & paste from the same people at the eagle eye company.<br /><br />I tried my dell, kingston, ms, and gateway keyboards and none of them worked.  Used a cheap keyboard from walmart and it worked.  For my mouse I had to use a $8 old school ball mouse just to get it to work correctly.  Even after all the time spent setting this up, I had to spend more money to get another converter to play it after the sony firmware update.<br /><br />Too much hassle so I sold it on ebay.  Waste of money and does not perform as advertised or what the paid eagle eye reviewers posted.  *sad panda face*

0307463745|5.0|Was a great compliment to downtime and my companies conference.  It is a very well structured book and written as most should be, simple and to the point.  Gained many simple insights, that were so simple I thought 'why didn't I think of that?'.  I think the structure of the book is ground breaking.  I enjoyed the fact that it defies all standard book structures and gets down to the crux of it.  No waffle just information, definitely worth a read.

B001CZVVWI|4.0|Barber of Seville is probably one of the most 'produced' opera on the Video for over 3 decades now. To compare these productions would be quite a folly, as one can see experimentation from time to time, trying to make the Opera 'feel' a little different all the time. That way, this one is no exception, except that the directors have gone overboard to make it as clumsy as possible.<br /><br />The fact that it is staged in Madrid, does not mean that one has to incorporate a lot of Spanish peasantry dancing the Spanish thingies all over the place. At times I feel that there is a lot of 'loitering' around. I was, however, impressed with the sets as such and people moving it physically right from the time of the overture throughout the staging. This is probably the only redeeming factor of the newer 'innovations'. Otherwise, the 'extras' in this production are simply distracting, irrelevant and hamming it out most of the time.<br /><br />Singing is just Divine. I would compare Florez with Florez himself. In the recent production of this opera in the Royal Opera House with DiDonato (in a wheel chair), Florez was not half this good. There, he took some time to warm up, his introductory Aria and the first two or three pieces were clearly shaky. Not in this production. He is fantastic throughout.<br /><br />Maria Bayo, the pocket sized Rosina is better heard than seen. Oh, she has quite a charming smile all by itself, and I am sure she looks quite cute in real life when not singing. But this soprano, who has probably the BEST delivery of words and clear diction and a voice and intonation to match is no sight for sore eyes while singing. She contorts her face out of proportion (I have seen that happen in L'Elisir which she sung with Villazon last year) and makes a spectacle of herself. Of course, she is not really alone in this, but in a production that is being filmed in HD and sold in blu ray, I am afraid, it stands out quite a bit. I think the cameramen were aware of this too, and thankfully there are not too many close-ups of Bayo.<br /><br />Spagnoli singing the Barber is making quite an impression as a 'Great' Barber, both here and in the ROH production. He is even better here than in the ROH again, because of the rather different tempi adopted by the conductor, Gelmetti.<br />It is always a pleasure to hear the other old warhorse, Raimondi as Don Basilio. Pratico as Bartolo has done as splendid a job here as he has as Dr.Dulcamara in the L'Elisir. He is the only one whose role fits the slapstick type designed in this production.<br /><br />All in all, a good recording, sometimes muddy during the more animated portions involving more than 3 singers together.<br />One star less for the staging and dramatization, where the visual element which is so important while experiencing opera in any form makes it less satisfying to watch and have the satisfaction of having 'experienced' it in the end. I am only relieved that these guys did not try and transplant it into the 21st century as some would have been tempted to do.re are not too many close-ups of Bayo.

0374290024|5.0|This book can only be described as a supreme whopper:  to answer the question of why the west has outpaced the east over the last 200 years, the author digs deeper than any single-volume history I have ever read, from the emergence of homo sapiens 100,000 years ago to present.  The whole way, however, he examines key concepts to tie it all together - it is not a descriptive tour, but an attempt to elicit laws from that history, by far the best grand synthesis I ever read.  For 6 weeks, I was utterly absorbed at the sweep of ideas and the panorama of human folly and endeavor.  Even better, it is simply fun to read and not a single page is dry.<br /><br />At its most basic, Morris says there are 3 possible explanations for the west's ascendance.  First, there could be a genetic difference of some sort, setting out superiority as an inevitable innate quality of the white man.  This, he says, is disproved by the fact that the from 700 CE over the next 1,000 years, eastern civilizations proved superior.  Second, if it isn't genetic, then it could be sociological, i.e. the organization that various societies choose as a way of managing themselves.  This is the bailiwick of such ideas as \\"democratic capitalism\\" as being something that sprung up in the west, with roots in the ideas of the Greeks as rediscovered during the Renaissance and transmitted during the Enlightenment, leading inexorably to the development of the \\"free market\\", private property ownership, the rule of law, and investment of surplus in productive enterprises.  Once again, he refutes this by comparing - from classical antiquity to the present -  the various civilizations that repeatedly came close to developing capitalism.  After an exhaustive review, he concludes that when there are masses of men, people act more or less the same, seeking power, wealth, and security.  Among many things, this means that individuals, even great leaders or conquerors, matter only to the extent that they accelerate or impede trends that are already in the making.  There is nothing accidental about historical progress, no contingencies that could have turned out radically differently.  THerefore, some third factor must explain things better:  geography (!).  I must admit that when he states this - in the first chapter - I was skeptical that he could pull off a convincing (and interesting) explanation over the next 600 pages.  Happily, I was completely wrong, even though I disagree with his principal conclusion.<br /><br />To make his comparisons possible, he sets out a number of factors as a kind of index to social development.  They are: 1) energy capture (muscle, plant, finally chemical/nuclear); 2) urbanism (a proxy for social organization); 3) the capacity to process and communicate information (oral/memory, writing, mass-produced books, electronic media); and 4) the ability to make war.  From these measures, we can see three great periods in human history after the last ice age (14,000 BCE).  There was the hunter-gatherer phase, then the neolithic age (with farming, domesticated animals, writing, cities, etc.), and lastly the industrial age, when the use of energy and development of technology took off vertiginously.  Until the industrial age, he argues, we were dependent of muscle power and then farming economies, which kept the overwhelming majority of humans at near-subsistence levels with few exceptions that were reached by unified trade routes (first the mediterranean with the late Bronze age and Roman empire and later the canal routes of China).<br /><br />Before the industrial age, according to Morris, societies essentially played with elements of modern capitalism:  large trade markets with economies of scale and comparative advantage, the mobilization of man power through social organization, and various new technologies, such as harnesses that no longer choke horses or iron plows and fertilizer.  Throughout history, with inevitable setbacks, technological knowledge accumulated until the birth of science.  However, they kept hitting against the limit of agricultural and animal capacity:  they could only breed and feed so many work animals on so much cleared land, which is about a maximum of 43 on Morris's social development scale.  To be sure, there was colonization of new land, the improvement of agricultural yields through innovation, but they could rarely develop beyond the 43 mark that was hit in the Roman EMpire and in 11C China.<br /><br />Something new happened, Morris argues, with the discovery of the Americas, creating a trade triangle between manufactured goods from Europe, food and cotton from the Americas, and Slaves from Africa, each paying dividends to shippers.  At the same time, as the gun enabled China to rid itself of the raids from steppe nomads, creating a huge zone of trade and relative peace, it lacked the fecundity (or diversity of goods and resources) and easy proximity that the Atlantic corridor of trade offered the Europeans.  This is the geographical factor.  Once steam power was harnessed, this economic engine was accelerated, employing the insights from Enlightenment scientists.  This is the acceleration factor, in a coming together of trends under development that culminated in the industrial revolution, first in the West.  Once other sources of energy were tapped, the acceleration increased exponentially, creating a momentum that lasted 200 years.<br /><br />There are two more principles that Morris posits.  On the one hand, innovation creates its own problems, sowing the seeds of its own destruction.  That means not just over-population, but pollution, health degradation, and any number of other consequences.  The relative peace and prosperity of Rome, for example, attracted Germanic tribes, who wished to plunder (or receive bribes for refraining from doing so) that eventually undermined the empire.  He calls this the development paradox.  On the other hand, peripheries tend to copy and improve upon innovations, leading in many cases to superior adaptations when combined with different advantages in social organization and costs.  This happened in Mesopotamia with its irrigation techniques to improve farming yields in poorer soil and today with Japanese and then Chinese industrial methods that move them up the value chain after attracting capital to exploit the cheap labor of disciplined workers.  Moreover, with the development of transportation technologies as well as authoritarian decision-making to mobilize resources and infrastructure, the advantage may be shifting to the east - decisively.<br /><br />Where I disagree with Morris is his insistence on a rigidly deterministic model.  I think that accident, circumstance, and luck matter in history:  if Diocletian had succeeded in reorganizing the Roman Empire, it may have survived and developed a new trade system.  There are many examples where history could have turned out very very differently.  I view history as much more contingent than he does.  As an illustration of the way that Morris reasons, he repeatedly states throughout the book that \\"men get the ideas that they need\\", which smacks a bit too much of the wisdom of hindsight.  Moreover, geography is certainly a factor, but not the principal one in my view.  That being said, his insistence that race and sociology matter less than is often assumed is  a point well taken, in my opinion.<br /><br />This book is a masterpiece that will get the history-obsessed to think, to refine and clarify their point of view about many trends and incidents, and to question their most basic assumptions of how things work.  It is a first rate thought experiment and well worth the ride.  Morris' long view is particularly valuable.  He is an archaeologist by training, but he has accomplished an immense intellectual labor to connect the dots between past and present - there was not a single reference that I thought was wrong or misinterpreted, though I was not convinced by his central idea.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.nnovations, leading in many cases to superior adaptations when combined with different advantages in social organization and costs.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|The entire series of angry birds games is great and give you a way to waste a ton of time. Free version is ad supported and I could see it being slow on older phones. No issues on the G2.
B004GYY714|5.0|Amazon Appstore is the best!! Just downloaded TuneIn Radio in about 4-5 seconds and now I am listening to my local radio stations. Super easy to use!!

159420229X|4.0|What do the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos, the psychologists Hermann Ebbinghaus and George Miller, and Dom DeLuise hula-hooping have in common?  They are all various chapters in the centuries long journey and research into the realm of mnemonics.  Dictionary.com defines mnemonic as \\"something intended to assist the memory, as a verse or formula.\\"  Joshua Foer, a freelance journalist, defines it as a path to a vital truth: \\"In every way that matters, we are the sum of our memories.\\"    In the fine tradition of other Gonzo Journalists, Foer doesn't just tell the story of the history of memory through to the current world wide memory championships, he lives it.  His voyage begins in a Manhattan auditorium where he observed the 2005 US Memory Championship where he met Ed Cooke, a memory savant from Britain and regular participant in the ars memorativa (art of memory).  Instead of just writing an article for a magazine about memory, Foer allows Cooke to take him under his wing and train him for the 2006 US Memory Championship.  With the help of mnemonics experts throughout the ages, Foer not only discovers the rich cultural history involved in remembering, he arrives in the Con Edison headquarters one year later to give memory experts such as Maurice Stoll a run for their money.    Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything is a fascinating study about remembering.  Man has been attempting to increase his ability to remember since ancient Greece and despite the advances in \\"external memory\\" (paper, books, the internet), the human race still finds it needs the ability to fill their minds, and lives, with memories.  Joshua Foer does a fantastic job in proving that with largely forgotten methods, we can all improve our memories.

He is a writer who carefully hones his words and loves his characters, warts and anything else ugly, and all. He brings Boston to light as it really is and his characters fit in so well-- they ARE the people of the south side of the city.  The film was as good as the book, which is hard to do most of the time. Lahane had to have a hand in the film, I'm sure.  This is a novel to purchase because it is an example of a perfect novel. He does it all.  (This novel is right up there with Stuart O'Nan's Prayer for the Dying. If you have not read that one, please do so.) Excellently done, Dennis!

I agree but the first two are really better though then any other version remastered or released previously on disc. I love this album and in some ways it is better then \\"A night At The Opera\\". My favorite on it is 'Long Away\\" but who can say they don't love \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\"? anyway, like the others they have some nice bonus tracks & I'd buy it, if the average fan, I'd stick with the previous versions released. Nice to hear the backing track of \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\".<br />Drop by mt site sometime and say \\"Hi\\" @ Judemac Forever\\"

0316017922|4.0|There are two popular themes in our lives at the moment: one is the focus on individualism and being able to realise any dream oneself and the other is that there is a scarcity of 'talent' - particularly in the workplace.  I find this book a refreshing counterpoint to both those ideas.  Not that there's anything wrong with taking responsibility to realise one's potential but the problem with misdiagnosing a circumstance and zoning in on one factor when in reality the circumstance is a lot more complicated, is that it leads to a single minded focus on the wrong solutions.  Malcolm Gladwell reminds us in a very entertaining way that success is not only the product of innate talent, practice and hard work but also of opportunities that arise from the enabling context of being in the right place and at the right time.  There is a subtle suggestion in the idea that \\"I did this all by myself\\" that those who are not at the top of their game have only themselves to blame.  Gladwell shifts the balance away from the individual to what needs to happen in communities and societies to enable talent to blossom.  It's thought provoking and has remarkable lessons that can be applied in families and in workplaces to create more `right places and right times' and thus multiply the availability of talent.    \\"To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success - the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history - with a society that provides opportunities for all.\\"
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on samsung galaxy s I find it entertaining and my kids love it. No complaints, never played the original so I have nothing to compare it with.  Thanks Amazon for making it free.

055380684X|5.0|If you really are great at something, I think this book will confirm many of your observations or assumptions about how you got there and give you insight on how to repeat it in other domains or with your kids etc.<br /><br />If you don't feel you're great at something, then it shows you the way: constantly challenge yourself, slow down, break it in segments and start over. You guessed it, it's hard :) unless you love doing it!<br /><br />So, if you like something (like motocross or skiing or whatever) and you want to get better faster, read this book... there may be others but this is a good start.<br /><br />He may be lacking in that it doesn't address simple questions like \\"IQ must make it easier or make up for some practice or coaching\\" or \\"genetically, some people may generate myelin faster than others\\" but I believe the answers to these would augment the ideas and would not be really meaningfully contradicting anything said in the book.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B000002L42|4.0|...with various reviews stating -<br /><br />Great material/renditions.  Well worth having, especially since nearly-new copies available for a couple of bucks.<br /><br />And absolutely concur on docking a star due to shoulda been a double CD.  Particularly with emphasis on Aja material (not that this is bad thing, but there are so many tracks - hits and deeper cuts - that could have been on here, and with several tracks of a pretty short list being from Aja, well there you go).

B004MMEIK0|2.0|Maybe it's a personal pet peeve, but when authors have their lead characters jump to wild conclusions, fail to discuss said conclusions with anyone, and then act on said conclusions (which are unfailingly incorrect), in order to create or fill out the plot, it feels like a cop-out.  Too many romance authors feel the need to fill up pages by making the female lead uber-judgmental and apparently incapable of perception checking (i.e. having a conversation) -- something I find personally offensive.  This book fell neatly into that group.<br /><br />Some of the world concepts (An underground vampire television network, complete with paps!) were really interesting but under-developed. A better book would have either given the characters *real* personal issues to work through in order to create romantic tension, or spent less time on the romance and more time exploring the more creative elements of Sparks's paranormal landscape.  Rather, the story was stuffed with scenes of characters acting on assumptions at every turn (and thus having to backtrack when said facts were eventually uncovered -- waste of time!), and the leads' gratuitous self-flagellation, which combined to make the heroine an idiot, the hero annoying, and the book about 200 pages longer than it needed to be.  However interesting some of the ideas were, this book definitely failed to deliver.<br /><br />But hey, it gets a star for being free!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds has occupied more of my idle time than I would care to admit. There's something so incredibly satisfying about laying down swaths of destruction with a simple finger-flick.<br /><br />I was skeptical about Angry Birds Rio both because of the movie tie-in and, well, because how can you possibly improve on such a simple winning formula without just offering more of the same?<br /><br />I was surprised on both counts. First of all, knowing almost nothing about the movie around which this game was based, nothing was really shoved in my face in an obnoxious way, and I was able to complete the first two stages without gleaning anything more about the movie than that there were blue birds involved and perhaps monkeys.<br /><br />As for the latter, the incremental changes were a hoot. There are now trees and chains and the like which serve as obstructions and further sources of destruction, as well as surfaces that bounce any item that falls on them. The monkeys you have to knock out in the second stage are also a bit of a departure, since they can cling to the bottom of horizontal surfaces and move a bit in self-preservation.<br /><br />Those were just the first two stages, and if Rovio's past efforts are any indication, they'll likely get even zanier by the time all the stages are fully released. For the price, you won't get a better time killer!

B00475AROS|4.0|This review assumes that you're familiar with the first book in Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller's Chronicle, The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fearis a book that had me laughing, crying, and groaning all at once. Laughing at some of the new adventures that young Kvothe becoems tangled in, crying because of the simple way that Rothfuss manages to make music and poetry come alive, and groaning because if I have one issue with the book, it is this: which Kvothe am I to believe.<br /><br />I accept that this is a key part of the story, the Kote that is telling the story is much different from Kvothe the Bloodless, who is different from Kvothe the Arcane, from Kvothe who attends the University. He is all of these and none of these at the same time. It's a great way to provide the reader with an abundance of different stories and smaller asides but it also made for a disjointed read. I found the second half of the novel (which is in many ways better than the first) to be a different story all together.<br /><br />One of the strongest (and my favourite) aspects of Rothfuss's writing is the way he uses mythology and music in his work. There is a subtle poet that hides behind the gritty fantasy writer that is telling this story. There have been sections in this series where I have been moved damn close to tears simply because the way that certain characters connect with music and the lyric form. The Name of the Wind is noteworthy for this very reason.<br /><br />Despite this some what frustrating aspect of the novel, I would still rank this series as one of the best that currently graces the shelves at your local bookstore.<br /><br />If you're looking for a gritty fantasy, something with a bit of a bite, then this is worth picking up. This sounds silly but this fantasy work is good in that it grounds much of its magical system in the real world. What I mean by this is that there is a set of rules that determines how magic (the arcane) functions in this universe. I enjoy it when fantasy makes use of magic in this way. It is not something born of blood or limitless. It has a finite power source and it is usually bound by the physical body and the mind. Using magic has a price and the price is never cheap or insignificant.<br /><br />Other authors who make use of magic in this same way: Joe Abercrombie and Scott Lynch.agic in this way.

0061537934|5.0|There are not enough words to say how much I loved this book.  I am a dog lover and a race lover so I will admit that it had me on both fronts but the words Garth Stein has eloquently ascribed to Enzo are so astute and true to life it felt like a true realist was talking and not a dog.    I have read over 60 books in this last year alone and this is one of my favorite books of all times.  I downloaded the book to my Kindle, which I have read twice, and have purchased a hard copy for my library.  I feel I should start to get a percentage of sales as I have recommended this book to everyone I know and most of them have purchased it.
0525951652|2.0|The best part of \\"Fall of Giants\\" was Follett's depiction of how World War I got started. He did a superb job of taking an extraordinarily complicated event and presenting it so that the reader could actually follow and understand the tortured path to war in 1914.     Otherwise, this is an extremely tiresome Noble Socialist vs. Evil Capitalist diatribe. It's a thousand pages of my life I can't get back. Kind of like all the money my socialist government has taken from me over the years.

Also, Runaway, runaway is good. But other than that , this is not as good as astronaut. Maybe its andy's absence. But the 2 songs i mention are great. I wish these bands would go back to playing their instruments rather than relying on computers to make their music for them. Ugly album cover too !! What happen to those creative covers like Rio??
0545123283|5.0|This was another beautiful book, so amazing that I'm having a hard time putting my feelings into words. I loved it and can't believe how wonderfully talented Maggie Stiefvater is, just wow!<br /><br />The story starts shortly after the end of Shiver, Sam is now a human and still sleeping and pretty much living in Grace's room without her parent's knowledge. They are still fiercely in love with each other. Unfortunately lots of complications arise, mainly from Grace's parents and something else that will leave you in tears at the end. I won't say more on that, you'll just have to find out when you read it. We also get to find out a lot more about Sam's past and his childhood, about Beck, and a theories about why the wolves change.<br /><br />The book is written from the point of view of four different people Grace, Sam, Isabel and Cole the new wolf. I have to say that I didn't think I would like the addition of these other two point of views I just wanted my Sam and Grace, but I was wrong because they definitely grow on you. I loved Isabel's strong and outspoken character, and even though Cole was a bit unlikeable at the beginning we see him change throughout the book and he now has become one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />Don't expect Linger to be fast paced or full of exciting adventure, because that is not what the story is about. Having said that, it doesn't mean that it isn't a page turner which it definitely was for me. Linger is a love story so beautifully written that it made me think that I was reading a very long poem, the emotions from the characters just leap out at you and you can definitely feel them as you read it. There are some you root for and some you hate, some that will make you smile when you read their words and some that will leave you in tears. Linger is definitely amazing and will leave you aching to have Forever in your hands as soon as you're done. If you've read Shiver I recommend you get Linger as soon as it's released!

B004EPYZUI|3.0|Sucker Punch, starring Emily Browning, arrived with a lot of hype and more than a few expectations.  But when a movie starts making you wish you were watching Matrix: Reloaded, you're in trouble.<br /><br />We start out on a dark and stormy night with Browning's unnamed character in her room awaiting the inevitable bad news of her mother's death.  She tries to comfort her little sister, but Slimy Stepdad can't be more thrilled about this- until he finds out the girls are left all the money.  One too many drinks later he barges into Browning's room; she scratches his face and locks him out, so he goes after the sister.  Browning finds his gun and fires, missing but somehow taking out her little sister.  SS has her institutionalized at Lennox House for the Mentally Insane (sic) run by Dr. Gorski (Carla Guigino) and bribes the Head Intern (Oscar Isaac- King John from Robin Hood) to schedule her for a lobotomy.<br /><br />At a critical moment, Browning funnels her surroundings into an elaborate fantasy- much like Keyser Soze in Usual Suspects. Browning, now called Babydoll, re-imagines the institution as a burlesque club/bordello of sorts run by Blue (Isaac), while Gorski (Guigino) becomes the matron and dance instructor.  In this fantasy she meets the other girls- Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), her little sister Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung)- who seem to like spending all their time in fishnets and bustiers.  Babydoll then drifts into her own fantasy- sort of like Inception, a dream within a dream.  Here she meets the Wise Man (Scott Glenn) whose fortune-cookie advice sets her on the path.<br /><br />Back at the bordello, Babydoll gets the others to follow her in a lame scheme (it is a fantasy, after all) to collect five blatantly foreshadowed items to help them escape.  As each opportunity to collect these items arises, Babydoll returns to the Wise Man for a mission briefing, with the girls in tow.  Once engaged, they all strut around in even more stripper-riffic costumes, blasting the CGI scenery into hash as Babydoll guides them to their level achievements... I mean, objectives.  But their problems are far from over: one of the missions costs a girl her life even as Blue suspects trouble and confirms it from an unlikely source.<br /><br />This flick is built upon pop culture references and homages.  From Robocop to Terminator to Star Wars, Crouching Tiger, The Matrix and yes, even Kill Bill, this is pure Fanboy Fantasy from start to finish.  Snyder pushes all the buttons- hot babes, samurais, katanas, orcs, dragons, steampunk, kung-fu and other assorted bad-a$$ery are lovingly served up in slo-mo CGI closeups focusing on the Hot Blondes while the Token Asian and Sultry Brunette take up the background.  Problem is you'll be nodding to sleep waiting for the next sequence to happen.  The plot is nonsense, especially as you're practically told twenty minutes in how it's gonna end.  The only question that remains is how it all ties together, and it's pretty corny when it does.  It's not like you're expecting this to be a tour-de-force, but a little something to work with would've been nice.<br /><br />Even the soundtrack is a little grating.  While the soundtrack itself is smoking hot, the songs are inserted at the start of every fantasy sequence like markers, which at full volume got a little annoying (Hey- look what we're doing now! LOOK!  IT'S METAPHOR!!!).  Whatever orchestrations Tyler Bates used to fill in the gaps weren't even noticeable beneath all the chaos.<br /><br />Zach Snyder has described the film as \\"Alice in Wonderland with machine guns\\", including dragons, B-25 bombers and brothels.

0470638842|4.0|During my life I have lived through two paradigm shifts in the way people communicate and interact with each other. The first was the Internet. It was 1994 and I was hanging out with a computer geek friend of mine. I sat there watching him correspond with a friend of ours who was living in Japan at the time using this thing called e-mail. He had to know the Unix programming language at the time (there were no user interface programs for the Internet) and he was using a Unix mail program called Pine. When he explained the only cost was the $20 a month he paid for the connection I was floored.    I was a newspaper reporter at the time and clearly remember walking out of his apartment, looking at the sky and thinking \\"It's all going to change. The way we communicate is all going to change.\\"    About two years ago I stumbled upon a YouTube video Social Media Revolution […]. When it was done I sat back, took a deep breath and thought. \\"Oh my God. It's happening again.\\"    Per usual, the book is WAY better than the movie.    History is repeating itself. Today's Facebook page is yesterday's Web site.    I believe that the proof is in the \\"putting\\" and I have put copies of this book in no less than a half-dozen other people.    If you're looking for some kind of historical of factual review of Social Media (as if! it's barely old enough) then you're looking in the wrong place.    Socialnomics is one of those books you'll read and if you have a modicum of experience using social media for business or non-profit business, will leave you sitting back with a big \\"A ha,\\" sense of \\"now I get it.\\"    It's a casual, dare I say \\"social\\" book, on how to use social for a purpose.     If you're into any type of marketing or sales it's a must read. Because as Quallman says in the book, it's not a question \\"If\\" you're going to use Social Media in your business, it's a question of how well you're going to do it.    Socialnomics isn't going to write out the game plan, but it sure will show you the new rules.

B0010X8NF0|1.0|I like to keep up on films.  I don't like the lame corporate product junk regularly pinched off on our movie screens every weekend.  CGI video games for little boys.  Romantic-comedies that are so bland that they all look the same (there are about nine between Jennifer Aniston entries, by my count).  Raunchy comedies that aren't funny (two words: Seth Rogen).  I can't even remember the last time I thought, \\"I've got to see that.\\"<br /><br />However, Wes Anderson is killing my enthusiasm for all art-house or independent films.<br /><br />He knows that people go to movies...to be entertained, right?<br /><br />Number one: I hate these characters.  I've been on international trips and have been exposed to some truly awful people, fellow tourists without any tact or even a clue...I'll take any one of them for a week over these hang-dog idiots for an hour and a half (even the fat, old lady I had to listen to across the Med and into the Holy Land, whose constant griping reached a hilarious crescendo in St. Mark's Square in Venice).<br /><br />Number two: I still hate these characters.  By the end, I thought, \\"Who cares?\\"  This family is a mess.  Nothing is resolved.  They grin.  Finally, some emotion.  Over what?  Who cares?<br /><br />Here's how to make a Wes Anderson film: get talented actors and tell them to stare into a camera lens, devoid of expression.  Give them inscrutable dialogue that passes as funny when explained later, but it has to come across as empty line readings--HAS to be completely emotionless and deadpan.<br /><br />Take the exotic location away and you have THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, which I thought was horrible too.  I've suffered through all of his films now...and it's now genuine suffering.  Between Wes Anderson and the Broken Lizard losers, I don't know whose new film I'd be most nauseated by.  The Broken Lizard guys don't know how to entertain.  Wes Anderson acts like he knows...but he refuses to.  Which is worse?

0240815807|5.0|About Mike Senior: Mike Senior has written many articles in Sound on Sound magazine, including the famous Mix Rescue articles (go to [...] for more great articles from Mike).  I have always been very impressed with his knowledge of the audio world, so I expected a lot from this book, thankfully I was not disappointed.     If I was going to sum up the book in one word, it would be this - Brilliant!  This book is for the home studio owner who is starting out, who has some studio experience, and those like me who have over 20 years experience when not working my day job. I have read recording books before that talked about the basics and though helpful, they lacked meat. In the Mixing Secrets book, thankfully we don't have that problem. He talks about near field monitors, clears up a lot of misconceptions we hear on the recording forums, gets into building the raw balance, compression, and EQ. He does not just explain what compression and EQ is, but how to use them properly. He also discusses side chains, reverb, and stereo enhancements. He even offers you more information on his web site [...].    The next question you ask is, how is his writing style, is this a dry book that is hard to follow? The answer is no. I think with having written so many articles in Sound on Sound magazine, has helped him develop a style that keeps your attention and leaving you with wanting more. Another great feature is each chapter ends with a summary section (Cut to the chase) and even an assignment.     Is there anything I did not like in the book? No not really. It would have been nice to have color photos in the book (which cost more for the pub company), but the blue highlights help the book look better than just the black wording. The cover has some material on the paper to help it hold up after many hours of serious reading. Though the books is excellent, it will not answer all your questions about recording (what book does?). Sound on Sound web site has a search feature for specific information on things like recording acoustic guitars that you might also find helpful.    If you buy this book and Bob Katz Mastering Audio 2nd edition, you pretty much have everything covered.     Real Life Application: So far the book has helped my drum mixes sound better, and I have a deeper understanding on using reverb, EQ and compression. So many on the audio forums ask, what is better Product A or Product B? Then they go on for pages and argue which piece of gear is better. By reading this book, you will learn the big question it not what gear is better, but are you getting the best sound you can with your current equipment. (He does get into quality of gear as well) With full time jobs, many home studio owners don't have enough time or knowledge to make great recordings. They tend to just buy higher end gear that they think will make their recordings better. To some extent the higher end gear can help, like upgrading your sub $1,500 or less monitors with Focal Twins or PMC TBII's. However understanding the Mixing Secrets explained in this book will help you out even more.  A simple thing like using good acoustic panels and bass traps in your studio will make much more of an improvement than replacing your Audio Technica 4033 with a Neumann U87i microphone.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is a must have if you are a fan of angry birds. and it has more in the coming months. and it is fun that it is based on Rio this time. and your objective is to help free the other birds. sorry no pigs this time.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|i bought this item as a gift for my gf but i cant stop listening to the music. im not usually a fan of this genre but the material sounds unique. def had me researching mr. west.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awsome app. Recommend for anyone who has played the earlier games and liked it. It's got a new story and I have yet to see any pigs or eggs From what I can tell from the first 2 levels is that you rescue birds from another bird. Also seems to run smooth and fast.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|It took a while for this movie to come to dvd and I'm glad it did.  I've owned it on laser disk for many years.  The movie was good once you get past gulibility of ralph macchio.  I'm not a blues kind of person but enjoyed the soundtrack a lot and the steve vai scene at the end is great.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|The salsa music intro brought a smile to my face, but I have to admit that the more I played the game, the more disappointed I became.<br /><br />For so little money, I suppose beggars can't be choosers, but -- compared to the regular Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons -- the levels in this game so far seem to include fewer types of birds and fewer clever \\"physics puzzle\\" type levels.<br /><br />Sure, the graphics are even more fun and colorful than before, but I just feel that the creators of this game could have done so much more with this.
B000WZAE0Y|4.0|Good family movie for adults and kids(if not to young).  Some of the action secenes are a little violent and suggestive for smaller children.  It is an original take on fantasy movies right over the wall in your back yard.
B00000DHRX|4.0|This is a excellent selection from George Michaels.  The first CD are more slow songs and the second are the dance tunes he's famous for.  Great value for the price....
0956827810|3.0|When I compare the two blank books, \\"What ever man thinks about apart from sex\\" and \\"My 100 best shags\\", I think they are both great novels.I cannot find fault on any page.Not sure which one will receive the Nobel prize. I would probably give the nod to \\"My 100 best shags\\"
B004L49K20|5.0|A sad fact, but I just recently discovered how amazing of a band Duran Duran is even though my Dad used to listen to them in the 80s. SO, I youtubed them for weeks and realized they were on the verge of another comeback and so I got a sneak peek of their new songs and I was completely blown away! It's a revival of their older songs such as \\"Planet Earth\\" and \\"Hungry Like a Wolf.\\"     I seriously cannot stop listening to this CD. One thing I have to say though, in stores the CD is NOT in the New Release Section, so don't assume that the store does not hold the CD. Target and Walmart had the nerve to put it in the pop section behind some old CDs. Duran Duran is a huge band and deserves some respect since they have been in the biz for more than 30 years. My favorite on this CD is \\"All You Need is Now\\" and \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard.\\"    If you have been listening to Duran Duran since the 80s then you will DEFINATELY appreciate their 13th album. It's fun, upbeat, and nostalgic of the 80s. When listening to this CD I wish I was born during that awesome decade! Simon Le Bon sounds amazing as ever with his sexy voice and John Taylor with his awesome bass guitar rifts! This CD does not dissapoint! Buy IT!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|has worked great every time.  its nice that they are giving this app for free.  I like that it has the lyrics for the song.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|AMAZING!!!! I LOVE THIS APP. ITS GRAPHIICALLY SO MUCH BETTER. THE GAME SHOULD BRING MORE LEVELS BUT STILL GREAT. ANGRY BIRDS CONTINUES TO AMAZE ME. I LOVE THIS APP. DEF GET IT
B0048LPRD2|5.0|I just wanted to add my 2-cents and say that this movie floored me. It's an experience that will haunt your thoughts for days. From a technical and creative aspect I am awestruck, but for a movie that pushes so far outside the boundaries of conventional film making I think it could have gotten some of the tried and true basics down first, like acting. The main character mostly just had to be a good voice actor, but he wasn't. There is a little girl however who could win an Oscar for best actress in a flashback. I seriously had to worry about what the hell they did to her to get that performance out of her. .... Actually I still worry.    Not unlike psychedelics, it is certainly not for everyone. It throws you into a world of experiences you haven't seen before but the trip can be a bad one.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I paid for the privilege of being ad free, but accessing the menu I get redirected to the Rovio news page. Annoying, unacceptable, and needs to be changed.
0061726826|4.0|This is set in a semi-distant future America where love has been declared a disease, it being the obvious cause of all the world's problems. The main character, Lena, is just a few months shy of 18, at which point she'll undergo a mandatory surgical procedure to remove her capacity for love. She can hardly wait. Creeptastic!<br /><br />I think there are more metaphors in this book than in all the other books I've read combined. Luckily, they are good metaphors, the poignant and evocative kind that make you grab a pen and jot them down so you'll never be without them. How many YA sci-fi novels do that?! I'm most in awe of the way the author describes the indescribable, like falling in love. Now, I'm not talking about the racing heart and butterflies in the tummy you get with those dime-a-dozen paranormal romances (which I adore, don't get me wrong). That's about story, a cheap trick, but this - THIS is about words. And I'm not explaining this very well, so here's an example:<br /><br />\\"My heart is drumming in my chest so hard it aches, but it's the good kind of ache, like the feeling you get on the first real day of autum, when the air is crisp and the leaves are all flaring at the edges and the wind smells just vaguely of smoke - like the end and the beginning of something all at once.\\"<br /><br />How stunning is that? I guess what I'm trying to say is that this book is better written and much more thoughtful than most YA sci-fi/fantasy being published these days. It's not perfect - all those metaphors do get a bit tiresome - but all in all it's a lovely book with a great premise, great characters and a great ending. I look forward to the next.

0811806405|5.0|This is the most complete guitar construction manual that you can obtain.  I have several to compare it to.  It is interesting to compare Mr. Compiano's construction methods to those of other luthiers.  His method may be best for those contemplating the construction of only one or two guitars ( or other wooden stringed instruments ).  Regardless of what construction proc3edure you decide to follow, this book is invaluable.  In my opinion, it is a must have for anyone planning to build a guitar.  I also liked Jonathan Kinkead's book on guitar building.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I've been meaning to buy Shazam Encore for a while now. This version is ad-free and includes unlimited tagging. Don't forget that any app with ads can send certain information about you to advertisers.<br /><br />Shazam is a wonderfully useful app that you can whip out to impress friends. Amazing technology.
0553584537|4.0|I enjoy reading Lisa Gardner suspense novels.   Alone kept me interested until the end.  I would recommend this book for anyone that is into suspense novel.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first started watching this movie.  It was a bit slow at first but the characters were so appropriate and well rehearsed that if moved with fluency and grace. The workers, the union, the strike, the family living arrangements, hardships and death, it was blended very well.  The relationship between Thornton and Margaret was increasingly intense and mystical. The ending was very romantic but I think it should have parted with the two just kissing, not her looking away again........... but, all in all, I loved it!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This isn' t available in my region, but I can really figure out why.  I was able to install the app store, register for one click purchase, and add a credit card before I was denied download.
1845761502|5.0|It is a great read covering not only the history of Winston Effects, but the people involved. It has given me a deeper appreciation for movies such as the Terminator franchise as well as the Alien franchise. These are truly artist extraordinaire! Couldn't put the book down!
B0021L8V0M|1.0|They just want to make her look so amazing. She is not amazing at all. All the BS in this movie is just BS. I am sick of every time I look anywhere, they try to make her a god.
0670022411|5.0|I just finished reading this book (on my Kindle) and loved it!!!!  I didn't want it to end and there has to be another to follow it, right?  It contained witches, vampires and demons (daemons) but it had the historical aspect so it is more than fluff.  Cross my fingers for this story to continue!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|The same concept ass Google search but for music. really like how responsive the app is. every thing works and quick and fast to search the music name.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I see everyone wrote a long review. I don't have the time, so this is what I'm going to say:  Incredible.  Amazing acting  Amazing directing  Amazing cinematography  everything.  Not to mention, the story. It was so moving and so inspiring.   Just an all around excellent movie.  MUST SEE
B004SKHJF2|3.0|It works and is pretty accurate, but its not very quick. On average it'll take up to 30 seconds (on Wifi and in a quiet room with only music)to find the info for the song. In semi noisy environments it struggles even more. Soundhound, I've found, is by far much faster (around 3-4 seconds to recognize and fetch song info) and can handle restaurant level background noise.
141690977X|5.0|Excellent and insightful - a must read.  However, I'm not sure how it applies when you are back on the dating scene in your 50's.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm not the kind of guy who's usually bothered by ads. If they make it possible for your product to be free, I'll put up with them. But in the case of Angry Birds, they tend to get in the way and slow things down, particularly on older phones like my HTC Hero. So an ad-free version for just 99 cents was one of the easiest app-buying decisions I've ever made. And then to see that my progress from the free version was retained made giving this a five-star rating another very easy call.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This is my favorite music identification app! I cant believe it went on a free day!  This app can do so much! It is astonishing that it can get the lyrics, youtube, and buy the song
B004SKHJF2|2.0|After downloading and installing, when you try and run the app, it closes and asks you to download the app again from the Amazon store. Uninstalling and downloading again does not work either. I am sure it is a decent app, but it refuses to load up on my phone.  HTC myTouch 3G with CyanogenMod 6.1.1
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I wasnt expecting much out of this new Angry Birds app, but the new gameplay mechanics, mixed with new scenes, all on top of a free price, makes this my favorite angry birds game yet.
B003CYKCHW|1.0|First what I liked. Scroll wheel has a nice action. Feels smooth with distinct ticks as you roll it. Overall the mouse fits nicely in my hand. I like the thumb shelf. I guess DPI settings might be nice for some, but I found I didn't use them. Same for the 'modes' button.    Now that's out of the way, what I didn't like. Can't reprogram DPI settings button or mode select button, so this is truly a 3-extra button mouse (middle click, and two thumb buttons). Thumb button didn't always register a click. Probably about 1/5 clicks. If i did it at just the right angle and with a decent amount force I could get it to register every time. Since I bought this mouse for gaming this is really annoying and plain unacceptable, hence the 1 star review. Do NOT buy this mouse for gaming. A quick google search turned up a few more reviews with users complaining about the cheap quality and that overall their buttons (particularly button 5, which is the one that broke for me) stopped working shortly after they got the mouse.    I wish I could return this, but I threw away the packaging after I felt it in my hand. Who would suspect that their button just would not work?
B000EMGAOY|1.0|I wish I could really rate this product the right way, but I have not recieved it yet.  I am currently deployed to Iraq, so perhaps the address has caused some confusion.  Some RHCP would really mellow me out here, so I keep waiting anxiously for this CD.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|Simply stunning.  I saw Mr. Porter live recently, not having known anything about him in advance, and was transfixed.  He has an extraordinary combination of a beautiful and carfully intonated voice, an engaging personality, and an ear for compelling and gorgeous melodies.  Often jazz singers will have certain pieces of this combination, but not everything together.  I cannot recommend the CD highly enough.  P.S. See him live to hear a much different -- and amazing -- version of the title track.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|\\"Love & Other Drugs\\" is definitely one of the strangest movies I've seen.  It made me laugh hard.  It tried to make me cry.  It showed me a fictional glimpse into pharmaceutical sales.  It took me back to the 90s, yet felt like it belonged in our modern age of movies.  It has funny love-making.  It has dramatic love-making.  Quite frankly, it tries to do just about everything except gratuitous violence....well, no there's a brief violent encounter too.    The bottom line is that amidst all this genre-bending and blending, there's a sweet movie in here.  By the very end, \\"Love & Other Drugs\\" actually has something to say and people worth caring about.  It just takes some crazy-ass steps to get there, and that's sure to turn off some viewers.  Every movie deserves a chance, but I won't be surprised that this solid movie (IMO) will take too long to find what most audiences hope to see from a talented director like Edward Zwick (\\"Glory\\", \\"The Last Samurai\\") and a beautiful cast that includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, and perhaps one too many women that take their clothes off.    The story is a bit tough to explain, but I'll try.  Jamie (played by Gyllenhaal) is a man with no direction, bouncing from one woman and one job to the next.  When he gives pharmaceutical sales work a try, it turns out he has a knack for it.  Along the way, he meets Maggie (played by Hathaway), a Parkinsons patient who feels understandably violated when he poses as an intern during a sales visit, but eventually coerces him into a casual sex relationship.  Like just about every movie that involves impersonal sexual relationships, things eventually get complicated.  Will you be able to predict where the story goes?  The start & finish perhaps, but the journey from end to end is pretty unusual.  Along the way, you meet Jamie's annoying/hilarious brother (you'll have to decide for yourself which one he is).  There's a jealous ex-boyfriend, sales competition, discussions involving real-life drugs like Viagra, and a whole lotta sex.    You'll have to forgive me if you notice I've typed a lot about the sexual nature of this romantic comedy/drama, because quite frankly, the movie throws a lot at you.  I kid you not, there are literally at least 7 graphic scenes involving nudity and/or lovemaking, and a few more implied encounters.  What is the point of all this sex?  Am I supposed to laugh at it?  Observe distantly?  Masturbate to it?  Your guess is as good as mine with some of these sequences.  I'm not saying graphic sex is a bad thing in movies --- hell, I love \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", \\"Mulholland Drive\\", and the TV show \\"Tell Me You Love Me\\".  My problem is that \\"Love & Other Drugs\\" doesn't need to push as far as it does.  I think director Zwick really misread the fine line between honesty and softcore pornography.  This is a great shock because he co-produced the great TV show \\"Thirtysomething\\", which handled adult relationships about as honestly and delicately as any other TV or film drama.    But I've let my criticisms run amock, because even though I'm not 'recommending' it to people, I still think it's a solid movie.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have are gifted actors with terrific chemistry, and the supporting cast is very good, especially the funny Oliver Platt as Jamie's mentor & Hank Azaria as Jamie's most sought-after client.  The plot moves at a breezy pace and never bored me, even if some of is totally unnecessary.  The movie needlessly spends some time with Jamie's family, and none of it pays off except for some arguable laughs from Josh Gad's love-him (ME) or hate-him (YOU?) performance as Jamie's brother.  But when all is said and done, watching Gyllenhaal and Hathaway tell the story of a couple's ups-and-downs moved me.    The best thing you can do with a movie is say how it made you feel.  \\"Love & Other Drugs\\" made me chuckle quite a bit, and warmed my heart a little.  Hope that helps, because I don't think there's anything else quitelike this one.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|It took me a while to stop gazing at the beautiful woman on the cover of this CD.  It took me even longer to get passed the first three tracks.  Every time I heard \\"Where You At,\\" I had to hear it again.  Her interpretation of R. Kelly's lyrics is just plain magical.  And what a voice.  After that, it's just a musical joyride that you don't want to end.  There's just nothing not to like about this woman.  This collection of music raises the bar that's going to be hard to surpass.  Think young Aretha Franklin.  That's how gifted I believe Ms. Hudson is.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|The first thing you have to do is lower your expectations of this film. It's not 300. And it's not Watchmen. Those are two phenomenal films based off of someone else's intellectual property. This is Zack Snyder's own, and in many ways it's unfair to compare Sucker Punch to those two films. What Sucker Punch is is pure exploitation; it's piled to the brim with over-the-top action sequences, and has as much fan-service as an old Burlesque film.<br /><br />Sucker Punch follows the Alice-in-Wonderland-like adventures of Babydoll, a twenty-year-old girl who is having the worst week of her life. Her mother has just died, and her and her sister must face a future with her stepfather. Babydoll's stepfather, a dispicable man, finds out that all of his wife's possessions were left to the two girls, and this sends him into a rage. The result of this rage puts Babydoll into a mental hospital where the orderlies have taken control. Now Babydoll faces lobotomy if she can't find a way to escape the hospital. The new world she enters completely envelopes her, and she begins her quest to find the items needed to escape her fate....<br /><br />Understand this about Sucker Punch: it's a fantasy film. That means suspending disbelief. A lot of the scenes are chaotic depictions of future or fantastic landscapes. Robo-Nazi-Zombies, Japanese demons, dragons fighting World War 2 era planes, and a future civilization on one of the moons of Jupiter can all be found in this movie. Zack Snyder takes a lot of liberties, and considering the themes of the story (rabbit-hole and mental illness), he does a fine job at conveying his action-oriented story.<br /><br />If you love 300 and Watchmen, then you should like Sucker Punch. It's filmed in the same style, gritty and oft-times violent. But if you're expecting 300 and Watchmen then no doubt you'll be disappointed. Sucker Punch's story is not a powerhouse. It's a means to drive the action of this film. It's not bad, it just isn't very substantial. Besides that, it's a very satisfying movie. One other important note: Sucker Punch has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie.ry satisfying movie. One other important note: Sucker Punch has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie.
0446678430|5.0|I recommend reading this book. I started reading it and killed it off in a week and a half (which is fast for me lol) It was very good and opened my eyes to a lot of things I just had no idea about. For example, I had been investing in the stock market like a class A rube. I'll be doing some big changes in that area. That retiring at 65 business is a giant load. I'm laying out plans to retire at 33 now that I've read this book. I think this book served as a general eye opener and road map to getting out of the rat race and into freedom sooner that most people will.

I am using it with a 8GB SD card with no problems at all    __________________________________
0553386794|5.0|I'm re-reading the book to refresh my memory in anticipation of the HBO mini-series.  Oftentimes a fondly remembered book doesn't hold up on subsequent readings, but I can't say that about Thrones.  It's one of the first epic fantasy novels I ever read and continues to be one of the best.  It has everything -- finely drawn characters, realistic dialogue, exotic (and not so exotic) locales, adventure, war, exile, magic, monsters, romance, intrigue, and mystery.  In other hands all this could be a big mess, but Martin makes it work.<br /><br />I think this would be a great first book for someone who's been considering epic fantasy but thinks it's not \\"literature\\" or even worse, thinks that it can't tell a story with characters you can relate to.  Readers of historical fiction will also appreciate this book, with its similarities to the Wars of the Roses.
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|If you're looking for music that transcends boundaries and charts new territory you won't be in the market for \\"Teenage Dream\\" (or Katy Perry for that matter) but if harmless fun and coquette lyrics are your cup of tea Perry delivers in full force. Being one of the (seemingly) few who did not care for the first single, \\"California Gurls\\", I was surprised to find this album to be a solid pop effort from the tease of today's pop music.    \\"E.T\\", \\"Circle the Drain\\", and \\"Peacock\\", are all heady and thoroughly danceable, its the tunes on which Perry shows some emotion that really work it. \\"Firework\\" is a joyous soaring anthem of self-acceptance that has been in every commerical imagineable and is saturating the market with good feelings and rainbows. It is clearly the best song on the album. \\"Teenage Dream\\" and \\"Not Like the Movies\\" make a close race for 2nd both seemingly odes to her new husband Russel Brand. The songs drip with sugar, but are not obnoxious with enough spunk and \\"awww\\" to make them fly without crashing. The crashing comes where \\"cute\\" becomes syrupy like in the case of \\"Pearl\\" and \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat.\\" Decent songs in their own right, but when matched up against the rest of the roster you begin to suffocate in all the shiny happiness and valley girl charm.    For a fun time, call upon Katy Perry. Throw your inhibitions and expectations out the door and take Perry's Teenage Dream for a spin.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|angry birds at it again. basically a reason to sign up for the Amazon App store. good graphics, smooth and fluid on stock HTC Evo 4g.
0230710077|5.0|...since Pillars of the Earth and perhaps even better. What a great book, combining fiction with historical facts. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it was over. Cannot wait for the next installment.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Like many others, I have to stress - having the full app is much, much better if you aren't using a top of the line phone. The embedded advertisements really do sap performance and can make the game lag a lot more, so it really is worth the price with regard to any app you happen to enjoy.<br /><br />The game is nice in the sense that there are new levels and a few new random objects to smash if you're one to try finding the perfect way to beat a level, but I wasn't really blown away. It's more akin to a mod, than a new version/release of a game.<br /><br />As far as in-game sounds, this might be too picky, but the new random caged bird sounds tend to drown out the more ridiculous/humorous angry bird sounds, which I found disappointing. Different, not poor quality, but worse in my mind.<br /><br />Maybe I was hoping for more than what looks to be a level pack with some new images thrown around, but if it's just a dollar, there isn't much room to complain.
B004FOA84A|5.0|It was a little too short and a little too easy, but it was a fun way to pass the time. And being an adventure game scores extra points in my book right off the bat!
B0034G4OWM|5.0|My son enjoyed watching this over and over!  It had some very funny parts and it was a clean movie.  No language.  We bought it for a good price too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is incredible....  the different translations are a huge plus but add to that all the reading plans, the ability to share in so many ways, bookmarks, notes - it's just wonderful. I couldn't recommend it more!
B004SKHJF2|3.0|All right app, does the job.      Buy why am I expected to pay for it?  It instantly offers options for me to buy any song it identifies.  Shouldn't it just support itself off affiliate programs for these sales?  Would get a 5 if it were free.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|what an improvement!  if this is any indication, i'm sold on amazon apps.  graphics are great &amp; all the issues with the original &amp; seasons are gone.  love it!
B004SKHJF2|3.0|I like shoundhound better. Its faster and gives more information. However for being free today you should deffinetly pick this up. I dont know why i have to type 25 words minimun for this review.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|fail - usa only?  take all our details then say not available. amazon have messed up here and alienated the rest of the world from their app store!
0439023521|5.0|Who would have thought that something aimed at tweens would capture my attention so well? Well-written (when so much of this genre doesn't need to be) and well-structured (ahem, same here), with characters that defy the norms yet are still admirable and aspirational. So glad I took a chance on this--only because of the buzz and wanting to read it before the movie adaptation--and as a result of now reading all 3 have spent so many happy commuting hours. Thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I haven't tried any other app that does the same thing, but this is definitely an excellent app. And the fact that it's free today even better. I removed the free version I was using and installed this one.
B0046MVVOW|3.0|Received CDs in a reasonable amount of time, and was exactly what I was expecting for a very reasonable price, with which I was very pleased with. I was however slightly disappointed in the condition the CD case was in upon arrival. All of the little \\"spokes\\" in the middle that hold the CDs in place broke off, so the CDs aren't secure in the case. I purchased this item to have as memorabilia, as I have purchased all the songs online already, so I was hoping it would be in better condition. Perhaps better packing from the company could solve the problem.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's a good pass time. Some levels are easy but you can struggle with others. It installed fine and works great on my T-mobile My-Touch 4G
B003F1WM2K|4.0|I was greatly looking forward to Patti Smith's autobiography of her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. A memoir of two of my favourite artists during a time in history that was nearly magical...can't go wrong, and I was definitely not disappointed. Smith writes with a poetry and candour that few can imitate.
B004M6BQ9W|3.0|I usually like musical movies, Grease, Selena, Purple Rain and The Five Heartbeats, just to name a few.  This movie also seemed to have all the right ingredients, yet I found myself checking my watch several times.  I think maybe the many heavy full length (non-contemporary) song and dance numbers overpowered the thin storyline. The acting was good; however I found Cher's face as distracting as Melanie Griffiths and Meg Ryan's.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Okay, I tried the 30 Day Shred for the second time last night.  It is actually a good workout.  I wear a heart rate monitor and in 25 minutes I burned 257 calories.  Thats not too bad.  I'm in relatively good shape, however I have about 20lbs to lose.  I weight train and do various types of cardio, but I wanted to try a new home DVD for when I'm short on time.  This one just might do the trick for me.  I don't actually plan to do it for 30 days straight, but I will promise to pop it in a few times per week.  I worked up a good sweat just on level one and I peaked at Level 2 just to see if I should progress sooner, but I think I'll stay at Level 1 a little while longer.:-)  Hopefully this DVD, combined with a Zumba class, a couple of days of running and weight training will yeild me the results I'm hoping for.     I believe if one commits to doing this DVD for 30 days you'll definitely see results.  You don't get bored with it, and Jillian is not annoying like some.  The girls in the video have impressive bodies unlike the Biggest Loser Cardio Max DVD I bought, so that makes it a little more motivational for me. Overrall I'm happy with the DVD and look forward to working out with it!

B004SKHJF2|3.0|Shazam Encore is an app that you would find useful on your mobile device. For instance, your at a bar and trying to figure out what song title or artist is playing on the junk box, pull out your phone to \\"shazam\\" for the artist and song title. This app is  simple to use and eliminates brain overloads while tracing back old songs and artist from previous decades that you had forgotten.     The price for the app is quite steep and $5 dollars. Once, the Amazon Appstore offered it for free so I jumped on the deal (thanks Amazon). If you don't want to pay for this app then try \\"Soundhound\\" for free which has no limit to tagging music unlike the Shazam free version.     One last note, the developers need to enable the app2SD function for those that have limited space and don't care for the use of a widget.    Henry

B002WYJHBA|5.0|Had never seen it before and made a blind purchase based on a recommendation from a trusted source.

Looks great on Blu-ray.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|Back at the turn of the 20th century (the so-called \\"American Century\\"), there was talk of the end of the American frontier, the wild blue yonder that set America apart and impelled everyone to seek their home there. Ever since that moment, there has been a search for the artistic experience which will bring back that cosmic consciousness of the land which has been lost. The great American novel. The great American film.<br /><br />While there are many candidates for the two aforementioned art forms and perhaps they have still not appeared, the great American album does exist.<br /><br />Its title is apt. It is No Other from native Missouri son Gene Clark.<br /><br />No Other is the hidden gem of that decade of malaise (the 1970s) when the dreams of the 1960s faded.<br /><br />Not only is No Other an artifact of this time which still haunts America, it is also a nostalgic looking back to an America which might never have existed in the first place. It is a paean to a lost age of innocence, recorded in a genre-defying and spiritual rush (the same rush as Astral Weeks, Spirit of Eden, Lazer Guided Melodies, A Storm in Heaven).<br /><br />What makes No Other so powerful is not only its much maligned \\"louder than God\\" Thomas Jefferson Kaye transcending the Phil Spector Wall-of-Sound production, its top session musicians of L.A., its vast soulful choir of female background vocals.<br /><br />It is Gene Clark laying his soul bare. A misunderstood Missouri man who briefly experienced the rock star fame of youth (the Byrds) and then retreated from the limelight, who was always dying from physical pain and abuse of his body through alcohol and other substances which could free him from this mortal coil.<br /><br />From the celestial country music of opener \\"Life's Greatest Fool\\" with its wise and world-weary observations \\"Formed out of pleasure/Chiseled by pain\\" & \\"Children laugh and run away/While others look into the darkness of the day\\" to the poetic and poignant closer \\"Lady of the North\\", containing one of the greatest guitar solos of all time at the end, soaring heavenward straight to the eye of God, this truly is the great American album.Lady of the North\\", containing one of the greatest guitar solos of all time at the end, soaring heavenward straight to the eye of God, this truly is the great American album.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|The shallow merits of The Tourist do little to remedy its paper-thin characterization, forgettable score, mismatched actors, and chronic identity crisis.  It is appropriately titled, however, in that the plot was no doubt contrived on a $14 coffee coaster in San Marco while the cast 'toured' Venice.  Meanwhile, the director incorporated a few mildly humorous segments of (PJ clad) Depp braving the Hotel Deniali rooftop, and runway model Jolie slaloming Venetian 'campos' like an Energizer powered Barbie doll.  The drum and French poodle were all that was missing.  Furthermore, the unremarkable script was saturated with clich&eacute;s and predictable eventualities, which conspired to poison the already non-existent chemistry between Depp and Jolie.  Even worse, the attempted blend of comedy, espionage, and Summertime(esque) romance only cannibalized its individual components and added to the confusion.  The effect was glitz and kitsch, not glamour and thrill.  The film also failed to showcase those subtle elements that make Venice the most awe-inspiringly romantic city in the world.  The result is a \\"cinematic experience\\" that utilized for its backgrounds shop-bought Venetian postcards.<br /><br />To be fair, there were a few witty lines like the \\"ravenous/ravishing\\" pre-dinner exchange.  Good stuff.  Had they been faithful to this lighthearted, comedic prescription and axed the absurd spy vs. spy subplot, the movie would have been more memorable.  Ironically, Timothy Dalton's minor role--owing to his ageless appearance and former work as 007--seemed to steal the show.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a believable romance that truly captures the essence/charm of Venice, go rent David Lean's Summertime, starring Katherine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi.

045122499X|4.0|Mr. Follett has done it again with this sort-of sequel to \\"The Pillars of the Earth.\\"  Taking us back to Kingsbridge, the fictional Medieval English town of the previously mentioned book, two centuries later, Mr. Follett weaves a wonderful tale of life in the 14th century.  Yet, unlike \\"Pillars,\\" there is no cathedral or other similar architectural achievement that unifies the whole story.  Sure, it starts with a bridge collapse just as \\"Pillars\\" started with the destruction of a cathedral, but the rebuilding of the bridge doesn't take long and it doesn't consume too much of the story.  So, what made me devour this book as greedily as Mr. Follett's previous Kingsbridge novel?  Once I started thinking of this not as a sequel to \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" (and, in a way, it isn't) I finally came up with the answer: this novel is about the change, transition.  While the Priory of Kingsbridge has remained somewhat unchanged in its orthodoxy from the previous novel, the citizens have.  And when the Plague arrives (not much of a spoiler if you know anything about Europe in this period), that change is accelerated.  Mr. Follett, perhaps better than any history textbook ever could, conveys the societal earthquake the Plague caused as England begins to slowly transitions into its Renaissance era.  And that is what made me read this book with such gusto.  I couldn't give it five stars for two reasons: first, the amount of sex in the book felt a little excessive.  In fact, once the story really picked up pace around the 150 page mark, I couldn't go 20 pages without someone getting some action.  Sure, it made sense with the overall story and didn't step over the line into the prurient, but it still felt like too much.  Second, Gwenda's whole storyline, while interesting especially at the beginning, felt kind of useless to the overall story line by the end.  Sure, it has a satisfying twist at the end, but Mr. Follett might have been able to save some pages by leaving it out.  Inthe end, though, this was a great read, a fine successor to \\"The Pillars of the Earth,\\" and I hope that Starz makes this into a miniseries too.

B000000OPZ|5.0|In 1987, after a couple of years layoff, Whitesnake slammed back into the rock scene with their self-titled record. Quite a few people list this as Whitesnake's sellout album, but give this monster a couple listens, and i'm sure you'll agree this is one of the decades best.<br /><br />The only downside to this album is that, it only has nine tracks on it. However, don't let that deter you from giving it a try. This album is a little different than previous Whitesnake offerings in that it mixes a more pop-metal feel to it, all the while keeping with Coverdale's love of the blues. The obvious draw to this album is the anthemic rocker \\"Here I Go Again,\\" but the rest of the record is equally as good. Songs like \\"Still Of The Night,\\" \\"Give Me All Your Love Tonight,\\" \\"Bad Boys\\" and \\"Is This Love\\" make this an absolute must for any fan of the genre.<br /><br />I can't brag about being a monster Whitesnake fan, I can't even say their one of my favorite from the 80's, but with their self-titled album they definitely grabbed my attention. This is easily one of the decades best.

B000002ILG|5.0|\\"Pride\\" was White Lion's 1987 major label debut album. After releasing an independant album earlier in the decade, White Lion finally got their big chance, and man did they ever make the most of it.<br /><br />One of the most captiviting reasons to love this album is the absolutely stellar guitar playing from Vito Bratta. The lush harmonies, beautiful melodies, and socially conscious lyrics also make Pride a bit stronger than the average hair metal release of the 1980's. Like I stated previously, \\"Pride\\" is easily one of the best records of the '80s, heck, it's one of the best records ever released! That's not only my opinion, you just go ask anyone who likes hard rock from the 1980's and i'm sure they'll readily agree.<br /><br />Soundwise White Lion stands alone, you may say they sound like every other party metal band, but this simply isn't true. I know people will say they ripped off everything they could to achieve success, but this again simply isn't correct. Do they have similarities to other bands of the time? Sure they do, but who didn't borrow from each other during the '80s? While they have their own unique sound and blend, White Lion melded the best of everything from the hair metal genre onto one teriffic album. Every single track could have hit the top-ten, and not one song weighs this record down. Songs like \\"Hungry,\\" \\"Sweet Little Loving,\\" \\"Wait,\\" \\"Lady Of The Valley,\\" \\"All Join Our Hands\\" and \\"When The Children Cry\\" are all first-rate pop metal songs, and easily make this album must-have!<br /><br />I'll say this to all fans of 80's metal who do not currently have this album, go buy this record as fast as you can muster the speed. This is truely one of the best of the entire genre, and there is no way, and I mean absolutely no way, that this record will be viewed as anything less than amazing!

B004GHBQ7O|4.0|Greenday are one of the best live bands of all time and Awesome As F**k is their newest live DVD and CD combo documenting their 21st Century Breakdown World Tour. Having seen Greenday live 5 times over the past 15 years in a range of venues ranging from 500 capacity to 40,000 capacity I can tell you that their live energy is amazing and their performances are always superb. This show in Tokyo is a killer set with all the Greenday live trademarks and intense showmanship backed up by a great set list and quality production. There's a few nice tracks to keep long time fans happy including \\"Cigarettes And Valentines\\", \\"Going To Pasalacqua\\", and \\"Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?\\" in addition to the obligatory hits from their two recent albums that have been worldwide phenomenons. Awesome As F**k is definitely recommended to all Greenday fans and sets them up as legends of the rock world...as if they weren't already after all they've achieved. By the way, check out the killer drumming from Tre Cool - astounding playing from a human metronome.

0307454886|2.0|I had the good fortune of discovering Bellow before Philip Roth. It saved me a lot of tedious reading.<br /><br />But I took a chance on The Dying Animal because of my affection for Elegy, a lovely film based on the book. Sadly--unlike the movie--the novel suffers from the same shortcoming that ruins all of Roth's books for me: the overwhelming sense that they've been constructed to show me the light.<br /><br />The bully-pulpit characterized most of my early reading--not uncommon for an American reader, I suppose, especially one who grew up, as I did, in a religious home. In flight from the pulpit I discovered the novel. In Augie March, in all the great novels of my adolescence--Huck Finn, Crime and Punishment, Heart of Darkness--I heard for the first time the voice of uncertainty.<br /><br />My god, it was so lovely, the Novel's not-knowing. That loveliness gave me permission to be curious. It gave me permission to love the world.<br /><br />I read novels less than ever, now, sadly. If you're still reading them, don't bother with this one.

And if you've got an open soul--that's a hell of an \\"if\\"--and if you're lucky enough to meet your Mick Jagger, and if by some miracle you manage to remain alive despite the dangers of your own openness, you might make for the rest of us something that matters.<br /><br />While I was reading this wonderful memoir--which is less about girls and drugs (although they're in there) than about the working life of an artist--I was reminded of a question by the German poet Durs Gr&uuml;nbein:<br /><br />\\"I don't want to frighten you, but have you ever thought about what happens to people who aren't artists?\\"<br /><br />Keith Richards spared himself that terror. If you want a glimpse into the cost of that calling--the highest calling that we can call a profession--then give his book a long listen. Like his music, it's worth every minute.

B001RTSPVY|4.0|The first season of 'Breaking Bad' was easily one of the most addicting shows on TV. The story of a high school teacher, 'Walt' who's diagnosed with a serious case of cancer and finds his calling in the drug-trade is hard to resist. This second season of 'Breaking Bad' is just as addictive with an even longer season (13 episodes) but sometimes takes a bit too much for granted.<br /><br />The story of 'Breaking Bad' season two picks up exactly where season one left off. Walt and his former student Jesse have gone into business with drug dealer Tuco and end up getting in way over their heads, even as their drug gives them a strong rep on the streets. Adding to this both Walt and Jesse's personal lives are becoming deeply effected, especially Walt's relationship with his wife and son. The one thing I love about this show is how nothing Walt and Jesse (and any of the other characters) do or scheme is without consequence and watching their plans 'almost' succeed or change in unpredictable ways is a pure delight. Unfortunately as well thought-out as the episode's plots are, the credibility is stretched pretty thin to service the plot: characters start behaving unbelievably, certain situations play out in ways that you KNOW isn't possible (even in the show's sense) and the plots follow a few too many red-herrings (which don't seem to have much point). The dark sense of humor is still intact, but the sinking likability of characters will no doubt test the dedication of some fans.<br /><br />Like the first season, this DVD set of Breaking Bad season 2 comes with some great extras. The usual behind the scenes features are there with some fun gag reels. The best addition is the hilarious \\"webisodes\\" which were originally only available (free) online.<br /><br />The same strengths of the first season of 'Breaking Bad' are here with stellar acting by the entire cast and some engagingly gritty scenes of violence and the drug-world. While I felt season 2 wasn't as satisfying as the first, this DVD set is still a must-buy and won't disappoint fans.t is still a must-buy and won't disappoint fans.
1594202842|1.0|Completely separate from the substance of the book, I found Amy Chua's reading of it disappointing.   I was frequently reaching for the volume control as she alternated between too quiet and too loud.  And, I found her pronunciation of the words \\"couldn't\\" and \\"didn't\\" (pronounced by Chua as coon't and din't) a bit grating.  I don't understand why she didn't get a professional voice actor to read it.  They can't be that expensive.

B0034G4P7G|2.0|Once you get past the annoying conversation and through the credits and plan to settle on intriguing film of history and success, you will find to your chagrin a blas&eacute; pre-court give-and-take conversation, a long conversation, a monotone conversation, a dragged out conversation. It seems like hours of monologue with a dash of dialog thrown in. As the ending credits roll up you realize that all he did was talk and talk and talk.<br /><br />Of course if you like long boring conversations this is a great movie and a perfect representation of one great big long diatribe that starts from nowhere and goes to nowhere. On the positive side the music was nice and the period costumes were up to acceptable.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray.  I'm not sure they made anything other than Blu-ray. There are the standard scene selections, languages special features, and whatnot however none of them really contribute to this presentation. You might want to listen the audio commentary to see what they were trying to do.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I like history's I like biographies but  this was really wasn't history or biography.

B004J4WQ46|5.0|The first two The Strokes albums are classics, both Is This It and Room on Fire were among the best albums released in the 2000's. Angles holds its own vs both of those. If this were a band that came out of nowhere, it would be praised more, but there are a lot of reasons besides the music to dislike the Strokes - the initial hype of Is This It, their high class backgrounds, their good looks. Aside from good, but not always awesome lyrics, this band has no weaknesses. Angles might suffer slightly from the \\"fractured\\" recording sessions, but if nothing else, Angles shows that they still have it, and that their ceiling is a lot higher than some of their critics once believed. The Strokes is the Nirvana of the 2000's, except they never blew up like Nirvana because they had Velvet Underground aspirations and refused to play the game. We are lucky they are around. Instrumentally, they hold their own vs any other band. In terms of style, they are unique. Angles is not perfect, but it is a fresh The Strokes album - that is all you need to know. Like Rolling Stone said, The Strokes invented their own brand of rock, ignited a new era of rock, and in time they will be remembered as one of the classics. If you haven't liked them before, you might dig some of the new sounds in Angles, but it is a total Strokes album and album of the year so far in 2011.

It focuses in on a man who inherited a position of royalty, although he in himself did not have the confidence or ability to lead through public speaking, let alone with family & friends.

B004GHBQ7O|5.0|I'm an old school Green Day fan - having seen them on the Nimrod tour in a room that was a little over 250 people, then again on American Idiot and then this tour.  No matter the size of the room Green Day manages to deliver - as demonstrated in this video.  Green Day is an awesome live show - better than captured herein.  I really like that they selected songs that were not on \\"Bullet in a Bible\\" (for the most part).      If you're new to Green Day pick up American Idiot, Dookie, Nimrod and 21st Century Breakdown.  This will give you the best of their work - and it is a powerful display of power-punk. Once you've experienced those masterpieces you can the settle into \\"Awesome as F**k\\" and \\"Bullet in a Bible\\" and understand how heartfelt the music is and how honestly it is delivered live.       Lastly - Tre - dude - time to lay off the donuts...

0312600844|5.0|We don't love all good books for the same reason.  Freedom and The Corrections will both be among my most memorable reads for the same reason.  The author has a knack for illustrating and describing the newest aspects of American culture, the small, new shadings of thought and attitudes in our current lives.  It's thrilling and a little embarassing to know our little secrets are out.  And he uncovers them so clearly, it is a little startling, and occasionally I had to pause and wonder at the revelations that should have been obvious to me, since they are present in everyday life.  The characters and plot of this book are just frameworks to display the beautiful writing.  It's true that Freedom is not as funny as The Corrections, and that in many ways it is a second volume of that book, but funny AND profound books are very rare, and I think it we are lucky to to have any books which are either.  I'm looking forward to the third volume.  Hope it doesn't take another 10 years.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I absolutely love this show! Besides True Blood, this is my favorite show on television right now. I don't have cable at the moment, so I brought season 1 and was immediately hooked. I then went out and brought season 2, finished that and brought season 3. I have completed season 3 and I can't wait to go out and buy season 4. I'm always on the edge of my seat wondering how Dexter is going to get out of the situations he finds himself in. He's always about to get caught, but somehow continues to evade getting caught in his murderous acts. I definitely recommend starting from season 1 and watching in order to get the history and really appreciate the show.

B001N26GFM|5.0|I went into watching this movie knowing the storyline and knowing all about the Holocaust, I grew up in a Jewish family knowing all the terror of what happend with Hitler's rein during World War II.  This movie helped me explain to my 10 year old daughter about the good and bad and people.  Ironically she compared this movie to the slaves of the Civil War, however as I told her the Slaves were treated much better than the Jewish people during World War II.  This movie from start to finish is incredible, I did cry at the end of this movie for I had heard of the endinng prior to watching the movie, and I had heard of the horror of the work camps first hand from friends who were in Europe during Hitler's rein.  Sadly after watching this, I do wonder why no member of The Academy never acknowledged this film.  The actors were all first class, the screen play was great.  I just wish the movie wasn't based upon a true scenario of the 20th century.  This movie helps heal those who lost loved ones and helps us explain to our young children of the 21st century this should never happen again.  This movie is a must see for anyone trying to explain to children the awful rein of Adolph Hitler and his followers.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|I had already become a follower of Will Smith when I saw this movie, and at this point I knew he could both be funny and also serious.  I loved him in The Legend Of Bagger Vance, I loved Independence Day and loved both Men In Black Movies.  I went into this movie not knowing who Chris Gardner was, Will Smith is an amazing actor.  This movie showed him overcome any obstacle that comes his way.  I cried watching him tough it out, its also nice to see that good guys do finish first.  This movie is a must have for anyone who wants a feel good movie.  You may shed some tears but they are tears of happyness.  I just wish the Academy could of given him the Oscar for Best Actor and this movie the award for Best Picture.  Will Smith keep making 1st class movies and I will be your biggest follower.
B003YL4L0W|1.0|I have read all of Picoult's books. This one just did not do it for me. It read more like a research book rather than a well put together novel. I just could not get a feeling for the characters. I learned a lot though with all the research Picoult did on the  Gay/Lesbian community and music therapy. Overall a very disappointing read. Go back to your old style Jodi!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!  The graphics as well as the sound effects are great.  Even my parrot loves this game.  Give it a try!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|No problems at all installing or running the game. Oh, by the way the game is awesome! Better graphics, new environments and enemies. Best Angry Birds yet no doubt. NO ADS is a huge bonus as well.
B004GYY714|5.0|Just stumbled upon this app and I'm glad I did. Started by looking for my local stations. The app listed all of them along with the current song or show. Quality isn't as good as OTA, but not too shabby. 5 stars in my book.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|What do you get when you mix New Wave British Metal with German march choruses, sprinkle in a little Thrash and even a little early 80's Glam Metal? You get the best metal album in the last 10 years to hit the Metal scene. There's no let up on this album. From the double bass drums thumping of the opening cut, \\"Beat the Bastards\\" to the last cut, \\"Bucket Full of Hate\\", with its thundering medieval sounding choruses, you'll be \\"white knuckling\\" it all the way. This album is blistering from beginning to end in the old style of classic metal. Also, don't let the cliche sounding titles deceive you. These are very well written songs that appear to be directed at an older more mature crowd who have experienced a little in the modern world. \\"Blood of Nations\\" itself is a patriotic song.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great application with multiple versions for text and audio. It's free so you can't lose. A Christian Church has sponsored and developed this application, and so many are blessed by their ministry. God's Word is such a gift!
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Should Have More Features Like iPhone Version. Also Should Let Us Sign Into Shazam Account To Allow Storage Of Tagged Songs And Such. Customizable Tweets Would Be Good To...
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love Rio! It runs so much faster and better than the previous ones. My only complaint is Amazon's Appstore App. It's required to be installed on your phone, which is bad for me, because that app causes my phone to lock-up and can only be fixed by taking the battery out and putting it back in. It's pretty ridiculous that a faulty app has to be installed for another app to work.
B004DN3VEM|2.0|Wow - really disappointed with this long-anticipated Deluxe edition of one of my favorite collections of Rainbow - hell, any band - songs of all time.  Two discs feature a regurgitation or the same7 tracks appearing on the original album with no material, discernable difference as the songs cross from the NY - LA - Raw - versions.  The liner notes are the only redeeming virtue of this set.  Nothing new here, I'm afraid.  If you have the original album, stand pat on this Deluxe edition;  if you don't own this classic album, save yourself a buck and procure the less expense base version.
159420229X|5.0|Joshua Foer is an amazing writer. This book is entertaining, enthralling, and informational all at once. Foer delves into memory and what it means to remember, covering topics ranging from ancient Greek memory techniques to the real Rain Man to philosophical musings about the importance of memory in education. His writing style is playful at times, serious at other times, but always eloquent and elegant. I am not a writer, and I cannot do justice to Foer's writing with this review, but rest assured that this book will open your mind and expand your horizons. I strongly recommend this title to all readers.
B0009A40ES|5.0|After putting it off for a long time, I finally decided to watch this movie. I haven't read the book, don't really know what the story is all about and if the book is anything like the movie then I gotta tell ya it is a pretty disturbing book. Cuz, this movie was a very disturbing account of a psychotic serial killer's life. It almost felt like reading a journal of a crazy stalker who's completely messed up in the mind except watching it in 3D.<br /><br />Patrick Batmen (Christian Bale) is a wealthy Newyorker who works as a vice president in a big company. He lives in a multi million dollar apartment, he's extremely obsessed with his looks (and given the way Christian Bale looks in this film I really can't blame him), he graduated from Harvard, loves women, sex and music. Basically, he's your typical Rich New York business man who's very arrogant and hard to like, nothing wrong with that, However what most people don't know is that appearances can be deceiving even more than often. The truth is, what most people don't know and what Patrick tries so hard to keep them ignorant and well succeed is that he's completely \\"psycho\\". I don't mean that as a phrase, no, he is literary \\"Psycho\\". Patrick not only is extremely paranoid, and on more than one occasion OCD about his looks. He also loves to go around, in the dark, wander the streets and pick up people, take them to his apartment and then torture them before brutally killing them on the spot and deposing of the body. Talking about guilty pleasure huh ? Apparently, Patrick can't help it. He have these unexplained urges to kill and kill and make people feel the pain and it has gotten so out of control to the point that Patrick is scared of it himself.<br /><br />I have to tell you, this movie left me paranoid, thinking of crazy serial killers coming out of no where. Pretty scary and sick too. After watching this, I truly understood why parents always tell their kids not to go out with strangers. I'm no longer a kid but I'll never go out with a stranger ! Even if he was as good looking as Christian Bale. Talking about Christian Bale, his performance was Amazing ! The only reason that made me give this movie a 5 instead of a 4, I mean that's just How impressed I was. He totally deserved at least an Oscar Nomination. I don't know who won the Oscar that year but the Oscar committee is gonna be watching this in a couple of years and they're gonna be really sorry for not giving it to him.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie, \\"But\\" and a big emphasize on \\"BUT\\" only if you have an open mind, doesn't freak out on blood and gore (cuz this movie had quite a little and I think some may have issues with that), doesn't mind the drugs and the sex scenes (the drugs weren't as much but the sex scenes..hmm they were revealing even for a Hollywood movie so if you have kids at home don't watch this with your family. I don't know about this cuz I saw the uncut version but the cut version (theoretical release) is still rated a strict (NC-17) which means that you have to be at least 17 to watch this movie.<br /><br />Anyhow, Great acting, Great filmography, Great directing and I liked the dialog this movie is very quotable. The premise is however disturbing with a Capital D if you have anxiety or get nervous you may not be able to sleep so it's better to stay away from this movie. Oh, I don't wanna spoil anything but the ending left me curious but satisfied.out with a stranger ! Even if he was as good looking as Christian Bale.

B003W5C0VW|5.0|The Stones at their raunchiest, creative best!!! The Mick Taylor & Keith interaction is the best and their best work came from this period. I love the later stuff too, but this is when they were absolutely at their peak.I was only about 6 yrs old when this tour happpened so this is the only way for me to experience those days. I've seen Gimme Shelter too and this is more just them & the stage, not as much crowd & back story.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|Note: I wrote an original review for the film only way back when I saw it, which was actually on opening day.  Now that I have acquired the Blu-Ray version of Sucker Punch, I will write a review.  My consensus though is to purchase the Blu-Ray package over the DVD, so if you just want to read my thoughts on the movie, skip this section.  I will review the Blu-Ray.  If you are wanting to know everything about the layout and the general features, Amazon is correct with both product descriptions, so you can trust them.<br /><br />When I first saw Sucker Punch in theaters, the art direction, CGI, and the colors was absolutely jaw dropping; this was one of the movies that I could see blasting on my TV screen. Well, I am happy to report that Sucker Punch looks and sounds terrific on Blu-Ray.  Given the sensory overload Sucker Punch provides, one can only imagine how the potential of the , and the transfer does its justice and brings Sucker Punch to complete life upon your HD TV.  The picture is crystal clear and sharp, which gives way to an absolutely dazzling high definition picture on screen.  Sucker Punch's intense colors, elaborate architecture, and stylized visuals all come to life onscreen, with a visual intensity on the same boat as any high production value video game would be able to achieve (Think Uncharted 2 or God of War 3.  Sucker Punch can surely compete with both games in terms of visual splendor).  All the little details of the visual intensity absolutely stand out and are crystal clear.  You can see everything little snow-flake, bit of explosion, and piece of dust, yet the little details don't substantiate the stylized and beautiful landscape and architecture.  I give the picture an easy 10.  It looks absolutely amazing.  So safe to say, it is ABSOLUTELY worth buying for television viewing.<br /><br />The audio is not quite as impressive as the picture of the film (seems fitting, however, given the visual approach to the film), but the sound is no slouch either (I think this has to do with the fact that the Sound design by default is not as good as, say, Saving Private Ryan or Lord of the Rings).  Sucker Punch will still work out your home theater system, so if you have a great sound system, it's time to watch Sucker Punch with it.  The movie really takes advantage of the DTS Sound track, as you will be able to hear the explosions surround you, the bullets clanking, whizzing, and whining and all around you, and the adjacent sound effects to the visual keys that Zack Snyder is so fond of using is crystal clear and satisfying.  Your theater will rumble, and you will be totally surrounded by the immersive sound to really match the whole movie.  What else could you ask for?  I give the sound a 10, although the sound design is a 9.<br /><br />As most of you already know, the Blu-Ray version of Sucker Punch adds 18 minutes to the movie.  This is a whole 18 minutes of new film footage. More dialogue is added to certain scenes, and while they really don't radically make the story better in a way, it does add some fluency and color to the movie.  These add more color and life to the characters and situations.  There is also more action to make those peaks and valleys of the action more effective, and there are a couple more graphic shots to the action scenes, as there is a bit more gore.  There is also the cut scene that Snyder had to remove (which deals with a sexual encounter),  The most prominent addition to the film is a eye catching and theatrical musical number, and it doesn't at all tone down the pure visual and aural onslaught the movie previously had.  I'm not going to give out spoilers but the is worth seeing and makes the movie even more of a blast than it was in theaters.  Really, what else can you ask for?<br /><br />As far as the rest of the special features go, here they are.<br /><br />Maximum Movie Moment with Zack Snyder: The informative and fun special feature from the Watchmen Blu-Ray returns for anotherround, with Zack Snyder stepping out of the director's chair to give us more insight as to how the film was made, all interactive and almost feels hands-on to an extent.  In the Maximum Movie Moment, Zack Snyder discusses how certain interesting and intricate shots and portions of the film were made, which really satisfy the question of \\"How did they film that?\\".  He is not on-screen the whole time, but there's more than enough useful information to make the feature very worthwhile and awesome.  In addition, some sketches and storyboards are thrown into the mix.  Zack Snyder really shows how, and with something as interesting and useful as what he does with MMM, who needs it?<br /><br />*Sucker Punch: Behind the Soundtrack-A somewhat interesting mini-feature regarding the unique and stylistically interesting sound track.  Unfortunately, it's wait too short.  Giving the short running time (only 3 minutes), Zack Snyder and and company do not go into much detail when it comes to the soundtrack.  They basically just give a loose overview of how they came up with the soundtrack.  That's it.  Sure, it's interesting, but honestly, however, it's not a must see special feature.<br /><br />*Four motion comics: These four \\"comics\\" remind me of a moving graphic novel of sorts.  I think they are not substantial, but they do give background and interesting that further flesh out parts of the film.  On the downside, each of them are only 3-4 minutes, and there are only four of them.  At least they cut to the chase, which, actually, may strengthen their impact.<br /><br />In addition, the Blu-Ray Combo pack, as you can tell, also comes with a Digital copy and a DVD of the theatrical release (NOT a Blu-Ray version).  Be quick though with the Digital copy; however, as all of the digital copies I have owned eventually expire.<br /><br />Finally, should you get Blu-Ray or DVD?  As mentioned before, I do not own the DVD, however, my best advice would be to spend the extra money on the Blu-Ray version of the movie.  The Sucker Punch DVD is a bit too bare bones, as the two special feature that the DVD have the run time of less than 20 minutes.  Another nail in the coffin when it comes to the two is that the price of the Blu-Ray is not much greater than the DVD.  Personally, I would recommend springing for the Blu-Ray version, hands down.  If you do not own a Blu-Ray player and have no intention of ever getting one, I can see why one could settle for the DVD.  But if you in any way have a choice between the two, I would recommend spring for the Blu-Ray version for sure.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />After being disappointed with Battle: LA in theaters a couple weeks ago, I crossed my fingers and hoped that Sucker Punch would be the good Spring movie that kicks a major amount of @$$, like Kick @$$ did last year.  Well, I put my trust in Zack Synder, and he didn't disappoint.  Sucker Punch has got some critical backlash, but what for?  Who cares anyway?  Sucker Punch, with thrilling action, a massive scope, the patented Zack Snyder style of film making, and absolutely GORGEOUS imagery sensory overload, make this film a must see.  It also happens to have some actual decent acting (well, a little over the top, but for this movie it makes sense) and a plot that actually not half brain dead.<br /><br />So what is this movie about anyway?  Well Sucker Punch, while not totally original (the film conjures up many other works as influences, such as Alice in Wonderland, Philip K. Dick, and The Matrix), is a film that blends themes such as freedom, reality, identity, the power of imagination, and escapism, among other things.  Sucker Punch is a film that deals with a young girl who is framed for murder, and is about to experience a lobotomy.  Given five days of her sanity, she then makes a list of things she needs to escape the institution.  Through dancing in order to distract certain members of the mental institution/brothel to get the things she needs to escape (yes, you read that right), she teams up with four other patients to escape the place they have been held in.<br /><br />Character development, I'll admit, is pretty sparse here.  You pretty much know the characters themselves very quickly, and there's nothing too revealing or deep about them.  Thankfully though, the film manages to make the characters interesting and likable, thanks to the acting.  Sure, you don't find any Oscar winning performances here, but I think it works by just letting the actresses and actors just act like, well human beings, and it's very much present here (that is, if people actually pay attention).  I actually think this work better than trying to add a bunch of stupid back stories that we've all heard a million times before; a cheap way to try to humanize a character if you ask me.  Snyder is also able to milk the likability of these young actresses to make, them, well, likable, so for all of it's positive aspects characters are not really a problem.  As long as you are not expecting the character study that Snyder's Watchmen was a couple years ago, there won't be much problem here.<br /><br />Sucker Punch, also, has a very emotional undercurrent to it's dilemmas, which was all the more powerful and effective.  There's something about the motives of these people and what they are doing that really gives the film the various subtexts it needs, no small feet there.  Sure, it's still an action film at heart, but Sucker Punch does leave quite a bit to talk about, and no harm can come from that.  All well and good, but that's not even the best part of the movie.....<br /><br />The best part though, is this film is a VISUAL medium no halls barred.  I've seen three Snyder films, and Sucker Punch outclasses both 300 AND Watchmen.  Snyder sure knows how to really use the visual film medium, and Sucker Punch holds nothing back.  Iconic slow motion everywhere, massive sweeping cinematography, and a unique melding of aesthetic make Sucker Punch have more visual delights in one film that the most of the other bid budget films released every year do combined.  Most importantly, Snyder has a sense of wonder and awe that so many countless big budget action films are sorely lacking, the imagery forces your to look on.  I must have sat in the theater with my jaw dropped the whole two hours.  From huge castles and dragons, dark and grimy asylum halls, Gothic WW1 wastelands with zombies, to a truly awesome futuristic land of trains, futuristic cities set in a galaxy next to a planet.  In addition, music and sound also plays a integral role as well, with tons of great sound effects, and a soundtrack with songs from Jefferson Airplane, Pixies, and The Beatles filtered through a dark, almost cyberpunk type of aesthetic, as sweeping as the imagery on screen.  Indeed, everything about the film making is first rate.<br /><br />The elaborate worlds that Babydoll and company are thrust into are amazing to look at. Massive, eclectic, and designed with incredible detail, Snyder did not stop at all in making truly immersible and jaw dropping worlds. Add that with Snyder's great use of music, and you got one heck of a great movie experience. These worlds are as imaginative as you would expect from any Grade A video game, and Snyder doesn't hold anything back in his head. You won't get any lukewarm art design when these action scenes hit the screen (in case you haven't figured it out, all the action scenes are in their head). Speaking of the action, it's, for a lack of a better word, absolutely thrilling. It's just as good as you would expect from Snyder. Massive monster fights from cool looking Samurais to dragons, lot's of guns, huge explosions, heart stopping action that feels like it can pirouette on a dime, it's all here and more. It doesn't let up the intensity either, and each one is a roller coaster ride of sheer movie delight. It has all the giddy thrill you would get from watching movies such as Transformers,300 (yes, same director I know), or Kill Bill (although obviously not R rated), so that's a big compliment on Snyder's part.<br /><br />Alright, if my rambling hasn't convinced you already that this movie is worth seeing, then you might as well skip it.  Ignore the critical backlash Sucker Punch has received.  It's totally worth seeing.  It's clear that Zack Snyder always takes pride in his films and loves making them to make them, and it shines through here.  As long as you are not expecting Andrei Rublev or a Mike Leigh film, you should at least go into the movie knowing what you are going to get.  Sucker Punch, thanks to the visionary and imaginative directing of Zack Snyder, is easily an action film that, well, beats out the competition.  Recommended.ce they have been held in.

B003Y5H4SO|4.0|A deep psychological thriller with the \\"Actual\\" Devil being the main character !! The problem is figuring out whom he/she is !! I took a chance on this one having not seen it first. However, it was well worth the price and play's as good as brand new. I continue getting deal after deal from Amazon, and am all the better for it. This is not your typical Demon, Ghost, Possession movie you usually watch. This one is a \\"Whodunit\\" from the beginning to the end ; ) I highly recommend this movie, as it may give you a different perspective about the Devil, and his existence. This movie will make you think. Like the Sixth Sense M. Night continues to push out extraordinary movies, and this one is no different !!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|It's not as good as the REAL angry birds. It's not very challenging and I can't figure out the blue birds' function.  Most importantly, it seems to crash a lot.

B004S5D3B6|1.0|Too much reality.  I guess I just don't like these kinds of movies.  I don't like watching crack atticts.  I don't like to watch what really happens in life.  I like to escape in movies and to be entertained, not be brought down.  Though it has a good ending, most of it concntrates on family fights and drug addiction.  Not the movie for me.
0061537969|5.0|This is a wonderful and unforgettable book.  The protagonist is a young man with a burning desire to be a professional race car driver who gets diverted by life's stresses.  Facing the worst kind of heartbreaking traumas, he deals with them as best he can.  His faithful companion dog helps him through all these transitions, and the dog's life story is just as engaging as the man's.  Some of the images and scenes are so vividly presented that they have remained with me for over a year.  The scene with the 'evil zebra' has become a catch phrase among my friends to describe those moments when we simply lose our minds and do crazy things.  This is a stunning writing achievement.

It's obviously out but no stupid release date?  If you can't wait then you can buy it on eBay from the UK but it's pricy.   I want to watch this dvd before season 4 comes out.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|love it. the birds go boom. and I go ha ha. makes up for boring work. u showed download this app. definitely worth it . just don't become addicted to this game like I have.
B004A8ZWTW|5.0|It was so good, I went to see it twice in one day. Mia Wasikowska, who played Jane Eyre, and Michael Fassbender, Mr. Rochester, were perfect. I believed their love and suffering. I used to think that no one can do better Rochester than Timothy Dalton, but after seeing this adaptation, Fassbender took that spot. In other adaptations Mr. Rochester overshadowed Jane, but in this film Jane and Rochester are equal. I loved that dialogue follows the book pretty closely and it was not too modernized. Judi Dench was great as Mrs. Fairfax, and Jamie Bell was believable as cold St.John Rivers. Of course the scenery and costumes were gorgeous. For a 2 hr film director Cary Fukunaga did wonders. Highly recommended! Now I can't wait for the DVD to come out (hopefully with special features and deleted scenes).  p.s. I forgot to mention that the music score is lovely and fits the mood perfectly.

0756404738|3.0|First like most people who have written reviews I loved the first book and could not wait until the second book was released. After I finished the first book I thought book 2 would wrap up Kvothe's story and book 3 would be about present day events. But after reading book 2 I just cannot see that happening. I can sum up all of book two in one sentence. Kvothe learned to fight and learned to screw like a rabbit.... I hate to be blunt but really that is all you really get from TWMF. I waited three weeks to write this review because I didn't want to review it right after I finished. I wanted to wait and let it simmer and see how I felt. The disappointment I felt after I finished hasn't faded.      (spoiler/rant)  I expected so much more, I mean you learn NOTHING absolutely nothing new about the Chandrin. How do you write 1000 pages and not advance a single plot point, that in and of itself has to be some kind of record. The book starts at the University and ends at the University. No character development, you learn nothing new about Dena, nothing about Auri though there are some strong hints that she knows a lot about the Amir.  You still don't know where the door in the Archives leads. You don't learn how he gets expelled from the university. Even the events that transpire in the book are kind of lame. In the first book you believe Kvothe is a master swordsmen only to learn that he spends 3 months with the Adem then leaves.... How much of a master can you be after 3 months. Even the Fulurian story line doesn't sync up. The first book again hints that he learned magic during his time with Fulurian but that isn't true he learns nothing.... well not nothing.... I imagine that 1000 fingers thing would be pretty useful with the ladies.    I am sure this can all be explained by Pat's grand scheme of turning the traditional epic fantasy tropes on there head. That the stories you hear about hero characters are always exaggerated. I think that is great but you don't need 1000pages to do it. A book without character development or a climax is not a book.... it is a diary....  (End spoiler/rant)    With that said it is not all bad. Pat is a very gifted writer and even though there is no plot advancement or even a climax I still found it enjoyable to read.  Book 3 I am guessing is going to be a climax avalanche. I can't see a way that Pat can wrap up Kvothe's past and then go into present day events without it being 2000 pages long. Which means we will have no idea if he ever gets out of his depression funk and how current events unfold or things are going to end so rapidly that we won't get to enjoy Pats masterful story telling. I think Pat has written himself into a corner and it will be a long long time before we see the final book.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Installed Amazon App Store to a HTC Droid Incredible rooted with Virtuous 3.2 rom    Works fine, the game plays very well with very minor hiccups.  Great improvement to graphics!    Kind of sucks that you NEED the App store to run it. Hopefully it shouldn't cause any problems.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Final Fantasy VII - As awesome as ever.    This is very aptly named. COMPLETE. It really completes the story, the extra scenes added help to round out the story and characters well; it's not wasted on useless action scenes (even though action scenes are awesome, they mean nothing without back story).     I really recommend you get this!!! I can't stress that enough.
B004QYZATW|4.0|I enjoyed it better than Salt. It was kind of funny at times, stylish. Not a big screen movie but I did enjoyed the story, specially because I was expecting it to be worst, the chemistry was fine.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Within reason, this application will find anything you want. it's not going to find an Indie band's b side or anything, but it really helps, especially if you just keep hearing this catchy song over and over again. Friday, Friday...
B003YWUTJI|4.0|An interesting concept to compile many songs that Norah Jones worked on with other artists from the past decade. Most of the songs work here such as \\"Bull Rider\\", \\"The Best Part\\", \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\", \\"Take Off Your Cool\\", \\"Life Is Better\\", \\"Soon The New Day\\", \\"Dear John\\", \\"Creepin' In\\", \\"Court & Spark\\", \\"More Than This\\" and \\"Blue Bayou\\".<br /><br />At 18 tracks, it is a bit daunting and overlong, but the songs are good enough that the time flies right by. The only complaint that keeps this from being a four star outing is that the tempo of most of the tracks is either mid-tempo to slow. There are no rockers here. On the same token, another minus is that Norah Jones doesn't really adapt to different genres of music but instead re-creates what she already does on her own albums. I don't necessarily think that is a sign of a great artist. She is talented, but if you listen to her four albums there are only minor changes musically.<br /><br />Still, \\"...featuring Norah Jones\\" is worth a listen.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|The first time in years that I've had songs stuck in my head for days... this album. I see the main review often compares this song to Demon Days... well, same band, but this is a completely different monster and must not be compared to an album that was made 5 years ago. My life is different, my mood is different, and the world in itself is different than it was 5 years ago, and this album should not be compared to a masterpiece of 2005.    That said, all I can say is this album is worth getting. It beautifully paints the landscape of the lives we experience in the free world... so beautiful in some ways, and dreadfully melancholy and borderline sickening on the other end of the spectrum. It sounds and feels like a massive, internal yearning to get out of this \\"plastic beach\\" we are sitting on. So beautiful by looks, but so stupidly fragile the way it was built.    Anyway, awesome album. Listen to it through once or twice, then do it again in a couple weeks. As for me, I waited 3 months after that second listen... life changed, and so did my perception with this album. It has grown on me and I am infected with its sounds. Don't wait!     Also, check out the Stylo video on youtube with Bruce Willis.
0756404738|5.0|I couldn' wait for this book to get released! I read the first one, The Name of The Wind, twice and it was great both times. The Wise Man's Fear, so far, is as intriguing.

B002VPE1XE|4.0|I was a little leery about this item due to the price. However, after a week at Universal Studios Florida, I'm a believer.<br /><br />  My primary concern was the amount of velcro and lack of zippers. The velcro is actually very strong. I wore it attached to my belt 90% of the trip and on every ride including the Incredible Hulk, The Dudly DooRight sawmill ride, the Jurassic Park River ride and all the Harry Potter rides.<br /><br />  My second concern was how water-proof this case would be. Before I go into detail, I would like to point out that this case does not claim to be water proof or even resistant. Just to be on the safe side, I put the camera in a zip-lock baggy when I went on the water rides. After every ride, I checked the inside of the case and sure enough, bone dry. Further proof of its... Let's say \\"water resistance\\" is as follows. Around day 4 we were on the far end of the park in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Seemingly out of nowhere it started to downpour, of the torrential variety. We walked, through the onslaught of rain from WWoHP to the Universal parking gareage (that's a hike), camera case firmly attached to my belt with nothing but the bottom of my cotton shirt over it. By the time we got to the car we looked, and felt, like we just climbed out of a swimming pool. I barely believed it myself, but the inside of the case was barely damp.<br /><br />  The only complaint that I really have is that there is a little gap between the flap and the case, which is why I still kept the camera in a baggy during the water rides even when it had been tested several times and come out dry. Other than that it's a solid case. The little zipper compartment is great for holding spare batteries, SD cards and drivers license/credit cards etc. For just under 9 bucks, you really can't beat this case.

B003Y74AXO|5.0|So I have an IPad, and love it. I didn't think I would use it much now I can't live without it. Being that it IS like a giant ITouch/IPhone one wants to protect it as much as you can. We all have gotten those little plastic covers for those and now it's time to get on for the IPad. As coverings go this one is pretty run of the mill. The plastic is a nice thickness and gives just the slightest bit of texture to the surface of the screen, which is nice because just that teeny bit of drag helps. As for the anti-glare part...eh...I don't notice much difference. I wasn't really looking for anti-glare when I got it so I'm disappointed in it.  It works great and for the price it can't be beat.
0393338827|5.0|The Big Short by Michael Lewis was very well written. His style and delivery are fantastic and I couldn't stop reading the book. I also ended up researching several of the characters he wrote about. I put the book down with a lot more insight into how ridiculous this scam (don't know the best word to describe it) was. I plan to read more from Lewis as I really enjoyed his style.

B00002Z88D|5.0|It's amazing how great Metallica goes with the symphony. This features the greatest performance ever of The Call Of Ktulu. Nothing Else Matters has never sounded better, and the two new songs, No Leaf Clover and - Human are great! There are some obvious omissions that should have been played. The Unforgiven, Fade To Black, & Welcome Home (Sanitarium)would have been perfect candidates. In fact, The Unforgiven was planned to be played, but the boys didn't like the orchestral arrangement. It also contains a nice booklet featuring a bunch of photos from the two gigs, as this is a combination of two shows at the Berkely. A great buy, and the best symphony meets rock/metal album I've ever heard. R.I.P Michael Kamen
B00479SVBU|5.0|An FM transmitter's first job is to transmit a clear, consistent signal to your car's radio.  This product does this better than any other product I have tried.  I live in a city with cluttered airwaves and my signal never (ever) waivers.  It is clear and consistent.  In fact, it sounds as good as radio stations with the strongest signals in my market.  If you plan on plugging in an existing music player (iPod, zune, etc), look no further.  This is as good as it gets.  This product also provides the ability play music from media (SD card or USB flash drive).  I give this functionality only 4 stars, as folder navigation is a little primitive and music does not always play in order.  I have not yet figured out the patten or rationale behind this (and no, it is not on shuffle).  However, I stick with my 5-star rating because it rocks at its primary purpose.  By the way, shipping was quick and service excellent.

B0040T7B2W|3.0|I'm a huge Belle & Sebastian fan so I wish I had something better to say about this album. After six years away from recording, you think Stuart Murdoch and the rest of the band would come up with something a little bit better and less phoned-in. Write About Love is a huge disappointment with nary a standout or memorable track among the bunch. Even Belle & Sebastian's previous worst album, Fold Your Hands Child You Walk Like A Peasant, gave us the masterpiece The Model. I also can't believe that a Stevie song, I'm Not Living In The Real World, is my favorite track on this new CD.

B000EUDAWG|3.0|Had the desired scary effect on office arachnophobes. It needs a smooth surface as its (hidden underneath) wheels are very smnall. Wooden flow, desktop or table is fine. On carpet it sticks but keeps waving the legs. Did move slowly on tight loop office carpet if there were no slight undulations. Easy to control and with aerial slipped up one's sleep the remote fits snugly in the palm so the fact that you are the controller is not obvious.

B00006HAZG|5.0|This story is such a classic that anyone must know it without having ever read it, just like me. Peggotty has been an old friend of mine since junior high school but never had I opened the book, though I have the complete works of Charles Dickens in my library, and never had I seen any screen adaptation of it before tonight. So I just discovered this fine story in my old age, and in a way I regret it.<br /><br />Of course there are orphans and in this case even, David Copperfield is orphaned before his birth. Of course there are step parents who are absolutely obnoxious and brutal. Of course there is a school for boys who are treated like dogs and beaten like trash. Of course there are strict and painful social situations that lead to prison, begging, being robbed and whatever you can imagine, especially when you are a nice young boy, too pure to be true and too naïve to be serious.<br /><br />But even the factory in which David Copperfield is forced to work at the early age of ten or eleven looks like paradise when compared with the stepfather and his dear sister, two goal-keepers and nothing else. And that's the miracle of Dickens. He transforms an absolutely bleak situation into a rose garden, or if you prefer the crazy crushing life of a boy into a school for gentility and success.<br /><br />That's the mystery and miracle Dickens cultivates in all his books. No matter how horrible life may be, and be sure he remained discreet about the worst details, he turns it into a happy ending and a success story. And that's how a forlorn and abandoned orphan will be able to cut a position for himself under the sun and in society.<br /><br />People could say Dickens was a blind optimist, but he was not blind at all and knew about the sinister life we live in. We could say he is a hypocrite writing stories about the dregs of society to sell them to and make money from the rich and wealthy minority that could read and afford the serials or books, and what's more to cover up with happy endings the terrible fate of most working people and children in this Victorian society. And we would be wrong.<br /><br />Dickens' books are a testimony of what Victorian society was and a great lesson given to those who had and still have the power and the money necessary to change things that change cannot be stopped because there will always be a few who will be strong enough or lucky enough to climb up to a position from which they may influence the world. In fact he thinks he is one of these and he is telling us book after book the same story of the enterprising young man who will change the world with his words and mind.<br /><br />It is optimistic for sure but heart warming even more, and this BBC adaptation is just perfect as for that brittle equilibrium between social criticism and human advancement.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULAREDEAUle fate of most working people and children in this Victorian society.

1596680296|5.0|I love this book. I have not been knitting long, but wanted to try to knit socks.  I tried different patterns and books but could only get so far and then couldn't understand what was being said to finish the project with even going to on line videos to help learn some techniques.  I read the reviews on this book and decided to try it and I'm so glad I did.  My first attempt didn't look so great, but I was so proud because I was actually able to follow the written instructions and pictures to complete it.  It actually shows what should be on needle 1, 2 and 3.  I have since made a few socks and they look great.  I also like how they show a basic sock pattern for each weight yarn from super fine to bulky.  This is a definate buy for someone wanting to learn how to knit socks.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|For anyone who enjoys a nice popcorn-eating action movie in the theaters, I would recommend this. It was far from War of the Worlds in terms of acting, entertainment, story, etc; but it's definitely worth watching if you're like me and those alien invasion-type movies entertain you. Without spoiling the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, I must say that it seemed very \\"empty\\" by the ending, and seemed to have left out a lot of other key subjects in the movie. That's why it's not a 4-star or 5-star movie in my option. I'd rate it 3.5 stars if I could though, as I enjoyed it, but have definitely seen better movies.    But I must say, that this movie deserves a lot better of critic reviews from Rottentomatoes. It really isn't as bad as some critics perceive it to be.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|pretty amazing
B004SBX112|5.0|Angry birds seasons is a huge improvement over the original game which I've spent countless hours on trying to smash those darn pigs. With more levels, decoratively themed according to the season/holiday, they bring you more levels to play, and more golden eggs to discover.<br /><br />Angry Birds Seasons is not for the beginner player though, it's best to start off with the original game and become accustomed to the gameplay and strategic puzzle solving required to smash the pigs. This is probably a con, but can also be seen as a pro. If they were too easy, for a experience player like myself, I'd just run through all the levels in a matter of minutes. This makes the challenge and constant retrying add to the satisfaction of when you finally killed the last pig on the level.<br /><br />Each level is creatively decorated, such as the valentines day pack, there may be clouds or ice blocks shaped like hearts, and the pigs have little cupid wings with bow and arrows too. For christmas, there could be presents hidden around that'll give you extra points if smashed!<br /><br />Great app, and a great game. I'll continue to support Rovio and keep playing each angry birds game they create, it may be repetitive killing pigs all day long, but they did something right to make me keep coming back wanting more.

006145205X|5.0|Every now and again a book comes out that deserves to be read and discussed by your entire campus (or organization). Nudge and The Wisdom of Crowds are two such books. For this summer, I'm going to recommend The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, by Matt Ridley.    I can't think of a more fundamental set of questions than:    -- \\"Will the future be better or worse than the past?\\"    -- \\"How do our material lives differ from our grandparents, their grandparents, and their grandparents?\\"    -- \\"What have been the large causes and forces behind economic growth, why is wealth so unevenly distributed, and what can we do to insure more wealth for everyone in the future?\\"    Ridely tackles all of these big questions with answers and stories grounded in history, economics, and sociology. Since he specializes in none of these disciplines, (he is a zoologist by training and journalist, author and failed banker by experience), he is able to write about all of them in ways that non-specialists and non-insiders can understand and enjoy.    The Rational Optimist would be great to read and discuss on campus because the book:    -- Makes an argument that the world has gotten and will get much better, that provides plenty of room for informed debates and disagreements.    -- Backs up the arguments with history and facts, in the process educating and edifying those who will both agree and disagree with his conclusions.    -- Is written from a viewpoint that seems to be to the right of the average academic's (or at least my own) political orientation. For instance, Ridely is extremely skeptical about global warming, and even more convinced that government is more often a hindrance to social and economic progress rather than a catalyst. We all need to be open to arguments from people whose politics differ from our own.    I also think that this book would be good for students, faculty, and staff to read and discuss because its main thesis, that the world that our students and our children will inherit will be materially better in almost every conceivable way, runs directly counter to most of what our students absorb in the classroom and through the media. We want our students to be rationally optimistic, and we want them to have the abilities and knowledge to make up their own minds about the degree to which they agree or disagree with Ridley's conclusions.    Learning technologists, I believe, are predisposed to be sympathetic with the arguments presented in The Rational Optimist, as our business is all about creating a better (educational) future.    We believe:    -- That technology can help the seminar student transition from a consumer of knowledge to a producer.    -- That technology can help bring the benefits of the individualized and personalized learning that is inherent to the seminar experience to the format of a large lecture class.    -- That technology, through the Web, can help diffuse the sharing and synthesis of knowledge of the lecture format to the larger community of life-long learners.    -- That technology will allow learners who were once cut off from higher education, due to geographic or time or work or family commitments and constraints, to participate in higher education and receive their degrees through online learning.    In short, we are optimistic that technology will be one of the levers we use to both improve higher education and to scale these benefits to more people. We are convinced that technology is an essential and important ingredient in the improvement of higher education, that today's colleges are better than yesterday's, and that tomorrow's learners will be better off than today's.    Are you as optimistic about the future of higher education, and the world in general, as I am? What book would you nominate to be read and discussed this summer by everyone on your campus?

If you have ever had to do a project with MS Project, or solely by e-mail and spreadsheets, than you will appreciate the simplicity, elegance, and flexibility of Basecamp.    The founders of 37Signals developed Basecamp to manage their own internal projects, only then realizing they had a service on their hands that other small teams would find useful. Basecamp requires no support from your central IT organization, no local hardware, and no expertise in project management. You can be up and running with a free 30 day trial in 60 seconds. Plans start at $24 a month.    Basecamp is not just a product but also a philosophy. Less features well done are better than many features that complicate a product. Offer services that are lightweight and agile, and resist the urge to meet the needs of every customer. Let your customer outgrow your product. Basecamp is the physical (or digital?) manifestation of the philosophy of work that 37Signals is selling in Rework. The company prides itself on keeping operations lean, costs down, working arrangements flexible, and paid marketing to a minimum. If you work for 37Signals you don't attend many meetings, don't write many strategic plans, and don't give many internal presentations. You are expected and encouraged to carve out quiet time for productive work, to share your work product early and often, and to be open to criticism. What you are not expected to do is work insane hours, sacrifice family or sleep time, or set unrealistic deadlines or goals.    It could be that 37Signals got lucky with Basecamp, and are falling into thefallacy of assuming that their work culture is an optimal culture because it produced Basecamp. The other products from 37Signals, Highrise (contact tracking), Backpack (Intranet), and Campfire (code sharing) have not enjoyed nearly the same level of success as Basecamp. We know from Leonard Mlodinow's book, The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives, that we all under-estimate the role of chance in our successes and failures. Nor is the advice in Rework particularly original. Experts like James O'Toole have long been recommending more flexible and less hierarchal workplaces.    What is different about Rework is that the founders of 37Signals are pitching their ideas at a level that can work with small teams on the sorts of projects and tasks that we all do. Anyone in charge of rolling out and supporting new learning technology services will benefit from reading Rework. You don't need a top-down re-org or permission from your leadership to make our products and team interactions more like those of 37Signals. We are all in some measure complacent in meeting cultures , reliances on committees, and the putting off of \\"shipping\\" new services until that mythical time the platform meets everyone's needs.    Rework should provoke a good discussion of how your team does things differently from how the team at 37Signals approaches tasks. In the end you may not decide to adopt all of the recommendations in Rework, but I guarantee that this book cause you to take a hard look at how your group operates.    Any Basecamp users want to jump in on the service? What do you think about the idea of writing a short book like Rework that spells out your work culture philosophy and the thinking behind the services you offer?

0374290024|5.0|First published on my blog on 3/6/11:  [...]  Yes.    Ian Morris' Why the West Rules--for Now: The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future is perhaps the best argument for why we should keep investing in training PhDs and allocating resources to our institutions of higher learning.    Morris is a Stanford professor, a Cambridge University PhD, and the author of 10 books and \\"more than 80 articles on archaeology and history.\\" He is a guy who gets his hands dirty, leading digs in places like Monte Polizzo, Sicily - as well as a gifted writer.    Should you invest the 24 hours and 41 minutes necessary to listen to this book?    Yes if you often wonder \\"how did I get here,\\" in the sense of owning all this crap, burning all this fuel etc. etc., while most of the world (at least the vast numbers of rural poor in Asia), today live quite different lives.''    Yes if you've ever argued out loud (or thought to yourself), that the reason we Westerners have so much crap and burn so much fuel was either an inevitable development due to geography, climate, species, disease patterns etc. (long-term lock-in), or the result of actions and decisions by both great and incompetent historical actors (short-term accident).''    Yes if you wonder why social development in the Eastern world (as measured by energy capture, information exchange, war making capacity, and city size) outstripped the Western world from the 1,000 years between 600 CE and 1600 CE, only to fall radically behind the West by 2000.''    Yes if you think it is important to take the really long view, from the beginning of agriculture (8,000 to 5,000 BCE), rather than starting the story at the beginning of the industrial revolution in late 18th century England.''    Yes if you have the sense that real story of the 21st century will happen in Asia, and that if we want to be working where the big changes in higher ed will be occurring we better be prepared to work in East or South Asia.''Yes if you lovehistory, sociology, archeology, and economics - and like books that integrate theories, ideas and facts from across the disciplines.''    Yes if you want to escape, if only for a few hours, the world of fast changing technology (where my 6 month old iPad is already out-of-date), and place your brain inside much larger time scales thinking about much bigger questions.''    What are you reading?
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I have a close friend who had a stroke.  I knew nothing about strokes, and one of his relatives recommended this book. It was very  insightful, talking about the physical process in a way you can understand, and about what is going on in someone's head when they have a stroke. It is so frustrating for the person not to be able to communicate normally and this really helped me to understand his frustration and learn to communicate better with my friend.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Have been using Shazam for quite some time now ...on both my galaxy tab and iphone.  This app has come in handy SO many times!  I hear a song on the radio that I like...shazam it, and download it later!  Almost always gets the song I'm inquiring about!!  Heck, I paid $5 for the iphone version....well worth it....thanks Amazon for another great free daily app!!!
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I won't review the movie here, but to summarize, it's a great rendition of the story (though not faithful enough for some).  My complaint is with the format of the DVD. The widescreen version (16:9) should include more visual information than the fullscreen version (4:3). This DVD has less. Why?   Movies are shot at a wide aspect ratio because movie theatres have screens that are quite a bit wider than conventional TV screens, relative to their height. That's why, when you buy a fullscreen version of a movie on DVD, you'll find that the right and left edges have been cut off. And that's why they have a note at the beginning that says \\"This presentation has been modified from the original, it has been reformatted to fit your screen\\".  Guess what? The widescreen version of this DVD actually cuts off the top and bottom of the fullscreen version to make it fit a wider screen again!? What? Instead of going back to the original widescreen version they actually cut off more of the the (already cut off) regular TV version. What a disappointment...  So, if you want to see as much of the fabulous original cinematography, get the fullscreen version. I can only hope the Blu-Ray version goes back to the original format.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|Been a long time since we went to the theater to see these shows.  I purchased both sets for my Granddaughter and I'm surprised how well they have stood the test of time.  True, some of the effects we were bowled over by in my day are a bit ho hum now.  But, the story and the action still captured my Grandkids.  Thanks.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Good App for the price. Great addition to the original Angry Birds and Seasons. Just seems a little laggy when running on my Samsung Fascinate, but that could be because of Apps running in the background. You can get it free if you have the Amazon AppStore. Don't worry about having to be logged in Amazon to play the game because you have to be logged in to Google just to access the Android Market.<br /><br />@ lau² \\"lala\\" stop being negative about the Amazon AppStore. Having to be logged is common in iTunes, XBox Live, PSN, and most other online software providing stores.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Good thing it's free because all it does is take up space. Says &quot;setup could not be completed at this time&quot; when I run it and won't go any further. Tried reinstalling it, tried rebooting phone, tried on 3G and wifi. Waste of time.
0439023521|2.0|The Hunger Games was well written and certainly grabbed your attention, a Page Turner! BUT, the subject matter, killing another person, simply was not suitable for my 12 year old granddaughter.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Even better than the original version and seasons. The graphics are great! It works perfectly on my Droid. I love the new characters. please review the game, not the app store.
159420229X|4.0|It was a very fun read into the lives of professional mental athletes.  The mental athletes are people who compete at national and international competitions of memory.  The competition includes memorizing numbers, playing cards, names and faces, poetry, and some other odds and ends.<br />  The book will give you an idea of how these athletes learn to memorize information, but it goes as far as saying.  They use a memory palace in which you must visualize crazy, unique, and/or lewd images to ingrain the information in your brain. But beyond these shallow summaries, you will not (as the author states) learn any memory techniques.<br /><br />There are many books that will tell you how to memorize information through the techniques referred to in this book.  But this book will not teach you the techniques.<br /><br />The book is a fun look at the world of mental athletes, the question of how useful the techniques are in real life, and the study of memory in unique humans that CAN memorize everything they see.<br /><br />Very entertaining book.  It is basically a documentary.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|This Cd is Awesome. Jennifer is topnotch to me. Her vocal are hers and computer generated. And she sounds the same in live settings. My faves are Gone, Where you at?, Believe(love love how she made this Country hit hers too), Still Here, Don't look down. Wasn't really feeling Angel though. Great job Jennifer I am blasting Gone as we speak.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|When I heard that Warner Brother's was postponing this movie's release I was upset for at least a week. However, now that I have seen it I realize that it was well worth the wait. This is the most amazing book-to-movie ever made. It's even better since it comes from a true masterpiece by JK Rowling and the fact that the director and producers stayed so true to the books originality made me sing with joy. This is a classic and you will not regret watching it at all. It has drama, action, romance and a lot of comic relief. Seriously, this is the most fantastic movie and I applaud every person who helped to create it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I love to read fantasy novels.  Grew up reading Tolkien, have been reading the Wheel of Time for the last 20 years, bit by agonizing bit.  The Wise Man's Fear books include all the great aspects of fantasy, and the most compelling story I have EVER read.  The characters are excellant, and the story telling is the best ever.  Very sad I will have to wait for the next book.  I hope it comes soon.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Damn Sucker Punch was EPIC! So ZEN!     Too bad 99% of ppl \\"will be unprepared\\" to understand the overly simple, perhaps too RAW (lol), yet profound message of the film:     It's NOT about the story making sense! It's about YOU making sense of the story... not Baby Doll's story, not Sweet Pea's story, but YOUR story!     99% of people prefer to be TOLD why something makes sense, rather than stepping up and making sense out of something for themselves.     So in honoring the message of the film, I'll \\"step up\\" and \\"make sense\\" of the film's story for the many who have seen it but still complain that it was the DIRECTOR'S responsibility to provide \\"clarity\\" for the audience despite critics complaining at the same time that the dialogue was \\"not complex enough\\"      In a nut shell, a girl \\"loses everything\\" (her mom, her sister, her sanity) essentially becoming \\"an orphan\\" and is thrown into a chaotic world that doesn't make sense (note: it MADE sense BEFORE she \\"lost everything\\")     NOW she is trapped in this prison called \\"reality\\" populated only by \\"whores\\" and their \\"masters\\".     The \\"whores\\" do what their masters tell them because they are not \\"free\\" to do otherwise, and in fact rationalize that their masters are allowing them to \\"be who they are\\" so it's all good.     However the orphan girl \\"Baby Doll\\" decides to be \\"selfish\\" and say being \\"allowed to exist\\" by the masters of the their world \\"isn't good enough\\" and that \\"survival is not enough\\" and that it is only really worth it if you are truly \\"free\\" on your own terms.     She recruits others to their cause and the very fact that they join says that despite the \\"fear\\" they feel of leaving \\"everything they know and have\\" behind, a tiny part of them agrees that being \\"truly free\\" (ie their own masters) is more selfishly desirable than the illusion of \\"being who they are\\" when it is the ONLY option dictated to them by their masters.     Over the course of their plan to become free not everyone \\"survives\\" but then again everyone is destined to die anyway (yeah nobody wants to hear that but it IS true hate to break the bad news =P) and in the end all that was really accomplished was turning a team of \\"whores\\" INTO \\"masters\\" of their own story...    So basically yeah, a long selfless life as a whore, or a short SELFISH life as a master is basically what their story boils down to =D    But the irony is that this simple example is the same choice everyone needs to make with their lives but these are EXTREME examples     (Hello, it's a movie! extreme examples are the only way to get your attention! 99% of people are BORING examples)     Yes ideally you want to life a LONG SELFISH LIFE (like The Matrix, like Inception, like Avatar where you get to be selfish AND have a \\"happy ending\\")     But since 99% of people are not being selfish enough in their REAL LIVES after watching these so called \\"inspirational life changing reality mind-opening outside the box idea\\" movies, Sucker Punch decides to \\"fast-forward\\" from the \\"happy ending\\" moment that the former three movies leave you at and go all the way until Baby's apparent \\"death\\"     Many people see this as a \\"letdown\\" because she \\"died\\" almost like she was \\"punished\\" by death for being \\"too selfish\\" and that despite how hard she tried, it was all for nothing and she ended up \\"a failure\\" unlike Neo, Cobb, and Sully who selfishly went against all odds to be \\"truly free\\" and \\"won\\" a \\"happy ending\\"    These people are TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT: Neo, Cobb, and Sully all die too, their deaths are just never shown.     Baby's IS shown, and the point is that it's not about the happy ending but about the happy JOURNEY.     \\"The end\\" is 100% certain but \\"the journey\\" is YOUR choice! And that choice is \\"happy journey\\" or \\"sad journey\\", end be damned!     Baby KNEW she was going to die, in fact she KNEW before her journey even started! (Proof: she was just seconds away from getting lobotomized before her journey began =P)     In the some ofthe final scenes of the movie, Baby realizes her time is up, it's not longer her story but Sweet Pea's now (and ultimately the viewer's story after passing on that message)     Baby may not have reached the \\"goal\\" of her \\"physical\\" journey to \\"escape the prison and gain freedom\\" but in a ZEN sense, the self-chosen journey itself WAS the freedom she sought, it WAS the reward, as the map, fire, knife, and key were just breadcrumb \\"goals\\" leading her to the ultimate realization of the final goal: \\"self\\" is what sets you free.     Also in the final moments where the doc says \\"look at her face, it's almost like she WANTED this\\" and the former \\"master\\" being dragged off for being \\"mentally insane\\" can basically be interpreted in the extreme sense that she made the CHOICE to live by the standards of her own inner world rather than by what her external world told her     (Nobody WANTS death, but PHYSICAL death is INEVITABLE, so the only thing you really have a true choice of freewill over is SPIRITUAL death or spiritual LIFE and she \\"physically\\" died making the SPIRITUAL choice she WANTED =P)     Then the former \\"master\\" gets dragged away \\"defeated\\" as he has \\"failed\\" to get her to submit to \\"spiritual death\\" and is exposed to the audience as being the true \\"insane\\" one.     Also for further clarity, once Baby realized \\"self = freedom\\" her journey was complete as she was \\"seconds away from physical death\\" and \\"out of time\\" so it was no longer \\"her story\\" and now Sweet Pea's and ultimately the viewer's story.     Scenes of Sweet Pea getting on the bus with a \\"long journey\\" ahead of her accompanied by Baby's wisdom \\"the wise man\\" she has \\"all the tools\\" she needs to fight / write her own story / live the journey as her own master and not as somebody else' whore etc.     THAT is ultimately the message the movie was intended to deliver, but instead of simply saying it this complexly, the Director expects YOU to DO WORK and THINK about it to make your own CHOICES about what themessage actually was...     If they TOLD you what \\"it\\" was like every other movie out there, it wouldn't have the same effect of YOU making sense of things YOURSELF     So essentially anyone who complains about the \\"ending\\" is just \\"unprepared\\" to think for themselves because they cling to the mantra that movies should TELL rather than EXPRESS and let the viewer make the DECISION on how to interpret life    (Maybe it's just saying that all the people who didn't understand the movie are to some degree still \\"whores\\" and have yet to truly become masters of their own stories and that if a rebel orphan comes along and tries to recruit you on a \\"suicide\\" mission where you'll \\"get what you truly desire\\" by \\"giving up everything you currently hold dear\\" then you should just ignore her and stay in \\"blissful ignorance\\" of the \\"illusion that you are free\\" until the day you die... just kidding....... kinda ;)    OR maybe I was just \\"lucky\\" to read the multiple \\"grade F\\" reviews by the majority of so called \\"professional\\" movie critics allowing me to completely disregard the hype, go into the theater EXPECTING complete crap, and yet walk away from the experience with an unbiased pure, personal interpretation of the EXPRESSION that is Sucker Punch haha...    But yeah, subtle & simple yet profound & \\"zen\\" meaning of life message and ending aside, the \\"journey\\" of the movie was MORE than enjoyable with EPIC comicbook/scifi/fantasy inspired eye-candy visuals, great music, and a harem of hotties including blondes, asian, and VANESSA HUDGENS! ...what's NOT to like? <3    Oh... and for the retards who complain \\"but we never got to SEE the actual dance\\" ...the \\"Fantasy/action/dream sequence\\" IS the DANCE effin retards ...it's called a METAPHOR!    \\"Dance\\" is on a fundamental level simply just \\"expressing\\" your \\"inner world\\" to anyone who wants to see it.     Dancers don't TELL, they EXPRESS so therefore the viewer isn't TOLD anything, he/she can only INTERPRET the dancer's self expression based on his/her own DECISIONS.     Dancers are Performing ARTISTS so in a sense the entire movie isn't really a story TELLING you what it IS, it's just ART, the whole film is a DANCE for the audience to interpret and decide what to make of it on their own, because hey \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\"     Sucker Punch is ART in the purist sense of the word. Film ORIGINATED as an ART (not as storytelling like writing) something which most movies and viewers tend to forget =)
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Heard of Bruno Mars but not his music until I heard his songs on Youtube from some other singers.  Great album w/ excellent music especially \\"Just The Way You Are\\".  Enjoying his music more and more everytime I listen to it.  Get this album if you like R&B, abit of pop and nice ballads w/ abit of hip hop.  Also his song \\"Nothing On You\\" from the Grammys 2011 CD is excellent; even better than most of the songs on this album
B001CZVVV4|5.0|[[ASIN:B000Y9M09G Bellini: I Puritani]]  I liked this production since the first time that I saw it on PBS, even though it took a while to buy it.  I found the cast very good mainly the principal characters:   Elvira played by Anna Netrebko was very convincing, her transformation when She thought that her fiancé was running away with somebody else and performance the \\"mad scene\\" singing and effortless acting when she dropped to the floor in a frenzy attack continuing singing , at the end she showed her happiness when he returned and married her.   Eric Cutler played Elvira's fiancé very well done having a wonderful voice for this role.  John Relyea who I have seen playing other characters in other operas was very good in this role showing his love and concern for her sister.  The scenery, choreography and costumes were very successful, as well as the orchestra and direction were outstanding.  This is a beautiful performance and the quality of this DVD is great, in my opinion deserves 5 stars.
B001UJJJ9I|5.0|I love Puccini, but have never really been a big fan of this opera. It is considered one the best by most Puccini fans, but it has always left me a bit cold. That is, until this recording. It's so well produced and sung that I can say I have to say my feelings about the opera may be warming up my feelings towards the work. Both leads sing extremely well and convincingly. I almost believe the story could actually happen when I listen to this (even though the story is absurd which is partly why I never really liked it much). Do yourself a favor and get this recording. It's a true wonder.
030746363X|5.0|I had my own \\"Harajuku moment\\" after reaching an all-time low in health and motivation. A new gym membership was all that got me until I read several chapters of this book. In 3 months I have accomplished almost exactly what was outlined, had my best season of mogul skiing in my life (46 yrs old, but the snow was great...) and feel much healthier and stronger. The key was that Ferris put together a plan I could adhere to and make sense of, and yes, it only takes about 30 mins and every 3rd day. My wife unfortunately isn't ready to handle the other chapters so I can't comment on that. You can doubt it, but it worked phenomenally for me, and the rest is a fun read.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|As horror films go, this adaptation of a Swedish film is a memorable one, and not for the reasons you might expect.  Of course there's blood - it's a vampire movie, after all.  But it's primarily a first-love story about the friendship between a pre-teen boy and girl - it's just that she turns out to be a vampire. It's a moody piece: Young Owen is a lonely, bullied boy who meets Abby, his new next-door neighbor who has moved in one evening with her adult companion - who is not her father, it turns out, and does her bidding by helping find her victims. The two young actors who play them are excellent: Kodi-Smit McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz already have some serious film cred, having appeared in \\"The Road\\" and \\"Kick-Ass\\", respectively.  Richard Jenkins, who was nominated for an Oscar for \\"The Visitor\\", seems to be making a career of playing world-weary characters, and he is excellent too, as always. I'm not the biggest fan of graphic horror, but this well-acted and touching love story carried me through and made even the most violent scenes easier to take, in a strange, gothic way.  This will probably be remembered as one of the best films of the genre, and rightly so.
B004SKHJF2|2.0|2 stars for a nice look and feel to this app.  however, after the first successful match, all subsequent attempts are met with an *immediate* yes/no dialog bow explaining that the song can not be matched before the app even tries to listen.   this persists until the phone is rebooted.   have tried re-installing with same outcome

0060775858|5.0|The first time I read this book to my child, I got it out at the library. I thought it was silly and didn't make a lot of sense to me.  The book stayed on my mind for weeks after though, and grew on me.  I think it creates a comforting enviroment for the child and it is a great book to read to them before bedtime.  What I would like to know is why is the \\"quiet old lady\\" not called \\"Grandmother\\" to the rabbit who is ready to go to sleep?  I wonder if this \\"old lady\\" adopted the child, and where are the child's parents?  This made me feel like the rabbit was lucky to have such a nice \\"old lady\\" to take care of him and knit by his bedside.  Why was the bowl of mush uneaten, and isn't mush for breakfast?  It is also funny how the kittens take not notice of the mouse in the same room as them.  There are small,hidden, interesting things in this book, the answers to these questions we will probably never know. I gave this book five stars because it gives the reader a lot to think about, like those questions above, and especially because the book creates that great before bedtime setting.  All of Margaret Wise Brown's books seem to create an aura of comfort, and they are timeless classics.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I use this mic with my Ham radio where it is essential to have a nice clean, crisp, articulate mic when transmitting all over the world via the airways where one is dealing with snaps, crackles and pops as well as other interferences.  This mic is very crisp and true sounding and has a good punch in the range that is needed most.  The low roll-off and broad ranged flat frequency response gives a nice clean, clear true audio. On paper the spec's rival more expensive mic's costing 5-8 times as much.  In terms of use with music it will produce true sound from vocal or instrument with no masking or muffled or otherwise distorted audio.  It is a plus, plus, plus all win situation and at a bargain price that I dare to say no other mic can give you the performance and quality at this bargain price.  You would have to spend 4-5 times as much just to start to challenge this mic and to be in the same ball-park.    You can hear the comparison of a $100 mic against this $20 mic.    [...]

B00498YZH8|1.0|This movie said thriller and in-fact it is the polar opposite of that.  I am upset with all the 5 and 4 star reviews that led me to believe that this movie would be worth watching.    It is extremely slow, there is no instensity- even when it should be intense.  A complete disappointment.

B001ECQ6E2|4.0|This bluray retouch PQ for this epic with grand scenes is worth rewatching. of course the fake sets, backgrounds and models become more obvious, but the characters also become more intimate, sharper close up views.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|One of the best series to ever hit television, in my opinion.  It has something for everyone...drama, comedy, romance, mystery.  I've watched the series many times over and it doesn't get old!  A must-buy for any tv lover.  Amazon was great as always, quick delivery and great price!
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|I bought this book for my mother to give to my brothers baby. She lives in Florida and he lives in Cali. So being able to record this book so he can hear her voice was very special to her. Also goodnight moon was a childhood favorite of ours. Beautiful book.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I've loved this movie for years and never get tired of it. It's entertaining and funny without needing to go for cheap or raunchy jokes. The songs are fun, and everyone in this movie can really sing. The jokes are clean and smart even if they are a little dark and twisted. I never realized until recently that this was done by Frank Oz. I'm a big Muppets fan, so it makes sense that I love this too. My mom got me liking both little shop and the muppets when I was really little, so if you're like me and too young to have seen these when they were new do yourself a favor and check them out if you like great comedies that are a little different.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I ordered three prenatal fitness dvds: 1. Pregnancy Fitness with Erin O' Brien, 10 Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates, Summer Sanders Prenatal. This is by far the best. I would rate this five stars, Pilates three stars and Summer Sanders two stars. I have been working out regularly so I need to work harder to actually feel like I am getting a workout and this dvd does the trick for me. I feel like I get some decent cardio and toning combined. I feel like I got no cardio from the other workouts (which I expected from the Pilates but not Summer Sanders) but I guess those will be ok for toning. I also like that you get a post natal workout with this dvd as well and am looking forward to trying that after the baby.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|Because that's the kind of movie Sucker Punch is, point blank it's just there to entertain you. It's like a video game with insanely good graphics got together with a comic book and deided to make an anime music vidio mash up, Are ypu still with me. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. As long as you not looking for a complex plot or 4 star acting. Sucker Punch is built on it's action sequences and it's clear from go that this were SAnyder's priority you sort of get the feeling that he circled back around to squeeze a story in with the deadline coming up fast. which is a shame because the story had real potential. leaving that aside and as long as you don't mind having almost the entire plot given away near the begining of the movie, Sucker Punch fires on all the cylinders that most people go to action movies for. guns,knives, a sword. creatures futuristic zombies, lots of things that go boom and hot girls in shrt skirts. it's PG13 though so if strings of profanity and sex are must haves for you, you won't find it here. So why did I give it four stars, because the action was great amd the imagery was fantastic  But above all I liked Sucker punch because I went into the theater thinking that I already know what the film would be and it ended up being somthing else amost entirely. and I love when I movie suprises me. I'll say briefly that a major plus for me was was that Babydoll dosn't stand around looking holding a gun and looking sexy while she waits for the hero to rescue her, I know this deviation from the usual action movie plot is not unheard of... Underworld, Kill Bill, Tomb Raider ect.. it's still nice to see. A quick note on the music. I think not going for a tradtional action movie score was the right call here,the songs chosen encapsulted the film and represented the characters far batter. An orchestral would have been awkward given the overall look and feel of the film. To sum up Sucker Punch won't be winning best picture anytime soon but it is a good time. and I'll be looking out for the dvd.. and I'll be looking out for the dvd.
B0001I55OC|5.0|I don't know why this movie got so many 1 stars but I thought it was worthy of atleast 3-5 stars. I purchased this movie after watching it and still watch it often. It's a great movie and worth watching.
0811870413|5.0|I'd call myself an advanced home-baker and already baked my way through several books on the subject (most recent and popular would be: [[ASIN:1580089984 Peter Reinhart's Artisan Breads Every Day]], [[ASIN:0393066304 My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method]] and [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] ).  [[ASIN:0811870413 Tartine Bread]] has been an amazing discovery: Besides being a successful cookbook, it's a pleasure reading and browsing through it: great writing and nice photographs.  Chad Robertson has been quite specific and detailed in describing each and every step in creating a flavorful and airy loaf.  It does takes some time and patience to achieve amazing results, but totally worth it.  I have tried so far most bread recipes and the breads have turned out exactly the way the book states, and bread-related recipes have been a success so far!.      Just a notice: If you're an unexperienced baker just diving into the bread world, some of the titles above would be an easier start (though not as flavorful and explicit).  But still, if you're a newbie with great patience, careful measuring and tempering skills; try this one, it's worth it.
1400052173|1.0|This was just an excellent idea for a book, but except for the first chapters, which are interesting, it is bad reading and boring. The book is mostly about Henrietta Lacks husband and children lives after her death and is terrible, including details of how she got information out of them for the book.  I am sorry, but their lives are just not interesting stuff to read about. Plus, the author made their lack of education very clear and chose to phonetically express the way they (husband and children) talk, with grammar mistakes and all. There might be journalistic reasons for such a choice (maybe to show that Henrietta Lacks own family members have not benefited from the widespread use of  HeLa cells in biology and medicine, while others are still making a lot of money), but I found that unfair, mean and an unnecessary exposure of Henrietta Lacks survivors. Wanna read a good book about cancer? get (the emperor of all maladies).

1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life Of Henrietta Lacks is the first book about science that I have enjoyed reading.  This book is also about Rebecca Skloot's life is transformed in the process of writing this book that took ten years to write. The lives of everyone around Rebecca is forever transformed too.<br /><br /> I had no idea that the cells from one woman could make such a great impact on science. Part of the fun of this book is learning about hela cells have been used in science over the years.  They have been used to make new corneas to help blind people.  Hela cells have been used to study and cure cancer.  Hela cells have also been used in study of chromosomes and DNA.  I love the scientific aspects of this book.  I enjoyed looking at the photos of hela cells included in this book.<br /><br /> She draws readers into the lives of every member of the Lacks family.  An empathy for each person of the family develops  just reading about their health problems and living conditions.  I enjoyed looking at pictures of the Lackes in the book.  They look like people I would like to know.  The friendship between Rebecca and Deborah Skloot stands out for me.  Each woman influences the other for the better.  Rebecca becomes more spiritual in the book.  Deborah discovers a hunger for knowledge with Rebecca's help.  Their friendship is very touching and adds to the appeal of the book.  Skloot also spends a chapter discussing how people can make a living by selling their own blood.  I found this chapter to be very interesting.<br /><br />The Immortal Life Of Henrietta Lacks is a book that stimulates my mind and warms my heart.  Skloot really makes science fun by writing about the practical applications that hela cells have.  I feel smarter just by finishing this book.

B001P3SA94|4.0|Though not 100% factual, Cadillac Records is a movie that gives the general public some insight into the roots of contemporary blues.  We get to see how the migration of Delta Blues to Chicago came about, where it gets electrified by Muddy Waters, laying the foundation for the British Invasion, which brought American Blues back to the States for mass consumption.<br /><br />In typical Hollywood fashion, parts of this story have been fabricated, or the truth stretched a bit.  Nonetheless, this was an entertaining movie, with great music and fine performances.<br /><br />Most, but not all, of the major players are included in this picture, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, Chuck Berry, Leonard Chess, and Etta James.  There's so much more to the stories of all these individuals, that each would make a fascinating movie in itself.<br /><br />In my book, the more the public knows and is exposed to the history of the blues, which is a uniquely American cultural phenomenon, the better.<br /><br />Keeping the blues alive, means the public needs to be exposed and interested in this great music. This movie was done well enough to wet the appetite, and hopefully stir that interest.
B002VX3RCW|4.0|We got this for my son when he was 4 months old.  He had a great time with it since there were so many things he could do with it.  He chews on the rings a lot and now this is in the car to keep him busy while we're driving.  He's 11 months now, and still enjoys it in the car.

B000001ES9|4.0|Alex Lifeson gets his Jimmy Page on with plenty of interesting, high quality riffs on lengthy solos.  Geddy Lee's exciting shriek grabs you in a good way.  He was at his singing peak in the mid 1970s.  John Rutsey's drumming is solid, if not as flashy or complex as Neil Peart's.  The lyrics are almost rated G, perhaps because Rush got its start playing in public high schools.  This is the album to get your 12 year old without worrying about raunchy, angry stuff typical of American heavy metal.  The song Working Man has profundity for adults.  It's the best track on the album.  It's a great album to listen to while washing the car or doing other chores that require a lot of energy.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|almost always finds the song playing when im driving.  I use this app daily thank you.  Amazon giving it away yesterday was awsome now no more using iphone for shazam and android for everything else

Great songs including Baby and Eenie Meenie  the shipping time was super fast. We rock to his music and plan to see him when he gets to San Diego.  P.S.   My husband now sings along too...
B00395ZYVS|3.0|I agree with whoever said that the book was filled with too many stereotypes on all aspects on adoption. Being a living breathing part of the adoption triad, I can attest to that. The Indian culture made the book interesting-ish, otherwise I was disapointed in the way all three women were portrayed. A bit of a yawn.

B0000004V2|2.0|I listened to this album without any preconceptions.  I checked it out of the library knowning very little about the band.  I never heard of any of the songs. The first half of the CD sounded amateurish to me.  The vocals are difficult to hear through the drone of instruments. It sounds like a band running through its playlist without investing any feeling into it.  The second half gets better.  The songs are more interesting.  To me, \\"Made of Stone\\" stands out as a good song. \\"I am the Resurrection\\" has hints of creativity and life (at the end).  \\"Fool's Gold\\" seems more polished or professional and is good but it's 3 minutes too long. Most of the drumming is second rate.  The lyrics (much of which I had to look up because of the \\"muddied\\" production) are average at best. Vocals are mediocre.  Guitar playing is inconsistent--flashes of some good playing.    After listening to it, I went on line only to find out this CD is supposed to be one of the best Brit CD's of all time.  Never mind all those Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Who, Yes, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, etc. albums that are packed with all those unforgettable songs.  This is it. A CD with forgettable songs, no great lyrics, no great riffs, no great solos (to be fair, \\"I am the Resurrection\\" has some good stuff at the end if you can suffer through the first half of it with its insipid lyrics and awful drumming).  Really, you want to compare this with the \\"White Album\\" or \\"Exile on Main Street\\" or even with the best Oasis albums (another overrated band -- but at least they could compose a song that had some emotional impact)?  If this CD sparked a musical revolution, it certainly had to be by some cosmic fluke.  This is not Zappa's \\"Freak Out\\" or Brian Wilson's \\"Pet Sounds\\" -- you won't find anything that ground-breaking here or anything that comes close to that level of creativity.     There is a reason you don't hear these songs anywhere (someone is going to tell me they heard \\"Fools Gold\\" somewhere)--they are not that extraordinary.  I could name hundreds of better Brit albums off the top of my head. Albums with lots of remarkable and great songs being played by truly great and creative musicians -- who, as a result, become well-known with successful careers.    I guess I am missing something?  Maybe 1989 was just a really bad year for music, particularly British music?    I would recommend just about any Sonic Youth album instead (despite their being American, they were really innovative).  But, apparently, I am in a very small minority.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I was very excited to hear about Adele 21 when it was launching.  It is very soulful and has been well worth the wait.  From the first tracking Rolling in the Deep, to shaking your hips with Rumor Has It, and then covering the Cure's Love Song, there's not a bad track on the entire cd. She's rekindling that soulful and sassy spark that woman were singing with in the 60's , I love it. Well worth owning.
1608870081|4.0|This book has beautiful images and surprises on every page. It is, however, too intricate and delicate to be trusted in the hands of my grandchildren.

Still, it is fun to search for all the hidden treasures...
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I'm new to the music with this cd of the Black Keys.  I heard the entire set on the World Cafe one day at lunch and knew I had to have this cd.  Initially purchased the cd for the track, Howling for You, but then as usual, I seem to fall in love with the entire cd, and then your favorite song rolls over, onto another track.  The sound on every track is theirs but not repetitive, only in the style of sound. I love the vocals and how they range from song to song.  The song \\"I'm too afraid to love you\\", takes me to another place in time with the sounds of a harpsichord. A soulful album that will make you want to just hang out and listen to the entire cd.  It's been a long while since someone came out with their own sound. It's not a pure rock or an R & B only sound. I think they captured a genre that can only be described as \\"cool\\", one that has been adapted from many genres from the past. You will want to own this one. Put on your sunglasses and just hit <play.
0756404738|4.0|This is the sequel I've been waiting for because I loved The Name of the Wind, which shows Kvothe as someone who is amazingly brilliant one minute and makes a foolish misstep the next, possibly because he learns so fast that he doesn't know what he doesn't know.    Kvothe is back, still brilliant, still misstepping.  But this doesn't seem to be going anywhere, it's like an anthology: the author had these great stories and wrote them down but they are separate stories to the same person.  Kvothe meets Felurian, fairy queen who kills men with exhaustion or despair, he learns a martial art that resembles Tai Chi, he works for a lord solving mysteries, he learns why not to kill.  But almost none of this moves him forward in his quest to find and revenge himself on the chamdrians.  Even though these are more episodic, they are great episodes; I'd read it as an anthology but I'd prefer he kept on track to the main point of the story.
B003ASKR2A|4.0|Watchmen is an awesome comic books series that ran for about one<br />year in 12 issues and is written by Alan Moore and published by DC Comics.<br /><br />It is probably one of the best comic book series and graphic novels<br />in recent times including one of the best of the 80's besides Frank<br />Millers Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Year One.<br /><br />The story, atmosphere, characters, dialogue, humor,<br />drama, action, panels, artwork, etc. of Watchmen<br />are awesome and dark and sometimes disturbing<br />especially the ending.<br /><br />This 5 star review from Karl Allen from about.com<br />sums it up best:<br /><br />\\"So you want to know more about graphic novels because you've read about Christopher Ware in The New Yorker, or you noticed that Alan Moore's labyrinthine Watchmen just made Time Magazine's 100 best books in the English language list. But you also wish to avoid stores with names like \\"Forbidden Planet\\" and \\"The Dragon's Den?\\" You want to know what's good and what's bad. What's hot, what's indie, what's superhero, what's art, what's funny, what's dramatic, or simply what's going to be the next basis for a film? What follows is a highly condensed and thoroughly unfair portrait of a burgeoning genre with the briefest of glimpses at only a few representatives. It's only a start.<br /><br />Let's look at Watchmen first. One of the reasons it's been proclaimed great by such<br />disparate crowds as Time Magazine readers and comic book nerds alike is that it manages to spin so much depth into a medium that had been undervalued as a literary resource for so long. In other words, it surprised the hell out of everyone. This is a superhero comic book but Batman it ain't. Released in 1986 and 1987 in individual issues and then collected into a single volume (as is typical of most graphic novels) Watchmen's superheroes are going through some existential angst as they reach their forties and they start to feel a little reticent about running around fighting crime in costume. Officially banned from public servitude, costumed superheroes are trying to get on with their lives after having been forbidden to wear their tights and underwear and utility belts. You'll recognize the skeleton of this plot as having been co-opted in various forms since Watchmen's release, most notably in films like Batman Begins, where the notion of a costumed vigilante is treated in realistic terms, and also in The Incredibles.<br /><br />Where Moore and artist Dave Gibbons take you is much bigger than that, though. Watchmen spans the 20th century in a world where Superman was released by DC comics and instead of spawning an industry it inspired otherwise normal people to create alternate identities for themselves and band together to fight crime. One of their partners in crime-fighting, The Comedian, is murdered at the beginning and as each of the former band of Watchmen reflect on their histories as superheroes we see their influence on world events, from the end of World War II through Vietnam onto the Cuban Missile Crisis and JFK's assassination and up to the book's own bizarre twist of an ending to the century.<br /><br />Moore and Gibbons opened the door through which the comic book and graphic novel (also referred to occasionally as linear art or novel-length comics) would eventually enter the world of respected literature. However, it's doubtful that Watchmen would have made Time's list in 1987. A lot has happened since then to pull Watchmen back into the forefront of Time's consciousness. Artists working in varying forms of the medium have turned illustration into an art form in its own right and have done much to bridge the gap between literature and visual art.<br /><br />Charles Burns, who has been doing commercial illustration since the mid-80's (and who has, incidentally, done a cover or two for Time), has also been hard at work on a graphic novel about a group of teens in the 1970's who are falling victim to an unexplained disease that changes their physical appearance. His bold and iconic artwork can be spotted on every cover of the literary magazine The Believer as portraiture of the different authors interviewed in each issue. Burns was made prominent through his association with Art Spiegelman who himself is best known for the great graphic-novel-to-mainstream-literature jumper Maus, about his father's experience in a concentration camp told in the guise of cats and mice.\\"<br /><br />The second part of the review is continued on this link:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />More info can be found here:<br /><br />From<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\\"Watchmen is a twelve-issue comic book limited series created by writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colourist John Higgins.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is a great movie both my husband and myself have enjoyed watching the movie and will watch it again. Cold days warm fire and a movie are great way to spend a day.
0312360258|1.0|One of the most poorly written, stereotypical to point of offensive, vapid, and clich&eacute;d books I've ever read.  I forced myself to finish entirely because I didn't want to waste 9 bucks.  If this is what is passing for Young Adult Literature now I am appalled.  This book makes Twilight look Nobel Prize worthy.  I want my money back!
0756404738|5.0|Some of the criticisms found here are true. The underlying plot arc does not move forward.  Nothing new about the Amyr or the Chandarian.  Denna is annoying and has done nothing to justify the fact that Kvothe centers his life around her.  Older Kvothe is a depressing mope.  The plot meanders through several different adventures that have only tenuous ties to each other.  Future intended plot twists *SPOILERS SPOILERS* that Denna is the younger sister of the Lackless family and traveled with the Ruh for a time, and that her patron is one of the Chandarian, are easy to spot.    So why 5 stars?  Despite all that, its still an amazing book that I enjoyed thoroughly.    Rothfuss is hilarious, and it comes through in his writing.  I often laughed out loud at certain parts, and I rarely do that.  Every adventure that Kvothe goes on is exciting and fast paced, and there are many surprises along the way.  The time Kvothe spends in the Fae realm is fascinating, and it introduces a character of even more menace than the Chandarian.    So, as I said, the criticisms may be true, but I don't expect a book to be perfect to get 5 stars.  No book is.  The good parts more than compensate for those that were less than good.    This book is the middle book of a trilogy.  I trust Rothfuss to tie everything together, and I don't think we're headed for Robert Jordan territory here.  I'd have no issue if this stretched to a fourth book.    Highly recommended.  Read it not to have all your questions answered (because there are more books coming; this isn't LOST, have a little faith that you'll get your answers), read it to follow Kvothe and friends through an exciting story.  You won't be disappointed.

030726839X|4.0|Overall this is a fine book. It is especially fine in its perspective, seeing Churchill as he was, as his influence with the U.S. waned as the war effort turned favorable. Hast-ings is clear in depicting Churchill's flaws, his grandiosity, as well as his indomitable spirit, so singularly important in carrying Britain through the dark early years of the War. His judgment is that Churchill was a unique leader whose importance to his country's (if not its empire's) survival cannot be overstated. Withal, he shows Churchill as a human being, with all the imperfections and foibles of that condition.      Secondary characters in the drama are also well drawn, and, indeed, there are a fair number of laughs in the narrative. Any reader who thinks Roosevelt and Churchill were bonded buddies will emerge from reading this book with a much clearer apprecia-tion of the fact that their relationship was driven by national interest, not truly by personal affection or even affinity.     Perhaps most significantly for those who think they know their history, the sine qua non role of the Russia in defeating Nazism is well and convincingly told. Hastings does a marvelous job of limning the times and the circumstances as well as the headlines of the major events from 1939 through to the defeat of Germany in 1945.     The author writes, mostly, with clarity and with energy. This reader, however, cannot understand how a manuscript can go through many readings before publication and still not be purged of the writer's mistakes or poor word choices. To be a writer, one much take care--exacting care. Most irritating, Hastings (and his many manuscript read-ers) seem to think that \\"imprecations\\" means \\"pleadings.\\" It does not, nor does it have a particularly British meaning (I checked Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary). \\"Impreca-tions\\" means \\"curses.\\" The word Hastings must have meant, whether he knows it or not, is \\"importunities.\\" When a writer falls into such catachresis it undermines his authority.     Likewise his frequent use of the rebarbative (both to me and to the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary) \\"enthuse.\\" This is not a writerly word nor, clearly, an authoritative word. It's a word that those who are not sensitive to words use. Nor does Hastings know the difference between a restrictive and a nonrestrictive clause--to the detriment of his noted clarity. These may sound like small bore points but they detract from an otherwise outstanding piece of work. This reviewer thinks that both unfortunate and avoidable. The dictionary is the writer's dearest friend, especially in cases where he is absolutely certain of a given word's meaning.    Oh, yes, Shangri La, now Camp David, is not in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It's in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland.
0312330537|4.0|Overall, pretty compelling stuff. The main character was a heroin addict and armed robber who escaped prison in Australia to journey to Bombay. The book begins with the start of his time in Bombay, and covers his various adventures there as he opens a clinic in the slums and eventually gets involved with organized crime. Some of his similes and metaphors (\\"a silence so profound that the breeze against my ears was like a child's sleepy whisper\\" for example) made me grit my teeth, but the story and characters were enthralling...<br /><br />I wrote more at my blog: [...]

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|It has every feel of a classic \\"old Hollywood\\" story. That would explain what seems to be a slower pace compared to what always seems hurried these days. However it devlopes in time to reveal the mystery of identities under strange settings. It is funny if you pay attention to the dialogue something that would normally be missing in a modern spy flick and the location in which the film was shot was perfectly chosen. Angelina Jolie and Depp was the right combination in bringing out the flavor.
B003NFM3JU|1.0|I love this story, I have every version of it that you can find, I wish I would have stopped collecting them before this particular movie came out.  It's not worth watching, I was really disappointed by the time the show ended.   A Christmas Carol is supposed to leave you with a good feeling in the end, this one left me feeling yucky.  I hated it.

B003EYVXTG|3.0|There's no gentle way to say this--\\"Winter's Bone\\" is a bleak, bleak movie. Which is not to say that it isn't a good movie. In fact, it is impressive in many ways. Jennifer Lawrence, in her Oscar-nominated lead role, gives an amazing performance as 17 year-old Ree, the oldest daughter of an on-the-lam fugitive and a catatonic, inert mother. Ree must take care of her two younger siblings as she searches her Ozark mountain community in search of her father, who's due to appear in court. If he doesn't, the court will take over their house and evict the family. With the help of some friends and a morally ambiguous uncle (played by John Hawkes, in a role that also earned him an Oscar nomination), Ree tries to track down her father and preserve what little sense of family she has left. Her search yields disturbing and dangerous results, and Ree is forced to face choices and consequences appropriate for someone twice her age. This is a tale of lost innocence and survival. Not a \\"feel good\\" movie by any means, but certainly worth seeing.

Script had some stuff I did not like, and sometimes i couldn't understand what they were saying but what the hell. Its not the Ten Commandments or Gladiator, but See it. It's an intimate movie with a $70,000,000 budget.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Only rarely do I purchase an entire CD otherwise I purchase each song as a single from another source. When I heard Adele singing Rolling in the Deep, I was compelled to purchase the CD. There is only one or two other artists or groups that I would willingly purchase an entire CD. Adele's voice is soulful, deep and meaningful. All her other songs have me raving about her voice and singing along. Her passion runs deep and it flows out through her music. I look forward to her next CD!

0670022411|5.0|I honestly hate reviews that try to sum up an entire book in a few short paragraphs.  What I want to know when I read a book review is whether or not the reader can rave about the book she just put down or whether she wishes she'd never picked it up at all in the first place.<br /><br />In the case of A Discovery of Witches, I didn't put this book down until reaching the very last page.  That was around four this morning which has left me knocking back the coffee to make up for it, though I might add with absolutely no regrets!<br /><br />Read this book and you're getting more than a whitewash story of a witch who meets and falls in love with a vampire.  For you Twilight Fans out there this is what a story should be.  Substantial!<br /><br />The ending will have you eagerly awaiting the next book that Deborah Harkness certainly must be intending to write...
0375826742|2.0|Pompous, verbose and in dire need of an editor. This entire tome could have, rather should have been the very short prelude to the last book (please be the last book) in this series. I don't know when the intention changed from trilogy to what? quadrology? but almost this entire book is fluff. The book reads like a 13 year old playing with a dictionary. There are a few story threads in there. One keeps believing that if they press on something, anything in Brisingr will reward them for the time invested but unless you're just into the gore and fight sequences it's best to settle down and prepare to be bored to death.  This book get 2 stars for the sheer nerve involved in chucking out this piece of trash rather than a readable conclusion to the series.

B003UYUQZW|5.0|This is a Disney movie but adults don't let that confuse you. It is not only a children's movie. It has love, honor, battle scenes without blood gushing and scenes that are magical and transforming. The plot is good and Jake G is great as lead actor with his accent as Dustan, the Prince of Persia.  Further there is comedy and romance.  It is a tender, movie that holds your interest and moves the plot along. I would recommend this movie for everyone. [[ASIN:B003UYUQZW Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]
B000TEUSJK|2.0|an interesting movie. I wasnt expecting huge production value I mostly wanted to see what all the hype about it was and I found that out. yes its shocking( in a 70's kinda way) but really no different then watching current shows like spartacus.

YOU CAN CHECK MY REVIEW HISTORY, I AM USUALLY KIND WITH MY REVIEWS, BUT THIS IS A DISASTER! I ENJOYED SHIVER GREATLY BUT I WAS UNABLE TO EVEN FINISH LINGER! I GOT 3/4 OF THE WAY THREW BEFORE I JUST COULD NOT CARE LESS ANYMORE WHAT HAPPENEDS! I JUST WASNT FEELING THE LOVE BETWEEN SAM & GRACE ANYMORE. I ALSO WASNT FEELING CHAPTER AFTER CHAPTER OF SMALL TALK. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND STOP AFTER SHIVER. SHAME ON YOU MAGGIE FOR GIVING YOUR FANS THIS RUBBISH!<br /><br />My review when I finished it (finally)...<br /><br />Since I liked Shiver so much I forced myself to finish Linger and this is what I got from it: (**SPOILER**)<br /><br />1) Cole is a new wolf who has a short fling w/Isabel, & Cole is a rock-star drug addict who hates his life so thats why he became a wolf<br />2) Grace turns into a wolf at the end<br /><br />If that makes for an exciting 362 pages then I just dont get it.

Absolutely recommended!
054531058X|5.0|Very rarely does an actual generation come along and bring a book that tops the financial and critical highs. For the older days, there was The Lord of the Rings, Charles Dickens books, and Stephen King books. This generation has seen quite a lot more. Infamously popular books like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (you could call it The Girl With series, I suppose) will come around imported from other countries. Same thing goes for The Hangman's Daughter. However, despite how popular books have become this generation, partly due to the eBook rage, there could be one that really stood out for both children and adults: The Hunger Games.    Now describing Hunger Games would be a lot more easier than summarizing it, so here's the main structure of the series (along with the self-titled book here): Katniss Everdeen, along with her family of her mother and Primrose Everdeen (both named after plants, it is cheesy), live in District 12, a roaring capitol district home to woods that are oozing wealth and an underground market area in a sci-fi setting. Every year, in order to salvage control over the districts, the Capitol has to make children compete in the Hunger Games. Each children is at least chosen once. Your name is chosen in a slip of paper once at 12, when you become elligible. At thirteen, twice. Fourteen, three times, etc. In all 12 districts (there were originally 13, but District 13 was bombed), this rule applies. You can also enter your name in for a tesserae, which will enter your name slip in several more times each one. Katniss, the protagonist of course, has her name entered in 20 times. In each district, one girl and one boy are chosen, so it's a 24-member free-for-all. Last one standing wins.    Katniss is not chosen, however. Her younger sister, Prim, is chosen, with a slim to none chance. However, Katniss volunteers, which you can do if you are related. This has almost never happened. That just goes to show how angry you can feel at family trust, becausenot even older siblings will help you, but Katniss decides to (figuratively) sacrifice herself for Prim. The boy is Peeta Mellark, who is a son of a local underground market baker. He first had a major interaction with Katniss when her family was starving and gave her fresh loaves of bread to make sure she didn't starve. It turns out later that Peeta is in love with her, furiously, but Katniss takes this as a strategy in the arena to help earn audience approval. Their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, decides this is the case.    That's basically the all-around story for this debut. This was the first time I had ever been introduced to a Suzanne Collins book, so I was outright impressed in every sense of the word. The Hunger Games is haunting. It's violent, scary, romantic, epic, suspenseful, and thought-provoking. Evil. The world of Panem is an interesting, unique experience.    One of the things you can relate to in the book is how realistic this utterly fictional book is. The dystopian districts you can relate to if you think about it. The Capitol is harshly strict about how people talk about them. Utter a single joke about them and they'll whip you until you're blind and have no feeling in your limbs. They can torture you. (Though torture doesn't vividly happen until the second book, more so in the third) They're your master, you're their puppets. Play be their rules, you may live to see daylight again tommorow.    There's a good blend of action and romance. Peeta and Katniss's staged relationship in the camera-littered arena (for Katniss, it's staged, that is) is one of the main points of the book. When Peeta's leg is horribly mangled by a sword from another opponent, Katniss does everything in her power to help, but Peeta easily comes off as the stronger, in terms of protectiveness and devotion to the other partner, and more sacrificial one, going to radical extremes to try and save her life, just narrowly killing himself in between to help her see their beloved district. And the violence, though not explicit as it is in other books, is quite expressive here. There is a violent death somewhere before the third part of the book, and a very emotional one, in fact. There's other sacrifices made by the other arena opponents as well, including a death towards the end that was vital to Katniss and Peeta's survival.    The arena is an interesting place to visualize. It's a large, temperature-controlled, outdoor arena full of caves, trees, and beach shores. There's a lot of hiding in trees, behind-rocks, and stealth involved in the strategies in the arena.    There's a large sense of humor involved in the Hunger Games. Katniss and Peeta's almost innocent poking fun at their mentor, Haymitch's alcohol addiction. Silly comments about the Capitol accent. There's a dark sense of humor that powers through Hunger Games' intense, though somewhat ridiculous, storyline.    The characterization in The Hunger Games is fantastic. The psychotic, oddly hollow nature of Cato, primarily the \\"antagonist\\" in the arena. Katniss's stealthy, quickly violent techniques, but good heart of personality. Peeta's heartwarming devotion and assistance with Katniss. Even Katniss's seemingly stupid prep team have some of the best personalities in a book. This isn't a book where only the primary or main secondary characters in the book are enjoyable. The arena fighters that have an interaction with Katniss, even including her sister Prim and her hunting friend Gale (both of which are not exactly developed enough until the later books)  have distinct personalities and natures to them.    The writing. Oh my god. The descriptions in Hunger Games are boundary-smashing, they're groundbreaking in every meaning of the word. The endings of each chapter are suspenseful and full of questions, which can keep you turning the page. The close, careful, patient details put into describing the arena, Panem, and interactions with characters. The kisses between Katniss and Peeta aredescriptive. Everything about the series has been written with care. The author actually means to suck you in and are devoted. Whereas I thought Collins' previous novels, like the notorious Gregor, were good, but were flawed and didn't have enough details and character development. Hunger Games is a greatly mixed bag of details and writing techniques.    Could quite possibly be one of the greatest books of this decade, and of all time. Highly recommended.

B000MV90B2|5.0|Just to steer you in a little better direction, I would recommend that you purchase the following edition of this film (it seems a little better quality and definitely offers superior packaging.)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000E1E2N6 WATERLOO - by Sergei Bondarchuk (Import)]]<br /><br />Through a comedy of errors, I ended up with both DVDs and I like the *Russian* edition much better. So here is the body of my review:<br /><br />Only rarely is one lucky enough to encounter a terrific film treasure such as this one. Of course this account is a true one but beyond that, it's so well-told here that I wonder how I might have overlooked it until now.<br /><br />Here we have the story of Napoleon's ultimate demise, his defeat by the British Duke of Wellington at Waterloo (in Belgium) who was aided late in the episode by the Prussian Army. The Emperor of France had suffered a monumental defeat in Russia, where he had lost nearly half a million men in 1812 and it wasn't long before he was exiled by his adversaries to the Island of Elba with several hundred of his loyal guards to keep him company. [For yet another more epic masterpiece regarding Napoleon's win in Austria and subsequent defeat in Russia, again directed by Ukrainian director Sergey Bondarchuk, get this specific edition of [[ASIN:B0000714B0 War and Peace (Special Edition)]].]<br /><br />About ten months later, Napoleon escaped his island home only to return to France, there usurping a briefly-ruling King Louis XVIII [played by Orson Wells in the film], and again declaring himself Emperor. Almost immediately he had to face Wellington's challenge, the latter having picked his ground carefully.<br /><br />This 128-minute 1970 movie is superb on several fronts:<br /><br />1. The battle scenes are epic with no shortage of extras, all in flawless period costume and equipped with the appropriate accoutrements of war. All the troop movements were carried out in an astonishingly precise manner.<br /><br />2. The cinematography is first-class, here depicted in letterbox format, (Panavision, Technicolor.)<br /><br />3. The film includes several actors of The First Water, Napoleon being played by Rod Steiger who was perfect in every sense for this role. The Duke of Wellington was played by Christopher Plummer who yielded a slightly hammy performance but was likely inspired to do so by a somewhat lyrical script. Dan O'Herlihy also co-stars.<br /><br />4. The filmscore by Nino Rota is quite excellent, very appropriate for such a presentation.<br />The film itself represented a cooperative effort between Bondarchuk and producer Dino de Laurentiis. This was perhaps a lucky thing since it meant that Bondarchuk was permitted to use the Soviet Army for the battle scenes!<br /><br />5. With the minor exception of a little poetic license, the historical account of all that transpired is largely correct.<br /><br />You won't get hurt on this one - highly recommended.s first-class, here depicted in letterbox format, (Panavision, Technicolor.)<br /><br />3.

B004L49K20|5.0|I generally do not listen to Duran Duran, at least not since late 80s. Here I found nice promotion on YouTube and decided to purchase a CD ( instead of usual MP3 download).   The album is great, very high quality music, perhaps the best album so far.   However, do not buy this album if you want to move it to your portable player as it will not move, it's DRM-ed. Just like that. You can listen to a CD at home, perhaps in your car, but if you like me working outside all day and listen to your portable player with millions of songs, - well forget about it. I mean I can move the whole Family Guy Star Wars trilogy onto my Samsung YP Q2, but apparently Duran Duran is \\"special\\".

B0000042GM|5.0|I've seen a few negative comments about this set from other reviewers--I wanted to assure potential buyers that although Katchen is, perhaps, not the most lyrical of performers, Brahms is (contrary to his reputation) not the most lyrical of composers, but rather (and especially in his major piano works) a rugged intellectual. Performances of the three piano sonatas and the Handel and Paganini Variations should not try to 'make nice' but rather should measure up to Brahms' challenge, and Katchen does that in an exciting way; in particular, his performances of the three sonatas, early works of which there are not THAT many alternative recordings, take them seriously as independently valuable, and not just as token examples of \\"young Brahms.\\" If you are looking for a recording of the later, short pieces and want performances that go in the \\"pretty tune\\" direction, you can always supplement Katchen with a disc of Rubinstein, or whoever--I'm not saying this is bad, but I wouldn't want to hear Rubinstein take on the Paganini Variations.

If you want a concise, focused and accessible explanation of how the capitalism and its denizens failed us in the derivatives crisis of 2008, this is NOT the book. Despite his obvious economic bona-fides, I got the impression that the writer used his novel-like style to obscure the fact that he didn't really understand the issues involved.

After I reached the second and third, however, I began to sense why this is one of the best fantasy novels written in recent time. Quite simply, the story-telling is marvelous. Rothfuss weaves a simple story, but one that makes you want to read more. I cannot wait to read the second.<br /><br />Kindle Edition: Formatting is good!!

I had initially hoped he would play the old stuff, but I was blown away.  I don't know what went wrong in the studio, but he should release a live version.  I'll stick with the YouTube, Jimmy Fallon appearance, etc.  Richard supposedly said he was going to strip down the next album and I think that is a good idea, but if this project helped him get back on track ( and he really was the best I've seen him in NYC Mar 23 since the Urban Hymns tour ) then that's cool with me.

0060899220|5.0|First of all, I don't know how this book escaped me for so long; however, I can state that it was, unequivocally, worth the wait. Bourdain's \\"I don't give a s**t what you think this is how it really is\\" narrative voice cuts through the pretense of a business that VERY often takes itself too seriously and provides searing insight behind the curtain of the restaurant world. I wish like hell I would have read this prior to my years in the business, as 'Kitchen Confidential\\" serves as a manual for what not to do and what to be aware of in the culinary world. The shady dealings, larger than life characters, home kitchen suggestions, rock star excesses, etc. are all beautifully tied together by an author that, despite all his shortcomings, perseveres because he simply loves food and its preparation. I can't guarantee much in this world, but I guarantee you'll find something in this book to love.

0756404738|5.0|Rothfuss manages to maintain a consistently well written narrative in book 2.  The people who inhabit this universe just feel intensely real, in spite of the fantastical events that happen.  Unlike many fantasy novels (or most, perhaps), characters are rich and multilayered yet also coherent, and the magics are not arbitrary.  With both books, I was heartily sorry to get to the end. Especially since the wait for number 2 was so darn long--I hope book 3 arrives with a little more alacrity!   This is probably the best written fantasy series I have every read, and I have read quite a few!

B003VR5PPY|1.0|I got this game based on all the positive reviews here and I was completely disappointed. All I got was a sore thumb from pressing the button to get to the next dialogue screen. I love reading but the reading in this game was slow and repetitive. The basis of this game is that you need to get through numbered doors  with only 3 of the characters using the numbers on their wristbands to do so...for example if you want to get through a #2 door you have to use characters with numbers 4,5,2 because 4+5+2=11 and then the 11 becomes a 2 because 1+1=2 or a #5 door would be 7+3+4=14 and 14 boils down to 1+4=5 seems easy enough, right? The game assumes you are an idiot and explains this at each new door in dialogue that takes about 10-15 minutes each time to get through when you already know what to do!! Also you can't make the dialogue move faster and it moves fairly slow, and even though there are 9 doors on the ship that you are trying to escape  from you only get to choose 3 to go through before the last door. So you get to solve about 3 puzzles in a game that takes a good 5 hours plus (because of all the dialogue that is just retelling you things you already know and pointless movement by your characters!-for example you try an elevator you go down there is nothing down there you come back up, and you read all about this for about 5 minutes-why even put it in the game?) Very, very, boring game. Selling mine back ASAP.

Lena is a shy, slightly self-conscious, average teen girl who follows the rules and after witnessing first hand how those infected, including her mom and older sister, suffered from the disease she is more than excited counting down the days to when she will finally be cured. All that changes though when she meets, Alex, a boy who opens up her eyes to what she would be giving up if she proceeds with the cure.    The world that Lauren Oliver created in Delirium was so terrifying to me. A place where you don'teven show love for your own children when they get hurt, or when your pets are brutally taken from you and you don't care, to not even being able to choose the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. Everyone just lived an existence numb to everything without feelings. It was so heartbreaking. The book had me in tears at times, because of how unfathomable some of these situations were.    What I loved most about the book were the short snippets from various books and poems that were in the beginning of each chapter. There was one poem in particular that I found really disturbing. It's pretty much a nursery rhyme to scare children of those who haven't been cured yet, or \\"Invalids\\" as they were called.    Chapter 6  Mama, Mama, help me get home  I'm out in the woods, I am out on my own.  I found me a werewolf, a nasty old mutt  It showed me its teeth and went straight for my gut.    Mama, Mama, help me get home  I'm out in the woods, I am out on my own.  I was stopped by a vampire, a rotting old wreck  It showed me its teeth, and went straight for my neck.    Mama, Mama put me to bed  I won't make it home, I'm already half-dead  I met an Invalid, and fell for his art  He showed me his smile, and went straight for my heart.  - \\"A Child's Walk Home,\\"Nursery Rhymes and Folk Tales, edited by Cory Levinson   pg 56. (arc)    Isn't that just tragic. The person you love will end up hurting you much more than the actual monsters you fear.    It's always a peeve of mine when the characters do their whole spiel of dying for another person, and Delirium was no exception. I understood how the \\"deliria\\" makes people not think clearly, but suicide is always way too dramatic of a solution. That was probably my only problem with the story.    Delirium was beautiful yet tragically devastating all at once. The end just left me in complete shock and the way it ended makes it seem so final which I strongly hope it isn't. It's no surprise I'll be anxiously waiting for the sequel to come out in 2012! When Delirium is released in February 2011 I will definitely be buying myself a hardcover copy. I can't wait to read the story again.
B003Y5H50G|3.0|\\"Limitless\\" gets off to a strong start - a dicey character hands out \\"smart pills\\" that really work. Pop one, and you're suddenly brilliant. In the case of this down-and-out writer, that means not just getting started on that novel stalled because of writer's block, but finishing in just a few days. Of course, being that brilliant becomes addictive.<br /><br />The story moves along well. First, his dealer ends up dead. (What would a smrt guy do with that clue?) Then,to finance his venture, he borrows from the local loan shark (not so smart). Next, he flaunts his new-found ability as day trader, building up his financial head of steam - and I have to wonder whether taking such a high profile so fast was really a good idea.<br /><br />Things get out of hand, though. The loan shark gets his hands on the pill, and dicovers that being a smart crook is more fun than just being a crook. And there are side effects - the kind that kill not just you, but maybe other people, too ...<br /><br />This should have been an August movie. Just a few too many things seem just a bit too implausible for anything but a silly season flick. But, if you stifle your own intelligence, it's enjoyable enough.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0385339585|4.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did.  Initially I thought the book a thriller, full of intrigue and bad guys bent on finding the elusive Rachael before Nate, a spine-tingling narrative of drug lords, villainous heirs, and heart-pounding escapes from the same.  Not so.  Instead it had a far gentler message of redemption, or repairing relationships, of escape from personal demons.  The ending was perfect for this story and left me with a contemplative smile on my face.  Not everyone would enjoy this since John Grisham is noted more for stories like The Firm and The Pelican Brief, but for me it was wonderful.

B003RS7DDY|5.0|I had purchased season 4 of Dexter on DVD and unfortunately, this episode was damaged on the DVD.  It was such a treat to be able to find it quickly via my Roku and Amazon on demand and get it going on my tv within a couple of minutes.  When you are watching and hooked on a Dexter episode, every moment counts!  And all of this for a couple of bucks.  I couldn't be happier with the Amazon on demand service. And as for Dexter,  well you either like it or you don't.  I really like it.  it is some of the best character development that has been played on tv, the writing is incredibly creative, and if you like dark comedy, you won't find any better.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I'm already a giant Les Mis fan, so I pretty much like every production I've ever seen over the years, but this is truly amazing. Where the heck did Alfie Boe come from? I'm in love. And yes, Nick Jonas is no Michael Ball, we can all agree to that. But I honestly felt he held his own with Empty Chairs. He may not have a rich tenor voice, but his tone is solid. And I've always thought Marius is supposed to be a little younger and more immature than the rest of the guys, so in that sense this casting fits. Everyone is phenomenal, orchestra included, and the editing of the video itself really makes you forget that you're watching a staged production taped in a huge arena, it feels very intimate.
B004J4WQ46|4.0|Let's cut right to the chase, shall we. \\"Angles\\" is a good, solid Indie Rock album. No, it's not groundbreaking, but it's not stale either. If you find comparisons to an artist's earlier work helpful, \\"Angles\\" is a much stronger album than the Strokes' last effort- it might be their best since \\"Is This It?\\" There's some freshness here in the arranging and musicianship. On \\"Angles\\", the strokes launch successful forays into pop-reggae (Machu Pichu),'80s New-Wave lite (Two Kinds Of Happiness), '70s Steely Dan (Gratisfaction), and Indie Electronica/Dance (Games). The latter track could have been quite at home on Casablanca's recent solo album. The lyrics are mostly the same old, same old from Julian, but the guitar work is top notch and the rythm section swings throughout. Metabolism is the weakest track here- it sounds like a \\"First Impressions...\\" outtake. The album finishes strong with Life is Simple In The Moonlight. Overall, \\"Angles\\" is a very satisfying listening experience.     Bottom line: If you can get over the fact that this record is not \\"Is This It? [Part II]\\", nor is it their long-anticipated, career-defining masterwork, you will enjoy this album.

B004T82B2E|3.0|George was one of those guys many of us 60's kids grew up with.  He was an amazing musician, performer, and moved into a wonderful, gentle space in the 70's and 80's.  This tribute is well deserved and if for no other reason, I would recommend getting the concert, in honor of George.<br /><br />the first part is devoted to Indian music, which of course was very important to him.  Indian type music with it's 1/2 tones and all is just not for me and although I watched that part, I was tempted to fast forward ahead to Eric Clapton and the rest to enjoy that portion of the concert.  The 2nd part of the concert was indeed more traditional rock and George Harrison that most of us know and remember.  It was pretty good but still not at the energy level or punch of perhaps, Concert for Bangladesh, etc.<br /><br />he was the \\"quiet Beatle\\" who eventually soared spiritually far above the other three in my opinion.  this concert was put together by Clapton and friends in honor of that spiritual rising.  That alone, makes it a worth while purchase in my opinion.

B002VRZEYM|3.0|An eye-opening documentary that gives American consumers a glimpse into the illusory world of where our grocery products actually originate.

B002RVZV9K|4.0|\\"It Might Get Loud\\" is an excellent documentary for those who want to look into the different creative processes behind some popular rock guitarists, both young and old.  Some have critizied Jack White's role in this film but it's obvious.  He presents himself as a low-tech, go-by-feel, minimal guitar effect guy.  He is anti-The Edge in this regard, as we see The Edge explain his dependence on rack upon rack of effects to obtain his sound.  Jimmy Page is the elder scholar throughout.  The glimpse of his guitar collection, guitar cases lined up in a storage area, is impressive.  I didn't expect him to be as articulate as he is in this piece.<br /><br />IMGL is a very well directed and produced film.  Shots are interestingly framed and audio is excellent throughout.<br /><br />A very good watch for anyone interested in how guitarists may go about their creative process.

0312370849|5.0|Riveting, well told and so clearly human that I had a very hard time believing/feeling that this is fiction.  In all reverence to the facts and the people who lived through these tragic and heinous times, it is what could most definitely have happened.

A valuable example of good writing. It will change your life and break your heart.
0882709194|2.0|i am disappointed that the book has the 54 paged heavily baptist introduction in a nice legible font, and then the rest of the book has very small font with narrow margins.  it's really difficult to read, and it seems designed to be that way.  i'm Christian, and i appreciate having some nice pat on the testimony with the encouragement in the front, but really - i would have liked to read the origin of species without having to take frequent breaks that come from headaches from reading such fine print.  ultimately, it's only $5, so i'll read it, but probably donate it to the library after that.      also - why do so many Christians feel that evolution threatens their beliefs?  it only shows us the history of our planet.  we could very well be interpreting the creation story incorrectly...are we going to be on board with the medieval Christians in their fear to allow the earth to orbit the suN?  facts are facts.  athiest evolutionists are irrelevant to this work, and frankly so are overzealous religionists, regardless of where they stand.     last.  they also stamped a baptist church nameplate on the inside cover of the book.  just in case you didn't know what their contact information was and in case their attempt to dissuade you from appreciating anything Darwin contributed worked...well, now you know just how to reach them, too.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|Spielberg's films are so finished that it is hard to identify any work that has gone into them.  Nevertheless, he consistently turns in strong films with good pacing that hold your attention.  Munich is one of these films.  With a great supporting cast including the evil villain from the old James Bond Moonraker and a memorable perfect set of breasts, the film has a lot going for it.  An excellent job of re-creating the look and feel of the 1970s.  Violent and will disappoint supporters on both sides of the Israeli-Arab conflict.

B004IE0G58|5.0|Green Day's [[ASIN:B004IE0G58 Awesome As F**k (CD+Blu-ray)]] album is a wonderful homage to all the reasons that many people are huge fans of this band. Having grown up listening to Green Day starting with Kerplunk, there has certainly been quite a bit of growth in the band right alongside me. Green Day is, without a doubt, one of the most entertaining live bands in the business. Watching Billie Joe work a crowd is something akin to watching a master artist paint a portrait. He does so without seeming to expend any effort at all and you find yourself mesmerized by the pied piper once again.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of seeing a concert on the 21st Century Breakdown tour and this CD/Video Disc set captures the magic of that experience quite well. Although it isn't as heavy as Bullet in a Bible, it packs a wallop on its own and will leave you begging for more. It was really nice to see Green Day include some of their older, less commercial hits on this album like \\"J.A.R\\" and \\"Going To Pasalacqua\\".<br /><br />The interesting thing about this album is that I was expecting something different and more political. Instead I got whimsical punk music and I was delightfully surprised by this. It is no secret that Green Day has been hitting hard with pro-intellectualist overtones in their recent work and this album tones down the overall message just enough to make it a delightful romp through an evening with Green Day. The message is still there, it just isn't the foremost feeling that this work conveys.<br /><br />I think that Green Day has been one of the most enduring and surprising bands of all time and they certainly have found their share of critics and adoring fans alike. I have often thought that had Green Day re-recorded their stolen \\"Cigarettes and Valentines\\" album instead of moving on to cut \\"American Idiot\\" the world of music would have suffered for it. (Oh the title track of that lost album is on this disc. It's great and definitely has a younger Green Day feel to it.)<br /><br />To sum up this review: (TL;DR) If you are a fan of Green Day you will probably like this album. If you are a fan of live Green Day you will definitely love this album. If not, you probably wont. (Also, why are you reading this if so?)<br /><br />Five stars.this review: (TL;DR) If you are a fan of Green Day you will probably like this album.

B00395ZYVS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and hated putting it down.  There is no point in summarizing the plot, as others have done so.  The book focuses on what it means to be a family.  The author tells the story primarily from the viewpoints of the three main women: Asha, her birth mother Kavita and her adoptive mother Somer.  It also examines the difficulties for a couple who were born in countries with very different cultures and whose families live around the world from one another and the problems of identity for their adopted daughter who looks different from others in her California school.  The story looks at the roles of women and how they are treated in different strata of Indian society.
B0042816YK|2.0|You guessed it, not my turn to pick the movie. In the past this worked for the best, getting exposed to good movies I would not had picked otherwise. This time though I was itching for a magazine well before the movie was halfway through.<br /><br />A woman in mid-life crisis ends her unfulfilling marriage to her equally immature and directionless husband for no other major reason. The divorce is messy with a lot of guilt to be distributed around. A brief (cougar-)affair ends equally badly so she embarks in a year-long journey to redefine herself.<br /><br />The journey starts from Italy where apparently she learns to appreciate life's little pleasures and how to enjoy them guilt-free. This part made me hungry for good Italian pasta with fresh tomato sauce and basil but little else. Having said that I have been to Naples and (with all due respect to my Napolitano friends), one can find much better-tasting pizza in New York.<br />By the way, when someone decides to accept her body no matter its imperfections and goes shopping for larger jeans, she does not then proceed to force the zippers of ...smaller sizes.<br /><br />India was next and it was a disaster. The guru she has traveled so far to meet is visiting the US and her disciples run her ashram like something between a hostel and a Scientology sweat-shop. She receives no enlightening guidance except some overused bromides from a Texan in his post-alcoholic guilt trip.<br />I love Indian culture and have a great respect for Indian people. However, unlike SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, this movie will not make you want to visit this mesmerizing country.<br /><br />Finally, Bali where she meets again a toothless old medicine-man/palm reader. She copies some notes; she runs a short but effective charity fund; and she finds lust/love in the sad eyes of a Brazilian divorcee. What did she learn in the previous year: apparently nothing because she is about to run away from that relationship as well. Will she? Well, at that point point I could not care less.<br /><br />I gave it 2-stars solely for the travelogue images.point I could not care less.<br /><br />I gave it 2-stars solely for the travelogue images.

1593272774|4.0|If you have worked with LEGO instructional materials before (any of the school kits) you will be well aware of the utter lack of instructional documentation.  This book is very similar.  Small machines that can be made with less than about 50 parts (guesstimate) are photographed with their machine type symbol, i.e., two circles and thread = pulley, in the upper left hand corner of each even page.      The photos are perfect - you can really see how to copy the creation.  Gear ratios are numbered quite clearly.  However, there are no verbal explanations - if you don't know your simple machines, you might want to call in an engineer.  That's the primary reason I gave it four stars.  I would have appreciated a few words.    If you have a youngster who is captivated by LEGOS and machines - this is the book for you.  And you will know exactly who I'm talking about:  The kids that take apart your car key fob, the toaster and the vacuum.
B00005JPAO|5.0|After watching \\"The Kings Speech\\", I dug out \\"The Queen\\" from my movie collection. I had enjoyed watching it before but enjoyed it even more the second time. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair were phenomenal. I didn't really care for Alex Jennings as Prince Charles but then again, I don't really care for Prince Charles. Prince Philip was very well played by James Cromwell although portrayed as harsh, cruel, and uncaring.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the weeks after Princess Diana's accidental death in 1997 and intersperses actual news footage throughout. A newly elected Tony Blair immediately gives a speech but the royal family isolate themselves in Balmoral and refuse to acknowledge Diana's death publicly. Queen Elizabeth believes in handling everything privately, Tony Blair, newly elected, tries to pursuade her that the people want more. Prince Charles, played rather sympathetically in this film, also tries to influence the Queen but she does not agree. The press begin to harshly criticize the royal family, the public becomes angry and begin speaking out against the royal family, and Tony Blair continues to plead with the Queen to reconsider and 'be there' for her people.<br /><br />Mirren is fantastic as the dignified yet somewhat vulnerable Queen. The part where the family finally return to England and walk amongst the flowers and notes left outside the castle, many of the notes expressing harsh feelings towards the monarchy, gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes. As well, the included footage of Diana's brother's actual speech was incredibly emotional. The Queen finally speaks publicly but I am very curious as to how close this speech is to the real one and plan to google it as soon as I finish this review.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is an extremely well-done, gripping, emotional and thought-provoking film. Blair once again is portrayed very positively but one wonders what really transpired during those weeks since many of the conversations between Blair and the Queen would have been private. It's also interesting to note that no real footage of the royal family where they can be seen is included.<br /><br />To me, a sign of a good movie is when you are left wanting to know more about the events depicted in it.

B000002G6J|5.0|As a student of jazz and an aspiring jazz pianist, I've had the pleasure of discovering much of the best jazz music of the last fifty years with an older, more inquisitive approach. I've always thought that Jobim's songs were among the most beautiful and that his chord progressions were among the most innovative in the genre. So when we began playing \\"Triste\\" in improvisation class, having never even heard the song before, I just decided to pick up this CD so I could learn the song, but also to add some Jobim and true bossa nova songs to my collection. That was all well and good, but as soon as I heard the title track, I stopped analyzing and just enjoyed. Truly, the music on this album is bright, authentic, fun, lovable, danceable, and more than listenable. I marveled at Jobim's mastery of song writing. The production values of the overall recording are high. The artwork, fanciful, yet down to earth. (I like to stare at the giraffe up close while listening to Triste.) Each song stands on its own as an indelible statement of Jobim's genius. I suppose some Latin music hating troglodyte somewhere would not enjoy this recording, but I feel pretty certain that this CD offers at least a couple (if not more) songs to love for everybody else. And I'll just add that if you do buy this CD, you might as well put away the rest of your collection for a while, because you're going to want to play this one over and over for a while.

B003UESJFG|5.0|I'll leave the spoilers and plot reviews to others.  I watched this movie 8 times in 2 weeks.  The options, including the popups for movie trivia (Blu Ray) make this movie easily one of the easiest to re-watch of all time.
B00023GFOA|5.0|This is no doubt one of the greatest albums of all time.  It is a nice, thick, sturdy piece of vinyl, shipped with unbelievably excessive amounts of packaging.
0060936223|5.0|One of rocks strongest voices shares her story, with a book about herself, her true love for a true friend, art and the New York rock scene in the 60's, 70's and 80's.  Always a poet, her refreshing prose was a revelation.  But, how can you go wrong with a cast of characters that includes Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, Warhol, etc... and the greatest city in the world.  I loved every page.
B000W93CXQ|4.0|It tells about a very common thing...that still some people have no clue about. Theres always someone popular and unpopular. And the book makes you really think...almost vow not to be mean to anyone again. This book shows the horors that some kids go through in school in an original way
B004SKHJF2|1.0|This app is not worth 5 bucks. And on top of that,  it won't even work any more.  It tells me to redownload from the amazon market.  And pay 5 bucks when I got it for free yesterday?!  No thanks.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This is just the type of story I love.  It's not deep, it's not distubing, it just made me happy.  It was so funny at times I literally laughed out loud.  I was hysterical when Emma was thinking \\"If he says \\"G spot,\\" I will die. I will die.  I will die\\"  I love living vicariously through characters newly falling in love.<br /><br />I admit it, I love Chick Lit and this book did not disappoint.
B00007G1ZC|4.0|The colors, the sense-provoking images, melding traditions and customs with the modern day world, and the stuff of nightmares becoming all too real...  This is the work of a master. The first time I viewed this film, it was being played in a small bar/restaurant where I was enjoying my dinner.  It totally took my attention from the meal, and I sat and watched it, not knowing what I would experience next.  Many nights later, it evoked some of the same images in my dreams several times since I first viewed it.
B002W5GPVE|4.0|This text provides a very good overview of case study design, but I didn't find it to have enough detail to answer some questions. Probably not best for the most advanced researcher, but for beginners and intermediates, seems to be very useful. In combination with other texts on qualitative research and case study methods, provides a very good resource for understanding this quite complicated methodology. My background is in quantitative research, so this text was useful in helping to make a new transition to a new method of research.
B003L77G8I|1.0|Over half of the episodes were so awful with the Hannah arc and the characters not acting themselves that I can't imagine the last few episodes would convince me to buy it. [[ASIN:B003L77G8I Bones: The Complete Sixth Season]]
031606792X|5.0|I thought Breaking Dawn was brilliant and a satisfying end to a great set of books.  Anyone that hated this book - probably hated the entire series.  I think that begs the question - why you would read FOUR pretty long books and then take, I don't know, an hour and a half writing on Amazon about how you hate it. I suggest a life rather than a better book for all those people. Stephenie Myer is brilliant - people care about her, her characters and her stories.  I thought the whole series was pure magic and I enjoyed every second I spent in that world (and continue to do so!).
0061733199|4.0|The SAS SURVIVAL MANUAL won acclaim upon its publication in 1986, both because of its clear organization and the illustrious career of the soldier behind it, John \\"Lofty\\" Wiseman who served for 26 years and participated in operations all over the world. Having examined a range of survival manuals, I decided to sit down and read this one in depth, and all in all I'm happy I did. There are clear, often colour illustrations for edible and poisonous plants and for tying knots, while the instruction on how to properly butcher a deer or sheep are easier to grasp than in some other manuals. There's a fine section on eating insects that is missing from other guides.<br /><br />Still, one wonders how much this venerable old manual has actually been revised and corrected for the 2008 edition when it still says that quinine is a good treatment for malaria. Or when it still recommends the folk remedy of smearing chemicals on a tick to remove it instead of firmly pulling it with tweezers. Also, the final section on surviving disasters in the city feels unnecessary, as I imagine most readers are thinking of the wilderness when they pick this up. But learning proper survival would require more than just reading this book, so perhaps those inaccuracies would be corrected in further research.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Easily helps you determine the strongest location to put your router and also the least crowded channel.  Better than all the other wifi tools out there and I've tried them all.  The audible meter helps you find weak or dead spots in your house so you can rearrange your equipment for better reception.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|An incredible visualization of available WiFi networks. Gave me a great recommendation about changing the channel of my network to boost signal. I'd recommend this app to anyone who wants to see &quot;under the hood&quot;.
B0044CG71G|5.0|I was just introduced to Fringe in the middle of it's second season.  I've been an addict ever since.  This season is no different.  I love how it flips between the alternate universes.  It keeps the show moving.  I also love how its not a recycled medical or cop drama.  How different could they possibly be?  Fringe is original and entertainig.
B001ATN3QS|5.0|This is just one of those movies that belong in any good collection. First-rate cast, good story, great scenery, great all around.

B0047WJ12K|1.0|Maybe it was just me because this movie was nominated for an Oscar, but I didn't enjoy or understand this movie.  The scenery was stunning, but I thought the plot left something to be desired.
0316017922|5.0|Dear Mr. Gladwell,   First of all I would just like to say how phenomenal I found your book. Now that I am in my forth year in the music program, primarily the choral and theatre groups, it is very interesting to see the different levels that my peers are at as far as musical ability is concerned. I've probably practiced for about 1,000 - 1,250 hours throughout my entire high school career, which is where my interest in music began. I still cannot play the piano and don't know what each letter is on the scale but I can follow along, whereas one of my peers who grew up taking piano lessons every single day knows almost as much about theory as my teachers do. I never really reflected on how much importance it was to be raised and be taught a specific subject and I was actually curious, if you were planning of having children and wanted them to major in a particular field, how intensely would you follow the information about how to be successful (as far as practice goes)? Also, after conducting your research do you wish that you had been born at a different time or place and wondered what life would be like had you been successful in a field other than literature?   After reading the chapter, Rice Paddies and Math Tests I started to wonder what would happen if elementary education in the U.S. should incorporate more foreign languages, primarily Mandarin Chinese not only to improve the ability U.S. students can perform math, but also to improve English. I've found after studying four years of Spanish, that when you compare the grammar structure of one language from another, you begin to understand why the languages are constructed. If this started early enough, not only would students better understand grammar concepts but also could incorporate how to count with Asian numbers to get work done at a faster rate.   Throughout your book, you mention that opportunity along with time and place is key to being truly successful. In the chapter Marita's Bargain, do you find believe she was successful not only because of the opportunities at KIPP, but also because of the pressure she was given? I've found in my own experiences that I do best when under pressure, and when I don't have a deadline breathing down my neck I tend to take my time and don't work as diligently as I should. If this is the case, why not add this sense of pressure in education as much as possible, not because stress gets things done, but because it gives people the motivation to want to get things done.   Again I would like to thank you for providing the world with such detailed explanations as to how the most successful people got to where they are today. Hopefully, future generations will read this book and use it to learn how to be as prestigious in whatever field they pursue as you are in literature.    - Chris Shriver  Hatboro - Horsham High School Class of 2011
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The App Store has too many flaws, and Amazon insists that purchased (not sure about free) apps have a constant data connection or they don't work, which drains battery.  Also any app you download from the store will haunt you forever since there's no way to delete it from your Amazon account after, even if you have removed it from your device.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I'd never heard of Gregg Allman before I bought this CD. I was doing some music browsing and constantly saw his name coming up with the type of music I enjoy so decided to give it a try. I'm very please I did as this is now one of my favourite CDs - love it and would recommend it to everyone.
