6304698623|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen.  I got this movie as a VHS for my own &#34;little princess&#34; when she was about 7 or 8 years old and both of us now have the DVD of it too.  The color and sound was good as was the entire movie which inspires us to see ourselves in a good light no matter what the circumstances, to see others in a good light no matter what their circumstances, to keep our hearts genuinely and tenderly united to one another early on and throughout life, to use our imagination to see the best now and in the future and to even feel loved and receive gladness from not only those who love us but also from that which is the source of love and happiness, in love with us all.

I don't know if it's because this book had no real plot or action or because Ky's voice and Cassia's voice sound identical or if I just didn't care for the story, but I did not enjoy this experience.<br /><br />I am now a little scared to read the next book because I don't want to repeat this horrific experience.

B002GIBVV6|5.0|This movie moves your heart.  And shows wonder and beauty all around you.  It shows just how very fragile and easily injured is our humanity from hurtful or sad things that happen to us all.  And it shows the beauty of having a loving nature like the big hearted servant girl who never takes offense or sees anything angainst anyone versus the obsessive and possive nature of Mrs. matlock which is always imagining the worst while genuinely thinking what she is imagining is true.  The faithfulness and compassion of the little boy that comes to see the children is amazing.  And the ending is great.  I recommend this to both adults and children alike.  It will bring the child back out in you.
0345803507|3.0|This book was definitely a rollercoaster ride.  There were ups and downs and loop de loops and I think I enjoyed it for the most part.  I am going to start off with the things that I found wanting in hopes that it will get it out of my system and then move on to the good bits.<br /><br />Now, I realize this is an erotica novel.  I went into this series knowing that and in the first 2 books, it didn’t bother me at all, but it did in this one.  These 2 literally go at it three or four times back to back.  They have sex and then 2 seconds later they are ready to go again (and again and again).  Then the next night is the same thing.  At this point, I just felt like, “hello? Ana? Maybe you should go to bed and get some sleep so that you’ll actually be on time for work in the morning? No? Well, it was just a though!”.  Ana’s character flaws really started to show up in this novel.  I don’t know if anyone else noticed it because the whole series is focused on how screwed up Christian is, but Ana is no cake walk.  She is seriously a completely irresponsible character.  I won’t give away spoilers, but some things happened (that I totally saw coming) and I just wanted to scream at her “How could you be so stupid? No, you can’t blame this on your assistant because it was your responsibility!”  I really started to feel like she was completely unworthy of Christian.<br /><br />Now, for the things I enjoyed.  For this whole series, I loved watching Christian grow and change and mature.  Yes, he may be fifty shades of screwed up, but he is trying to change, and in the end, that has to count for something.  His & Ana’s storyline plays out a little predictably, but it still good and engaging (for the most part).  I also loved all the minor characters, Kate and Elliot and Mia and Taylor and all the characters you don’t get to see much of because Ana is too wrapped up in Christian to really notice them.  It’s not bad, necessarily, it’s just yet another thing that irritated me.  I hate it when girls suddenly get a boyfriend and it’s like nothing else matters.  You know, those friends that stuck by you when everything was falling apart and will still be there should this fall apart too?  Yeah, they aren’t so important apparently.<br /><br />I was trying to focus on the good.  Apparently I can’t.

1451696191|4.0|I think I made a mistake.  Right after I finished this, I was too busy to write the review and then I ended up watching the movie over the weekend, so obviously I want to talk about that but this is supposed to be a book review, not a movie review.  As always, I'll endeavor to do my best.  Here goes nothing.<br /><br />I don't know exactly what I was looking for when I started this.  I think all I really knew is that it had an interesting name and that there was a movie adaptation coming out for it starring Logan Lerman and Emma Watson.  I think I was expecting an amusing coming of age story with a decent amount of angst.  I got so much more than that.  It reminded me a bit of exactly how I felt when I started It s Kind Of A Funny Story.  It starts off with simple enough issues and delves much deeper than I thought it would.<br /><br />The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a story about Charlie, who is nervous about starting high school because he has never had many friends and high school seems particularly cruel.  Upon entering high school, he gets teased and tortured and only makes one friend, his advanced English teacher.  Then he meets Patrick and Sam.  They are both seniors but they take pity on him and invite him into their circle and it makes his freshmen year a very memorable one.<br /><br />Charlie is a very complex character.  He is so very intelligent and reads all the time, but can't help but be affected by his best friends suicide last year and his favorite aunts death when he was little.  Because of these issues, he seems to go in and out of depression, but he doesn't talk to anyone about it because he's parents are always saying they shouldn't complain because there are tons of other people out there who have it much worse, so he feels like he doesn't have the right to complain.  He just tries to deal with it himself and that works well until he screws up with Patrick and Sam and is shunned from the group for a month or so.<br /><br />I think it is a great novel.  It's a novel that takes you to unexpected depths and leaves you with an undeniable sense of hope.  What more could you ask for?eat novel.

B00002E224|5.0|Did you ever get into a conversation with a perfect stranger on a long trip?  Did you ever take off with that stranger just for a day or so to see what would happen?  That's essentially what the two characters in this movie did.  I am in my 60s now but can remember a time when I was in a similar situation and I think this movie captures that feeling perfectly.<br /><br />  The characters are young, attractive and still trying to figure out what they want out of life.  They are not very far down that road but have experienced a few romantic bumps along the way.  I really enjoyed the dialogue.  (In this movie, if you don't like the dialogue there really isn't much else to like about it.)  I saw it twice in three days and appreciated it more the second time than the first.  The director does a great job of showing how, as the day progresses, the two open up and become more attracted to each other. At first the situation is a little awkward and they have to rely on a Q&A session to ease the discomfort.  Later, the conversation becomes more natural and more personal.  At times the conversation can be painful but the pain never overwhelms the magic of the moment.  Of course much of the magic is the expectation that they will never see each other again.  (It's amazing what you will say if you never expect to see that other person again.)  But as they become aware of how strong their feelings are for each other, it all becomes a little more complicated.<br /><br />This movie has what so many movies today lack--great dialogue, character development and authenticity.

0345803485|4.0|I first decided to read this when I read somewhere that Ian Somerhalder had expressed interest in this role should a film be made.  Now don’t quote me on that because I most likely read it on some gossip site, but regardless, I wanted to read what had sparked so much internet chatter and Ian’s (possible) interest.  After reading it, all I can is YES, PLEASE.  Even though Ian doesn’t quite match up with the verbal description in the novel, I had his pretty mug in my head as Christian Grey.  I think another reason I picture Ian is because alternative is picturing Robert Pattinson and no offense to the rabid Rob fans, but he just doesn’t do it for me.  I also went into this knowing that it started out as a Twilight fanfic and because of that, for the first 50 or so pages, I kept picking out the uber-Twilight things and tried to line the characters up.  I am also insanely addicted to a well known fanfic called Wide Awake and I kept comparing it to that as well.  Was this the wrong thing to do? Definitely.  Did I do it anyway? Of course.  How did it measure up? Well, it’s not quite as simple as that.  Once I got past the first 50 or so pages, the comparing part of my brain shut off and the story took over and I’m left with no real point of comparison between these different works.  For those looking for a comparison, this is nothing like Twilight so it’s not worth even talking about.  To Wide Awake, it’s very different.  Christian definitely reminds me of dark Edward, but he has manifested his issues in a completely different manner so the comparison ends there.  That is the only big similarity.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is a seemingly normal college student getting ready to graduate and Christian Grey is a millionaire with deep-seated issues.  When Ana is forced to conduct an interview with Christian for a sick friend, her world changes and not necessarily for the better.  Christian shows obvious interest in getting to know her better even though he repeatedly warns her away claiming that he “isn’t the man for her”.  Ana, far from understanding his cryptic warnings, pursues the relationship further only to be completely shocked to discover that the type of relationship Christian desires to have with her is something not even her wickedest fantasies could conjure up.  Her world is thrown upside down when he hands her a contact outlining exactly what he wants.  In the simplest terms, he wants to be her master….in all things.  Ana is beyond shocked and scared by this but she wants a relationship so she swears to try.  Meanwhile, Christian is having to redefine what he really wants because he knows he wants Ana and that she doesn’t fit into the role he wants her in.  He values control over all things and that precious control seems to evaporate whenever she is around.  Will she play the submissive to his dominate? Will he change his mind and settle for a normal relationship? Well, you’ll have to read it to find out since these days I’ve striving for spoiler free reviews.<br /><br />I think I was blown away by this book.  The characters are so well thought out and the novel has so many ups and downs that you really don’t know what is coming next.  I loved that Ana really thinks hard about this relationship and negotiates the terms, staying firm on the things she absolutely will not tolerate and caving on the things she thinks he has to have.  I felt like this was really a struggle for her, as it should be. It wasn’t just “oh, he wants to torture me in his red room of pain….well, I don’t want to but I really wanna screw him so okay”. I also like that even though this is all through Ana’s perspective, you can see Christian is struggling to please her.  It’s obvious to everyone but Ana that he is smitten with her and will almost anything to keep her.  Kate (Ana’s best friend) was also a great character.  She is fiercely protective of Ana but understands that she should back off when Ana wants.<br /><br />And the smut.  Jesus christ, the smut.  I read romance novels on a regular basis and this damn book had me blushing.  Not an easy feat.  I guess that’s what I get for reading a book labeled “erotic fiction”.  I felt like I was watching a BDSM porno in my head….which brings questions to mind of how they really intend to make this a film.  The director is going to have to a genius with camera angles is all I’ll say.<br /><br />And the ending.  I really want to be angry with the ending, but I find that I can’t.  Maybe because it doesn’t feel like and ending to me &#60;spoiler&#62;or maybe it’s because I know their separation won’t last long&#60;/spoiler&#62;. But either way, I was irritated but not upset with it.  It truly didn’t feel like an end.  It felt more like the author sat down and wrote the entire trilogy and then since the publisher’s are keen on 1500 page books decided to break in down to 3 novels and this was a logical stopping point.  Did anyone else feel that way or was it just me?<br /><br />Anyway, it was a really addictive and enjoyable read and I’ll be going out this afternoon to pick up the sequel.

B007SGM2TQ|3.0|This was the last in a series of books that I have read about the less than evidence-based foundations of medicine. The net is that I will never hear a doctor (or tv commercial) talk about how pill 'x' reduces problem 'y' by some miraculous amount without wondering how much profit it represents. And how for a person of my age and physical condition pills are required to force certain clinical test values to a certain number. And how much harm has been hidden or glossed over in the process. We are desperately in need of evidence-based practices in many areas. Big Pharma is one area where it would seem that the profit motive overwhelms the mantra to do no harm. This book simply enumerates cases where that driver was seemingly in control.

0312360258|3.0|This book had good bits and bad bits.  The biggest bad part is I abhor Zoey Redbird.  Seriously the girl irks me beyond belief which is hard to deal with in a novel written in first person.  She's whiny and selfish (and trust me, it gets worse as the series progresses).  BUT, I love the world around her.  I loved her friends, her enemies, and the mythology of the House Of Night.  This book also had enough mystery to keep me going when I really wanted to run screaming &#34;Damn Zoey, shut up!&#34;.  Would I really recommend this book to anyone? Probably not.  There are too many plot wholes and I have to many issues with the main character to submit a friend to dealing with her, but I am going to finish the series myself.  I have a morbid curiousity to see how it ends.<br />Oh, and for any Christians who are contemplating reading this, if you are offended by bad portrayals of the Christian faith, steer clear of this.

Ethan and Lena struggle to hold on to their relationship despite the constant turmoil of Lena's life and all the unknown facts Ethan discovers about his and his families past.  But the death of Macon was too much to take and soon Lena is pulling away and Ethan is having visions of Macon's past.  Now the countdown to Lena's seventeenth moon has begun and no one knows what the future holds for her.<br /><br />Rating this book was just as hard as rating the first.  From the moment I started this story, I was instantly irritated at it.  The pacing was much slower than the first book with a lot less action in the beginning.  For most of the novel, I was reviewing it in my head, watching its star rating drop lower and lower as I thought up scathing things to say to warn people to stay far away.  I felt like the authors were hiding in a dark corner, laughing manically because they knew I was suffering.  I could hear them whispering in my head, \\"Ha! We fooled you!  We gave you a great first that lacked the things you hate and now, just when we have lulled you into a false sense of security, we are going to throw every clich&eacute; you loathe right at you!\\" The hero and heroine splitting up, love triangles, angsty angsty angst.  Not to mention the amount of southern clich&eacute;s that are so in your face, I have a hard time ignoring them.  I live in the south, in a relatively small town (so small there is one lonely grocery story and not a single fast food restaurant) and I can assure you that I don't know half the people there, much less every single one and all the gossip associated with them.  I can attest that there are plenty of small-minded individuals here, but not everyone is.  I'm almost insulted by the way they describe their world.<br /><br />The more I read, the anger I became.  Lena's being a moron, Ethan is just letting it happen, Link is so hung up over Ridley, he can't see straight, and then they introduce a new female character who is naturally attracted to Ethan.  Lena ends up running off with another Caster/Incubus hybrid and the tale is a pile of everything any book with Middle Book Syndrome has.  There were parts where I just had to read something else because the urge to stop completely was too much to take.<br /><br />Then, about 400 pages in (a pretty long way to go to get to the good parts, I know), things started to get better.  Ethan stops being an idiot and goes after Lena.  Link & Liv (the new annoying point on the triangle) follow him to what appears to be a make believe land and they battle darkness to save Lena.  The last 100 or so pages are well worth the annoyances of the preceding ones.  Everything comes together in ways I wasn't expecting.<br /><br />I really recommend it for anyone who enjoyed the first novel.

1476712042|3.0|***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS***<br /><br />Abby Abernathy’s life is exactly what she wants it to be, safe and quiet.  Moving to a small college far from home, Abby is far away from her rather unsavory past. Now, Travis Maddox is vying for her attention and she knows he’s exactly what she is trying to avoid and yet she can’t help but be drawn to him.<br /><br />Originally I gave this four stars, but the more I think about it, the less impressed I am and that’s why it was demoted.  I gets 3 for the same reason Twilight got 3, because regardless of all else, I did enjoy it while I was reading it and became immersed into its world.  But, just like Twilight, after I finished it and really started to digest it, I started to notice flaws and issues.<br /><br />The biggest one being the two main characters.  Abby’s backstory is interesting, I’ll give you that, but it’s not that bad and Travis’ sole excuse for being an abusive idiot is that he’s mom died when he was very young and he didn’t learn how to love.  AW, now isn’t that just precious? Um…wait…no it isn’t.  Especially considering how much of a idiot he is.  He’s uber-jealous and controlling (you know, in that Edward Cullen “I’m only trying to protect you.” way that drives me nuts), he sleeps around with anything that walks but gets pissed when Abby so much as TALKS to another guy even though the pair of them are “just friends”.  Abby’s reason for avoiding the relationship are a bit stupid.  Yes, Travis has a temper and gambles a bit, but there is a big difference between that and someone who makes their living playing cards.  Her daddy issues really get in the way and I just couldn’t get behind it.  Then, towards the end of the novel, they play that breaking up and getting back together game.<br /><br />Wow this review is short, but I’m really too disappointed to rant properly.  I was expecting something along the lines of Easy by Tammara Webber (which I’m always expected when I pick up a new adult book these days) and I just didn’t get it.  I’m at that moment again when nothing seems to satisfy me.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thought Dr. Alexander did an excellent job of telling his story.  I've told all my friends about it.  It inspired me to read about more near death experiences. I honestly don't look at death the same anymore.
B006O6F932|5.0|After reading the reviews I was surprised what good quality this is, and what an ingenious design.  It folds up into a very small easy to carry shape.  We have had no problems.  I agree with other commenters who've suggested that the problems people have are caused by not reading the directions and installing the proper supports.<br /><br />My daughter (7 years old) thinks its the greatest thing ever.  She saved up her own money to buy it.  She plays with it daily since she received it about 3 weeks ago.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|My mom and I love this app. I like mind/speed puzzles and this one is fast paced and easy to play. If I'm not careful I can waste loads of time without realizing it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I watched this movie with my son and fiance and I must say, it was such a great story. I did not know it was a true story at first, since my fiance simply put it in the DVD player and hit play. Great movie, beautiful story, I recommend it for anyone who loves those loyal dog type of movies.
B006WPWH4E|4.0|A nice App.  It works very well.  I have spent hours entertaining myself and avoiding boredom.  Over all, it's very good.  The display is well laid out, and the game play is very smooth, including options to set how you wish to play.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|Taxi Driver follows Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a lonely and depressed taxi driver, as his character deteriorates due to disappointment after disappointment in his own life and his frustration with the harsh world around him. Taxi Driver delves deep into the mind of the lonely and misunderstood.<br /><br />Taxi Driver has a deep and thought-provoking storyline- a story that many can relate to because of its realism and accuracy. In my opinion, the story is really about a character that is lonely and misunderstood; I'm sure others will find different themes in this film, and that's okay because film will be interpreted differently by different people. Much of the film intensely builds up to a stunning climax, and it works well. The ending of the film is darkly ironic, and I liked it; however, I won't comment further to avoid spoiling it. It's a great story that manages to send significant messages without sacrificing entertainment. Robert De Niro as Travis was spectacular; he really captured this character; the rest of the cast was also amazing.<br /><br />I own the Blu-Ray of this film. It is a digibook case that comes with one blu-ray disc, and several picture-cards. The picture and sound quality on this disc are superb; definitely a high-quality master similar to the high quality \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Psycho\\" transfers. A must-own blu-ray for fans of this film and film collectors that want the definitive version.<br /><br />Overall, Taxi Driver is a compelling psychological drama/thriller; whether you're looking for entertainment or a film with a deep message, this film delivers. I highly recommend a purchase.<br /><br />Taxi Driver has strong violence and blood, some nudity and sex.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed the story.Wanted to read it instead of see it,I will do both now! It was my first Nicholas Sparks novel I will read more in the future.

B002V091IO|1.0|I was curious. Recommended by a magazine: A romantic read for Valentine's Day!  Heck NO!  It wasn't. I gave up after chapter three and skimmed through the rest. The writing is bad. Em and Dex, the main characters, are unlikeable. The dialogues are long and drawn out.  Funny? I don't think so. The end (I flipped to the last pages)is just as dull and boring as the beginning. Do not waste your money on this book. Luckily, I borrowed it from the public library.  It will be returned immediately.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have recently been burned by two mouse purchases. First was a really cheap $5 mouse where one of the buttons went out on it within weeks. The other was a $20 mouse which had a faulty button that would register one clicks as two and the optical reader was spotty on it, causing the mouse pointer to wildly move around in a small area. I decided to finally just spend money on getting a decent mouse, so I sorted by customer review and found this one.<br /><br />I have to say that I am 100% satisfied with this mouse. It is very smooth, I like the feel of it, and I get the impression that the company that makes it stands with their product. I've already recommended this product to other people, and if I ever need another mouse I will definitely buy it from this company.

B008XCJ03K|5.0|I had never heard of Passenger, but after giving it a quick listen. I feel in love with their music! This is by far one of the BEST albums I bought in 2012. There isn't a single song I don't like on this album.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|WOW.... i have to say i was amazed. i wasnt expecting it to be as good as it was, and boy was i mistaken.  First off this movie is NOT for young kids. i dont know how it escaped a pg13 rating (especially by some of the unexpected imagery and content) but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone younger than 12 or 13.<br /><br />the colors are very vivid and set the tone quite well.  and even though its creepy, its still very cute.  basically its about a girl who feels kind of put off by her parents who are extremely busy and have no time for her. she finds her way to an idealistic version of her world, but as she will learn (as is the overall theme of this which another reviewer mentioned) the grass isnt always greener on the other side.  Whether she's able to escape it or not ill leave that for you to find out :)  this is a tim burton movie after all, anything can happen in the crazy worlds he creates.  Enjoy!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Installed in dark closet ; works perfectly I would recommend this to friends or family to use in<br />places where you can save by not using electric.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I like this type of game and so far this game is keeping me interested. the graphics are good and the story line is interesting.
0671207822|5.0|This book is a must read.  Don't let yourself go through life any further without gaining new perspective and &#34;meaning&#34;, by reading this book.
0765325950|1.0|I would rate it better, but since the Author sold out and didn't bother to release a Kindle version of it for me to read, and instead chose a ~$20.00 hardcover only to make more money.  I'll have to wait or not bother buying it.<br /><br />The author released the Prologue via Kindle, you'd think he'd do the same for the full book.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|From an old C B,  l am so proud to be an American. Thank God we have men like our  Seals.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|A truly &#34;feel good&#34; movie-especially at the end of the show.  Highly recommended viewing for any audience although there is a little violence and language.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|I like all of the older Star Trek movies with Leonard Nimoy. This movie brings the 23rd century back home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Downloaded this game for my kids but I soon took over. I cant put it down. I am constantly trying to beat my high score and complete the new mission sets. I love the update each month that puts the setting in a different city.  I would definitely recommend this game for anyone of any age level.
B004G600A4|5.0|I think for a cartoon it is very life like, emotions are real, of course, cartoons have the advantage of doing stunts without dangerous side effects. The movie was filled with a good quality morals & a story with a happy ending. This is about as good as you can make a movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun!<br />Had second thoughts about downloading the app, now I'm glad I did!! Awesome game, wish it didn't take so long to get energy!

B005OZE9SA|5.0|This might be a bit of a bare bones unit when compared to other audio interfaces on the market but it gets the job done well and looks cool too. I run 1/4 inch jacks for guitar and bass through it and use a 1/4 inch headphone adapter to run sound through headphones instead of monitors. The inputs also allow for female XLR jacks for microphones. The unit came with some compressor, eq, and reverb software plugins. They sound good. There are RCA inputs on back and a USB input which powers the unit. So far, this has been a hassle free, budget friendly unit that sounds great and is easy to use. I use it with recording software for music. I recommend it for home recording and would buy it again.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Watch It! The twist and turns of the show are worth the time for sure, keeps you guessing the whole way.
B000069HUF|5.0|This is a remake, but the qualities of the movie runs along similar lines of the original story, The new story has not tarnished its real qualities, though there was some changes, but this is also a good story too.

B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a pretty good light.  Very bright and nice to use as I usually have my Kindle close by.  I use it all the time.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|While at times this book was physically painful, I could not stop reading it!  I really felt like I knew the characters and became attached to them, and while I couldn't stop reading it, I was sad that it ended.  Great read, highly recommended!
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|This is a good movie but I don't think it's a great movie. On the plus side, the performances are great. On the minus side, the story has several threads which never really converge. The impending death of Clooney's wife, the sale of his giant beach estate, his search for his wife's ex-lover, his difficult relationship with his kids; all these themes are explored with sensitivity, but they never manage to build up into an integrated picture.<br /><br />But what does stand above and beyond all this is the music. I have never listened to native Hawaiian music before and the soundtrack moved me so much that I promptly purchased it even before I finished watching the movie. I found that a lot of the pieces come from a famous islander named Gabby Pahinui. The music is just amazing; evocative, rustic and effectively conveying both bitter and sweet emotions (apt to the movie's themes). Most surprisingly, it made me nostalgic and wistful about a land I haven't even visited. It almost made me feel like I had lived in the state for years.<br /><br />Something has to be said about a movie soundtrack that's so good that it eclipses anything the movie has to offer. It doesn't mean that the movie is bad, it just means that the music is extraordinary. I would recommend the movie, but I would independently recommend buying the soundtrack even if you don't watch the movie.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love his music and voice. good study, exercise, and fun music to listen to.  worth the purchase to add to my cloud music!

B000R3NNDQ|4.0|I purchased this book in preparation for a church retreat, as we begin planning our next steps.  I've read several books of this type, but enjoyed the presentation via the penguin story more than most.  The plot was compelling and the problem/solution description was as realistic as it could be when you have talking penguins.  I'm looking forward to the discussions of the book this weekend, and hope that, like our tuxedoed friends, our group finds a way to explore and grow.

B008220DIC|5.0|Admittedly, I'm a bit of a film snob. But I truthfully think most people really don't quite understand what a director actually does. To most, he's like a conductor of an orchastra; yes, we can see him waving his hands about; we know he's important, and we know the orchastra is following his direction, but beyond that, we're kinda clueless. The why's and how's are a bit of a mystery. If you're one of those people, there is no better film and no better director to really SEE the person's impact than The Master, and Paul W.S. Anderson's masterful writing and direction.<br /><br />Unlike most filmmakers, Anderson doesn't structure The Master to rely on its plotting, rather the real intrigue and quality of the film originates from the strong performances by its actors, its compelling characters, and, most importantly, the subtle, complex and downright confounding interaction and progression between those characters.<br />The Master opens with one Freddie Quill, played wonderfully by Joaquin Phoenix. A former World War II sailor, from the beginning we see that Freddie is a particularly vulgar and disturbed individual; a drifter, with an obsession for sex and a tendency to become needlessly and senselessly violent. Then enters Philip Seymour Hoffman's Lancaster Dodds.<br /><br />In many ways, Lancester resolutely contrasts and contradicts Quill's character; whereas one exists as a rudderless, animalistic creature, the other exists as a supposed beacon of sophistication and intelligence. It's a feigned intelligence however, as it's quite obvious that Dodds is little more than a well-disguised con artist, masquerading as a doctor, physician and strangely religious figure to a handful of misguided by enthused followers.<br /><br />Freddie soon finds himself taken under Lancaster's wing and we journey with the two through their bizarre and long-arching relationship with each other. To not spill any of the movie's considerable secrets, this complex symmetry and contract between these two rather troubled characters drive the movie to its ultimate climax.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, upon initially reading the film's synopsis - and even viewing its trailers - I found myself pretty wholly disinterested in its plot. I mean, what's so interesting about a drifter and a half-hearted approximation of L. Ron Hubbard? Conceptually, I really don't think there is anything. But its in this avenue that Anderson's try mastery of film and human drama really becomes evident.<br /><br />Due to his unique writing style, every scene becomes intriguing in its complex characterization of its performers; slipping only the subtlest of hints behind their motivations and psychologies, and every scene is made downright enthrawling due to the inspired acting of its cast.<br /><br />To say that Phoenix and Hoffman turn in great performances would be a stark understatement; they chew on every line and every syllable of their characters' dialogue, they imbibe a a strange and perplexing physicality into their performances, and ultimately, they give testament to the art and pure entertainment of acting itself.<br />Of course, as already proven by his previous film, There Will Be Blood, Anderson continues to display a masterful hand at cinematography and visual filmmaking and, once again, chooses a brilliant composer to craft a score perfectly suited to the visual and thematic elements of his film.<br /><br />Ultimately, all of these considerable successes culminate in an ending and resolution that, honestly, most will probably find more confusing than rewarding, unfortunately. Requiring multiple viewings (or possibly simply googling &#34;what's the point behind the Master&#34;) to fully understand and appreciate.<br /><br />However, if you're willing to take the time and keep your mind open to the unconventional nature of The Master, I believe, it will very much be a worthwhile, and enlightening effort.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  Many OMG moments.  The ending was not exactly what I wanted, but maybe will lead to a sequel.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Read 'Gone Girl' and found it to be fascinating, clever with a disppointing ending.  But so many said that you had to read 'Sharp Objects' that I bought it and started in.  Not for the faint of heart.  The images are disturbing, the characters without redeeming value and evil is palpable.  The novel is dark, certainly not for everyone.  Between the images it leaves and disturbing, graphic pre-teen sexuality, I wished I had not read it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Pitch Perfect has a good story line and the performances are fun to watch.  Predictable ending, but enjoyable to watch.
0525958002|4.0|I absolutely loved this book!  This was a great read and gave a lot of insight into how the band, Duran Duran was formed, how they struggled, and then ultimately found success.  However, if you're looking for gossip and tell-all memories, this book is not the source.  John Taylor talks more about the ups and downs of the band, but mostly his own personal struggles and inner demons that led him down certain paths.  Taylor was very honest and forthcoming with personal information and I respected his story even more for his candidness.  (I wish we could have learned a little more about the other band members though.)
B00466HN72|5.0|This movie arrived in new condition and on time.  Great blu ray movie.  A good family movie.  I think we have this one memorized the kids loved it..as well as the adults.  Music in this movie got my granddaughters dancing and they are 1 and 2 1/2.  Would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The family is so disfunctional that it is hard to believe they stayed together for as long as they did. As the misadventures of the adults caught up with them, the entire family is forced into a different directions in life. The bond that kept some equilibrium among them all was punctured and each member of the family became a lost soul in an ugly world.  .
B006LSZECO|1.0|Long. Convoluted. Boring. I spent a lot of time doing a 'fast forward'. No satisfactory--even interesting--explanation for all the loose ends.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a fun read that kept me very interested and always wanting to know what happened next. I am a very avid reader who is always looking for suggestions from friends. A friend who likes books such as Gone Girl and Discover of Witches recommended it to me. And I will definitely recommend it to others.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was recommended to me from other running friends and I must say I have not been disappointed. I think this is a must read for anyone that enjoys endurance running or is considering endurance running.

B0083Z614S|5.0|This, I think, is a must read for every child. I first read it as a teenager and I was sad that I hadn't read it earlier. I think it would have helped me when I was younger to see that I wasn't alone and to realize the importance of other people in our lives and in finding something that we love. One of the greatest books of all time.

1594203334|2.0|Being married to a Frenchman and having a French MIL I had to have this book when I saw it. There were a few things I didn't know but overall I found most of it to be just plain common sense, something the French have in abundance. When I was done my MIL wanted to read it and she laughed through most of it. She said that the one thing the French knew well was that anytime someone gave you advice the best thing to do was ignore them.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is an awesome read! The characters had a lot of depth - I felt like could be friends of mine - and I think about them long after I finished the book. This is a story about moving on from pain and the lemons that life gives - a REAL LIFE version of finding your small silver linings in unexpected places. I recommend reading the book BEFORE seeing the movie (which was also great) because the movie is a romanticized, 'HOLLYWOOD ENDING' version of the book. The book is more like real life - something people could really relate to. Loved it!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Definitely better than the weather.com app. The radar is better than the weather bug app, but not as easy on the eyes.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I have been waiting on the Blu-ray edition to be released. It was worth the wait. This is the best restoration I have seen. I really enjoyed the interviews with David Lean,Peter O'toole & Omar Sharif. I also enjoyed the extensive behind the scenes making of the movie. I saw it in the in 70 MM format when it premiered in 1961. GREAT movie!
B000GCFG7E|4.0|This was my first Jack Reacher novel and I will definitely read another.  The action was fairly steady and there were several surprises all along.  Good read.
0307592731|5.0|Normally I stay as far away from Oprah's recommended books as I can but luckily for me I read it before she picked it. Cheryl is not always likeable, in fact I never really liked her at any point in the book and yet...I loved the book. Some of her choices were, to me, nuts but as far as what she did I was proud of her. We all make mistakes, we all make the wrong choices, she was just brave enough to write about them for all of us to see and that takes courage to put it out there and be judged.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is AMAZING and so sad. I can't wait till they make it into a movie. The characters were awesome and I was so engrossed in the story, I missed my stop on the train several mornings. I think classifying this as young adult fiction will keep adults from reading it and they will miss out. However, all young adults SHOULD read it so they can appreciate their health and empathize with ANYONE who has cancer/any type of health problems. It was truly well written and great for all ages.

B008N1LL42|5.0|The movie started out a little slow setting the scene but once the action kicked in, it was non stop.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat thru the whole movie.
0307943232|2.0|It's a very typical John Grisham book - if you've read one, change the characters and you've read them all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I loved the scenery, felt like the characters became our friends, and the story line was engaging:-)
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Loved all the Om Nom games, and Pudding Monsters does NOT disappoint!!!<br /><br />Thought-provoking puzzles, with none (so far) being too difficult or frustrating.
B0052U6JLC|4.0|I've run in both the toe shoes  toe shoes and sonic glove, and personally i like these more. I felt less rocks when running and you don't have people come up to you and ask &#34;what's with your shoes?&#34; or &#34;are those comfortable?&#34;. Also the flat soles are decent for dead lifting and squatting. The only drawback I've encountered  is the shoe laces are a little sort, hence the 4 stars.
0307970299|3.0|Good read, but predictable.  Story takes you through her slow process of healing.  Glad she added an ending so that the reader knew she ended up ok.
B001NT057K|5.0|If you were my generation--Baby-Boomer--how could you not like it. And I still do whenever I need to be cheered-up.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Include letters of the songs and some ilustrations the music as always perfect! very nice book included, delivery and everything OK!
0374105235|5.0|I saw Ishmael do an interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and thought, &#34;What the heck - I'll give it a read.&#34;<br /><br />Find the interview somehere on the interwebs and watch it, then buy the book and read it.<br /><br />It's a great book.<br /><br />Find it. Watch it. Buy it. Read it. Enjoy it.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who is an avid outdoors activist. This is a great quality tool/knife, and I list tool because it serves so many purposes other than just a knife. Many people have had the same complaint that this knife has a bad handle when wet and to heavy as a whole. This is an issue that is easily solved by adding &#34;Tennis racket tape&#34; (from any sporting goods store) around the handle which will negate the slippery issues (wet or dry) all the while adding better water resistible grip and a super comfortable grip which fits like normal in the sheath causing no other issues with the addition. The weight as far as I am concerned is a ridiculous complaint because how can you make that complaint when the weight is clearly listed in the product description. The weight is what it is in order to be able to accomplish each task as listed in product description. This product is great and I would recommend this product to anyone avid in the outdoors or just likes collecting knives or weapons in general. I said &#34;HOOAH!&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|It is just a sappy love story. Not sure why people  really liked this book. Reading it made my cringe by how cheesy it was.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I like Gerard Butler and in my opinion he was the best for this film. It goes to show that God can work in a person's heart ONLY if they are willing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow this is a great game!! If you are a temple run fan  this is great!! I am addicted!! You simply press start slide your finger up to jump,down to duck,and left to right to go to the side. Through out the game,you will face many more challenges including speeding subways,daily challenges,beating your Facebook friends scores,and even more!!I hope you enjoy the app I know I do!!!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|It's so hard to come to the end of a Kate Norton novel. What  a gift she has for story-telling.<br />Her mind goes places for clues and scene-setting that leave me hanging from a cliff. And a few hundred pages later, we have the ending...all wrapped up and presented as a gift.  Wow, wow, wow.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|the game is pretty good although it takes a long time to load on my kindle and is just slow. overall it is good
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Gripping story wonderfully written. Rich cast of characters. Just enough technical details to make the characters and the setting both believable and mysterious.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Great app. Love the graffics, and sounds. The aircraft are wonderful. Could use a F 18,  F 22 Rapter, and F 35. The up grade made it more difficult to shoot down advisary fighters, when you added a very small circile,  the size of a miro dot, that does not line up with the shoot down box.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I love everything about this book and have reread it many times I would recommend it to anyone love it
B007EECSFA|5.0|I don't know another author who writes with such enticing detail and cohesion. She never kept me hanging with a previous mentioned clue. The ending was beyond imagination. Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read in my 60 years of reading.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is a very addicting series.  I have not missed one episode.  It just keeps getting better and better.  I will be very unhappy when they make their final season which I hope won't be for quite some time.
1478135913|5.0|I love Jane Austin's style and her stories, although the language takes some getting used to.  I was enthralled from the very beginning with sweet, innocent Fanny. As you read you will hate how poorly she is treated by her aunt and her cousins.  You will love how well Edmund treats her and the sweetness of their relationship.  When the Grants come things change.  In the end Fanny is seen for what she really is by her Uncle and Edmund. If you love historical fiction you will enjoy Mansfield Park.
B005PM3YII|5.0|A brilliant finale to a great story. Just when you thought you had it all worked out, twists and turns that make for a great story
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's a fun and interesting game.  The downside is that your energy gets used up rather quickly.  Use your diamonds wisely.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Excellent game. Very good graphics and engaging story line. Some of the hidden objects were a little easy,  but there were some challenging puzzles as well.  Was sorry when it ended.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|One of the best movies of the last 10 years. This is 100% worthy of Best Picture. I love this movie!
0394800184|5.0|Growing up, this was my brother's and my favorite book!  We loved the part about the Snort!  This was a gift for my nephew for Christmas.  It came in the mail quickly and in great shape.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Loved the movie. Daughter's favorite movie. Fast service and great product. Would recommend this others and this provider to others.
0062200909|5.0|Incredible detail on every topic given. High quality book construction and paper. Dense. This book could sell for double its current cost. Buy it if you appreciate art and design in film.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game. some of the hidden objects were on the easy side, but some puzzles were nice and challenging. good story line and graphics
B000W91RUG|5.0|This item arrived so fast I was totally impressed.  I am so caught up in this show I just can't get enough.  It makes me laugh out loud no matter how many times I see an episode.  Now I can watch it whenever I have the time to do so.  I am able to catch up on episodes I had missed.  I just received Season 2 yesterda and can't wait for a day off to run all of it.
B002CPMB9O|4.0|Apart from the fact that this claims to be based on a true story (very loosely), Denzel's character reminds me a lot of him in Training Day and is a real modern day gangster movie. Clever plot with Russell Crowe playing the good guy (quite convincingly), throw in a few cameos from Common and TI and you've got yourself a winner.
B00130VLZ4|1.0|This is sloppy, not form fitting and expensive.  The neoprene sleeves are 1/3rd the cost and do a better job protecting the camera.
B00139XTG4|2.0|The writer presents these principles as something NEW, when they have been around for quite awhile. The writer is also very much taken up with himself. At times the prose is out of control.<br /><br />Good topic, but disappointing treatment. Better to look to other resources for insights on applying chaos theory to holes in analytics.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I have been so pleased with this album.  Bruno Mars is a big talent and this is a buy I will enjoy for years to come!
B00BAHKQW4|5.0|RPG fans who live and die by their mobile devices rejoice! Questlord has come to revive those fleeting memories of 8-bit dungeon crawling glory, while stealing away your precious idle hours in a most enjoyable way. Questlord, designed by a one man development team, is a game that strictly adheres to the fundamentals of old school RPGing, passionately delivering fine-tuned combat, sound advancement and lots of delicious loot.<br /><br />You start by naming your character and then picking one of three races: human, dwarf or elf. Each race offers the player a particular set of strengths, weaknesses and starting gear, which caters to a specific style of play. What's really cool is that Questlord does not rigidly pigeonhole your character into a role. Yes you can choose the path of a mob-crushing warrior or eldritch tapping spell caster, but your character is more of Renaissance toon, affording you the luxury of creating a number of possible hybrids.<br /><br />For any RPG game, fluent progression is integral. Players want to witness the metamorphosis -- a transformation from squire to knight, from apprentice to mage, from underling to lord. Questlord's transition is seamless.<br /><br />The storyline is typical fluff, but still compelling enough to keep you moving forward. Along your travels across pixelated landscapes, through fortified castles and welcoming villages, you'll run into a vast assortment of quest givers eager to send you on your merry destructive way through nightmarish dungeons.<br /><br />The combat is simple to learn, yet intricate enough to keep you amused. To attack or cast spells you simply swipe or trace across your device's screen. It's basically a turn by turn system, so the focus is outlasting your enemy via attrition to gain a victory. You'll fight an abundance of foes, from necromancers to goblins to frost giants, each with different attack styles and sound sets.<br /><br />The loot is abundant and after a difficult and hard fought battle, players will marvel and gloat over newly acquired weapons, much needed potions and trinkets. Typically, this is the bread and butter of these games and Questlord offers you enough drops to keep you exploring for just a minute longer, until those minutes turn into a few hours of adventure. I highly recommend this game to any classic RPG enthusiast.yers will marvel and gloat over newly acquired weapons, much needed potions and trinkets.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|I loved this book and when I finished it in one session then I went back to read some favorite part.
B00A861QMM|3.0|I just started playing hidden object games on my Kindle fire.  I came across G5 hidden object apps a few months ago and thought I would give it a whirl since. I wear glasses and some hidden object in Epic Adventure: La Jangada were still hard to see even when I zoom in. I asked my daughter to help me find some hidden objects in this game to assure myself that it just wasn't me and she had a hard time seeing and finding them and she don't wear glasses. However the graphics are clear and colorful which makes the game still fun to play. What I didn't like about the game and why I rated it as okay because the narrator voice was different from narrated words and the objects to find were way to small.
B000TEPEJO|4.0|I love the music of the celtic women, I've watched them on television and am glad to be able to listen to their music now when ever I want. Their voices are like angels.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose a five because I could honestly relate to this book. Seeing Charlie's world through his letters was super inspiring.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so so addicting. In play it all the time!!! Sometimes I can't wait for my coin to regen!!!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|The best NEW group I've heard in years...This gal can wail baby...check it out you'll love it and want to listen to it over and over again
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series. This item was received in excellent condition and timely. I would highly recommend this video series to others.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez is our unknown Super Star.  A man of humbles beginnings who worked hard his whole life and made music from his soul.  His story and his music changed a nation.  His music will touch you heart and make you think and feel.  Look forward to more music in the future.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|This was a great deal for $1.99.  I like most of the songs.  Usually an album doesn't have enough hit songs but I've heard most of them on Slacker radio.
0316010669|5.0|I bought this book for my class but I actually really enjoyed it! It's kind of like the show Lie to Me in book form, very interesting.
1892005034|5.0|I'm co-facilitating a communication group using this book - it is excellent and teaches cooperative and loving communication skills and attitudes.<br /><br />I also love the books from the Harvard Negotiating Project including &#34;Getting to Yes,&#34; which is a wonderful classic on reaching mutually agreeable solutions, &#34;Getting Past No,&#34; which is what to do when the other person doesn't want to cooperate, and &#34;Difficult Conversations.&#34;  Also excellent are &#34;Feeling Good&#34; and the &#34;Feeling Good Handbook,&#34; most notably the sections on How to Deal with Criticism (Verbal Judo) and Dealing with Difficult People.
B00005U0HH|1.0|this dvd could only be played in over seas.not here in the good old USA. never got to watch it.
0553328255|4.0|Everything is great but the box that the books are stored in are not good quailty and it is very flimsy.
B006PTNQGU|4.0|My children like this movie and have watched it a few times. Nice family movie to watch with your family. But without a doubt kids often talk about Home Alone when they see MaCaulay Culkin.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The Minecraft Pocket Edition. 1 Word can describe it. Amazing. You choose, 1st or 3rd person. Get armour, Get Tools. Have fun. Be Creative. Try to survive. Hope you enjoy this Amazing game.<br /><br />- Helpful Reviews Inc.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app helps me sleep at home and away from home.  I love being able to choose from so many different sounds and being able to layer them.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Watched this for the first time not expecting it to live up to the originals.  I was greatly impressed with the recent movies with Downey  Jr. and Jude Law.  Having read all of the novels and short stories I was skeptical about how you could translate them to the 21 Century.  But, I must say, I was absolutely blown away.  The intrepretations of the stories was brilliant.  The heart of each character has been preserved, but with a modern bend, especially where Watson is concerned, in the books he was a veteran of Afghan wars, and sadly, so is the modern Watson.  Fiction and life repeating themselves.  The writes have nailed it right on the head and I am eagerly awating for the next installment.  &#34;The game's a-foot&#34;!!
B007R41E8O|2.0|Fun game but if you get stuck there are not enough hints to get you to the next level.  Even though most of the mind-twisters are fun and challenging if you cannot get past one you are done with the game.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great star cast, loved the acting and direction. Can't wait to see more episodes. A must see series. All the episodes are great but my favorite one is still Season 1, Episode 1
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The first book was slow paced and it took me a long time to try out the second one, and I'm so glad I did!! so my more dramatic and I couldn't put it down!! Was through it in two days, only because I had to sleep. Soo good!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a national hero,and a matter of fact unassuming guy. Any ex serviceman or woman will find this book striking familiar chords. The fact that this man died so tragically and needlessly ,after leaving the dangerous battlefields behind makes this book all the more poignant. It should be required reading for the dumb stupid politicians who constantly undermine our military and denigrate our hero's.<br />I feel that they should be taken out of the safe pampered environment of Washington and dropped in the middle of Iraq and Afghanistan ,with a rifle and a uniform. Should they survive more than 10 minutes( an extremely unlikely occurrence)  they may just get an understanding of of the meaning of courage and patriotism .<br /><br />RIP Soldier Chris  you served America well.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Im so obesessed with this whole album its not even funny.<br />Learned it all in one week. Worth every single penny.<br /><br />Spoil yourself, buy it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Some of the scenes were a little difficult to figure out, but it was fun and entertaining.  Great scene pictures.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series. My 10 year-old daughter and I are addicted!  Wonderful to watch a series without worrying about the language or explicit scenes.  Have watched all 3 seasons and can't wait for the 4th.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great way to navigate eBay on my Kindle Fire HD.  Able to enlarge item photos and further zoom to see every detail.  So convenient and easy to use.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Mitch Rapp is one of my favorites. He is a man's man and makes for easy reading. Looking for ward to.more.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|We're hooked on Dexter...this season kept us on the edge of our seats...expect the unexpected! Why subscribe to Showtime when this is really the only good show they produce?!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This story is very descriptive and vivid. Yann Martel does an amazing job with this book.  There are some errors in this digital version but they aren't serious.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|slow loading all the time and also it takes forever to go through my list of over 1000 songs. It may be a good app for someone with a few songs or albums.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|All of my coworkers read this before me and I could tell it was an awesome read because they were just glued to the book. When I bought Safe Haven for my kindle, once I started I was hooked I couldn't put it down. Nicholas Sparks has once again delivered a captivating story, love his work!
B005HSL626|4.0|Graphics are great, you can choose to play in different modes. This is a great game for the family, young and old.
0765325950|5.0|I love this series, I have read other epic fantasy and this is some of the best I have ever read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. The show is going to have a lot to live up to.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This sucks quick biscuits no bad words duck this  book Cox super<br /><br />Zjxkdjxjjxndjxjjx<br />Hi be die duck suck mom stick
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie was surprisingly funny and very off. If you are a fan of Family Guy, this humor would fit in nicely. Seems a little more tame than South Park movies. Definitely not a children's movie in my opinion, based on the language and chemical use.
B000P0J09W|4.0|He is 4 and he saw this on TV and liked it. So I orded it  that evening and it was here just<br />a few days later. Great service. Thanks
0345529057|5.0|I love this series, I have read other epic fantasy and this is some of the best I have ever read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|the best science fiction book i have read in my life. beginning is confusing, but it makes sense as the book goes on.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|I liked the movie,it was very Hollywood action packed. The quality of the video and audio was excellent and I think so far that it was worth buying amazon prime.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I sort of enjoyed it but I found the similarities to LOTR distracting.  The music for the most part is a variation on the great music in LOTR.  I was expecting a new musical score.  Thorin's character is in many ways similar to Aragorn.  And the good guy vs bad guy story (Thorin and the gray orc) is not very prevalent in the book but similar to the Aragorn/Sauron saga.  So in the end I felt disappointed.  Jackson's Hobbit movie is in many ways a repackaging of the very successful and good LOTR movies.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie was amazing, it's based on the true story of Pro Surfer Bethany Hamilton. A young teenager surfing in Hawaii who is attacked by a shark and loses her arm. This movie shows the strength, courage, will and soul of the young woman Bethany. AnnaSophia Robb's acting is impeccable! She is a very dedicated to her work and has really brought the character to life. If it weren't for her I doubt I would have watched the entire movie. Many times this movie was showing on my television and I never bothered with it, one day I had nothing to do and was tired so flicking through boring channels I came across this movie again and just left it there. To my surprise I loved the entire movie! The entire cast are incredible and dedicated they all bring something to the show. You can see the courage, dedication and the will to follow one's dreams/passions. A main play in the show is also FAITH for Bethany and her family that was faith in GOD. Faith in God played a majout role in her overcoming her obstacles. While atheists might think this doesn't apply to them, it still does. Even if you personally don't have faith in God there are many other reasons to have faith in something you strongly believe in.<br /><br />I would buy this show and I would also recommend it to others, both young and mature.<br /><br />Thumbs up for AnnaSophia Robb a young, beautiful actress who has her feet firmly planted on the ground.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli never disappoints.<br />This is another great cd. His choice of music and the fact that he sings in italian and spanish added to the enjoyment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's always up to date an always surprising every update. I love it! It's wonderful how the game is an love the items
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun and sometimes challenging, but got through the levels too quickly.  Would definitely like more levels.  I would recommend it as a quick game for short breaks
B004OXCL5Q|5.0|The item came on time. I wish I could say more but I honestly have not had the time to watch it. When I have watched it I will conclude the review.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I ordered this book, I thought it would be a bit immature, geared toward teens.  But I really liked it! (Im 50) Well written!  I just ordered the 2nd book.
030758836X|4.0|Someone once said the purpose of fiction is to evoke an emotional response. If that's true, then this is a great book. I've also heard you can judge a book by how much you think about it after you've finished it. Again, if that's true, then Gone Girl is a great book. On the other hand, if you like to be inspired or encouraged by your literature, I might suggest you avoid this one.<br /><br />They say you sell your novel with the first chapter, and you sell your next novel with the last chapter. Well, I won't be reading any more of Ms. Flynn's books. As well-written as it was (and it really was), I like to put down a novel and feel I've grown. Or at least the characters have. I didn't find that here.
B00081912E|5.0|This was a good pick. One of Jim's best works of my decision..The entire movie is just SMOKIN. LOVE IT
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I picked this up on a Gold Box deal that was one of those &#34;too good to pass up&#34; because like a lot of people I knew of Sinatra and his songs but didn't own anything by him. Trying to figure out where to start can be difficult - the compilations of Sinatra albums (along with his traditional releases) are seemingly endless. When this came along, I figured at the price I'd take a shot, and if I didn't like it, it wouldn't be too much of a loss.<br /><br />What I ended up getting was not only a great collection of Sinatra songs, but maybe a little insight in what going to a Sinatra show in Vegas was like. Sinatra opens up with some of his more mainstream songs (&#34;Come Fly With Me&#34;, &#34;I've Got You Under My Skin&#34;, &#34;Fly Me To The Moon&#34;) which, despite the &#34;live&#34; environment, still sound as familiar as traditional recordings. After &#34;Fly Me To The Moon&#34;, the orchestra (led by the legendary Count Basie) plays a little instrumental as Sinatra takes a sort of intermission. What follows is a nearly 12 minute monologue of Sinatra being &#34;Sinatra&#34; - talking about his dad, Dean Martin, and just opening up to his audience. Sinatra has a charm and charisma during this segment that makes it easy to understand how he was able to cross over into a film career.<br /><br />Many fans hate suggesting &#34;greatest hits&#34; albums to newbies because a collection of songs that were popular to the mainstream doesn't necessarily give you a good picture of the performer. This album takes care of that issue - giving the listener enough mainstream/familiar songs to draw them in, while still giving the listener the actual Sinatra &#34;experience&#34;. Highly recommended, especially for those looking for their first Sinatra album.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|At times very heart rendering and sad, other times very funny, A very different type of novel in that there is humor,sadness and suspense.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|All the above reviews of Justin's new CD are well thought out. I would add a slight bit of criticism. After an almost 17 year period of time I would have expected Justin to offer fans maybe 14 or so new songs. To include &#34;It's Cold Outside Of Your Heart&#34;, a Moodies song from 1983 and &#34;Broken Dreams&#34; from his last solo effort seems out of place. I would have liked to have seen these selections and the dance club remakes of &#34;I Know You're Out There Somewhere&#34;, a 1988 Moodies hit as &#34;bonus tracks&#34; following the main album. I'm a bit perplexed by some of Justin's choices. However, I do find some of the new songs good, some great and a couple excellent. It's looking more and more like we'll never see a new Moody Blues album. Both Justin and Graeme Edge have said that no record companies seem interested in releasing a new MB record. So, I hope it's not another 17 years before Justin's next collection of songs. He'll be 83 then. Not too many 83 year old singer/songwriters recording these days.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|thrift shop is so funny. good lyrics to many of the other songs.  Not just about who he is sleeping with.
B00005NUZO|5.0|This special edition of Michael Jackson's BAD album is great, sounds great. It brought back great memories of this artist's true talents.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is pretty much Temple Run with a different location and graphics. Really good and 4 star. Recommended highly for all game lovers.
1439102813|2.0|We have been dealing with Alzheimer's disease in a close relative for three years now; she was officially diagnosed last summer. If there is one hallmark of this disease, in our experience, it is denial, denial, denial. I read this book, desperate for insight into her failing mind, and what I found in the book was nothing that matched our reality. There is no rational thought or discussion in someone with Alzheimer's. That ability has been lost, even as outward appearances suggest otherwise. There is a self-realization and acceptance in Alice that I'm not sure is found in real life. It would be so much easier if that was the case. Even if one has a \\"breakthrough\\" conversation with someone with Alzheimer's, it is forgotten overnight. The reality of Alzheimer's is so much more frustrating than this book conveys, because the person experiencing it has such a skewed version of reality, one that clings desperately to the notion that all is just fine. I was hoping for so much more in this book. I was disappointed.
0765325950|5.0|really good conclusion to a really long series... final chapter is rushed , but to be expected...great job brandon.<br />randy ice

B005GFPZYK|5.0|We have a lot to thank Chris and his team for the bravery that they showed serving their country. We are truly saddened to learn of the tradegy that befell Chris after returning home.

0545123267|4.0|This is the first book in a series of 3 ( so far) called The Wolves of Mercy Falls Series.  It explores the special bond between between Grace and a mysterious young man to whoms he is inexplicably drawn  and who she is certain must be the wolf who saved her life years ago when she was just a girl.  Like The Twilight Books, The  Wolves of Mercy Falls books have their own rules about werewolves that differ greatly from Monster movies & folklore.  These rules help define the world that both Grace and Sam, the man she realizes she is in love with, are living and greatly impact their potential for a future together. Some reviewers have just laid out all the rules but I don't want to do that.  It would ruin the tension that builds as each new factor comes into play, threatening to seperate the lovers forever.<br /><br />This is a strong first book in a series and it sets out the parameters of their shared world well enough for the reader to accept these new facts and to just run with them in service of the story.  The tale is told from both Grace and Sam's point of view and like the Twilight books, a lot is conveyed through nonverbal clues.  Set in Minnesota, the landscape as well as the harsh winters there, become very much a part of the story, almost a character itself.  If you like books that linger on evocatative description and keep you tantalized with  the simmering passions running under the surface of the story unfolding, then you will enjoy this series very much indeed!<br /><br />Over the course of the three books there are huge changes in store for Grace and Sam.  This first book begins their love story and theirs is a story you will likely want to see through to the end.  There is peril, an expanding cast of characters, bigger and more dangerious challenges to face, and it all winds up, some say, in an open-ended manner which could mean more books in the series.<br /><br />If you are a \\"Twihard\\" looking for a new series, then this may be just what the doctor ordered.  I feel the writing is a bit more skilled and evocative but it is very PG13.  Remember, this is a book amained at readers aged 14 years and up.  I'm glad to see writers still telling \\"paranormal romance\\" stories without getting all down in the dirt and disgusting.  Be aware, if you read the one, you will likely want to read the next two, which are thankfully already published and ready for your consumption!ordered.

B00BEZTMWW|1.0|That about sums up the movie - very disappointing. Didn't follow the book very much and most of the movie consists of the group running....then running again....and again.<br />The scenes are along the same lines of The Lord Of The Rings and yes it looks cool but as far as content it was a long bunch of nothing. And there are 2 more movies still to sit through - ugh.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The music and singing are so good.  Takes me right back to the movie.  I can listen to it over and over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|misteltoe is my horse. she is a very great horse to have. I think that you will love the app also.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|The trailers for this movie convinced me that I was going to like it.  I did enjoy the music, but the story line was Revenge of the Nerds without being as funny as ROTN.  Kids may like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. You can easily get sucked in and play for hours. Lots of different power ups and missions. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is awesome, the way each character run and jumps are different, the thropies make you go wow thats niceI like the jetpack cool flying above. But when you put a huge score on the board you sure be able to save your score and the number of coins that are there, also you should be able to keep the characters that brought with the coins.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Heart-wrenching, a moving story well told.  Thank you, Colleene Hoover!  I can,t wait to read and absorb her next book!!
B00005TQKQ|3.0|I was most impressed with how soon I received my order.  It did the job of cleaning my camcorder and it was easy to use.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|-Its simple (i.e- you can just about open the book anywhere and &#34;start&#34; something<br />-Its fun (i.e- there are things that you would not have found or researched yourself but will be glad Timothy did)<br />-Even if you dont ever cook anything its fun to read (i.e- you learn so much about food, cooking, chef-life, kitchen terminology)<br />-Timothy Ferris has little life hacks that can be used across any other activities you do (i.e- folding a tshirt in two seconds)<br />- this is learning 2.0<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />the kicker: if the book was 150-200 dollars i might have to think a bit harder to say YES but for 10 bucks on Kindle? a no brainer...
0345803485|4.0|The love story unfolds in an unusual direction and the physical side of the story surely stretches boundaries. Interesting read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This riveting showcase is absorbing from the beginning. In my opinion not a waist of time like some of the reality shows. The acting is some of the best I have seen in a very long time. Thank you for allowing those of us on the wrong side of the pond to see it. Ha! Ha!
B00881VLCE|5.0|For all those patients who want there kids to stay focused and not get into anything then download this app because it makes you think and work hard and pushes you to push your self and helps keep you focused about of trouble
B0063IH60K|5.0|i have always liked solitare  wether it be cards on computer now on the kindle very fun to play anytime
B009E3EXMU|4.0|Very good packaging. Excellent keepsake of the concert. Excellent DVD. Camera work could have been better. My biggest gripe is that Jimmy's tone sounds good, but a little overly &#34;digital.&#34;
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read from the experience on the ground - shows all the Washington / Political spin of the mission for what it is/was.  Was like I had clear pictures of the Seal experience as I was reading .. Like I was there.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I are greatly enjoying everything about Downton Abbey. We enjoy period pieces anyway but this one seems particularly accurate. Of course, the setting and costumes are beautiful and the interaction between the classes, upstairs and downstairs, is eyeopening. The plot is, on the whole, light but there is a vaguely ominous undercurrent that, after the Great War, things will be changing dramatically and inexorably and the life, and life style, enjoyed by the family in and around Downton Abbey will never again be what it was. Or even what it is in the series.
B0095P29EG|4.0|I thought the movie looked great on my kindle fire HD. Clear picture and sound was perfect! Love the movies that are free for prime membership.
B00A757EFW|5.0|i have always liked pacman it never gets to boring or u never get to old to play the pacman
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Buy it now and wear it out. Great sound quality, musicianship, and representation of their live shows (which are unbelievable!).
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I play piano for my church and I write a few of my own songs. This app is awesome. You can actually play more than one note at a time. It is great for writing music for a new song. I haven't used the games much .... YET, but I will get to that. I'm sure my 7 grandchildren will also find it to be lots of fun. Thank you for offering this for FREE!!! I am on Disability and on a tight fixed income. This is such a blessing.
B001SKB1Y0|3.0|Woody Allen makes engaging and fanciful movies. This is one of them. The script crackles and, in addition, there is a narrator to be the omniscient observer of what we cannot see or hear. Suspension of disbelief is necessary and I found myself wondering what these people did in life to be able to live like they did. But, then again, that's a reason in itself to go to fantasy movies. The movie also made me wish we had visited Barcelona when we were in Spain. Truly a beautiful place.
B00B3MN65K|4.0|Josh is all that and more.  Well arranged and produced with great song selections.  Oh, and that voice just keeps getting better and better.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|this story was fun and ended in a good way glad he would not let her go to make her see they were meant for eachother
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|There is a reason this album won so many awards! This group gets better every time they play. Stellar album.
B004LROUNG|5.0|i could not put this book down.  i had not read one of his books for awhile but needed something to read.  i sent it to my kindle and then could not close it.  can't wait to read the next one.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Cant say anything negative about it! Absolutely love the show! Between this show and Duck Dynasty, it is one of the few shows on TV that you can actually watch as a family
B001P1MZNI|4.0|Impossible to imagine a better setting than the Sands in Vegas.  The band is tight and Frank is loose.  Overall, best hits by a singer at the top of his game with the best back up band one could imagine.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Most touching and influential book I have ever read. My all-time favorite....I saw the movie which led me to read the book.
B007IV1E2W|5.0|What spectacular storytelling.  The season starts right off with The Doctor getting killed and River, Rory, and Amy burning his body.  From there it goes into the events leading up to his death, including the reveal of the identity of River Song.  Moffat has taken over the reigns from RTD the season before this, and you can go back and watch those episodes again and easily see that this was a two-season story arc that he had in mind all along.  Absolutely brilliant.
1451695195|4.0|A bit hard to read but the message was one of reassurance.<br />And from a credible doctor, that was a good thing.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I saw his story on Waiting for Sugarman and decided to buy his albums. His songs tell stories and speak out on social themes.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like this app it gets me up in the morning it wakes me up for school it is a good app i want  you to get it
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Amazing, honestly the absolute best book I have ever read. It will hook you and you won't be able to stop reading.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the story from start to finish.  It is a  story about a second chance at love.  The two main characters, Alex and Katie are incredibly likeable. She is a girl with a troubled past trying to escape.  She meets Alex in a new town and falls for him, but at the same time she wants to protect him from her secret.  Alex's patience and understanding toward Katie is amazing.  It's not like your usual romantic type story.  There is also suspense, which I liked.  The only regret that I had was that is ended too soon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its a good game for when you are bored and have nothing to do. it lasts you a long time before you beat it.<br />i would tottly recoment this game.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Saw his story on Waiting for Sugarman and decided to buy his albums. His songs tell stories and speak out on social themes.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|There are several versions. This one - for the same price- includes the Christmas episode. The others don't include that, and you need that episode. Great quality of this new classic!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. I'm 12 and I've had it for a while and I never get tired of it. Sometimes it glitches but it's only because I have a lot of things of my kindle. There are really no problems with it and the graphics are awesome. I recommend this game because it's fun and never gets boring. Absolutely great. GET IT NOW!!!!
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I've had them for a while now and re-watch them occasionally.  I love 'em!  The wife hates 'em!  Enough said!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am so hooked on this series.  One of the best I have watched.  Love all the characters, and the actors who portray them.  Love it. Love it. Love it
0670023329|4.0|Not enough on camp life and too much on his integration into western society but eye opening stuff on how this government controls its citizens
B009WJ44KC|5.0|This is an inspirational, amazing soundtrack! Another wonderful score by John Williams. The movie was marvellous and so is the soundtrack. LOVE IT!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a fun game but I want to update it but I don't know how to but it's still fun
B005F3XV62|4.0|Not Kevins best, but the family likes it very well.  Good addition to the library, but it's not a Paul Blart Mall Cop!
B007JMW46U|5.0|I have been re-reading the whole Holmes canon and this is the third installment.  While I enjoyed A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four very much, I feel that this is where Doyle really got a handle on these characters and the way to tell these stories.  It may well be that Holmes and Watson are better suited to the short story format than the novel/novella format.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of very different stories, ranging from a rather light hearted jilted lover mystery that introduces Holmes to one of the few people to ever best him, to a dark and deadly entanglement with the KKK in which Holmes can be said to cross a line by threatening his adversary with death.  What happens?  Read the stories.  They are fantastic.  Every one of them clever and varied and every one with a master's touch.<br /><br />I also must praise this edition.  If you are going to e-read this then get the Top 5 edition.  It is very well done with lots of original illustrations that made the stories even more fun to read.  If buying a stand alone e-book, I would get no other edition.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|using it , i worked with better but none are offline as is my most important option , a must have
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book. It is one of my favorites from Jodi Picoult. It is more than a romance novel!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was really a great movie, though you may want to run the kids off.  It has some pretty strong &#34;adult&#34; conversations at times.  The wife loved it and I have to admit I thought it was very good as well.  It really gives you a different perspective about segregation during that era.  It was humorous at times, and sad at times, overall a really well done movie.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The Rosie Project was light and funny, I couldn't put it down.<br />I am now on a quest to find something just as good, wish me luck.<br />Best book award by KB

B005G4TJUC|4.0|Plenty of action and almost lives up to the others in the franchise. However, not to be missed or overlooked as one of the btter robot wars themed movies.
0425263908|5.0|This book kept me turning pages and reading more.  Can't wait for the final installment of this series, Entwined with You.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|This is one of my most favorites of John Wayne westerns.  Just a really good movie.  A lot better than Rio Bravo.  All the characters have just the right people playing them.
B000001ESP|5.0|I bought this CD for my son, who loves Rush. A week after giving it to him, I called to find out what he thought of it.  He said it is great and he is enjoying it very much.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I think this is one of the best series done for TV. Witty dilogue, believable scenario, and genuine interplay between all characters.

B005LAII80|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />I've never read the Dredd comics or seen the Stallone flick; I've only played the Dredd pinball (pretty good machine). So I came into this film cold, and was definitely blown away, visually more than anything else. The \\"Slow-Mo\\" drug sequences are some of the most colorfully astonishing scenes I've ever witnessed in a film. The extras (40 minutes on the blu-ray including a nice bit on the killer visual effects) point out that these are due to a new kind of super slo-mo camera, and boy does it work. They also clearly added CGI to those shots, and the sparkling rainbow of colors is amazing.<br /><br />I watched this on a big LED on blu-ray, and the image quality is near-perfect, some of the best I've ever seen. I can only imagine how intense it was in 3D Imax. Wow. But as blu-rays go, this is state of the art, up there with The Dark Knight and Up and Baraka for picture definition.<br /><br />Yet movies do not live by effects alone, and it helps that Dredd tells a good story, however grim. The acting is solid, the script rough but wry, and all in all it's a real roller coaster ride, punctuated by those truly mind-blowing slo-mo scenes. If you like good sci-fi, this is an excellent dystopian futurist vision, though very violent, so be forewarned. Not for the squeamish.<br /><br />It's clear the filmmakers are big fans of many sci-fi classics, as there are elements of and sly nods to memorable flicks like Escape From New York, Blade Runner, Matrix, Robocop, Road Warrior, Aliens, Total Recall and a host of others. If you like those films there will be plenty for you to enjoy here.<br /><br />By the way, I look forward to seeing these new slo-mo cams used for nature films. Should be incredible.<br /><br />PS The Slow-Mo drug slows thoughts by 100 times, which when you think about it is pretty incredible. I think anybody would end up taking that, right? Makes your life last that much longer, hard to resist. It made me think of that scene in Inception where the people are all hooked up together and sharing the dream world that's 12 times slower than life. Then of course each new level is 12 times slower, so four levels is 12 to the fourth power. Which is mighty slow! All of which leads me to wonder: what would be the \\"perfect\\" slow-down speed for a drug/biofeedback machine/etc?<br /><br />I'd be interested to know what people think. As we enter the cyber age ever more fully, one can't help but think we're slowly leaving our bodies and letting our minds float free in the ether. Will slowing our brains down be the end goal of that? Seems to be the opposite right now, in any case.<br /><br />One thing for sure: this film made me think about many things. And that's a good thing in my books.ere the people are all hooked up together and sharing the dream world that's 12 times slower than life.

B002M87V0A|1.0|Good film movie (because I have seen it before). Got the Blue Ray in the mail but it didn't work! I had people over to watch the film too :-) PLAN B- I rented it from Amazon for basically $3 but the quality of it was bad (I guess you need a kindle to download and not stream it) - Amazon has FAILED ME TWICE -WHY!!!  Don't buy the Blue RAY FROM AMAZON!!! Try renting it from You Tube - not sure how that works but they have it cheaper and probably better quality. Stick to books Amazon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great challenge for everyone. a fun way to keep the brain and motor skills fine tuned. a sure hit for everyone in your family<br /><br /> !
B001P1MZNI|4.0|I don't really like the talking parts.  That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.  Great album, otherwise.  A classic!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season of the Walking Dead yet!  A whole lot of zombie killin action!  A definite must watch series for action and suspense!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Could be the best book of the 3, Book 2 was a let down, but book 3 was right up there with book 1 and may be even a little bit better.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|I'm an audiophile of sorts (at least as much of one as you can be on a budget).  So I'm long past the point of just jamming speaker wire into a terminal.  Banana plugs are the way to go for me and these are excellent.  I swear by them because they make removing and re-connecting speaker wire so much easier.  Often it is difficult to get behind your amp or receiver to do this sort of work so having a plug takes the hassle out of it.  Use them and you will be glad you did.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I bought this for mom for christmas.. I had seen this before myself , i thought it was beautiful! So i wanted her to have a copy.It brought tears to her eyes, she really enjoyed it. I bought a copy for myself the next day.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie what the cuss is wrong with you?! Kids enjoy it because its fun. Adults love it for it's sheer brilliance.
B003VW54QO|5.0|If you cut out most of the Angie Dickinson scenes, this is the best man's movie ever. Rio Bravo is more like Rio Bravado. Each of the main characters displays a manly grit and virtue lost in this estrogen soaked society. Great performances all around, set under infinite blue skies make this a visual treat.<br /><br />Pay attention to the opening: almost 5 minutes without a line of dialogue builds suspense for the Duke's opening line: alright Joe, you're coming with me.<br /><br />My favorite western by far!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the series.  Written very well and I loved the premise.  Characters were well developed and the pace engaging.
B000WT7R6O|4.0|The guys are cute, the situations hairy, and close friends and foes always near by. I really like the weird takes on the supernatural in Supernatural.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Really just more of the same story, but a story I like.  Still, I think I'm finished with this series now.  Liked all of the actors in the movie & it was well done & fast paced.  An enjoyable film.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I haven't tried to do anything complicated with this calculator; I use it for very simple calculations, like keeping track of grocery store spending, etc.  I CAN say, however, that it has an attractive interface, it works well, and it's VERY handy to have in my Kindle Fire HD!  Definitely recommended!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is an action packed must-see movie. It draws you in from the beginning to the end. For not miss this one!
B000W5PIYQ|4.0|This was a great season. CSI: Las Vegas, the original is best and that is all it takes for me.
B00BESM14U|3.0|The acting was fin & the characters were sweet but it just seemed to be so blatantly earnest I almost couldn't take it.  I guess I'm just too old to appreciate the angsty-ness of young adults anymore.

B000V5Y1SQ|2.0|I was/am a huge Star trek Fan. I've watched the TOS, TNG, STVOG, the last pre-federation star trek and all the movies as well. Only one missed out was DS9 and since it was Prime Free on Amazon, I thought I'd give it a try. Boy was I disappointed by the first season. The stories were boring, the characters uninteresting and it moved at a numbingly slow pace.  It even lacks the current social/cultural topics/controversies that some of the others , especially TNG, incorporated into their stories, that made them a reflection of our current times.( well perhaps politically it was a mirror of its present, with the cold war ending, leaving a power vacuum for smaller powers and/or setting of the sun on the British Empire and how it related to its former colonies)<br /><br />I'm still gonna watch all the seasons, for the sake of watching the Star trek Universe(will never give up on anything Star Trek completely), but so far its far from enjoyable.<br /><br />P.S. I've heard that in the later seasons it picks up, with multi-season long story arcs about Dominion, more character development and such, We'll see........
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever seen!  Not for the faint-of-heart but soooo addictive.  Once you start watching, you will consume the whole series like popcorn.  Great acting, great story, don't miss it!
B00318CV28|5.0|This movie is spectacular, funny for all ages. The only thing that was mildly disappointing was that it turned out to be a European copy and my DVD player refused to play it. I can only watch it on my laptop, which is inconvenient but I'm keeping it because it's too much of a hassle to return it.
B0076I624W|5.0|All these years and I had never seen Meet Joe Black all the way through! If you look online, you'll find polarized positions on this movie.  I'm not going to try to change those one way or the other. This movie has some good acting and some great acting (Sir Anthony); but what I like most is the underlying message.  Here is the end of the road for a decent man (Hopkins), who wakes up every morning wanting nothing more.  I don't care who you are or what your station in life, to wake every morning with the attitude that you will be satisfied with the day is a wonderful thing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the fact that Amazon has this show! I don't have cable so can't watch it on the tv.. thank you Amazon!!
1603425381|5.0|This is an awesome book for any border you want to add to your item!! Thanks for the speedy delivery too!!  Everything arrived in great condition in the shipment!!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|although saw the series on PBS, we assumed, and correctly so, that we missed a lot of things so needed to go back and watch dvd for clarification.  Did the same thing with seasons 1 and 2.  Recommend all Downton followers to do the same thing.  Blue Ray quality as good or  better than original on HDTV.
0316017930|5.0|I found this book to be fascinating and it made me think, and ultimately change my philosophy of the relationship of brilliance to success. Using a variety of subjects, Gladwell poses his theories relative to the opportunities presented, hours experienced and mental capabilities of some of our well known success stories.  I found out some things I didn't know and came to understand some things that I knew - but had never assembled and reviewed in this manner. I love books about &#34;people&#34; - their experiences, attempts, failures and successes - so I found this book very interesting and have purchased multiple copies for my friends and acquaintances - such as this one. You may be challenged and you may not agree with all of Gladwell's conclusions - I didn't - but I think you would be hard pressed to read this book without smiling occasionly saying, &#34;I never knew that&#34; and perhaps even changing the way you look at and approach success in life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm halfway through this book and really love it - everyone who has read it recommended it so I finally got it.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. Stephen King is one of my favorite authors. I found this book to be intriguing and captivating in a totally new and different style. I couldn't put it down.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|An entertaining read from beginning to end. Its one of those books  you have to finish before picking up anything else to read.
1401322786|3.0|I enjoyed this book from Mitch Albom, but it is very, very different from his other books in several respects.  First, it is purely fiction (perhaps with a message - but fiction nonetheless).  The other books from him that I've enjoyed (Have a Little Faith & Tuesdays with Morrie) have been based on true stories.  This book is written from the perspective of (at least) three different people in a variety of time periods.  It's more of a &#34;message&#34; book than one to be believable in my opinion.  It's not bad - but if you've never read this author, you should try one of those listed above or &#34;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&#34; first.
B0014DQSG2|5.0|Daughter whose never met dad, because both her parents were lied to by the same (son of a female cur) runs off to England to chat him up. Yeah that's original, not. Girl meets boy and like mom walks away by helping dad win his all important election. Yeah, I think not, again. Mean stepmother to be locks stepdaughter to be in a storage room, not. Dad gives up .(political) endeavors because he has something/one he loves more than (gain,above).<br /><br />  So, what works? The way they put it all together. When we hear it from the girl herself as she tells 'evil stepsister' don't you get it Cinderella always wins.  Darn if it doesn't work. That's why I'm buying a copy for my granddaughter. This is a cute, sweet movie
B004UFEJXK|5.0|As a movie Wall-E operates on several levels -- in the background, a commentary on humankind's misuse/neglect of its the world we live in and the role of the modern corporation in fostering that very neglect -- and in the foreground, front and center, the resilience of the human spirit and our ability, collectively and individually, to learn and to change for the better.  Above all, Wall-E is a beautiful love story, a classic tale of mismatched lovers.<br /><br />Wall-E himself is an introvert, a hopeless romantic, a learner, an inventor, and one who knows how to take care of himself.  That he is also a robot, a machine only makes his character all the more poignant and attractive.  He is the humble soul who plugs away at his job and yet aspires to do and be something more.<br /><br />In Eve, we find a modern, decisive, driven (her &#34;directive&#34; is initially all-consuming) powerful (she packs serious heat), elegant woman who can nonetheless fall for the charms of her goofy, unglamorous love interest.  Here is the classic mismatched couple celebrated time and again in literature and movies -- from Cyrano de Bergerac to Star Wars.<br /><br />The movie itself is a series of wonderful gifts beyond these two main characters and their love story -- the amazing animation, with sweeping vistas of neglected earthbound cities, dancing in the sky, rogue robots clattering through spaceship corridors, the heroic delivery of one small plant growing in an old boot -- as well as the many smaller vignettes in the lives of other characters who gradually discover who they are and who they can be.<br /><br />This version of the movie, in high definition, only takes the story and the characters and the animation to a higher and more rewarding level.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that it is a lot more fun than the frist one and it is easy it also has better graphics yup will not regret Bering this game it should cost money
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works well with all Kindle models, either as a computer cord or charging cord. My original Kindle came with a charger and cord.  The new editions don't.  They come with a cord like this - but my mom's got thrown away with the box.  This is a perfect replacement.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This was such a good pilot!  Now I am watching the current shows and this gave me the background to know what the story is about!  I hope to be able to see the other seasons at some time.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Escrito de forma simples e direta, concentra muita informação sobre um tema delicado: nossa saúde, e não nosso peso. Como médico me impressionei com a quantidade de dados incluídos, mas tenho certeza que qualquer um pode entende-los.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|a few of the &#34;Hits&#34; I somehow missed...but overall vintage full band sound with Collins great lyrics.  Always a great production and sound.
0553801473|5.0|I completely enjoyed this newest book by George Martin.  It was a total page turner and I was sad when it ended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fave. Book, ever!<br />I also luv da Percy Jackson and heroes of Olympus and Kane Chronicles! :) :) :) :)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Brilliant use of a diary format to describe an astronauts experiences of being stranded on Mars. Great use of colloquial and nice tension.<br /><br />A page turner!
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Music is great but some lyrics were unacceptable to me.  I guess that's the &#34;new&#34; artistic freedom.  What I could accept was very well written; great harmony
B009G78EE2|4.0|It's different, and very good. I didn't have an issue with the swear words. With the song other side was on sale
B005HED08I|3.0|sound dropped to a whisper then back to normal over and over in some of the episodes.  the early trek episodes were a little rough.  keep watching.  it gets better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The characters were both so strong even though it was only spoken through Sky's point of view. It also had the right amount of drama without so much of the petty drama that drags out a book and makes you want to skip chapters to get to the point. It worked up to the disaster beautifully and ended with a piece of mind. I like twists in books but I also like happy endings too so it had just the right amount of both. I would HIGHLY recommend this book... It has made it to my personal top 10.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I picked this novel up on the recommendations of my older brother, and finished it not 2 days later. He sold it to me thus, and, to avoid spoilers, I'll paraphrase him: &#34;a geeky young programmer in San Francisco loses his job and picks up a gig working the night shift at a 24-hour bookstore. And then...things...become...strange.&#34;<br />This book is simply amazing. It is perfectly tailored to the 20-30-40-really-anyone-who-misses-some-aspect-of-days-gone-by crowd. The novel does an amazing job of tying in archetypes (the wise teacher/wizard, the bumbling hero/nerd, the brilliant femme fatale/love interest, the power-hungry nemesis, the best friend oh-so-reminiscent of Han Solo), and then turning them on its head (these parts I won't go into, because I'm not an evil monster who delights in spoiling wonderful books for others). Despite the seemingly innocuous beginning, this book offers suspense on suspense on twists on turns, and it had me gasping for air at the conclusion.<br />A wonderful read that puts literature, love, technology, and friendships forged over 16-year-olds playing Dungeons and Dragons (admit it, you have them), into perspective.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Reads like a series of short stories.<br />Not much that digs into the emotions of the reader. Could put down and return later to continue reading.
B00A7C9EVM|5.0|Very nice to get so many of them in the same bundle.<br />It's a great read and will keep me busy for long.<br /><br />I haven't read them in over 10 years so really looking forward to reading them again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham's style.  It's an easy read and keeps you wanting more.  His stories are easy to follow and keeps you guessing.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|If you enjoy this type of music this is a great classic that come out clear in the mp3 format
B009JBZH54|5.0|Been waiting for this Trilogy to come out..finally did..and i don't regret waiting for it...Highly recommend it for anyone who is an avid movie buff.
B007HO392S|5.0|I am not a big fan of country music. However, Carrie Underwood has a beautiful voice.<br />There are several good songs and one that is exceptional in my opinion. &#34;See You Again&#34;, the fourth song is by far my favorite.<br />&#34;Blown Away&#34; is also good and the reason I decided to make this purchase. Glad that I did.
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|So amazing! It was as if I had been taken back in time to re-live time there. Affleck directed this with a majic wand.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great acting, great stories.  Love it!  Can't wait until Season 4.  Sorry they killed off Matthew, but I've heard a new love interest for Lady Mary appears.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I've just begun to like Bruno Mars and this album has some good songs on it.  Love having the MP3 version, because I can listen to it on all my devices, phone, tablet, etc...
B0028RXXFC|4.0|If you like historical drama, then you will probably like this show. There is violence and nudity so definitely not<br />for the family. Considering it is 2 full seasons I think it is a good value.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|It's sinatra and count basie, of course it's good. And the sound quality is great for a recording from that time frame.
B002BCNK1Q|4.0|waited awhile to see this moview always have been a clint fan but this kind of shows a soft side  of the tough man
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun to play occupys my children for hours. I just started to play when my kids were asleep.I am trupble putting the game down.
0470901071|5.0|This is a most excellent resource, if you ever plan to take the CCNA. The classes gave me then information I needed, but the book gave me the ability to actually PASS the exam....
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I love the new way that they improved the series . . . . . .. . . . .
0375413405|3.0|it sure does have alot of receipes some seem to be alittle involved but it is a french cookbook, it became to be very hel[pful so we could try some french cooking before my daughter took her trip to france
B005GYGCOI|3.0|It's great to have the superb information that Lonely Planet provides, but unfortunately it's too difficult to navigate the book easily on the kindle and you find yourself getting lost (whilst you're actually lost) trying to find what you actually want.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|First, I have no taste. I have been told this for years. I love this movie. I've watched it a couple of times since I got it. The action is well done, the humor is most excellent, and the acting is perfect. The special effects are what you'd expect out of a much larger budget movie, and the story is great.<br /><br />No, don't go in to this expecting &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;. Instead, expect &#34;Tremors&#34;, &#34;Wild Zero&#34;, &#34;Rocky Horror&#34; (3 of my favorite movies....). It's funny, it's action packed, It's fun to watch!
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|One of the BEST for $1.99 Deal of the Day? In their way they were as innovative as The Beatles.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun! It's going to win any awards but it's a super enjoyable Friday night movie!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This has been magnificent!  The cast is superb!  The episodes are enthralling!  But we must now wait 10 MONTHS to see it again!  I've never been so thrilled and dedicated to a TV series and now wait anxiously for Sunday evenings.  This may be wishful thinking but I hope it doesn't end for years and years and years.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|This didn't work on our device. We tried several times to get this to open and work with no luck whatsoever.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|It was so great to watch the entire series without having to go back and try to remember what happened
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed did an awesome job! I have listened to his CD about ten times since i bought it! I cant get enough!
055380684X|5.0|If you have ever wondered why the Brazilians are the best soccer players, why the Dominicans are the best at baseball, why the South Korean women are the best golfers, why there are &#34;hot beds&#34; of talent in certain places in the world, this book will answer the questions. I am a golf coach and I teach. I learned a lot about how people learn and how the best teachers teach. I thought the book was outstanding and recommend it highly.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham has done it again.  There are so many twists and turns to the main characters actions that it is hard to stop<br />reading for fear you might lose the train of the story!  The main character is smart in the unorthrodox schemes he devises.<br />If you like John Grisham, you will probably like this book.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|No doubt a risky venture in reality, but this split second drama is too Hollywood.  Did trucks full of Iranian goons really chase the plane down the runway?  C'mon.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|we have the first part and pre ordred the second part good movie it cam quicker than I though it would
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Being a behavioral mental health counselor, I'm always interested in this type of information. This book explains, in great detail, how we develop our habits and the power of them. I recommend the book if you are into this type of information.
B00849F82E|4.0|This book has some great stuff in it.  Chesterton takes a wonderfully road through personal experience theology and philosophy to explain God, the human condition and how they intersect.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved this book! It's one of those books you could read in a day! Very well written. I Love reading books that speak the truth!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|It wasn't what I expected at all.  I played about three of the games and then I deleted it from my device and cloud.  Wasn't bad, just not what I expected.
B008CP6RWU|2.0|I have to admit that the game is very well made, but taking into account that I paid 30 usd for this game, it is mostly a great deception. You have to be either a hipster or stoned to think its the best game of the year. Yes it is interesting, great soundtrack and a new concept, but that doesn't make it a good game.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Great movie.. kids loved it and the wife was nervous throughout the whole movie. Will see again soon. Recommend to all who like this Genre.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Many people have praised these books and than knocked the last one.let me say this, if you've ever served overseas and seen starving hungry children, abused people ,you will understand .these three books are amazing and should be compulsive reading,to ensure we never follow a path so destructive . I congratulate. Praise and feel for mrs Collins ,whom has achieved such a work of art. For skeptics I say this .life is horrible in some places in this world , enjoy what you have . Or some day you may have the hunger games. Peter taylor , Maine
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm not one that is big on card games, but this one is really good.  I like that it has several levels of play to choose from.  It can be addictive as well.  Its a great app to have if you are somewhere and get bored!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was by far the best 3D to date, until...Titanic, this director/producer really knows how to make a good immersible story/3D.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This may date to the 1980's but it tells the tale of youth struggling for identity in a world of expectations and convenient misunderstandings. It is accessible yet provocative. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.
B009CPES4I|5.0|What's not to like?  Superlative acting, a wonderful story, a delightful setting and just the right balance between realism and humor.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great and very useful app.  I was on a business trip and in the room, the phone was on one side of the bed and the alarm clock on the other.  I had to unplug the alarm clock to charge my phone.  I was thinking...hmmm....I wonder if kindle has an alarm clock app.  Well, this is definitely the one to get.  It has some great settings to choose from.  You can even customize the color!  There are well over 20 tones to choose from to be awaken by, not to mention the snooze settings.  It even works when your kindle is in sleep mode!
B006H5120E|5.0|This is by far the best 3D out there, was very impressive, i think even better than Avatar! SO BUY!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book.  So creative.  I want to go to the circus if it could be like this one.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|The acting is superlative.  The story-telling is straightforward, not preachy.  I haven't cried at a movie in a long time, but this really moved me.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I got this as the free app of the day and let me just say that it was a pretty good game.  I really enjoyed it.  It is a bit addictive.  However, once you solve the mystery, the game is not very useless unless you want to play it again.
B003B02O14|5.0|Grisham always writes and exciting novel! Great from the beginning to the end! Keeps you guessing how Grisham is going to end the book.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Our family of six really enjoyed this movie.  Great production; very well done.  My daughter and husband love the book even more.
B004JMY312|5.0|I always enjoy watching this movie, especially around Halloween. This is a must have for anyone to watch around Halloween time.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Great movie. Good focus on how alcohol can affect your life.  Excellent acting by Denzel Washington.  Good drama movie.  I rate it 5 stars
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Theodore is a very interesting hero! I look forward to more of these Kid Lawyer novels. Theodore doesn't need to grow up.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book itself was in good quality. It arrived faster than expected.<br />The story was good but a bit disappointing how it ended.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the better books I've read in quite some time.  Well written, believable 3D characters.  Kudos to the author !
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is a great new artist. I don't think there is a bad song on this album. Looking forward to his tour this summer. : )
B002V6RB1C|2.0|What is all the fuss here? There must be something else to this movie because my wife and I were very much wondering what the plot was about for the first hour and the second hour seemed like a glorification of stubbornness to the point of stupidity.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I thought this film was astounding. Yes, there are minor problems but props to Jackson and Co for being so faithful to the source material, while incorporating material from the appendices. It was delightful!
B00000IQMT|4.0|It helps to have for that special time and momeries with friends<br /><br />we'll recommend it to other.<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Kiddy Hamman
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Reading this book has been a pleasure and an experience. The main character is one of those lost souls you want to help find the way but you're only able to watch them walk around in lonely circles. The rest of the ensemble of full of a variety of personalities all of which we can relate to. I wish I had more Patricks in my life haha
0060245867|5.0|Another one of my daughters favorite books, so we bought this one as a gift for another child. the book was in great condition, thank you.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I am a politics junkie. I watched few episodes on youtube and baught it. Saved almost 100 bucks on this deal. It was new and came in nice package.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|like it but had to return it for a full refund<br /><br />Didn't need it after all<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Kiddy Hamman
B0027MJU00|4.0|The review of the darkest places of the human spirit reside within these pages.  Love Gillian Flynn! A must read!
1439153663|5.0|This is a book tht comes along rarely in our lives that helps to open our sensibilities to another day in history.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|The movie was so dark visually. It was hard to see all the beautiful clothes. The movie was, so frustrating to watch. The story was bad. Wished I  saved my hard-earned money.
B0053TMP24|4.0|There is little more delightful than hearing a child laugh from delight while reading a book.  My 10-year-old son has raced through each book in this series and knows more about mythology than most adults I know.  Rick Riordan brings ancient mythology to life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. It is hard and exciting. I love unlocking the characters. I love how they do the tour around the world
B007SRLEFS|5.0|Quality music and quality product.  Glen Hansard is true definition of a creative and powerful musician.  This album is better than 5 stars.
1451627297|5.0|1st Stephen King, and loved it. His writing reminds me of my favorite author -WALLY LAMB-. Will read his other books.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|I bought this on sale and I can't get it to install on my Kindle. I will keep trying tho.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This is a winner in the continuation of the Bourne series. You probably should buy this one as you will want to see it more than once to pick up on the finer story line details. Quality is perfect and the Amazon digital delivery works better than other digital delivery methods. Bravo!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Selected Best Picture for a reason. Watch and judge for yourself. However, my opinion stands favorably on this nominated and winning film. Script is fresh, story is well paced, and characters are well-developed. This movie gives you enough to leave you at the edge of your seat and has you thinking a lot after it ends. Highly recommend.
030796664X|1.0|NEEDS AN EDITOR!<br />This book is a steaming pile of redundancy.<br />There's enough material here for maybe a 10 page paper.<br />Over-long books are a really bad habit!<br />Don't waste your time on this one.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This is my second purchase and I bought three of them. This stylus is that good.<br /><br />If you are an artist who uses your tablet pc mostly drawing something, this stylus is for you.<br />Don't go for Wacom's Bamboo. Wacom is second to none when it comes to tablet. But its<br />Bamboo stylus has such a soft tip that you'll have harder time getting the satisfying level of<br />accuracy and precision in your drawing.<br /><br />And Cosmonaut's grip is almost perfect. It's just that after you use this for a couple of hours,<br />the black material will rub off of your middle finger. Just a little bit. Nothing much to worry about, though.
B00A1AU72A|5.0|Im trying to build a collection of dvds and what set isnt complete without this? I love older movies. I recommend this to anyone who likes scary movies.
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|It worked great for a while - I'd hook up my mac to the TV using an HDMI cable.  But after about a year and a half it got really finicky.  It only works now if it's elevated on top of something and requires a lot of finagling to get the connection going.  I'm not sure if there's a better product for this now - but know that it might poop out over time.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book really helped me in my journey to self-discovery. Highly recommend to anyone who's trying to understand the Laws of the Universe and uncover the true powers within.
B0083Z614S|5.0|My kids love to read and they love reading anything they get their hands on.  Just make sure it is appropriate for your grade level.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Zeppelin has always been one of my favorites, and this recording makes me like them even more.  What a sound!  The fact that John Bonham's son, Jason, is filling in on the drums is just plain awesome.  How often do you see world famous rock bands keep it in the family??  I love how this absolutely classic collection of music can still be played today and sound current.  Absolutely astonishing record.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Anyone who ca not afford $2.99 for the complete version will enjoy one.  It's been a long time coming!  It is a little difficult getting used to using a stylus or your finger, but it is still the fun music & challenges.  I LOVE PAC-MAN &  MS PAC-MAN should it be made for Aneroid.  TYVM for offering it @ an affordable price.  :-)
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Vonnegut is never a disappointment.  Plot that keeps one on the edge of her seat.  Twists that keep one intrigued.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved this as much as I loved the hunger games. Very well written and not a dull moment. I would recommend it to those who aren't into Harry potter or all those other fictional books- these are things that could actually happen to our civilization.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I LOVE this show.  My husband and I are completely addicted.<br />I avoided this show until now.  I finally caved while my son was on leave from the Army and we couldn't stop watching.  The writing and story are captivating.  It's fascinating to ponder what you would do in the same situation.  We found ourselves pausing the episodes and debating who was right/wrong, etc.  It's so hard to wait from week to week for the next show!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is such a cute movie. My kids love it and watch it over and over. It reminds me a lot of when I was growing up with the video places and the games I used to play!
B000JQU4TW|5.0|While the plot and subplots take many twists and turns, they are easy to follow.  The uncanny &#34;ability&#34; of the portrait is very intriguing.  Watch the movie after reading the novel.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|As always, a great, catchy, and emotional album from Tegan and Sara. Highly recommend adding this and their other albums to your playlist.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is an amazing release! Old school style lyrics meets new school beats, Positive lyrics not like other &#34;artists&#34; out there writing about sex, weed, and booze.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I thought this movie was great! Kept me on the edge of my seat. I thought Ben Affleck was great in this movie.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was a fan of the BBC show &#34;Sherlock&#34;, so was naturally interested to see how this show went down -- I am always very impressed with each episode!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great book.  Easy read. Connelly can keep your attention  and make it difficult to put down the book.This is another one of his action-packed novels.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|We saw the film about this singer. Fell for his sound and ordered tow of his CDs.  Then the film won an Oscar.  So sad I never had heard of him.  Great music and great story of this great artist.  SEARCHING FOR SURGARMAN.  Order is on Net Flix and watch it.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Great!  Delivered fast. I love this movie.  I have watched it at least 10 times since I got it.  It has a great ending.
B0015AARJI|5.0|My PS3 came with standard wireless remote game pads, and my wife and I always wanted a set of wireless game pads with vibration technology added.  These are just the ticket!
B003NX76BM|5.0|I love Nora Roberts. And I've been reading her books for years and she still continues to amaze  me. This is the second time I've read this book and I still feel the excitement  and tears and happiness!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love his music and this CD came in as ordered and on time.  Order was handled perfectly.  This vender is great.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I enjoyed watching it again. The kids loved it too. I will probably see it again some other time when I'm bored doing nothing.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|had it for a couple of months and it does exactly what I expected it to do. It's a challenge but it doesn't have any variety.  it's a timed challenge
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I know thrift shop kinda put this album on the map, but this dude writes about real stuff which has become a lost art on radio airwaves. This dude totally is genius!
B001VFTYW8|5.0|I absolutely love this series! I have loved all her books so far! I can't wait until I finish this and start the next one!
B004J4WL50|5.0|Very good read. I am enjoying. It is inspiring me to do something that matters. The book is encouraging and enlightening.
B008I43DYU|4.0|had it for a couple of months and it does exactly what I expected it to do. I am pleased with this purchase.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book is creepy, twisted, and ever changing. This is the second Gillian Flynn book I have read and now my favorite. I'm not sure who I am more disturbed by: Adora or Amma as they both are perfect villains. Again, the ending was brief but had a last second twist that I actually had to 're-read to fully understand what happened. Definitely recommend this read to anyone.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Although it was short (300ish pages) it was worth it!! Pat the main character has a sweet almost childlike personality that quickly sucks you in. It's funny and emotional and I wish there was more.
B000784WMW|5.0|Timothy Dalton fits this role, as he was born into it. The best version of all! It is a bit long, but the best experience :-)
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|it's exactly what i expected.  It's tough to advance and quite the challenge. I would recommend this game if you want a challenge
030758836X|5.0|I am an avid reader and I read this great novel last year when it was first released.  Unfortunately, that was before I owned my new Kindle Fire HD, and it was downloaded from B&N to my Nook (my e-reader at that time).  Nevertheless, this is one of the best books I've ever read...and definitely one of the best psychological thrillers. I highly recommend it anyone who reads books in this genre. I have since downloaded books onto my Kindle Fire HD, and am so glad I made the transition (upgrade) to the Kindle Fire HD. (ha, ha...here you get 2 reviews in 1)
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tegan and Sara bring a fresh and happy sound to their newest album, Heartthrob.  With their continued diversity in subject matter and passion for honesty in their work, Tegan and Sara bring fans an album that lifts spirits, empowers the heartbroken, and is all around feel good.

B008RA3X5E|4.0|had it for a couple of months and it does exactly what I expected it to do. I it drains the battery so if you are going to use this as an actual clock, then make sure you plug it in while in use.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It is rare that one can find honest love stories, so I applaud Matthew Quick for writing an excellent novel of modern, unconventional love.

B000FCKIFU|5.0|As usual, a fast moving story. The plot was well put together. Again, another book written by Baldacci that you just can't put down. Can't wait to start another one by him.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|This is one of the best films of all time.  The cast is excellent and Jimmy Stewart, who is wonderful in everything he did is perfect for the role of Elwood.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I love these books - they have helped me to think differently. I particularly love cooking as the model for learning other cool stuff. Awesome!

B002L3ARRU|5.0|Love this movie.  It's a classic.  As a Prime customer you can't beat the price.  Free .... watch it today
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I chose this book as a recommendation from a friend. I was not previously aware of what the book was about. I found the story to be sweet in nature however, the religious moral was very heavy and sewn throughout the text. It reminds me of a book I might have read in a college course on text interpretation.<br />In all, I liked the book but feel that the story could have been effectively written with less religious connotation.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This was a gift but the person I bought if for loves it and says it works perfectly for her.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I love it it's cool .I laterally of word on that I didn't know love school love reading hate the world
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is a major new talent on the scene.  I will read anything she writes now that I have sampled her powers as a writer.  She is elegant, brutally frank, and possesses descriptive powers that can make you laugh or burst into tears--I did both.  This memoir of her life and what she found out about herself on her solo trek of the Pacific Crest Trail is riveting reading of the best kind.  I especially recommend it to outdoor enthusiasts who can relate to the wilderness experiences she recounts, but anyone would love this book for its beautiful writing.,
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Led Zeppelin have proven themselfs to be one of the best bands ever.  Like the Stones, The Who, Pink Floyd, and The Doors - Led Zeppelin was at it's best live.  I could go one all day but great is great!  You'll love this album.<br />Pro: It's Led Zeppelin LIve!<br />Con: Nothing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Move over 50 Shades of Grey.. This book was un-put-downable!.. If you like this genre you will love this book!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Being that  Washington is a great actor In my opinion. All movies are excellent in which he has a leading role and  has a hand in as far as how his character is portrayed. Good Stuff !
1250007208|4.0|First, I just want to say how much I love the idea of this series. Each book in the futuristic sci-fi Lunar Chronicles is a retelling of a classic fairy tale, and I think that combo is magical. Cinder, obviously, is Cinderella. The sequel, Scarlet, is Little Red Riding Hood. And still to come are Cress (Rapunzel) and Winter (Snow White). Each book will continue the tales of the characters from the prior book while introducing us to new re-imaginings of the fairy tale characters, and while I have no idea how Marissa Meyer is going to pull that off, I'm thrilled about the concept.<br /><br />Now, talking about the book itself, Cinder was a fun protagonist. She was Cinderella meets Kaylee from Firefly, with robot parts. And I liked that although, like the fairy tale, Cinder's romance with the Prince was definitely part of the story, her main motivation was not love, it was independence. Cinder was prepared to pull herself up by her mechanical bootstraps, and I appreciated that about her.<br /><br />Prince Kai wasn't the most fleshed out of characters, although I liked him well enough. No, I didn't fully understand what made him so very appealing to Cinder, but he wasn't unappealing. I just didn't quite love him. But that's okay, since as I said, the love story was not actually central to the plot. I'm okay warming up to Kai over several books while I stay invested in the rest of the plot. Even Cinder ends the book not entirely sure about how she feels about him, so it's all right for me to feel the same way.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the way the fairy tale elements were woven into the story. There's still an evil stepmother, and an evil stepsister. There's a prince, and a ball. And there is the classic running-away-down-the-steps scene, although with a twist.<br /><br />But at the same time, there's an evil queen who rules a race of people who live on the moon, with mind control powers. There's political unrest. There's a mysterious plague. There's androids and hovers and cyborgs. So while it is recognizable as the fairy tale that inspired it, it also brings a lot of freshness and imagination that makes it stand out from the crowd.<br /><br />I will say it's a bit predictable. I called the big \\"twist\\" ending somewhere in the first 50 pages. But it didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book. I still loved to see how everything unfolded. The thing with fairy tale retellings is that we already know all the bones of the story, so I don't think a surprise ending is all that important. What matters is the creativity of how the tale is told, and how it differs from the original. The characters and setting and how they can hold my interest, even if I know (more or less) what's coming. And I think Cinder accomplished that in spades.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun, imaginative new series that puts an exciting sci-fi twist on the stories you grew up with, I'd highly recommend Cinder.s and cyborgs.

B002KYHZLQ|2.0|My first book by this author.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I have a poor memory for names, and this book has way too many characters, but I didn't like it overall.<br /><br />It left me confused most of time as to what was going on.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is just about perfect.  The story is good, the graphics are excellent.  Hidden object and puzzles are fun and challenging, but not insurmountable.  The hint in some reviews about the office were spot on and got me out of the office in good time.  The zoom works great with no fuzzing.  I may return and give it 5 stars when I finish.  Loving it so far.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|As a home chef and food lover, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Bourdain does a great job of describing a chef's world through his eyes, complete with all his misadventures and screw ups along the way. By the end of the book, I found myself glad I'm only a home chef, but excited to hit up some new restaurants and see what the pros are up to!
B00886XQO0|5.0|the louder it plays lol. now if they can come up with a way to mute the words outta my mouth playing online lol.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This was a surprisingly great series, I begain it with caution, as I am not a fan of the \\"way out there\\". Yet this was a great show that hooked me in and know I am a true fan.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|These are iconic movies that have withstood the test of time. Having them on Blu-Ray is nice and the extras were great. This would have been 5 stars, but the third Godfather movie is really not good and everyone mailed in their work.
B001B1CBSQ|5.0|This is an absolutely startling collection of music from Pras, Wyclef and the incomparable Lauryn Hill. Pretty much everything that can be said about this album has been said, but I just want to add that Lauryn Hill is a genius and easily a top 5 rapper of all time.
B004E1RYKA|5.0|I highly recommend this concert to Beyonce lovers. I previously checked it out of the library so many times I figured I might as well buy it. I also gave the dvd as a present to my best friend on her birthday. She loved it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers but ot wont let me update it I wonder why. anywaays........ subway surer is great! I love picking up jetpacks and getting the bouncy shoes! I think everyone should play also!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|SwiftKey has been the best Android keyboard on the market for quite some time now. Their latest significant update, which added Flow capability, is an admirable undertaking. Swype does the same thing better than SwiftKey, but no one does word prediction as well as SwiftKey. And going forward I fully expect SwiftKey Flow to improve to the point where it's better than Swype when it comes to tracing words. When it is superior to all others in all aspects, I will return to give the fifth star.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Ai love the game I have it n the Pc and the xbox and pe but pocket eddition does not have enchanting or brewing please add this
B0045HCJRG|5.0|I had been wanting to watch this recently, but had not seen it on Amazon Prime for free or Netflix. Saw this for a great price and now am watching on Plex on my Kindle Fire. Life is good!
0525952926|5.0|I really like Ken Follett and when I saw this come up as a holiday special for $5 it was a must read
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend this show for people who enjoy Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men. It is incredibly funny and witty. You will be laughing at every episode.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie, great video streaming quality. Great price for the movie as well. Will use Amazon to watch other movies in the future.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|fun game and good storyline. Download time was a little lengthy but it was worth it. love g5 games and like the demo you can get before you decide to purchase.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read<br />A must read book for all blacks. Go get this as fast as you can
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I bought the whole season and have been very pleased with the continuing story lines, excellent script and acting.  I can't wait for Season 4 to start.
1451638450|5.0|I have waited a long time for Ms Bujjold to get back to Miles & company.  Ivan is the hero this time, proving that he is not the idiot he  has sometimes  seemed to be.  The story moves along quickly with the unexpected twists and  humor found in the previous books in the series.  I enjoyed it very much and sincerely hope it signals more books to come in the series.
1441737499|5.0|I read this book when it first came out in the early 70's.  I was just a teenager and I absolutely loved it.  Working in my studio I love to listen to books on CD and I've been searching our local libraries for this book for a while.  No one had it so I finally purchased it. I just finished listening to it and hated for it to end.  I read all the other Richard Adams books, too, as a youth.<br />I plan to listen to this book several times over the next few years, and then will likely donate it to our local library.
B008220DIC|4.0|I watched imagining L. Ron Hubbard's downfall and scientology's rebirth 30 years after this story ends.  This disciple figure is increasingly mystified instead of clarified.  Somebody in Hollywood should have had the guts to convince Anderson that the last acts diminished rather than inspired the viewer's curiosity.  It's still worth watching for the flawless cinematography.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I love it ! Great for relaxing and just having fun. Easy Game to play!! Me and my grand daughter often play against each other.
B007GE2H3G|1.0|This was to stupid for my taste.  As soon as I got into the story, something real dumb happened.  I didn't realize it was dumb comedy, I thought it was just a fictional detective story.  I will not finish this story, as I do not care how it ends.
B0085FS3S8|5.0|If you love Testament you'll love this album. Vinyl showed up in perfect condition as soon as you hear that crackle and the first song start your hooked. Whether you get It on vinyl,cd, or digital just get it, it's too awesome to pass over.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It was kind of a sad story but I enjoyed reading this book.<br />This was the authors first book & I like the way her writing kept me interested & I had to keep reading until the end of the story.
0439023521|5.0|Great story, very easy and quick to read.  I really enjoyed reading this and will plan to read the next in the series.
B004WR125O|2.0|I mainly purchased this wireless adapter to receive the rare firmware update and to occasionally stream music from my phone or computer. I will say that it does just fine when you need to download a firmware update, but don't count on it to do much else. When trying to stream music from my phone, this thing skips about every 20 seconds, and it's NOT a problem with my phone or wireless router. This thing just doesn't pick up a good wireless signal. You might think that they fit some high quality wireless receiver technology into such a small package, but you would be wrong. This thing might be compact and look nice and sport the Onkyo name, but it's not worth your money. You're better off going with some other type of battle-tested USB wireless LAN adapter.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Great Music, and I got it on sale for two bucks. Supremacy and Panic Station alone are worth that price.
B008B68J2G|4.0|this Cafe set is a fun addition to the monster high collection, especially those with world travel likes.<br />What is a trip to Paris without checking out your neighborhood CAfe cart!<br />I really like the color scheme with this set.  It has a coffee machine accessory that is way cute.<br />I like the idea of adding accessories for the monster high set that do not just revolve around rooms.<br />This was a big hit with my 10 year old monster high fan.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these books. I've never made real time to read books but there was so much hype for these, that I was intrigued. I laughed, I cried, I was scared, and I was turned on!! Thank you!
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|so it arrived soon and i just love it and its perfect conditions :D<br />im miss gossip girl im so excited to see it
B004LP3AYI|4.0|A good fun read and  follow up to Wizard First Rule.<br /> The story starts moving right out of  the gate getting right to the action. It slows down a bit towards the middle and I found myself frustrated Witt some of the choices by the characters even though in the end they seemed to be reasoned.<br />My only issue with the sorry was the ending seemed a bit rushed. Lost of time for development and creating a set of problems for out hero, Richard Rahl to solve. Then suddenly, with a couple of quick decisions they are solved and the story is as an end.<br />Even with my issues, the characters and the setting remain interesting and I will continue to read the series.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|super cute color!  Orange!  Works just wonderful. Looks much more expensive than it cost.  So much better than I had expected! Very,very happy with this purchase!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a very quick read. It was filled with reality and true emotion! It made me want to see the movie. It rates as a favorite for me!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book...makes me wish I had read the first book before I saw the movie! I'm looking forward to the last book.
B003RV43X4|4.0|My son was doing some assignments for school relating to Greek mythology and we just ordered this movie on amazon tv it was a great break and helped out with my sons studies
B00000JXVK|5.0|I bought this DVD for my fiance who was a professional flat tracker.  He had this in VHS now he can watch it anytime.
0345803507|1.0|Alright, what did just happen?<br />i left a negative review for the first book (because it was a badly written plotless junk) and immediately three 5-stars reviews appeared.<br />IMMEDIATELY!<br />I had heard about the fraud but didn't think it could be real. i believe it now.<br />Ok, it's not a crime against humanity but it's fraud, it's wrong, it's unfair.<br />i checked one of those 5-star review which had appeared immediately. it was one sentence, and the reviewer had copy-pasted the same review for all 50shades books, and as if it was not enough, she had also copy-pasted the SAME sentence for a totally different book.<br />Don't believe me?<br />There you go:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A1OG63OYIDD3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview<br /><br />And check this one too :)<br />http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ7CWARNBXRS5/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345803485&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=#wasThisHelpful<br /><br />Jimi Hendrix?!! o.O<br /><br />Am I going mad, or is something really wrong?<br /><br />Ok, now seriously, stop this; this is so wrong, unfair, dishonest. Stop buying and selling reviews, it's not fair.<br /><br />p.s. i wonder if another 3 5-star reviews will follow my negative one.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have watched the Game of Thrones on tv and it immediately claimed my attention and imagination. Now I have read the first book. It is just as good as the show. This is truly amazing and I cannot wait to read the next. I have read the books Fifty Shades of Grey and Game of Thrones is far superior.
1451637500|5.0|My first book by Bujold.. actuallt my first fiction book in a year, due to exams ect.<br />I could hardly put it down. My tv was pitch black during my reading of this book :-P<br />Most recommended for both techies and the average detective litterature fan.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Much better than I expected. I chew through science fiction especially military/tech/hardware genre. This is very high in terms of intelligently thought out, not just bang, zap, hit the hyperspace stuff. sets up character development for other books instead of fully fleshing out in this volume my only &#34;gripe&#34;.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|because it's a story for everyone, regardless the time we live in.<br />it's sweet, warm book with alive characters for whom you can't help caring.<br />i never liked Amy, she was always to mannerish for me, but the relationship between the sisters and their mom is beautiful.<br />How much they love their mother!<br />It's a beautiful, sweet, warm, and kind story. I could use so many adjectives.<br />I will love this book always.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|I stumbled across this gem listening to Jango radio. Her songs and lyrics get their hooks into you and you can't get them out of your head. There are times when I love an artist and there may be songs I don't particularly care for but in Lana's case, I truly love them all! I can't wait until she puts out another album and I would LOVE to see her live. Do youself a favor and check her out...you won't regret it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved it!  No a soap opera person.  But I loved the charm of this era and the mostly clean and tastefully done scenes.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Sure, Sinatra backed by Nelson Riddle would be his path to immortality. But, put The Chairman in front of The Count and his orchestra in the familiar surroundings of The Sands casino and you've got the makings of an unforgettable experience. Kind of like if Elvis was backed up by the late '60's version of The Beatles or Rolling Stones. Jump aboard THIS music time machine!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|i have recently decided to start reading contemporary young adult (till this day i didn't find any title interesting) and borrowed this from a friend.<br />i have to admit that i liked it. it's a fine, entertaining book, though it did not leave me impressed enough to read the rest (especially when now i know how the story ends), but i may read the sequels sometime later.<br />Frankly, i did not like Katniss, but there were other interesting characters and their fates kept me interested. After i read Hunger Games book 1, I watched the movie and liked it, too. as i said, both the book and the movie are entertaining. i won't call this a deep or haunting story, but it does not pretend to be one. Pure entertainment, and i liked it for what it was.
B00021R7CG|4.0|Watched this movie back in the 80s and with all the apocalyptic movies today decided to watch it again. Movie was used but in good shape. Delivery was somewhat slow for a DVD buy, it took a couple weeks to arrive. Price was too good to complain though. Would use seller again.
B005Y4241K|5.0|It's Adele, what's not to like?  The only problem is it has been &#34;cleansed&#34; of some of her colorful language.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing hollar and you can read the rest of the dairy of a wimpy kid series by Jeff Kinney  peace
B0084B5TK8|5.0|A horror story when horror was horror.<br />Not like today's copy-pasted cliched vampire stories with sexy, hot, glittering vamps, but a real horror, a real story about an unheard monster which shapeshifts into bats and rats, which makes you shiver and gives you goosebums.<br />For me Dracula is the best horror novel, the scariest and the most original.<br />i also love that the story is told via letters and journals.<br />A great book.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The movies aren't in question, but I suppose everything else is.  Shipped on time, no damage and everything worked great.  The subtitles didn't show for most scenes even when enabled, but eventually worked.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|FANTASTIC, I really enjoyed it! It was so exciting and suspenseful. I truly like the way it ended too. Lee Ann
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|An absolutely phenomenal book. Clancy is awesome. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of the Ryan novels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's sick and awesome. It is well addictive and I go on it a lot. It's my favourite app yeah
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I loved this story when I was a girl.  That was quite a while back!  I just re-read it; it's still one that touches my heart.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|this is a great mobile facebook app.  gives me everything that I can do from my PC.  much better than other facebook apps that I have tried.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a very interesting book with lots of insight into what our fighting forces encounter. It has some very technical information on types of equipment they use which I did not understand but I am sure those who have served our Country will enjoy. The book will give you an even deeper respect for those who serve and their families.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|great for those times during the day or evening I need a little relax time. helps with getting to sleep as well.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really loved this book!  I loved the adventure, her honesty and the story.  I felt like I was on the trail with her.  I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a little adventure and a good story line.  Sure hope she goes on  another adventure.
B0053F03MM|5.0|I enjoyed the movie at the theater, and with my Prime account via PS-3 couldn't ask for more!  Thanks Amazon.
1616550414|3.0|I had been expecting a more in world kind of book. Like I wanted a bestiary and a some details about the world.  I was a little disappointed to find that for the most part it is just an art book. The coolest thing in the book is the timeline, but it is only a small part of the book.<br />All in all I am not disappointed with my purchase, but I expected better.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Stunningly visual, with many images reminding of Alien. At whiles also close to 2001 Space Odyssey, but never equal to either of them.<br />Pretty stupid story, in fact. It goes top find answers to the origin of mankind, but keeps losing the objective and continually sidetracks into often inept substory arcs (that are not even always closed).<br />At whiles it  becomes ridiculous: dr Shaw's bloody cesarean, after which she is immediately able to run, fight, etc! Weyland's presence on board, to a very flimsy end indeed. Bitchy female Vicker's medical pod geared for a male patient only. And revealed to be Weyland's manipulating daughter. Charlie Holloway poisoned by android David, why? Ah, wait: so he can engross his girl friend with an octopoid fetus that ultimately invades the interstellar humanoid and causes him to spawn the Alien? David, reduced to a bodiless head, capable of steering the alien spaceship to the actual origin planet of mankind? Gee, is there a limit to stretching the suspension of disbelief?<br />Furthermore, the movie misses the claustrophobic atmosphere of Alien, never does it create tension or anguish, in many ways it flops just like avatar flopped, by having no substance to the story..
B00243FQFA|5.0|I loved this series from the beginning and never missed it when it was on Syfy Channel.  Getting to watch the series all over was great, and reminded me how much I liked it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was recommended by a  my daughter in law,I loved it from beginning to end.What a heartfelt romantic story.I stayed up all night to see what happens next.Very good read.Will read another Colleen Hoover.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|well the game dosent realy have a point to it but run from a monkey endlessly I dealt don't see why everybody gives this game a five star I realty don't so don't yell at me for not likeing this game okay.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I think this is as great an adaptation of the comic book series that could ever be made.<br />I won't review the film, you KNOW the film if you're perusing this page already. If you love 'V for Vendetta' and 'From Hell' well... I'm pretty sure you have an open mind and love challenging films - this is one of those type of films - challenging in many ways, theory, philosophy, people, abstracts, pop culture, power madism, grunge, holistic unholyisms etc.<br /><br />Alas, I WILL comment on the GOUGHING GREEDINESS currently on display here by  GottaSeeOdyssey trying to ripoff people at $149+!! Oh yeah... If you're an Amazon Prime member you get Free Shipping - WHAT A DEAL eh?<br /><br />My advice is to not encourage these price gouging sludgers and let them eat their stock UNSOLD.
B00006AW63|1.0|The DVD would not play.  It said &#34;Regional Error&#34; and since it came from the UK, that may have something to do with it.  Am returning it and hoping for a replacement that works.<br /><br />Lynn Redford
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|In Blu-ray is seems like you can crawl into the gorgeous set. Wow. Well placed close captioning which helps, although the sound quality is great too.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I enjoyed reading this novel quite a bit at first.  It has vivid characters, an interesting setting, and immediately sucks you in when you start reading.  The plot moves along very smoothly until about halfway through the book, when Murakami seems to have lost sight of his plot.  He devolves into semi-mystical meandering, peppered with occasional references to the plot and laden with out-of-place sex scenes which just feel odd.  I'll grant Murakami that he effectively conveys the sense of unease that one might feel upon entering an alien world much like one's own, but when he purposely flaunts that he is violating several rules of foreshadowing just for the sake of violating them, it is very distracting to the reader.  At the end, he leaves most of his plot threads unresolved, leaving the reader feeling unsatisfied and frankly, a little bit bored.

0385344228|3.0|(Beware a spoiler) Other reviewers have already picked apart the characters. I agree that they are not believable. So as a family drama, the book is laughable. As a mystery thriller, it is for the most part pretty readable, but the real mystery to me is, what's with that gene?<br /><br />I don't mean whether or not one gene can actually account for a person's behavior. Leaving that aside, my question is: How was the \\"MAOA knockout\\" gene passed on from father to son, when (as stated correctly) it is located on the X chromosome? Males receive their X chromosome from their mother, not from their father!<br /><br />Either I am overlooking something, or William Landay committed a crime against one of the dogmata of genetics, and got away with it.<br /><br />Or is he implying that Laurie in fact knew the correct genetics, convinced herself that she herself carried (and could have passed on to Jacob) the \\"murderer gene\\", and by driving into a bridge abutment tried to fulfill her destiny?
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I watch this the first time on the plane in a long flight, very good and keep me on my toe.  You won't be sorry to buy this DVD.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Such a great album - all the great songs plus some comedy as well from the Chairman of the Board.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I thought this book was better than the first book!  I am just getting ready to start the mimi book about Link and then on to the last book in the series!  I hope to enjoy these last two books as much as the first two!
030758836X|5.0|Initially I was planning on doing video review then that changed to a regular written review, but in the end, I decided against both.  Only because I couldn't have talked about this book in detail and coherently without giving away major spoilers. And trust me, you don't want to be spoiled on this.  You want to experience it first hand. So I decided to keep this, short and sweet and as spoiler free as possible.  I enjoyed how it was written from two points of view. It was imperative that it was told in the way it was. we needed to see Amy's take on things as well as Nick's to get the full story. Gillian Flynn is an amazing writer and has great skills in the story telling department.  It was a well paced read and I wanted to read it all the way through in one day, but sadly, life gets in the way and I had to consume this book over a week or so. I savored this over many lunch hours!<br /><br />Let me just say, you start out thinking one thing, but then book goes completely to the left at precisely halfway through the story. Believe me, you'll be like &#34;What?&#34; &#34;OMG?&#34; &#34;For real?!&#34;. Can you say Lifetime movie? I loved ever moment of it.  Amy, the wife, is seriously cray-cray. And the husband Nick is an idiot!  I sort of felt pretty quickly that Nick was being setup, but I had no clue how, and then when it came out, I was like &#34;Well played!&#34;...and I'm not saying what happened! You have to read the book!  I can't even say too much more with out giving away major spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I opened this book, not knowing what to expect. I heard good things, but I was just hoping I would feel just as great about the book as others did. Most times I'm disappointed, but not in this case, it delivered! I really enjoyed this book.  Like books where several of the major characters are more than a little cray-cray? Like drama? This book is for you.<br /><br />This was my first time reading Gillian Flynn, but it won't be my last!<br /><br />Here are just a few of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />“Republicans go to Sam's Club, Democrats go to Costco.” <br />“There’s something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.” <br />“In truth, I wanted her to read my mind so I didn't have to stoop to the womanly art of articulation.”r /><br />Here are just a few of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />“Republicans go to Sam's Club, Democrats go to Costco.” <br />“There’s something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.” <br />“In truth, I wanted her to read my mind so I didn't have to stoop to the womanly art of articulation.”
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great show.  What a crazy way to live.  I couldn't imagine living within such a caste system--being stuck at the bottom, or worse being stuck at the top.  So many secrets kept and told.  So many characters to love and hate.  Maggie Smith is the best.  She just cracks me up.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|From what I understood, my grandson had watched it and said he'd like to own it.  So Grandma bought it for him.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|Really nice Cd for the money.  I love Talking Heads and Amazon has the best price going for this Cd.  I have no complaints regarding quality and would recommend this to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a nice game.  I'm just not good at playing it. My daughter has it and she loves it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am thrilled I could watch the second season of Downton Abbey via the web b/c of having Amazon prime.  The benefits of having it are endless.  This show is amazingly written and produced and a breath of fresh air to this horrible time period of reality tv. The BBC should take a bow and we should all applaud them for bringing us such magnificent shows to watch.  (See also Call the Midwife.)
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The authors create a complex world of which the world we know is only a part.  The Southern setting is fascinating and amusing at many points.  Characters have depth and relationships are complex in many ways, yet can be identified with in other ways.  No way the movie could have done the writing justice.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I came across this CD after hearing Thrift Shop played on local radio.  The beats in that song I find intoxicating, I love bass.  I also enjoyed that it was a rap song not talking about b..s and hos, guns and drugs, as I am a father now.  I bought the CD for that single song but little did I know the entire album is great.<br /><br />Best yet my 15 yr old daughter is in love with this album too.  And very happy that I bought it.<br /><br />The songs are all very upbeat high tempo and clean.
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I was hoping that this was going to give me footage like in the video I watched on Amazon.  It took a while to set it up properly.  The footage swirls and does not remain stable when you move at all.  I tried it with my gopro and with the dslr camera with very limited results at best most of the time it made me seasick to watch the footage sure was hoping it would work better than that.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Automatic update from 6 to 7.  Imagine my surprise the app icon disappeared from the app and home screens.  Hard to use guys when you can't launch it. Missing in both devices.<br />Acer Iconia A500 Tab version 4.03<br />Google Play Samsung Galaxy Nexus version 4.2.2
B008518MOW|5.0|I like MIB3 better than MIB2, but the original MIB is still the best.<br />This combo pack is great.<br />The 3D version is spectacular, and I sold the DVD version that I didn't need.<br />A great buy at a great price.
B001AFF25W|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Though most readers would generally be aware of the ideas being presented, I found the book concise, easy to read and ideas quite practical.<br />The way information is presented makes it easy for readers to implement in real life. Would surely recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Himanshu P.<br />Chicago
B000THCFA2|4.0|I'm way late on getting this, but it's good to hear Dilla's audio sketchbook. You'll hear the stems of songs that came from this project. And I've always love Gobstopper!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Product is small and very portable, does a good job of sharpening blades. Just what is needed when sharpening your blade may be necessary.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|What a great CD!  When I discovered it was a concept-story album, I was wondering if it could be pulled off.  YES!  They did a great job of incorporating stand-alone pure rock songs with a storyline that when listened to from beginning to end makes sense.  Of course the favorite is In the End because it just rocks and the lyrics hit hard and awesome.  Nobody's Hero will be the hidden gem, great song, great lyrics.  Starting off with I am Bulletproof was the perfect song!  If a movie has indeed been made, I cannot wait to see it!
B00514HDNW|4.0|Nothing wrong with the \\"RosettaBooks into Film\\" edition except maybe two or three typos that I noticed. This edition includes only the novella, which is 159 pages.<br />As to the story, it is well written, exciting, and thought-provoking. It is also of some historical note, having greatly influenced Romero 's Night of the Living Dead. The story was first published in 1954.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Being from Philly, of course I had to read this book after hearing my brother's talk about the movie.  I'll see the move later.  The father bases his happiness on the Eagles' football standings?  Crazy but hilarious because I know people just like him.  The book is honest in it's telling of the story of mental illness which can be sad at times, but uplifting at others.  It isn't always easy to read because of these reasons but you care about the characters and want to know what happens to them by the end of the story.  Great read and I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This offers hours of fun and is more challenging than the first game.  My family enjoys challenging each other to see who can get a better score.  I like it better than the first game.
B003WQT2YY|1.0|I've been updating my VHS collection to DVD's when I see a good buy.  I decided to get the Director's cut of Amadeus which had deleted scenes added.  I was prepared for them some of them being silly or unnecessary (as some were), but overall they RUIN the movie!  For one thing, the rating is changed from PG to R!  I wasn't aware of this when I bought it, but I can see why!  I wish I could erase these extra scenes from my memory.  You could sympathize with Salieri in the original release.  With the deleted scenes added, he's just a villain -- guilty of far worse crimes than anything he accuses Mozart of.  The point of the movie is lost, the characters no longer make sense.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|It was a perfect gift. She  loved it and it brought back memories. I will be buying another one soon
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent show with compelling story lines. The Kindle HD brings the show to life! The characters are well rounded and each is played well by the actors! Can't wait for the next show!

B0094K1WZE|5.0|This was another typically good movie in the Mission Impossible series. The skyscraper scene was pretty good but as a whole the whole movie kept my attention.
1580088694|5.0|Ever wonder what people in the 'other' places on this planet eat?  It is very interesting to read<br />and see (pictures included) how they plan their food purchases, what they buy and how that<br />changes from place to place on this planet.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I like it. Like any Muse album it grows on you. I especially liked the two tracks written and sung by the bass player. It was refreshing. I didn't like the dubstep stuff though.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is cool, and my son loves it. I wish it were ad free, but haven't gone to that expense. yet.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is fun, says my six year old. He doesn't like it as well as some, but he does enjoy it.
0811806405|4.0|Great book, marred only by lack of references to certain things, such as luthier disk.  Great reference though. Supplement it with info you can retrieve via Google searches.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is a great game it rocks and is an important gAme to me that you like to just admit it

B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book was put together for an interesting read.  Touched on many aspects of his background and career. I enjoyed the book very much and will look forward to reading it again and again.  Chris was a truly great military man and American hero.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|I watched the preview of this film and thought it looked interesting. It was far from what I expected. I watched very intently for the entire length of the film and expected that possibly the end may give some clue of the point they were trying to convey. I was sadly mistaken. Glad I didn't go to the theatre to see it. Should have waited for it to come out on netflix. This is where films this bad go to fade into obscurity. If you are going watch this film make sure you don't pay for it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Such a terrific story! I was completely drawn in and kept engaged throughout the book. Really good characters too. I totally recommend this book!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a simple easy to read book that reveals profound truths about how to think about yourself and others, how to act, and how to live without fear and in peace.
B000067QMD|5.0|has been very useful, also bought Philips AVENT BPA in baby bottles to store. and not use the nipples. good product
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is almost just as fun as the normal version but its missing something. in creative mode you cant set lava water or light off Tnt so other than that its awsome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love Subway Surfer. I find the game so fun and entertaining. Plus is a fun challenge against my friends. Can play for hours with all the missions and challenges. Great fun!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The story line, the graphics, and the games were all top of the line. The hidden objects weren't a massive mess but made sense in the game, a pile a debris or old toys for example. The other games were also integral to the game and I was able to complete most of them with only a handful of skips, which means most folks would be able to do them all! I did use the hint button quite a bit to figure out where I was supposed to go next, but I think that shows how good the game is - I don't like a game that gives me no challenge. This game offers you three levels of challenge at the beginning. Definitely worth the money.
0880793082|4.0|I've had and used this deck for years. This was actually a replacement deck for me. This is one that you don't need to know all of your astrology back ground or quabalah but it is really useful to get the fullest potential out of this deck. The images can be dark and disturbing but also can be light hearted too. If you're faint of heart though don't bother.

B007JMW46U|5.0|This is the classic Sherlock Holmes.  I have always enjoyed Sherlock Holmes and recommend those books to other mystery readers.  There some terms that I don't understand at first but can usually figure  it out with the rest of the context.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read, had me on the edge of my seat, did not expect it to end the way it did.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I had this app and loved it. I ended up getting 40000 coins for a character ( it took me for ever to get) and today it had a pop up saying I should update, so I went to the app store and there were no updates so I went back to the app and I realized that I  lost everything including that character that I bought. I recommend not getting the Rome update.
B007SZQXXI|3.0|Not as provocative compared to other Shakespeare's play.  I wish the word tempest alone brough power to the story nonetheless,  Miranda got lucky.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. Love the story, it is a dark period drama. Slow in places, so you have to be in the mood for it. The music is haunting, truly beautiful. I simply can`t get enough of Ralph Fiennes`s performance!!! He 100% becomes Heathcliff. At the age of 30, (maybe even 29), it is simply breathtaking! He is gorgeous, dark, passionate, me (and my friends as well), can`t take my eyes of him. He is extremely cold and extremely hot at the same time. He loves and hates her at the same time. There is NO point of making this movie ever again, as this is it, if you don`t like this version, you will never like any version. He should have gotten an Oscar for this IMO. Ok, love the story, love him, love Juliette B. too and the other actors.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Great game but you shouldn't have to buy Zeus and atom and all them. over all a great game I give it 5 stars
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this.  I play till my battery runs down.  Then recharge and go again.I have suggested it to all my friends
1451675046|5.0|I felt as if Professor Dawkins walked me through each subject personally. An amazing introduction to science, surprisingly I thought I knew a lot about some of the content. I discovered that I could learn a lot more... And from such a small book. It keeps you interested and intrigued throughout, with a perfect blend of humor and seriousness. A new favorite.
1847940684|5.0|Larry Bossidy means business.  Discipline is a great thing in this world.  I found his methods fascinating and useful for people who want to work hard and don't expect everything handed to them in life.  This book gets 6 out of 5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great sequel to the first temple run. The especially fun part is the added curves and newer graphics.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Never been more in love.... The twists the turns the ups the downs... The fire... Yum yum yum.. Good enough to &#34;eat&#34;
B00881VLCE|3.0|There were several for the initial puzzle.  When I requested more puzzles, there were only a few of each, nothing like the several for the initial puzzle.  Kind of disappointing.
B004SUDPWI|4.0|The movie is an excellent adaptation but can't quite match the mastery of the original novel.  It has an all-star cast.  The cinematography is fine as is the pacing.  If it lacks anything, its the depth of the novel, which is a common failing in film adaptions.  I recommend it for war and drama buffs alike.
B005HSL626|5.0|is a very fun game that you can play forever on and not get to bored. Well worth the money.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan's voice is angelic, reflecting capacity for deep emotions and the ability to communicate that through music. I respect her as a person. She has experienced hardship.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Good visual quality & just a great show. It's not like any other show on. Wonderful casting and fantastic story lines.
0316236535|5.0|Mine are 3 and 2 years.  Both adore this book, starting around 18 months.  Have to be a little careful with pages as they can tear easy, but they so for this over and over.  Very clever way to build a book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book that will grab your imagination and hold even after you are done reading it. There are also several sequels so......enjoy!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love Nelson DeMille and own all his books.  This one, however, was rather boring.  It cannot compare to his Lion books.  It was more like a lecture on Yemen...not much action.  I still love DeMille and look forward to his next book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just loved Series 1 & 2 but Series 3 is even better.  Recommend it to anyone who loves great acting, scripting and sumptuous settings.
B001DF68MA|4.0|This kid seat rocks!  Keeps the kids where you want them, in the center.  We used this with our girls as young as 9 months, with no issues at all.  I would rate it a 5 star if the straps were quicker and easier to adjust.  The seat transfers from bike to bike easy IF you already have a crossbar installed on the second bike.  Installing the crossbar takes a little bit of time.  Definitely buy the spare crossbar if you are planning to mount on more than one bike.  Also, make sure your top tube on the bike is not arched in the middle, like on some beach cruisers.  The crossbar won't mount well witha high arch top tube.  If the head tube on the bike doesn't stick up past the top tube, you could have an issue too.  But for MOST bikes, this thing is great.  Kids love it.  My wife ( who is paranoid about everything with the kids) even likes taking them out with this.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|A very fun game for a while.....after about 5 hours its gets pretty old. But its fun while it lasts!

B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the website; love this app.  My fiance glares at my Kindle because once I open it, I am browsing for a LONG time!  I have an HTC Thunderbolt and the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; and the app works beautifully on both of them.  I'm able to browse, see those I'm following, re-pin, start a new board, and open and make changes to my account.  All around nice job, Pinterest people!  User friendly, and fully functioning.
B0086700CM|5.0|A very fun game that is well worth what little you pay for it! This is a great game and it also has sequels, so have fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to sit down and relax and play a few hands its a good game to think with.  I have it on my kindle also.
B006MPKE9O|3.0|I had read a lot of hype about this book so perhaps I was expecting too much. I found it a bit long-winded,without really going anywhere.If you like reading light weight &#34;fluff&#34; then this would probably appeal.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My sister and I play this together and it is so fun to see who can get the furthest lol

B00ARX2W24|5.0|Originally released in May of 1982, Fandango is Herb Alpert's best album since the breakup of the Tijuana Brass.  The collection of songs on this CD makes you feel like you are listening to the Tijuana Brass with a slightly more modern latin sound.  Song number seven and song number eight (Coco Loco and Aria, respectively) could have easily been performed by Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass.  Close your eyes and you will be agree.  This is a very playable CD and easy to listen to.  If you did not care for his last couple of CDs that he originally made in the late 80s and early 90s, then this is the CD for you.<br /><br />The song list is as follows:<br />1.  Fandango<br />2.  Margarita<br />3.  Push and Pull<br />4.  California Blues<br />5.  Quiereme Tal Como Soy (Love Me the Way I Am), featuring some vocals by Herb Alpert<br />6.  Route 101<br />7.  Coco Loco (La Guajira)<br />8.  Aria<br />9.  Angel<br />10.  Sugarloaf<br />11.  Latin Medley (Frenesi, Bahia, Moliendo Cafe, Porompompero)<br /><br />If you have never heard any of these songs, you might find some of them to listen to on You Tube.  After hearing them there, you will definitely want to purchase this CD.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really good book but the ending was to abrupt anyway still a really awesome book read the awesome book! Peacr

My diabetic alert tattoo is perfect and this app helped with this process! Thank you to the developers
1609611543|2.0|The author makes many claims and he tries to back them up but his sources do not substantiate his claims very strongly. I didn't believe his points about how wheat is extremely addictive and how wheat (but not other high-carb foods) exclusively cause all sorts of health problems. I think that wheat is addictive because it is a starchy, carb-loaded food, not because of the glutens and glutenins. I think that that the majority of the health benefits reaped by his patients when they quit eating wheat were because they were mostly on a low-carb diet. Only a few health issues are caused exclusively by wheat.<br /><br />This is really just another low-carb book in disguise. I'm gonna re-sell mine.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you love temple run one you'll love two's new obstacles and upgrades. Highly recommend it! My favorite part is riding in the mine cart and gliding on the ropes.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|As an action movie I thought it was decent, it delivered what I expected:Stuff exploding and lots of shooting and fighting.  Not going to win any major awards, but if just looking for cheap thrills and silly one liners, you will be happy
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It runs so slow. Takes forever to load pics and video. I thought that the recent update was supposed to fix that issue? Ugh well  I guess a detailed app like this always will need work
B0080CKGZE|5.0|A good movie with a lot of food for thought.  Well acted and a big piece of social commentary for days gone by.
B00701897I|5.0|Loved the movie in the theater and after getting 3D glasses (Playstation 3 3D glasses) the experience was almost the same in the theater albeit not the great surround sound, but definitely an excellent time.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|Loved the movie, a unique idea, and I thought something fresh for hollywood.  Also one of my favorite actors in Timothy Olyphant so that was a pleasure.  Great performances all around, and would recommend it to anyone.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I never thought the Blu-Ray version of the Godfather would really improve on the quality of picture and sound, but Im glad I brought this. Huge fan of The Godfather and this is a must have!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The movie was funny! I liked it a lot!!! Love Amazon instant video's~ So nice renting movies right from the television!
B009GX6600|5.0|Been really enjoying this season, but it has been a very emotional ride, lots of things going on to tug at the heart strings, enjoyed the development in most of the major characters, and I thought they played them well
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Fair amount of action but lacked the tech toys of past Bond movies.  I miss the old Q and his vast array of innovative toys.  The heart and soul of James Bond seemed to be missing.. he seemed detached and the story seemed to drag at times.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was thinking as I read the last book, that this is one of those fairy tales that comes true in these three books. It is a wonderful love story, filled with exotic personal tales like one might find in life filled with suspense, thrills and more.<br /><br />I am sure everyone looks forward to the next trilogy.<br /><br />It earned five stars totally!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Edgar Rice Burrough's hero of Mars is right on. Critics that only watch film and never read the books need to become a literate person. Don't judge a movie until you read the book.
B0043D2LAC|5.0|Versatile design and well constructed to accommodate everything from smaller lens' to flash or a second body.  Exactly what the Dr. ordered for access to items on the fly.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Have Accuweather on my iPad and as they say &#34; It's a no brainah&#34;. Accuweather has the most knowledgable meteorologist around and their forecasting is dead on nearly 100% of the time.  I'm a weather buff and I have a 8 year old son who does as his dad does and follows the weather like an adult, with accuweather on his iPad as well.  He tells me the upcoming forecast now.  We love Bernie Rayno, as he does the forecasting for my state of Maine.  Cuddo's to Bernie as he is, in my book, one of the best!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I am waiting for the day when Mr Dick's story will be more done more in line with his original idea<br /><br />but this was a good action vehicle for all performaers
B000A6EXNO|5.0|This is a useful product for those photographers who wear glasses and want to cut the glare out of the viewfinder without banging or smudging your glasses. As always, Adorama delivers as promised with quick, reliable and best price service.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Even though you knew the outcome, it still kept you on the edge of your seat! Definitely would recommend watching this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very good temple run is not better this subway surfers i think everyone who enjoys temple run will absolutely love this
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Kyle and his co authors do a nice job of providing insight to the mind and motivations of this true warrior, warts and all . It is even more touching since Kyle's recent murder by a troubled vet. Interlaced with writing from Kyle's wife to provide a full perspective on this life. It is comforting to know America still produces men like this.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I love this love album.  Sinatra is a great entertainer and you get a glimpse of what it's like to be at a live show.
B004SKQAJI|5.0|I love Michael Flatley and this was awesome!  A good buy!<br />I am very pleased with this<br />Would recommend highly
B004TI5N38|2.0|Perhaps fame and fortune have gone to Baldacci's head, but, this is, by far, the worst of five of his books I've read.  The central character, Puller, is not developed at all.  All we know about him is that he is big and strong, a decorated war fighter, who knows how to kill people.  The plot is weak.  If you like action stories about strong military-type guys, try Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.  Puller is a pale imitation of Reacher.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|WOW!!!  I have them all, but this cd is now my favorite JB release and that feeling is shared by several of my women veteran friends.  We get together monthly to just let our hair down and have some fun.  We are mostly Vietnam Era vets, but we have 2 friends from the Middle East conflicts.  Recently, while driving to our latest adventure, I played this disc.  The ladies absolutely loved it from the very first note of \\"Dislocated Boy\\" to the last of \\"Too Much Ain't Enough Love\\".  Talk about a great dance tune.  But, the title song, \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\", was the song that really hit us.  One of the ladies is struggling with PTSD.  When the song finished playing, she asked if I would repeat it.  After the second play, she said \\"That song says it all for me.  That's how I feel\\".  As you can imagine, we all had tears after playing it again.  I still can't help but tear-up everytime I listen to it.<br /><br />Thank you Joe.  You'll probably never know what the song means to us.  But, I was raised to not say anything about someone unless it was positive.  And, for me this is positively the best, so far, from JB.  This album and its title track says it all.  So, take Joe's advice and turn it up.  You won't be sorry and I guarantee if your neighbors like good music, they won't mind.  Just tell them that if it's too loud, they're too old!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched all three sasons of Downton Abbey, and being English, I have enjoyed every episode...this IS how they lived, and some still do. So very sad to see 'Matthew' go...more sadness after a blessing. Looking forward to season 4, to see how Mary copes without the love of her life.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Lots of humor along the way.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I can barely wait to begin reading the next in the series.
B000FC1192|3.0|It didn't seem as whimsical as the movie, but the story was very nice. I feel like it gave a little more insight to the characters and the story then the movie had.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this show. It is very entertaining, and full of drama, as well as comedy!  The producers couldn't have picked better actors to play the main characters!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. It helps me get up in the mornings because it has the volume crescendo. I recommend this to anyone who needs an alarm.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great stories and analogies to see the world of habits and why we do the things we do. Will definitely apply to my own life
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this show to everyone!<br />Season one and two were better, but season three lived up to its expectations.<br />There is always so much going on to keep you on the edge of your seat.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The first chapter seemed a little dry, hard to get into but after that the story breaks wide open with a surprise ending I never saw coming!  New to kindle, but def have more Nicholas Sparks on my list if must reads!!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|I simply got a digital copy of this - no issues arose and i got what i expected. Simple as that.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This was a great way to spend time with Nathon Fillion any time I wanted. I have enjoyed him in everything I have ever seen him in to this day. The quality of the DVD was very nice. It was better than watching it on TV, NO COMMERCIALS. I highly recommend purchasing this and any other DVDs in this series.
B009GFEOY8|4.0|Great film, I'm hoping it's the cameras fault but only about half of the exposures went through, gave great pictures.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is totally awesome. rocks.nsuck balls.  my mom. randomnsh t boys boy boy boy boy boy boy boy boy
0765325950|4.0|this is it.. the last one... there is room for epic after epic across the sea, the age of legends as a prequel, the children of the dragon... but alas is I mentioned.. this is it.<br /><br />well done troop!
B004Y042N8|2.0|The game has a nice, clean look. The puzzles are at just the right difficulty to be a quick, fun distraction when you have a couple of minutes to kill.<br /><br />Unfortunately the game started demanding internet access via a pop-up message, and will not run if it isn't given it.  The purchase, licensing and delivery are handled by the Amazon app store; there are no ads to be downloaded and it's not an online game.  There is no legitimate reason for this game to demand access to my wi-fi or data connection.
B00AQ2KLEM|2.0|It has the same songs as the Deluxe Edition, but costs twice as much.  I thought I would be getting extra features, but I did not even include a digital copy of the CD!
0920668372|5.0|if you have children or a close relationship with your mother, you are going have tears.  Do not try to read it out loud with out tissue.
B004IFD9HE|4.0|funny, keeps your attention; not hilarious, but enjoyable and clean even for little kids. My wife and I enjoyed it too.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book provided the inspiration I needed to de clutter.  I'm now looking forward to a simpler life and spending my money on experiences rather than things.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I really enjoy this series. Can't wait for the next one to come out. You will want to get all of the series
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game is very challenging and interesting.  glad I downloaded it. brain power being used. a great game for recognition.
B00766CLPI|2.0|This is the Remastering of the original &#34;Classical Barbra&#34; from 1975, plus two unreleased outtakes. However the remastering work has been really awful, and the original recordings sound better than this compilation. Since Amazon didn't sell the new songs individually, I purchased the CD, but I made a new one with the 1975 originals and this two new songs. A missed opportunity from Sony, again, since the recordings were from the time when Barbra's voice was at her peak.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband. We both watched it and it is a very good movie. I am happy with this dvd.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|With all that is going on in our lives its good to watch some nonsense sometimes It was intertaining to watch
B000AMJC2K|5.0|exelente articulo, buen desempeño y practico buena relacion calidad precio, util si tienes poco espacio en el escritorio y se desea aprovecharlo en mejor forma
B00BESLHEA|5.0|This was the most fun I had watching a. movie in a long time.  It brings you back to the corporate what great entertainment is all about.  Sexy, fast, simple, and meaningful. Perfect distraction from the issues of the day and an escape based upon the eternal hope that good will prevail! Can't wait for the sequel!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|It was too dark and made no sense.Why does Holywood insist on making movies so dark and ugly?BW is a good actor.He can act very well,but this was a dumb movie
1451695195|4.0|This is a fascinating account of this doctors trip  to the other side. He is very logical in his approach to this subject. I enjoy hearing from the nay sayers, and many times those in the medical profession simply explain away NDE as a chemical reaction. By the end of the book, he is quite certain of what he experienced. If only we could all be so lucky to have an undeniable spiritual experience which settles the question of what are we all here  for.
0671015206|3.0|A little simple but I guess you have to start somewhere.  It's a quick read.  Aparently me review is 5 words short.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game it's ok I'll give it 50/50 is really great but the only messed up part is you have to pay for more diamonds once you run out but anyway I need friends plz my code is a01o49
0452295548|4.0|Good book especially if you have a family member or know someone with mental illness or stroke. This author has lived with both schizophrenia and stroke. Her brother suffered from schizophrenia, and she suffered a stroke. At the end of the book she has provided info on resources available.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Great game. I cannot stop playing. I am now playing it over again.  It looks amazing on my kindle fire.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|works and looks great on my HD 8.9  a little too much &quot;clock&quot; but to the point on gettin instant revue of weather.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'm probably the last person on the planet without a Kindle so I put this on my phone. it works great and kept me sane on an 8 hour trip. Books download quickly and you can increase the font, change the background color and more, I like getting books from my library and have them sent to my Amazon account. If you don't know how to do this, many libraries will show you for free. That feature really helps when I'm reading a cookbook while at the store shopping for ingredients.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|After so many years of not putting out any music, you can wonder if the artist has lost it, but Fiona's music is still as good as it ever was.
B000I9YLUI|4.0|Not as good as the BBC series, but very nice. It gives the story another flavor. Didn't like the &#34;American ending&#34; - although I don't oppose a nice kiss at the end of a love story, the final scene is not coherent with the general atmosphere of the movie.

B001DUDKEY|5.0|This movie is good. Austen's book, though less known than Pride and Predjudice, is a very good read, and this movie does it justice. The characters are nicely painted, and the actors do a good job!
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Bought both this and the TV mount.  I have about 4-5 feet between my TV and the sofa.  The sensor was not able to pick up for floor at first.  After moving my TV as far back on the table it is on it was able to find it.  Had in issues playing Kinect Adventures.  Looking forward to trying Nike +.
0553593714|5.0|I can't wait to get home from work so I can crack open this book and see what happens next!  The world R.R. Martin has created is so detailed and full  and his characters are so true to life, you feel as though they're real.  I haven't even finished the book and I'm ready to order the next one in the series.
0312323867|4.0|\\"Something Blue\\" by Emily Griffin<br />  When I saw the book was about Darcy.  I didn't want to read it.  My friend said \\"stick with it you might be surprised\\".  I thought \\"I already bought it... so I guess\\".  The book evolves nicely.  It's realistic.  The book has a lot of real life situations.  It hit a point in the book where I couldn't put the book down.  It was a lighter read for me.  I had fun.  I was surprised how the characters evolved.  I recommend reading it.  I want to read the next book of the series.
1608871045|4.0|I bought this to add to my Batman collection. This book is pretty neat, and it gives the &#34;technical details&#34; and blueprints of many of the vehicles and equipment from the Nolan trilogy. After reading through it once, there's not much reason to look again, but it looks good on the shelf next to the rest of the books.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|I don't have much else to say. This is Riverside with Lunatic Soul bled into it, it works brilliantly and touched all the right emotions.
1401235417|5.0|This was the first Batman I had read from Scott Snyder, and have since gone back and started buying all of his other works. This is a great way to start the new 52
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Story was a little far fetched to be sure.  Very disappointed. Glad I read Gone Girl first; otherwise I probably wouldn't have ordered another book from Ms. Flynn.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Let's face it, the song &#34;Radioactive&#34; brought me here.  I was not disappointed with the other songs either.  You won't be dissappointed either.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  It kept you spellbound every minute.  Gave it to my daughter to read and she loved it also.  Would recommend it to everyone.  Great mystery........
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Greatest sitcom ever on TV. The extra features are great. Episode guide makes it easy to find your favorite episodes, but I just like to watch from Disc 1 to the end.
B0042GNDO8|5.0|Violin playing of the very highest order. Heifetz recordings, together with those of Oistrakh and Milstein are the must-haves for any student of the violin.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is a really cute game but I wish that it was easier to &#34;purchase&#34; houses and pets more quickly.  My girls LOVE to play this game but I am not about to pay to purchase kibble or any other item so that they can aquire items.  Overall though, it keeps them entertained.
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|There's a good story at the heart of this documentary, an extremely likeable protagonist, in my opinion, and on those assets, the filmmakers need only to stay out of the way...  They do, and consequently I think this is a very solid film, I think it's worth a watch
B004TI5N38|4.0|a good read. It held my attention and it is reccomended The author once again writes a good story with this book
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is so cool. This is about a kid who finds his inner strength and goes on a journey. I would say this book is for 10 year olds with good reading ability and up.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good love story by Sparks with a nice mix of suspense and mystery.  Now I'm eager to see it on the big screen.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This was good to have and fun...but it ultimately was too easy and my wife burned through it like a flame on dry tinder. But, that's what you get for something &#34;free&#34;
B0063IYR4I|5.0|I have been practicing breathing methods to help with anxiety issues and it was o.k. For a beginner this app helps you focus more on your breathing and not the stuff around you by giving you a cue for breathing in and out. You don't have to count as I was told to do in the other sites and videos that I watched. You start as a beginner and slowly work your way through the levels.
0312944926|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book. The story kept me turning the pages wanting to find out what happened next. I like the fact that there were two strong main characters. The pace is frenetic and the story line is interesting. I enjoyed the description of Seville and the chace through that city. If you want a fun, quick read, choose this book!

B0002VFXFE|5.0|very good product, I am satisfied with the purchase.<br />very good product, I am satisfied with the purchase.<br />very good product, I am satisfied with the purchase.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|TOP NOTCH AS FAR AS ENTERTAINMENT GOES, even fi it's not a factual account. And try not to remember those CIA helicopters that really failed out in the desert.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game! I enjoy playing it more than the first temple run, and I like the different obstacles that you get to tackel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am totally enjoying Downton Abbey and have recommended it to several friends.  Great story, beautiful costumes, fabulous acting.  This Masterpiece Classic is a winner!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|SUBWAY SURFERS IS THE COOLEST GAME! I love all the boards an  people. Their unique and very creative.Who ever made this game high five!!:) I must say congrats to this game=)!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a delightful series, with a great story line, wonderful characters and superb acting.  I am totally engrossed in the lives of the Crawley family and their household!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love it, simple to use but has tons of customization available. Have yet to have an issue with it and it does what it needs to; wakes me up on time in the mornings :P
B004QK6Z6I|4.0|First read it about 1970's and couldn't put it down. Just re-read it and loved it again, but didn't find it quite as compelling. Too detailed with names of numerous French government departments and names of people in them. Fascinated by how much methods of  communications have changed!<br /><br />I was as intrigued as at my first reading (perhaps even more so) by the &#34;Jackal&#34; character, and the policeman, Lebel.<br /><br />Due to this book, I then read many of John Le Carre's spy stories and loved them too, but not as much as &#34;The Day of the Jackal.&#34;
B002M84BN0|5.0|Music is great, story is great overall thoroughly entertaining. Will watch it a hundred times. Why can't they make movies like this again
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|This movie is entertaining, motivational and informative.  Each character is well developed and exemplifies excellence of character.  It is a great history lesson as well.  I watch this movie every year and it inspires each time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The beginning of the book was kind of slow, but when it started going I could not put it down! Sparks will leave you on the edge of your seat and shock you at the end. This was an amazing book, way better than the movie, btw.
B005PTYOTE|4.0|We spend a entire day watching these movies while it was snowing out and enjoyed each one of them. The action of the movies kept us interested and watching, story lines are good. I would honestly recommend this collection if you enjoy the Mission Impossible movies and make sure to add Ghost Protocol as well. We already owned the last movie and the first movie we had in VHS format so it had to be updated and what better way to do that but with blue ray.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and kid friendly.I enjoy playing . It helps me learn about math and statistics. I also love the competition.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I raced through this book in record time.  Great  references  and consistent action kept the book interesting and moving along.  I recommend this book to any scifi fantasy  fans and especially to those who played video games in the 80's.
B0054SMID0|4.0|I wasn't sure where this movie was going, and I like that in a movie.  There was no way I could predict the ending.
160309007X|5.0|Note: This review was an old post I wrote on a comics review site shortly after LoEG 2009 was released back in July 2012 for another review site. I should have posted this on Amazon as well, but better late than never.<br /><br />League of Extraordinary Gentlemen 2009<br /><br />I am not much of a comics fan. There are very few works that interest me (same as for film, television, and anime). It is actually Alan Moore who first attracted me to the allure of the comics and the full potential the medium can provide for storytelling film and novels cannot.<br /><br />I was looking forward to reading his latest League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series. I initially did not enjoy Volume 3: Century, the first two parts (1910 and 1969) seemed to have no plot and were just games of \\"find Waldo\\". But this time around with Century 2009, it finally feels like there is a story. 2009 is the last puzzle piece that ties everything together and completes the Century arc.<br /><br />I love Alan Moore's interviews and reading his commentary, I only have read a few of his comics. Now I understand the appeal of Alan Moore. While his stories may appear chaotic on the surface, they are clearly well plotted with layers of metaphorical symbolism which make sense at the end. Multiple rereadings also help. Century also supports Moore's claim that there are certain things comics can offer to the narrative arts that films or novels can't. There is scenes in this comic, drawn by the talented Kevin O'Neill, that move like a film yet allow for reader to take in all the elements at their own pace. The story's plotting and pacing could have only been done in this medium.<br /><br />I must say that this was a fun read. I have not been this entertained or at awe of what this medium could achieve since reading Scott Pilgrim. The storyline moved fast yet every moment was packed filled with excitement much like the Dark Knight film. This story symbolically serves as Moore's critique of the present state of popular culture and entertainment, of how imagination, creativity, and originality in the narrative art mediums have been replaced with rehashing franchised characters. Moore pokes fun at this by having multiple Bonds appear while the original is kept on a life support, other scene has characters from a 80's television show beating up an actor from the a 2009 remake.<br /><br />An interesting note is the use of female protagonist in this final issue. Moore mentioned he used Gentlemen in the title instead of Gentlefolk to illustrate the sexism of the times, now 100 years later the people who save the day are all females. Even the new female M is the first honorable person to hold the position previously occupied by corrupt males. This might be Moore's claim that culture is shifting towards stories with strong female characters written by female writers, which may explain while the animated shows of Lauren Faust and Brenda Chapman's Brave are so popular today. In film, television, comics, and literature female creators seem to making a big impact on today's culture, look at J. K. Rowling for example.<br /><br />Speaking of whom, a lot of people were complaining about the use of a certain bespectacled boy wizard own by Warner (Tim Hunter from The Books of Magic or Tommy Taylor from Unwritten I believe) being used as the Antichrist in this story, which may not be a bad thing as Moore has made his heroine Promethea the Antichrist in his previous comic which was a good thing.<br /><br />However, when the League travels through the walls at King's Cross to get to the secret magical train platform, they don't use Platform 9 ¾ but Platform 13 (from The Secret of Platform 13 about a secret train to a magic school published in 1994). When they go to the magic school there is not a signal sign that says Hogwarts, however Weirdsisters College (from The Worst Witch spin off) is present.<br /><br />And the file of the boy wizard the League takes, does it say Harry Potter? No,it says Will Stanton (a boy who discovers he is a wizard and goes to a magic school to defeat the dark powers from the 1973 Dark is Rising Novel). Back at the train station they see a sign for Groosham Grange (a magic school with moving paintings attended by another boy wizard from the 1988 novel).<br /><br />All the references Moore used, which people claimed plagiarized J. K. Rowling's creation, actually came from completely different, older British works about boy wizards and magical schools. This is a clever layered move on Moore's part to protect himself when hinting at the more popular boy wizard franchise, yet at the same time making the point that J. K. Rowling is also borrowing from other works of fiction. (Though I must say, showing the boy wizard from a first person shooter point of view not only was a clever way to hide his face, but also subtle commentary on the rise of video games and school violence.)<br /><br />This goes with what Moore said about the literary game writers play when addressing the issue of using other creators' characters in his works like Lost Girls and LoEG and the difference of Before Watchmen. An example he states of Jules Verne continuing Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym with An Antarctic Mystery, with HP Lovecraft further continuing this \\"literary game\\" with the Mountains of Madness, yet each time adding something new to the narrative.<br /><br />It is also understandable why Moore may dislike Rowling. For Moore art is not like magic, it is magic. Our art is a transformative force that can change the reader and culture. When he claims he is a magician, he is right in the sense the uses words in his spell to create a new world out of nothing that can have an impact on those who see this creation. And when you are one who believes art to be magic and present culture in decline with artist, creators, and writings rehashing mind numbing crud as opposed to innovative transformative pieces, than you can see why he might have something against the boy wizard.<br /><br />This issue set in 2009 is packed with references to modern culture, which were easier for me to spot compared to the Victorian and 60's eras. References to Doctor Who, Lost, 24, West Wing, 30 Rock, Simpsons, and numerous other modern works were present. I personally loved an obscure South Park reference (which appears only a hardcore South Park fan like myself got) and a poster for the Wonderbolts from Friendship is Magic in the background. 2009 makes full use of the comics medium in ways I have not seen before, Moore's writing is once again fun and without rape, and O'Neill's art stands out in this visual medium, tying everything together.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It's quick and so easy to do. It downlods real well and the picture and sound are great.And if used with amazon unbox it's that much better.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very handy to have, enables a quick estimate of the power reserves available to complete tasks before you need to recharge.Glad I have it.
B004M5HUXE|5.0|this book is very interesting to say the least.  It gives the reader a very clear view inside the mind of a women.
B001AQMBL4|5.0|This very funny comedy is entertaining in it's theater version, and hilarious in the unrated Blu-ray edition.  It takes one back to the hoots an' hollers of our school days, but these may be even wilder than most people remember from their own youthful escapades.  The unrated version comes with a hearty recommendation for a riot of laughs, screams an' misbehavior...'Get th' popcorn!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I fell in love with the game. It was addictive. I collected thousands of points, characters, and hover boards, but then one day I opened up the game and everything I earned and collected was gone. It was upsetting. So, now I barely play with it unless I'm bored. So sad because it was one of the few games I actually played with. Never again.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|This apocalyptic view of the havoc of a global superstorm tests the boundaries of our imaginations but is highly entertaining while doing so...The special effects are breathtaking, and the fearful possibly that such a disaster on this scale COULD actually happen is always in the back of the viewer's mind.  The story has warm personal touches, great acts of heroism, good character development and strong performances from a fine and well-picked cast.  It has many hold-your-breath moments, and plenty of pin-you-to-your-seat action.  This terrific story comes highly recommended...especially in the beauty of Blu-ray.
1608955702|5.0|Neil van Niekerk is master of the bounce flash - but as made evident by this book, he is also a master of light in any form. Let's face it, available light is not always sufficient nor ideal, but there is always a solution - and Neil will help you find it. He starts by looking for the best available light in any given location, determines via test shots if that light is main or ambient, then walks you through positioning both the subject and yourself, the photographer, to find the most pleasing angle or direction of light. All the while paying close attention to (a) how the background elements will enhance the image, (b) adjusting shutter speed for the desired ambient levels, and (c) setting the most appropriate aperture for depth of field and/or flash volume.<br /><br />When circumstances require, we determine if a scene or image can be improved or totally re-imagined by way of flash - whether it be off-camera, on-camera with bounce, modified with flags, softboxes, etc.<br /><br />This book is more about the artistry of light and not the mathematics of light - it's all about developing a sense of how light can be manipulated to achieve beautiful results in-camera. It contains gorgeous portraiture throughout, really inspiring stuff, with pull-back shots, ambient light test shots, flawed examples that lead to adjustments, and the final image. You feel like you are participating in a well-run workshop, where you are learning from a friend in an intuitive, casual, engaging, and easy-to-understand manner.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for photographers who are looking to maximize their understanding of light and how to use it. And isn't that everyone?
B0083GQKQG|4.0|A good read but deep.  This is something no parent should or wants to be faced with.  I think it is a great book club book but its not for everyone.  There is no happy ending but does make you dig deep and ask yourself what would you do?  When I read the book I wish I knew someone who had also read the book because there were so many things I wanted to talk about.  But again this book is not for everyone because it deals with something none of us wants to be a part of.  We know it happens but not to us or even in our neighborhood, it happens to other people in other places.  But the truth is it can happen to us and I think that is what is so scary.
B002LFAHBO|1.0|I bought it for my girl friend we watched it and it will probably never be opened again. Movie was boring and the characters were not very interesting.
B00BIQU1K4|4.0|I have had only a couple of listenings, but this continues to prove Steve Wilson knows how to make music that is original and thought provoking.  At this time I think &#34;Grace for Drowning&#34; was over all  a bit better, but I am sure as I get to know this album better, it will stand well with &#34;Insurgentes&#34; and &#34;GfD&#34; as outstanding albums.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series and will most certainly read the series again. The last book is my favorite book ever!
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|They try to introduce too much and edited it down. The action is okay, acting varies . Some sets are great others make little sense. Empty your head and take the trip if you've got time to kill
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was immediately drawn into the story as the characters were so believable. This was a book not to be put down.
1441408266|4.0|I gave this a 4 star because its a good read.  I am a slow reader and had to read this a couple times since I was not able to pick up everything the first time.  Very interesting.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|fun filled never be bored again<br />realistic action and sensitive pad reaction beats most games out there<br />I love it my friends love it
B0086449YA|5.0|One of his best cds of the year.  What a pleasure to listen to this music.  I have nothing more to say.
1454701250|5.0|Gorgeous book, easy explanations to make beautiful impressions with own handcarved stamps. A super artful and inspirational book, I enjoyed it from first to last page.
B0019IB0II|5.0|A brain doctor having brain problems? Could there be a more effective way to learn about what you are studying? This book is beautifully written, an easy read. The author is able to give a perspective never given before. Huge impact in the world of stroke research.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is definitely worth the money. Incredibly funny. Haven't missed an episode since it came out. Can't wait for more episodes
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Something a wee different. I gave it 4 stars instead of 3...mainly for effort and originality.  But it is really no more than half  the read as Old Man War, which was excellent....and now a favorite of mine. Still a good read.
B0091W5UWG|5.0|great picture quality ...movie is still just as fabulous as it was the 1st time i watched it...would reccommend it
B00821OX98|4.0|I was hooked, watched the whole series in a couple of weeks.<br />I like the character development and the interplay of the characters and their personal objectives.<br />I appreciated that it was not as violent as other shows in this genre.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I hate it tried to play last night, you have to go to Facebook to play the game it for my grandson!!!
B00AH6CCK8|5.0|When I first heard of this concert, I will admit, I was dubious about how good it would actually be. A classical symphony orchestra accompanying Metallica? The idea of those two being able to mesh did not exist in my head. However, not only do they mesh, I, like many people, think the S&M versions of the songs sound even better than they do when played by Metallica alone. The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra was incredible, and my only regret is that more concerts such as this have not happened since.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This a good game but I have it on my phone and I think I'm tired of it so I give an OK.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter loves the book and this was a nice addition to the series.  Great price compared to the local book store.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|In terms of plot, you (as the male main character) are a high-school student moving to the countryside to stay with a relative while your parents are overseas. Once you arrive in the small town of Inaba, you soon become enmeshed in a series of strange serial-killings that seem to relate to a television program known as The Midnight Show.<br /><br />You eventually make friends with a core group of students who become part of your investigation team, with additional people joining your team as the investigation progresses. There are a LOT of activities to participate in from fishing to reading to catching bugs or even building model robots, scooters, etc. if you want. You can also participate in the sports clubs or culture clubs (one of each only - you can't be on the soccer team AND basketball team at the same time). The school clubs are basically additional stories and relationships that will provide you with two soul separate soul links (if you were hoping to actually play basketball...no).<br /><br />The key to advancing your power in combat is through building relationships with your friends and other individuals, and you can even develop romances with some of the characters if you want (or you can friendzone them permanently at a certain point in your relationship(s). As your soul links increase (think of them as friendship levels), they provide extra experience when you create new persona(s) and/or access to new and more powerful personas.<br /><br />Personas are basically aspects of your mind/personality given form. Combat is reasonably complex with a mixture of elements - every persona, along with your enemies (entities known as Shadows), have strengths, weaknesses, immunities, etc. I think that the system is fairly deep but not too difficult to pick up on if you're played other JRPGs. There are also multiple difficulty levels for everyone, so even if you have limited experience, you can make it all the way to end.<br /><br />I hadn't played any previous games in the series until P4G, but I actually managed to finish it on Very Hard on my first try - not that I recommend anyone else do that. I sort of did it as a personal challenge, heh. Anyhow, the graphics are topnotch for the Vita. How to describe the graphics...your characters basically look like tiny anime characters in 3D form (especially if you end up zoomed in close), and the world is quite detailed/realistic (you can even see a train zipping along on the rails from a distance on the town map). I think the dungeons are great, with unique designs for each one and challenging bosses (although I don't want to say too much about it - spoilers & all).<br /><br />The music is excellent as well, especially if you like JPOP. As for the story and characters, I found the characters engaging and quite likeable as a whole. The story was unique for me (especially since you end up inside a tv world trying to rescue people), and the voice-acting made it all quite enjoyable. I generally hate dubbing when watching anime or foreign films, but the English voice-acting was solid. However, you have the option to use the original Japanese VA if you want, which is great!<br /><br />In terms of replayability, there is NG+ (and unless you follow a guide, it'll probably be difficult to max out all s. links in one run). You get to keep your entire persona compendium, all stat bonuses and all your money. Additionally, you're able to adjust quite a few individual options once you finish your first run. For example, you can change the enemy difficulty, the amount of money that drops, etc. There are also a lot of extras you can access from the main menu (some of which unlock as your progress through the game).<br /><br />There's even an extra character with her own storyline in P4G (her name is Marie). I really think this is a great game, and it certainly makes it worth owning a Vita in my opinion. I actually did three full runs, plus a partial fourth run for a final achievement I needed. Mytotal time was around 230 hours because I really, REALLY enjoyed the game.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|Just a standard hood - not much to say other than it seems the finish has changed a bit compared to the one that came with my lens. The original hood saved my lens when I was shooting basketball by taking a ball impact. Reason I do not shoot without them on.
B001AITGWE|5.0|Watched this when I was younger.  Still a great movie. I I I i i I I i i i
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|great effects.  i like these kind of movies.  sinister fits the bill.  great watching. You never know where you move too.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|How many times have I seen this movie?! I thoroughly enjoyed it once again.  I really think I saw things this time that I had missed before....Bueller, Bueller, Bueller...still lives on!!
B0039O8AQK|5.0|great movie. we're getting to this now just like orwell wrote.  cameras everywhere, don't say that, don't do that because big brother is watching you.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|same as the other ones. not really scary. made me giggle. overall it was OK. that is all. thank you
B00B49L7JY|5.0|finally rodriguez is getting recognized.  where is all the money from the other side that belongs to him?  the music business is like  a bunch of big crooks.
B00A8Z6KN8|4.0|Though it wasn't all that I was hoping for / thinking it was, this soundtrack is very good. I enjoy Howard Shore, and I enjoy the adventurous, epic qualities of this music.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app to kill time and stay entertained. Easy and fun as well. Like the graphics and the fact that it doesn't freeze our force close, works great on my kindle he. Recommend this game.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I seriously enjoyed this movie! Suspense, action, thought provoking...couldn't ask for a better cast. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy a good thriller.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I love this movie.  It's fun, exciting, well-made and the entire family can (and should) watch it.  I have watched it hundreds of times and will watch it again and again and again.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really, really liked this book.  The story line was solid, I liked the characters and it had a twist ending.
1419701533|5.0|Just as described. Great packing in plastic wrap. Pefect. I would recommend it to anyone for purcahsing! Great price also!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just as gripping and uplifting as season 1, I could not stop watching after the first episode. It was a feel good season and left me feeling good and did not leave me feeling like I was missing something after watching the 9th episode. I would recommend this season, as I would season 1, to anyone. Unlike Season 3, which was very dark and left me feeling very sad and anxious as they killed two major characters.
B005LAII12|4.0|TED has some really hilarious moments and writer/director/co-star Seth McFarlane spares no one in his often crude script.  Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are surprisingly effective, as is McFarlane's motion-capture as the rambunctious title character.  Some fun cameos from Norah Jones, Sam Jones, Tom Skerritt and Ryan Reynolds.  Giovanni Ribisi, Patrick Warburton and Joel McHale provide good supporting moments.<br />TED is not a great movie but you will find yourself laughing a lot before the guilt settles in.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I got the app when it was free on daily special. And I love it. Clean UI and good reception. Thnx guys.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This a classic British series about a household of people living together (both upstairs & downstairs).  It is well written and superbly portrayed by an incredible cast of actors.  If you haven't seen it, catch up!<br />Pat
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Quick delivery - two days! No bumps/rips/tears, CD works perfectly! If your child or friend is a One Direction fan, I'd recommend this in a heartbeat!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I give the whole cast of Downtown Abbey 5 stars for stellar performances of fascinating personalities demonstrating the changing world in the early 1900's from a period of aristocratic snobbery to downstairs pettiness, yet heartfelt emotions throughout.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I always loved this album,  now it is so easy to listen to anywhere I am.  I have justed started my cloud collection and am looking forward to more.
B004N868DS|5.0|I was buying 2 - 3 mouse pads a year. They would eventually curl up and there was nothing to correct the problem. Finally, found this and I love it. You won't be disappointed.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie really set me back. Not only does it follow the book amazingly, it also has this way about making you feel every emotion that you're meant to feel. All of the actors involved did an amazing job! I would definitely recommend this film. Definitely in my top 5 favorite films!
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I can't trumpet this device enough. i use it with an external high gain antenna amazing.25 miles<br />don't think too hard about this one just get it
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not nearly as good as first book, but I`m compelled to complete trilogy.  Predictable outcome.  Guessing third book is equally predictable.
B002NWXRYY|4.0|Great romance and comedy - even the kids liked it.  Timeless, don't think it will ever go out of style
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This season was great but a little heavy.  Hopefully they give us a break from tragedy next season.  Special features were good as well.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Well done - it's like watching it on the big screen.  Sound and graphics are great - It's now part of our collection.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|The album starts off with some very strong tracks, take a walk, carried away. It is enjoyable the whole way through. Great sophomore effort.
B0094K1QR8|2.0|This movie dragged - it was cute and funny in some places.  Overall better than the really stupid comedies - watching it once was enough.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|After reading the book several years ago, I wondered how a movie could capture this story without  making into a special affect serial with no plot.  Well now I know.  It is definitely a keeper and I will add it to my library so I can watch it again and again
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Well directed with a good selection of actors. Have viewed more than once. The clearness of blu-ray gives a sense of realness
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I am so glad to see that they were letting Bond age and not try to &#34;young&#34; him up.  He is sexy, viral and still the man you want on your side. Great plot and just a wonderful escape.  That's what I want from a movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Its and awesome game.There is still a lot I'm learning but I'm getting there I have my eight year old son playing The Oregon Trail on his kindle also. Its a very enjoyable game to play.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|The story was very good but i have to admit, coming from the error of Hitchcock, Anthony Hopkins make up was lacking.  I feel like he captured the escence of the man to a tee.  My favorite part was his narration at the end of the picture remenicant of  Hitch's monologe I was use to seeing at the end of his television series.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I can't make it work and can't find directions, I tor one drawing to work, then it started telling me to draw stupid stuff??
0061992860|5.0|This tiny handbook basically has everything you would ever want to know about survival strategies.  I would highly reccomend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this on my ipod and on my kindle fire! That's how much I Luv Luv LUV this game
1455523550|5.0|omg this book was wonderful and I definitely give it 5* b/c i couldnt put it down!  It was a great love story with some drama thrown in! It was set in a North Carolina beach town and boy did he make you want to go to the beach and everything was so detailed you could imagine being there!  I loved his characters and descriptons of them b/c you wanted to love or hate them.  I dont want to give to much away but if you have ever been shy of opening up to someone or not wanting to reveal your past and have or had trust issues this a great book to redeam your faith in life! Life is a beach and love to the fullest every day b/c you dont know when tomorrow is your last! I strongly strongly recommend this book as I couldnt put it down and read it in a few days! I will be reading many many more books of Nicholas sparks and cant wait to see the movie! Keep them coming!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in 2 days!! And this is unheard of because I have a 2 year old son. But I just couldn't wait to see how it ended. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed!!
0345803493|1.0|I haven't read the 'Fifty Shades' edition but thought the writer would make the characters more interesting and exciting in the 2nd book. Well!! After the first 2 chapters, I gave up, put the book on the shelf and don't expect to waste any more time with it. Its SO<br />NOTHING! Why was it even published? I'd send it back except for the work involved. I may just give it to Good Will.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love this show. Watch it all the time, and wish someone would pick the series back up. &#34;Everything's Shiney!&#34;
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I sing his songs no matter what time of day it is...He is funny, romantic and classy....You go Bruno!  Keep up the good work..that's how songs should sound and be about!
B00B0NDF26|3.0|closer\\" has to be the best song here!...followed by \\"love they say\\" and 'goodbye,\\" most if not all of them are about relationships, yeah!.. some cheesy lyrics here!..over all i think this is a good electro-pop album.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie with a wonderful message. You can never fail with watching a Denzel movie. Has to be one of the best actors out there.
B000244FDW|5.0|One of the Best, but I must admit I prefer the one with Elizabeth Garvey as the lead.....Also the Mr. Darcy.  Hard to get a copy that isn't flawed in someway though.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book. Read it twice and love how you just get into it.I just wish there was more to twilight.
B0083H6AQA|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. Robert Pattinson was great in this film. The other actors were also quite good. Would watch this movie again.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Different from their previous albums like So Jelous and the Con but equally as good. So glad they're still making great music.
B004NELBPC|1.0|Downloaded it and it worked the first day, second day it was a blank page, not worth downloading to Kindle.
B001O1O71C|4.0|The book lets you see two perspectives at one time and it surrounds the Holocaust which means that it's really sad.
B001XVD1II|4.0|Not too fond on the women terminator in this one. Great action and suspense though. I recommend this one. I'll be back!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It was awesome!!!I loved it!cool I'd give it five stars!<br /><br />P.S. Jeff Kinney. are you going to make another book please?
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Very good movie....action etc....but we miss the other Bourne ones......it's hard to switch to a new main character.....worth buying...but make sure you have the other  Bourne movies first....this is our last pick of the collection. Still a good movie to own though
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I, for one, am a big fan of Muse and I am very interested in the new direction they are taking their music.  Everyone has heard Madness on the radio, and even though it's different from their old stuff, stuff it was like a breath of fresh air.  I certainly recommend this CD to any Muse fan, young and old.
B007MDB6L0|3.0|This is a good movie...but if you were looking at all the Tinkerbell movies lined up, this is our least favorite....just not as exciting as the others. Glad we have it...but if you are trying to choose, go with one of the others first.
1451695187|5.0|It's nice to see a fellow physician grow Spiritually.  I'm seeing it happen lots these days.  Thank you Dr. Alexander.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Nice movie to have.....makes you think about the Holocaust and be able to watch it in a more lighthearted way than some movies (yet still seeing the true horrible nature of the event)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|just getting started with it so far it semms to work very good  i thank i will get a lot of use of it,, but retreving the down loads is a reel pain in the neck, there should be a link to take you to the retrevile site from the icon or the purchase site, much confusion , said to down the apps store  did that an thats not the place you need to go to retreve the dowload
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thought, oh another slave story.  But once captured by the depth of characters and the reality that was felt, I read for hours on end
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Awesome game a true Oregonal from the past just entirely more fun than the older version that not only previous generations could enjoy ,but younger ones as well also fun to play a game that you grew up with that you can do the same with your own children as well.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey!!  This popular series is wonderful! Series one starts in 1912, with the sinking of the Titanic, Series Two continues into World War One.  The story line, acting and costumes are all superb. The series has a beautiful setting in an English house.  It is great!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey itself is wonderful, of course.  The DVDs came very quickly and were of good quality.  There were no skips or scratches and the sound and picture quality was good.
1451695195|5.0|This book is just what I expected.  It is interesting and well-written.  The subject is what most people would find interesting and informative.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book held my interest from start to finish.  THe characters were well developed and I loved seeing things from more than one perspective.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the app but it keeps crashing on my kindle. the app is way better than the first other than that one aspect. I do encourage buying this game but I'm tired of reinstalling it. Please fix this Imangi Studios :)
0321885112|5.0|A sketchnoted book on sketchnoting by acclaimed note taker Mike Rohde. Easily the best book on the subject. Be sure to get the video edition!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and I steal it from her all of the time. It's good to know that there are such talented musicians out there!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|really good game recommended for all people who are looking for the action of the adventures in different fields good game..
0525478817|5.0|I've read it thru 5 times and some parts a dozen times.  One moment I'm laughing, the next I'm crying, a couple of times both - at the same time!  I will love and cherish Hazel Grace and Augustus as long as I live as I hope to read it at least once a year for the rest of my life.  Thank you, John Green, for this wonderful, beautiful book.  It truly stole my heart.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I loved catching up on an episode I had missed and even better ,no commercials. Definitely the way to go!
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|My 7 year old loves this game.  It moves slow enough for him to think about what to do next, but fast enough to keep him entertained.  It is almost too easy for my almost 10 year old, but he enjoys it, too.  Great game for the young ones!
B003VR5PPY|1.0|This is the first negative review I have ever written for a product on Amazon, and I want to direct it at people who are buying this game for the story. While I will admit that the puzzle segments are enjoyable and quite challenging (I have a serious affinity for Room Escape games), the clear focus of this game is on its story, as a single playthrough will result in a maximum of 7-9 puzzle rooms before reaching one of six possible endings. The rest of the time spent is on the characters and the story. I will not spoil details, but I will say one thing pointedly: The \\"True Ending\\" of this game is one of the most insulting I have ever seen. I played the game through 4 times before I got the \\"True Ending\\" (2 of which are mandatory to reach it at all) and I honestly felt disrespected. The main character Junpei doesn't really have a whole lot of real individuality or character to him, because he is built almost exclusively to be the eyes and ears of the player. This is a common mechanic used in almost all room escape games and visual novels, and is not a problem on its own. However, what the game does with it IS the problem. The ending more or less (without spoiling anything) reveals a lot about the rest of the characters and why they're relevant to the plot, which is all very engrossing and riveting (genuinely). However, the final reveal about Junpei's character and how he is treated is more or less like a peg in a board. He's exploited by the game's REAL main characters (whom I won't reveal) for their own ends and, one can only assume, discarded just as swiftly since he does not appear in the sequel. Seeing as he is, as I stated, an AVATAR for the PLAYER, it's very hard to not feel used and discarded myself, after spending hours and hours trying to earn the ending that ultimately raised more questions than it answered and left the entire \\"relationship\\" scenario that the game set up drowning in the ocean, as it was all just an incredibly cheap red herring. If you want to see what I mean by all of my spoiler-free comments, then you should buy this game. But if you don't want to feel like the only way to justify your wasted time is to then pick up the sequel, just skip it. I wish I had.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I think this game is really fun, but after doing a few levels I kept failing and gave up. I switched levels and still couldn't pass any. Now, this might just be my lack of skill, but I don't play it much anymore because I know I will just get stuck. The overall concept is really fun though!
B009K45Y62|5.0|I purely bought this as a collectors item to add to the collectors trophy case!  It's a bit smaller than I thought, looking the pictures people have posted on the net so far, it looked big.  Nonetheless, it's still the best gift set from the TDK Trilogy.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|Before buying this unit, I did my homework. However, not much was written in previous reviews relating to my particular use. So, I decided to touch on it for future readers. I bought this unit primarily for getting guitar parts into Mixcraft 6. I run from my guitar, to a POD 2.0, to the 2i2, and into USB on my laptop. What I did not read about, is whether this would work without extensive problems like clipping, overload, etc. Rest assured... IT WORKS GREAT! There is absolutely no problem using either instrument or line in setting on the 2i2. I have the POD at about 50% output and the 2i2 inputs to the point where they just stay green when hitting the strings hard. Do not worry about too much signal coming into the 2i2 as referenced in other reviews, particularly reviews talking about guitars with humbuckers blowing the signal into unusable levels. I am playing stuff from hardcore metal crunch and grind, to blusey Strat licks, all the way down to acoustic strumming and plucking. So far, with the POD 2.0 between the guitar and the interface(and liklely other guitar effects processors)there is enough output control on the POD and enough input control on the 2i2, that I have very good, clean sound! VERY SATISFIED! For 5 stars, it would have to be free ;^)
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Incredibly well written story line.  A bit like Upstairs, Downstairs in the country.  Hated that Mathew is leaving the show (as well as Sybil)
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|I like the CD, I would not have bought it otherwise. I wish I didn't need to have some many words here.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Good movie just not as scary as I would have liked it to be or as graphic with the murders husband and I enjoyed it
B001NLKT60|4.0|I thought this book was great.  I liked the pacing more than the first book and the multiple story lines.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|People get angry when I compare Nickelback and Volbeat, but I'm going to do it anyways. Nickelback, for me, is a guilty pleasure. They certainly know how to crank out the powerful, rhythmic songs that have a way to get stuck in your head. But there is just something about the vocals that just don't work. Volbeat, on the other hand, takes the best qualities of genre-mashing groups like Nickelback and improves upon their failures.<br /><br />That said, this album is simply spectacular. Catchy riffs and powerful vocals give this album with a certain allure that will appeal to listeners who prefer strong male vocals. It also appeals to those looking for great drumming that drives the pace of the whole album. There is no particular element of rock music that is lacking here. Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood is one of the greatest modern rock albums available.
B008FYZIVY|1.0|I gave this to my parents as a gift and while the first season DVDs work great the second season doesn't play at all.  I've tried it in multiple DVD players all with the same result.  I even exchanged the first set of DVDs with Amazon and the second set does the same thing.  Buyers beware.
B007PKDW44|5.0|This album is slammed pack with powerful riffs and charging drum runs. To me, the sound draws from classic rock and roll, southern rock, the best of metal, and some punk influence as well. This album is the best of all of those worlds. This album is truly one of the best albums of the year. It's an aural onslaught you'll certainly enjoy.
0765325950|5.0|The long wait is over, and I couldn't ask for a more satisfying and exciting conclusion to the saga.  Recommended!
B006CQLGXG|4.0|Love the story and this is a fun version complete with illustrations. Great read. Totally recommend it for anyone that loves this classic tale.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Great story, tremendous acting.  The best stuff on TV is on paid cable, but if you don't want to subscribe to Showtime, this is a great way to go.  I can't wait for the second season to come out.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Have you ever wanted to make stick men do more than just exist.? Well here ya go a preset game experience where you draw the character and the items you need to use. I fell in love the first 5 minuets and have been using it to kill time ever sense.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|The movie.......to sum it up...........was cheesy!  That may have been what they were going for, but still.  It amazed me they had so many great actors, but still accomplished nothing.
1449410243|5.0|If you love Cats you need this book. Cats the plotters of our demise has been brought to a very humorous forefront in The oatmeals newest book. I haven't laughed os hard in a while. Not for the kiddies.
B0031GUR44|5.0|I noticed in some of the other reviews that this was not in fact a set of 2 (& apparently had I complained I would get a 2nd one for free). I believe the &#34;Set of 2&#34; text was used as a default as most wiper blade products are sold in pairs (left & right), but since this is a rear wiper blade it is sold as a single. The mistake in the description aside, this blade went onto my 2007 VW GTI flawlessly and does the job it's meant to do, no complaints here.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|This add on works really well with the kinect in a limited space, especially for Kinect 2 player modes.  The only thing is that due to the way these add-on lenses adjust the Kinect's view, the Kinect should be located under the TV (just a few feet off the floor).  For those who prefer to mount the Kinect above the TV (similar to the old Wii sensor bar), you'll likely have some issues.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|I love the wit and originality of this film.  It has a great balance of humor and intensity throughout the whole thing.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books have a great story line. I read all 3 books in 3 days. I could not put it down. Once you start reading these books you get sucked in. I would recommend this book to anyone. I even got my mom to read them.
B00002DEQQ|5.0|Been trying to find this, (since this concert was in UK) and I'm so glad I found it!  I already had the Reloaded CD which was released here in U.S., and this just completed the set.  It once again is amazing Tom singing his heart out brillantly, and the songs are newer and you can tell what fun he and his band are having.  A definately great CD, I recommend buying it!
B002BSHXJA|2.0|I just received-and immediately played- a copy of the Rubber Soul CD I bought from<br />an Amazon seller who advertised it as being from the Mono Box Set. The CD was sealed<br />in plastic  by a thin adhesive strip on the back-so far so good. The Beatles'<br />photo on the front of the CD, however, is a poor reproduction of the original, and<br />the song titles on the back are printed so small I almost need a magnifying glass<br />to read them! The CD itself says 'Made in Japan', and the title, Rubber Soul, is<br />partly obscured by the circular ridge around the center hole.<br /> Then there's the sound quality: hollow at best, and the channel separation that<br />exists on the stereo version of R.S. is still there!<br /> So here's my question: Counterfeit, or no?  Or are the Mono Box Set CD's all<br />'Made in Japan', and do the genuine copies all match the descriptions I've given?<br />Thank you!
B001IBIQU6|1.0|This album sounds like a kid experimenting with the new synthesizer her got for Christmas in 1982.  Random electronic sounds aren't music.  Don't waste your time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is always fun to read a book and be swept away in the suspense of what is really happening.  Although the ending wasn't a complete surprise, it was always one of the possibilities that I considered might be happening.
1451695187|5.0|A peek into the previously unknown condition we call death!  I am in a place to welcome this subject since I am facing my own mortality with  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis!  I found this quite interesting and believable as the subject and author is a practicing Neuro-surgeon!!  He and his cohorts are usually the scoffers with subjects like this.  He tells the story in a compellingly interesting and believable way.  I have seen him speak of these events on TV!!  Beyond (WAY) the norm and is unapologetic about any of his experience and understanding of this incredible experience he had!!!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this for my brother and can't believe the deal I got.  It looks even better than the picture.  It's a Seiko, so you know the quality is there  The packaging/presentation is great. Very classy.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|What to say.... A fantastic knife!  After careful reviews and deciding I finally found the knife for me!  This thing is huge!  Make no mistake.... And not in the sense of a 9 inch or 12 inch blade.  This thing is WIDE.  Balance is a bit off due to its size and weight but that makes no difference to me.  Pictures and videos do not do this blade an justice whatsoever.  This is truly a solid knife built to take abuse and perservere no matter what the challenge is.  AND it is American made!  Get one you will not regret it!

B008AK8FHM|3.0|I am at an age (77) where there have been events in my lifetime that have been surprising and not reasonable at the time.  Such as voices telling me what to do, or warning me of events.  Most of which I followed and found the voice to be true.  But it all is still a mystery to  me on how it happens and where it comes from.
B000I9W08I|5.0|A rare look at Walter Matthau who is great in this movie, who knew he could sing.... and Barbara, well she is unbeatable...her voice, her timing, her sarcasm.....I really enjoyed it and hope others will too,

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat! I had heard that it was good but I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I highly recommend it.
B0055S348W|4.0|The cover fits perfectly, just point out that the buttons are a little hard. I recommend buying this product. When on a smooth surface now sounds much more the speaker.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|good, fun game!....but the only problem is once you play it and open it, it wont let you play it anymore. fun, exciting game if it works.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing and is very addictive , you will love it . I suggest that every one go install it.
B00933JL0A|5.0|...And that issue is that after some time, I see a small (I mean small) Ad go flying down the screen, trying to hit your finger. And handy-games, Make it so that you can pay to stop the ads on the game itself please.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is a great time passer. I like that you can change how many pieces the puzzles are to make them easier or more difficult. You start out with a good variety of puzzles and then you can get more.I was worried when I first got this that I would get done with the puzzles they gave me and be bored with it but when I finally decided to check out the get more puzzles option , which is right there for you, I found there are even more puzzle categories you can get for free yea free. Each category comes with 3-5 different puzzles too. Now there are also a lot of categories that they want money for but some I checked out were only $.99 and had 9-12 different puzzles in the category and you can preview the category without buying if you don't like what you see or if your just not ready to buy. I seen reviews when I got this that people were having trouble with their puzzles disappearing so I haven't bought any yet I've just been busy enough with all the free ones still but if I do buy any ill make sure I do those as soon as possible so if they do disappear I hopefully will already have completed them.<br />UPDATE: I am still playing this for free and loving it I play all the time when I'm not busy or if I'm waiting for appointments. I've gotten over 50 puzzles so far I have deleted the ones I don't want to do again but I haven't had any disappear on me without deleting them. I am considering buying a set of 60 in one for $1.99 but I have to admit that the reason I haven't yet is because of the reviews saying that one's they paid for disappear but I think I'm going to try it anyway I'm hoping the update that did that to the other reviewers fixed that so it won't happen again. If not 60 puzzles should keep me busy for another month or so and if they do happen to disappear it's only two bucks it's worth the test I  guess lol.I will be sure to let everyone know how it goes in another update, it might be a month or two before I update again to be sureof the results (sooner if they do disappear ;) )
0525478817|5.0|I'll admit it.  I did not believe I would love The Fault In Our Stars.  Yes, I'd read all of the rave reviews.  But a book about kids dying of cancer?  And not only would I love this book, but it was going to make me laugh, too?  Well, this doubting Thomas is here to tell you that my answers are a very emphatic YES and YES.<br /><br />\\"Cancer books suck.\\"  So says sixteen year-old Hazel, the wise beyond her years narrator of The Fault In Our Stars, and a cancer...victim?  No, she does not view herself as a victim.  Sufferer?  That doesn't seem quite right, either, because she's focused more on living than on the suffering that comes with cancer.  Cancer survivor?  I think she'd roll her eyes at anything that attempted to add a false feel-good tone to her certain-to-be short-lived life.  So I'll go with this - Hazel is a girl who happens to have cancer.  She views her cancer through realistic, but never bitter or self-pitying eyes.  As Hazel says, \\"Even cancer isn't a bad guy really: cancer just wants to be alive.\\"<br /><br />When we meet Hazel, she is attending a support group for kids with cancer.  She attends  the group to appease her parents, not herself; she views it as a major nuisance, at best.  All the talk of death, the discussions of feelings and fears - Hazel wants none of it.  But then she meets Augustus, a newcomer to the group.  He's missing a leg, but he's got looks and charm to spare, and he immediately intrigues Hazel.<br /><br />You will be in love with Hazel before you've finished the first ten or twenty pages.  And you will root for this young couple, even though you know one or both of their lives are doomed.<br /><br />One of the many heart-breaking aspects of this book is the suffering of her parents.  I don't have children, but I know there cannot be anything worse in this world than watching your child die.  In Hazel's case, the watching and waiting has gone on for several years.  Her father cannot participate in a discussion regarding Hazel's cancer without sobbing, and her mother has given up her own life to take care of Hazel's.  As much sympathy and love as Hazel has for them, she occasionally gets angry.  She lashes out at her mother and pleads with her to find something else to do besides taking care of a dying daughter.  After all, once Hazel is gone, what will remain for her mother?<br /><br />OK, that was a lot of dark stuff, and I promised you some humor.  How about these two gems?<br /><br /> - Augustus expressed outrage that a 13 year-old Hazel used her \\"Make a Wish\\" on a trip to Disney World.  Hazel knew it was lame, but softened the blow by adding that she went to Epcot, too.<br /> - Hazel's friend, Kaitlyn, when discussing Augustus: \\"I would ride that one-legged pony all the around the corral.\\"<br /><br />The romance between Hazel and Augustus is one of the most beautful I've ever read.  So much so that I happily overlooked the fact that their dialogue was unlike any that I've ever heard from any teenager (or most adults, for that matter.)<br /><br />I kept waiting and waiting for the moment that I would need tissues.  I thought I had the outcome nailed early on, based on what I thought was a subtle \\"clue,\\" but I was wrong.  We're pulled along to what we believe is the inevitable conclusion until the inevitable gets flipped on its head.  And yes, then it was tissue time.<br /><br />On a personal note, I visited Amsterdam and the Anne Frank House a year and a half ago.  I climbed those same, steep narrow steps in the house that Hazel climbed, hauling her oxygen tank with her.  Everything that she described brought back intense memories.  If you get the chance to visit Amsterdam, the House is a must-see.s cancer without sobbing, and her mother has given up her own life to take care of Hazel's.

B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This book was a great read. Suspense from beginning to end. I strongly recommend this debut to anyone who is in to fantasy. You won't be disappointed.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|So, I have always loved Tina Fey. She was great on SNL and 30 Rock is still one of my all-time favorite shows. My favorite thing about this book is it's written exactly the way she talks! Her down-to-earth/sarcastic tone comes across and her side comments about life are simply hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at so many moments that I decided I could not read my Kindle in public because people were looking at me funny. :) I truly hope she writes another book at some point - really don't care about what - but it's bound to be just as funny and insightful as this one. I highly recommend Bossypants!
0988262592|5.0|The Phoenix Project is a fascinating book which takes you through a story about a painful IT department from its problems and failures to gradual improvement to triumph.  This is an instructive book wrapped in an interesting novel complete with intrigue and villains.  I read The Goal in college and find many similarities both with the approach of laying out the information and the concepts which are introduced.  Bill is a great protagonist and by the end I was really rooting for him and his team to succeed.<br /><br />This book is well written, attention getting and educational all in one neat package.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend it for those in IT and those who work with IT to help spark ideas for improving the system.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I found it difficult to tear myself away from this novel even for short periods of time. My thoughts, anger, disbelief and horror kept returning to the characters and the pain endured under the guise of righteousness. The setting is compelling as it envelops the human activities, complimenting not distracting from the lives of those involved.<br />The story is basically of two women, strangers at first, who live in isolation despite the many others within their reach - two lives, yet so much the same. Their meeting creates, in time, a new world for themselves, no better than the previous, but with insight as to the possibility of a future in their wartime country complete with air raids and savage military treatment. I will remember A Thousand Splendid Suns for a long time to come.  [[ASIN:B00BHF7PDM Vicky Banning]][[ASIN:B00B77TDEY Minnie]]
0374275637|3.0|The core of the book describes the findings of Tversky-Kahneman \\"team\\", experiments and discussions in the psychology of human thinking, classifying many types of faults.<br />These findings had a very strong impact, Kahneman was awarded the Novel prize in Economics in 2002 (unfortunately Tversky died in 1996).<br />The book succeeds in presenting the findings of the \\"team\\", and related works, in a fluent, clear and precise style, without the rigid conventions of scientific publications. Many illuminating examples and personal stories are interspersed in the text.<br />The weakness of the book stems from its misleading title - \\"Fast\\" and \\"Slow\\" systems of thinking are associated to the findings of the \\"team\\". These associations are strained, unfounded, without theoretical or experimental basis: even the slow heavy system is exposed to most of the thinking faults the \\"team\\" catalogued; while strong psychological confrontations occur inside the \\"fast\\" thinking system, in case its heuristics reactions pull into contradictory directions.<br />Moreover, the book practically ignores fundamental issues concerning \\"fast\\" and \\"slow\\" systems: how heuristics are learned and acquired by humans in everyday life, by expert craftsmen, by performing and creating artists. It ignores the findings and experiments of the behavioristic school (Thorndike, Skinner and others), and also modern topics in Statistical-Computational Learning Theory.<br />The findings of the \\"team\\" are already classical tools in the arsenal of Cognitive Psychology and Experimental Economics. Hence, most of the discussion should relate to the weaknesses in the novel claims the book makes about the \\"fast\\" and \\"slow\\" systems. Clearly these are debatable, which should make the reading of the book and the discussions around it more interesting and useful.

B002C949KE|1.0|The basic premise is an interesting one, although the author goes to torturous lengths to make this basically short story into a book-length manuscript.  One can get whip-lash trying to followed the scattered train of thought.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fast fun challenging game. The developers also created scenes that change every month and have new challenges so it keeps the game fresh. I wish there were more games like this. All skill levels can play and improve as they play!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Great music and if you like Emmy Rossum, then you will love this new album.  She has such a beautiful voice and having another variety of her music is WONDERFUL.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This has to be one of the best series ever written. You are hooked after the first episode.  Make yourself some popcorn and get ready to be entertained!  Worthy of all their emmy nods!
098478280X|4.0|Despite many employers now actively avoiding questions from these books, it gives you a great overview of all those algorithms that you've probably not really used since University.<br />Some great advice on interview prep, negotiating and other things that are of use.<br />Recommended.
B001F12J48|2.0|3-d is misleading and in my excitement to watch 3d movies on my new tv I did not see the statment that you must use blue/red glasses in movie.  Well don't have - so useless.  Love polar express and already have regular dvd so will just give this away to someone who would like a copy of regular dvd which is included.  3d is misleading and I need to be more careful in the future.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Loved every part of the book - from accelerated learning techniques, to catching a pigeon for food.<br />Covers the whole spectrum of learning to cook, as well as how/where you food comes from.<br /><br />Important lessons and information are inside; do yourself a favour and read this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I bought that it was a decent game just wish it was easyier to accumulate moremoney so that you can get more games to play.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Can't beat the price for a must have blu-ray collection.  Every tech movie buff needs this on their shelf.  Awesome!!
B0024FADAQ|3.0|This was a gift to a family member and I don't have any first hand information as to its quality.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think the 3rd book was my favorite.  It helps open your eyes to what else is out in the world.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great way to spend some down time.  Easy to learn and time goes by quickly.  A classic that translates well to the Kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. It was fabulous. No more words except that. I love the hunger games trilogy so much! It's fabulous
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Chino has a knack for blending aggressive, heavy guitars with haunting, almost surreal sounding vocals. 95% of the vocals are sung as apposed to screeched (which I prefer). Check out \\"Saturday night wrist\\" and \\"diamond eyes\\" if you dig the overall less aggressive sound this album offers. Their sound has matured since their ultra aggressive early albums (they're good too). This album offers more melody and less aggression. My wife (can u say phillip phillips) doesn't even complain when I play this album. At the time of this writing, the mp3 album is only $4.99! I paid double that and don't mind a bit. Highly recommended!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I was thrilled to find this at such a low price compared to other hard to find copies of this Disney animated film. I was thrilled to find a copy at all, after searching local stores. Shipped on time. Packed well. It's all good.
B0086700CM|5.0|well its is fun I audriel always want to play a game that you can move thus game is fun as I said
B001O1O71C|5.0|Good book it was shocking and a medium length book. It was British so some word I didn't understand some.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My whole family loves this game,  from my 3 year old to my 13 year old to me (40), we're always counting down the days to the next city.
6304806418|5.0|This movie was beautifully depicted by Madonna and Antonio Bandaras.  Music was outstanding.  Item was received in excellent condition. Thank you Amazon.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this music. Found out about her on YouTube and just can't stop listening to her music. Very original, give it a try.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire last night and couldn't quit playing it.  It's fun to watch the balls drop when you hit the right spot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has a ton of fun options. I have never experienced such a fun game to play! Everyone should play the game!
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|If you like napping this is a great movie.  From the Slow slow slow begining where I actually just about did fall asleep in the theatre this movie is nothing but fight, run, fight, run, fight, run..On DVD or streaming it will be much better since you can now fast forward and cut the movie in half which is what the director should have done.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|That was ok but it needed pictures too well I would think so but it was good to I liked it a  lot too me though in my perspective or point  of view . So that was ok though as I thought though.
B009K86D86|4.0|Great watch, but watch it with your brain on! Don't just believe everything you see, question it all. When you see the part about the family that buys fast food and then can't afford real food, that's questionable. Like it though.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So very calming, I love the cavern and campfire put with wind rain and thunder!! This is by far the best sleep app I have seen in a while! Good job!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Great movie for a guys night! it's funny and well thought out! I recommend it for a good relaxing time away from the kids.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|The product came much earlier than I expected and it works just fine.  Great movie, seen it several times since arriving.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played! So addicting and so fun! Everything about this ggame sucks you in, be prepared to never stop playing. You wont regret getting it.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Got a great deal for this new copy and it arrived on time.  It doesn't get any better than Dexter.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great book!  I enjoyed this book very much.  The Sparks books are favorites and I have shared them with others.Dora
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched season 1 when snowed in. Got hooked. Couldn't wait to watch season 2 and 3. Can't wait to watch next year.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Just started, great so far.  I have read all the reviews and have been impressed, can't wait to finish it Dora
1476712042|4.0|Quick easy read. Cant wait for second book. I really enjoyed the characters story, and it was pretty well written
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the sample will begin reading it soon. I am anxious to geg through this book,have also recommend it to others. Dora
B009329Y30|5.0|Very good movie with a good story line like all of Nicholas Spark's books.  Enjoyed it very much!  Thanks.a lot.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After deliberating between getting another mouse or keeping the ones I have, I decided to get this mouse because of the reviews and also because I found out that it had one of the best and latest sensors (Avago ADNS-9800). Why should I spend potentially $100 dollars on a gaming mouse when this has the same technology and even additional usage capabilities?<br />After receiving this mouse it took some time for me to get accustom to it but I have retired both my 2012 black deathadder and my corsair m60 for back up and now solely use this mouse to play my fps games. It has gone way beyond my expectation for the price. The mouse can be as accurate as you want if you adjust your Windows and software sensitivity accordingly. With the nine buttons, you can map any key to a keyboard button, macro an action, or make any button become assigned to an in-gameuse. This was a plus for me. It was the steelseeries sensei or this.<br /><br />I do agree with a previous post about the mouse feet feeling and looking cheap. After this was pointed out,  I must say that I agree. They are almost flush with the outer layers of the area where the feet are. It would have been nice if they were raised a bit or made differently. Maybe Anker should provide extra feet next time. Who knows.<br />Overall, this mouse has performed beyond my expectation and performance is more important to me than cosmetics so 5/5. Software is a breeze, braided cable is good with adequate length, and added weights makes this mouse a must-have for avid and casual gamers alike.
0060987464|4.0|This not very happy, it's not written to make you think Manson is a good person. His  childhood wasn't happy and it won't really end on a note that provides closure. Much like his music the movie can provide you with some pretty intense imagery, but after the shock value of some of his statements has worn off your left with someone who is pretty insightful about himself and others and you realize how much deeper the rabbit hole goes.<br />I listen to some of Manson's music but not a lot of it, I had to read this book for a college and it was enlightening and I think I like Manson so much more now then I did before, if for no other reason then this book makes you understand how much his music really means to him. Is he a good person? No. Does he know that? Yes. I think this book gives you a good look at what goes on in the minds of some of the people society has tried to disassociate from as much as possible and I don't think that is ever a bad thing.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|My favorite aspect of the game is the tilt features. I'm still relatively new to owning a kindle and so tilting and turning the device around to move is way awesome to me. The game play is entertaining. It's not to hard, but not always to simple either. All in all, a nice game to kill some time.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|the movie is more about the human drama then the plane crash. Not action packed but I really got into the man and how alcohol made him lose everything
B008X9Z37A|3.0|It is good for the price, and it serves its purpose. But I thought it was a bit softer. And there are no holes for the speakers, but I can still  hear the sound. So far it is kind of okay
B003O86FMW|5.0|Seriously, I just finished it a second time and I DO NOT read books more than once. Just trust that it is worth the read
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Good music to sing too any time. Heard the Song Home and decided to buy the entire edition and I am glad I did.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very accurate and helpful. Happy with the download! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a weather app. Easy layout
B00BGD07KS|5.0|MC delivers awesome vocals here; singing in full voice. Fantastic soundtrack cut. A stone winner!  Would love to see her perform this live on American Idol this season!
0761169253|5.0|Really great book! If you are an artist or creative really great to find inspiration and be positive about your own work. I recomended this book to everyone
B007KW5N9Y|3.0|This is a very strange movie. It is obviously high budget, given the size of the pre-CGI sets, the number of extras, and the use of real military craft.<br /><br />But it is such a strange movie. Christian Bale does a fine job of acting in this film (it's uncanny seeing features in young Christian that I recognize in the adult Christian Bale), but still, he's a 12 year old kid who is prone to doing 12 year old kid stuff. He lives in a Japanese concentration camp during the war. You see lots of suffering and cruelty with no vengeance or payback. People endure beatings and don't fight back, don't try to get revenge. It's just suffering and then more suffering, starvation, death, and arbitrary violence.<br /><br />Spielberg brings some clever camera angles to the table, and given the source material it is well-made, well scripted, and well-acted, but I really don't see how this was a good idea as a movie. It's just that the central structure of the story simply doesn't lend itself to commercial success or popular appeal. An interesting novel, maybe even a short A&E mini-series, but a high-budget feature-length movie?
B004E9CFZG|5.0|I had to purchase this as I missed it on TV, and wanted to catch up. It was great; downloaded fine and of good quality.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|So glad to have this app.  It is truly 3D, and becomes a brain flowing activity.  Beautiful colors and designs, music is all right.  Great visual fun.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|A worthy prequel to The Maze Runner. Some quality characters that give you plenty of excitement and a lot of hope.
B005LHOKFS|2.0|I got this app for my Kindle Fire HD. It definitely is not the same as using a desktop version through the web. I love the desktop web version, but disappointed on version that I got for my Kindle
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The author kept my interest and even though at times the words were a bit confusing, the story unfolded from sad to happy. I cried, felt Jaime·s depression, and in the end, his joy. Loved this novel.
B008XG1X18|4.0|My daughter turned me on to this site. I am new to Pinterest but like it so far and look forward to using it more!
1419701533|5.0|I bought this set for my classroom, but found them very funny.  I could relate even as a 34 year old female.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Hard to put down. You can learn the game just by watching the opening, and that's rare for a chess game. I really like it; I've even won a couple of games.
B0054JURZA|5.0|Bon Iver is a very unique sound, and is definitely &#34;headphones&#34; music. If you listen to the song clips and are intrigued, then chances are you'll quickly love this album and will enjoy it on random occasions for years. If you think it sounds boring or doesn't suit you, that's fine too, it's not a big deal.
B000AHJJDM|4.0|I was so happy when I got this vinyl. I've been wanting this one for a while and I am thankful for finally owning it. Love listening to it. Of course a great buy. Unfortunately, &#34;I Will Follow You Into The Dark&#34; skipped four times. That's obviously the last song you want to skip but all the songs are great. Those skips on that song just ruin it though and that really sucks.
0205313426|5.0|I wish this book were required reading for every English-speaking person on the planet. Reading even the first 2 pages of this book, let alone the rest of it, would answer so many people's eternal uncertainties about how to write even basic sentences properly. This is the most economical and valuable book on writing available, as has been true for decades.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|If you have read other authors regarding the wars  in Afghanastan and the area this isn't much difference than others.  If you military and want to know about different types of weapons there is a whole chapter devoted to it.  I found it rather much the same as other books on this topic with the usual gunho appetite for battle.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I love the case and plan on using it, but not on an everyday basis. I was excited to receive this case and put my phone in it the minute I got it, but was disappointed to realize how simple the case is. Not only that but the bottom of the screen where the keyboard is, is really loose and I have to press kind of hard in order to type. I will use it when I am at a pool or the beach, but other than that it will stay in my draw.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Torchwood is an incredible spin off of the amazing Dr. Who universe surrounding Captain Jack Harkness and his crew.<br />The story is just awesome and gets better and better and more in depth as it progresses throughout the seasons.<br />If you are a fan of Dr. Who then I absolutely recommend watching this along with it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|For a movie that starts out claiming to be true story it turns out it was more fiction than fact.  I am sorry to say it but Ben Afflick's performance was as emotionless as a stone.  I do think the tension was built up well but it was eveyone knew how the story was going to end.  I would like to have seen more on the reasons why the people of Iran hate us.  A better story would have been about the role of the US and Iran under the Shah. I think the Arkin/Goodman were very good.  I also thought the debate between the hostages was very well done.  All in all the movie is predictable a simple gimic movie about using a movie as a means of accomplishing something important.  Wag the Dog repeat.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I enjoyed becca's role. Comfortable with herself not easily influenced. The commentary judges were funny. They could have elaborated on why becca's roommate was racist. The throwup scene was funny but a bit too graphic for me. Overall great competition story.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is ok for about the first half. After that, you almost can predict what will happen next, to a certain extent. Some things are shocking.I just bought it to see what everyone was talking about.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I loved this movie because it takes a look at a very real problem for many older couples.  It's just something that they don't talk about.  I think it will definitely be appreciated by the &#34;older set&#34; who can relate.  It was well acted.  Meryl Streep is such a wonderful actress.  She is so believable.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Once I got used to his writing style and format, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I would read it again.
B000ID37T0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, especially the soundtrack and Al Pacino's performance. He definitely deserved his Oscar! I would recommend this film to anyone who can enjoy a fine film.
B005CWRB44|5.0|This little light is awesome. I'm an ICU nurse, and have to use a flashlight every day for multiple reasons. This light on its lowest intensity setting is perfect for what do. The other nice part is that it &#34;sits&#34; on it's flat base and acts as a diffuse candle. If you are looking for a spot-beam, this isn't it. But for what I use it for, its wider, diffuse beam is perfect!
B005PK5C12|3.0|Just as the title says, the first season of American Horror Story started so strong, and stayed that way for more than half the season, but it really just sputtered to the end. To be honest, I do not even think the final episode was necessary. It just kind of started to drag and limp after eight or so episodes and by the end you may find yourself just wondering why hasn't it ended already!  Because it stays strong for nearly 3/4 of the season, 3 out of 5 stars.  Ultimately, a rather disappointing finish.
0788859544|5.0|Thank you so much for such a great condition dvd. Im pleased!! even the edges on the case is perfect.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very good book.  It gives a great insight into the training required to become a SEAL sniper and how they deal with stress of combat and the reality of killing your targets.  Chris Kyle also intersperses commentary from his wife to give her perspective.  Coincidentally, I was half way through this book when the news broke about his untimely death.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So easy to use and the let's are so big no making mistakes. I use it all the time at work and at home.
B005IQZB14|5.0|great  description  of  overcoming  adversity.  honest  depiction  of  her life.  incredible  detail  of  treacherous  journey  of hiking  pacific coast trail.  amazing  accomplishment.  very  exciting to read.
B0068MNNOE|5.0|What a great movie. An eye opener. I stumbled upon this movie at the library and had to order it.
0061743526|1.0|How is this not available on Kindle!  I have to buy this for my son to read for school.  If it wasn't for that I say forget Harper Lee!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Basic calculator does just what you need it to. Simple and easy to use. A great app for anyone to have.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really liked this book!! I couldn't put it down, it had me guessing all the way up to the end and it had me hooked from the start. I saw the movie 2 days later and I must say I was disappointed, the movie didn't give nearly the same amount of back story. But overall another great one done by Sparks.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is fantastic you don't have to spend money. In fact it's more fun if you don't so you feel like you earned the things you have. This game is great and it keeps on going when you're not there
0741470314|5.0|A must for any MJ Fan.  It's not perfect, doesn't include everything, but what book does? If you are a real fan, this is a must-have for your MJ library! You'll read things you haven't read elsewhere.
B00004U8P9|5.0|The picture is amazing and I love the movie.. This is one of my all time favorite movies.. Totally worth the price..
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Loved season 3 Just didn't like when he died on the day the baby was born need more happiness! Sister needs to stop picking wrong men!!!
0634089358|5.0|This is one great book to learn Many useable blues licks and walks from.It is so enjoyable to practice from, you dont even feel like your practicing because its so much fun.You start playing cool blues music right from the start. If you want to become a better Bass player buy this book. You will learn alot while having fun doing so!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is the most wonderful christmas present I received. Although my wonderful husband bought the wrong sized case and I lost my first stylus, I could not be happier. I like this better than the original Kindle I brought because I don't have to push the pages with the clicker - going to give that to my daughter.The stylus also works on my phone!
B0018RC7QE|5.0|Heartwarming and yet sad. I enjoyed it. It was just simply genuine. I would guess some wouldn't find it exciting enough but others would enjoy it for its simplicity.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a Great Movie! I think all the performers did an excellent job with their characters. The movie flows well and keeps you entertained.
B009H2PCNC|5.0|He never fails to surprise. On this set, Eno is back to form with seemingly simple sounds that form such complex melodies. Not sure how he does it, but this is a nice addition to his oeuvre.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I was hooked by the first paragraph.  And it just kept getting better, funnier, and more clever with every page.  An absolutely great read. I'm sorry it had to end but just like the bible &#34; They all lived happily everafter&#34;.
B00B0NDF26|4.0|Just about every trick of the 80's girl groups - synths, snappy vocals...the works - is pulled out and enjoyably exploited in this CD.  Don't get me wrong, some of the 80's girl groups were really good, but it was an unexpected installment with Tegan and Sara.  It reminded me of what would have happened if Carole Pope & Rough Trade, who used to put out such great New Wave-with-a-brain music, had suddenly been rolled up with Katrina and the Waves' Walking on Sunshine style.  The good news is that Tegan and Sara pulled it off very well and made an enjoyable, light CD that is listenable, likeable and always fresh no matter how many times I play it.  I liked their earlier works as well so I guess that makes me a fan no matter what (so far).  It will be interesting to see what they deliver next and what market segment is their next buyer.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|This is an excellent debut collection, which truly showcases WHY Phillip Phillips stood out among the other contestants.  He has that indefinable quality often referred to as &#34;IT&#34; and although seeing him perform live is preferred, this is the next best thing.  I predict a long and successful career.  Recommended.
0307346617|4.0|Good read.  i enjoyed it.  The interview style was an interesting way to tell the story.  It will be interesting to see how some of the scenes will be included and handled in the film.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I gave it four stars purely for the story. I always felt that the Green Arrow was the freckle faced redheaded step child of DC Comics. But given a chance Ollie grows on you and this series has had the same effect. The writing started to get into the &#34;Twilightish angst&#34; mode, but the last two episodes (14 and 15) seem to found itself again with the actual story of Arrow. I am looking forward to the 2nd season.
B00BL5YQKS|3.0|Acting:  5 stars<br />Family Friendliness: 1 star<br />Story line:  5 star<br />Christian Friendliness:  1 star<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Shield is a program that I would not feel comfortable watching with most people.  It is just too raw (realistic but raw)
B008IBPMZG|5.0|ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, cable, satellite streams, etc... - suffer the effects of Public Indoctrination.<br />Once upon a time, we had schools.<br />Schools required reading, writing, and math.<br />They were far less concerned about what you thought, - and, noticeably focused on enabling you to think for yourself.<br />Now, those buildings formerly known as schools - are simple day care centers.<br />They serve breakfast and lunch.<br />They contain and restrain their victims for the basic 6 hours.<br />Then they continue to amuse for another 3 or 4 more in the afternoon.<br />God forbid that parents have to deal with their spawn for more than an hour or two a day.<br /><br />This as resulted in America's fascination with what is ironically referred to as &#34;reality TV.&#34;<br />This is possibly the most moronic term is use today.<br />The shows have nothing to do with reality - possibly less to do with entertainment.<br />Yet, simple minded Americans will stay glued in front of them for days (in a daze.)<br />The bonus for the networks/providers is that they cost ritually nothing to produce.<br />They are this generation's cash-cow for television.<br />It all hinges on producing a viewing audience that can be fascinated by watching paint dry.<br />Thank you, secretary of education.<br /><br />Downton Abby is, in effect, Anti-Reality TV.<br />It has a plot. - go figure.<br />It has a script (aka screen play), which is literate, complex, thought provoking, and purposeful - supporting said plot.<br />It has period costumes.<br />It has period technologies (transportation, telegraphs, telephones, etc.)<br />It has period laws, morals, social strains and stresses of the time.<br />It has sets.

0062183591|4.0|I have read most of Dan's books. He is a fun author. I don't feel it necessary to write a detailed review because anything complimentary I say may come across as dishonest. His books are clear and easily understood. Highly suggested reading.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Title says it all. I love this movie, plain and simple.  For somebody who grew up on the video games this movie draws inspiration from, and a lover of Edgar Wright films, this film is an absolute treat.
0374275637|4.0|An easily understood explanation of how our mind decides. Some areas of writing were mildly confounding (I’m not as educated as Mr. Kahneman and I had difficulty grasping a few terms and examples), but most of the material is explained in ways that a layman can understand. Well worth reading.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I would consider giving this book to any High School student and above<br />Good- quick read<br />I am reading additional books by C Hoover
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would have liked a little bit more romance towards the end which ended a bit too abrutly for me.<br />-Jose's wife. :-)

B006X5L6VS|1.0|This app does not work to auto navigate the stars on any Kindle device! I found out after buying thr app and its extra data pack app after reading some other reviewers post saying that the app works on the Kindle HD 8.9. Well that reviewer was full of it and probably shill selling the app. This app also is flaky as heck too. The screen jumps all over the place and is hard to manually manipulate your desired location. The small control icons at the top corners of the screen dont always respond too. Amazon should not have allowed this shaky app on their app store! I thought the whole purpose of their own proprietary app store was to ensure all their apps would be100% reliable and working! This app is not 100% working for any Kindle device! At least they should offer this half baked app for free. I  really would like a refund of my $2.00 just as a matter of principle. I regret this foolish purchase.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|It will pass the time. I had nothing better to do.  Would not want to see it again anytime soon.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This book is excellent. I just cant stop reading it. :-) everyone has a very unique personality in the book, and like Richard the most.  I have finished 90% of the book, wondering if he has the chance to meet his Grash again.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I enjoyed his style of writing and also learning more about medevial times. I went on to read his other books.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This series makes you think. The characters are complex & the story line is complex and surprising! Love the parallel universes slight, yet fun differences.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Seems like the purpose of the movie was Hollywood's attempt to resurrect Jimmy Carter's failed presidency.  Carter's henchmen wanted to pull the plug on the whole operation except for the determination of Ben Affleck's hard driving character.<br /><br />Love the voice over at movie's end where former President Carter tells us everything came out alright in the end as &#34;we&#34; rescued all the hostages.  The inconvenient truth is that he failed in his boggled operation to rescue the other hostages and only when President Reagan was sworn in did the Iranians release them without any military or covert action.<br /><br />History will not be revised by this movie.  This was the best movie of the year?

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can't think of anything that could really be done to improve this app. There are occasional glitches that make the screen go from one to another when the menu bar is open is all.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|this is a great way to keep my thoughts to my self so that no one can read them, just remember to keep it password protected.

B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I like to read a wide range of books and I can't afford to pay a lot of money and this way I can afford to read a lot and inprove my mind. It is a great app.
