B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app but I would like to see more versions available for offline usage. Especially NASB and NIV. This is not a criticism just a high recommendation.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great and fun app. I can work on puzzles without having to worry about my kids taking the puzzle pieces.
B0016OOS16|4.0|I bougth this because I need somenthing for my lap, I enjoy everithing... when work, my alienware MX11 not have a cd drive, so I spend 1 hour turning my desktop and coping the file to a usb, and when I try to install the driver, the software sent me to internet for the latest driver!!!, so installation disk in 64 bits is useless. otherwise is perfect!!!
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Very disappointing.  Pedestrian goo-fest. Loved Alien, but this was the most-expensive dumbest movie I think I've ever seen. All these supposedly smart characters act like the camping teenagers in B horror flicks. &#34;Oh, there's breathable air in here on this alien planet?  Let's all take our helmets off...nah, I'm sure there aren't any alien germs or anything...&#34;  &#34;Yes, I'm the crack biologist hired on this trillion-dollar mission, but let me just touch this writhing alien serpent thing - that's ok, sweetie, just let me touch you...&#34; &#34;Say, all those ten-foot-tall humanoids were running away from something that caught them, but we never see anything like that...I'm sure there's nothing to worry about...&#34;  This was to Alien as &#34;2010: The Year We Make Contact&#34; was to &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey.&#34;  Scott always has a couple logical plot holes and inconsistencies in his movies, but this was outrageous; he's gone all Tim Burton, interested in something other than plot and character development.  I can't believe Scott actually stole a major plot element from &#34;Aliens vs. Predators&#34;!  I'm going to try and pretend that this movie never happened, so as not to undermine the original Alien...
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I love this series I cant put it down I am done with the first and half though the second and i can not wait to read the third, I dont see why everyone is bashing this book its awesome~
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is crazy addicting and really fun I love this app my cousin first showed it to me and I loved it
B0086700CM|4.0|A fun but frustrating game.  you need to have good reflexes and lag will kill you.  Its great for something to do while you wait.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Of Monsters and Men have done it again.  With \\"My Head Is An Animal\\", they've put out an incredible album that flows brilliantly from beginning to end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a very good thing I can use at school if I need help<br />;p plus my problems with math this can help me slot.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I am not familiar with games like this and it was little hard to figure out but manageable. Overall, a good game.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|Our family is hooked.  This is a series that Twilight fans will like.  Our whole family can enjoy this together, as it is more family friendly than our other fave, True Blood.
B001QKSWOE|2.0|This is a rather old book from the series and while it was an ok read to pass the time it was definitely not worth the $7 for a kindle edition.  I borrowed my copy from the library back in '09 when it came out.  It's not very long and it does leave you teased without being pleased in the plot development area.  Some humor, though not as much as expected given past book experience.  I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this one, I did and I tried so hard to love it but I just couldn't.  Ms. Evanovich you let me down,  big time.<br />  Amazon, what's up with you? $7 and up for kindle books? Do they contain secret treasure maps? Most of the other books are $2.99 or at most $4.99 and they're great books! Like the Jack Daniels series by Konrath or Andrew Mayhem series by Jeff Strand (all which are excellent reads if you like Evanovich but aren't rich) so what gives? Why are these books so much more? I paid a lot for my Kindle Fire at least cut me a break on the books,  geez. Thanks.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great Book can't wait for the sequel and may I say that even though a few quirks are like 50 Shades of Grey the books are not a like.  here you have to experience protagonists and the female lead is independent, strong and financially secure on her own right which completely change the dynamics.<br /><br />I love the supporting characters and their own second story, I hope we get to see that being resolved as the series go forth. My only warning, if you have issues with child abuse know that this book deals with that topic so do not be surprised.<br /><br />I like this series on it's on merit.  I am looking forward to the next two books.
0783240287|1.0|I am one of the few people, apparently, who disliked this video intensely.  I remember watching a pre-Donny Osmond staging of it at a small college theater and fell in love.  I bought the CD  of the original production by Andrew Lloyd Weber/Time Rice and listened until I had the songs memorized.  Years later, I saw the Donny Osmond version and thought he did a good job of producing it.  His voice was good and so were those of the other performers.  The singers playing Joseph's brothers were the highlight of the experience.  They were brilliant.  However, I was disappointed that they changed the narrator from an alto to a soprano.  I also didn't like some of the constumes, though I was admittedly up in the nosebleed section of his production and couldn't see the detail.  The Elvis Pharoh's number was WAY overdone in the Donny Osmond's stage production.<br /><br />I bought this video tape to support a local theater production and figured that owning a Donny Osmond version would be better than living without one.  I was wrong.  The singers playing the brothers were still brilliant, but that is the only good thing I can say about it.  I did not like the camera work of the movie at all.  I didn't like the opening and closing scenes they added, feeling that it didn't add any production value.  I hated most of the costumes involving Potiphar's wife and the cheerleaders in the \\"Go, Go, Go Joseph\\" song.  The Pharoh's scene was even more hammy than the stage production to the point of being unpalatable and most of the costumes were inappropriate.  It was, quite frankly, a raunchy production and had my kids asking questions that needed to wait until they were older to explain.  Disgusted, I threw my copy out after the first viewing.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Totally, Totally Awesome! I adore everything about this book it brought out so many different emotions. Love Will. Love Lake. Love this Book. One of my favorite books this year. You MUST read it.
0345529057|5.0|Mr. Martin's rich imagination is a treasure. Make sure you have some time on your hands before you start this series because once you enter this world, you're going to want to follow these characters straight through to the end. These books offer so much more than the (fantastic) Game of Thrones series on HBO. Find out about more great books that became great tv series here: [...]
B007SGM084|5.0|What can i say I loved this books.  I guess the whole dysfunctional couple with the added BDSM is just irresistible.  The series are well written the information is pretty accurate.  I am surprised to see this subject has become so open after this books hit the market.<br /><br />I had read a Beautiful Disaster prior to reading 50 Shades and enjoy it very much and I have read Bared to You since ad even though I liked them all 50 Shades is still my fave.  Ladies and Gentlemen make sure you read it as a couple, it more effective that way!
0143121316|5.0|Great comprehensive book on Chinese foreign policy and a valuable insite into the Chinese decision making process.  Great book for the classroom, or for casual reading.  Perfect for anyone interested in China.
B0000CL57F|1.0|We were shipped a different edition then was pictured.<br />We needed it for a class and I had to buy another book because of it.<br />VERY UNHAPPY!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I just got this app less than 5hrs ago and its already super fun! The music is very exciting plus the levels equal challenging. The good part about Angry Birds Seasons is that it gives levels from 2011-2012. Totally worth getting this for FREE!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. I only have 4 boxes but I love this game it is AMAZING!!!!!!!! I would definately recommend this game. Btw the Magic Box is best so far. :))))))
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|This is a decent enough interpretation of a book based on real events. However, I think it is worth mentioning a few things the movie takes liberties with (when compared to the book) since we are talking about real people:<br /><br />There are no indications in the book that Walt McCandless was anywhere as big a jerk as he is portrayed to be in the movie. This is one of the great mysteries of McCandless' disappearance.  He was a well loved and well treated kid from an upper-middle class family that was entirely average in that they, too, had their secrets.  Walt's big secret was that for a bit he was basically living two lives as described in the movie, but he and his wife had long since put that behind them. Other than that, this was a pretty normal family... except for Chris.<br /><br />Chris was not the self-impressed hippie that some of the negative reviewers think he is, and he isn't necessarily portrayed that way in the movie - though Penn's directorial gestures and focus on certain aspects of the story might lead you to think that a little bit. Neither is Chris nearly as naive as some people think. He was highly idealistic, to a fault, and had an over-developed sense of honor and desire for truth and realism.<br /><br />Also, there is no solid indication that Chris ate the wrong plant leading to his death - in fact, Krakauer dismisses this theory and gives a very plausible and logical alternative - an alternative that would be very difficult to portray in the movie. Indications are Chris only suspected he had poisoned himself, and honestly he probably had, just not in the way portrayed in the movie. Certainly if Chris had known how he had poisoned himself, he would have written down what he had done - but he did not.<br /><br />Chris was a unique person, but he was far, far from a hippie. If anything, he was an anarchist with extremely high ideals - so high, they led to his death. I'm not romanticizing what he did. What he did was rash, but he was YOUNG man,just a kid, really - so sure of himself, but still figuring out who he was and trying to reconcile the reality of his life and existence with his own idealized version of the world. There is nothing wrong with that, it's just sad that it cost him his life. What he did to his family was selfish, but look at what he did for everyone else around him - he was also kind, caring, and giving.<br /><br />This is a pretty good movie, but Sean Penn's stamp of liberalism rears its ugly head a few too many times for my tastes and some of the liberties with the story are a little annoying as well, but there are some great performances from Hal Holbrook and the lead actor.  I enjoyed it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this to download on my Kindle Fire! I kept looking for it and it was never available until now....I am soooo happy! This is so addicting once you start playing you will not be able to stop.....lol
B0086700CM|5.0|sometimes I cant pass some accomplishments but it was worth downloading and playing it a bunch of times<br />it is awesome and addicting
B007J4T2G8|5.0|omg, hot hot hot and WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! can't wait for the movie naughty bits and all.Pretty darn good for a first time author.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Once I got a couple of chapters into this book I couldn't put it down!! Definitely better than the first book and I cannot wait until the third comes out!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addictive. I can never be satisfied with any game. but Temple Run is an amazing game. my whole class loves this game and we compare and trade are devices everywhere. I got this game on my opossum and was so eager to get it on my kindlefire. it works great! my whole family enjoys it!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This movie is great. For some reason, I don't recall any advertisements for this movie. If you like star wars, this would be the movie for you. I didn't like the ending though, it felt incomplete.<br /><br />Highly underrated movie, highly recommended
0345803485|4.0|I expected this book to be very well written because of all of the hype behind it. It's not at all. She uses the same words over and over. I'm on book two and I hate the word murmur because it's used on every single page that has speaking. If you're looking for a fun book, this is it. I did enjoy the book for what it is. Go into it light hearted and you'll enjoy it.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|This book is interesting and the sequel is even better (Pandemonium)!!! Definitely purchase, you'll be glad you did. Cannot wait until the last book of the trilogy comes out next year!
0345803485|1.0|After all the hype I had to read this book. What a disappointment! No story line to speak of and the people were boring. Don't waste your time. If you want a good book, try Jackie Collins. At least you can enjoy it.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Like the TV show, flows easily and quickly. An entertaining read with good action and suspense.  Not intense, but engaging. Perfect for passing time in airport, on plane, or on the beach.
1579128955|5.0|It's a great book. It is very detailed and has fantastic pictures. It shows the abbreviations for each element. It also tells about the authors own life.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I think the pictures are nice and is really good puzzles It keeps me busy and nice to add more puzzles for free love it
B0078YWDHO|3.0|I wanted to see this movie about P.R. and knew it was based on a story done some years ago.  At the end, saw it was based on real life events.<br />Interesting, and the acting was ok.<br /><br />Scenery was good.<br /><br />G. Sweitzer
0718157834|5.0|I got the book expecting it to be a light read. Another light romance with a twist. But once I started reading I just couldn't put it down. The story was so real, so moving that I was on pins and needles glued to it till the very last page. Though it's not a happy-ending story it is a heart-warming one.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the best games I know about. Before I got my Kindle Fire, I would take my friend's iPhone and play on hers. This is such a great and addicting game. And it works SO well on my Fire! Love this!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad that they finally brought this game to the Kindle! I love it! It is very addicting!
0345803493|5.0|I love this trilogy.. I own all three and I could not let it down at all.. It I soo good!!!
B001IF277K|5.0|This is an original battery for Sony Ericsson phones. Brought it for my Xperia X10i and I am delighted because it is the exact of the original that came with the phone. No regrets here, happy with the purchase.
B005LAIH3G|2.0|I bought the 3D version of John Carter, knowing that it got fairly bad reviews by movie critics but hoping that it might be good based on the reviews given here.  Alas, I see that the movie critics were right.  The first indication that things were not going well was when John Carter was going to send a telegraph and he said his name was \\"Carter, John Carter\\".  It sounded like a<br />bad version of one of the 007 movies.  When he finally arrives on Mars he's barely able to walk or stand because his \\"weight\\" is so much different than on Earth.  Also because of this, he is able to jump to amazing heights, like hundreds of feet!  Since a 180 lb man will still weight around 68 lbs on Mars, it's a little strange that he can hardly keep himself on the ground.  My son weighs<br />less than 60 lbs and I don't see him jumping hundreds of feet in the air.  There were all sorts of things like this.  I also thought the acting was equally unbelievable.  I'd check it out from your local library instead of buying it.  Save your money.
0345803485|2.0|I didn't dive into this book expecting great literature, thank God.  By about the third chapter I was already sick to death of the oh-my's, eye rolling, lip biting, breath hitching, and variations on the Paris-Hilton-esque \\"That's hot.\\"  Not to mention the subconscious and inner goddess; I'm not sure it's possible to have personified them any more...or any more painfully.  A protagonist who is supposedly a student of literature really should have a broader vocabulary and more descriptive ability.<br /><br />I realize this was written as a money-maker; good job on that point.  With all the dough she rakes in from this series maybe the author will invest in a new thesaurus before attempting another work.  The only thing more torturous than the sex in this book is the writing.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Got the first showing of the movie in 3D  at my local theatre today. It was everything I hoped it would be. The scenery, graphics, props, special effects, story line, all were top notch. The 3D was good too. Not the kind where you have objects flying out at you. It made you feel more like you were in the movie.<br /><br />This movie can stand on it's own for sure but it will make more sense if you've seen the other Alien movies. Some questions are answered and new questions are presented. Nothing against this movie, but don't try to look for a comparison to \\"Aliens\\". To me Aliens is the best action alien sci-fi movie ever. I wish they could put Aliens in 3D on the movie screen.<br /><br />I pre-ordered a Blue-Ray disc so I can add it to my Alien collection and enjoy it whenever the urge strikes. I have probably watched Aliens 25 times.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I love angry birds space but what about updates and danger zone??? when is the kindle fire going to get them??????????????????
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|A delight for an old M/S office user. I only find wireless print functions missing, but I have a utility that works around that, so no real problem... I hope support will be added later. Purchased fonts and paid with PayPal, got no download, left a note to support. We'll see how well they address this minor problem... I like the function of this more than the pre-installed 'stuff' on my Kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|sometimes it stops up on my kindle fire,  but other than that,  best application/ app ever!!!(: highly recomend it! every one should get it. its such a great way to make time go faster. VERY ADDICTIVE!

B004JN1D2I|2.0|This is not a review of the story - it is decidedly brilliant and worth the read. More than enough reviews cover this.<br /><br />Note that I use a Kindle Touch so some of what I refer to may be more limited in scope.<br /><br />I am VERY disappointed in both Amazon and Random House for validating this package for sale when it is in such a poorly thought-out format.<br /><br />First, of all X-Ray is not supported in this edition, although it is supported in the individual books - what gives? It's a great feature which makes paying a premium price for ebooks almost fair. It is an add-on of value.<br /><br />Second, in this edition they have substituted some highly detailed but illegible maps (found, for example, in the standalone version of Book II,) for readable, though less detailed maps, such as can be found in Book I. Is it all that much to ask for detailed and readable?<br /><br />Third, another reviewer mentioned this collection as being more of an \\"anthology\\" than a \\"bundle\\" and that is spot-on. It is one big file which lacks in creating a \\"book at a time\\" experience. It would be less of an issue if my searches had an option to be limited to the book I was reading but I did not note such an option; therefore, when I search I end up getting results from all the books which makes my queries cumbersome and time consuming to sort through.<br /><br />Fourth, there are no page numbers - c'mon, really? I am aware that earlier versions of this set had page numbers which were broken. It would appear that the fix was to remove them entirely. I hope the medical community doesn't adopt this approach.<br /><br />Why do I blame Random House? Their QA is obviously poor, and it seems likely that the profit on this series is such that it doesn't need to be addressed. Original editions were rife with spelling inconsistencies. The individual version of Book II still has useless maps and page numbers which cease working at p. 41, etc.<br /><br />Why do I blame Amazon? This givesthe appearance that Amazon does not advocate for the customer. Don't get me wrong, I love Amazon and have for many years; however, \\"advocating\\" for a customer is a level above being good to a customer, and they've always been good to me. Amazon is a player in the publishing industry. With that comes some responsibility to fight for a superior product, especially for customers who happen to be tied to their own hardware platform.<br /><br />I realize that I may incur the wrath of some, but it would be more than offset if I might help a couple of folks.<br /><br />My personal preference is to get the individual books instead.
B007G5K066|2.0|The pace of this film was glacial:  Two hours of dour expressions, slow pans right-left-in-out, and unintriguing filler scenes like the one with the bee in the car.  This viewer went into blissful slumber several times.  Even M. Night Shyamalan's films are fast-paced by comparison, and they always have a WHOA! ending.  There was an effort to close the flim with a bang, but it came off as a whimper.<br /><br />And the blu-ray quality is not one you would use to demo your new plasma, a purposeful choice by the director no doubt.<br /><br />What a waste of excellent acting talent this file is.
B002N5N5LG|4.0|This is about a group of community college students with different backgrounds who form a Spanish study group together and start to really like one another and become a family in itself. But even with a thematically linked story the real reason for watching this show are the different forms of humor. I actually found the second season funnier but this season was good even if a notch down. Top episodes to me were \\"Physical Education\\", \\"Debate 109\\" and \\"Communication Studies\\".<br /><br />Ken Jeong, who becomes more prominent in the second season, has some good lines but he absolutely steals in the second season. An elderly but still viable Chevy Chase plays the crude humorous senior citizen returning to school. Jack Black makes a special appearance in one episode. Alison Brie, who is the wife of Peter in \\"Mad Men\\", plays Annie, the young idealistic Jewish girl.<br /><br />The show was based on the personal experiences of writer Dan Harmon, who spent a good deal of time putting a cast together that had chemistry. It has won some notable awards including The 36th People's Choice Awards.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; HUMOR: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: January to March 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game....sooo addictive! They need to add more stuff to unlock or achieve. Otherwise it's the best! My seven year old son holds the high score :/ Lol
B0087FMUCQ|3.0|great game.  easy<br />could be better by making it harder at some points.<br />I got the game thinking it would be hard but it was very easy. I was hoping for a good solid game not a game that I finished in less than an hour.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is fun and amusing,and u can't ask anthing more from a game like this. SO GET THIS GAME!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have been very pleased with this app.  It can pin point where I am &amp; give me a localized weather report.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great app for my kids to play they love the characters and the way they have to take care of all thier favorites
B00845PRDS|5.0|First off let me say I have seen \\"worse\\" acting from Stallone, Arnold, Seagal and the like.  So for an action flick acting is never a criteria is it?<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie immensely.  Best action flick I have ever seen even better then my old fav Braveheart.  The best part about this movie for me was the fact that it had zero Hollywood \\"blockbuster\\" feel.  It just was a great movie and I loved the camera work especially at the end.  The only time the movie \\"went hollywood\\" was for part of the ending, if you've seen it I bet you know which part I mean.  I did enjoy the ending though.
0312641893|5.0|Loved, loved, loved Cinder !

Cinder is adopted, an adopted cyborg with no memory of her past before a terrible accident that left her- a cyborg. Cyborgs are treated as slaves, to be bought and sold at will. Which her widowed step mother reminds her of often. Cinder is a mechanic and can fix her self an about anything else electronic in the Kingdom. This is how she meets the prince. He brings her his trusted bot to be fixed. Things whirl into action as political dramas, possible wars and an outbreak of the plague terrorizes the planet.

B004UID2LC|4.0|I like the app very much. I would have given it a five star rating, but the app forces close a lot. Sometimes when I download a song or a video, it doesn't show up and I have to downloaded again, then it works. Otherwise good app.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I just finished the audiobook, brilliantly performed by Ann Marie Lee. The last third of the book I found most unsettling. I could see the unraveling of Camile's life and I was sure there would be no happy ending for her. She was so self destructive, and her choices were so bad that I wanted to shake her. The bit at the end with the dollhouse had me gasping and horrified. I wont soon forget this book, and I will absolutely find her other novels. This was really well done.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is a replacement for my original Kindle 2 charging cable.  The MicroUSB cable charges my smartphones, Kindle2, and Kindle Fire.  My favorite aspect - that the cable is longer than any of the factory cables which came with my other devices (including the Kindle Fire).  Works well when I run it behind my desk.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use and quick to put a lesson plan together.<br />overall very helpful and useful. I can recomand for someone who is new at Sunday school leading.

145210655X|4.0|I bought this for my son, Luke and he had a ball reading it over and over. But the really surprising thing about it is its sensitive portrayal of a parent's needs and anxieties of raising a son. Many of the illustrations are beautifully realised and as well as being funny capture the parental bonding with their child. The attention to detail is phenomenal and will appease the Star Wars fan. It has many scenes reimagined from the Star Wars saga that are instantly recognizable such as Cantina scene, Death Star and growing up in Tatooine. Luke is always cute and Vader looms large and menacing but is never cruel to his son, rather is caring and tries his best to please his very demanding son. It is easy to thumb through and the quality is excellent. I only wished it had more pages as it's so engaging.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I have to say, this game could be a good game, if EVERYTHING wasn't so expensive. You get very little money and it buys so little. I kept trying, but no longer. It takes waaaay to long.
B0086700CM|3.0|great game, very addictive and fun, but it tends to get laggy the longer you play. running on the kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are quite fun and a little challenging. Everyone in the whole wideworld should have 101-in-1 games great great great great great great game
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|I absolutly love this movie.  Something about watching these kids trying to kill each other off was extemely awesome.  I must say I was a bit dissapointed with the ending but heck, it sure was a ride getting there.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|It's a great product.  So many other baby monitors are just really crappy quality and terrible features for crazy prices.  It's like the wedding effect on venues; as soon as you say \\"baby\\" webcam prices go through the roof.  Basically, if Apple were to make a baby monitor, this would be it.  From the awesome stylish packaging, to the great user interface and features, superb quality, and convenience all in 1 cute box.  It's perfect for what we need, especially being able to check the monitor from work on my iphone.  It's like I'm working from home and can run up to check on her whenever I want.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great story, less than great writing. Loved it though. It was a bit long-winded, but it's definitely worth reading. This series isn't just about the sex, but unfortunately that's what it's being recognized for.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Everything I wanted to know about this book was answered in the reviews.  While reading the description of the book and learning that it was a romance, I was thinking that it would be interesting to see how a man would handle a romance novel that was written as a romance novel and not another genre with romance as a secondary plot.  The reviews all answered that question quite quickly.<br /><br />It has been my experience that women usually handle the romance, and exotica much better then men, especially when these are the main themes., and it seems my first suspision was correct.  Although I have read a few novels by men authors who could handle romance with skill as long as it is secondary or fleeting, for the most part,  when it comes to these subjects it is handled much more skillfully by women when written as the main theme.<br /><br />oh dear.  It may sound a bit sexist, what I have said, and is not meant to be.  That has just been my experience, and the reviews on this book still keeps me believing that.
B001BPJJ82|4.0|I have wanted to see this movie for years... and very glad I finally had an opportunity to do so.  It did not disappoint, very well produced.  The colors were extremely vibrant and the picture was crystal clear.
B004UHSB5A|4.0|This is a cool game to keep you occupied if you're waiting at the doctor's office. I liked it; it is better than other Dominoes games out there. Plus, it was free. What more could you ask for?
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|the only draw back is that it doesn't read arabic, the words are scattered all over the screen and letters are disconnected.
0553386794|5.0|This is what i call a good reading and so as the Series itself,.<br />But i was a little disappointed when they killed off one of my Favorite<br />Characters,(drogo) at the beginning.<br />So as i know, how the series will END...
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Classic films such as Ben Hur and Cleopatra are great Hollywood masterpieces that had grandeur sets filled with countless extras, which today are too impractical and expensive to recreate.  This movie brings some of that magic back using modern digital techniques and with a sci-fi spin.<br /><br />This is an epic film in the literal sense... (not as in oh dude, that was so epic!, but more as in Homer's The Odyssey).  It is very classic Hollywood stuff, and very entertaining.  I enjoyed watching it in the movie theater.<br /><br />I was surprised it did not do so well.  Perhaps it just didn't fit in with all the other films that came out around that time, which is just as well, because it has a timeless quality.  Perhaps in another 10 years it will become a Hollywood classic.  It happens to some films that are viewed myopically, such as The Shining, where the true value of the film is not understood until 10 or 20 years later.
B005IZLPME|5.0|It is an excellent 3-D DVD and I enjoyed watching it on my Samsung 3-D TV and using<br />3-D Vizio Blue Ray player connected by using a 3-D HDMI cable.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Ridley Scott wanted to make a film that asked big questions but, at the same time, could be tied into the same universe he pioneered for the \\"Alien\\" franchise. Although flawed \\"Prometheus\\" does have merit. You can read all the pro (5 star) and con (1 star)reviews to determine the brilliance or stupidity of this film.<br /><br />I'd argue that eventually \\"Prometheus\\" may, like \\"Blade Runner\\", see its reptutation rise with time. Either way, \\"Prometheus\\" is an often stunning looking film from Scott and, in spite of its narrative flaws (the script does have issues), the larger-than-life production values certainly make the film appear impressive looking.<br /><br />You're mileage may vary but try and ignore the hype associated with the film and put your expectations aside. If you ignore both you may find the film enjoyable.<br /><br />The 3D Blu-ray disc looks positively stunning--Scott shows an instinctive feel for 3D--the director uses the process to impress with the gradeur of the film and not as a gimmick. The transfer looks brilliant with deep, inky blacks and an amazing amount of detail evident. During the starmap sequence in particular the 3D effect is positively stunning. Depth is remarkably strong throuhgout the presentation.<br /><br />The regular Blu-ray also looks stunning BUT some players are having some issues (Sony players for example even with the latest upgrade for firmware)with pixelation and cubing where the image breaks up. Usually this is an issue with the disc itself and I'm going to assume that it is in this case although it would be wise to make sure your firmware is up-to-date.<br /><br />The 3D four disc edition comes with a DVD of the film in addition to the 3D and 2D Blu presentation. All three discs have the commentary track and there are deleted/alternate scenes (some of which should have been kept in the film despite pacing issues as they explained the behavior of some characters and gave others additional depth).<br /><br />The fourth disc features a terrific, in depth documentary on the making of the film directed by Charles de Lauzirika. \\"Furious Gods\\" covers everything from the conception of the film (it began as an \\"Alien\\" prequel/reboot), changes to the script over time, production designs and changes to the look of the film as pre-production progressed to production. We get plenty of behind-the-scenes footage. At three hours it's a massive documentary that is equally as impressive as the film looks.<br /><br />We also get the \\"viral\\" videos made of a younger Weyland, information on the production of \\"David\\" the android and other bits and pieces (including a bit of text that \\"suggests\\" a link between \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Prometheus\\" --something that Damon Lindelof had in mind while writing the script but never made explicit).<br /><br />Although flawed with dumb behavior by characters, plot holes that, in this version, you could fly a spaceship through \\"Prometheus\\" still manages to be entertaining particularly if you set aside the expectations created by the hype associated with the film.c features a terrific, in depth documentary on the making of the film directed by Charles de Lauzirika. \\"Furious Gods\\" covers everything from the conception of the film (it began as an \\"Alien\\" prequel/reboot), changes to the script over time, production designs and changes to the look of the film as pre-production progressed to production.

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This is a very strong album by Shinedown. While not as hard as previous, still pretty good. One of the best bands in business.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Saw the movie again, the Zionist overtones made me see it again to re-access my view of the film since the last scene left me with a bad taste, \\"this is Elizabeth Shaw signing off in the year of OUR LORD\\" blah blah whatever. After watching it again, references to the holocaust, focussing on her christian faith over and over, demanding her crucifix back etc. I now hate the movie completely as a British Zionist propaganda film. There is no room for Zionism in any science fiction film for me. I have lost almost all respect for Ridley Scott, the film Alien and Prometheus shamelessly rip-off Planet of the Vampires, but pollute a simple science fiction film with pathetic Zionist overtones, and in light of the wars in the middle east this type of holy crusade indoctrination is completely objectionable to me. If Scott had simple left off with a benign neutral statement of the folly of using weapons of mass destruction and them coming back to haunt and destroy their very creators, I'd have thought it a great theme, BUT Scott CHOSE to make the Shaw character blatantly take the stance of a blindly devote christian holy warrior marching off into the unknown, \\"in the year of OUR LORD 2098\\" or whatever. Huge mistake, and ruined a fine science fiction movie completely. I cannot separate the blatant Zionism from the material as a whole... since Britain is the home of the Zionists and give power to Israel etc.
1933865407|5.0|Oh boy, is this book a beauty (or beauties). This book is supremely impressive in design, overall presentation, production and everything else that makes it a joy to behold. It is large and printed on high quality paper. The art reproductions are flawless, whether they are in black and white or color. Bruce Tim is a living legend of the world of comics and this book is proof of his versatility as he tackles the good girl art field in flying colors. I loved this book so much that I was lucky enough to acquire a signed limited edition through my local comic shop. It is a rare occasion that I double dip for a book, but this work I found merited owning two editions. This book is a must have for your graphic art library. Cheers
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Let It Be was a good album in my opinion despite the slamming it has received. The White Album is probably my favorite, with 20+ A songs on it. Abbey Road was a masterpiece and is probably my second favorite. Sgt Peppers is great and reportedly \\"broke Brian Wilson's heart\\". I am writing this review for one reason. Ringo Starr was the master. Listen to A Day In The Life. That is just mastery. Sure he is no Carter Beauford, but he did the job. Laid out the steady beat for the songs to breathe. As opposed to trying to trying to steal the show.
0316056863|5.0|I'm not even half way through this book and I decided I have to stop to take the time to write a quick review...<br /><br />This is quite possibly the funniest story I've ever read - I've never laughed out loud so many times during one book (several of those times meaning I was laughing to the point of crying - particularly the bit about the haircut and the picture that follows.)<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of Tina Fey should give this book a read. Its so easy to follow and she keeps things interesting the whole time. Its hard to put down.
B000002P2V|3.0|I've had the vinyl version of this album for many years. I always loved the album with plenty of un-hailed gems that haven't been fully appreciated over the years.<br /><br />When this re-issued version came out naturally I had to have it.<br /><br />I'm not totally against remixing an album as long as the original elements are still there and it adds to the sound.<br /><br />Generally the remixes of the who catalogue have been good but not this time.<br /><br />What a disappointment. Apart from the extra tracks which are a welcome bonus, the remixing is a total hatchet job. There are different arrangements with bits missing (music must change guitar solo). It just doesn't sound the same. I actually don't think it even needed a re-mix. The original has always sounded fine to me.<br /><br />So, I got on to Amazon Canada and was able to pick up a brand new copy of the original mix which is the one that I play most.
0785153322|5.0|Firstly, this set is gargantuan, heavy and beautiful.  The Hulk would get a hernia lifting it. Seriously though,for what you get with this set it is a bargain. I think one or two of these books are already out of print and go for big bucks on the collectors market. Here you get one big beautiful slipcase for all four books, and take my word for it, it looks cool as heck on a book shelf. Each book is a real work of art in their own right and the art of the films within each book is truly beautiful to behold. Well worth the investment. Cheers
B0061S073A|4.0|love everything about it -just wish I could pick my own background.I bought it after my granddaughter downloaded $10 of stuff that I had to turn around and remove and NOT get my money back for.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First off, Hugh Howey is an incredibly writer. The world he creates in Wool is extraordinary, deep, and full of surprises. As you progress through the story, you find that the characters are little chess pieces in a game that is bigger than you could ever imagine. I would highly recommend this to everyone, it covers a load of genres from sci-fi to horror to thriller to romance to mystery. I think that sci-fi fans will find it easier to jump into the Wool universe than non-sci-fi fans, but the story isn't outlandish enough to drive away normal fiction readers.<br /><br />Seriously, read this.
0385344228|3.0|Different pace than my usual slow heavy reads.  I liked the fast pace and unexpected events that occurred.  Much smarter and well written than the other mass mystery books out there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun to play when you are bored and have nothing to do I like it very much
0345803485|1.0|I'm not sure I have any authority to write a review, as I got bored and skipped ahead to even get through the first chapter. So, just a brief comment, the reviewer who wondered if a teenager wrote this is spot on. No matter how hyped in the media, no matter how supposedly erotic, I can't summon the interest to read on. The writing style is on a par with a \\"true romance\\" magazine story in the 50's.
B0050KEVO6|3.0|This game will first seem way to easy, but after the first 20 or so elements, you will have to get very creative. Alchemy is good for discovering how some elements are actually made and makes you really think about what to combine. It even gets pretty addicting after you get in the mind of it.

0316098515|4.0|Undoubtedly a masterpiece from one of the most creative upcoming chefs today. Daniel has perfectly captured the opportunities offered by America and New York in particular and will go a long way - possibly down the route of a little more simplicity which usually goes along with a little maturity. Now that he has shown the world the extreme sophistication he has achieved, the time will no doubt come to focus a little more on the simplicity of the raw product vs. the fireworks of appearance.
0345803485|1.0|This book was not one of the better books I have read.  I felt like I was reading Twilight all over again.  Only the writing seemed like that of a teenager.  And a young teen at that.  There were too many repeats or over usage of phrases such as \\"he/she murmured\\" and \\"he whispered.\\"  Don't get me started on that lip biting thing that Ana kept doing.  That was Bella from the Twilight movies.<br /><br />What I find most disturbing is this book condoned abuse.  Okay if your thing is BDSM that is fine but consenting to abuse with a contract?  Grey was abusive he wasn't just into weird kinky fetishes.  He was a stalker.  He was a control freak.  He was into rape.  He didn't want her to see her friends.  All the things that we tell women to run from.<br /><br />It was like a seeing the aftermath of a car accident.  I just couldn't pull my eyes away even though I wanted to.  I had to see how bad this really got.<br /><br />I think maybe an editor should have done a bit more editing on this before it was published.  I almost want to read the next 2 books just to see if they are as bad.<br /><br />Excuse me but I must go cleanse my mind with some Stephen King or Anne Rice.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness is the first book in the All Souls Trilogy. I would have to say that is a paranormal romance (PNR) for the sophisticate due to the fact that it is not your typical PNR novel. I want to first point out that Ms. Harkness is a history professor at the University of Southern California and a wine connoisseur. She writes a great wine blog, Good Wine Under $20. All while reading this book; I craved some serious wine and wanted to know more about the history of alchemy. I can't imagine the research it took to write this amazing novel.<br /><br />Ms. Harkness created a wonderful character in Diana Bishop. She is a witch in deep denial. Diana has incredible innate magical power. However, in her mind, everything has a scientific and historical context. Magic really has no room in her life. She is intelligent, strong and independent. Then her life is turned upside down when in the Oxford Bodleian Library she calls up an enchanted alchemical manuscript, Ashmole 782. She feels it's magic but doesn't understand it. She sends it back to the stacks of the library. By opening the ancient manuscript, she has pulled all kinds of supernatural creatures to her. Quickly, she is surrounded by witches, daemons, and vampires. They all want the manuscript which could hold secrets to their existence. One vampire in particular has been looking for Ashmole 782 for centuries. Matthew Clairmont is a 1500-year-old vampire who has obsessed about the origin of his species. He would do just about anything to get ahold of that manuscript. He is secretive, controlling and powerful and he would change Diana's life forever.<br /><br />I love all the scientific, historical and alchemical references in the book. It's the reason I call it a PNR for the sophisticate. Ms. Harkness's description of all the alchemical illustrations is so vivid. To me, each image just jumps off the page. Just like her illustration descriptions, her use of wine in the story also enhances the imagery of the book. I love the aroma and the taste of each wine and I want to savor each drop. Her depiction of each wine really helps in describing each character, especially Matthew. I can see him savoring each sip of a deep, rich red wine. Each character has their own particular drink that they prefer and which fits each personality. Matthew loves wine. Diana drinks herbal tea. Aunt Sarah loves her whiskey as does Marcus. It really, for me, paints a wonderful personality for each character.<br /><br />As I focus on the academic references and wine, at the heart of this book is a forbidden romance. I really enjoyed the portrayal of Diana and Matthew's relationship. She is a witch who feels quickly while Matthew is a vampire who takes his time (he has all the time in the world). Furthermore, vampires and witches have hated each other for ages. They are not supposed to love each other. But they do and it works. You feel their passion, doubts and conflicts. You want a happily ever after, but will it happen for Diana and Matthew? Time will tell! Literally!!<br /><br />Like any good book in a trilogy, it ended with one heck of a cliff hanger. I absolutely can't wait for the next book, Shadow of Night. Its release date is July 10, 2012. I will buy it the minute it comes out.the imagery of the book.

0375714839|5.0|The first part of the book is Marjane's account of her childhood, the changes happening around her, the motivation of the Iranian revolution. It was an amazing read of the story of a child seeing tyranny, revolution, war, and religious fundamentalism. For anyone wanting to give living room pronouncements of what we should do about Iran the least they can do is read this book.<br /><br />The rest of the bookwas good but not as great as the first part. A part of it was annoying teenage angst. But it did make you think about identity issues, and finding a place in a restricted society. Decent read but kind of a let-down after the riveting beginning of the book.<br /><br />The movie [[ASIN:B000YAA68W Persepolis]] is excellently executed. I would recommend watching it too after you've read the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great way to past time. User friendly and great graphics.  lot of ads but using back button makes it disappear quickly.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|I love the Derek Trucks Band!  Be aware, though.  Don't purchase this CD to hear DTB; there are only about 3 tracks where you will have that enjoyment.  While Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks Band are both great performers, I had expected this compilation CD to be a more even balance between them.  This CD should be titled \\"Tedeschi Performs, with visiting guest, Derek Trucks Band.\\"  My personal disappointment almost gave it 3-stars, because there are many blues singers better than Tedeschi.  But I gave it 4-stars, because there aren't many blues bands as awesome as the Derek Trucks Band, and they deserve the credit.  The arrangements and performances ARE really good - you just don't get a satisfying Derek Trucks Band fix.
0345803485|5.0|The story of Christian Grey had me involved from the very beginning.  I could not put this book down, and I even took it with me when my mom had surgery.  This is a story that not only is enjoyable for a wife, but her husband will also reap the rewards.

An impeccable record and listen to it next to the mythical Barry Gibb is very emotional. Wonderful musical arrangements. Highlighting the issues 'Guilty' and 'Woman in Love'...classics!!<br />An unforgettable cd.

0345803493|1.0|I only gave this series one star since I had to in order to submit this review.  I have no idea what the hype with these books is all about.  The scenes are very steamy, but there are so many that after a while I was yawning...really.  The writing was horrible.  The characters were so WHINY, and the story line leaves much to be desired.  I believe the author is from England, but her characters are American.  I think maybe I would like it better if maybe they were from England, living in America.  I had a really hard time with the dialogue because a lot of the things the characters said were probably terms common to England and not the United States.  If you're looking for a good trashy novel, this isn't it.  It doesn't even rate that high.

B007ZJDGXC|4.0|It's an OK movie, not the best ever, also not bad, is worth the 2 hours and the rental price. It has some good action scenes. I was hesitant on how many stars, 3-4 is where I think this belongs, at the end I decided on 4 stars, maybe because I think Denzel is a superb actor and is always good to see a great actor.

0345803485|1.0|I sooo wish I had read these reviews before I got sucked into the unwarranted hype surrounding this dumb book. 514 pages & all I can say is DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF!! Where do I start 1st it's not an erotic novel it's the internal (never-ending mind you) clamoring of whiny child experiencing her first cute boy. 2nd it's annoyingly repetitive in too many ways to explain. 3rd unless you are a novice or prude (which you're fully allowed to be) the \\"sex\\" will bore you to tears it's soooo mild I can't even deem it erotic ...all & all I was fully annoyed @ page 176 & should have stopped but I hoped it would turn & it never did. Needless to say I will be gifting it to a coworker who is a genuine novice, it's proper audience.
B00715RI16|3.0|1 was most definitely my favorite in the series -- 2 explains some stuff that was missed in one allowing it to further explain the storyline.  3 ... well... 3 explains 1 detail delivers 1 or 2 moments where it will scare the crap out of you, but honestly doesnt deliver anywhere near what 1 did or the filler information 2 did...

B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very fun game it is good exercise for the fingers<br />everybody in my family has this app<br />so download when you get a chance<br />you will love it
B0086700CM|5.0|This game rocks I had it on my Iphone but the screen was to small but on my kindle firebl this is amazing so yes buy this get u will get addicted very easily
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very addicting. scrat is fun to catch. would like to earn acorns because buying them is senseless and a waste of money.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This series is amazing with all the twist that happens in it. You can't even figure out Bella till the ending:0. And they let a demon help them Dean who would have thunken? ;). These series always have a twisted story about a little bedtime story we've heard of which is amazing. They've made me think that true producers actually live out there finally! And the chemistry they have for each other as brothers is unchany ^^. Wish I had some cool brothers like you around;). Especially to kick the monsters out from under my bed xD
0307454541|1.0|I found this book to be very SLOW for at least the first half. So much detail about money market etc...it started to pick up at a little past the half way point. I am not sure if something got lost in translation, but I did not find this book worth the effort.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is fun if you enjoy puzzles. It is slow moving and you can repeat levels as often as you want. I enjoy this game when I have time to waste. I usually play a couple of levels and then I am ready to turn the game off. This game could be considered boring, which is another reason I only play a couple of levels before I turn the game off. This game is a good puzzle game though.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was surprised how I got drawn onto this whole series of books. Don't read this unless you read 1 & 2.<br />I recommend the whole series. Tough to put down once I started.
B005LAIH3G|3.0|In general, Amazon reviews have always been right on for me, And after seeing all the Furor over the movie and how cheap it is to pick up the DVD I almost reached in and snagged one,,,Glad I didnt,  I read the John Carter book series back in high school and rememberd alittle of the story line Characters mostly, It does have good CGI but I saw better in StarWars epic battle scenes, Guess I just didnt get into it, My reccomendation is you go to Amazon Instant Video and watch it first $3.99( Like I did) Then you also might not feel a need to watch it again
0312370849|5.0|I really liked this book. I could not put it down. I read it with my book club and we all felt the same way.
1400032717|5.0|This is a wonderful story & impressively written from the view-point of a youngster with autism. It's a fairly quick read which is good because it can become frustrating reading a book written in this style. Still, you will enjoy it immensely.
0439023521|5.0|I had to read this to find out what all the buzz was about. Not my typical read, but I couldn't put it down!<br />Whatever you think you know about this book, you may be as surprised as I was when you actually read it.<br />I hear everyone talk about the violence and honestly that is like a side dish to the main course. I read all three book and loved them!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I was skeptical when choosing this book, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. It moves along quite well while one continues to figure out who did it and why. The added interaction of the reporter and police officer give it a good diversion from the norm, as it weaves its way through the mystery.The description of the people and places gives the reader a good visual as they follow along in solving the mystery. If you're looking for a new mystery author, this one provides a good read.
B0088WFZQG|4.0|I was hesitant to rent this one.  I didn't go to see it in the movie theater due to the advertising -- it seemed a little gimmicky to create a movie with 'real navy seals'.  When those types of gimmicks are used, the movie is usually bad.  As it turns out, the movie was quite entertaining and definitely worth renting.<br /><br />I've had a lifelong interest in the military and special ops, in particular.  I served as an infantry soldier during peace time (between the two Iraq wars) and have read a countless number of real life accounts of SEALs, Delta, Green Berets, Rangers, etc.  I don't generally like movies that are overly rah-rah patriotic and unrealistic (i.e. the good guys never die and manage to kill hundreds of bad guys) -- they just make me feel uncomfortable, like I'm watching propaganda.  I did NOT get that feeling with this movie.  While it is made completely from a pro-US perspective, the movie moves fast and doesn't dwell on politics or attempt to convert you to a specific way of thinking.  It's  unrealistic in parts but it doesn't go so far overboard where you feel like your intelligence has been insulted -- as long as you are comfortable with the concept that special operators are constantly practicing their trade and are always working on new and better ways of doing things, therefore, they are really good at what they do.<br /><br />I was also concerned about the acting.  When a movie doesn't use professional actors, the lines are delivered poorly and the conversations appear contrived.  While non of the actors in this movie are going to win Hollywood awards for their performance, the movie didn't require professional actors.  It really relies on the action sequences, which are constant.  The dialogue is just there for some basic support and understanding.  The funny thing is, these men were able to deliver the 'military' conversations much more realistically than any actor could.  It was obvious that the master chief delivered a few of his lines many times in the past.  90% of the movie is mission related conversations and action.  Thus, the remaining 10% which focused on personal stories or interactions, was unimportant to my enjoyment of the movie.  To be fair, that 10% wasn't good -- there was an attempt to add to the storyline with the personal stories of a couple of the operators and it just didn't come off well.  I would have preferred that they simply referenced some of the items and didn't attempt to 'enhance' or 'personalize' the movie with that portion of the story.  I get the message but sometimes you can deliver a stronger message with less detail.  Attempting to portray a personal story without a professional actor would be like sending Robert Deniro into downtown Fallujah to shoot bad guys -- not gonna' work.<br /><br />Bottom line.  I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed watching this one.  It's definitely worth a few bucks and a couple hours of your time.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|wow what a fun game. game play is easy. graphics are great and best of all its free. very addictive play at your own risk and enjoy.

B007N85ZXY|3.0|Some of these reviews are really taking ole Neil to task here for no reason.  It's pretty much what you *should* expect from Neil and Crazy Horse doing a bunch of their favorite tunes from the past.  There is not a specific focus on a time period here (ala Ry Cooder).  They're just kind of burning through songs they love that have a kinda-sorta theme, which was kind of the point of this release, IMO.  This is Crazy Horse, folks, they've been putting out this exact same kind of stuff for decades.<br /><br />They are not a technically accomplished band (as a unit), and if you like Crazy Horse, you [again] should probably know this.  It's just a bunch of old rockers getting together in Neil's barn to have a good time and record some rock tracks.<br /><br />As stated in some of the 1-star reviews, this album doesn't break new ground, doesn't provide any other-worldly experiences, etc.  It's a standard NY&CH album.  For me, it fits right in with anything they've knocked out since the REAL good stuff of old.  In other words, it ain't Rust Never Sleeps and it ain't Live Rust. What it IS is loud, nasty, gritty, heartfelt, and quickly and passionately played and recorded ... basically what you expect from Neil when he's in the mood to rock (ie rather than reflect acoustically).<br /><br />I think some of these negative reviews may be coming from kids who are building their personal music experience and trying to compare this album to something like Harvest or whatever.  Kids, musicians like Neil get tired of trying to change the world sometimes, and a man of Neil's stature and history, who has lived 67 years, lived through multiple wars that he personally busted his butt to sing about and campaign against, with a story that would top the average joe's, a disabled son, a [fairly] recent aneurysm.... well, let's just say, he's earned the right to put out a pretty kicking album of standards.  If you truly have been listening to every NY album for the last forever, I'm surprised that you feel any 'betrayal' or anything with this one.  It's right down Neil's alley.<br /><br />If you are a musician, you'd do well to listen to these 'amateurish' tracks and learn a thing or two about the power of raw rock music.  Most of what I like about the atmosphere of Tonight's the Night is alive and well in this album.  Try it again.<br /><br />This is a typical Neil Young album.  Learn what the rating system is supposed to mean.  5 stars means it is among the best an artist has ever done.  3 means typical.  1 means unlistenable on any level for anybody, fan or otherwise.<br /><br />In my book, this album gets 3 stars (I'd give it 3.5 if I could) - not bad at all, some great moments, some not-as-great, but not really essential moments.<br /><br />So... give it a chance.  It's a good Neil Young album... beat's the eff out of a lot of his 80's output.  And kids, come back in 10 years and let us know what you think.that you feel any 'betrayal' or anything with this one.

0307730697|5.0|Fearless is a full-throttle, no holding back, breakneck-paced true story of Navy SEAL Adam Brown.  Ever since his childhood, Adam Brown was a risk taker who loved pushing the limits.  This engaging account of his life is nothing short of breathtaking, earth-changing, and absolutely miraculous.<br /><br />Eric Blehm, New York Times Best-selling Author of [[ASIN:0061661236 The Only Thing Worth Dying For: How Eleven Green Berets Fought for a New Afghanistan (P.S.)]], has masterfully illustrated and expressed the fascinating trials, triumphs, tribulations, and turmoil that defined a man hardwired with a mission to give everything he had and was in mind, body, and spirit in service to his country, his family, and his comrades.<br /><br />  One of the most remarkable aspects of Fearless, besides the literary prowess and the novel-like intrigue with which it's written, is that Adam Brown encouraged others to share his entire story, in the event of his death.  He was selfless, courageous, brave, and faith-filled enough that he didn't want any part of his life hidden, no matter how dark that time had been, because he knew that others would find hope and encouragement knowing what he'd gone through.  That has indeed been the case.<br /><br />  Fearless is a portrait of a real American hero with some dark times in his past who, with the assurance of faith in the Lord, the love of family, and close friends, proves that \\"all things are possible for those who love God, who are called according to His purpose.\\" Romans 8:28<br /><br />  Adam Brown took the same approach to pretty much everything he did in life.  His philosophy for everything was: \\"Go hard or go home!\\"  And that's precisely what he did.  He would give whatever or whoever was in front of him his all, and if that wasn't sufficient he would push himself even harder until he reached (and usually far surpassed) his goal.  This approach to his life, military training, and faith earned him the respect of some of the most elite warriors in the U.S. Navy SEALS as well as those around him in the air, on land, in the water, in the barracks, overseas, across enemy lines as well as at home with his wife and children, and the family and friends he held dear back in his hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas.<br /><br />  Only God Himself could have come up with such a plan for one man's life.  What a remarkable example of what we can do with God, for whom nothing is impossible.  Adam Brown experienced many instances of being incredibly broken in mind, body, and spirit, yet he grabbed onto his faith and used his gift of fearlessness to persevere.  When others did throw in the towel and accepted defeat, this man pushed forward relentlessly.  He was seemingly immune to pain, to giving up, to defeat...He gave everything he had and everything he was until he took his very last breath.  If that's not the definition of a true hero, then I don't know what is.<br />[[ASIN:0307730697 Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown]]lite warriors in the U.S. Navy SEALS as well as those around him in the air, on land, in the water, in the barracks, overseas, across enemy lines as well as at home with his wife and children, and the family and friends he held dear back in his hometown of Hot Springs, Arkansas.<br /><br />  Only God Himself could have come up with such a plan for one man's life.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I like to play this game when I'm watching a series show (not usually with a movie though).  I do play it alone without watching something on DVD or on my computer.  It's challenging and fun, if not somewhat frustrating at times...but then, that's the challenge!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun to play and to pass the time away and its also free. makes the hours go by real fast.
B00479SVBU|5.0|When looking for a transmitter for my MP3 player, I read review after review, and all of them said the same thing:  The Soundfly was the BEST.  I had purchased others, and no matter what I paid for them, was sadly disappointed.  Bad reception, didn't hold the channels, less than stellar output.  So, I was a bit skeptical...but I ordered anyway.  Other reviews are spot on!  The Soundfly has the best reception I have ever encountered; it holds the programmed channel without losing reception or wavering in and out; and the output is as clear as the MP3 file allows (quality of the file dictates quality of output).  I am thrilled, and will purchase another for my husband's car.  Trust this one...it is worth the money.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|really liked the movie , shows that Robert Pattionson can do so much more than potraying a vampire.  Can't wait to see what other projects he comes out with after the twilight movies are done.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|I was very impressed with the  amount of extras on the blu-ray. For Grease lovers this is a must have. My teenage cousins get a kick out of the karaoke function on all the songs. It was a hit at their recent sleepover.
0385344228|5.0|Attention - REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS<br /><br />William Landay is the master of his craft. His prose is pitch perfect, writing so flawless that it is pure pleasure to glide along his sentences. Besides an occasional passage or description so striking it calls for re-reading just to savour his talent, the faultless narrative does not detract from the urgent, chilling and fascinating story.<br />Many reviews said one needs to be a parent to fully comprehend the awful dilemma faced by Andy and Laurie, parents of Jacob. This is true; I was heartbroken many times over, as the growing weight of evidence against Jacob is intercepted by Andy's memories of his son as a defenceless, beautiful baby boy in his arms. What would you do? How far would go to spare your child the consequences for what he did or didn't do?<br /><br />Nothing is certain in this thrilling psychological drama. Jacob is as likely to be guilty as he is innocent; the evidence is weak as it is compelling; is he a psychopath or just a typical narcissistic teenager, only perhaps slightly more so, but likely to outgrow it nonetheless? Psychiatrists also make mistakes. The lack of absolute certainty about anything makes Andy's denial only more convincing.<br /><br />Those who are familiar with Dostoevkiy's Crime and Punishment, will recognise the terrible sense of foreboding, the heaviness hovering over the family, the conviction that it is impossible for the perpetrator to escape unscathed. The parents take on a role of Jacob's conscience, they suffer the guilt and ultimately, they dispense and endure the punishment.
B002NANLCE|3.0|Like others have said this is very different from the t.v. series.This has a lot more science in it. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I tried the sample first and it seemed pretty good. In the end too little plot and character development and too much science.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Very boring.  No intellect required.  Very slow.  And for the life of me, couldn't figure out how to exit out of it after starting.  Such a drag.  Not up my alley.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think its cool because it does not need wi-fi and after a while when you build a lot you get a lot of credats I have over 1,000,000! its really fun and suports facebook (you do not need facebook)
B003ASLJS6|5.0|Great in every sense of the word.  Great acting, great action, great story and a wonderful experience from beginning to end.  Great dvd quality as well worth every cent.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting book. It just keeps you reading and reading. You just don't want to put it down. You are always wanting to read on. I would recommend it to anyone that likes to read. Except young ones. You will have to read all 3 of them. When it ended I wanted more. But all good books come to an end.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|Okay, so I see a lot of other Mastodon fans crying that they've sold out or some crap like that. Every time a band decides to change things up, they're labeled sell-outs. Well, I'm here to prove those accusations wrong. I listen to The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Deftones, Melvins, Black Sabbath, Meshuggah, Death, Slayer, Helmet, Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Machine Head, Tool, Rush etc. Can you see where I'm going with this? Each one of these bands have experimented and its opened my eyes up a lot. Music gets stale if it's the same style on every album, experimentation is key. I'm just getting into Mastodon and I've actually listened to some stuff from [[ASIN:B0000DDAU9 Remission]] and [[ASIN:B0002N66FS Leviathan]]. Remission was actually the other Mastodon album I ordered (the deluxe version) but it hasn't gotten here, yet but I love the songs on that album, too. That one and The Hunter are my first Mastodon albums. Anyways, honestly, I liked the material from those albums and The Hunter. I fell in love with each one of these tracks on the first way through, although 3 of the songs I had heard prior.<br /><br />The point? You have to be open-minded to growth and experimentation to like this album. Sorry, but being a metalhead elitist will get you no where with this record. Be open to all forms of metal and rock. The sludgy riffs are still here but they're a bit more clean, I should say. Some guy on youtube described the riffs as \\"Crunch, sludgy, melted-candy-bar-in-the-sun guitar riffs.\\" He was describing Mastodon's riffs as a whole on all their albums but this comment was made on a Curl of the Burl upload. Well, a Mastodon fan that actually liked the album. That description makes The Hunter even better. This record is a real treat if you take the time to hear it's beauty. I can see where Brent and Troy are going with their vocals. They still scream on this album and get heavy (Blasteroid being a prime example) but not on every single track and it's not a bad thing.<br /><br />Troy's vocals (I believe for most of the song, that's Troy singing) on Dry Bone Valley are amazing, the guy can belt it out. Same with Brent. I mean, don't you think they'd start to take interest in wanting to brush up on their clean vocals a bit more? They're honing their vocal skills, that's all and it paid off. So to sum it up, this is a great progressive sludge metal album, although leaning a bit into rock. It doesn't sound anything like Leviathan, so I'd advise learning a bit more about experimentation before you pick this album up. If you take the time, open up your mind and widen your musical horizons, this record really is something to behold. Bravo, Mastodon./><br />Troy's vocals (I believe for most of the song, that's Troy singing) on Dry Bone Valley are amazing, the guy can belt it out. Same with Brent.

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|First of all, Prometheus is a prequel. It takes place, many years, before the events of Alien.<br /><br />There are Space Jockeys. What they are and what their intentions seem to be, are partially, explained. By the end of the film, there are still many questions to be answered. Its obvious there is more to be told and revealed in another film.<br /><br />If you're hoping to see facehuggers, chestbursters and xenomorphs (full-grown Aliens), well, you do get to see some creatures, but none of them are recognizable. In fact, these creatures seem to be early versions of the Aliens or the original creatures that the Aliens came from. These creatures have elements of the Aliens and are no doubt, related.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot, but know the planet and the Jockeys are not the same that are seen in Alien. This is a different planet and these Jockey ships aren't carrying eggs.<br /><br />Now, people who have seen the film say it lacks character development and the film is overall, disappointing. I agree that the film is a little slow and doesn't have a lot of action, but the action scenes, including a self-surgical procedure scene, are intense.<br /><br />The cinematography and visual effects are stunning, as well as designs and sets. The production is just fantastic.<br /><br />The acting is well done, especially, by Michael Fassbender as \\"David\\", Noomi Rapace as \\"Elizabeth Shaw\\", and Charlie Theron as \\"Meredith Vickers\\".<br /><br />The story/script is kind of frustrating to follow, due to many questions it proposes, but I thought the pacing was ok. It felt like it was quicker than Alien's and that has to do with less character development scenes (which honestly, Alien was rather light on character development).<br /><br />I understand that people were disappointed that this was not \\"Alien\\" and I agree, to an extent, but that was  not the intention of Ridley and the writers, to make another Alien film. It's a prequel story that takes place at a muchearlier time. There are elements of the franchise, absolutely, but this is it's own prequel story.<br /><br />For what is, I enjoyed it and can't wait to see the answers in the sequel.<br /><br />If you read other reviews that are mixed or negative, I just say don't expect \\"Alien\\". Expect an original prequel story that only asks many questions that will need answers.

B0059WTMLW|4.0|Thus is just a thought, these bad reviews with really bad ratings show show up more &amp; more especially with Amazons free app of the day apps...Alot of people like open feint and ask for it to be added on apps for some reason, I'm wondering if the ppl who say it's adware or spyware really know what it is? Add far as I know developers use that analytic &quot;spyware&quot; to improve their apps to see what people like by seeing what pages/games we like and visit most, collect scores to see how people are doing &amp; they can tell if it's too hard or too easy &amp; stuff like that. I guess i can under stand feeling used or taken  advantage of or whatever because it's not mentioned in the description &amp; they don't tell you up front what there collecting but most of the time you're not given the option to opt out &amp; unless you have an app scanner that tells you which addons are used you don't even know it's there so by them giving the option to turn the stuff off they're letting you know it's there and giving you the choice to opt out. idk what ppl really think they're stealing from you? To me this is different than when developers use  push ads &amp; add stuff to your desktop with out letting you know, with the analytics data they collect they use it to make their apps better for us
B003M5AXN4|5.0|Speed Racer is older than I am, that is, the series ran for 52 episodes in the United States from 1967 -1968 the year I was born. Which means by the time I was 6 or 7 when I began to watch it, the show was already in re-runs. But man, did I love Speed Racer. Admittedly, I probably didn't understand the story very much, but if I had overheard you say, \\"the car acrobatic team\\" or \\"snake oiler\\" I would have known that you were talking about my favorite show.<br /><br />In 2008, the Wachoiski brothers released their version of the franchise, and admittedly I was one of the first few to see it and at the time I was really dissapointed. Being a huge fan of the Wachowski's and their work with the Matrix, I was sure this was going to be an over the top thrill ride. Ever since then, I have not had the opportunity to watch the film again to give it a second chance.  I had always picked the DVD up and stared at it, my inner child telling me to buy it and watch it just one more time.<br /><br />\\"You hated that movie, didn't you?\\" My wife says.<br /><br />\\"Yea,\\" I put it back on the shelf.<br /><br />Well, I wish it hadn't taken me until the blu-ray was only $7 but I bought it to watch it one more time and I am sure glad that I did. Now, looking back - the Wachowski's were ahead of their time! Speed Racer is exactly what it should be, an over the top thrill ride moving at the pace of a T-180!<br /><br />First of all, despite the anime style and the green screen effects, the script and the actors are the heart of this film. If you took away the glam and glitter there would still be a good movie here with a lot of heart. Plus, Matthew Fox does an amazing job mimicking Peter Fernandez from the American voice overs.<br /><br />I think for the critics who said the movie was too cartoony or too fake - it only proves how much the Wachowski's stayed true to the original cartoon. Lots of other movies were already on the market shot in this style: Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, 300 and Sin City to name a few. If they had tried to modernize it like the other franchises have done, I think they would have been equally criticized for \\"changing a classic.\\"<br /><br />The Wachowski's Speed Racer is an awesome movie and deserves a second chance from all of us.y, 300 and Sin City to name a few.

B006RUJST6|5.0|First,  a confession - I don't normally read self-published books.  Honestly, if I had realized when I bought Slammed that it was self-pubbed, I probably wouldn't have bought it... and that would have been my loss.  I really, really liked this book.<br /><br />Slammed is a story about Laken, who's 18 and has just moved to Michigan from Texas at the beginning of her senior year with her mother and 11-year-old brother.  Her father recently died and the family is moving back to her mother's home town.  Moments after she arrives, she meets Will, her across-the-street neighbor.<br /><br />Will - Oh, wow.  Get a comfy chair, carve out some time to read, and prepare to meet your newest fictional boyfriend.  After a bit of flirting, Will takes her on a date to a poetry slam - a stand up poetry competitition.  She learns through his poem that his parents died in an accident, which is how he ended up taking care of his 11-year-old brother.  (Yes, Laken and Will's brothers quickly become BFFs and they're adorable together)<br /><br />So, I'm reading along, enjoying the intro to their relationship then... OH SNAP!  I did not see the conflict coming and couldn't imagine how they're going to fix it... without giving spoilers, it's a doozy.<br /><br />Added to Laken and Will's romantic problems is Laken's anger at her mother for moving, and other issues that change the path of Laken's life forever.  The back-and-forth between Laken and her mother was well-written and real - teen angst vs parental wisdom.<br /><br />Add the secondary characters:  Laken and Will's brothers, Laken's BFF Eddie, and some fantastic poems, and you've got a book for the Keeper Shelf.  Trust me on this.  I picked this book up hoping for a good, angsty teen read but what I got was so much more. (I haven't had to hold back tears while reading a book in awhile.)  As soon as I finished I immediately bought the second book in the series, Point of Retreat, which picks up a few months after the events in Slammed (and is told from Will's POV).(and is told from Will's POV).
1576875776|4.0|Like others who have reviewed this book, I too am disappointed by the quality of the printing. But you shouldn't let that prevent you from owning this book. These are the photographs that captured the public's attention, and it's the strength of Maier's artistry that makes this book worth owning, despite its mediocre print quality.<br /><br />Vivian Maier was a genius with a camera. It's only due to blind luck that we know about her work, as she never showed it to anyone during her lifetime. We're fortunate to have her photographs available at all, not to mention in book form. I recommend buying this book now and enjoying it for the wonderful photographs within, and when, years from now, the big expensive coffee table book filled with gorgeous reproductions of Vivian Maier's work does get published, buying that one too. But until then, this book will give you a taste of her amazing talent.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|just a suggestion for game play on your phone...you can get a stylus for touch screens that work very well!  they come in different sizes,  but are generally the size of a pen.... i give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is the first movie that I've written a review on.  I could not pass up the opportunity of letting others know how good Act of Valor is.  This was a fabulous story of sacrifice packed with action and great cinematography.  I'm definitely going to add this to my video library.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Would like to play without sharing popups.  Also would like to  be able to disable the dialog for the entire game.  Otherwise pretty good game.
0670023329|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough.  If you have a strong stomach and are willing to allow the suffering of others to affect you, then read it through and share the story and the book with others.  Something needs to be done by each of us to stop what's happening in North Korea, the world's largest prison.  Wow!
B004LROUW2|5.0|I really couldn't put this book down. It's very long but I found myself reading it without<br />getting bored or anxious for the end. I loved every bit of it!
B0078XMA6O|1.0|There is a couple songs on this album that sound like the cranberries of old. The only problem is it's recorded so hot that I tured it off at track 2. There is no dynamics and that makes it really hard to listen to. They really ruined what could have been a good record.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|HoNk :o)<br />Heyy :3<br />RAWR :F<br />I don't wonna share my opinion so I ain't gonna so I'm just gonna say random crap. * sings Do ya like wafflez song*
1609613937|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading Dr McDougalls \\"history\\" and all the recipes. Have implemented his ideas, and now waiting for the results. Very good book. The recipes are simple and inexpensive, so people can see it does NOT cost more to eat a starch/plant based diet.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Bought this for my wife who just loved the show and was a great surprise for her. Each season comes in its own sleeve with designs on it with the characters. Also comes with the Gilmore girls lingo book in case you need it for reference. Great padded cover that surrounds the dvd's.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the idea that this caculator is right there at a touch. when I need it . I don't have to look everywhere and can't find it. At my age that's a plus.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great collection well worth it. Blu-ray quality is as crisp as it gets!! Phenomenal book like holder that the disc's are stored in, great looking drawings of characters in the disc holders all around. Alot of extra footage and booklet regarding the movies. A collection a true fan would appreciate and would make a great gift even if it was to yourself like I did.
B007P06DJ0|5.0|Not one for doing this very often, I felt compelled after reading the above review.  Played the vinyl and was totally impressed with this mastering.  My album is quiet and the sound is fantastic. No need to go into details regarding the music, other than to say that this is a great album for listening to different elements of sound on your system.  If you like this album and enjoy superior sound quality, get this vinyl release, you will be showcasing your system with some of these tracks.
0345803485|5.0|Great book, hard to put down, must read for women, definitly recomend, not for prudish types. Fresh new twist. can't wait to start book 2
B0086700CM|5.0|i couldn't believe my eyes when it finally clef out for the kindle! it's really nice that it's free. you will LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This trilogy is a MUST read for any woman!  The book is amazing.  It's a modern day Romeo and Juliet with lots of kinky stuff thrown into the mix.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|it used to be great but the second time we'd draw the game stopped playing now whenever I try to play the game doesn't load.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I would give this book 100 stars if I could.  Easily my favourite in the whole trilogy.  Who says romance is dead?  If you've read the first book,don't hesitate in buying the second.
B0086700CM|3.0|temple run is fun and addicting not to mention free but, on my kindle fire it has lots of glitches like sometimes I try to turn it pauses then throws my charecter off the trek.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|thank you thank you thank you el james for this amazing trilogy.  all the mum's at school are talking about it lol.  lots of suspense in this third book.  the perfect way to finish off this great trilogy.
B0086700CM|3.0|its awesome but it freezes sometimes when I'm jumping. and when I turn I fall. they shhould fixit because I'm not in love with it
030758836X|5.0|The only thing that I didn't like about reading this book is that it ended and I can't seem to pick up another book without being dissapointed.  Ms. Flynn has woven an amazing story and created complex characters, who, at some point during the book, you grow to both love and hate.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Cross \\"Fifty Shades\\" off your list.  Save yourself the unbelievable characters, elementary writing style and wandering plot.  Pick up \\"Gone Girl\\" and clear your calendar, you won't put it down until the last page is turned.<br /><br />The only problem then, is figuring out what to read next...
B005FISC52|5.0|One Tree Hill is my favourite show of all time, this was the perfect end to a perfect show. A must have for any fan.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I haven't seen the movie because I wanted to read the book first.  Once you start it's a quick read because you can't put it down.  It compels you to keep reading until the end.  Now I'm compelled to read the other two in the series even though I thought just the one would be enough.  I'm not particularly fond of the idea of people, let alone young people, killing each other in a survival contest, but I think she handles it well and avoids being gruesome.  I downloaded this Kindle edition the morning just before I left for the airport for a three week cruise.  Slick, quick and easy, and so convenient to take on a trip.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is awesome!!!! I'm soooooo happy they got this for the kindle fire!!!! I love it!!! its soooooo much fun!!! enjoy :)
B006P96PAO|5.0|Started off a little slow but really got better and better to where I was almost upset when it was done! Props to the folks who made/financed this production! Thank you!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Many works of literature/film that try to make unexpected twists and turns fall into either: 1) incredibly predictable or 2) completely unbelievable.  Hugh Howey does niether, and is able to hide the ball just well enough to keep you guessing.  Excellent writer.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|nothing outstanding but not terrible. controls are somewhat awkward. nice variety of games to choose from. gets annoying to replay games to get points.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|great game with amazing graphics.  stays challenging just like the other flick golf game, but also just like the last game the point levels get a little unrealistic as you get further up
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen at his best, as good as \\"Bullets Over Broadway\\", \\"Match Point\\", \\"Radio Days\\".  Who better to bring us back to the Paris of the '20s, of Ernest Hemmingway, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein, the Fitzgeralds?  My only concern, and perhaps it's just me, maybe my DVD?  But are the colors in this production overly-saturated?  Was it intentional?  Is it a defect in the production?  I'd be interested in the opinion of others, please.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|I have to admit i approached this one with caution,<br /><br />Like many i discovered Melody in 2009 with Baby Im A Fool and took the plunge with the album \\"My One And Only Thrill\\".. I'm not a jazz fan per se so that album took me a while to get into and really appreciate but after a couple of months, i really came to love that album and found lots to enjoy on her debut \\"Worrisome Heart\\" too..<br /><br />When I heard she was taking in lots of world music influences, saw the cover and heard Mira and saw all the foreign language titles in the tracklist, I kinda thought maybe i should pass on this one...<br /><br />Im glad I decided to give it a go... I downloaded it and my immediate reaction was maybe this isnt for me, it is quite removed from the orchestral-led music of her last album... But i persevered and gave it  a couple of days to really appreciate it and I have to say I'm really enjoying what Melody has brought to the table this time<br /><br />I was sceptical about her tampering with her sound after the breakout success of her last album, i kinda felt it was too soon but now i can see where she was coming from... this is authentic music, heartfelt and sincere, raw and beautiful ... there are many splashes of world music influences throughout yet it still feels like Melody of old... the music may be critiqued for being all very mellow and slow in tempo, but it works, she makes you feel every word in the lyrics... the songs dont drift over you as bland , you really feel like you are being carried away to exotic places and yet still you feel the sincerity and heartfelt  emotion in her lyrics...<br /><br />I think Melody has really done a fine job here and this, like her last album, is gonna be one im gonna listen to for a long time to come i can feel already<br /><br />Personal faves are the lively and lilting Imenja , the beautiful Amalia and the heartfelt So We Meet Again My Heartache...<br /><br />If you have enjoyed Melody's work to date, Dont be put off bythe idea of all sorts of world music influences or some foreign language lyrics, Melody has stayed true to herself and you know every word comes from the heart and the music itself is soothing and relaxing like the albums before but in a slightly different way... yes , there is a different feel to the music than straight up jazz but it works, and it works well<br />Also, Many people say track 3 is ruined by the clicking noise that seems out of sync with the rest of the music, I personally dont find it so... yes it seems a little quirky on first listen but it still is a beautiful song that can be enjoyed regardless<br /><br />Also, i downloaded  the album and there is no time gap of 14 minutes on my version between track 11 and 12...<br /><br />I highly recommend this album<br /><br />I cant believe i was thinking of passing on this one....im glad i gave it a go and had patience to really try to appreciate the music...<br />enjoy
B0079J28NW|5.0|I remember seeing Yellow Submarine twice in a theater on my 20th birthday (which means I'm almost 64, whew!).  My daughter loved it on VHS and the grandkids have recently been watching it over and over on DVD.  My three-year old grandson no longer asks for the Wiggles, just the Beatles and Yellow Submarine.  I just received the Blu-ray version today and I won't add anything to the previous reviews on the sound and video quality other than to say that it's incredible to watch and hear.  So to all you Boomers out there, share this with your kids and grandkids.  Just be prepared for multiple viewings.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Well lets see i see this movie about four years ago and it still good. Specail since i know females who are just like this they have the itch but they dont have fits but all the same issues and all over when it comes to love or making love. But almost anything Mr.Jackson is in is good but snakes on a plane that was a waste of good film. But tell a story most ppl have never seen or paid attention to which is woman and or young ladies who have emotional problem due to past drama and trama and parent denile about what happened. It covers alot of those issues.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|not bad to waste time for a little while but I got bored by the time i got to the first boss fight. if your waiting for your doctor to call u in its worth the download
B003FXXNH6|4.0|Well it had fair action it good a pretty good plot i didnt see that ending coming but the part where he hop of down the road is kinda more fun the like joy is the filling but i would have loved to see more or the boxer special style and skill set and a match between him and boyka or however u spell his name and idk bout u but it seems the russians have got their eye on black ppl they tryin to be friend us alot more in movies lately but idk a black russian that would be a monster in the ring lol but the but how boyka finished the last guy to win was to cartoon and CG could have ended that better if i hadnt seen part two i probably would have liked it more but still a good picture
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Case has a nice matte feel to it. Fits perfectly, I do wish the elastic strap didn't cover the right top speaker. (I was hoping to have my Pandora app going with the case closed, but it covers a speaker - not a big deal, just bugs me) Also, I was expecting the front cover to be white, but it is black,  the picture is a little misleading. It is a nice sleek addition to the fire overall.<br /><br />would give 5 stars but the white case gets dirty, and the matte finish is REALLY hard if not impossible to clean :(
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked the game a lot on my boyfriends iphone but when I got it for my kindle fire, it has some glitches and timing issues with a lot of the games.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was waiting forever for this game to come to the amazon appstore and now it's here! I play it all the time!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I have a fairly large collection of movies on my home computer that I have copied from disks that I own. I wanted a way to be able to access these movies everywhere and anywhere: computers, TV's, phones, etc. Plex does it perfectly. I can know use my Android phone as a remote for my PC or simply stream my movies to my phone wherever I am. Great job to the devs for finally making an app worthy of paying for.<br /><br />I have also installed Plex for GoogleTV. The only downside is the Android remote is only supported for PC's and Mac's so hopefully soon they will update it where i can control Plex on the GoogleTV. This would make the app a killer.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|This is not my first copy of this Study Bible. I already own two ESV Study Bibles in print. Having this on my Kindle is very convenient. All of the study notes of the printed version, the ability to change the font size,and the ability to take this places where a rather large Study Bible would be burdensome make this perfect for me. It not ony meets my expectations, it exceeds them, and for the low price that I paid I really can't think of anything negative to say about it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So glad I found this series!  Have stayed up late reading every night because I could not put it down.  Even took it to work one day and read during a slow time because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Author did an excellent job with characters and descriptions of the areas and action.  Hope the series will continue.  I have been looking for a new science fiction series and this exceeded my expectations! Certainly not a predictable story.  Great twists I didn't see coming.  Hope the movie--if one is made--sticks to the book and doesn't make unnecessary changes.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was a little adament about reading this book because it's not the genre of books I normally ready but u decided to give it a try. I could not put these books down. Definitely recommend to all ages!
1402210086|4.0|This is my 13th Georgette Heyer book.  What I like best about her books is the outstanding characterization, witty dialogue, realistic historical details, and \\"clean\\" content (nothing more sexual than a briefly mentioned kiss).<br /><br />Cotillion is the story of a young girl named Kitty who will inherit a large fortune from her guardian as long as she marries one of his great-nephews.  Kitty loves one of her cousins who has never seemed to return her interest, so she begs another cousin Freddy to pretend to be engaged to her, mainly to make the first cousin jealous.  There are all sorts of machinations and funny shenannigans that result from this scenario, especially since Freddy is an unusual hero in that he's not too bright.<br /><br />The ending is what I felt made this book only good instead of excellent.  The eventual falling-in-love that results doesn't seem quite believeable.  It's kind of a case of Heyer having told us they love each other, without actually showing it to us in their actions.  It's not that their actions contradict this declaration of love, but they don't actively support it either.  There are also words exchanged and a brief fisticuffs over a girl, in which everything is okay between the two men entirely too easy in a way that's not quite believable.<br /><br />Still, this was an enjoyable book, and certainly worthwhile for the Heyer fan.  I do prefer some of her other books better, namely [[ASIN:1402238770 A Civil Contract]], [[ASIN:1402217706 The Nonesuch]], [[ASIN:1402219482 The Foundling]], [[ASIN:1402217684 Cousin Kate]], and [[ASIN:1402217951 Why Shoot a Butler?]].
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is a dystopian novel set in 2044.  Due to global warming and the energy crisis, industrialized nations are collapsing.  People escape into the Oasis, an immersive Internet world, where players are able to build the lives they wish they had in reality.  When the 1980's-obsessed inventor of the Oasis dies, he leaves his fortune to the winner of a virtual contest within the Oasis.  High school senior Wade Watts is determined to win this fortune- and the most epic video game of all.<br /><br />I enjoyed this fast-paced read because of the incredible world building, the 1980's pop culture references, and the mysterious clues within the contest.  I even found myself trying to solve the riddles along with Wade.  The characters demonstrate inspiring perseverance and sacrifice in their quest, and teenage and adult readers alike will enjoy the game contained within this story.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I had to write a review of this one. I saw it in the theater, not sure if I would like it or not, b/c as many others have attested, the previews and advertising were hard to make sense of. Long story short, though, it was one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences that I have had in a long time. I was thoroughly impressed with pretty much every aspect of this film, and I highly recommend it, especially if you have been holding off so far. One thought that kept coming to mind was, \\"this is what the first two Star Wars prequels (which I found quite disappointing) *wish* they could have been like (but were not).\\" Not that a direct comparison is warranted, but John Carter uses visual effects technology in the best possible way, to drive the story in a captivating manner that transports you to another place. Additionally, if like me you have not read the source material (\\"Princess of Mars\\" by ERB), the film will actually have some surprising plot twists and things that keep you wondering, which is always nice. It was/is a terrible shame that this performed so poorly at the box office, because it is such a well made film, and everyone who worked on it should be given great credit for not losing the quality at all when working on such a big project. Many films of far inferior quality have made way more money, and this one should have had so much going for it. Blame the poor advertising, I guess. Even the DVD cover art is horrible, in my opinion. I would not watch a movie if I had to decide based on cover art like that. But this one is so good. Just give it a shot.
0756655307|2.0|The encyclopedia is good but arrived crushed and broken, and was for a gift. bad luck because it is very nice.
B0058VW36U|5.0|no game could beat this one. love it sooooooo much . I would be mad if I found out if someone didn't like it.
B00846TRHY|2.0|This is a truly unsatisfying biography.  It is part Rambo, part comic book, and highly unfocused. One of the worst scripts for a movie in recent years.  As a film it does not work. The scenes are chopped together like a bad home movie.  At one point the hero is banging his wife against the wall of their home.  The scene changes and we see him preaching.  If you are appealing to Christians this probably will not work.  The timeline is a confused mess.  The Childers character bounces from Africa to America and back like a deranged soccer ball.  However,  it gets people to think about and educate themselves about the terrible things happening in Africa. Not just the Sudan but thru out Africa people are at war with one another in the most horrible way.  It is sad that this kind of thing has been going on for years and yet people only sit up and take notice when the story hits Youtube or gets made into a Hollywood movie.  Hotel Ruwanda was a far better film. I would have give this film a raspberry one star but I hope that folks will go beyond this vapid stunted film and do some reading on what is truly happening in the world.  I also hope to see an interview somewhere with Childers to get a better version of the story.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very addicting. I was excited when they finally came out with it for the kindle fire. this is an amazing game
B005USZYDU|3.0|I purchased this book to see if my 12 year old daughter might enjoy reading it over the summer.  The characeters were all quirky, but generally likeable and the story seemed like one that was moving along nicely.  I bought the kindle version, so I really did not realize I was getting to the end until I was literally on the last page.  I swiped my finger to turn to the next page and it wouldn't turn.  I thought I had not downloaded it correctly because there was NO ENDING.  It just stopped.  I was so mad.  I didn't read the other two books, but I don't think I will.  Kids books are known for completion within a single book.  And although the story was good, it was a real let down that it ended so poorly.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game has good if repetitive graphics. it is challenging and fast. it doesn't take long to learn all you need to know.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this game.....something different when bored with other games. Wish there were more to play on this but still fun going back trying to beat your old score.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is an awesome app!! It is good for Kindle Fire and iTouch. And it is free!! AWESOME APP!! I Reccomend Highly.
0345803485|1.0|Not sure what all the hype is about. Not a very good read in my opinion. I was disappointed to say the least.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Thank you for updating this app! Its compatible with the kindle hd now and im super excited, now if the rest of my apps would update It would be nice.
1441869980|4.0|I'm a huge Harry Dresden fan and have been searching for another series to read while waiting for the next Dresden.<br /><br />I know that some people didn't like how the book begins with a hipster 2100 year old that looks and acts 21, but for me it worked. I also could see, after 2000 years, how someone might not get all that worked up when people are killed. So as long as you can check your own feelings about that at the door, things will be fine.<br /><br />I'm curious to see how things turn out in Book 2. I've already picked it up so we'll see!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Perhaps the truest film adaptation of any Edgar Rice Burroughs story. Ambitious, epic, and a ton of fun. It's not without a few flaws, but those can be overlooked because the rest of the movie is so much fun. Don't listen to the critics who panned this. These are the same people who like bland, derivative dreck.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Having just finished this book not 10 minutes ago..I had to stop and give a review.<br />Bear with me, I'm not a real reviewer..there's no Amazon gold star next to my name.<br />But I am a reader. Avid. Like, 1-2 books a week for 25 years(with some years skipped).<br />Never, ever, have I been so absorbed by a book. The palpable tension, the roller-coaster plot, the DEEP dive into the mind of Man, mind of a Woman, the dynamic of a marriage .... all make this a book that will a) make your skin crawl b) make you think hard about good & evil or c) wonder what the heck your better half is really thinking.  Oh yes, it's a love story.<br />This story demanded my complete attention in the 3 days it took to read.<br />And while I could glimpse the ending before the ending, it was still a rare treat to read the book until the last page.<br />Wow.<br />On another note: I'm in a bind. Coincidentally I have a  good friend who's celebrating her 5 year anniversary, and while her and I share similar taste in books,this book is not for the squeamish or easily offended. So much so that I'll think hard before I giving it as a gift...
B007Z9QS5K|1.0|I absolutely love my roku and the access it gives me to instant movies. However, this is one movie that I'm sorry I had access to.  A lot of stars and no substance-VERY dissatisfied:(
B0013F1D02|5.0|I admit when I first looked at this movie, I thought the name was a little weird and didn't really recognize any actors in it so I was gonna skip over but I decided to watch the trailer for it on youtube and I was like, \\"This could be interesting.\\" It was....it had good comedy good cinematics with the landscapes and magic. good storyline too. This is one of those movies that make a great date movie. Both the guy and the girl can sit, relax, laugh, and enjoy the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|yes deffenitly get the game my friends have the iphone and ipod and now kindel has it I love it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the game, but takes to long to get energy to complete tasks. wish that could change. or have a larger amount of energy.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like this game, as the skill levels can be adjusted at the beginning of a game quite easily.  You can even name your opponent, using an evil nemesis, spouse, or friend.  I would have liked to know what pieces have been taken by both sides for easier tracking, but what can we expect from a free game?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best I've read in a while. Love the story, very well written. One of those can't wait to finish, but don't want it to end books. Excited to read more by Mr. Howey!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is one of the best game ive played in awhile! A must for all kindle fire users!  Will keep u occupied for days!
B00003CX95|4.0|When i first got the movie in the mail it was well packeged. The movie also was great. I gave it 4 stars because this movie was great, it followed history pretty well,but keep in mind this is a hollywood movie the dialouge was off for the time period.<br /><br />Movie:<br />The movie starts with William as a kid, when his Dad and brother were killed. His uncle came and trained him for awhile. William came back to find his countryman still under Engish. He went back not for his countryman but for a girl but soon enough his love dies and he goes after the english. As this story goes on you will be very pleased with the story and special effects and acting.<br /><br />Mel Gibson:<br />Wore three hats as directer, producer, and star. Mel did very great in his role anyone buying this movie will be very happy with the results.<br />Hope that was helpful.
0345529057|4.0|I bought this for my boyfriend cause he really wanted to read it.  It would have been amazing if it had arrived on time, but he seems to be happy with it.
B00005N6KG|2.0|The sound is good. The fit is good. The wire is terrible. They last a few weeks and then break - maybe OK for super-gentle listening, but movement yanks the connections loose, either at the earpiece or the connector. Opened a new one which had a dead channel. Sent it to the warranty address on the package - it was returned as-is. No more.<br />Update: Despite my objections, I decided to order another pair of these. Now they're $39!, not the $9 or so that was already over-priced. What are Sony and/or Amazon thinking? Got to be a joke. No more, no way. Instead, look at the Koss KPH13 (at $9). Looks nearly identical, sounds as good.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|The Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve is a great way to keep the screen ``dust-free`` and also makes carrying the Kindle easier.
B0062GM6FS|4.0|A genuine hoot. Keef is supposed to be long dead, a genuinely surprising survivor, the half of the Glimmer Twins for whom there seemed to be only music and a narrow path to self-destruction but who, like Ishmael, lived to tell the tale. And settle some scores. And to here, between the covers of the this very book, provide master classes on rock and blues guitar, tunings, being a Stone, traveling as a junkie (is there a book, \\"The Traveling Junkie\\"? Until there is, this is it), rock performance in venues of various sizes, and scores of observations on various personalities, famous and otherwise, members of the entourage, their girlfriends, musicians of every stripe, and, of course, Mick. And Mick. (And Mick.)<br /><br />And Life in general from a guy who's lived a few.<br /><br />It reads in Keef's voice, and you know from the lyrics and Rolling Stone, UK press, and other interviews that there's a reflective man inside that craggy, road-worn exterior, but you may still wonder, as did I, how much of the substantive and expressive load packed into these page is carried to the table by James Fox, who turned Richards' story into a book.<br /><br />No matter. A ripping yarn, an authentic voice, and a rock biography that smacks of brutally self-effacing candor, humor, insight, occasional sweetness (as in his charming account of his road romance with Ronnie Bennett, who most readers will know by the name she took a few years later: Ronnie Spector), and, of course, a stirring I-was-there account of how six (yes, six) London lads (okay: neither Brian Jones nor Ian Stewart were Londoners, the others were...but they were LIVING in London) became a legendary rock'n'roll band. Again: smashing.
B006UG90RM|3.0|Van Halen released their twelfth album “A Different Kind of Truth” in 2012. This album is the first time that Eddie and Alex collaborated with Dave since 1996, and not surprisingly had many Van Halen fans wetting their pants in anticipation. Sadly, I simply do not see the five-star album that so many other reviewers have posted. I am in no way bashing anyone’s opinion of the album, mind you, but I have cranked this for years now and it still just sounds like a bunch of demos that were cracked out of the vault to get a record to the masses.<br /><br />“A Different Kind of Truth,” to me, is nowhere near the classic Roth-era Van Halen albums of 1978-1984. The songs do not resonate like the classic albums, the subtraction of Michael Anthony’s vocals and bass playing are prominent, and the production often leaves me wondering if this is cheaply produced or simply the way things are done nowadays. Now before every Roth-era Van Halen fan hangs an effigy of me on their street corner for burning, I am a huge Van Halen fan and eagerly anticipated this album as much as they, but it simply isn’t as amazing as it was pumped up to be. The album isn’t garbage, mind you, but it surely isn’t “1984” or “Van Halen I” as some fans are proclaiming. Some of the albums tracks are decent and add something to the Van Halen catalogue: “She’s the Woman,” “Big River” and “Tattoo” are favorites from the album, and others are worth a listen as well. My only problem with the album is that I went in mind already blown, and was let down quite a bit by “A Different Kind of Truth.” If you go into this record with little to no expectations than you may actually be surprised, just be careful if you’re expecting class Roth-era Van Halen.<br /><br />I won’t discourage any Van Halen fan from buying this album in the least; in fact, if you’re a huge ‘Diamond’ Dave fan than you’ll want this record in your collection. However, to the objective Van Halen fans out there just be cautious when purchasing this record.cord.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I have never been so excited for a movie in recent memory.  I am a HUGE fan of the Alien franchise (except the 4th movie and the AvP series).  I have the graphic novels, I have toy models, I have books, etc.  On that 7th of June I had told my wife that if she did not find a babysitter I would watch that movie with or without her.  I explained that the excitement for this movie pre-dated her and that nothing would prevent me from seeing it at midnight.  I turned my back on over 200 dollars in overtime and inpatiently awaited 0000 hrs (military).  I never drink but that night I took my wife out and we had a few drinks as a celebration to my straight up nerdiness.  0000 hrs. approached, I put on my 3D IMAX glasses and........<br /><br />2 hours later it was over. Everybody got up, my wife lay there asleep on my shoulder (she's a trooper), and I looked over to my buddy (also an Alien fan).  We both still had our glasses on but both could see each other's disappointed face.  We got up and I think the only think we said to each other was \\"it was alright i guess.\\"<br /><br />It did not stop there.  The following day I could not stop thinking about it.  The movie was said to be a film set in the Alien universe, but that's it.  Ridley Scott was not kidding when he said this.  I refused to believe Ridley Scott, hoping he was going to surprise us.  That is where the problem began.  I went into the film refusing to believe the director's warning/advice as to the prequel issue.  When the credits rolled my initial reaction was \\"WTF....NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!.\\"  The next day I went out and upgraded to the Blu-ray Alien collection (yes I know, a real fan should've had it already.  But I have a family on a Police Officer's salary).  I watched the films and just sat there and analyzed Prometheus over and over.  I came to realization that the movie had left me in awe.  The initial reactions was that of anger that there was no Aliens of Facehuggers.  After that wore off I began to think of itas a Science Fiction film that takes place in the Alien universe, just like we (Alien fans) have been instructed to do so by the director himself.  I am actually excited for future sequels now.  One thing that I do wish for is an extended editiion Blu-Ray, as the film does seem poorly edited at times.  The film has a strange eerie qality to it.  The scenery is absolutely gorgeous.  On IMAX 3D it absolutely leaves your jaw on the floor.<br /><br />This isn't really a straight up review. It's more like a warning to anybody that has not seen it and is expecting an Alien prequel.  So far, everybody I have talked to has experienced the same range of emotions I have.  If you are one of the ones who is going to watch it because the previews \\"looked cool\\" you will probably want your money back.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite science fiction films.  If any of these films are on your list then this film is for you:<br /><br />*Blade Runner<br />*Alien<br />*Aliens<br />*Alien 3 (had a similar disappointing response initally, only recently have I grown to appreciate this film)<br />*2001 A Space Odyssey<br />*The Thing<br />*District 9

B005EXA8XC|4.0|Make sure you buy the dvd over the blu ray... The blu ray is horribly out of sync.. I returned the blu ray twice just to make sure. Dvd is just fine..Waited for this release  for ever. Footage, sound and sync is great.  I was under the impression that the DVD version had music videos.. Not on my disc.. That's why I gave it a 4. Enjoy!
B0086700CM|1.0|I hare temple run si much,  because whenever I try ti jump it wont. its like it has a glitches or something. do not get this game, its pointless.
B005PTYOTE|4.0|This set includes the first three MI movies in one BluRay set.  The picture and sound quality is very good.  (Note that my max resolution is 720p. I cannot comment on 1080p.)  I have a 5.1 channel system and the movies really work well in my environment.  It is easy to get engrossed in them.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|The good: it's nice to get something of the back-story on the Alien franchise.  I appreciate the cast's efforts.  The movie looks very nice in spots, although the humanoid aliens seem rather smaller scale than what was portrayed in the brief glimpses from the first Alien movie.  Very good sound design.  The pacing is OK.  It's a meager list.<br /><br />The complaints are that the movie abounds with impenetrable character motivations, one-dimensional characters, few real surprises, wooden dialog, and logical holes at every turn.  Regarding the last, if there is one thing that is expected of SciFi is that, within the imagined story and setting, the actions of the characters makes logical sense.  A lot of fairly intelligent people watch this genre and cannot abide by this lack of coherence.<br /><br />I don't want to go into detail so as to cause spoilers, but when watching this I'm constantly mystified along the lines of, \\"For what possible reason did A do such-and-such to B?\\", \\"Why didn't X happen to B if X happened to A?\\",  \\"How can A possibly know where B is going so as to warn C\\", \\"Why does an obviously superior-intelligent A freak out upon meeting a bunch of B?\\", \\"After apparently thousands of years, why does A immediately want to go to planet B instead of getting a bite to eat first and maybe taking a shower or something?\\"...etc, etc.<br /><br />The few action scenes seem pointless and/or gratuitous rather than instrumental to any kind of plot.<br /><br />We have yet another amazing, scheming robot, yawn.  The actress doing the Ripley thing is definitely giving her all and then some, but it all seems staged and forced compared to Ms. Weaver's grunting, gasping, and straining through similar situations.<br /><br />Yet, wading through all of this, possibly the worst is being handed a \\"hey kiddies, get out another 9 bucks for Prometheus II\\" ending, an offense all four prior Alien movies never came close to.<br /><br />Quite disappointed. 2.5/5
B0027BOL4G|3.0|Not the best documentary I have seen on this topic but it was still well produced and informative. I liked the footage of factory farming the most. I wish it hadn't tried to cover so many topics because it meant that no one topic was explored adequately.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|It is an absolute travesty that Americans have not fully embraced Keane like they embraced U2 and Coldplay and even The Killers. For it is from those seeds that Keane's music has taken shape. Of course there's also Travis as well. But the bottom line remains: Keane are far more popular in their native England than they are here. I mean, all of their albums have gone number one there. Can any American name any song from Keane? I still have people with furrowed brows say to me, \\"Keane? Who is that?\\"<br /><br />I am biased, of course, every so often I find a band or artist that, to my ears, can do no wrong. Keane is one of those bands, and I'd even go so far as to give them an edge over Coldplay. With their fourth album, \\"Strangeland\\", the band continues to make great melodic piano driven music. They've always reminded me of my favorite era in music, the new wave/punk movement of the late 70's and early 80's. These guys really know how to make melodies that are memorable and that soar, always stadium friendly.<br /><br />The deluxe version has four extra tracks. Without them there is a five star album here. With them, there's still a five star album here. Sure, there are songs that stand out from the pack, and all of these that I'm about to name should easily shoot into the American top 10. Songs like \\"You Are Young\\", \\"Silenced By The Night\\", \\"Sovereign Light Cafe\\", \\"On The Road\\", \\"The Starting Line\\", \\"Neon River\\" and even \\"Sea Fog\\". I think the only songs that might falter are \\"Watch How You Go\\", \\"Black Rain\\", \\"Day Will Come\\", \\"The Boys\\" and \\"It's Not True\\", but really, there are no weak tracks to be heard here. Everything is given a meticulous production and melodic sheen.<br /><br />Now, some critics have complained that \\"Strangeland\\" finds the band spinning its wheels and not pushing forward musically like they did on their last album, 2008's \\"Perfect Symmetry\\". Well that may be true, but there is no shortage of exciting material to be had here. Perhaps the band did go back to 2004's \\"Hopes And Fears\\" for some inspiration, but that was also a great album. In fact, Keane have yet to make a misstep musically. All of their albums are great.<br /><br />So, \\"Strangeland\\" gets five stars from me, something I don't often give out, because there are no songs that I can readily point to that tarnish the shine found throughout the album. It's cohesive musically and thematically.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Strangeland\\" compares to Keane's previous works:<br /><br />2004 Hopes And Fears: Four Stars<br />2006 Under The Iron Sea: Four and a Half Stars<br />2008 Perfect Symmetry: Five Stars<br />2010 Night Train (EP): Three Stars<br />2012 Strangeland: Five Starsd go back to 2004's \\"Hopes And Fears\\" for some inspiration, but that was also a great album.

0486275590|5.0|Jim Hawkins is the young hero who comes into possession of a treasure map leading to the golden hoard of an infamous pirate.  Hawkins enlists the help of a reputable doctor and his servants in going after the treasure, but one of the servants blabs too much, which attracts the interest of the pirate's former crew.  The former pirates sign on with Jim Hawkins and company in their new ship and plot to mutiny once the treasure is attained.  Due to fortuitous events young Mr. Hawkins stumbles on the pirates' plan and warns his compatriots, and the rest of the book is a tense standoff between honest crewmembers and pirates.  I won't tell you who wins, but the most fascinating character in the book is Long John Silver, the pirate captain's former quartermaster, who plays both sides in a constant back-and-forth that ultimately sours Jim on him and earns him the enmity of the honest men in the crew.  As the pirates and the honest men fight it out it is never clear who is going to win and who is doomed to fail and be killed or left behind on Treasure Island.<br /><br />This book is a gripping adventure yarn that starts out fast-paced and never lets up.  Its terse, tense storytelling style plays pirates against the honest crew members in a series of bloody face-offs that sees many men killed and others greviously wounded.  All through the book you wonder if Jim is going to find the pirate treasure or if he's going to get perforated before he gains so much as a penny.  Jim takes many risks along the way and gets lucky a couple of times, and in the end he wins through, though not without some scars (physical and emotional) picked up along the way.  This tale won popular acclaim in the Victorian age and continues to fascinate today with its bold story and action-adventure, and I can well see it retaining its charm a hundred years from today.  It's written for young adult boys but should be appealing for anyone, even younger children, who want an exciting story of piracy and the hunt for pirate gold.  The footnotes are of great value with all the pirate-talk, which I otherwise wouldn't have understood, but there aren't a lot of notes and they're easy to pick up on.  Read this tale, and enjoy!hunt for pirate gold.

0547569653|4.0|I'm a marathon runner and I'm a vegan, so I've a soft spot for Scott Jurek. I've seen him speak twice in person and he seems like a nice guy, and his memoir hasn't changed my opinion of him. He's made an enormous contribution to distance running, and shown that you can be a world champion on a vegan diet! He doesn't shy away from the \\"v\\" word, but he doesn't talk much about animal welfare (he initially became a vegan for health and environmental reasons).<br /><br />I hadn't realized that Scott had grown up in such difficult circumstances. His family was not wealthy, his mother got multiple sclerosis very young, and his father was obviously not able to cope with it and lashed out at everyone. I would have liked to have heard more about the father, but the relationship has obviously broken down completely. Scott was a good boy, got great grades, and took to skiing and then running well. The book describes his runs and the challenges he faced in training and accomplishing his record-breaking feats. He's clearly very competitive and tough (it's clear that you have to be to weather the physical challenges of running 100+ mile races over forbidding terrain), but he's also a quester, humbled by the natural world, and in love with the brother- (and sisterhood) of ultramarathoners.<br /><br />Thankfully, the book is free of the dudish, macho tone that marred Born to Run for me--a function of the fact that Scott clearly doesn't feel the need to puff his chest out over his achievements. Born to Run had more science than Eat and Run; Eat and Run has more recipes, and thankfully less of the tough-guy posturing that unfortunately seems to dominate the language of ultrarunning, in spite of the oft-stated quests for transcendence! Yes, Scott has an assholish friend called Dusty who seems to act as his alter ego and shadow side and spurs Scott onto greatness, but he doesn't overwhelm the book. I, for one, could have used less of the puking and bodily malfunctions (why are readers interested in this?) and more attempts to answer the rhetorical questions that litter Eat and Run: particularly, what these runners are trying to prove and what drives them on.
B004S3X9ZS|5.0|Metronomy is a really great band. I needed something fresh and innovative - metronomy came through!  \\"Poppish 80's Euro sound\\" might turn some folks off, but that is a good pidgeon-hole to put Metronomy in. Also ordered \\"Nights Out\\" by same...waiting for it to arrive.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a really cool app because it's free and it comes with so many mini games. I totally recommend this app for someone who gets bored easily because it can keep you busy for hours and hours.
B00505470O|3.0|I listened to some sound clips by this band, Washed Out, and sounded like listenable electronica of a mellow, even tranclike style.  The album is pretty good, but uneven, and I find that I am not listening to it that much. Maybe it's good for sex...haven't tried that yet....
B00030ERII|3.0|If you want to be entertained, watch this movie. If you want to be educated, avoid it like the plague. Whichever academic produced the research for this film should be shot for incompetence. When the Roman general, at the start of the conflict, shouted out 'Roma Victor' instead of the grammatically correct 'Roma Victrix', I knew I was in for a long haul. Whoever heard of anyone being called 'Proximo' ? And how did Maximus get from Germany to Spain so quickly ? The Occidental Express ? The actual gladiatorial scenes were well organised and thought out. It will not escape the viewer that the film is virtually a crib of 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'. For Russell Crowe supply Stephen Boyd, for Joaquin Phoenix supply Christopher Plummer, for Richard Harris supply Alec Guinness, for Connie Nielsen supply Sophia Loren. Add James Mason to this illustrious group and you have people who can act instead of people who 'go over the top'. Phoenix looked no more like Commodus than Jay Robinson like Caligula in 'Demetrius and the Gladiators (the movie, not the pop-group), both of them overacting. Of all the films involving gladiators, Spartacus is still the best. If people aren't convinced by Kirk Douglas, they will be less convinced by Russell Crowe who, whether he plays Maximus or John Nash, is still Russell Crowe.
1849531986|4.0|I like This item because of the lack of words in the book! It was surely the quickest read I ever had! Haha great joking around book
030758836X|3.0|Having never read anything by the author before, I bought this book based on the excellent reviews it's been receiving.  It really took me awhile to get into, and honestly I almost couldn't continue through the main female character's first few diary entries.  My goodness the wordiness.  I skimmed through much of the female's early entries, but the male character's entries held my attention.  The book takes interesting twists and turns, but I did figure out the gist well before the half way point.  I wasn't as blown away by this book as other reviewers, that's for sure, but it was a quick read once it got going.  I read it in the car on a 12 hour drive.  I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.  It's not a bad book by any means.  I just expected something absolutely amazing since so many people are gushing over it.
B0086700CM|3.0|I downloaded this app and I loved it. then it started freezing. I deleted it and tried to download it again. but it wouldn't work. idk Wat's wrong.?

B007WFR1MQ|4.0|This sounds like Fear Factory writing in the 21st century. There are not a pizza delivery service that should compose a &#34;Demanufacture 2&#34; with the same elements that worked in 1995 just to satisfy conservative metalheads. That would be boring.<br /><br />If you only own the mp3 album, I can see how you may not like the last 2 songs. Yet, if own the digipack story booklet, &#34;Religion is Flawed&#34; and &#34;Human Augmentation&#34; sonically makes sense. &#34;Religion is Flawed&#34; song title works as the outro to the &#34;Disassemble&#34; lyrics. If you have an idea of what the album premise is about, the absence of guitars and drums on &#34;Human Augmentation&#34; enhances the drama in this part of the story, visually as you imagine it.<br /><br />Here are the lyrics to &#34;Human Augmentation&#34;, spoken from the automaton's point of view:<br />  I AM A BEING. MY LIFE HAS VALUE<br />  SEEK AS I SEEK, THE SECRET DESIGN<br />  MY PURPOSE IS TO RELATE WITHOUT BITTERNESS, OR PARTIALLY FROM ANY MOTIVES TO WHICH I AM FAR REMOVED<br />  FUELED BY ANTAGONISM, ACCELERATED PANIC, HEADED TOWARDS A CATASTROPHIC EVENT<br />  PENETRATING THOUGHTS, NEGATIVE IMPRESSIONS I DON'T FEEL....<br />  I CANNOT SHED A TEAR FOR ALL THE UNNUMBERED DEAD<br />  DESPERATE AND EXHAUSTED, THE HUMAN CHARACTER LAYS WASTED<br />  LIKE EMOTIONAL DISTORTION, DEATH IS PERCEPTIBLE WITH DEFINABLE FEATURES<br />  I'VE HAD ALL THAT I CAN TAKE, YET THE PAIN REMAINS<br />  MY BODY IS LACERATED, MY MIND IS POISONED<br />  ULTIMATE REVELATIONS....

B0079J28NW|5.0|Wow, just finished watching this blu ray of the newly restored Yellow Submarine, all I can say is that it's incredible!<br />The  beautiful colors and sound are A-1 top notch.<br />I thought the 1999 dvd look great until I saw this brand new frame by frame restoration.<br />The extras on the blu-ray are pretty much the same ones from the 1999 release, but to se the film on blu, is like seeing a brand new print of the film, easliy one of the best reissues/restorations of the year, Paul Rutan Jr. did an excellent restoration, he also was the one who restored Help! and A Hard Days Night years back.<br />The digipack packaging also come with some cool pack-ins as a super cool bonus.<br />I like that the original mono track is included as well as the 5.1 HD and PCM tracks.<br />Kinda a shame that some new bonus features were not included, but that's a very minor quibble.<br /> This blu-ray comes highly recommended!<br /><br />PS, hopefully we will see some more Beatles on blu in the future!

0345803485|3.0|Downloaded the trilogy based on the hype.  Actually read the entire thing!  Skipped over the redundant \\"erotic\\"? scenes which were not the least bit sexy.  The most interesting aspect of the book was Christian's character - figuring out what made him tick.  Very predictable.  Most disappointing.

B005NKGEP2|5.0|I don't typically read this genre, but I thought it was fantastic.<br /><br />This book was a great adventure- a real page turner, full of suspense that kept me on my toes.<br /><br />I love that it was a sort of \\"spy\\" type novel written from a woman's perspective.<br /><br />I loved how the author described things.  Never dwelling on anything too long so that you grew bored, but hitting on the small details of each moment. Before you can blink, you are carried off to the next thrilling moment.<br /><br />This is why I read........the author nailed it.<br /><br />Wish there were another like this book.........

B0086700CM|5.0|This app is awesome! I really like it and had a fun time playing it.  This app is very addicting and brings out a competetive side. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that it was so easy to beat.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game reminds me of the old super mario bros. games for nes. Lep is the new Mario! Great download!
0345803485|1.0|I love books .I have read hundreds of them and almost always finished a book that I started reading. I couldn't this one. The writing was so bad.Very annoyingly repetitious and I did not like any of the main characters. The sadism described in this book was disturbing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is cool because its not just one game, but a bunch of really fun mini games! Its great because there is so much to do!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This is Adam's best work! Love this album so much, he sings like no other! I highly recommend that everyone pick up a copy.  If you are not sure you will like his music, take a listen.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This book began with a questionable character who soon became the hero of the story. Baldacci does it again with his surprise twists and turns that keep the pages turning.<br />Who knew this questionable character would turn out to have a heart.  He acted on his intuition where others in his profession would have been long gone under the circumstances.<br />The story is fast paced, exciting and worth every penny.  But what else is new?  Once a Baldacci fan, always a Baldacci fan.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game. Easy to use with great graphics. Inexpensive for the amount of hours that can be wiled away playing it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game provides hours of entertainment.  I really like adding the many different families to the village.  I've redesigned the village a few times to maximize space and make it more interesting. after playing it for a while now, I can appreciate Scrat's hoarding of acorns!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is worth the buy!!!!! :) It is a cute game to play and also very addicting!!!!<br /><br />  if i  were u i  would buy this app<br /> Amazon should make more apps like this &gt;_&lt;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is pretty fun. but having to sit and wait for the money to catch up to the tasks being given is kinda annoying.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is so cute<br />i highly recommend<br />i love this app<br />very addicting<br />worth the buy<br />and if I were u I would get this app:)
0307592839|5.0|Perfect. I love this book.  Its creativity startled me. It shocked me awake.  After each chapter I had to pause for 10 minutes (that's a long pause) and take it all in, a little at a time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has given me the chance to interact with God through the Bible. I love the way it is organized and has a reading plan that fits for anybody. Awesome app, worth buying.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Easy to use and fun. I have not had trouble moving pieces on the Kindle Fire. plenty of free puzzle packs. Ads are a bit annoying.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to admit that I did not want to read this book at first, then read a sample and had to buy it. It is a very easy read, if your an \\"intellectual\\" and want to overthink things, then this book is not for you. The erotica in it is wonderful. I enjoy reading about those types of things, once again if you are prudish in any way this is not the book for you. It is purely fantasy, and thank God for it, it is nice to be entertained for a change. I am on the second one and fully intend to buy the third book. If you want something that you can just read, escape for a bit, not have to think too much about, and really get hot about then this is the book for you. Enjoy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|leps world is really fun. it is not too hard and not too easy.it is a really fun even for little kids.
B000VE439Y|5.0|This is my favourite movie of all time. The punch lines are endless and tears of laughter will run down your cheeks. Buy it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the kids really enjoyed the movie clip and the kung. fu. scratch game it was really cute and they learned
B004UQ03P2|1.0|First time they shipped it was bended but thanks to amazon incredible costumer service I got it replaced, the second one was in perfect conditions, it was really easy to apply and everything, but when I turned my laptop on, surprise! The image quality looks terrible and I saw that some other costumers noticed that too! Not sure if should return it and try to find another one or just leave my screen without one :/... I just can't believe that several costumers said this was the greatest thing on earth for you MBP's screen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get points by playing games to get more games that are better than before. There are shooting and aiming games. my favorite is darts.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Cool and unique game. Got it free, but would pay for it. Fun trying to figure out, and it's cool that you don't need to solve one puzzle to get to the next one; all puzzles are open and playable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It is a good game for kids of all ages. This game is amazing, and solo much fun!
B007N85POS|4.0|I find this version of Angry Birds challenging and fun.  I prefer it to Angry Birds, Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Space.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I loved this app when I got it. I would play with my friends and family. it was a great app especially for being free! but then I try to open it today and it opens it is black and then closes. So I loved it until I could not play anymore! And I get people asking me why didn't you answer me on draw something. And I have to say well it is not working!!!!!! please fix this app it is very fun until you cann't play anymore.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best app ever! I can't stop playing it! Every time I turn on my KindleFire I see it at the front of my carousel because I played it recently and I just have to play it! It is almost always the first thing in my carousel!!! I would recommend this app for people that like a good and fun challenge.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is so fun.it deserves a 5 stars up.this game is fair, fun, and awsome.it gives u money when u do and don't need it
B0059WTMLW|5.0|6/29/2013 EDIT<br /><br />Today I discovered that this was the free app of the day and I said in my original review below that if they removed Open Feint and the other Analytic data gathering program then I would gladly give it 5 stars.  I am pleased to discover that the developers actually listened to the reviews and removed both of these things from their games.  One thing I do have a concern about tho (but not enough to remove a star) is I had originally gotten this around June 9, 2012 (I think) and when the app showed up today I thought it looked familiar but I hit purchase anyway and it acted like I had never bought this.  I even got the email acknowledging my download.  That concerns me because that means when I removed the game from my Kindle Fire HD 7\\" somehow it got deleted from my cloud and if I have to uninstall this one and it, too, disappears because it wasn't \\"paid\\" for then I'm coming back to remove 2 stars because that's just not right.  I hope no one else has had this problem and it is only me.  We pay Amazon in order to be Prime members to get a free app a day and to have it removed because I got it as a free app when I uninstalled it is appalling.  However, I don't know that's a fact - maybe, somehow, some way, it got accidentally removed.  But I sure hope that's the case because a company that won't allow one of their apps they allow to be the FAOTD to be uninstalled and then not be found when you want to reinstall it only to find out you have to pay is a company I don't want to do business with.  But I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt unless it happens again when I have to uninstall for any reason.<br /><br />Otherwise, I still agree with what I wrote below.<br /><br />======================================================<br /><br />I agree with the one reviewer who stated that the difficulty of the puzzles were a bit higher than what they are stated but once you get the hang of it they are about right.<br /><br />What I'm not too fond of however is the fact when you're working on a puzzle (say 1 for instance) and you have to pause, when you return to it suddenly you're on (or what appears to be) puzzle 2. Now I may be wrong and it's just showing how many times you went back to it but I don't think so because when I finished it I was all if a sudden on #7 when I finally was able to go back and complete the 1st puzzle. That may not make a difference but when you can't go and pick a puzzle it makes you wonder what puzzles you've missed.<br /><br />Also what I'd like to see is a button to reset the puzzle without using the undo button (which may be there and I missed it?). If those issues are addressed (plus that other whatever it's called that \\"gathers anonymous data\\" crap\\" - give us the option up front to disable it like you do with open feint or at least tell us it's there in your description) then I'd gladly give it 5 stars. Until then only 4 (would have been 3.5 but it wouldn't let me and it's better than a 3).however is the fact when you're working on a puzzle (say 1 for instance) and you have to pause, when you return to it suddenly you're on (or what appears to be) puzzle 2.

0345803485|1.0|I gave up after a few chapters. Listening to Anna read her emails from Christian, always listing the time and date. Along with his official title, over and over. I just couldn't take it.<br />Don't waste your time on the book. Annoying as hell.

1469984202|3.0|Hugh Howey has a great story concept with his silos, and I had no trouble suspending disbelief. [Spoiler Alert Here] Some reviewers thought it unbelievable that there were no elevators, that the Mayor's poisoning wasn't investigated, and that those who were exiled were sent to clean the camera lens. This is a controlled society where the villain doesn't want people moving around with ease or communicating easily with each other (thus no elevators), and the villain--who is a powerful person--doesn't want an investigation into the Mayor's death (when Sheriff Jules gets suspicious, she is sent to \\"cleaning\\"), and the \\"cleaning\\" is just a ritual--even when a citizen is exiled, the villain controls the show to that last moment.<br /><br />[End Spoiler Alert] Although the first three parts were highly readable, the fourth was less so, and the fifth (and longest) dragged in places. Howey didn't remember this quote from Elmore Leonard: \\"I try to leave out the parts that readers skip.\\" I found myself skimming large chunks of part 5 because they were mostly transition descriptions and didn't move the story forward. He probably could cut 25% of part five and have a much better story.<br /><br />And finally, the series itself was uneven. There isn't one hero or heroine to tie all five parts together. Jules comes closest, but she doesn't make an appearance until the end of part 2, and then she is a minor character. She doesn't become the main character until parts 3-5. The series is forced. I think writing one long novel, beginning with Jules and using a tiny bit of parts 1 and 2 as backstory, would make it a more compelling story.<br /><br />But I'll give the series 3 stars because I was enjoying it until it really bogged down in part 5.
0446572993|3.0|I have been a fan of DB and have found his body of work as a whole really entertaining.  If you have enjoyed his other books, then you will likely enjoy The Innocent and find it worth reading.  It started off well enough with an interesting scenario that hooked me right away and it was full of the action that I have come to expect.  But the introduction of the 14 year old girl and how she came across was sometimes hard to believe.  I thought that as the story progressed past the halfway point it sometimes felt like it bogged down slightly.  Also, for me, as we got closer to running out of pages there was a distinct \\"lurch\\" from the continuing story to the final few chapters that wrapped-up the book.  It was as if the deadline needed to be met.  In spite of this, both the story and action were good and made up for these criticisms.  All in all, I would have rated the book a 4, but had to round down due to the abrupt transition to wrapping up the details and ending the book.  Still an entertaining read, and I look forward to the next one!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. finnaly an app game I'm not terrible at.It's the new angry birds. I think anyone who gets this game will enjoy it and have hours of fun!
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|but this set won't mesh well with Kingdom's sets.<br /><br />I bought this set from the LEGO website, bundled with The Battle of Helm's Deep (9474). In addition to a free shipping promotion, I received double points, a poster, and a small airplane. This set will make a good display piece in my apartment.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />This set contains one instruction manual that is about 75 pages long. The set is split up into two bags. The first bag builds the four Uruk-hai (evil?) soldiers, along with a ballista. The second bag builds the two Rohan (good?) soliders, the horse, and the section of wall. The instruction manual is not attached to cardboard; you will probably want paperweights.<br /><br />MINIFIGURES:<br />All of the Uruk-hai minifigures have red faces; they will not work well in Kingdom's sets unless you have extra heads or keep their helmets on. Two of the Uruk-hai soldiers have large battleaxes, chest plates, and a new style of helmet. The other two have a shield and a sword (both are new to LEGO), one has the new style helmet, the other has long black hair. They all use the same legs and chest pieces.<br /><br />Both Rohan soldiers have red/orange hair. Both have the same style helmet, one is leafed in gold. One has a bow and arrow, the other has a spear, shield, and dark green cape. The spear looks to be unique to this series, the head of the spear is silver/gray and the shaft is brown. It is all one piece.<br /><br />The horse is brown. A special feature of this horse is that it's back half (legs and tail) is able to pivot, along with its head. This allows the horse to rear up on its hind legs. One thing not apparent (and a nice feature) is that the horse WILL balance on a level surface, even with a minifigure riding it. The horse's saddle comes with a new sword.<br /><br />BALLISTA:<br />The ballista comes with two grapple hooks. It's wheels are actually two round plates stuck together (which is a bit of a disappointment). It has a slider which supposedly shoots the grapple hooks, I haven't had any luck getting them to pop out more than an inch. The hooks are not very well made, don't handle roughly (they will break easily!) Don't expect much distance. The ballista has some nice decoration, which includes three flat plates with wood prints already attached (no stickers!)<br /><br />WALL:<br />The wall's base measures 16x6 dots, and is about 9 blocks high. The wall is highly decorated, with a new *stone* exterior style 1x2 brick. Those aren't plates in the picture. The wall has a slit in the middle so the archer can *fire* arrows throw it, and two \\"windows\\" on the sides. In the center of the wall is a standard catapult, along with three cylinders to fire. This part actually works, a good flick and the cylinder will go 4-5 feet! Not shown on the wall is a set of stairs in back, and enough space for minifigures to stand. At the sides of the wall are connecting pieces, so you can extend your LOTR castle sets.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS:<br />This set has a lot of decoration, has a bunch of minifigures, a new horse, and quite a few play features. It also includes a few new weapons and a few new stone bricks. At a MSRP of 29.99 for 257 pieces, it is a bit pricey, but if you're going to lay siege to Helm's Deep, I'd call it a must.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book started out good and I thought I was really going to enjoy it. Thats why I gave it one star. However I have never hated a main male character more then Travis. His neediness was so annoying. And Abby was just stupid. I think the author is trying to make it like Edward from Twilight the overprotective boyfriend, but it definitely does not work in this book. I have never been disappointed in a happy ending before. The reviews definitely deceive you. I just wanted to finish book so I mostly skimmed the ending to see what happened. I definitely don't recommend this book.
B005HSL626|4.0|I have this game on my ipod touch and it has a update for starfruit (use to get 3 helpful items) and a pomegranate (slice as many times and get that many points) so if u can put that update on fire I will rate 5 stars. also can u put jetpack joyride on kindle fire plz. thanks!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This film is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. The \\"beginning of time\\" montage that starts the film is beautiful; roaming shots of the Icelandic countryside and angry waterfalls wash over you as the score tries to soothe you in a way that feels like it's trying to mislead you. It's as if it's trying to say, \\"There there, it'll be alright,\\" and pats you softly on the hand like a caring grandmother before turning around in the next scene and growing to its peak as something horrific takes place on screen that wasn't expected mere moments ago.<br /><br />Everything is awe-inspiring to look at. One of the reasons for that is that Scott tried to use as little CGI in the film as possible (although there are over 1300 digital VFX shots) and mostly stuck to computer generated shots being used in space. If you're not blown away by the scenery, their exploration of the planet's surface and what that leads to, or the incredible shots in space, the technology they use in the film is beyond astounding; Reacting with holograms, 3D maps that can be accessed with the swipe of a finger, and an android capable of doing things some people only dream of is only scratching the surface.<br /><br />Where do we come from? Who are our makers? Will we still trust our faith when we find the answers? These are the questions \\"Prometheus\\" explores in its story. You also have a pretty great idea of just what the heck a Space Jockey is by the time \\"Prometheus\\" ends. The thing is that if you go into this expecting a straight shooting \\"Alien\\" prequel, you'll more than likely be disappointed. There are definitely nods to it and parts of the film play out similarly to \\"Alien,\\" but this is more like taking place in the same universe as \\"Alien\\" and more of an indirect prequel. That quote Ridley Scott gave about this \\"having 'Alien' DNA,\\" is extremely accurate.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" isn't perfect. It may be really slow moving for some. It takes its sweet time establishing its atmosphere and you may be left wanting a bit more action. Patient viewers who can sit still and admire dialogue and a solid story will be rewarded while trigger happy viewers will more than likely get antsy. The ending, although somewhat satisfying, is mostly just this huge tease. If a sequel isn't made, we should probably riot; although, with repeat viewings, it's less of a problem.<br /><br />The biggest issue people may have is that technology seems so much more advanced in the past than in the future. \\"Prometheus\\" mostly takes place in 2093 while \\"Alien\\" takes place in 2122. You also have to keep in mind that the Prometheus is a more advanced ship than the Nostromo, a towing vessel; more of a grunt ship. So the argument could go either way.<br /><br />Repeat viewings also leave you with more questions. The main one being why did the atmosphere have such an altering affect on the ampule room yet didn't affect the cargo hold at all?<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" is really freaking superb on one hand. Its cast is ridiculous and every one of them delivers, the visuals are fantastic, and the storyline is mostly incredibly enthralling. Imagine being a film critic who's used to taking notes throughout the duration of a film, but during \\"Prometheus\\" you were so absorbed in it that you didn't write anything down other than the title. That's kind of a big deal.<br /><br />On the other hand, something more definitive seems like it would have been more gratifying. With stakes so high that define what we, as humans, actually are, an open ending leaving room for a sequel feels like a bit of a cop out. \\"Prometheus\\" is still spectacular and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott is back in top form, but \\"Prometheus\\" suffers from pulling (and relying on) the strings of anticipation a bit too much.u may be left wanting a bit more action.

B000ICLRIE|1.0|I bought this on a whim ... figuring with Orlando Bloom in the lead and Ridley Scott at the helm that it might be a good movie. Turned out to be one of the worst I've ever seen. It was choppy and difficult to follow. Don't waste your time or money.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Finished this book so quickly. I had to discipline myself to go to sleep at night and get other chores done.
0470503696|5.0|At the time I purchased this book, I had seen a lot of job postings that required \\"Macros\\" or \\"Visual Basic\\" on some level. Tired of being limited by my lack of knowledge, I purchased this book. It clearly explains all of the concepts of programming: Strings, Integers, Arrays, Functions, Modules, etc. If you really take the effort to read the chapters and understand the concepts presented, you will be rewarded with the knowledge of how programming works. Not all of it is easy, I remember having to re-read several chapters, but it was worth it. I strongly recommend this book, as it provides an introduction to all programming, not just VBA.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|its fun but on angry birds Rio it says the new world is out sure as heck don't look like it
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read Hunger Games because the movie was coming out and all the rave reviews about the book.  I thought it was interesting but the writing was a bit generic and predictable.  Catching Fire addresses both those issues and was a great read.  The author took some more time to make you really want to care about the characters by giving them a bit more depth and reacting to situations in a believable manner.  Plus the story got a lot more interesting and a lot more involved.  Several times had to go back a page to make sure that you read the passage correctly because it just was so radical  The only reason I could not rate a full 5 stars is that I thought the last few chapters were a bit rushed and could have been better written with more depth.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|This product is great! Works great, I love the protective cover around the whole cord. So much better then what is in stores, and a lot cheaper too!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I enjoy reading erotica...all types.  So when I heard about this and it's following, I decided to give it a try.  I really wish I hadn't.  To begin, Christian and Ana may be presented as of adults of consenting age, but their interactions were anything but.  They interacted like a couple of emotionally stunted teenagers.  And, don't get me started on Christian's supposed perfection...all at age 26!!  The so-called sex scenes left much to be desired and actually had me saying, \\"Jeez, *I've* written better than this!\\"  Then I found out that it had originally started out as Twilight fanfiction....really?  That made it even more appalling.  I'm not really that picky and I usually like every thing I read, but I hated this.  So, for me to hate something...it's got to be bad.  Since I have to rate this, I give it 1 star....but if I could give it a negative million, I would...I disliked it that much.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Don't waste your time.  Or money.  There's way better out there.

0131480057|5.0|I recently graduated from my local college with an associates in Linux System Administration. To be honest, I did forget quite a few stuff I have learned over the last two years like setting up a samba server or doing remote backups since I really didn't have the means at home to review, study, and drill into my head all of that stuff over and over again. Thats where this awesome book comes in. It has everything a new entry level administrator needs to know. It has over 1,200 pages that covers pratically almost every single topic you can think of. From sshing, kernel drivers, software installation, basic tcp/ip networking, DNS, to setting up a mail server. It even covers basic Cisco router configuration. This book has it all. And to top it off, not only does it cover Linux and a few distros like Redhat EL and Suse, it also covers Solaris and HP HP-UX.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any new gradurate or anyone interested in becoming an administrator. This book is a life saver.
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|I am a professional videographer and I purchased this device too see if it could be a cheaper alternative to the Merlin steadicam. I am certified with a Steadicam Pilot, but never used anything like this before. I was actually surprised how the rules and set up that apply to the higher end steadicam units also apply to this device. It is way more basic then the Pilot, but when you get it right the device will work with you and less against you. Because of the my experience and training with the Pilot, I would highly recommend taking a workshop or talking to someone in the industry about using steadicam devices. It took me about 15 to 20 minutes to balance the unit and start flying it with my DSLR, but that is also cause I knew what to look for. If you have no experience your results may be unpleasant and you may never know where to start. So far after one day of use, I am still not sure how am going to like the device, but It show promise so far.....Reason why I didn't give it 5 Stars.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert's \\"Trespassing\\" surpasses all expectations and is truly a great album!  I've listened to the entire album on repeat and never tire of listening.  Every song is a gem, and I discover something new, whether it's a particular phrasing of a lyric or a nuanced tone, every time I listen.  There's not a filler in the group including the bonus tracks.  I'd definitely get the deluxe version to have those 3 bonus tracks.  I love hearing all the different influences from funk, r&b, rock and pop put together with a very current sound, but what I love most of all about this album is Adam's voice front and center.  And what an amazing, soulful voice he has!  The first half of the album has songs that get you movin' and groovin' and the other half has songs that can't help but move you in another way.. illustrating the light and dark aspects of being human.  I can't recommend this album highly enough.. love it!!

B0059WTMLW|2.0|While yes it does have Open Feint, it givea you the option to enable or disable it right away. However, in an attempt to refuse to understand why people would not want OpenFeint in the first place, it also enables something call Flurry Analytics by default. It claims this feature collects anonymous data about your usage of the game, but considering there's no reason a Sudoku game would ever nees that it's very suspicious.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|It's a diverting summer movie! It's SciFi, but I wouldn't go so far as to deem it science fiction, if you understand the difference.<br /><br />While the movie has it's flaws it's not too bad. It tries to be a few too many things and I think it would have been more successful if they'd dropped the whole creature feature bit. Why not just an alien archaeology adventure film? That's enough to chew on, really. Didn't get the two zombie crew members who seem to be throw in as an after thought for a couple of unnecessary scares.<br /><br />Best 3D I've seen yet. So if you're going to the cinema, fork over the extra shillings for the opportunity to wear plastic eyeglasses.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|\\"Prometheus\\" engineers/humanoid aliens and their spacecraft, alien planet landscapes synchronized to the original \\"Alien\\" film  in plot and special effects! That was the pros and the following are the cons...<br />I was confused with the finale related to the \\"Alien\\" franchise of the mutated predecessor of the \\"bipedal, back pipes\\" alien bursting from the \\"engineer/humanoid's\\" chest origins! The 2092 A.D. era date of \\"Prometheus\\" contradict the early 21st century era date of the \\"AVP or Alien vs. Predator\\" franchise in which the \\"bipedal, back pipes\\" aliens already existed in the human/Earth present and there ancient history! \\"Prometheus\\" was a 3 out of 5 stars movie rating to me because of the era dates contradiction of the \\"bipedal, back pipes\\" alien's origin (no historical background continuity) between all the varied film's franchise!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|If asked what my favorite \\"type\\" of movie is, I'm apt to respond science fiction.  Yet the genre is a relatively small percentage of my film collection.  The fact is that they are rarely done well.  Having said that, a few rank high on my favorites list.  Two were directed by Ridley Scott (\\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\").  Scott's \\"Prometheus\\" will join that list.  It is no secret at this point, but this film is a prequel of sorts to \\"Alien.\\"  Not that there is a direct linkage, but as Scott says there's common DNA.  Indeed human DNA is a source for this story.<br /><br />Numerous discovered cave art from across Earth have been analyzed to suggest a common cluster of stars and perhaps the origin of human life.  Two prominent scientists, who happened to also be romantically attached, are hired by Wayland Corp. (also from \\"Alien\\") to travel to a distant moon to investigate the possibility.  Wayland's representative on the trip is a stone-faced Meredith Vickers played by Charlize Theron, reenacting a similar sinister character from the recent \\"Snow White and the Huntsman.\\"  As in all the \\"Alien\\" films the corporate representatives are never there to help.<br /><br />Other key characters include scientist Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) a true evolutionist and God-fearing girlfriend scientist, Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace (\\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\") in another memorable performance.  The other performance to watch is the amazing Michael Fassbender (\\"Haywire\\") as the android called David.  In an early scene check out how David acquires his \\"personality.\\"  He emulates blond Peter O'Toole from his favorite movie, \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\"<br /><br />Ridley Scott's return to the franchise allows him to follow-up on the neglected sequence when the \\"Space Jockey\\" is found in the original film.  Who was he?  What was he after?  How did he die?  Where did he come from?  Some questions are answered.  Some will have to wait for a probable sequel and before we get the direct connection to \\"Alien.\\"  Scott, who always seems to direct films with strong female leads, makes no exception here.  Rapace's Dr. Shaw is no shrinking violet and takes the most courageous actions of the ship's crew, aided by Captain Janek (Idris Elba).  She even undergoes a self-directed but machine automated surgical procedure which will get you squirming in your seat.<br /><br />There are some ever engulfing scenes of the ship (Prometheus), the vastness of space and the confines of caves that are in a word, magnificent.  I saw this movie in 3-D and it looks great.  There are few, if any, in-your-face effects but the overall quality of the camera work is excellent.  The 3-D adds depth to many of the shots and doesn't darken the picture.  Ultimately, the film doesn't answer all the questions, but gives us enough to conjure plenty of ideas.  More please.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (10-11-12):  I wasn't surprised to find this Blu ray transfer to be near perfect.  Since I don't have 3-D at home yet I opted for the Blu ray/DVD/Digital copy version.  The video is in 1080p as you would expect and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio nearly identical to the original theatrical release.  Lighting is a major factor in the film.  It is dark (takes place in space) so director Scott and his crew had to manage cameras and lighting to get the proper intensity.  The transfer looks beautiful. Stunning.  Gorgeous. Spectacular.  Detail is excellent.<br /><br />The audio is likewise perfect.  The prime track to sample is the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1.  If you have a properly set up rig, this soundtrack will knock your socks off.  The subs and woofers will get a workout, but none of the small sounds are missed either.  The great orchestral score washes over the entire picture.  Optional audio includes Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks with Enlish descriptive, Spanish, and French.<br /><br />There are plenty of interesting special features as well.  Audio commentaries are provided by director/producer Ridley Scott and another by writer John Spaihts and writer/executive producer Damon Lindelof.  There are 14 deleted/extended/alternate scenes that total about 37 minutes.  Finally there is a segment called \\"The Peter Weyland Files.\\" This consists of some video files reflecting some insider info on the fictious Weyland Corp.

That is why I liked the movie; it really gave us many ways to see how societies collapsed, are collasping, or will collapse. Also, I enjoyed they gave us historical evidence to support their facts. It gave us a learning experience of history and today present day. I really enjoyed this movie.

B003Y5USF0|2.0|I hate to rain on everyone's tornado here, but to me--the special effects of \\"Twister\\", however formidable, are undone by a juvenile script and characters who range from smug (Paxton, Hunt) to shrill (the incessantly whacky band of storm chasers). Ironically, the only character that came close to being \\"sympathetic\\" for me was the one I was supposed to hate--Jami Gertz (as Paxton's square fianc&eacute;). Never mind that she is supposed to be Mrs. Wrong--uptight, unadventurous, etc. Her intelligent portrayal of a not-so-intelligent woman gives the film its only honest laughs as well as its only pathos, and I'll take her any day over Hell-Yeah Helen and Damn-Straight Bill, or their band of sycophantic cheerleaders who practically shake pom-poms and do victory splits every time either character speaks.<br /><br />Their Greek Chorus-like function, I suppose, is to remind us who we're rooting for, but personally it turns me off to be dictated to quite so transparently. Don't TELL me who to like--MAKE the characters likable and I'll like them, okay? The whole rowdy ensemble is thrust with such gusto down our throats, one hates them on principle alone.<br /><br />That bitch-fest aside, the twisters are obviously the main attraction here, and they produce a few powerful moments. Take the atmospheric opening scene-in which the cyclone is personified as a malevolent predator, like an evil Santa Claus who instead of leaving gifts, comes to rob you of that which you love. The idea of the twister as a character is  especially effective, but the film makers never really carry that through, and so the film misses its chance to be poetic. However, spectacle is the compensation, and  in much the same way as the sinking ship was the payoff in \\"Titanic\\", the whirling dirt funnels--whether they are characters or just random vacuums-- are still exciting and are the real stars of \\"Twister\\". And as long as they're wrecking lots of havoc,  the movie cannot be totally sunk by it's cast, script, or even the misguided direction that constantly threatens to pull them all into its suck zone.r even the misguided direction that constantly threatens to pull them all into its suck zone.

The dedication that she had for teaching her children and making sure they had  the best life possible is admirable. Amy has a very easy to read writing style. She mixed in wisdom and humor in the narrative and I found myself alternating between laughing and crying while reading. The end of the book when it appears that she has softened her approach was very moving. I feel like I know her and her daughters after reading the book and strangely feel like following their lives from now on.

0393088774|5.0|Maybe because Paul Krugman is used to writing for a general audience through his gig as a New York Times writer and blogger. This book is consistent with his style, clearly written and generally accessible to the lay audience. I first found out about this book after watching CNN and Krugman had just given an interview. I am not an economist but certainly someone with a deep interest in this subject and who has read widely in this field.  I had my doubts about Krugman at first.  His ideas seem counter-intuitive in an era when everyone is calling for austerity from preeminent economists to policymakers. After all, it was because of reckless borrowing and spending that the American economy is in such dire straits today. The only way, at least for politicians playing upon people's fears, is then to rein in the spending. For these particular politicians, their economic policies are driven more by political ideology - to minimize the role of government intervention - than by economic facts. Paul Krugman neatly dispels the argument of these austerity-seeking policymakers. He emphasizes at various points in the book that economics is not a morality play but what Austerians look for is exactly that. What most people in the Austerian camp fail to realize is that we are not in normal times, a point perfectly captured by Krugman's proposal, which is only meant to be a short-term solution, to pull out all the stops get employment back on track. The American economy is in a liquidity trap; the interest rate is near zero but there is no increase in investment or spending. This isn't a garden variety recession, but a Great Recession fueled by one bubble after another (stock market followed by housing). To fight such recession, Krugman proposes that the government must engage in non-conventional economic policies. The fact that Krugman believes in a strong federal government role will not sit well with people who are strict Austerians but I believe that Austerians should put aside their politically motivated arguments for one moment and read Krugman's policy prescription. Krugman's analysis is fairly balanced with economic arguments for both sides. At another point in history, the Austerians are correct about balancing the budget. However, economics is never as simple as a science experiment. There are just too many uncontrolled variables involved at any given moment. Even when a country engages in austerity (and he used the example of Canada), economic expansion is not possible without other variables such as strong exports and low interest rates.  What Krugman implies is that those calling on the government to slash spending are rather simplistic in their economic analysis. Economic is never black and white. A simple economic analysis propelled by a political ideology is particularly damaging in these uncertain times. This is an important book.

0525423656|3.0|Before I start on Crossed, a little bit of background on my thoughts on Matched, the first book in this trilogy. I read a lot of mixed reviews for Matched, and things that other reviewers disliked about it were things that I actually relished and enjoyed about the story.  Condie's writing of this dystopian world is slow paced and has a mysterious undercurrent of wrongness about the society that just builds your anticipation as to how its all going to play out.  I also quite liked Cassia and could understand her reasons and motivations through the storyline overall I thought it was a very solid book and was really interested to see what happened in the sequel.<br /><br />Crossed starts out in a very different place.  Ky has been sent to the outer provinces and Cassia is determined to find him.  I was really looking forward to their journey to one another yet the way they were brought together was just unrealistic and implausible to say the least. Cassia manages to by complete fluke hop on an airship that magically takes her to the area that Ky was sent to.  And then manages to escape without any planning or difficulties even though Ky only just managed to himself and no one has survived previously??? I just couldn't buy it.<br /><br />The book is written from both Ky and Cassia's perspective as they journey to find one another, which sounds romantic and like it would build your anticipation.  Unfortunately I found it jarring and really felt that it took from the overall story instead of adding to it.  Amongst the unrealistic plot is a lot of poetry and prose which I thought was quite heavy handed and instead of me feeling the love between these two, I just got irritated by it and found myself skimming over those parts. Seriously I know teenagers have a lot of angst but considering both Cassia and Ky are written as quite intelligent individuals man do they have real emo tendencies!<br /><br />There are also a couple of new characters introduced into the story who journey with Ky and Cassia respectively and I'm not really sure what their purpose was other to ensure that neither of them when journeying in the middle of the desert alone.  Indie in particular had a lot of promise and I'm hoping that she is explored a bit further in the final novel.<br /><br />Where the first book gave you good insight into the society, Crossed delves more into those opposing the society including the Resistance which is what Cassia and Indie want to join. Finding out about the resistance and the farmers plus some of the back story into the society was what I enjoyed most about this story and I'm very interested to find out how they all play together in the final installment of the trilogy - Reached.<br /><br />Overall I found this an incredibly dissapointing sequel and while I will read the series to conclusion, my expectations aren't particularly high.ney with Ky and Cassia respectively and I'm not really sure what their purpose was other to ensure that neither of them when journeying in the middle of the desert alone.

B0083GPDBO|1.0|I found this to be in the \\"pay me to watch it\\" list. The story line seemed good, and I thought this would be worth watching. I was VERY wrong. I should have waited for it to be on the Prime list, and watched it for free. Even if it takes 10 years to get there, your not missing anything. The movie was choppy (bad editing, not connection speed), several parts were even in the \\"very bad editing\\" catagory. It's hard to tell if ther cast couldn't pull of the characters, or if it was just that badly written. After watching the movie, I understand why the 3 main characters had nose bleeds, it must have been that bad of a head ache to be in this movie. There was verly little to no explanation on the source of their powers, and even less on character back story. This film's best qualities were the special effects, and those were only fair at best.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie to anyone for any reason. Even though I rented this movie, I think a refund should be in order for anyone who has seen it.

B0059WTMLW|5.0|This app does have OpenFeint, but don't panic.  This developer gives you the ability to enable it or leave it totally off--it's your choice.  That's a fair compromise.  (And for those of you who have read some of my other reviews, you know that I hate OpenFeint. I don't have a problem with this developer's approach to handling it this way.)<br /><br />The app does have \\"Flurry Analytics\\"--probably used to track game win/lose ratios; what difficulty levels most users prefer; and maybe even how often this app is played--things like that. However, note that this \\"feature\\" is turned ON by default.  If that bothers you (as it did me a little), just turn off your internet connection before playing for the first time, go into settings, and uncheck it.  There, you're all set--a nice game, but more importantly, a secure game (i.e. no more spyware).<br /><br />There's tons of options (in settings) to customize the look-and-feel of the game pretty much anyway you want.  And this app has been programmed with over 40 Hint Solving Techniques, which you can toggle on and off (you want lots of help--you got it, you want no help--you got it).  It's got undo's and redo's--what more could you ask?<br /><br />As far as the game play goes....  I'm rather new to Sudoku and of all the Sudoku apps I have tried, I have to say this one impressed me the most.  It has 8 different types of games and 8 (yes, 8) levels of difficulty (from Very Easy to Nightmare)--the description does include this information, but I was so impressed by it I had to include it in my review.  The interface is clean and sharp--easy to use.  There's even a way to include multiple numbers in one cell for those moments when it seems more then one selection would work while on the way to working out the true solution.<br /><br />I have to say that I think every Sudoku player would enjoy this app--from the beginner (like me) to the advanced hardcore player.  Really, with all the options, different types of games, and levels of difficulty, it's hard to go wrong with this one.

The musicianship is excellent as are the songs.<br /><br />Hightlights include: A Life Within A Day, Tall Ships (wow - very Zep like almost), Perfect Love Song, Divided Self, Aliens, Sea of Smiles, The Summer Backwards (like a time machine this one) and Storm Chaser (this one rocks).<br /><br />Hints of Yes, Genesis and other flavors of hard/prog rock. Worth repeated listens. A good purchase.

B007RKPO84|5.0|If there is a place that rivals the Bay Area for the birthplace of thrash bands, that would be Essen, Germany, home to the Teutonic triumvirate of thrash metal - Destruction, Sodom and the awesome Kreator.  It seems in the past few years an interesting phenomenon has been occurring as one generation of thrash has been invaded by second generation outfits.  The old guard, the Big 4, Exodus, Forbidden, Testament, Overkill, Kreator, Sodom, Destruction and other great vets of thrash are seeing their students rising in popularity and instead of backing down and letting the new kids carry the torch, some of the first generation bands are saying \\"Not so fast!\\"  Evile, Warbringer and Havok spearhead the new thrash movement and all are great bands, but they are finding that bands like Overkill, with their devastating new CD \\"The Electric Age\\", everything Exodus has done since \\"Tempo Of The Damned\\" and Kreator are making some of the most brutal thrash metal in the world right now.<br />  \\"Phantom Antichrist\\" is a continuation of sorts of the '00' decade of Kreator.  After some missteps, even though in this reviewer's opinion were not bad albums at all, Kreator found their footing with the classic \\"Violent Revolution\\" that was a return to brutal thrash and a musicality that was only hinted at in earlier releases, the most obvious being \\"Coma Of Souls\\", which would serve as a bridge between old Slayer-influence Kreator and the newer style.  \\"Enemy Of God\\" further ensconced Kreator as a thrash legend, including a personal fave \\"Suicide Terrorist\\", and \\"Hordes Of Chaos\\" could have been what is usually a trilogy of great albums in metal circles.  Not this time:  Kreator have upped the ante again with \\"Phantom Antichrist\\", a killer album that easily could be a counterpart to \\"Hordes Of Chaos\\".  The current line-up is rock solid, and the underrated skin basher Ventor shows off his usual \\"Dave Lombardo ain't any better than this\\" chops.  And as good as Lombardo is, Ventor is right.  He could step in for Dave any time.  Mille Petrozza is his usual expressive caustic self, political, smart and growing as a songwriter.  If there is a difference with this new album, it's a few more acoustic passages like the opening intro, and some rhythm variety that helps the album breathe.  Dynamics are more than a constant blast beat, and Petrozza is utilizing this fact more this time around, but with no less intensity or heaviness.<br />  Other bands like Sodom, who also released a barn burner with \\"War and Pieces\\" have had the bar raised again, and if they respond properly, German thrash will be stronger and tougher than ever.  Out of the Big 4, who are becoming more lame with every passing day, it would seem, only Slayer dares compete with the intensity and strength of Kreator.  Petrozza is leaving no room for mistakes.He could step in for Dave any time.  Mille Petrozza is his usual expressive caustic self, political, smart and growing as a songwriter.

0670023329|5.0|There are so many parts of this book that boggle the mind -  the cruelty, atrocities, government brainwashing and mass starvation that we in the modern world would just as soon not acknowledge as existing.  Truly, a lot of readers would prefer the details and story of this young man be safely tucked back in some lost decade fifty or sixty years ago, but it's today, right now.<br />  \\"Escape From Camp 14\\" is the true odyssey of Shin, a boy born into a prison camp and destined to be perennial slave labor in atonement for the sins of his uncle, who had done something to anger the government.  The torment is astonishing, and one doesn't really think of the psychological consequences of such an existence until we read about it first hand and discover just how bad it can be.<br />  The completeness of government control is also jaw dropping.  Kim Jung Il created a state of total media control, so much so only the very elite and most trusted individuals were ever allowed to even sneak a peek at the outside world and see what a different place it was.  Culture shock was something Shin would suffer upon his escape and introduction to other countries, China, South Korea and eventually the United States.  His perceptions of acceptable behavior, which meant being a good snitch and trust absolutely nobody, and being convinced of his unworthiness as a person after classes were conducted every day to drive that point home to all camp residents, would be radically upset upon entering better societies.  Even communist China was a veritable Shangri-La, where food was plentiful, most folks had radios or televisions, and actually made enough money to live somewhat comfortably.<br />  This book is too gruesome to get into much detail here, but it belongs in every high school classroom and adults as well should read this and another fine book, \\"Nothing To Envy\\" by Barbara Demick, which chronicles everyday life in North Korea during a terrible famine in the mid-1990's.  Those who think they understand the privilege of freedom will find out that this concept and lifestyle all Americans take for granted is indeed precious and could be taken away should we ever become so careless to try to not allow it for all citizens, and not just those we happen to agree with.<br />  There are disturbing parallels between the North Koreans' fanatical unwavering support of their regime and those in America who allow politicians and radical factions of Christianity run their lives and do all the \\"thinking\\" for them.  What makes it worse is that Americans are surrendering their free will by choice.  This is a grave mistake, and perhaps viewing life where free will does not exist and is an incomprehensible concept for 23 million people will open minds even just a little bit.  \\"Escape From Camp 14\\" should be a literary monster and belongs in every responsible person's library.ey understand the privilege of freedom will find out that this concept and lifestyle all Americans take for granted is indeed precious and could be taken away should we ever become so careless to try to not allow it for all citizens, and not just those we happen to agree with.<br />  There are disturbing parallels between the North Koreans' fanatical unwavering support of their regime and those in America who allow politicians and radical factions of Christianity run their lives and do all the \\"thinking\\" for them.

Firefly is considered one of the greatest sci-fi shows of all time, but it was unfortunately not handled properly by Fox when it was originally aired and it never caught on.<br /><br />The writing is superb.  There is a reason why Joss Whedon is reveered by actors and Hollywood execs as one of the biggest and most creative people working in entertainment today.  I will forever follow Whedon and whatever he decides to do, he can just have my money!
B00846F1YW|5.0|Fantastic graphics.  The best Android hidden object game I have found for my tablet so far.  Each part to the puzzles are very fast paced and the objects are really sometimes very challenging to find.  The only thing I didn't like was you kept having to find alot of the same objects but they hid them in totally different spots.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes hidden object games.  I will be watching for games from this software company as this one is really fun!

0893860220|5.0|This book is a great reminder of some of us have forgotton.  That we are living in a dream of our own creation. While some critics have pointed in their reviews at the \\"dumb\\" questions to Maharaha, they missed the point.  Its showing just how dumb the unpurified CAN be and his answers hightlights that.  This is one of the most profound books I've read to date.  He plants a seed in the mind to question the reality presented as consciouesness as \\"Self.\\"  If your looking for a book with storylines, about what happpened to so and so, etc, this book is NOT for you.  If you are looking for a book that will help you cut out your own storyline, and look deeply within and question, this is a great book.  Thank you Maharaha for sharing yourself with us.  Peace.<br />Justin

All the naysayers who doubt stimulus, should inform themselves by reading this fine book. Naysayers who should know better, e.g. David Brooks, should not attempt economic pronouncements without first reading \\"Ending This Recession Now!\\".

0156034026|2.0|I felt duped by this book.  I thought I'd have more sympathy for the main character but I grew to feel he is shortsighted and selfish.  He threw away a lucrative career and a top notch education, from which could have helped his needy family.  To me it's a story of wasted potential.  We all have ideals and beliefs but we all don't discard everything we've worked for out of some thinly constructed social protest.  Smiling when thousands died on 9/11, the main character seemed more evil than anything else.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|For two days i have lived an incredible journey with Stephen King. I am  not a fan of Mr. King per se. I have read a total of 2 of his books in my life the first being The Stand (which for me was the greatest book ever written) and now 11/22/63. If you want to be amazed taken on a fantastic ride.READ THIS BOOK!!!!!. Thank You Mr. King for two days I have so enjoyed the journey I have been on. Just knowing that when sleep overcame me I could wake up and once again join Jake on his wonderful travel though time made me arise ready to read as soon as the sun came out. Iloved this book I really hope you do too. Jeni
B007MDB71O|4.0|I sure do hope that the DVD sales of John Carter make up for the bomb that the movie was in theaters. Because at this point I think any studio would be hard pressed to risk another big budget to bring a sequel to the big screen, and that's a shame really. John Carter was an excellent movie that for whatever reason didn't get a fair shake with critics.<br /><br />John Carter is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' \\"Barsoom Series\\",  and the John Carter story was only the first in a series of 11 novels (circa 1917 - 1960something).  So there is/was plenty of sequel potential. But as I mentioned above, I won't be holding my breath for any sequels.<br /><br />Perhaps in addition to the odd slew of negative reception by critics, John Carter also suffered from bad marketing by Disney. I remember seeing the trailers for the movie and not being too impressed. It looked weird and unbelievable; some dude fighting monsters on Mars in prehistoric garb with spaceships flying around. And that's not too far off the mark, but the movie's a lot better than that description makes it sound.<br /><br />In a nutshell, in the late 1800s, John Carter is a Civil War vet that the army wants back in its ranks. While running from the army, he also runs into some hostile Indians and gets chased into a cave where coincidentally some portal or gate is being used by an \\"alien\\" life form. And Carter inadvertently gets sucked into the gate and lands on Mars where the new war that he'll be involved in is anything but civil. I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that the idea was not that Carter gets transferred to Mars as we know it, but Mars in an alternate universe, because John Carter's Mars is fully capable of sustaining human (and non-human) life.<br /><br />The movie has a great story, plenty of action, terrific CGI and it's decently acted. While it ran a little long at just over 2 hours, I was completely entertained from start to finish. And I was left hoping for more. And indeed John Carter was intended to be the first in a trilogy. But according to Entertainment Weekly, Disney expects to lose up to $200MM on John Carter and those kinds of negative numbers won't have Mickey Mouse green-lighting any sequels.<br /><br />But see John Carter. It stands alone as a great film, and while it may leave you wanting more, the open ending can be satisfied with the viewer's own imagination.ntended to be the first in a trilogy.

0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved these 3 books! There was such an intense plot that I couldn't put the books down and got all 3 read in under 2 weeks. Christian Grey, the main male character will definitely have women drooling over him when reading this book!  After I read the 1st book I had to go straight to the 2nd one to find out what happened. The \\"love\\" scenes to me are what I would consider \\"soft core porn\\". I didn't think they were as dirty as some describe them to be. I definitely got into the books caring more about the characters than the sexual content. I highly recommend these books! Several of my friends have also read them and love them as well. Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Turned off WIFI and data before opening app and disabled unwanted connections before playing. Can customize everything. Very responsive and large enough for readable pencil marks on my SG2. Makes playing Sudoku on my phone fun, rather than an aggravation. This is the best Sudoku app I have played so far.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|I saw CRB last December on their tour of the Pacific Northwest.  An absolutely brilliant show and really great fun.  I have been eagerly awaiting this release since that show and went out on the day of its release to buy it.  What a brilliant album this is too.  The jams are long and thick as the smoke they were conceived out of.  This feels like the album Chris has wanted to make for a long time.  Finally he has assembled the right cast to put it all together.  These jams are 70's era Grateful Dead, Allman's and even a dash of Marshall Tucker Band thrown into the melting pot of Robinson's southern funk and West Coast mary jane inspired rock and roll.  Very, very good indeed.  Anybody who loves 72-77 era Dead or the Allman's will really love this album.  It's not all a nod to Chris' musical influences and heroes.  It still sounds fresh and new and very inspired.  But then again, maybe this is exactly what's needed at the moment.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I've had the unit for a couple of months now and have had none of the problems that the 1-star reviews mention. Everything works perfectly, and the discrepancy on the charge indicator doesn't bother me, because now I never have to look at it anyway!

B005OCHOZS|5.0|Wonderful read, my favorite on the subject since Born to Run. Great look into the author's upbringing that gave him the mindset and discipline that led to not only completing, but winning and even setting records in so many impossible races. As a vegan and amateur runner myself, I was heartened to see the descriptions of the food Scott eats, much of which is quite ordinary, yet nutritious fare (bean burritos and potatoes on the run, for example). A highly recommended read for anyone interested in running and the limits of human endurance.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Every time I read this book I appreciate it more. A true classic. I recommend to every reader young and old.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is the first book in a while that I read straight through so that makes it a good book to me.  To see the book as just another memoir set in some pretty fantastic scenery as a couple of people have suggested is missing the point.  The trail itself is not just the setting, it is really a character in the book.  For me, it is the relationship between Cheryl and the trail that make the book so good.<br /><br />After you've read the book, you might enjoy going to Oprah's website and viewing some of the photos of Cheryl and her mother that are posted there.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I just saw the film about 3 hours ago. I was some what disapointed in the film. It started off slow and then about the last 30 minutes it was good.

B005J32Y6Q|4.0|This dance show has a storyline that will occasionally have you going, \\"What the -- ?\\"  If you go in hoping for Riverdance Part 2, well, you kinda get that but under unusual circumstances.  Apparently, the Lord of the Dance (Michael Flatley, who even wears a belt that says he is) is out to conquer the evil forces that descend upon Planet Ireland.  No, don't ask.<br /><br />The evil is represented by a masked leader ans his dozen soldiers dressed in something between Rollerball outfits and riot gear uniforms.  They may try to appear terrifying, but it is hard to fear these stormtroopers when they do an Irish jig.  Often when they are on stage, the background projection shows a devil's head or a death skull.  It is a bizarre show concept for family viewing.<br /><br />I am not saying the show is not without its entertainment.  Michael Flatley is past his prime, but he is still an exceptional dancer.  That is, when he isn't trying to milk applause from the audience.  The rest of the cast are very good, including almost  twenty attractive female dancers who look exceptionally sexy in 3D.<br /><br />(By the way, if you are a guy whose girlfriend is making you watch this video, practice now to keep a non-excited look when you get to 33:47; otherwise, you will suddenly sit up and cry out, \\"Yes!! Thank you, Michael Flatley!!\\")<br /><br />The 3D runs the gamut from very good to extraordinary (at one point, you can count the bangles on a jester's hat).  The black areas of the screen never achieve a respectable full darkness, but there is enough good 3D to make up for that.  (This stage show was filmed in high def 3D cameras.)<br /><br />Audio is good, not exceptional.<br /><br />Though the extras are minimal (a \\"making of\\"), I give this extra points because there are four deleted scenes from the film, all in 3D.

B006UAWH2S|4.0|I watched this tonight having heard nothing about it before, with just a love for Ewan MacGregor. The movie was very well done, great acting, extremely entertaining. The central relationship was a pretty shallow one built on the stress of a changing, chaotic world. There wasn't much depth there. That said it was a fun story with some new twists. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.

B0059WTMLW|5.0|Update: This app has just been updated and it no longer contains Flurry Analytics and OpenFeint.  With the removal of these two items I have raised my review from the original 3 stars to 5 stars.  I played multiple games this morning and this game is probably the best performing Sudoku apps I have played.  Thanks to the developers for listening to the reviewers and improving the product.<br /><br />I love Sudoku and this will become one of my favorite time killing apps to play.<br />++++++++++++++++++<br />my original title:<br />I love Sudoku but not the spyware apps in this program, make sure you turn them off before you play the game!<br /><br />I was excited to see this app this morning as I love Sudoku and play it almost every day. After I downloaded this app I immediately turned it on only to be hit up right off the bat with OpenFeint. Thankfully it let me opt out of OpenFeint but I then looked at the settings and found Flurry Analytics. Flurry Analytics is software that can data mine your use of the app and forward the data to the developer. I have listed its functionality below for you to see. Fortunately the options let you opt out of sending data to the developer but I just wish they would have been more up front with it and given you a chance to opt out of sending data before you began playing the game. Do we have to check every app for every intrusive bit of data collection before we play it?<br /><br />I still gave the game 3 stars as I love playing Sudoku but this could have been a 5 star game if they had told us openly about Flurry Analytics and given us a chance to opt out on the first screen we saw.<br /><br />Flurry Analytics functionality per their web site:<br /><br />Usage Statistics<br /><br />Understand how many new vs. active users you have, sessions, average session lengths, your app's frequency of use, how many consumers use each version of your app, retention over time, and even page views, if you'd like to measure your app that way. Cut all of these metrics by various time intervals and by app version.<br /><br />Category Benchmarks<br /><br />Add context and relevance to your own stats. While it's valuable to see how you might increase session lengths with each subsequent app update, it's even more valuable to compare your performance against that of an app category or the market average. Benchmarks are available for frequency of use, session length and retention statistics.<br /><br />Custom Events & Parameters<br /><br />Easily set-up and track user events most relevant to your app such as when a consumer makes a purchase, completes a level or uses a key feature. Additionally add parameters to events, giving you much finer detail. For example, after setting up an event that tracks the number of completed in-app purchases, next add a parameter to track which items are purchased, the level at which they are purchased and how many use sessions it takes to make a purchase.<br /><br />Audience Segmentation<br /><br />Flurry automatically provides demographic, geographic and user interest data about your app audience. This kind of information can be used to plan your next acquisition campaign (since you know the kind of consumers your app best retains), package your audience as a publisher to market to advertisers or gain a better understanding of your audience to develop more targeted features.<br /><br />Custom Segmentation<br /><br />Beyond audience segmentation, Flurry empowers companies to create any custom segment they can imagine. If we can track it, you can turn it into a segment. Powerful examples include segmenting your audience by paying vs. non-paying consumers and creating time-based cohorts.<br /><br />More Power Features<br /><br />Flurry frequently adds advanced features to its service - all for free - ensuring the most comprehensive mobile app analytics platform available.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game reaaly is fantastic for for my Kindle Fire--it has even replaced the time I spent playing sudoku. The puzzles are challenging, and when you think &quot;There's no way I can figure this out,&quot; you end up doing so, little by little.<br /><br />As for the controls, you can zoom by pinching the screen, swipe to move around a zoomed-in board, and arrows on the side to display the numbers when you're zoomed in. You tap a cell once to mark it, again to mark it as a space, and again to clear it. You can also tap and hold cell and mark multiple ones in a column or row. There is an &quot;undo move&quot; feature as well.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|This hugely anticipated film was attended by me and my family that range in age from teens through 70s.  After a very long discussion at lunch, none of us felt we were satisfied and we agreed the story was convoluted and ineptly told.  So many unanswered questions and so many dumb scenes and situations that seemed contrived or exploitive and in no way touched on the very big issues that were hinted at.<br /><br />We're all educated and we love movies of all kinds.  We discussed the hints of pagan and Christian mythology as well as possible source material for the story (such as it was) on screen.  Was it lifted from Ray Bradbury's poem \\"Christus Apollo\\"?  And why does it have an eerie resemblance to a \\"Dr. Who\\" episode that includes a Dr Shaw character, Prometheus and a big element of one of the apparent central themes?<br /><br />That said, Noomi Repace was excellent and so was Michael Fassbender as an android.  The visuals were of course cutting edge as in all of Ridley Scott's films.  But that's not enough for a satisfying movie experience.  This near debacle of a movie does not even come close to ALIEN.  The whole enterprise was either not thought out enough or way over-thought.  Or it was just a quick way to make a buck.  Too bad.  So sad.  It could have been stupendously magnificent.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|The first thing you notice when looking at the reviews is the wide disparity between stars awarded. Whole bunch of 5 stars and a boiling handful of 1 stars with not much in between.Almost as though the 99%ters are the happy many while the one star reviewers are the disgusted 1% occupying Carter Park and peeing on the lawn. In looking at those 1 star reviews, the common thread seems to be people who have read the ERB series of John Carter novels and hold them dear to their hearts. This movie is not for them. It borrows some from the series and takes off from there. Reconciling your inner visions with the Hollywood version of anything can be a jarring experience. \\"It doesn't fit my pictures\\" is a phrase that fits perfectly here. Hopefully, there's a mini-series out there somewhere more true to the source material although I have to imagine it would resemble old episodes of Flash Gordon.<br />As for the movie itself, I liked it! It was epic at times, nicely photographed and the CGI was - well, I would consider it the real star of the movie. I found the plot somewhat predictable but not hackneyed, Taylor K. less annoying than I expected and the princess' eyes very blue. Overall, an enjoyable movie that reached for the sun and came up slightly short. At say, Mars.
B002ZG9800|5.0|Thank you.I enjoyed the movie.Also thanks for a fast delivery.The cover of the video should have been cleaned a little. It had some dryed up food stain on it.But overall I'm was very pleased with how fast the DVD got to me in the mail.Thanks,T.Smith
B007I1Q4W2|1.0|The story is told from the journal of Civil War soldier, Edward Young (Mark Gibson). It includes excessive boring narration. Rather than just let the story unfold, the narrator tells you what you are seeing. It grates on you after the first 30 minutes.<br /><br />After a quick 1865 scene where a single Union soldier is a zombie, the movie jumps to 1871 and there is a minor zombie infestation. Edward had to kill his own wife (Sarah Stunt) and son, the later in an emotionally gripping scene as he holds his zombie son (Christian Martyn) in his arms (facing away) as he reluctantly puts a gun to his son's head... all the while his son is trying to eat his face off. Somehow I didn't feel it.<br /><br />Bits and pieces of the story is told through animation, which unfortunately was far better than the main feature. Edward has tasked himself in taking his son's ashes to a waterfalls, something he had promised him when he was alive. There is an unwritten rule that all promises terminate with any zombie infestation, apparently not known in the 19th century. The story involves his journey to get there and the people/zombies he meets up with along the way.<br /><br />Dee Wallace, the closet thing to an actor in this film gives us a career killer performance as she emotionally explains the origins of the living dead. It was tough to sit through. The film utilizes the sad piano/violin sound track for way too much of the production.<br /><br />Zombie fans should avoid this one. I was confused as I couldn't tell if the film was a bad zombie film or a bad drama with zombies.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Zombie make-up was good where it was applied, exposed necks are optional.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILER*** The film attempts to come across as a prequel for zombie films. It does a very poor job. It tells you zombies were created using African spells. But at the same time refutes that idea by making it seem zombies are caused by a virus, with one person in the film having natural immunity, and the infection spreading by a saliva/blood contact. You can't have it both ways.ving natural immunity, and the infection spreading by a saliva/blood contact. You can't have it both ways.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|**Spoilers ahead**<br /><br />In one word it was breathtaking. The script, the scenery, the special effects, the costumes all worked together beautifully.  The special effects were especially amazing.<br /><br />I am not generally a Kirsten Stewart fan, but she was amazing in this film and I can't imagine anyone else for the the role. The Snow White character in this version has a strong quietness to her. Locked in the tower she is helpless till she sees birds flying near a large stake, and uses it escape when the Evil queens pervy brother comes to take her to the queen.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is extremely beautiful in this. Her character has a kind of Elizabeth Bathory style to her. As she drains the life young to give her power and magic. Charlize has a way of making you feel sorry for her. Her character has been hurt by love. She believes as society likes to believe, that a woman's power and usefulness is part of her being young and beautiful. When a women grows old and looses her beauty she is worthless and no longer needed. So to prevent this she does all she can. But the older she gets the more souls she needs.<br /><br />The unique thing is its the huntsman that is more important than the prince and he is the one that brings back Snow from her death. The prince, though does truly play his part in saving Snow, seems to take a backseat to the huntsman. I found myself rooting for the huntsman over the prince. But that is one aspect that they leave you hanging on. She doesn't really end up with either.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't like is that dwarves were not played by real little people. There are many amazing little people actors and I would have preferred to have seen the parts go to them. Even though some of my favorite actors were in the roles of the dwarves<br /><br />[...]
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The writers intended this to be an \\"Alien\\" prequel by incorporating \\"Chariots of Gods\\" into the film, although some might question the timeline. They concentrated on creating a special effects film, putting science facts on the back burner. It's basically 60's science fiction with great special effects.<br /><br />Earth has been visited by aliens who created us, and leave a calling card. Instead of traveling to a moon of Jupiter like in 2001, we travel to a distant \\"galactic system\\" to a moon of a planet that looks like Saturn. The year is 2091, the crew is placed in suspended animation for a trip that takes 3 years, nearest star is 4.5 light years away. Sirius is the star frequently indicated as that \\"ancient\\" alien connection. It is 11 light years away. The writers needed to do the math.<br /><br />In this \\"2091: A Space Odyssey\\" tale, HAL is replaced by an android named David (Michael Fassbender) who like HAL has his own orders. When they get to the planet it turns into a special effects sci-fi horror as man tries to find his \\"creator.\\" Noomi  Rapace provides us the only decent human performance in this film. In fact she was so good at one point they called her character, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, \\"Noomi\\" in the film. They are either paying tribute to the famous Carrie Fischer \\"Star Wars\\" blooper, or their film editor is Ed Wood.<br /><br />The dialogue was written in such a way that it lacked entertainment value. It needed to be lighter. The theme of creating life, so that it is not special, bogged down the film. In case you are unaware, the earliest common human language was believed to be a form of \\"click\\" language. I waited for Fassbender to start clicking when he spoke the alien language to show me the extensive research the writers did. It didn't happen.<br /><br />Why is there always some idiot who takes off his helmet to test the air in these films? It's not the oxygen, its the foreign microbes, stupid!<br /><br />Great movie to let the teens go see. Yes, I liked the film, but the writers were a let down. The good news is we can gut part of the voice track and do over the text and make it science fiction presentable without any re-shooting. Heck we might even add a joke or two... \\"These two earthlings, one an android, land on this alien planet and say, \\"Why did you create us?\\"....<br /><br />SPOILER: And if you haven't figured it out from watching 3 movies...the reason why we were created is to generate a species genetically similar to the \\"creators\\" so they could test their biological weapons out on us, i.e. those alien critters.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, 2 people in bed, near sex, no nudity, brief hot chicks. This would easy have been a 5 star movie had the writers did their homework. BTW, I just removed my own appendix, I am going out now to do some dirt biking.ed the film, but the writers were a let down.

B0086700CM|5.0|fun game to pass the time. great graphics! wish there were an actual end to the game. keeps you on your toes!
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I can honestly say this album is one of their better ones. The musicianship, as always, is top notch and this album is one you can really listen to for long periods of time. James is singing some amazing melodies, Jordan is playing very well, John and John are great as ever, and Mike's drumming is out of this world, but his singing...we'll get to that later. John P.'s guitar skill is very well shown off on this album, especially on the 1st and 3rd tracks. He shreds it throughout the album, but he also plays some very passionate, well executed melodies that soar through the songs. Mike's got huge drumming parts in these songs and John M. is there to back him up in keeping the rhythm section tight. All in all, the lineup on this album works.<br /><br />The Music:<br /><br />1. \\"In the Presence of Enemies Part 1\\"- This here is a great start to this album! The opening of it is very guitar and synth driven. It gets progressively heavier and heavier until a little bit of magic happens; they breakdown and John P. takes the slower speed to the next level with an amazing guitar solo that's not full of technical proficiency, but filled with long, flowing notes. This is very nice and is probably one of my favorite parts. It then goes til a silence and then John plays a faster riff that really sounds cool! Then we get into the song and it's very well done! I like this one!<br /><br />2. \\"Forsaken\\"- The vampire subject of this song may seem a little odd and cheesy, but the music DT puts into this song pretty much makes up for that. I like the piano intro and then the guitar riff that comes in after. This song is very good and overall gives this album a nice tone to build upon. Nice song here!<br /><br />3. \\"Constant Motion\\"- Ok, this song is probably one of their best singles (since the singles of Awake). It's also a killer song! I love the drive of this song! It's heavy, it's driving, it's solid, and it's pulled off very well! The guitar work on this one is very good! The drumming is very well executed on this one as well. Mike pulled this one off very nicely. His voice also fits this one. I don't care for his voice on some other DT songs, but I think that his voice makes the song work. Now, if you haven't heard this song, don't worry! James is singing lead; Mike harmonizes and sings a kind of duet with James. I think overall it's pulled off very well. Also the solos on this song are mind-blowing! While it does seem like they are dueling, it works on this song. This one is just a great song and they really blew me away with this one! Nicely done!<br /><br />4. \\"Dark Eternal Night\\"- This one is interesting. I don't mind it, but I don't like it either. The riff is good, but the song itself...this is just one of those songs that Mike should've just kept his mouth shut on. His voice doesn't fit on this one AT ALL! It sounds HORRID! On top of that the instrumental break of this one is just really odd. It has 40's style piano sounds mixed in with the heavy metal vibe? I think this song is just too weird not to mention just bad. There are some good things that come from it, but they don't outweigh the bad.<br /><br />5. \\"Repentance\\"- This song is slower and mellower than the previous ones on the album. It's also somewhat depressing to listen to, but that's the point of it. It's not too bad of a song. However: this song has a long instrumental section with lots of people providing spoken words. It just drags on. If the song stopped at like 4 or 5 min, It'd be fine, but they dragged it out to 10 minutes and it just doesn't work at that length.<br /><br />6. \\"Prophets of War\\"- This song has a unique tone compared to the rest of the songs on this album. I personally like this song. I like the guitar work and the chanting. This one really isn't too impressive as far as DT goes, but I like it. It's a unique song in here and I find it to work. Way to go DT!<br /><br />7. \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\"- My vote for best DT ballad of all time! This song isso good! You look at the length of 14:57 and think \\"oh no. another long song.\\" but even so, this song is GREAT! The melody on this song is simply beautiful! There is a section around the 8 or 9 minute mark where the tempo increases and they do a heavy solo section, but it slows back down for the chorus and instrumental outro after that. I looked at the title and was expecting something heavy, in your face, and similar to \\"Constant Motion\\", but what I got was even better! It's a beautifully crafted ballad and James sounds very passionate on this one! John's guitar work on this one while not impressive in the technical sense is very good! Just the melodies that he plays and the passion he put into his playing makes it just simply amazing! Great song!<br /><br />8. \\"In the Presence of Enemies Part 2\\"- This is the rest of the 1st track on the album. This part is full of amazing guitar licks and drumming stuff, but even so the 1st part is way better. I like this song. I find nothing wrong with it, but if the album would've just ended with the previous track, it would just be better. Part one is very nice and I personally think that Part 2 wasn't necessary. But again nothing is wrong with it, it's still good!<br /><br />Verdict: This is a great Dream Theater album! This one has heavier songs that should impress fans of heavier metal, but also it features some of their best playing since \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Awake\\"! The passion on this album is just inspiring! I think that people who say this album is uninspired should listen to it again because they have a lot of passion in this one! Go buy it now!

0345522478|2.0|I was look for a new Urban Fantasy series that was similar to The Dresden Files and someone recommended this series so I was anxious to read it. I really wanted to like it more then I did and I listened to the audio version because it got such high ratings. For me the book was not bad, ok at best but I never really got into it and the voice for the dog was annoying.<br />I did not feel like there was ever any real suspense in the story for me, whatever fight Atticus gets in he will win and then heal. It seemed to be the same thing over and over. There seemed to be a lot of repeating in this book actually. I understand that he looks 21 but is centuries old (although I think it would have been better if he was a bit older in appearance)<br />This book was funny? I did not laugh at the book at all and found myself wondering if I missed something somewhere?<br />I might read the next one at some point but I don't know and won't be in a hurry to. I was very let down by this book.

B006OAB3ME|2.0|I was disappointed with Paul's latest. I have liked his more recent albums but it seems to me his voice is failing him and his range may be limited. To me the songs all sounded the same with no variety in tempo or style. Not his best attempt.

B003F3NEBG|4.0|While this version of one my all-time favorite production is beautiful and I have nothing but praise for the quality of this Blu-ray issue, I am most disappointed that all the credits and repeated music between the six episodes is back in, having been removed from the DVD version I've enjoyed for so many years.  While I certainly love and appreciate the music composed, even have the CD of it, to listen to that song so much more every 50 minutes is tedious.  If this complete is no trouble for you, DO purchase the Blu-ray issue!

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Wow, just wow. I hate this. I had this app for a while and was happily enjoying it. But then the app wouldn't work any more. It would just come up as a black screen, which is really stupid and annoying.<br /><br />Then I tried deleting it and re-installing it, which really sucks because I was on a really high level with a girl named Samantha. Once I did that, when I typed my password, it kept saying it was invalid.<br /><br />Do not get this app, it has left me unsatisfied, and will probably do the same to you.
B00845PV16|4.0|We wanted to see this movie at the theater but it wasn't out long enough for us to go.  I heard mix reviews and then we saw the ratings on Amazon were low.  We've learned not to listen to the negative reviews as usually we tend to like the one's most people don't.  I really don't understand why this one is getting such bad reviews.  It has plenty of action, special effects and the same type humor as the first.  It is a sequel so it can't have the same story line as the first. I will admit I did like the first much better but usually sequels aren't as good as the first any way.  The character is still the same and at the end of the first he did say he was 'owning the power' so of course we expected a different story line. We figured it wouldn't pick up exactly where it left off and there is plenty of explanation to fill in the gaps. I just don't think the one's giving negative reviews are really paying attention to the movie.  This is the first time we bought a movie for $12.99 before it was released and we are not disappointed. After all, it would have cost $40-$50 to see this in the theater. If you don't want to risk the $12.99 then wait a few days and rent it. It's worth the rental price for sure.

0345803485|2.0|This book was a playful gift from my husband, who has not read it.  It requires the reader to firmly suspend disbelief and accept it as an explicit erotic fantasy.  If you're looking for skillful characterization, a plot with subtlety, or graceful prose, this is not for you.  However, I was drawn into the tale of sexual obsession and emotional tension between naive-but-catching-on-quickly Ana and darkly intense, damaged, domineering Christian.  I wanted to see things work out for them in the end, with Ana's love salving Christian's wounds; I assume this is how things turn out at the end of the third book (title suggests it).  By the way, I am not a regular reader of erotica or romance novels, and I neither read the Twilight books nor saw the movies.<br /><br />The sex scenes are steamy for sure, but to me they were gratuitous after the first few times, and I started skimming over them to look for what was going on emotionally betweeen the lovers.  After being described as inexperienced to the degree of never having explored her own body, Ana's capacity for repeated tectonic orgasms (with minimal stimulation) became somewhat annoying.  I think bondage is a common fantasy for many women, which may in part explain the popularity of this book.  Although Christian is clearly a sadist, Ana is not a masochist, and there is not too much physical pain inflicted.  I did not see the story as demeaning to women as it was clear that Ana made conscious decisions to participate in every encounter.<br /><br />Making this into three books instead of one volume is just a rip-off.  The lack of editing is glaring, and the resultant errors and redundancies are distracting to the point of fatigue for the reader.  Regarding the sex scenes, I'm of the opinion that \\"less is more\\" when evoking arousal.  A much better tale of passion and obsession is \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" by Audrey Niffenegger.  If you still want to read Fifty Shades of Grey, my recommendation is: borrow, don't buy; andlower your expectations of literary merit.  If you can do those things, you may find it's an absorbing, sexy read.  Just don't leave it around for your teenagers to pick up.

0307346609|1.0|I'm not really sure of the vantage point the author is writing from.  An interview?  Interviews?  Who is \\"he\\" in the book.  The approach and/or writing style is very odd.  I was looking forward to reading this book but was quickly disappointed.  I'm not sure if I'll finish reading it; and I've only read twenty pages.  If the movie is anything like the book, I'm sure I'll pass on the movie too.
B007SGM084|4.0|I am a male and I bought the trilogy to see what all the hoopla was about among the ladies in my life.  Turns out it is a pretty good read, sure, its a little racy but I guess that is what all the excitement is about.  Pretty good story line, makes you wonder what is around the next corner or on the next page.  I would love to see how Hollywood would portray the characters and who they would choose for the lead roles.  Anyway, easy reading, but be aware, it does get a little erotic in spots (lots of spots, actually).
B007U1FEJE|3.0|I think I figured out the reason \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is disappointing. Chalk it up to \\"TEMPO TROUBLE!\\" There isn't a single fast track on the entire album.  I was hoping the title track would get me totally psyched up for the other 11 tracks? But its moderate pace let me down.  Every song that followed seemed to be a 'throw away!'  Brian Wilson is one of the most gifted musicians on this planet and I've purchased some of his recent solo CDs.  But if you enjoy the 5 Beach Boys as much as I do...the tempo should be: \\"FUN, FUN, FUN!\\"  Nobody expects Al, Brian, and Mike to sound like they did in the 1960s, but aside from the few 'summer titles'--the music and vocals are lifeless.  C'mon Brian!  Write us an uptempo tune or two...then bring the rest of the guys back into the studio.  Not only will Capitol sell more copies of the next CD, but Beach Boy fans all over the world will break out in smiles!

B007U1FEJE|5.0|That's Why God Made The Radio ranks right up there as one of The Beach Boys best album efforts in my opinion. I am a fan who has been buying all their albums as long as they've been making them and all of their solo albums too. As a BIG fan I hate to admit that there were a few albums that I wasn't too crazy about. Brian has been getting better and better with his solo career, making old time fans wish for other Beach Boys voices with Brian's new greatness. Now our wish came true with this album. It's even way better than I expected. Most of the song writing and performances on this CD are so great and the tunes so catchy that when I'm not listening to it, it's playing in my head. I might need help (Rhonda can you help me here) getting it out of my CD player. These song are even playing in my head while I'm sleeping. This evening I'm going to listen to something different. Very, very great album but can be addictive.

B000001FZK|5.0|If you are into music, listen to this album. You are cheating yourself if you like different forms of music and don't give this a crack.<br /><br />So why am I here 20 years after hearing this for the first time and writing a review (something I don't do). After listening to this a few hundred times in patches over this time, I started listening yet again about six weeks ago. At the moment, it feels like my favorite album of 2012. Each time I have returned to this, I have discovered something new.<br /><br />I was a Talk Talk fan once a friend gave me The Colour of Spring on vinyl when it first came out. I immediately bought the band's two previous albums and thought, Wow, what a progession. Then came Spirit of Eden and then Laughing Stock. I have always respected bands that evolve, but these guys were ginourmous on this front. I did not \\"get\\" Laughing Stock until one day at a business I owned, I left it running  on cassette all day long (1993, old boom box which reversed to the other side of the cassette when it hit the end of one side), and listened to it probably 16 times in the period of one long work day. This album has surfaced as a favorite every few years ever since.<br /><br />So here I am in 2012 and got into it yet again about six weeks ago. Looking up info on this, I learned alot that made me appreciate the artistic bent of these guys more than ever (you can look that up on your own). I just looked up the lyrics today because the lyrics have never been more than just snatches of comprehension, and wow, was I blown away. If you buy this album, get the lyrics and get a grasp of the unbelievable phrasing that Mark Hollis does on this extraordinary set. Lee Harris's percussion is also unbelievably perfect and subdued. All six tracks are a revelation, but Ascendion Day and New Grass are amazing!

Of course, everyone wants to farm her DNA to produce a super race and the humans want her for their own means.  Celine must save her and find Michael-her mate-to stop this from occurring. if you liked the \\"Underworld\\" trilogy as I did, you will like this movie.  Kate Beckkinsale still looks hot in her leather suit!

B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Salma Hayek plays Frida Kahlo like a very deep, colorful and infinitive painting. As an artist I see now that acting can be just like painting and sculpting and even activate maybe some of the same parts of the brain. This film is a classic work of art, beautiful, deep, passionate, tragic, natural, sad, its in the now, present, in the vortex.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|From a conservative's viewpoint, looking at a movie made by liberals, I must say it's a fantastic piece of work. I loved Ronald Reagan, thought he was a far better president than I expected he'd be, as well as an essentially honest man. But I swear to God, the two things he did that I railed about at the time were the de-regulation of the banks and the airlines, bringing chaos to both industries. He shattered a cardinal rule; if it ain't broke, don't fix it. In my gut I knew how wise it was that no bank was ever allowed to operate out of state lines. Consequently, if a bank failed, it was a situation that could be handled. I knew the day would come when banks, willingly helped by dupes and dopes of both parties in Washington, would become that phrase we now know so well, \\"too big to fail.\\" This documentary takes it all right back to that moment, and then moves forward, explaining so that anyone can understand exactly how the nightmare unfolded, and is still unfolding.<br />Every American needs to see this.<br />Alice Von Kannon

All of his books are so easy to read and having read them all I am now much more familiar with our legal system and in some cases it's corruption. I would fully recommend this and all other Grisham books to anyone twenty years old or older. If I had tree thumbs I would have them all up.

0375701427|2.0|Torture is the word that comes to mind when discribing this book .First off the first hundred pages are about almost nothing ,just saying the same thing over and over and over agian....Then the second part of the story is imagined...Please give me a break Im half way through this book and the main reason im finishing it is becouse I paid $15 bucks for it and cant get a new book till Monday.....I hope it gets better i couldnt get much worse...BOOOOO for this piece of babble......I will give a full review when I finish the book
0345803485|1.0|This is by far the worst book I have ever TRIED to read in my whole entire life.  And by tried, I picked up the book several times, skipped ahead in the book, kept hoping and thinking that maybe, just maybe I would be able to find something intelligent, well written, interesting, worth plodding through to make it worth my while to continue on towards the end.  I gave up.  It was simply futile and an utter and complete waste of time.  I have no idea how it ends.  Quite frankly, I don't even care.<br /><br />I am firmly convinced that the main charachter Ana suffers from brain damage and therefore, shame on Grey for having sexual relations with a woman who is mentally impaired.  Furthermore, I think that I would have been more aroused had Ana been given a doll and told to point out where she had been touched inappropriately.  I hated Ana's character because I simply could not relate to her moronic attempts at navigating even the most basic life skills.  Everything Ana said and did grated on me like heavy grit sandpaper.  She is the most annoying character that I have ever come across.  It makes it very difficult as a reader to want to continue on with a story when you simply cannot make an emotional or intellectual connection with a character.<br /><br />With Grey's character, I was not even remotely turned on by him.  On the contrary, I could not shake a mental image that Grey looked, sounded and behaved like Hannibal Lecter throughout the pages that I did read.  In essence, I was pretty creeped out by him.  He was simply repulsive.<br /><br />The writing was atrocious.  The word choice was clearly indicative of a British author which was another thing that I found infuriating.  If you are going to make your characters American then do your research and actually make them believable.  The dialog was abysmal.  No one talks like this!<br /><br />Please spare yourself the agony.  This book does not live up to the hype.  It was mind numbing and will actually dumb you down.  If you need titillation, I suggest role playing with your real life partner and if you don't have a partner subscribe to Cinemax or IFC and watch their erotica.  Trust me, it would be a much better investment of your time and money and much more fun for everyone involved.

1603427244|5.0|This is a smallish book that is packed with information.  You can easily carry this in your knitting bag without adding much extra weight.  A terrific resource for knitters.  Although I have done a number of the cast ons and bind offs in this book, I usually go with the good old long tail cast on and standard bind off because they are easy, and I don't feel like going to the internet to refresh my memory on other methods.  Now I have them at my fingertips and can start and end my knitting differently.  This book is spiral bound, so it lays flat - very nice feature!  Each method has pictures of the front and back of the fabric, characteristics of each, and what they are good for.  Clear step by step photos and written instructions are very helpful and leave me with no questions.  I highly recommend this book for knitters of any experience level.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Does what I need it to do, no need for an upgrade at this time. We will see what happens
159514188X|5.0|I think the point of this book - that it isn't the person who dies but the one who survives that gets another chance - is so poignant and powerful. It is truly the best reason anyone has to never give up and never let go, to always take chances as if it's your last moment, and take a moment to see what may not be obvious. Anyone who reads this will hopefully find the courage to press on.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Ok, probably like some of you, I have come to take the four and five star ratings of most of the low-priced kindle books with a huge grain of salt.  But this book seriously deserves that rating.  I have no idea why this author is selling his books at this low price point, as I would happily have paid full price for his work.  The character development is as good as any I have ever read.  While on most authors in this price range I would urge the buyer to ignore the ratings as they must have been given by friends and family, or readers with no ability to discern true artistry, with this author I can not state enough that you will enjoy his writing.  To put it simply, I look forward to reading his next work as much as I look forward to reading anything by the current \\"greats\\" in this field.  And I sincerely doubt the next book will be priced like this one.
0345803485|1.0|There is literally too many reasons why this book is awful and it is not because the grotesque sex scenes. It's because it is a poorly written book that lacks plot and original characterization.<br />From what I understand this book was originally a twilight fan fiction and it definitely shows BIG TIME. It should be consider plagiarism to be quite honest.<br />I did not recommend this book to anyone.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is. the best game ever you have to try to its awesome. I'm so happy I got it.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Don't listen to the critics; this is a film worth watching! I did not have high expectations for this film; however, to my surprise it was really good. You will not be disappointed! This movie has it all- action, adventure, romance, drama and humor. The storyline was good and the acting was great. The reason it did so poorly in the theaters was because Disney did a terrible job with the marketing campaign and the film's title. I'm definitely a fan and hope they make a sequel.
0062183591|5.0|At first I thought this book was going to be a rehash of material I had read elsewhere. Books about business, behavioral economics and brain 'stuff' often are compiled from material based on the 'original' idea founding the concept.<br /><br />Not so here. True, some of the early pages aren't new ideas. You can find similar exercises on honesty in \\"Exercises in Ethics\\". But as the book goes deeper, it gets more and more interesting. You may find yourself squirming a little as Ariely explores the relativity of honesty.<br /><br />Atheists can be influenced by religious reminders. And the religious will fudge the rules as readily as the non-believer. How dirty will the act of dishonesty get you? That is a sort of determining factor of whether we jump to the dark side. It's more a perception of self than that of 'right'.<br /><br />Because I am in business, I read books like this primarily for business application. I found a lot of very valuable insight in this book. Properly approached, companies could save billions in losses. Using the principles in sales, someone just might greatly improve their close rate.<br /><br />There is a lot to assimilate. If you give it thought, you'll surely get a return on your investment by reading the book. If you approach the book purely for entertainment, you'll get that too.<br /><br />That makes a book worthy of the paper. It's a keeper for your library.<br /><br />Chris Reich<br />TeachU.com
B007HO392S|2.0|When people use terms such as progressive country and exploring new music they really mean this music is not country.  Carrie is great as always but let's not call it \\"country\\".  Let's put it in the pop category where it belongs.  Lately, when she performs she dresses sexy and has a fan blowing on her.  Yes, you look great but toward what end?  I know it's useless now to try and save country music but can't we try.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Since this trilogy has been all the rage, I had to check it out. I knew very little about it, but wanted to understand all of the pop culture references. I must say that I was pleasantly pleased. The author did a fantastic job sucking me in and leaving me wanting more. Fifty Shades of Grey was a fantastic guilty pleasure read (my favorite kind!).

B007U1FEJE|5.0|Finally got it today...a LOT better than I expected.  Really it's a Brian Wilson cd with the remaining boys backing him up.  Sure, there's a couple of clunkers on here ( The Mike Love Tune) but even those aren't too bad & are listenable....(No Summahamas...).  I find it hard to believe that Mike didn't have more input into this cd.  The really big thing I noticed (and didn't/never noticed it before) was the impact of Carl's vocals in the harmony mix now that he is gone. Also Mike's bass vocals aren't at all present like in the old recordings.  And I'm sure that Dennis could have written a couple of good tunes!<br /><br />This CD is definitely a goodbye from the Beach Boys.  It opens up with an \\"Our Prayer\\" type vocal harmonizing tune...then into their BIG HIT (with a bullet) \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" which is a good cruisin' tune.  Then a few songs about trying to relive the past......reminiscing.....the folly of Reality TV.....let's stay nice & cozy & warm.....a dud from Mike.....another Beach tune from Al .....then Brian takes over again with the best music he's written in years...& considering that he is turning 70 this year.....contemplating his life & the fate of man.....his brother's premature deaths....& how, this is it, kiddies.....the last curtain for the heralded Beach Boys.....sounds like a bummer subject but not the way Brian pulls it off! The Beach Boy optimism is still there. However, he realizes he's come to the end of the road & that's it.....whadda you gonna do?  Except hit that home run with your last at bat!!

B007C3TVEY|4.0|Lynne Ramsay's WE NEED TO TALL ABOUT KEVIN is a very unique film experience, and not just in how unsettling the film is, but because of its deft storytelling, terrific directorial style and a tremendous performace by the great Tilda Swinton. Basically, the film is a disjointed and disorienting narrative about Eva (Swinton), the mother of Kevin (who is seen as a young child and then as a teen played by a mesmerizing Ezra Miller) and her husband (a too-paternal John C. Reilly) and the events that tear them all apart in the most horrific way possible. As the film opens, we see Eva in the middle of a massive tomato festival where tomatoes are being hurled around and bathing each person in the crowd in red. Next we see Eva awaking some years later to more red. Her small dumpy house and car have both been vandalized with red paint. This is a visual motif that continues throughout the film and is used to great advantage that Eva is constantly bathed in red, whether surrounded by or lighted by the color.<br /><br />We go back and forth in time to see Eva with her new husband Franklin, a burly and jocular man throughout. They're happy in each other and in their wealth, and then they have their first child Kevin. We see a moment just after the delivery when Francis is cradling and cuddling the newborn, and Eva sits there motionless and expressionless. This is a key moment in the film of things to come between what ultimately dominates the story, which is that of the relationship between Eva and Kevin. As a baby, she seems to resent his presence. As he grows, she seems to resent him more and grow increasingly frustrated with him, and there is a moment of shocking physical abuse, which while being partially an accident, remains abuse nonetheless, but Kevin lies to hide his mother's culpability in this. These moments are interspersed with more glimpses of the future to come of tears and pain, and also Eva's present, which is seeing her older and obviously much more worn down by life. She is also a pariah. In an early scene, she is assaulted in broad daylight by another woman and when a witness of this assault comes to her aid, Eva denies any help, claiming that it was her fault, and in some ways, she's right.<br /><br />What we as the audience are manuvered through here in this film is a mystery. What exactly happened to bring this attractive, wealthy and intelligent woman down to a woman who seems to be devoid of anything resembling happiness, wealth and why is she so hated in this community? When we first see her with Kevin, we see a woman who feels none of the natural maternal bond that one is supposed to feel with their child. We also see a child who is either responding to that lack of a bond, or a child who is already set on the road to becoming a psychopath. The mystery is in the unraveling of the events that lead to an emotionally terrifying climax, but smartly Ramsay keeps the more visceral parts to a minimum.<br /><br />The idea of Eva being drenched in red throughout the film, whether from the paint, the lights outside a hotel window, the blinking of a digital clock or hiding in a grocery store against shelves of tomato sauce is obviously very deliberate since we are looking at a woman who sees her own hands as that of a modern Lady MacBeth; she has, from her own anger and disappointment and displeasure for her son, forged someone lethal and unable to form any real human emotions potentially because of the disconnect between them.<br /><br />From a performance standpoint, Swinton is flawless as Eva. She always keeps the audience on their toes as to how to feel about her. It's a very complex character and our judgments about her are equally complex from the way that she plays it. Is she somehow as monstrous as he is? Since we only really see hints of her other relationships, most of her moments as far as with the family are with Kevin, and there is a resentment and a perhaps an absence of any connection with her son almost immediately; does Kevin somehow feed off of that and learn from their dynamic? Ezra Miller plays Kevin as a somewhat classical \\"textbook\\" psychopath; he has an air of superiority about himself, particularly with Eva. All of his emotional reactions seem to play somewhat falsely to her, if not immediately. But still there's an intensity of purpose in his glare and his constantly cocked head as if he's looking to understand what other's are feeling and see if he can duplicate it. Reilly honestly doesn't have much to do here other than be the nay-sayer who explains away all of Eva's concerns about Kevin as if there's nothing to worry about. This is a shame, because Reilly can be a pretty extraordinary dramatic actor and not just as a comic tool, as seen in some of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, and most recently in Roman Polanski's CARNAGE.<br /><br />Lynne Ramsay has a wonderful sense of style to her direction, and she wisely uses her palette and she wisely works more with implication than outright observation. Knowing the novel from Lionel Shriver, she has taken something that would have been controversial simply for its subject matter and instead of playing at that angle, she pulls us into the film for the way in which it handles the characters. A lesser director would not have done the same.<br /><br />The main reason I don't think this deserves a perfect review is while I understand that there is a good deal of unreality in the situations of this film, I find certain things and certain reactions difficult to believe. The film is highly stylized in a sort of hyper-realism, and perhaps I'm not seeing it for how it was created and more what I felt belonged.<br /><br />Still, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is bound to affect people for years to come, and thanks to Ramsay's direction and the performances of Swinton and Miller, it's certainly one of the most unsettling films I've seen in years.ately; does Kevin somehow feed off of that and learn from their dynamic?

0439023521|1.0|I was so sad to learn about this story and proud of my son for avoiding this book on his own.  The problem of the city dwellers being desensitized is the overall problem with this book. Subjecting ourselves to this content for entertainment is desensitizing.  I do not understand what we gain by offering this to our young readers.  The brutal killing of innocent children let by a government is horrible.  I cannot think of a book that has this kind of shock value like this in all of the books that I have read as a young person or even as an adult. The closest similar situation I remember reading about is the My Lai incident and as an adult I had a hard time with it. My son has read all of the Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Gahoole books, etc. but this series is way over the edge. My kids will not see the movie.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|The most obvious complaint one could broach about this third season of SPARTACUS (subtitled VENGEANCE) is the portrayal of the titular character by Liam McIntyre. Most fans are still not yet removed far enough from the terribly tragic passing of Andy Whitfield, who played the character with perfection. Most haters of this season say that McIntyre is just not on the same level as Whitfield. Is there truth to that? I think that there is, but it's less about McIntyre's actual abilities as an actor, which are considerable, and more about how much we miss Andy. Liam had some huge shoes to fill, and he knew going in that he was going to get a lot of flak from fans of the show.<br /><br />Now, I'm not the biggest fan of this series there ever was, but I will admit to my addiction to it. I find this season similarly entertaining and similarly predictible to the first two \\"seasons\\" of this show, but I was surprised to find that once Liam had been in a few episodes, I felt that it easily could have been him all along, which is certainly NO disrespect to Andy. I will also admit that McIntyre is a little wooden and not as emotional as Whitfield's Spartacus, but that is because this season holds less for Spartacus from an emotional standpoint than BLOOD AND SAND did. Part of Spartacus is already dead in this season, not only through the way that his relationship with Mira is portrayed, but also through his disregard of his own life as he seeks to strike at Glaber in any way he can. The role, and not McIntyre, is wooden. This is what's demanded of him; a role as steel-and-battle-forged leader to the fugitivus he now commands that look to him for leadership and counsel. Solemnity is required of the role now. That, and the uncanny ability to cleave head from Roman neck with a single blow.<br /><br />What is also a common complaint is that this show, while being extremely entertaining, rarely gives us anything that is truly surprising. We have a set amount of characters that we know nothing is going to happen to, and everyone else is pretty much the equivalent to a STAR TREK \\"red shirt\\". If we get to know them at all, it's for about five minutes. This is true. The show is very formulaic, but when it does break out the surprises, they're pretty mouth-gaping.<br /><br />Another common complaint is that this is essentially a mashup of Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR, Zack Snyder's 300, and HBO's brilliant ROME... with a heaping helping of late-night Cinemax for good measure. If you're coming to this show for truly original entertainment, you've looked at the wrong place. There is much politicking in this show, but not as clever or as strongly written as ROME. There is also a feeling that this show acquired its entire visual aesthetic from 300 with a lot or fast-slow-fast fights, dark-light-dark color palette and lots of slo-mo explosions of blood. This is true as well and I invite debate on that point (but only civil debate, please). And as far as GLADIATOR goes... well, that's just from a plot standpoint and somewhat rehashed plot is hardly worth criticism.<br /><br />Another common complaint was that of a new Naevia, played not by Leslie-Ann Brandt, but Cynthia Addai-Robinson. This is a much different Naevia than was portrayed before, and with good reason. But the skill is there and she makes a fine addition to the cast.<br /><br />Another common complaint is the dialogue which seems unnatural and overly polished with poetic license. To that I say... close mouth. This is a highly stylized show and it greatly benefits from having equally stylized dialogue.<br /><br />I don't think that any of the great creative minds that created this series, from Steven S. DeKnight (formerly of the Whedon posse and SMALLVILLE) to Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert, were ever looking to reinvent the wheel here. They took a risk on a somewhat serious show that week after week offered extremely handsome men, extremely beautiful women, and orgiastic showerings of bloody deaths and wild sex. I do think that they do a good deal of justice to the Rome that was, but I'd be more apt to ask a historian about the show's accuracy.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a very entertaining, and occasionally very smart, show with more than enough to keep even the most jaded fan coming back for more.nd wild sex.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have two college aged kids and they play this with their friends.  They really get into it and have also bought the expansions.  I was shocked at how much they were into it and it is challenging and fun,<br /><br />I don't have geeky kids by the way.  They never played dungeons and dragons or  anything (though video games was and is a favorite of my son).
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game, thanks for the good times.  Very addicting and challenging.  Great job.  Download and enjoy. Awesome. So much fun.
B005PMNBNG|3.0|Well this is 4 buck so might as well buy the whole cd download.  M83 best song is \\"midnight city\\" by far.  All the other songs are interesting background music but not great.  I am  somewhat disappoint as this is a let down from [[ASIN:B0016CS0IK Saturdays = Youth]]].  Similar to how Enigma evolved over the years.  I like the female vocals, but like enigma, M83 album here, took all that out and you go one male vocal.  His tone was great in Midnight city and Saturday Youth, but for the rest of the cd he was lost.  Like Enigma 2 cd set this one became more instrumental, he was mostly just messing around with his synthesizer. I prefer quality or quantity and this cd/ album is more quality.  I listened to it for a few weeks before deciding.  It isn't as good as Saturday Youth.  Does still have that 80 synthesizer sounds.  Midnight City song very much like \\"the Smiths\\".
B004SBULWE|5.0|Fires are not very powerful, so having a bunch of stuff running makes a big difference, especially if you want to do things that require more memory. For example, after I killed a bunch of tasks, playing Temple Run became way easier and less laggy. You have to change the settings to low security for best results. If you leave it at the default setting you get an empty list.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|\\"Prometheus\\" is a prequel to the great classic sci fi film \\"Alien\\" (1979). It sets out to explain what the spaceship was doing, who was the big guy in the driving seat, and what the alien creatures were designed for. The film does a pretty job in these objectives, but the rest leaves a lot to be desired. This film is so bad I hardly know where to begin. But here goes...<br /><br />* Guy Pearce appears as an old man in makeup. The old man looks like Guy Pearce in old man makeup. Surely with a plethora of old men who are excellent actors (Mickey Rooney, Ernie Borgnine, Peter O'Toole), one of them might have been chosen. Or if the writers and producers had some real imagination, how about an old woman?<br /><br />* If it hadn't been for \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\", I could say that this was Charlize Theron's worst performance to date. She is simply terrible. This very talented actress has shown what she can do, but none of it is apparent here.<br /><br />* One of the chief virtues of \\"Alien\\" and its sequels was the dark foreboding, almost claustrophobic atmosphere. The brightness of this film is a stark contrast.<br /><br />* For a space ship on a 2 year mission to explore an alien environment, there is a stunning lack of military preparedness. Surely at the end of the 21st Century we have more lethal weapons at our disposal than a shotgun, 2 flame throwers, and a few .45 handguns.<br /><br />* For a group of so-called scientists, most of the participants act in a very unscientific manner and take chances that are unacceptable. Of course this gives us the drama we are looking for, but a more clever film would not have it originate in the unscientific behavior of the scientists. For example, in the late 21st Century why are they walking without their helmets on into this unknown environment prior to the mapping technology completing the task. And where are the remote probes which exist in 2012 and by the end of the century will surely be more advanced?<br /><br />SPOILER ALERTS (if it's possible to \\"spoil\\" a terrible film)<br /><br />* There are many incredulous plot flaws. For example, the giant alien walks from his crashed space ship through the poisonous atmosphere to confront Dr. Shaw. But it's already been established that he can only breathe in the \\"earth-like\\" atmosphere in the cave; otherwise he needs a space suit which he leaves behind. How did he do it? Did he hold his breath? Think how big his ship was. How long would it take him to go from his gigantic ship to the survival vessel? How would he even know there was a survival vessel and where it was? etc.<br /><br />* Since the earth spaceship is equipped with a robotic medical center, why would the center be configured only for male patients, especially when Weyland's own daughter is aboard?<br /><br />* It's also been established in \\"Alien\\" that the big guy died in the command seat in his spaceship. So if he died elsewhere, who was in the seat? It was established that everyone else was dead. Or maybe there was another spaceship also with a giant engineer guiding it also equipped with alien creatures that also crashed? Yeah, maybe!<br /><br />* The robot chooses to kill Dr. Holloway by putting some alien substance in his drink, but there is no rationale for this since the robot's mission is to help Dr. Weyland meet the \\"engineers\\". Killing Dr. Holloway does not advance this agenda and in fact puts the mission at some peril since Holloway is a valued member of the crew.<br /><br />* As a prequel to \\"Aliens\\" there is an abominable discontinuation between that film and this one.  For example, there is a vast difference between the means of impregnation in this film (a gigantic creature) and the impregnation in \\"Aliens\\". What comes out is also vastly different.<br /><br />* If the start of the film is accurate, the alien engineers have enormous technological capabilities. They create the humans in our world with exquisite engineering. So why would they be wasting their time with the type of killing machine which the alien creature represents?<br /><br />The film isn't completely worthless and there are some nice touches here and there, like the sterile Shaw getting pregnant with an alien, or the mapping technology. But these are few and far between.<br /><br />Given the talent and resources that went into making this film, it's a big disappointment.me with the type of killing machine which the alien creature represents?<br /><br />The film isn't completely worthless and there are some nice touches here and there, like the sterile Shaw getting pregnant with an alien, or the mapping technology.

B007P6VM4A|4.0|The Hives continue where they left off with the Black and White album. Pumping out a polished and catchy album that is Lex Hives. Not only has the group lost alot of their raw sound from their early efforts, but the lyrics have become simpler as well. There are several songs on this release, including opener \\"Come On\\", \\"Go Right Ahead\\", and \\"Wait A Minute\\" where the title of the song is repeated almost the entire track. Still what the album lacks in creativity it mostly makes up for in catchiness.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Don't waste your time with this game! It's not that the game isn't good,it's gameloft's lack of maintenance and poor customer service that makes it not worth the trouble. The game constantly freezes and it's pretty much impossible to add friends. Gameloft would show that you had friends but they never showed up in the game,so missions involving help from friends were out of the question. They make it super hard to get lumber and when you buy a sapling it never grows into a tree,but the final straw was losing all of my progress after I reinstalled the game to try and get rid of these glitches and to make matters worse,I had just purchased cash with my own money and it was gone too! I was close to level 40 and I had to start all over. I'm not going to waste my time. I've contacted gameloft and so have many others about the poor quality of this game and so far,all I've gotten is an automated reply.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book at the airport to read on a long flight after having heard a few 'friends' rave about it. Needless to say, I will no longer be following their advice of what is a good read. The author seems to have decided that the repeated use of a handful of awkward and not so clever words and phrases that she has no doubt read in some 3rd rate books, are somehow going to impress the reader and has used them over and over and over and over....to the point that you WILL roll your eyes, throw the book and finally just laugh out loud in disbelief when you come across them YET AGAIN. I mean seriously, she is 'flushed' or 'blushed' at least 30 times in the first 50 pages (and that's before any of the sex scenes begin) and keeps using the term 'he regards me...' to describe the way he looks at her. Besides this nonsense, the writing overall is barely beyond basic literacy, the characters have no depth, reality / believability to them and the 'eroticism'...well, I'm sure it would impress a 12 year old virgin somewhere. The funniest part is that the main character's literary hero is Thomas Hardy. I'm sure Mr. Hardy has made a few turns since the publication of this book!<br />Honestly, it is beyond me that this book made it through editing and into publication. If I could give it minus 10 stars I would have. Now I have to decide what to do with the book. Donating it to the library would be a crime.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The unique convention of telling this story from a 5-year-old's point of view elevated this novel from good-but-nothing-special to extremely-interesting.<br /><br />The story is simple,  but the pace of revelations makes it compelling.  A 19-year-old girl is kidnapped on her way home from college and imprisoned for 7 years.  In that time she has given birth to her son, Jack, the 5-year-old narrator of the story.<br /><br />In the first half of the book, this back story is gradually revealed through Jack's thoughts and feelings and the details of their daily routine.  Despite Jack's sensory limitations - his mother tells him that everything in \\"Room\\" is real while everything outside is TV (not real) - Jack is generally a healthy and intelligent child.  Shortly after he turns 5, however, the situation with the kidnapper escalates - he's lost his job and the house is being foreclosed upon. The kidnapper, \\"Old Nick\\", enacts a frightening punishment for a perceived infraction.  He turns off the heat and does not bring food for 3 days.  Ma (we never learn her name) decides that it's time to escape and, with Jack's cooperation, she succeeds in getting Jack out, leading the police to her prison (a converted garden shed), and getting Old Nick arrested.  This is the only part of the story that stretches the reader's credulity, but the second part of the novel is good enough to overcome this minor flaw.<br /><br />The second half of the book deals with Jack & Ma's lives after the rescue, and I found this part to be the most compelling and realistic.  The adjustments they have to make to become part of \\"Outside\\" are significant and we're not always sure they're going to make it.  But they always remain true to one another - trusting each other as they could no one else in their lives.  The end is not earth-shatteringly surprising, but it is a redemption/revelation of sorts and is a very satisfying conclusion to the story.<br /><br />Nothing fancy here - just a great story toldin a straightforward manner.  A very good read!
B007SGM084|5.0|Heard all the talk about the books and wanted to read them.  At first it was a little out of my comfort zone but totally understood. Once I kept reading.  Then couldn't put them down.  Read them so fast reading a second time to really enjoy the story.

B004SRWW0C|5.0|I am old fashioned, or so most will say, but I remember when I used to make a purchase, it was MINE.<br />Let me explain:<br />When a person bought something, it was theirs, to do with as they pleased. After all we paid for it, we paid any and all taxes, paid for the upkeep, paid for any necessary repairs, etc. So when, did it become acceptable for a merchant to sell something and tell us how we are to use it. What we have access to or not, literally control how we use our purchases.<br /><br />That is the reason I purchased Root Explorer. After rooting my phone, I wanted a product that would give me no nonsense access to every file on my phone. I wanted to be able to decide which file or directory to keep, or delete. Root Explorer does exactly that, gives me full control of my phone, The way it was, The way it used to be! Thank you for a great piece of software

B007U1FEJE|4.0|If you were expecting something deep from the Legendary Beach Boys, you'll be disappointed.  Fun?  Yes, alot of new uptempo songs for the summer of 2012!  introspective?  Yes, though not as deep as say when you were in your 20's with life ahead of you: Now you are in your late 60's, and....perhaps the last song says it best...Summer's Gone.....but let's start from the beginning<br />Reminiscent of Our Prayer, Think About The Days kicks off the album with those harmonies!  Yes, they still have it!  That's why God Made the Radio starts off the nostalgic trip and reminds us of Brian's love of music, sharing that vision with us.  Shelter hints of another BB song, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  But that's the beauty of Wilson's writing\\": the layers, the different things going on simultaneously in any BB record.  Mike Love contributes Daybreak Over the Ocean which is a very pleasant, nostalgic yet melancholy yearning of lost lost and magical times. Beaches in Mind revisits Do It Again & Getcha' Back if in theme only.  The remaining songs revisit the past in varying degrees: Strange Times-what a world we find ourselves in, that has evolved around us.  PHC is an open, honest plea longing to go home.  Summer's Gone is the acceptance of the final realization that all good things must come to an end.<br /><br />I listened to Pet Sounds, followed by the Smile album, and wondered what would have happened if things had gone as planned, and there wasn't a 40 year gap between the albums.  It's then you understand what a gifted writer and visionary Brian is.  The Beach Boys vehicle limited his creativity while most of his solo efforts expand that vision.  The problem with the Boys' comeback efforts were centered around the idea of relevance, that's why Kokomo was such a pleasant surprise when it became a hit, old, yet new and refreshing.  The title track of this album may have the same impact.  It is good to have the Beach Boys back together again.  We miss you Carl & Dennis-we'll see you soon!s-we'll see you soon!
B0081KTI0E|4.0|The storyline for the movie was awesome, but the ending was horrible. Very impressed with Daniel Radcliffe. Thought I'd see him as Harry Potter throughout the movie,but his acting was very good that it made his character very believable. Awesome movie,but hated the ending.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This app is great! And if you get evernote too, it's super awesome. Why? Because you can make/upload a fun picture, and make a caption or tell a story about it.
B007V80WUC|5.0|Circus Maximus back in top form. This cd is proof that to make a progressive metal album, isn´t necessary write  very long songs(only three songs exceed five minutes). This work are as good as their previous two albums. In this cd have been less influenced by Symphony X and many more own personality.I really loved that little step taken towards a more AOR background, but not get me wrong, the force is still the purest style Circus Maximus.Very goooood work!!!!
B006H3MIV8|5.0|\\"And if my thought-dreams could be seen They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.\\" For nearly 50 years I have been an on-again/off-again, runnin' hot and runnin' cold fan of Bob Dylan. I am also a long-time supporter of Amnesty International, in part because I am outspoken and if I lived in a totalitarian country of left or right I am certainly of the type who would be tortured and killed, and so I relate to the innocent sufferers who Amnesty campaigns for.<br /><br />What a great if imperfect pile of music is provided on these four CDs. There are songs of Dylan that I never heard or never paid attention to, that I have now fallen in love with. Sometimes this is due to the clarity a new voice gives to the words, opening up the song like a Bible. There are singers that I never listened to, like Adele, or would never listen to, like Miley Cyrus, or who I've never even heard of, like Thea Gilmore, Carolina Chocolate Drops and Evan Wood, whose albums and/or songs I have now added to my most played selections. There are singers singing songs that I have long cared for but which now go straight into my soul/stimulate my endorphin production--like Jackson Browne doing Love Minus Zero and especially Carly Simon doing Just Like a Woman and Billy Bragg doing Lay Down Your Weary Tune. Many of these singers are just complete surprises to me on their own and doubly surprising doing Dylan.<br /><br />But the best aspect of the collection has been its causing me to rethink and renew and deepen my long-standing interest in Dylan. By showing me new ways of looking at old songs and by uncovering songs that are new to me, my inquisitiveness has been peaked. I have since acquiring this CD collection, purchased half a dozen Dylan albums and numerous songs. I have purchased alternative takes and multiple versions of songs sung by various artists. And purchased CDs and songs by artists I hadn't even heard of before. I've even now, after all these years, read three Dylan biographies, totry to make sense of this arrogant, oblique yet humane musical genius.<br /><br />Yes, not every song is a delight and there are some songs I immediately hit the skip button for. But given the cause--Amnesty International--and the almost startling insight the myriad of musicians give into one of our greatest singer songwriters, you can't go wrong by buying this CD collection. If you listen, you will find at least half a dozen songs that are so wonderful that each alone would make the purchase worthwhile. Buy it!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|The more I do the more I like this game, needed to go on line for more detail on how to play.  After that it's history and fun. Thanks for the challenge.
0446364495|1.0|Normally I wouldn't bother reviewing a tacky romance novel, because they're all so similar.  But this one took my breath away.  Basically, a photographer who thinks he's the last cowboy falls in love with a farm wife, they have a four-day love affair, and she makes him leave without her because she doesn't want to hold him back, and \\"to do that would be to kill the magnificent, wild animal that is you.\\"  She spends the rest of her life moping about it.<br /><br />Robert was such a pseudo-intellectual.  He kept spouting all this philosophical gibberish about how the world was too organized for him, and his Darwinian branch was a dead end, and so on.  His attempts to be poetic made him sound self-absorbed and way too serious - he described himself as the highway, a peregrine, and all the sails that ever went to sea.  He thought that \\"wizards are there, if you look closely enough.\\"  Francesca reminded him of \\"blowing sands, and magenta winds, and brown pelicans riding the backs of dolphins north along the coast of Africa.\\"  In a letter, he wrote, \\"And slowly - rolling and turning in adagio, in adagio always - ice-man falls...from Dimension Z...and into her.\\"  In the same letter, he wrote that he had visions of forest trails, mammoths, and fish while driving.  How come he still has his driver's license?<br /><br />He'd had so many girlfriends before the story took place, I wondered if he was lying when he wrote Francesca that he wasn't with anyone else afterwards.  The silver chain with Francesca's name on it might not have been his only silver chain.  Maybe he had a silver chain for every one of his numerous girlfriends.<br /><br />When they first met, it said Robert could tell Francesca was intelligent, but she never did anything smart during the whole book except agree with what Robert said.  As a teenager, she actually expected handsome sailors to go looking for her.  She was mean to her dog, too - when they were making love, it said Jack the collie \\"wanted in.  Hecould stay out.\\"  Richard, her husband, was pretty much the only likable character.<br /><br />The part where Francesca's kids find out about it after she dies was even worse.  In her letter, it was all about herself, except the part where she wondered if her kids would fall in love like she did.  Her daughter Carolyn sobbed, \\"We treat our marriages so casually, and we were part of the reason an incredible love affair ended the way it did.\\"  Realistically, she and her brother Michael would have been horrified.  But of course, Robert James Waller is probably much too intellectual, artistic, and sensitive to care what lowbrows like Michael and Carolyn would think.<br /><br />The worst part, though, was that Francesca had a wonderful, kindhearted, hardworking husband, but she cheated on him with some photographer she'd only just met.  She treated him so badly.  I feel sorry for him.  If she had run off with Robert, though, she probably would have gotten sick of him before long and cheated on him with someone else, anyway.<br /><br />It's kind of a shame - Robert would probably have made a good fantasy novel character if he was younger, wasn't obsessed with females, and wasn't so highbrow.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness is the first book in the All Souls Trilogy. I would have to say that is a paranormal romance (PNR) for the sophisticate due to the fact that it is not your typical PNR novel. I want to first point out that Ms. Harkness is a history professor at the University of Southern California and a wine connoisseur. She writes a great wine blog, Good Wine Under $20. All while reading this book; I craved some serious wine and wanted to know more about the history of alchemy. I can't imagine the research it took to write this amazing novel.<br /><br />Ms. Harkness created a wonderful character in Diana Bishop. She is a witch in deep denial. Diana has incredible innate magical power. However, in her mind, everything has a scientific and historical context. Magic really has no room in her life. She is intelligent, strong and independent. Then her life is turned upside down when in the Oxford Bodleian Library she calls up an enchanted alchemical manuscript, Ashmole 782. She feels it's magic but doesn't understand it. She sends it back to the stacks of the library. By opening the ancient manuscript, she has pulled all kinds of supernatural creatures to her. Quickly, she is surrounded by witches, daemons, and vampires. They all want the manuscript which could hold secrets to their existence. One vampire in particular has been looking for Ashmole 782 for centuries. Matthew Clairmont is a 1500-year-old vampire who has obsessed about the origin of his species. He would do just about anything to get ahold of that manuscript. He is secretive, controlling and powerful and he would change Diana's life forever.<br /><br />I love all the scientific, historical and alchemical references in the book. It's the reason I call it a PNR for the sophisticate. Ms. Harkness's description of all the alchemical illustrations is so vivid. To me, each image just jumps off the page. Just like her illustration descriptions, her use of wine in the story also enhancesthe imagery of the book. I love the aroma and the taste of each wine and I want to savor each drop. Her depiction of each wine really helps in describing each character, especially Matthew. I can see him savoring each sip of a deep, rich red wine. Each character has their own particular drink that they prefer and which fits each personality. Matthew loves wine. Diana drinks herbal tea. Aunt Sarah loves her whiskey as does Marcus. It really, for me, paints a wonderful personality for each character.<br /><br />As I focus on the academic references and wine, at the heart of this book is a forbidden romance. I really enjoyed the portrayal of Diana and Matthew's relationship. She is a witch who feels quickly while Matthew is a vampire who takes his time (he has all the time in the world). Furthermore, vampires and witches have hated each other for ages. They are not supposed to love each other. But they do and it works. You feel their passion, doubts and conflicts. You want a happily ever after, but will it happen for Diana and Matthew? Time will tell! Literally!!<br /><br />Like any good book in a trilogy, it ended with one heck of a cliff hanger. I absolutely can't wait for the next book, Shadow of Night. Its release date is July 10, 2012. I will buy it the minute it comes out.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|For those that whine about it not having its orginal songs, please stop. The licensing and publishing fees for all those songs are not cheap and Glenn DID state that it became as issue releasing the series. Asside from that, this was one of my favorite shows growing up in the 90s and I was excited when I heard it was coming to DVD. Wonder when a blu-ray edition will be available ;)

B001OMJGD0|4.0|I was disappointed with the film, but only because it was approaching perfection.  The flaws stand out the closer you are to that ultimate goal.  If you have not seen it, though, it is well worth watching as it is easily the best Superman movie made so far.  The only bothersome things, to me, are questions about Superman's morality in personal matters (which may actually appeal to some) and the plausibility of him overcoming a certain crippling element which is supposed to render him helpless.  Oh, and some of the \\"homages\\" to previous films are a little too much like \\"copying.\\"  The acting, cinematography and music are great, though!  This movie is very heroic.
B007Y36K46|2.0|I was excited to watch this movie. However if u watch this better have a clearplay they have bad language and take God's name in vain something I really didn't expect from a Disney movie and I am a huge Disney fan. I was very disappointed.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series is one of my favorites. Bosch, an LA police detective, is such a well drawn interesting character. Connelly's plots are compelling with lots of unexpected twists. This book is a definite page turner.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|\\"I'm coming for you.  I'm coming home, and I'm coming to clean.\\"<br /><br />I got goosebumps (the good kind!) when I read those words at the end of Book 4.  If you've read \\"Wool\\", you know the speaker is NOT talking about vacuuming.  If you haven't read it, what are you waiting for??<br /><br />I first learned of \\"Wool\\" last month when I read on an entertainment news site that Ridley Scott had purchased the movie rights to a self-published book by a largely unknown author.  I checked it out on Amazon and saw all of the fantastic reviews.  I'm partial to post-apocalyptic novels, so this was a no-brainer.  I was hooked by the end of the brief first book, wondering what had driven Allison and Holston to their fates.  And when Juliette's story kicked into high gear, I couldn't stop reading until the end.<br /><br />To Hugh - congratulations on your success.  I can't imagine what all of this must feel like for an author.  Keeping my fingers crossed that a movie will come to fruition!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome read!! When finished, you are beyond thrilled that there is another to continue this saga. Read the whole trilogy.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is my new favorite game. Watch out Mahjong. I would highly recommend this game too anyone who provides puzzles.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This movie was fantastic.  Mathew Vaughn is an incredible director as also proven in X-Men: First Class.  I was disappointed that he will not be directing the second Kick-Ass, but as long as he will be producing it, I am looking forward to it.  But back to the movie, the acting was great.  Aaron Johnson played his character well and Nicholas Cage was very funny.  Chloe Grace Mortez was unbelievable in her role as Hit-Girl.  The plot was good and there were a few turns that I wasn't suspecting.  After watching this movie, I purchased and read Kick-Ass (The Graphic Novel).  It was good, but not as good as the movie.  The movie is a great price for the threesome.  The blu-ray disc, the DVD,and the digital copy which some people apparently had some trouble with but it worked perfectly for me.  If you like funny, violent, inspiring movies then I would definitley recommend this to you.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this is a great app. I would recommend this for anyone with a kindle. it passes the time for anyone
0785152458|4.0|Just like the first book, this was graphic and extremely entertaining.  Mark Millar comes up with some impressive ideas, although some are quite disturbing and I would not want to see them in a movie.  Which is supposedly coming out next year.  All in all, this book was entertaining, and I can not wait to see it as a movie because the first one was amazing. I purchased the graphic novel along with the movie. Which, right now is only $8 for a blu ray disc, a dvd, and a digital copy that worked for me and I would recommend it.  Kick-Ass (Blu Ray, DVD & Digital Copy) -[...]  Kick Ass (Graphic Novel)  - [...]

0805092447|5.0|\\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\\" was one of the first book i read back in kindergarden and it was one of my favorite books ever. It had the perfect feel and look of a beginner book. We see a lot of animals and a lesson in this book.<br />With a singing rhythm, the story follows the narration of the sense of seeing of animals of many: a brown bear, a red bird, a yellow duck, a blue horse, a green frog, a purple cat, a white dog, a black sheep, a goldfish, a teacher and a group of children.<br />Kids will totally fall in love with this book. The story will help kids learn the world of senses and colors, especially when it's being sung to them, of course. I read this book many times back in kindergarden and it's certainly one book that kids under 5 will enjoy.

B0079XPUOW|3.0|I've read most of John Scalzi's material and enjoyed all \\"Old Mans War\\" and the variations immensely. Red Shirts is a fine (short) read and it is best to skip the Codas, as another reviewer mentioned. As funny and enjoyable as it is, it should be in a collection like The Best SciFi of (insert year year) edited by Dozois. Very good story for Star Trek fans but poor value at the current price. Keep writing, John!

B002GYI9C4|5.0|I met Brandon Sanderson at BayCon 2012 and was impressed by what he had to say in several writer's panels. I am a writer on a mission to stretch out of my reading comfort zone (Millennium Trilogy, Hunger Games Trilogy, Twilight?!). I asked him, given that I don't read epic fantasy, which of his books he would recommend. He suggested this one.<br /><br />Excellent.<br /><br />I am a hard science-fiction, thriller kind of guy but I was immediately hooked by the characters and by the chain of events leading toward a slave rebellion. What could be more thrilling than the prospect of freedom for millions of oppressed people? What could be more exciting than sympathetic characters caught up in the center of this storm?<br /><br />The characters were deep, flawed, noble, wounded, and well rounded from the get-go, but what I really liked about this book was Mr. Sanderson's magic. It is not magical, it is a science and a technology with it's own set of built-in constraints, flaws, strengths, and weaknesses. Yes, the main characters have access to magic, but their knowledge is less than perfect and magic is not what propels the story forward. Nor is it magic that saves the day when disaster strikes. It is who these people are, the relationships they form, and what they learn about themselves on their epic journey toward freedom.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Book #2 is on my Kindle now.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006R02QJ0 All Fall Down]]

0345803485|2.0|I've read many types of erotica and romance type books and there are many good ones out there. This is not one of them. I knew what was going to happen after about the 5th chapter. I've been told that the second one is better, but I'm not sure I want to waste my money.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great way to kill time and have fun doing it. Five stars all the way. The controls work great once you get the hang of it.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Akerfeldt and Wilson have created something here that doesn't really have any comparison. It's progressive certainly but not really rock or metal.<br />However, you can definitely hear both of the legendary artists' influences in every song, rather equally over the whole of the album.<br /><br />The music is ambient at times and the guitar is acoustic. There's really no sense in trying to describe the album, in depth, as it really has to be listened to. Storm Corrosion, is subtly amazing.<br />You are going to have to listen to each song several times to fully appreciate this work of art, (like all good music).<br /><br />If you're a fan of either artist, this is a must have. If only because you will be listening to something very original, both alike but also very unlike other projects these artists have done.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyed all three books.  It had romance, lust, sex, suspense... A new and different fairytale, with a happy ending ofcourse.
B006LSZECO|5.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" is a masterfully crafted novel by an extremely talented writer  I found myself at times holding my breath and not wanting to put the book down.<br />However, I am not terribly sure that I'm glad I read it!<br />This book is not for the faint hearted.  It is a dark, twisting walk through the corridors of a very bad marriage and it is impossible to finish it without being affected.<br />The psychological aspects of this story reach out and pull you in and make you wonder if it is possible to ever truly know anyone.  READER BEWARE!!!
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I was very upset fo find out that a photo  I had taken of my driver's license was automatically uploaded to a public album by my phone's resident app.  When resolving this problem, I also discovered that this resident app did not have options - it was all to a public album or no upload at all.  That scary experience lead me to this little app which I absolutely love!<br /><br />PicFolio lets you select which pictures to upload to which albums, who gets to see them, as well as comment on the pictures before uploading.  You can then free up the space on your phone for more photos and still be able to view them all.  You can also use this app to download your photos back onto your phone, if you want.<br /><br />I use this app all the time and love it!
B007QSNMS6|5.0|What a privilege to get inside the heads of two of this generation's most extraordinarily creative and passionate businessmen.  Amidst a sea of books about social media, technology, innovation, and web and mobile trends, Velocity takes an entirely different and effective approach, focusing not on the business of digital but instead on the consumer - our needs, our wants, how to help us live richer, more fulfilling lives.  There is no magic formula, Ahmed and Olander contend, no perfect business model, no technological silver bullet.  Instead, success is about distilling the essence of opportunity to the invisibly obvious consumer needs and motivations, obsessing the consumer experience, and perfecting solutions through a process of testing and learning.<br /><br />Velocity is both a relevant business read and and a meditation in personal and professional development.  It takes the pomp and geek-speak out of technology and entrepreneurship, opting for a much more accessible, sincere dialogue between the two humble and successful authors.  There are parts of this book that I've literally read dozens of time in hopes that I'd memorize the simple, elegant prose and timeless lessons that are equally applicable to my 9-5 job as well as the broader career and life decisions I'm making at a time when digital is rapidly reshaping every aspect of society.<br /><br />This is a book that I will read and re-read for years.  It will be as timely in 50 years as it is now.  It's an incredibly easy and quick read that has all the right ingredients to help you think about your work, your life, and your passions in an entirely powerful and actionable way.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|I tried it and felt like it was to similar to andoku, or vice versa. Sure it may have a few more puzzle variants but how long will it take you to get through each one? I'll stick with my free andoku
0307592731|5.0|I don't have the  book with me now.  I wrote a review for Goodreads.  I grazed and gazed over the remarks above.  I didn't find it whiny or self-serving or whatever.  A lady who was in an emotional state because of loss, gets up, finds her tools of recovery and goes for it.  I'd call that gutsy, and found the book fascinating
B0002TL51C|5.0|I have this CD which I purhased over 20-some years ago and it was scratched. Have searched for this CD for years and was DELIGHTED to find it.  I have no idea where the vendor originally obtained this particular CD, but WOW!  I treasure it!  GREAT meditation music from an awesome artist.
0547569653|5.0|I purchased this book the 1st day it was released and just now finished it feeling very satisfied. This entire novel has really compelled me to keep pushing towards healthier living, and keeping my dedication to staying in shape. From reading about Scott's up bringing, to connections made, friends made, and competing in Ultra Marathons, you really get a great sense of the true essence of running and the importance of it.<br /><br />It really is an eye opener being able to feel like you are somewhat delving into the life of someone who has witnessed many things that most people will never come close to. Eat and Run kept me wanting to read more even after I finished.<br /><br />This book did a fantastic job at recalling all the highs and lows Scott endured, which in the end, got him to where he is today. Anyone who loves to run, or just has some curiosity in Ultra Marathons will no doubt take much interest in this book and not be disappointed.<br /><br />Side Note: I loved the recipes included between each chapter transition. Will definitely be trying some of them out!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A basic calculator. Easy to read and see. Works anywhere which is a good feature and is not WiFi dependent. Nice bonus is that it let's you see the problem that you input, whole still providing the answer. Great when you need to calculate without all the unnecessary extras!

B004EPYZPS|4.0|A movie in a movie.<br /><br />Teenagers making a horror movie find themselves in an alien horror situation.<br />Shades of young Spielberg and Alien and E-T.A movies.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This Solitaire version is actually very good game, having a lot of customizable playing and \\"Look and Feel\\" options but is marred by intrusive ads that come up when you deal a new hand. I don't usually mind ads in free apps since they allow developers to continue making apps for free, but these are very annoying since they have to be cleared by hand and they include video ads that you can't be dismissed until they are done running... the first one was for Gin (the booze, not the game) and certainly not an ad that I want to come up when in my doctor's waiting room.<br /><br />That being said, this game did install cleanly on my HTC EVO 4G and my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />CFH
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is my favorite game on my kindle. For all of you complaining about credits and invest points, this game isn't a one day thing, you accumulate them.
B007SGM084|3.0|These books were suggested by a client and were described as fabulous.  I found them to be more like glorified Harlequin romances and a bit over-the-top when it came to descriptive sex.  The story line is very good, and it is well written.  The right amount of suspense and moves along nicely.  I just thought it could have done without multiple pages of porn.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I loved this game! Challenging, numerous mini games and puzzles, amazing pictures, and a fun storyline! Definitely getting number 2!

B00785P2QC|5.0|good game game game game game game game game I like it so much much much much much much much
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Overall this game is great kinda like farmville. The only thing I don't like is how it has an energy that gets used up every time you do an action, so that's something to look for. Other wise it's FREE!
B00846REIS|4.0|I have to say that I enjoyed this better than 50 Shades.<br />Now the sotry line is VERY VERY close.<br />A man who has a secret past that he wont tell but effects him sexually and in his sleep.<br />A woman who has been abused sexually in her childhood, but by who???  And she is sharing an apartment with a man already.<br />Attracted to each other instantly and the sex is hot, hot, hot.  No bonadage, no pain, just pure raw sex.<br />And there is a story line that keeps you reading to see how the characters all fit in together.<br />Cant wait for the sencond book and hope there is a third.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is a lot of fun, and its nice that you dont have to spend money to really enjoy it
B000646L94|4.0|I always liked the movie so, I use it as resource for my classroom. A lot of people still don't understand how things were in the 60's. It's a rated R movie, so I get waivers from the students (8th graders) to watch it.<br />The delivery of the movies are always great..

She could have gone on to become a terrific actress if she'd wanted to.

B005N95JA4|5.0|Wow! I am playing the 10 bonus track CD more than the original these days!!! You simply have to buy the deluxe version of this great album. I am blown away by the 2nd disc. The songs are hugely enjoyable and reveal more every time you play it. This could easily have been another double album when it cam out in 1978. Fantastic stuff. Don't buy the standard recording. Spend a little more and get this version of the album. You won't be disappointed.
0307120007|2.0|The touch and feel aspect about this book is nice, however there is nothing very impressive about this book. Of all the children I've worked with, no child has been particularly fond of \\"Pat the Bunny\\". I feel like it has a very limited targeted age group - children who are old enough to follow the book's instructions and be captured by the story; but young enough to not mind it's otherwise simplistic nature. Maybe 15-30 months-old children?
B0055IU4GM|5.0|John continues in fine form with another wonderful recording. Such emotion, such fine writing, and such fine singing and performing. And this is 'just another' album. It's incredible just how talented this man is. Can't wait to see him on tour.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard about the big fuss over this book so I bought it. What a waste of money! I found nothing to recommend this book. The writing is amateurish and the characters unbelievable. Why a bright beautiful girl would even consider any sort of relationship with the main male character is beyond me. Nobody is that good looking! Save your money!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Everyone should watch this documentary. Even if you have your own opinions of the whole Wall Street debacle,  there are still so many talking points on this DVD. From a simply educational and awareness point of view, this is worth getting. It will amaze you, frustrate you and anger you. It shows how much we do need regulation of the financial market. Laws were put in place after the Wall Street crash to prevent what happened from happening again. But those regulations were slowly removed by Wall Street making politicians do their bidding and as memories faded over the years.  Capitalism can be it's own worst enemy and if left unchecked as it was from the 1980's onwards will ensure that this will happen again within the next 100 years. Greed knows no bounds and people have no morality when money corrupts. And the people who were directly responsible for the meltdown should have gone to jail. But of course no-one did.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Decent office suite for the money.  Was always a fan of a 'to go' competitor but the .99&cent; price made me decide to give it a shot.  Decent program for the price.  I don't like how it suggests add-ons without telling you that you must pay an additional $4.99 to download each one until you are at the download page.  Disabled those notifications and one that said it would &quot;automatically check for promotions&quot;.  I really don't like 'promos' showing up in my notification bar.  But otherwise, good office suite for. 99&cent;.

0345803485|2.0|Shades of Gray's character Christian Gray is a direct knock-off (though much less interesting, humorous or well developed)of Harlan Coben's Windsor \\"Win\\" Horne Lockwood III. Rich - check; deviant -check; handsome -check.  And there, the similarities wane and Win leaves Christian in the dust.  Win is funny, Win fights bad guys, Win knows Karate, Win knows pop culture.  The \\"sex-stuff\\" is referenced with Win, but not directly addressed.  With Christan, it is middle school infatuation and shock value  S & M, ad nauseum. Like drinking cheap wine, after having a taste of the good stuff. Ick.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Larger puzzles should fit on screen, or at least have a scroll or pinch and zoom feature. Having to drag the whole puzzle is awkward and can occasionally cover the line of unused pieces. There seems to be no way to save a puzzle's progress to finish it later. This is annoying for the larger puzzles. If you have a large grouping of pieces that you're trying to join to another group, they won't snap together as easily as individual pieces.
1848366159|2.0|If you are just catching trains around to see major cities, then the guide is adequate.  written descriptions are based on arriving at the train station with directions in relation to this arrival point.  Often this train station also hosts the english speaking Tourist Information Centre where you can pick up local brochures etc for greater planning detail as you train-travel around on your holiday.<br /><br />As soon as you want to do any independent travel to see mountains and volcanoes, the guide becomes completely inadequate with a fustrating lack of maps making the book worthless and instead you end up using google earth.  Whilst each chapter has a small regional map at the start, there is virtually no 'inset' style maps for any of the localities described inside each chapter.  This leads to some wordy descriptions trying to explains things much easier seen on a map - a picture paints a thousand words.  Take for example the walks around Karuizawa (page 343)\\"about 1 km north of the station....heading northwest along the main road it is 2km....follow the road north from here past the camp gound to Kose where a 10 km hike to the scenic Shiraito Falls starts\\".  These falls are about 13-15 km away from the railway station somewhere to the northwest and I couldnt even find it on Google Earth!  Given that very few people in rural japan speak english there are many recipes like this in the book for getting hopelessly lost!  The book basically provides no guidance on getting around by car and was completely silent on how you get between Honshu and Hokkaido by car which I would have thought is an obvious issue of interest for many independent travellers?<br /><br />I also got the Lonely Planet and Frommers Japan guides and whilst these guides have an occasional smatter of small inset maps for some of the features, There seems to be no clear winner in terms of a guide book catering for guiding on outdoor pursuits - the lonely planer Hiking in Japan is excellent for some of the best hikes but doesnt have widespread more generalised outdoor covereage.f the best hikes but doesnt have widespread more generalised outdoor covereage.

0307957934|2.0|I was disappointed. This was my first Robert Harris novel, recommended by a friend. In reflection, I should have started with Enigma, or Fatherland, or Imperium. Those are regarded as Harris's better efforts. I will read those, but I think I made a mistake in starting with this one.<br /><br />My first comment is that this story is what I would call an intellectual, techno, suspense thriller. My second comment is that I figured out the identity of the antagonist less than 10% into the story, which means the intellectual part of the story didn't last long. Knowing where the story was going to end up took a lot of suspense out of it. Sort of like on a road trip on a long highway and just getting anxious to get to your destination.<br /><br />But my main disappointment with the story is that the main character is not very likable. Dr. Alexander Hoffman may be the most brilliant scientist in the world, but he's arrogant, insensitive, and has little interest in anything but himself, his precious algorithm, money or the manifestations of his money. I was twenty percent into the story and hoping Hoffman would get killed off so that the real protagonist could appear. No such luck. I kept asking myself, \\"Where's the good guy?\\" Maybe it's just me, but I have difficulty enjoying any story where I so dislike the main character.<br /><br />The story also moved forward slowly. The pace was consistent... just consistently slow. There is a ton of architectural description in the first quarter of the story. It starts with a laborious description of Hoffman's pretentious mansion and all the physical trappings of his wealth. When that description finally concluded, I was anticipating the story would start moving faster. Again, no such luck. A little while later, another laborious description happened, this time Hoffman's company's pretentious office building. The descriptions are very well written, lots of details, but it seemed to me like the author got a bit carried away with thesedescriptions. Since this is my first Robert Harris novel, maybe these kind of robust descriptions are part of his style, but to me they were overcooked.<br /><br />The descriptions of Geneva go on and on and on and on. Just as the story seems to get rolling, up crops another slug of Geneva description: roads, parks, buildings, even tourists taking pictures. You name it, it's there. At times I thought I was reading a travelogue. There was so much description that I started thinking of it as filler. Like a news caster on TV who runs out of news five minutes before the show ends and the director is telling the news caster to stretch the last piece of news in order to fill the time.<br /><br />A plot that held little suspense, a main character I didn't particularly like, and an excessive amount of description resulted in a story that I could only give 2-stars to.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why is this trilogy on all of the top best selling lists?? I considered many times buying this book but thought it was too expensive, particularly the kindle version (with no sharing rights), so I held off but eventually my curiosity got the best of me and decided to sample the book first. After reading the first two chapters, I can confidently say the writing is horrific! Didn't she have an editor? How can this work be published? Her sentence structure is so choppy it's extremely distracting. The author is also inconsistent with her writing style and with Ana's character - one sentence has her sounding like an intellectual woman and the next sentence has her sounding like an immature and simple-minded teenager. I have no desire to read any further...don't want to waste my money. I suggest you read the low rated reviews before buying this book. If you want a better written erotica story that basically has identical characters as Fifty Shades of Grey but with a more sassy and interesting female character, I suggest [[ASIN:0425263908 Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]] by Sylvia Day.

1451627289|5.0|I am a dedicated Stephen King fan, however, there have been times when I have found a book not quite to my liking.  This book about going back in time to change history was absolutely riveting, and as big as this volume is I had a really hard time putting it down.  It was believeable if you actually thought that a possibility could exist, in some way, to step back in time.  His detailed accuracy about that era, the tension of what was needed to be done and the characters that were so absolutely intertwined for this story flowed just beautifully.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone whether you are a Stephen King fan or not.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I was going between 4 and 5 star but gave it a 5 by the time the movie finished. Great acting. Great story. Two super starts make this indeed a great movie. People who think the conversations are too long can fast forward. I did that for a couple of minutes.

0790729393|1.0|Fairly entertaining.  Not boring.  The beginning, when the kids are young, is good.  Most of the end is pretty good too, except for the ridiculous courtroom strategy.<br /><br />Slight spoliers to follow >>> Murder victims do not need \\"character witnesses\\".  Maybe a glowing assessment of the murder victim during a sentancing hearing but not during the trial.  Further, the \\"alibi\\" stuff was nonsense.  If the murderers had the alibi Dinero gave them they would have told the police that during the investigation and the case never would have gone to trial.  Finally, you can't call witnesses with no notice to the prosection.  Absurd.<br /><br />The movie is 3 to 4 stars for entertainment.  They deal with the brutality fairly tastefully.  But only one star due to the stupid coutroom plot - plus I got tired to looking at Brad Pitt's nose job.  He was the worst in terms of acting (for better Brad Pitt acting see Meet Joe Black - though some say his acting there stinks).  Hoffman starts out slow, but gets better.  He plays the same character in every movie (i.e, since Rainman that is the only character he seems to be able to play).<br /><br />And what was the hideous Minnnie Driver doing in this movie?  She added nothing.  There must have been some legal obligation to stick her in a movie so they threw here in this.<br /><br />One last thing, (spolier alert >>>) watching Kevin Bacon get shot was worth the price of admission.  He plays someone evil in almost every movie.  Seems to come naturally to him.  I wonder if he really is evil.  Hmm ...
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|its a good quality movie, fills in plenty of holes but opens up many other unexplained for maybe part 2?<br />good flick for the sci fi fan
B0086700CM|3.0|It worked great for about two weeks, but it no longer allows me to move my character to the left and right by tilting the screen (kindle). This means that I cannot move past the 2000 meter (or so) point. Frustrating to say the least, and the bug needs tobe fixed soon!
B007Z9QWVK|1.0|Madonna should stick to the vapid pop culture milieu she is used to occupying, and stop turning history into gag me with a spoon fantasy.<br /><br />The truth about Edward VIII's Nazi links are based upon newly declassified FBI files.  The playboy prince and his relationship with Wallace Simpson, the twice divorced American he married, was a convenient pretext for forcing him into abdicating when the real reason had been deep establishment suspicion of his pro-German views. The British establishment was extremely forgiving towards Edward and deeply sympathetic to fascism.<br /><br />Simpson had been the lover of German Ambassador von Ribbentrop, (who went on to become Hitler's foreign minister); and as Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, Edward was earmarked by Hitler as a potential puppet king after the Nazi victory.<br /><br />If there had been an option to chose zero stars, I would have gladly done so.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|These discs wouldn't play and by the time I figured out there was no way to make them play (updating firmware, trying other players) it had passed the \\"return window\\" of 14 days (which I didn't know existed) so Amazon won't take them back. Complete waste of money.
B0068TL23G|3.0|This game is interesting and fun to play, but several aspects of the user interface are very annoying. First and foremost is the game doesn't allow you to delete a route unless it was the last one entered. It should be very easy to allow deleting any route, not just the last one. The second very annoying feature is the automatic advancement to the next pattern after a very short pause. You complete the routes, you get scored, and if you did not earn a perfect score, you don't get a chance to study your solution to see how it might be improved.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This may be the best book of the genre that I have read.  It is engrossing and interesting from start to finish.  It is extremely well written.  I am anxiously awaiting the sequel.

0446547654|5.0|I have always been a sappy happy ending girl..but I love Nicholas Sparks books. In most of his endings, he has a way of bringing it all around and making you see the good in people and leaves you feeling content. This is how real life happens, Nicholas Sparks leads us into that many times. We all want the happy ending and for the characters to end up together but isn't the lesson of finding good in bad situations more important? Go read a romance novel for the happy ending. Mr. Sparks, thank you for leading us to see more, that's what God wants us to do and I appreciate how you use your gift.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|this game is ok but it does have a few glitches like it doesn't let you make some moves when they are possible. but still good on kindle fire
B0086700CM|5.0|great game! nothing I really dislike about it<br /> functions great with the aneroid technology on my kindle. great graphics,  not forced into paying for anything you don't want to and still has good playing quality
B006RUJST6|3.0|I liked this book. It was a very cute, sweet, heartfelt story. I thought it was a nice young adult novel and love story.<br /><br />That being said, I did have a teensy problem with it. I really felt that Lake/Will needed a bit more interaction before they would be so crazy about one another. I know teenage girls fall in love fast and hard, but this story would have been so much more believable for me had they been on more than one date/kiss before the rest of the plot unfolded. However, when I suspended my disbelief over that I ended up enjoying this.<br /><br />It's not just a romance story, but a story about all different kinds of love. The slam poetry aspect was interesting and different. I'll be purchasing the sequel, I'm interested to see where the story goes from here.
1419702238|5.0|Very speedy delivery. This book is new and was ordered for one of my students who expressed his desire to read it.  He had already read most of the books in this series.
B007N0REX6|4.0|Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators' Apocalyptic Love is a really good rock n roll record.  It does a great job of building on the work Slash and Myles did together on Slash's first solo record \\"Slash\\".  Great guitar licks combined with Myles' phenomenal vocals fill the ears with a perfect blend of classic rock sound.  I truly enjoyed every song on the CD and the fact that the band recorded this CD in \\"live\\" sessions plays through brilliantly on every track.  Anyone out there who loves rock, Slash, and/or Myles must pick this up.  Highly recommended.

Thanks Amazon.
B0002DB52M|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece. I remember leaving the theater in shock, lacking words. Very much worth your time. Type of movie you're slightly recalcitrant about when you pick it and then that leaves yo a changed person two hours later.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is just pure awesomeness. I've had it for quite awhile now and it's a great game to just open up and play a level or two whenever you want. I never thought it was overly difficult like some reviews say. Fun fun game. Get it.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Great action movie. It did strike me as pure PR for the military though. Be prepared to learn that real men go to war. Other than this, one of the top action movies I've watched this year.
0060512806|5.0|its a long book, so i'll make this revew short. This book is the most fun i have ever had in literature, hands down. when i think about rereading this novel i become as a child on christmas eve: giddy with excitement. Cryptonomicon is the most male book i've read, it is actually written from the male perspective without constantly apologizing for it. if you're a man who likes to read, then you HAVE to read this book, and if you're a woman, why not give it a try.
B001NA6096|5.0|I guess this movie has become somewhat of a classic.<br />It is a lovely romance that will most likely recall memories to most of those who have been lucky to travel to Europe to study. Very endearing story, great acting. Just a fresh, charming movie.<br />This is the first of the series. And it's the real deal, no question about it.
0316066524|5.0|well, to put it plainly, this is one of the great works of fiction.<br /><br />and but so also this novel is not easy. though this novel isn't easy, nor will it be known for its brevity, that does not mean its hollow. it is not a work of plot, the plot is simply a grounds to explore themes of morality and addiction. if you cannot handle the plot not being resolved then don't bother, but please understand that the plot is not important.<br /><br />please read this, and try to understand it. there is jaw dropping beauty in this post-modern dystopic masterpiece, you just have to submit to it. its not beauty in the sense that one passage may seem more artful and stay with you, rather but it's beauty comes from an intense empathy. the whole novel is shaking you (the reader) telling you that there are other people, don't fall into the pits of solipsism.<br /><br />this is a masterpiece, please do not be swayed by the authors attempt to make it seem otherwise. its not straightforward, its not linear, the plot does not resolve at all, and its goofy, cartoonish and unrealistic. it is also one of the most moral and human novels i have ever read.
B006AN78XS|1.0|I guess we're so used to watching mediocre movies that some can be pleasant to watch. That is the case of this one. The movie is plagued by lamentable clich&eacute;s about France, French culture, and Paris. I think these clich&eacute;s only exist in the imagination of some snobby new yorkers any more.<br />This movie could be the work of a 25yo spoiled rich girl making a movie about life staged in Paris. Disconcertingly poor in terms of vision and message; eminently clich&eacute; in terms of its references. I'm not pro or against Woodie Allen - I find some of his movies good, some more repetitive and average. And I love Owen Wilson. So really, my review is not one of these anti-Allen ones.  I just found this movie somewhat insulting to watch. Clearly the work of an aging man that has no problem showering you with old clich&eacute;s and presenting them as  enlightening.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|For those naysayers out there, including many professional critics, I think you all missed the boat on this one.  No doubt there are connections between the Prometheus and Alien universes, but if you were looking for a real \\"Alien\\" prequel, you're looking in the wrong place.  This film had its frightening moments, but it was not billed as a fright fest a la \\"Alien\\" or any of the other films in that series.  For those of you that were young enough to remember, \\"Alien\\" received average reviews by top critics when it was released.  Don't go by the 97% on Rotten Tomatoes - most of those reviews were written and compiled years later when \\"Alien\\" became a classic - deservedly so.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" is far more cerebral than any of those films.  The story is based more in philosophy and religion than horror.  It is intelligent sci-fi at its finest, with a great story which mainly stood apart from \\"Alien\\".  Yes, the Weyland Corporation figured prominently here (later in the \\"Alien\\" series as \\"Weyland-Yutani\\" - M&A still happens in the distant future, ha ha).  But this is a different story.<br /><br />Were there plot holes?  Perhaps, but there were plenty of those in Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\", considered by many to be the pinnacle of science fiction movies.  Was Decker human or not?  Who cares.  Blade Runner turned out to be a classic.  So will this film.  Plot holes here can allow for interpretation as well, so don't get caught up in that baloney.<br /><br />IF you haven't seen it, get Alien, Aliens or any of its successors out of your mind.  If you do that, you will enjoy this film more.  Don't get caught up in the comparisons, or how one film is scarier than the other, etc.  Just sit back and enjoy it.  Beautifully filmed, great performances (Noomi Rapace will become a household name beyond her native Sweden) and a killer soundtrack.  And probably the best use of 3D I have seen to date.<br /><br />Ridley has done it again.  A sci-fi masterpiece.
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|Adam's first album was cool, but it did feel like he didn't know which direction he was headed. It was difficult to find an identity for the album.<br />Trespassing, on the other hand, has Adam Lambert written all over it, and, as he's proved before, that's a great thing. This is a fast-paced, upbeat, kinda-eletronic-kinda-rock'n'roll frenzy that is marvellous to just enjoy.<br />Favorites include the new single 'Never Close Our Eyes' (great vocals!), Kickin' In (very reminiscent of MJ!) and Broken English (one of the slower ballads).
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Just a great album from Joe. Sounds like he put his heart and soul into this album.  Lyrics are very personal and emotional.  Love how he has opened up for all to see.  He's not afraid to say how he was saved by something greater than him.  Not many celebs would be brave enough to do that.  And it's in more than one song.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think dis game is a good game nice action and graphics in it five stars up to this game I'm in love with samurai vs zombies defense. a very long love lol
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the books. I had heard about the movie and didn't think I would be interested. A friend told me he read them and he liked them. We have the same taste in books, so I gave it a shot. The first book is the best, the second is compelling and the third I sort of got lost and couldn't quite picture in my mind what was going on. I might have to re-read the third to get that picture. Over all the books  made for excellent reading. Enjoy!
0345803485|4.0|Let's face it, life eventually becomes dull in a married life. And it was pretty dull for a while in my case. Work - home and home  - work. So anyway, I told my husband that I am reading this book that everyone is talking about and that was that. Few days later, he comes up to me while I was reading it, all of a sudden all hot and bothered, takes me by the hand and leads to the bedroom.  And we had pretty steamy re-inaction of one of the scenes from the book, which took me by surprise. It hasn't occurred to me right away, just after the fact that his behavour was something new to me, something unexpected and surely HOT. So I asked him if HE read the book? He said no, but what turned him on was WATCHING ME READING IT!!!!! What? Was it THAT obvious that I was turned on reading it??? Now it's my turn to say Jeez and blush? I am in the end of the first book, but I guess it's improving our sex life already. I can't complain. The book is clearly not a literary epic and will not be nominated for Pulitzer prize, but it's good enough to take my mind off the mundane life. Reading it I can imagine myself being Ana and dating this hot billionaire. Dreaming is good and doesn't hurt anyone. And if in the process I get f*** more often than usual, all the better. What also helps is that if my hubby would lose about 15-20lbs, he would be pretty close to Mr. Gray's description (minus billions, red room and helicopter/airplane)so fantasizing is not much trouble.<br /><br />Why I am giving it only 4 stars is because of the writing abilities of the author. Is she 13? I am guessing not. But the main two characters of the book are by far unrealistic. Have you ever heard of 21 year old (apparently hot looking) virgin who flashes/blushes every 3 minutes, yet being able to achieve an orgasm at a drop of a hat. Claims to be so inexperienced and shy, yet be more than willing to go into all the shenanigans in the red room of pain? A virgin and a slut are contradicted in the same person who constantly talks to her inner goddess. I think there is some mental abnormality there. But that's OK, so the more interesting to read if you don't concentrate your mind to discect the characters. Now, the Christian. That perfect of a guy just doesn't exist. He is drop dead gorgeous, has billions, private jet, helicopter and huge appartment/art gallery in a sky scraper. He tries to save the world from hunger, can play piano, able to operate a helicopter and a glider, yet hardly works and doesn't like to be touched. And he is only 26 years old. Most of the people can't achieve all that in a lifetime.<br /><br />Now the writing language. Endless flushing? The girl who is easily turned on and eagerly wants a man at all times of day or night still manages to flush 10 times per page every time he says her name or just looks at her? Seriously? As well as murmuring... Flashing.. blushing.. murmuring some more and gasping. Those are the most popular descriprions in this book. After a little while that gets pretty annoying.<br /><br />And what's up with the description of vjj as \\"sex\\". I've never heard of anyone calling their v****a like that. It was a bit distracting to me as in my mind the word \\"sex\\" implies the action (or gender) and not a body part. Where did that come from?<br /><br />Apart from those small annoying details pertaining to writing, the book is worth reading, although it did not resemble Twilight to me in any way, shape or form, unlike I've heard. Thank God.<br /><br />I've heard that they are planning to make a movie based on this book. I hope Ian Sommerhalder gets the part to play Christian. He would fit the bill perfectly. So HOT.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is good for letting me combine photos text and drawings as a way to keep track of notes.  it doesn't organize allow notes as clearly as onenote though.
B0085A9J18|5.0|Here's some fun math for you...This entire film cost as much to make as ~52 seconds of Transformers 3.  I'll say that again.  For the same price, you could make either a) the best action flick since John Woo's Hong Kong masterpieces, or b) 52 seconds of bloated PG13 mediocrity.  Stunning.<br /><br />In any case, the second collaboration between Gareth Evans, Iko Uwais, and Yayan Ruhian demonstrates just how far you can take the form.  The plot is simple and straightforward, and set up with incredible economy.  A few carefully edited scenes and a smattering of dialogue puts all the pieces in place, then it's 90-odd minutes of exquisitely crafted mayhem.<br /><br />Technically, the film is very well shot.  The camera work is both fluid and at times surprisingly creative (they pull off a great drop-down shot early on using one camera but two cameramen).  Most importantly though, it's choreographed into the action itself.  The camera is the 3rd (or 4th or 10th) player in the fight scenes, moving with the actors to give the audience a clear view of the lightning fast techniques while highlighting the incredibly kinetic nature of the fights themselves.  And kinetic is the only way to describe the fighting.  The choreography in The Raid is the some of the most aggressive I've ever seen.  There's no dancing around, no sizing each other up, no slow-mo, and definitely no waiting around for a downed opponent to regain his feet so the fight can continue.  The actors go after each other like their lives really are at stake, attacking relentlessly from whatever position they find themselves in, using whatever weapon is available.  Silat (the primary martial art on display here) is a viciously practical close-quarters system, and it's full range of open-handed combination strikes, knees, elbows, and grappling techniques is on full display; along with some knife-work that's almost too fast to keep track of.<br /><br />This is a particular treat for martial arts fans who have seen alot of Karate, Kung Fu, or Muay Thai films.  The mobility and variety of attack angles employed by Silat fighters is distinct and makes the already aggressive choreography doubly unpredictable.  These guys never stop moving.  The stunt work is top notch, and you really get a feeling throughout the movie that these guys are hungry for it.  This is their big shot to bring Indonesian martial arts to a western audience, and they pull out all the stop to make it happen.  While the level of violence has been criticized by some as being gratuitous and misanthropic, what I see is an incredibly driven crew of young, talented Indonesians going balls-out to earn their indigenous martial art a permanent place in the genre canon.  As far as I'm concerned, they succeed and then some.<br /><br />One final thing that sets The Raid apart from most other martial arts flicks is the weird but successful blending with the survival-horror genre.  In between fights, Evans ratchets up the tension as the dwindling number of survivors try to evade roving bands of bloodthirsty killers.  This alternation between tension building stealth and explosive action keeps you on the edge of your seat pretty much the entire time.  It's a very smart way to do things, and avoids the usual curse of foot-taping \\"I'm bored, when's the next fight\\" the plagues a lot of genre films.  Not that there's any shortage of fight scenes.  I can think of plenty of martial arts movies for which the climactic showdown was less exciting than every single action sequence in The Raid.<br /><br />Anyway, I've gone on long enough.  This is the new high water mark for pure, unadulterated martial-arts mayhem.  I can't wait to see what these guys come up with next.
B000WITSZS|5.0|These guys are like if Black Sabbath and Jet had a kid. They really know how to rock! I like the whole album!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I can't believe the big wig top music reviewers for Rolling Stone and the sort only gave this 3 out of 5 stars!  This is better than his brother-in-laws recent CD by Ringo Starr 2012 I think!  But they both play on each others album and I love them both!  Just wanted to get the word out that Joe Walsh is back and stronger than he ever was on guitar and vocals!  This is a great rock and roll CD!  I bought mine at Best Buy and got the Limited Deluxe Edition which includes 2 extra songs on the CD (Fishbone and But I Try), a 17 minute DVD with live versions of Analog Man, Wrecking Ball and Lucky That Way and finally an X-large T-shirt that says \\"JOE WALSH FOR PRESIDENT!\\"
B000VSYDRM|1.0|I ended up turning this film off.  I chose it because of the cast and reviews, but it was slow, and quite boring.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is incredible. The author makes it easy for the reader get pulled into this book like one is living in the story.<br /><br />Anthony Ryan will soon be a name heard with the likes of Abercrombie, Martin, Cook, Jordan, Gemmell, and other great fantasy writers of our time. I daresay this book rivals those legends.<br /><br />I guarantee you will be absolutely mesmerized by the story and well developed characters. I can't wait for the next book.

0767827902|5.0|Based on the novel of the same name by world famous Texas author Larry McMurtry, the movie \\"The Last Picture Show\\" takes its name from an all-too-common event in the slow decline of small towns on the High Plains--the closing of a vital business or key institution. The last meal served in a restaurant, the last gallon of gas sold by a service station, the last class meeting before the school closed, the last car sold by a dealership, the last sale at a grocery store, the last withdrawal at a bank as well as the last movie shown at the theater--all these closings become memorable, if sad, events in the gradual decline of community life. Without groundbreakings, grand openings or other usual markers of growth and progress to celebrate, what else is there to remember? Though the movie was made a third of a century ago and set two decades before that, the depopulation and decline it depicted have continued into the 21st century. However, the abandonment of the High Plains remains an invisible chapter of American history. Most Americans take it for granted that they live in a country of growing populations, ever-sprawling cities and new buildings & malls that appear seemingly overnight. Yet, for those few still living on the High Plains, the vast landscape stretching from west Texas northward into Canada, the conspicuous, everyday reality is that of the last picture show.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game would be a great game if not for the energy issues (refuse to pay real money)  other than that the concept is fun
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Movie is based on a short story which doomed it from the start because we know how much research and effort goes into a short story. A good story takes years to write and rewrite and involves a lot of research. Not in this case. Too many holes not well thought out for a reality based story. I, like many others, bought the movie because of Liam and his face is prominent on the cover. Should have been a wolf - at least you would get to see one.<br />Problems:<br />(1.) The initial scenes of a a bunch of guys drinking and brawling seemed too much like Hollywood script writers copying an old western saloon.<br />(2.) Liam's suicide thoughts were just a distraction and out of place.<br />(3.) The plane crash sequence, which was imaginatively created from the passengers pov turned out to be just cheap filming as all we're shown is a subsequent scene of a partial plane and stuff strewn on snow. And the usual couple of burning fires.<br />(4.) The drunken cowboy stereotypes as survivors continue which under the circumstances didn't seem to fit workers accustomed to working in those difficult conditions.<br />(5.) Usual dumb decisions like not fashioning snow shoes (easy to do from plastic suitcases and webbing; not making weapons from aluminum as defense against predators; not making torches; not gathering more than one lighter; not punching more holes in fuel tanks for kerosene; not using powder from bullets for small explosives; not making aluminum trekking poles. Basically not good planning while not searching for survival materials.<br />(6.) The shotgun shells on sticks seemed to have gotten lost - not that it was explained that well in the first place.<br />(7.) Final scenes of not fashioning a crutch or carrier for the leg injured survivor; being submerged in freezing water and when Liam gets out he's not shivering or hypothermic. Should have been dead, if not while in the water, then soon afterwards.<br />(8.) Not trying to find a path down a small cliff - the wolves seemed to have had no problems.<br />(9.) The behavior and pursuit by the wolves was way over the top - thought I was watching \\"Twilight\\". Their brief momentary cameos in scenes and even the artificially reflective eyes was just cheap cinematography.<br />(9.) River they were following was large to begin with but got progressively smaller. Huh? That's a good trick.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|On the surface, this seems like any other urban fantasy book I've read and loved. But really, it's one of the most unique books I've ever read.<br /><br />And let me just say,  I loved it.<br /><br />Honestly, it was refreshing to read a book in this genre written by a man with a male main character. That almost never happens! At least, not in the circles I tend to stay in.<br /><br />Atticus is a fun dude. I love to listen to him talk. He's very formal in his narration (no contractions, even) but he knows how important speech is to fitting into the community (so that his 2000+ years don't arouse suspicion ) and is able to converse in the vernacular. I love it.<br /><br />Even though Atticus is the main character, he is not my favorite character. My favorite character in the series is his dog Oberon. Yes, you read that right, his dog. As a druid, Atticus has the ability to bind himself to his pet and teach him to talk in his mind. The two converse telepathically. And Oberon is just awesome.<br /><br />He may actually be my all time favorite character ever.<br /><br />Even if you don't think you'll like reading about the last remaining druid in a world where all of the gods of all of the pantheons are (or were) real (not to mention werewolves, vampires, and witches)... read it anyway (well truly, I recommend the audiobook). Oberon makes it worth it.

1933952806|5.0|I've been using a D80 for about four years and am very familiar with all of its controls and menus. Having just bought a D7000 I was struck by its manual having 325 pages compared with the 149 pages in the D80's manual. This led me to buy `Mastering the D7000' by Darrell Young and I'm very glad that I did. The book covers all of the buttons and menus. It's written in a clear language and gives an in depth explanation of everything that you need to know. At the end of each section Darrell Young gives his recommendations for the best settings.<br /><br />When the book arrived, I sat down and started reading it with the D7000 to hand. It took me about a week to read the book and I now think I've got a pretty clear idea as to how to set up and use the camera for my style of photography.<br /><br />The book itself is 479 pages and is printed on good quality paper with excellent photographs of the all the settings and of every menu. One of the things I liked about the book was that he did not pad it out with loads of basic things such as how to remove a lens or charge up the battery. The book assumes the D7000 is not your first DSLR. If it is, however, he gives a link to the publisher's website from where you can access and download 10 different pdf files which provide a wealth of additional information. For example, there is a fifteen page file entitled \\"Understanding Depth of Field, Aperture and Shutter Speed\\"<br /><br />I was very impressed with this book and it is certainly the best camera guide that I've read to date. Highly recommended regardless of the level of your experience with other cameras.
B001HBT0XY|4.0|I am a big fan of the Stereophonics, this CD has all their best tunes from back in the day and bring back memories of the mid 90's and 00's. I think Dakota is my favorite song of theirs. Would definitely recommend this for any Stereophonics fan.

B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is a nice, small, light and versatile flash. It works great for me with my D3100. Its range is limited but only as to be expected but defiantly broadens the ability of the D3100 and improves the picture quality. I have had no issue regarding battery life but I haven't worked it to intensely yet so maybe others are more qualified to comment on that side of things.<br />I am glad I bought it, it was relatively cheap but well made so I am happy all around.
B007BRJYF2|2.0|This game is very simple and repetitive, verging on the boring side. The graphics are ok, but I was expecting more. It seems to be for kids because the objects can be found very easily, and there is also a zoom. Only the first scene is timed and if you can't find the objects within the time you can try again until you do. Not too much variety of objects to find - 30 jars of jam, 15 butterflies, 15 paintings, 59 white roses, 15 hearts, 20 clouds, etc. The mini puzzles in between are extremely easy - solvable within 30 seconds or less, and they are mostly slide puzzles. I finished in less than 2 hours and really took my time, so it is definitely too short. If you want a challenge, this is not it.
B0055EAJ7A|3.0|I liked the other Marvel movies but this one doesn't really mach up, it entertained me but didn't leave me wanting more. The 3D is good, picture and sound were perfect but I think the writing could have been better.<br />Natalie Portman is a nice addition but I don't think this is a role that she will be tremendously proud of, not her fault , more the fault of mediocre writing.<br />I would recommend you rent this movie rather than buy it.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when i started to play. I was quickly drawn into this game. Sure there's a lot of reading , but it doesn't matter. I didn't even notice the hours go by when i played. I just wanted to know all of the story already LOL Some of the endings creeped me out , but i'm sure that's the point. The puzzles were frustrating at first , but then i got the hang of it and solved them easily. I actually feel accomplished i was able to piece everything together. Every other game I've ever played is so easy in comparison. I really hope they make a sequel!

B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these.  I received a pair as a gift about a year and a half ago from a family member who also loved them.  Ear buds are painful to me and don't stay in well. Other headphones don't stay on well while I'm exercising or painfully squash my ears.  These, however, are extremely light weight, comfortable and stay on my head no matter what I'm doing.  The sound quality is amazing and no one else hears my music no matter how loud I have the volume.<br /><br />That being said, they are a bit delicate and don't last forever.  For the last few months I've been carrying these around between home (where I workout) and my office and they've taken a bit of a beating being toted around.  The wire on the left side seems to have come loose and I have to wiggle the wire to get it to work.  I'm ordering two more pairs (one for home and one for the office) to replace my first pair.  I can't find them in the stores but here on Amazon they're pretty inexpensive which makes buying two pairs a bargain.<br /><br />If other headphones haven't worked for you, give these a shot.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play over and over to get a better score.  it can pass the time wherever you are. I love this game!

B000W1V5OC|5.0|Absolutely love this DVD.  I never would have thought I would like a band like Nightwish, but ever since I've watched this concert, I can't get enough of them.  I have had friends over to watch it and they too have been blown away by these great artists.  Me and my son and his new wife have already gotten tickets to see them when they come to our city this late summer.  We can't wait.  In fact, I have ordered a friend a copy of the DVD and the audio CD of \\"End of an Era\\" for myself and future daughter-in-law.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|I am giving this DVD of \\"Georger Harrison: Living In The Material World\\" five stars even though I haven't had the time to watch it yet.  Every one that I have talked to that have purchased this and watched it said it was amazing.  Of all the Beatles, I must admit that I preferred George Harrison over the other three.  Don't get me wrong.  Each member of the Beatles had their own unique personality and style, but I found that George Harrison had a lot of depth to him.  I can't wait until I can sit down and watch the complete DVD without interruption.
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|Using the MarkIII & 16-35 lens.<br />After some work, I could get the Opteka Pro to stay level fine, but I could not get stable motion.  I'm no expert with stabilizers, but I'm handy.  I gave it a couple hours effort, and reviewed videos... I think I gave the Opteka Pro a fair shake.  Thumbs down for me..  (The worst was that the Opteka got a \\"bad attitude\\" while a client waited and watched...  It failed me right then and there...  I've since purchased a different model and the difference was instantly obvious, in touch and feel).

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Taubes' book is one of the most important works I've read on diet, nutrition, and health policy in many, many years. Nutrition 'science' simply isn't science, at least not in the way that scientists consider true scientific knowledge, and the fact that health policy has been based on non-scientific approaches to nutrition irritates me, because the impact of nutrition is so great on both the individual and society.  I came away from this book with two life-altering insights:  1) Do not trust 'received wisdom' about diet and nutrition but read deeply to understand the underlying science before you believe it; and 2) I need to modify the way I approach my own eating.  Highly recommended.

0061692042|5.0|CANADA is - and I don't say this very often - a contemporary masterpiece:  tautly-drawn and introspective characters, elegant themes, terse plotting and symmetrical structure.  It deserves to win Richard Ford another Pulitzer.<br /><br />The oft-quoted first lines (First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later) set the stage for the duality that is showcased heavily throughout CANADA: the robberies, then the murder (reflecting two deceptions)...the past, then the now. Our narrator, Dell Parsons, is a twin; his sister Berner is an emotional opposite.  His parents also, are two sides of a coin:  tall, charming and Southern Bev Parsons and tiny, exotic, northern Neeva.<br /><br />The structure also reflects duality:  Part I and Part II (there is a 20-page Part III, which serves as an epilogue). The first part takes place in Montana; Dell's parents rob a bank to settle a meagerly debt, instantly propelling him into an uncertain future.  Dell was \\"too young and too far outside the boundaries of the little I knew.\\" He is spirited across the border by a family friend and taken in by an enigmatic man named Arthur Remlinger, who hides many dark secrets of his own. And so lays the groundwork for Part II.<br /><br />Crossing this boundary - from the United States to Canada - is far more than geographic.  CANADA is not so much about the country as it is a state of mind.  \\"Why the change of weather and light produced a change in me and made me more accepting - more than the awareness of time passing - I can't say,\\" reflects Dell.  Canada is an interior landscape where internal growth is realized.  This is reinforced when Remlinger's shady associate gives him this guidance: \\"Charley Quarters had told me you crossed borders to escape things and possibly to hide, and Canada in his view was a good place or that...But it also meant you became someone different in the process...'<br /><br />As in previous works, Richard Ford is most intrigued by the \\"what used to be\\" and the \\"now. What happens when you cross that boundary from the past to the present or, more precisely, the boundary of what you were to what you are becoming?  What is the moment when you become different in the process?  Does crossing an interior frontier change anything and does it give us the right to a second chance?  Can we, indeed, develop from a way of living that doesn't work toward one that does?<br /><br />CANADA keeps circling back onto itself and eventually, we the readers come to identify the lines that are crossed that disallow us from ever coming back.  This is a magnificent book that rewards the reader on every turn.most intrigued by the \\"what used to be\\" and the \\"now.

0786182466|5.0|I've heard about rave reviews of this book for years.  I got the audio version because I love to listen to books while commuting to work on bus/subway and also at the gym.  The book is peopled by the most unique fully 3-dimensional characters you will ever know.  And above all -- Ignatius Reilly is truly one of the most unique characters I have come across in the English language.  A highly educated lazy man who is pure ego lives with his mother, can't hold down a job, yet seeks ways to take progressive stands in his own bizarre fashion.
0345472322|5.0|My entire department read and discussed this book.  It provides common language and understanding during a time of transition and budget cuts in which we can remind each other to approach our dilemmas with a Flexible mindset, seeking creative solutions.  For those who already employ this type of thinking, the book gives validation; for others, valuable insight.  Enjoyable and creative reading.
B00498TQV8|5.0|Great movie!  Gripping, dark, beautiful.  Ensemble cast is amazing and Jennifer Lawrence is a force.  A beautiful encapsulation of the strength, will, courage, and triumph of the human spirit that flourishes even in the ground of humanities darker expressions.

B007SGM084|5.0|Great story line that keeps the pages turning and just enough romance and intimacy to complete the package. Loved the whole series.
B0086700CM|5.0|my family and I love that you made the game because I was hoping that you were going the make it like apple
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. its awesome and I love it. every half hour I'm checking on it. just wish stuff was cheaper and the acorns came easier. I also need some neighbors.......any one wanna help? also the property the more you buy the more expensive it is.....what's up with that its all the same size.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Firefly is a geat show. Serenity is a fitting and awesome conclusion to this story. 1st the characters/actors are awesome. Each actor has had or currently owns a major role in a television/movie. Nathon Fillion is the main character he is currently on the show Castle. Kalee, Jewel Staite, was also on the show Stargate Atlantis for a awhile. Also, lets not forget Joss Whedon himself, if you liked the new Avenger's movie then you should like this show for they are both his work. My point is the cast is strong, so the comments on bad writing and acting is unfounded. As for the Western aspect of the movie, well in the show they didn't just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of Chinese heritage. Lastly, after this show was cancelled, unjustly, this show had a \\"HUGE\\" fan base. So much so that Joss Whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did. The Full length film finishing the Firefly series is called \\"Serenity\\" and currently holds a 4 1/2 star rating here on Amazon out of 1800 + reviews and was rated a 7.9 on IMDB out of 143,000 people.<br /><br />Let me explain the Western aspect and the Chinese influence to this show for those people who might find merrit in this argument. Joss Whedon doesn't just come out and say it in this show he wants the viewer to watch and come to their own understanding of why modern society in Firely has a Chinese and old western style to it. Most of Frefly's fans understand it but for those who don't let me explain...nerd moment beware....<br /><br />In this show Earth is no more or if there are people still on it, its a LOOOONG ways away. The Alliance is the major power in Firefly, from what I understand the Allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the Earth's western powers(United States/Great Britain) and China. When they settled on their new worlds they formed an Alliance. This is why you see and hear people in Firefly wearing chinese clothing and speaking Chinese while still using English as their base language. Inara, who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a Chinese or oriental style to it. Lastly the western feel to the story, Joss Whedon actually explained this in the show better then the Chinese part alot better, you just have to pay attention. In the Pilot episode they clearly state that after the Alliance TERRAFORMS a world they throw settlers on them with almost no resources and a few small herds and minor supplies. This is why the show has a Western Feel to it, the inner Alliance Core worlds are the Metropolitan mega cities you might be expecting in a Sci-fi show which appear later in the series while the outer rim worlds have the desolate wild west aspect. That is the story plot for the western feel to the story. However, I suspect budget played into this part aswell. Almost every TV show out there costs several million dollars just to air one episode, so the production costs of creating a futuristic city in every episode or space battles and what not probably would be to costly from a producers stand point. The movie Serenity makes up for the lack of production restraints in Firefly and spares no expense when it comes to CGI effects and scenery.

B0006GANOQ|3.0|This is an excellent thriller. Except for the last 20 minutes, the logic is generally ok (though why does one cop deliberately shoot another?). The camera work is good (not too much blurring and shaking of the camera). The characters are likable. Great stunts. Quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The last 20 minutes nearly ruin the whole thing. The plot becomes illogical and absurd. That's where the movie lost a star on my ratings.
B007ZEC1GU|5.0|This is not Nora's best album,but its a clear winner and very much a part of her evolution to a mature artist. I think she is carrying too many sidemen-diluting her singular talent- and I am very tired of productions where percussion dominates the arrangement. The album is enjoyable,and well worth the price.
B007XH6BPG|3.0|Well, sometimes such a different music project works so well, by means of this strange collaboration between  a lively and \\"fertile\\" musician like Chris Squire from Yes and the legendary guitarist.<br /><br />Recently Steve has been a guest star in a \\"Christmas\\" album by Chris Squire...my feeling for this Duo is growing after a repeated listening and moreover some good tunes such as \\"Perfect Love Song\\", \\"Divided Self\\" or \\"The Summer Backwards\\" are not bad, being indicated by someone as a good compromise; but for me- probably- the title track better represents  the experiment by this super Duo: helped by the Roger King's keyboards, following the progression of the rythmical pattern and enriching the guitar lines in the best manner, Steve and Chris are perfectly fitted into this new music project!! Think of the easy harmony by the orchestrations, supporting the same rythmical section even in the simple structure in 4/4 : well it's a good idea and nevermind if the vocal parts are not remarkable, in spite of the interesting melodies.<br />Anyway I confirm the effectiveness of their lyrics and at the end the old fans but also the new listeners can appreciate the intelligent effort by these famous British musicians!! Ok generally it's a \\"shrewd\\" partnership, sometimes a little bit resembling  the \\"mainstream\\" rock of a kind nowadays, but it's quite personal and original too after all.<br /><br />Even though please forget the prog epics here:  for example I think that the track \\"Tall Ships\\", the second one, despite of reducing the pathos and resembling the Zeppeling mood too much, is original in the effects and harmony by Steve, well supported by the rhytmical bass pattern by Chris, quite \\"funky\\" (what a good idea!!), but I cannot regard it as a \\"prog\\" tune...Anyway a mature ensemble They are, able to create something different in comparison to their typical quality standard that you can recognize inside their solo music projects.<br />Unfortunately it's difficult to \\"label\\" this music as \\"progressive music\\", also regarding of the homogeneous nine tracks from the beginning to the end...but nevermind, my evaluation is \\"three stars and an half\\" and the whole album is quite recommended as well, after all!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have this game on my Kindle Fire.  Never had a problem with performance.  Love this game!  I couldn't put it down when I first got it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|So far, this is the best of the Sherwood Baptist movies. While this does not have a counterpart to Kirk Cameron's star power, I feel the quality of the acting across the board is stronger.<br /><br />Like the other movies, this blends comedy and drama, and as Fireproof had some edge of the seat scenes, including the opening sequence. This is more of a drama than an action/adventure film, but that doesn't mean action is lacking.<br /><br />One decision I'd question is the emphasis on the Javier role. On the plus side, he adds a lot to the movie -- he helps make the movie. On the down side, his inclusion focuses the movie on the theme of male responsibility and takes the focus off the setting of police officers.<br /><br />The cover gives you the impression this is an ensemble movie, and to some point it is. But the focus is on Adam Mitchell, played by director Alex Kendrick (who also had the starring role in Flywheel and Facing the Giants).<br /><br />A final technical point. The construction of the story, especially at the end, can give it an appearance of being preachy. This film, as with the others by Sherwood Baptist, are theme dominated, with a message to communicate. The others have a better job in the ending of not being as preachy, with pictures instead of words being the final point.<br /><br />Yes, this movie has a very strong Christian worldview. If you're not tolerant of this worldview, you won't like this film.

This is how the story goes: A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a thrilling journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race.<br /><br />The cast led by Noomi Rapace (as Elizabeth Shaw) & Michael Fassbender (as David) is excellent. The directing by Ridley Scott (who also produced) is excellent. The story & screenplay by Jon Spaihts & Damon Lindelof (who also executive produced) is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Marc Streitenfeld is excellent. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is excellent. The film editing by Pietro Scalia is excellent. The casting by Avy Kaufman & Nina Gold is excellent. The production design by Arthur Max is excellent. The art direction by Alex Cameron, Anthony Caron-Delion, Peter Dorme, Marc Homes (senior art director), Paul Inglis, John King (supervising art director), Adam O'Neill & Karen Wakefield (senior art director) is excellent. The set decoration by Sonja Klaus is excellent. The costume design by Janty Yates is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Rob Inch & Stuart Clark is excellent. The special make-up by Jo Grover & Josh Weston, prosthetic make-up by Valter Casotto, Susie O'Sullivan, Valentina Visintin, Áslaug Dröfn Sigurðardóttir & prosthetic effects supervised by Conor O'Sullivan is excellent. The creature effects coordinated by Katie Newitt & Phill Woodfine & design by Waldo Mason is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Vanessa Armitage (vfx production coordinator), Charise E. Angone, Jignesh Mehta, Brendan Savage, Jack George, Jane Kyung Lee, Issac Lipstadt, Lara Lom, Abigail Mendoza & Matthew Sakata & supervised by Richard Stammers, Everett Burrell, Paul Butterworth, Vincent Cirelli, Trent Claus, Dick Edwards, Charley Henley, Martin Hill & Edson Williams is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent sci-fi film that keeps you thinking and entertained as well. It is also a well-crafted, well-made film that is conceptually different than other sci-fi films of its kind. Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi after 30 years is impressive, another excellent film for him, as well. Noomi Rapace & Michael Fassbender lead a well-rounded cast of characters. This is also one of the best movies of the year and of the summer, so far.

The writing is excellent and the story completely engrossing. Stayed up way too late many a night reading... Can't wait for further books in this series!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is well worth your time to at least read the first edition. The prose and grammar are excellent and I learned words I was not familiar with. The description of various places, actions and people kept me reading on. This is a great read! Bravo to the author for giving me a great love story.<br /><br />I sent a friend the first book for Xmas. She called me sooo many times to discuss and beg for the next two books (she is on a very small income and has no technologies). I finally gave in and am waiting for a call
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Actually a very good movie; well acted with exciting visual effects.  Not sure why it bombed so badly.  I can only guess Disney did not know how to promote it.  The title did not say anything so maybe that was the problem.  Not really a Disney movie.  The start was a bit slow and probably could be cut by 20 minutes to speed it up.  However, love this scifi genre and this was on the top notch of this type of film.  The ending seemed fairly complete so maybe a sequel is not needed.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Overall I enjoyed the book. i had no idea that this was fanfiction. i had to kep reading to see what fifty would do next
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|it is an amazing app but sometimes it won't load. It has just as much stuff ss it could, but I wish there weren't ads.
0345803485|5.0|Granted I was a bit wary of this book once it came out.  I tend to disregard everything and everyone when they say \\"you must read this book because...\\" I begrudgingly waited until I found a cheaper copy, something that i knew that i could donate if i didn't like it.  and then I sat down to read.  The story was just like out of a fairy tale.  A young woman plucked out of obscurity by a richer man. Then came the love and the sex.  The sex! many people argued that the S&M aspect was too much that it detracted from the over all story, but...<br />I have to say that this was not true.  Grey is controlling, because that's all he knows, Ana is a newb to S&M, ready to be trained.  Wonderful, wonderful love story with just a hint of sexuality and depravity.
B000002LIX|5.0|To call this album an absolute classic and then say that I like their other album \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" even more, says a lot.<br /><br />Putting aside this band's tumultuous legacy, let me just say this...<br /><br />If you are a fan of guitars, this band is for you. Dave Navarro is ridiculously creative and to my mind underrated in the rock world. You can't disregard the fact that he's one of the sexiest guitarists ever, either.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the bass, this band is for you. Eric Avery and Perry Farrell put these songs together. This isn't music, it's art, and Avery is an artist. Though several extremely able bassists have covered for him in the years since (LeNoble, Flea, McKagan, and, usually, Chaney), diehard fans certainly do miss Avery and for good reason. His sounds throb, ebb and flow, and create the perfect bedrock for the insanity that goes on up top.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the drums, this band is for you. Stephen Perkins is my favorite drummer of all time, and arguably the reason so many people are hooked on the Jane's sound. He was laying down mathematically-perfect, almost electronic-sounding beats long before electronica was popular, and he utilizes a batman utility-belt kaleidoscope of percussive options in everything he does. This man loves drums, and he is a master of them. The Jane's beat is as unique as the band is itself. Tribal tribal tribal.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the frontman, this band is for you. Perry Farrell does not act insane, he is insane. He doesn't act like a neo-shaman, he is a neo-shaman. He doesn't act like a guru, he is a guru. With a screaming/singing voice that hearkens images of kindergartners on acid, Farrell is pure cyclone on-stage, and this is as true of the 1980's Farrell as it is of the 2010+ Farrell. Clearly one of the most unique singers in all of rock, ever, his sound and style has been replicated, duplicated, copied, and borrowed in the decades since, but no one comes close. He is always connected to his audience, and he is always pure, living, banshee energy.<br /><br />Anyone can find something about this band to love, and in 2012, having attended two shows, I can say that they are very much alive and well. I heard comments by young kids coming out of the last show \\"I always wanted to see Led Zeppelin live, this is as close as I'm going to get today\\" and \\"Holy...! I've got to get their albums\\". They are making new fans even now.<br /><br />Start with Nothing's Shocking, move into Ritual de lo Habitual, try out the live sound of the self-titled release, then progress through Kettle Whistle, Cabinet of Curiosities, Strays, and The Great Escape Artist. It's a rock solid collection, and it is very likely that you too will become an addict.

044024630X|1.0|The murder scene in the middle of the book bears a surprising resemblance to the Trevor Martin case. In this case, Reacher captures three vigilantes in the woods who are guarding a fictional army base in Mississippi. The vigilantes have shot two people approaching the base already, the second being the black teenage brother of one of three girls in town who were murdered. By coincidence, of course, Reacher had interviewed the teenager the day before. One of the three vigilantes admits that he shot the teenager, although claiming it looked like he had a gun. So Reacher, as a warning device to the other vigilantes, raises his gun and then pulls the trigger of the gun that, by coincidence, the female sheriff had given him and to quote the book, \\"The runt's head blew apart and wet-slapped the leaves behind him, and went down vertically, his skinny butt to his heels....\\" Understandably, the other two vigilantes leave and tell their counterparts they better get out and Reacher returns to the waiting sheriff's car and returns her gun and instead of mentioning that he just murdered a man, he tells her that the man committed suicide.<br /><br />Very believable and highly moral? Not in my book. And, of course, the beautiful female sheriff believes him and they drive back to town and have another cheeseburger in the restaurant where they are often the only patrons. That's where I stopped reading and will never read a Lee Child book again. Unless the laws have changed in the United States, Jack Reacher just committed cold-blooded murder, but I suspect that the other half of the book does not find him convicted of first-degree murder and spending the rest of his life in jail, as he should.<br /><br />Another possible title for the book might be: \\"The Coincidence.\\" I could hardly believe the number of unbelievable scenes in first half of the book. A third possible title might have been: \\"Superman Visits Mississippi.\\" In less time than it took me to write the last sentence, Jack Reacher dispensed with six, yes six, full grown hillbilly punks that he thought might be threatening him and no one landed a single blow on him. And, by coincidence, of course, his bed buddy, the local beautiful female sheriff, was standing watching all of this from her balcony on the dingy motel where they are the only two guests. Give me a break! And naturally, even though Reacher committed assault and battery on six people, the beautiful sheriff doesn't take any action against him. We are also expected to believe that a man who traveled from Washington to Mississippi with only a toothbrush, (no change of any clothes) and then runs into two local toughs who smelled like \\"beer, rancid sweat, and dirty clothes\\" doesn't also smell just as bad.<br /><br />The Onondaga County library system (Syracuse NY) now has electronic books you can borrow. But not many yet. John Grisham's one book had 27 people on the waiting list, but then I found this book that had no waiting list. I have never read Lee Childs before and after reading about the cold-blooded murder Jack Reacher commits in the middle of the book, I will never read another. I'm new to the electronic lending method, and so I couldn't immediately find the delete or return button, but it automatically vanishes after two weeks.eacher dispensed with six, yes six, full grown hillbilly punks that he thought might be threatening him and no one landed a single blow on him.

160094048X|5.0|I'm an experienced baker, but vegan novice who loves her sweet baked goods. I was looking for a cookbook that applied vegan technique to quality recipes and this is it! I've baked three cookies from the book so far (Banana Oatmeal Breakfast Cookies, Kitchen Sink Chocolate Biscotti and For the Love of Fruitcake Bars) and each one tasted mildly sweet, fresh and absolutely delicious. Can't wait to stock my pantry and try loads more. The introductory section on \\"Cookie Science\\" with needed ingredients, substitutions, tools for success and troubleshooting is so helpful, and the recipe directions are super clear, if sometimes detailed (some of the cookies have more steps than others, but from the pictures, produce very sophisticated results). I started with bar and drop cookies as they're easier, but will quickly graduate to the vegan Samoas and NYC Black and White Cookies! Every type and mood of cookie is represented, and the recipes can take modification (I reduced the oil from 1/2 c. to 1/3 c. in two recipes, for instance) without much change in quality, which is the sign of a great base recipe. If you're a sweet-loving vegan, or just trying to reduce consumption of egg and dairy, I highly recommend this cookbook.
0547258305|5.0|Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: Excellent journey set in a fascinating fantasy world. The story kept me hooked to the very end.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: In these dungeons the darkness was complete, but Katsa had a map in her mind.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Katsa is a Graceling, someone who is graced with a strange ability but marked by their two different colored eyes. Katsa is graced with extraordinary fighting power that allows Katsa to kill people very easily. King Randa of the Middluns, who also happens to be her uncle, uses her to threaten and kill his enemies as needed but Katsa is a part of an underground Council that is rebelling against unjust Kings.<br /><br />Graceling starts off with Katsa rescuing an old man from a dungeon by orders from the Council. She has no idea why he has been kidnapped but she wants to make sure that whatever plan the man has been kidnapped for will not happen. Prince Tealiff is the father of a King and he has given up all rights over his rule so he wouldn't be worth much as a ransom. As Katsa is leaving, she is surprised by a strange man who wants to know what she is doing at the dungeon. He lets her leave but not before she knocks him out.<br /><br />Katsa eventually returns home after threatening a lord for King Randa. Eventually Prince Po of Lienid shows up at King Randa's castle looking for Katsa and his grandfather, Prince Tealiff. Prince Po is the strange man that surprised her back at the dungeon. She is intrigued by him and his strength as Po is graced with superior fighting skill. She is able to spar with him without worrying too much about accidentally killing him.<br /><br />Katsa realizes that King Randa doesn't hold the power over her that she thought. She rebels from his authority and when she is expelled from the kingdom, she travels with Po to uncover the truth of why his grandfather is kidnapped. Po believes the answers lay in the kingdom on Monsea with Aunt Ashen the Queen of Monsea. Po and Katsa undergo a long journey filled with danger and heartache. Po and Katsa learn more about themselves then they thought possible and their graces are actually more advanced than they knew.<br /><br />The plot begins with the mystery of why Prince Tealiff was kidnapped and evolves into a greater deception by a King. Graceling is action packed from beginning to end and the tension kept me hooked. This is very much a dark story with a girl who can kill without much of a thought and a psycho king who has no problem taking advantage of people.<br /><br />Katsa is a strong character but she does have some flaws. Overall, I liked how she reacted and lived with her grace. I do think her idea of independence is way out there and she is a little whiney about marriage and kids but I think Po is her perfect match and she doesn't really realize what she has with him. I will say that since this is a young adult book that their sex scene was the most non-graphic sensual sex scene I think I have read in a book. I loved Po, he is strong, sarcastic and realistic about who he is even if he has to hide it from people. His silver and gold eyes are to die for.<br /><br />The world of Graceling is at times scary, freighting and fun. If you are a Graceling you are the king's property until your powers develop. If you have a power helpful to the crown you stay the property of the king but if your power is useless you can go back to a normal life. The other countries are explained in detail but it was the travel through the land that made the Seven Kingdoms a magical place.<br /><br />Graceling is a provocative and amazingly crafted fantasy. I have added Kristin Cashore to my must read list and can't wait to see what is in store next.<br /><br />The Graceling Realm Series:<br /><br />1. Graceling<br /><br />2. Fire<br /><br />3. Bitterblue<br /><br />FTC Advisory: I purchased my own copy of Graceling. No goody bags, sponsorships, \\"material connections,\\" or bribes wereexchanged for my review.exchanged for my review.

B0051OJG4Q|5.0|I really enjoy Julie London. However, the quality of the recordings were poor. The plastic case was damaged severely.<br />I think this was a prior return and they repaclaged it and sold it to me.

0061673730|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was seventeen years old (circa 1991) and it truly changed the way I saw the world around me. I became a less angry and more understanding person because of it. Although, it didn't make me fall in love with working on engines-- I still hate doing that.<br />Recently, I re-read it because it had been so long that I'd forgotten many details about the book. It blew me away all over again.<br />Anyone with a real curiosity about the meeting of Eastern and Western philosophy should read this book.
B007N85ZXY|1.0|Neil Young has been my favorite artist for 40 years, and I love the fact that he regularly changes up his musical style.  It's what makes his music fresh, new, and interesting.  This CD is Young's interpretation of some classic old songs (written by others) including \\"This land is your land\\" and \\"Gallows Pole\\".  I think Neil and Crazy Horse missed the boat on this one.  The arrangements are silly and lame.  The background vocals are just awful.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun once in a while but controls suck and you don't get all the games. you have to earn points before getting new games.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I had actually never read anything by Sylvia Day before this book, so I was a little shocked to find out how much I liked it.<br /><br />Everyone is going to compare this to Fifty Shades of Grey, but after you wrap your mind around the dominate male (doesn't every romance novel have one?) and a semi-submissive female (doesn't EVERY romance novel have one?), to me, that is where the resemblance stopped.  It was an enjoyable read... you quickly fall in love with the characters, and find yourself rooting for each of them.  I liked the fact that EVERY character in the novel was flawed somehow, and not lying to themselves about it.  There was none of that \\"I'm trying to find myself\\" ridiculous... these characters had real issues, real therapists, and real repercussions. (Sigh) What a great change of pace...<br /><br />This first novel of the series is the beginning of what is obviously a relationship on the learning curve for Gideon and Eva.  They're both dealing with serious family issues, and trying to maneuver through their instant and erotic attraction to each other into a relationship that neither one really knows how to deal with.  They are both victims of abuse, trying to recover from their own issues in order to cope with each others.  Not the healthiest relationship (for sure), but who's is? Hahaha<br />You find yourself intrigued by the secondary characters in this book, and Ms. Day makes sure she leaves JUST enough unsaid that you'll be waiting for the second installment (due out October 2012).<br /><br />I enjoyed that there wasn't a lot of \\"why am I feeling this way?\\"  and filled with \\"please save me from myself!\\"  The characters recognize their own personal issues, address them, and try to function through them, not around them.  You will find yourself rooting for Eva and Gideon, and quickly falling in love with them.<br /><br />Have a great read!!

B001FSDOZO|3.0|Nickelback is a band that is neither anything resembling great, nor anywhere near as bad as people seem to portray them as. Their music is repetitive, simplistic, and just not very original. But looking back on it, this is exactly what made some of the biggest bands in the world big - what they had wasn't broke so they never fixed it. Nickelback's music is fun in the right doses, and I personally like this album best out of any of their others. Personally, I'd say the main reason for that is the presence of R.J. \\"Mutt\\" Lange having a hand in the production and co-writing about half the songs. His touch on it is noticeable - ballads on the record such as the standout and minor hit \\"Never Gonna Be Alone\\" heavily recall Bryan Adams, for whom he helped write some massive hit ballads. Other ballads include the infectious pop-rock of \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\" (thus far their last top 10 hit), the laid back country vibe of \\"This Afternoon\\" (thus far their last top 40 hit) and \\"I'd Come For You,\\" and the somewhat re-tread material of \\"If Today Was Your Last Day.\\" The harder-rocking tracks fall somewhere in between the balls-out approach of his work with AC/DC and the glossy approach of his work with Def Leppard - more muscle than the latter but not as natural-sounding as the former. \\"Burn It To The Ground\\" bears resemblance to a much lower-key version of an AC/DC number, while \\"Shakin' Hands\\" would fit in on Hysteria. The remainder of the rockers - \\"Something In Your Mouth,\\" \\"Next Go Round,\\" \\"Just To Get High\\" and \\"S.E.X.\\" - don't offer too much that the listener hasn't heard from these guys, but they get the job done. I'm not giving this a bad review like so many people love to do simply because of the fact that, well, it's Nickelback. I'm gonna say that they're okay, and that this is probably the best full-on album they've put out to date. Don't run out and buy it necessarily, that's all well and good. But man, I just got bored of hating on em, and this is pretty much why.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|Are you tired of music with no melodies, poor harmonies, poor songwriting?  No matter how old you are please do yourself a favor and buy this record!  You will hear arrangements vocally and instrumentally that you unlike you never heard before, unless you purchased \\"Beach Boys Music\\" in 60's & 70' and early 80's.  These guys are now all in there 70's and they sound better that 99.9 % of the groups out there!  These songs bring back memories, excitement, soul, and meaning!  From the very first song to the last this is a great album....I really wish they would have added Glen Campbell as as session player and make it a full blown reunion! But, hey this is as good as it gets!  Do yourself a favor and buy this record, you will not regret it, plus they are selling it for a great price!  THE BEACH BOYS ARE AMERICAS GREATEST AMERICAN ROCK BAND OF ALL TIME! Brian the GENIUS, Mike Love the lyricist, and commander on stage, Al Jardine the incredible Singer & Guitar Player, David Marks \\"The pioneer of real SURF GUITAR \\"Yes the Grunge Rockers stole from DAVID MARKS, Bruce Johnstone \\" The Soft Hearted Soul & Grammy award winning Songwriter\\" example \\"I Write The Songs & Disney Girl\\" the new edition the Tenor Jeffery Foskett has a excellent performance on these songs as well!<br /><br />AND THIS IS WHY GOD MADE THE BEACH BOYS \\"To bring joy & Soul to the empty gap in Music for the rest of Time\\"!

0142405809|5.0|This is a great book and I love reading it to my daughter over and over. She is an animal lover so it was a no brainer when I saw this book to buy, especially with the great reviews. It has a great story line, and I would recommend buying it!
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Awesome docu-drama about Pearl Harbor. Watching this with a World War 2 Navy Veteran who served at Pearl shortly after the attack and heard from many survivors their stories, this is a very accurate depiction of the attack.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|For the price of this item it can't be beat.  I've baton cut with it and it did great, remained sharp.  The grind it has on it makes it tough and excellent for bushcraft.  I had no issues trying to start a fire with a ferro rod and this knife.  The sheath is just like the one for the Buck hoodlum knife, it's multi purpose, has molle straps on the back so it can be carried in different positions, and the pocket in the front is perfect to carry a multi tool. The knife has some weight to it, but it's a knife piece of gear to have in the bush.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|...but this one was done well.  I bought this book because of all the media hype.  Although, I thought the sex was overused, I found my analytical self zeroing in on the relationship of the two main characters.  Each of us is a sum of our experiences.  That is brought out quite well in this novel. Ana tries to 'get to know' Christian's past experiences, but he won't let her in.  He expects her to trust him, but he can't put his trust in her despite the things she has done for him.  She handles it the only way she can, she doesn't compromise who she is.  I'm looking forward to reading book 2 to see if Christian will share his experiences openly with Ana.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie primarily because we are fans of the work of Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock. But imagine our surprise when the actor who stole the show was none other than the young man in his feature film debut, Thomas Horn. You could feel all the emotion of a heartbroken kid who missed his daddy after losing him on \\"The Worst Day\\"--September 11, 2001. After the movie was over, my wife said, \\"Can we watch a comedy now because I'm thoroughly depressed?\\" HA! Yep, it ain't a fluff movie and it's heavy on the heart. But what an amazing story told through the eyes of a child.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This movie was really quite funny. I have only seen the English version with Matthew MacFadyen but I can tell you that one reason it is so funny is because the people are English and they have a wonderful sense of humor and way of expressing same.

B0002NRQTS|5.0|What was so refreshing about this album upon release was the lack of synthesizers, this is not a complaint however; Signals through to Hold Your Fire is one of the most exciting phases of Rush's career but I think it came full circle with the breathtaking beauty of Hold Your Fire. Rush had simply taken this style of their music to the end of its cycle.<br /><br />The Pass and Presto perfectly showcased the new sound of Rush with the latter track featuring acoustic guitars aplenty and one of Lifeson's most simple, yet effective solos to date. Indeed Lifeson's guitar work as a whole enjoyed a healthy step towards the forefront of the Rush sound.<br /><br />Presto stands alongside Counterparts as one of the landmarks of Rush in the 90's. Counterparts further developing the musical themes of electric and acoustic (guitars and percussion) sounds combined.<br /><br />Lyrically, we can see some of Peart's most poetic efforts, the best of which can be found within Chain Lightning and The Pass. The magic of Presto lies in the midnight winter atmosphere it evokes and the finely air brushed production helps shape and define these cool, diamond like songs.<br /><br />On a final note, Presto contains a few of their best compositions, via The Pass (a beautiful, understated guitar piece in the middle section) and Available Light, which has another brilliant Lifeson solo; a lonely, haunted, twisting sound that mirrors the lyrics perfectly. It is a strange album but that is simply another reason for me to love it. Is it a cold album? It is clinical - but it holds an icy beauty, like glistening snow at midnight.
1400069289|3.0|I can see why someone may give this book 5 stars and would not argue.<br /><br />The Power of Habit is more about the history of habit research than about habits, forming, breaking or changing them. It tells many interesting stories. I have become somewhat tired of books like this that have hundreds of pages of stories when what I am interested in can be reduced to five or six pages. Don't get me wrong, I use to really enjoy the stories and if you do you will probably like this book. I found myself wanting some clear, concise information and never really got it.<br /><br />Others have criticized this book for having too much filler. I would not. Instead I would suggest one know what they want to fill the book. Remember, the author is a reporter. He is not really an expert on habits but he reports about them in an interesting way. There is usable information inside, for me it was more work to get at than I wanted.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm loving the game. It will keep you entertained for hours. I remember it as a little girl and this is so much better.
B0013ND30W|3.0|For those not familiar with how Blu-rays work, they have what is called a \\"pop-up\\" menu which is a menu that you can bring up without exiting the movie.  Sometimes though, the pop-up menu and other features don't work as they should and in this case the pop-up menu doesn't always come up when I hit the button, and it requires bringing up the \\"top menu\\" which is like the menu on a standard DVD. But every time I do this, it goes back to the beginning of the movie and I have to navigate back to where I was and there are also loading screens between the menu and the movie.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this game is so fun! i like it a lot. i can edit my pics to make them look really awesome and then i can post it.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Well done! YS has been on my blu-ray \\"want list\\" or a long time. The film itself looks and sound great.<br />I find the judder when panning to be an eyesore, but this is something that is inherent in the frame rate. It's just particularly noticeable on a cartoon.<br />The on-camera interviews (in the extras) are surprisingly brief; literally one or two sentences. I don't find some of the extras to be particularly interesting, but this is a great presentation of an innovative animated feature.<br />George Martin's score is terrific, and I still love the Eleanor Rigby segment the best. The Nowhere Man character still cracks me up; great voice work.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This film is a classic of the genre and a good example of the work of Norma Shearer in sound films.The transfer is a good one.I have seen this film many times.I can never tire of the snappy dialog and facial expressions of the actresses.Well worth the purchase price.
B00783NWB6|5.0|Great story line and great action. A must have for any fan of the series. Kate beckinsdale sizzles!. 3d version enhances what's already great.
B004RDXOUY|5.0|It was hard to find this movie and they don't play it anymore on TV because it's not \\"pc,\\" also that's why it's so good.  Very good.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is the worst game ever even though I gave it a five star it sucks don't play it it suuuuuuuuuucks l
B00338QENI|5.0|I enjoyed the way these facts were brought to life.  The reader learns a lot more than expected.  Too bad this is not required reading for young people.  They would learn and understand more of the social values in place during the era of Henrietta.  I developed a greater appreciation for the contributions of African Americans to the development of the modern cellular science.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting forever and now it's here!!!<br />I just love this game!!!<br />I could play it all day ;)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I never write book reviews, but I feel like I really need to help bring the average rating of this book down. I couldn't even finish it. Thankfully, Amazon has a wonderful return policy for Kindle Books and I got my money back after not even getting through a third of the book.<br /><br />I'll say up-front that I'm very openminded and had high hopes for this book. I wanted to like it. The only thing that kept me reading as far as I did was similar to what keeps you staring at a car wreck long after you want to look away. James has twenty-somthings saying \\"I'll see you this evening\\" to each other. They're 20, not 50. Then there was this gem: Regarding being a misfit, \\"I have never fitted in anywhere.\\" Um, who let that get through editing? By far my favorite line in what I managed to get through was \\"He's my very own Christian Grey-flavored popsicle.\\" Again, I'm openminded, but please, really? Aside from issues with the writing itself, the plot seemed ok at best. Innocent virgin meets way-too-young-to-be-realistic billionaire who wants to take her as his sex slave. That's as far as I got, plus two and a half sex scenes. (Yes, I left in the middle of a sex scene; it's that bad.) I know it's fiction, but come on. If it's based in the here and now, it has to be at least somewhat believable. And a virgin's first orgasm being form nipple-play? Really? If only it were that easy.<br /><br />Part of me wishes I had kept reading. Mostly because that part of me is curious to see how much worse the book could get and wants to continue making fun of it. (This is the same part of me that wants to watch the Twilight series, just to see how bad it really is.) The stronger, smarter part of me realizes I have a long list of good books to read this summer and has convinced me to not waste my time with E. L. James's piece of crap. Best-seller my ass! (Can I say that on here?)<br /><br />Save yourself the time, money and disappointment, and don't read this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game rocks the world don't get it if your afraid of cool monkeys. totally. get this you will love it. its awesome
B007NKLUV8|3.0|This CD I have been looking forward too for a very long time.<br /><br />The problem is that if you pre-ordered it well in advance you has to pay over $22 for the disc. Normally I wouldn't quibble about it but after I order they post another version for $14. Contrary to Amazon policy I did not get it for the lowest price. So Amazon, live up to your promises.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The Beach Boys have evidently tapped in to a fountain of youth,as this album proves.<br />On reflection,It serves as a concept album as its undercurrents continue to define their trademark sound while presenting elements of their entire career as they have progressed.<br />After 50 years,Its an amazing thing to hear those harmonies as they flow hypnotically from these guys.<br />Of course,no Beach Boys album would be complete without some goofiness, and the self- serving 'Spring Vacation' is certainly up to the task here,despite a very nice guitar solo which almost saves it.<br />The rest of the album,especially 'That's Why God Made The Radio',' 'Summer's Gone', 'Shelter',\\"Strange World\\" and Daybreak Over The Ocean' remind us<br />that no one on  the planet can sing like The Beach Boys,and this album is an essential addition to their body of work.<br />Impossibly beautiful and sure to bring a smile to the longtime fan as well as the novice listener.<br /> After repeated listenings,I have edited this review to adjust my attitude towards \\"Spring Vacation\\" I can't get the song out of my head.Make this one a 5 star!<br />The rest of this treasure of an album is a magical gift ,and as for most gifts,the best ones in life are the unexpected ones.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|I must admit that this is not the usual type of book I read.  However, I really enjoyed the storyline.  It gave an insight into the taking of drugs and the rehabilitation needed to stop using.  All in all a good read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|very simple to use. and easy to read and navigate. I recomend this app for anyone. a great extended forecast.
0345803493|5.0|I have heard this trilogy referred to a \\"mommy porn\\" but I would not go that far. It is tastefully written erotica within a good story line. I am in the middle of Book Two. Both of my daughters (in their mid-20's) referred me to this series. Enjoy!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this a great app that I use daily on my Asus Transformer Prime. its a bit laggy when used with heavily formula loaded sheets.  hope they look at it and then this app would be PERFECT.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the greatest apps that I have ever Seen!  Imagine having the entire Bible in electronic form. I love the ability to look up any verse. Bookmark and highlight just as if it was a physical book. I downloaded the kjv to use online.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I tried the free version first and loved it, so when it expired...I found myself looking for another free app...Well, there is no other app that came close..so I just purchased this one..pay the money..it's the best app out there!!!
B002PEP4C8|4.0|This book was not always easy to read. The detailed description of the crime was extremely hard to take. However, I found the reaction of her family and friends, as well as the healing process the author went through to be very inspiring.
0345803485|1.0|Don't even borrow it.  I bought it at an airport bookstore on  a long layover, read the first 50 pages (coincidence), and promptly returned it.  Didn't even make it to a sex scene.  Flat, uninspired, monotonous, trite.<br /><br />I was almost belligerently angry about the whole experience--the hype leading to the wasting of my time.  It was literally painful to read.  I felt duped.<br /><br />Silver lining?  The uncontrollable laughter I succumbed to upon reading these Amazon reviews.  Sweet, sweet vindication.  I'm not the only one.  Thank you all
B0085LGL5E|5.0|after a listen much better than I had expected....loud, rocking beats.  very full of energy and puts off a fun vibe.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am a big pro on the games and all. also, I just had it updated.  YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS GAME
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it is very useful and easy to use<br />it helps you save reminders for later<br />it is also very organized
B005G5PPGS|5.0|First off, this book is a great story. I haven't seen the movie yet and I'm glad I haven't - because I can't imagine it being as good as the book. Even if you're not interested in baseball, it's still a good read about how a man (Billy Beane) put together good baseball teams cheaper than the rest of the league using statistics that weren't used by the rest of the league. For any sports fan (not just baseball fans), I would recommend this book.<br /><br />Now, for the statistics - I'm a nerd when it comes to that kind of stuff and was hoping for more raw statistics. There are some, and the author explains why they are important, but I was looking for more. However, I was pleasantly surprised that even though the book wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be, it was still a good book.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|it is a very good and cool game. like how it has multiplayer. hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Relationships are built on small things. Sharing food, laughing at the same things, helping one another when troubled. Mapplethorpe and Smith built a beautiful and lasting friendship on just such small things and it is reflected in Smith's simple but moving language. In my book group, where the average age is probably 65, I wondered if they would be able to handle the Village Rocker context. They loved the book and even those who had resisted reading it admitted they were truly glad they had! We should all be as lucky as they were in our friendships.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey captured my attention. It did have a lot of repetition I noticed, but that was her writing style, I suppose. Then I immediately went into fifty shades darker. Progressively disappointing. Then this. Fifty Shades Freed. Such a disappointment.<br /><br />Grammar and the constant \\"same phrases\\" got really old. I would actually skim over the sex scenes because at this point, who cares anymore? They only knew eachother for, what, a few months before getting engaged- not to mention his obsessive stalker tendencies and S&M world.. for any virgin and/or someone who doesnt date a whole lot, I think a little more time would have been better... So now they are married- ok? and the plot disappears. The apex of the book is less than a chapter long and its the fastest kidnapping/blackmail/fight scene ever.<br /><br />I believe this book was extremely rushed and needed more depth to it. OR as many have said, just stopped at book 2. I was perfectly fine with ending there.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is amazing! Once you start, you won't be able to put the books down. You will find yourself discussing Ana and Christian like they are real people. It does get steamy but behind all of that is a wonderful love story that will have you asking your significant other \\"Why can't you be more like Christian Grey?\\"<br /><br />If you have time to spare and are a sucker for a good love story this is definitely a book you'll want to have in your collection!<br /><br />P.S. Word to the wise: You will want to have book two downloaded and ready to go BEFORE you finish book one so that you can immediately begin reading to find out what happens next.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books are fun, full of excitement, enteraining. I found myself not wanting to put them down. It has put the spark back in my bedroom. Yes there was a lot of sex, but a great story line to go with it. Never once thought a teenager wrote it!! I recommend this book to anyone, don't know what to do know that I've read all 3.....
B007MNV5WU|4.0|everything was all good until it said that something was wrong with the game and I had to foreclose it! but it was still cool that you could click on the sattalite and learn about Nasa and space.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book, Recommend it highly,I can't wait to finish the other two. My whole family and friends are reading the books.
B0086700CM|2.0|This game lags a lot.  I don't like the game temple run for kindle fire. it should just stick with apple.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I love how this app has so much information available but it's still easy to use. I use it every day, and the forecast is accurate and I never have to wait a long time for it to load. It's really fabulous.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Prequels to extremely popular films rarely turn out well.  By and large, they're not great, and only occasionally good.  Even rarer is a prequel that is just as good as the originals...but \\"Prometheus\\" is not one of them.  It gets so tantalizingly close to reaching that coveted rank, but just misses it.<br /><br />In the near future, a group of scientists travel to a distant planet for the scientific expedition of a lifetime: the chance to learn exactly where humans came from, and the chance to meet with our creators.  But upon arriving, they quickly learn that they may have discovered something that will lead to humanity's end.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"Prometheus\\" is an excellent film: its basic concept (what if humans were created by aliens and we could go and meet them?) is fantastic; the atmosphere and visuals are top notch, and when the film hits it's stride, it's an undeniable masterpiece, especially during the first half, where there's a constant sense of exploration and adventure, of finding new things and getting closer and closer to a coveted goal.  \\"Prometheus\\" functions as a prequel to 1979's, \\"Alien\\" and although events in this film do not lead into the original, there are numerous winks and nods towards what has come before, which are a delight for fans of the Xenomorph creature.  I especially loved learning more about the so called, \\"Space Jockey\\" creature that was seen in the original, and learning more about it's species, which arguably makes for the most engaging moments in the film.<br /><br />Sadly however, while \\"Prometheus\\" is more often then not, a fascinating film, it makes some huge blunders along the way.  The pacing in the second half of the second act unexpectedly ratchets up from slow paced to breakneck, with things happening so fast it's easy to loose track of what's going on, especially with regards to the characters (of which there are too many), and why they act the way they do; for a bunch of scientists, they make some really stupid decisions (look!  An alien life form!  Let's try to pick it up when it's clearly angry at us!) and do really bizarre things (one character, after going through a rather horrific act, goes back to wandering around the ship/exploring without bothering to tell anyone what happened, which bugs me to no end).  David the android, in particular, while fascinating to watch, lacks the simple, effective characterization that Ash and Bishop had; he does things seemingly out of random, and even two days after seeing the film, I'm still trying to figure out his motivations.<br /><br />The editing also adds to the frustration, as I got the sense that a lot was cut out of the finished film, as the rushed pace feels like a lot was cut out to save on the running time.  But worst of all is the feeling of not getting any closure. \\"Prometheus\\" raises questions it has no intention of answering, and with the ending hinting towards a sequel, the movie feels frustratingly incomplete, rather then a stand-alone film.<br /><br />While \\"Prometheus\\" comes so tantalizingly close to being a perfect film, it's incomplete feeling, breakneck speed, and choppy editing pull it down (though the third act does manage to recover, and ends with a rather spectacular finale).  It's a great movie, and when it worked, I was more absorbed in it then any other film in recent memory, but I was left with the maddening feeling that it could have crossed the threshold into classic territory if it had been a little more focused and tightened up.  Still, for what it is, it's a great ride for anyone who's ever wondered if we owe our existence to beings beyond the stars.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This a very good game.  Well executed and clean interface.  However, if you are playing this on the kindle fire, you better have a stylus.  The fire's display is not large enough to allow the use of your fingers for selecting cells.
B00007E7K0|4.0|I foolishly assumed this cap would be OEM based on the Canon label and packaging photo. It seems a decent quality replacement but not identical to the Canon cap I lost. Frustrated because the Canon website offers an authentic cap for same price but I purchased here because the shipping seemed more fair. The cap fits my lens but seems just a bit 'off' compared to original. I wouldn't return because it suits it's purpose but I do feel duped.<br />On a plus, the transaction was smooth and the vendor shipped very quickly!

B003N5VOUO|5.0|Movie is really good.  I always wanted to see this movie and I have finally seen it.  Movie's story line is great from start to finish.  Definitely would recommend anyone to see it.  It's worth watching.  I would definitely do business again with this seller.  Product came fast without encountering any issues.<br />Movie rating: 10/10
B000M343BM|5.0|Can't go wrong with a classic!  The disc was in perfect condition and the \\"Wild Thing\\" menu was fun.  Something you must own if you live in Cleveland and have a sense of humor.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Bought this for my girlfriend.  She loved it.  According to her, the series are great.  Never seen it or plan to.  Product came as described and was shipped fast.
B004LWZVZM|1.0|I was unable to play the movie due to the features playing when PLAY MOVIE was selected.In addition,the DVD menu is overrode so that you cannot opt out of all the previews of other movies they are trying to sell...you must watch all 12-15 minutes of these,or fast forward through each and every preview.After all of this nonsense,I still was not able to see the movie.Now I need to take care of the refund process.What a waste of time.Consumer beware!!
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Great movie.  I loved it.  I couldn't stop laughing.  Definitely would recommend this movie to anyone.  You will not regret it.  The only down fall about this movie is the story line plot is pretty much based upon the first hangover movie.  Definitely would do business again with the seller.  Product came fast without encountering any issues.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is way too addicting! I can not stop playing it! even the kids enjoy this game! great way to pass the time

0345803485|5.0|This was a non-stop read. Very difficult to put down. The author amazingly descriptive with the thoughts and emotions written in the main characters point of view. After I finished book 1 I immediately ordered Book 2&3. My neighbor borrowed the 1st book, was unsure if she could read with the graphic nature, found herself missing hours of sleep and 'hide reading' it at work. I really hope the author writes more books of this nature, pure talent. For those of you who think this book to be trashy porn,I believe you to be highly mistaken, there is a story line here that explains what early childhood influences have on a person.<br /><br />...And the seller?.... Received quicker than expected,Book in excellent condition...Thanks!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Bought this series for my girlfriend.  She loves this fringe.  Product came fast and as described.  If anyone loves fringe, you should definitely get this.
0345803485|1.0|This book is everywhere.  Everyone is talking about it.  So...I decided to take the bait and see what all the hype was about.<br /><br />Can you say \\"mistake?\\"<br /><br />I'll keep this short and sweet (or not so sweet...?).<br /><br />I truly felt this was Twilight minus vampires and werewolves, plus S&M.  Seriously, the parallels are uncanny.  At least Twilight was age-appropriate.  They were teenagers acting as such.  Here, Anastasia's a 21-year old virgin who blushes when she's asked anything - including if she has any siblings.  Really?  Christian Grey = Edward, Jose & Paul = Jacob, Anastasia = (obviously) Bella.  Needless to say, Anastasia goes for the not-so-safe character...shocker.<br /><br />In addition to these obvious similarities to another popular book series, there wasn't a sufficient storyline for me.  There are plenty of characters, and only two are even adequately developed.  Wait.  Christian Grey is a \\"mystery,\\" so he's not truly developed character-wise either.  The last chapter seriously had me thinking \\"This is why men think women are so difficult.\\"  If you can suffer through the mundane Cinderella story of regular girl meets attractive, intelligent, rich boy, you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Overall, I was not impressed with this piece of work because of the overused/almost absent storyline.  Then the realization hits: it is erotica.  Storyline-optional.
0439023513|4.0|Part 3 of the series. I feel that the 1st book was the best written. This is an easy read, yet entertaining.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|VEVO never heard of it. Now it's all I listen too. Great app for wacthing my favotite songs. Looks really sharp and runs fast on my Kindel Fire. Price is free with no trial junk. Fun video app!

0345803485|1.0|The only way I can describe this extremely poorly written book. Did a high school girl write this? Not only is this person not even remotely familiar with the Pacific NW, she repeats words/phrases ad nauseum. I forced myself to finish it, but it was difficult to say the least. Save your money and your time, the book sucks!<br />I am astounded that people actually liked this book. Goes to show you, to each his own....
B007MAETA8|4.0|just like almost everyone i got originally blown away by Continuum and hence my first listen to Born and Raised was a disappointment...i mean where are the guitar riffs? where is the incredible two rock tone? BUT...don't get discouraged and give it another try: this is a beautiful mellow album which grows on you like crazy...the genius of it is in its simplicity and maturity...great stuff and i can't wait to see what's next from this talented guy
B007Y36K46|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I've seen all year - lots of action, imaginative, great graphics, it was so entertaining.  I immediately bought this movie after renting it.  The title was just so flat, I did not want to see it when it was in the theater.  Now I wish I had seen it in the theater on the big screen.  Once I  read other reviews I thought I'd try it. It is really great sci-fi, like StarWars, yes I'm comparing it to StarWars.  The characters, story line and actually the movie was better than the book. It took on a modern flare so to speak.<br />I do not know why it was not received well at the theater. Perhaps it was released along side another more popular movie. The reviews of the theatrical release were wrong - this is a great movie. Look at all the other reviews. Hundreds of people loved this movie.  It's great for kids.  I wish there would be more. I know a series was initially supposed to happen but the movie release in the theater was so poor, Disney probably dumped the idea.  But this is a GREAT movie, and the actor who played John Carter was great.  I'd love to see him in other things.<br />Definately this is a must see sci-fi for the entire family!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like that I can access my notes with both my mobile devices.  It is a valuable feature for me.
0374275637|5.0|I enjoyed reading thinking fast and slow. It is fascinating in my practice as a clinical and neuropsychologist. I would say that it takes a bit of concentration and focus. It also is good for brain stimulation.

B008133MDK|5.0|Their take on Sherlock Holmes in the modern world is quirky and unique, but so loyal to who Sherlock was when he was written.  In some cases, I think this newer version makes me appreciate the old Sherlock better.  The characters are great to watch - Watson is amazing.  I only wish there were more episodes.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this but love Sherlock Holmes, please watch this.  You will be bitten like the bug like I was.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a  totally different book for me to read but I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series! I read all three books in a little over a week. At first I was a little disturbed with all the sexual stuff but then when I got into the book I realized that the story leading up to Christian's lifestyle had a very sad story of his early life.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Many have described Prometheus as Ridley Scott's attempt to take Alien to the level of Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001, and I think that's broadly a good assessment. However, while I found the film enjoyable, it never quite reaches the heights of either of its spiritual predecessors.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />When I first heard about the concept of aliens creating men, I was worried. However, it's important not to take the science in the film too seriously. Even Ridley Scott says this isn't a science class. It is kind of silly that these large humanoid aliens called the \\"Engineers\\" (or Space Jockeys for fans of the original Alien) created humans. The film even points out the ridiculousness of the concept when the biologist jokes it would throw out \\"300 years of Darwinism.\\" In watching the movie, it becomes clear pretty quickly that the plot is a device to answer philosophical questions about the nature of God, creation, and death. The atmosphere and story during the first half of the movie is great.<br /><br />The acting is also surprisingly good. Other reviewers have gone on about how good the big three - Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Charlize Theron - are, so all I'll say is that I really enjoyed their performances. Fassbender's performance as the android is stunning in how calmly chilling he is. Some of his lines were so cruel, yet so innocently recited, that I want to rematch the movie just to see him. Most of the other characters I thought were fine, with some exceptions (particularly Noomi Rapace's character's husband who came off as a lame Ashton Kutcher wannabe).<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that its exploration of these themes and acting are hampered by action/horror scenes that clearly weren't well thought out. As other reviewers noted, many of the deaths are caused by characters making stupid decisions. Many reviewers have criticized the crew for taking off their helmets, which at first is fine because one would expect that alien microbes would not be able to infect humans. However, once it was apparent that the Space Jockey DNA was the same as humans AND that one of the crew members was infected, they still continue to take their helmets off! Other stupid decisions include the biologist's attempt to pet a snake; the captain's decision to open the ship's door when a crew member's signal is detected without receiving audio confirmation from him; and the fact that the characters can only run straight to avoid a rolling ship. Overall, the action scenes seem like they were a symptom of today's brain dead Hollywood.<br /><br />For me, the biggest drawback to the movie was pacing. The beginning was slow, which was fine by me. However, when the action starts, it never really slows down. The audience isn't given time to breathe and absorb. The tension never really builds. For example, after Noomi Rapace's infamous scene, she runs down the hallways and has a conversation with the crew, and then they go try to communicate with the Space Jockeys. First of all, the fact that Rapace's character doesn't even inform the other crew members about what happened to her is ridiculous. But then the movie switches gears so quickly that it's like it never happened. Rapace's character is clearly hurting from the encounter, but not as much as she probably would in real life.<br /><br />Another major problem is that the film leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I'm not an Alien fanboy - I don't need to know every detail about the Space Jockey's origins. However, major plot points that are (deliberately) left open, setting it up for a sequel. I like some mystery, but for most viewers the movie will seem incomplete or ridiculous. For example, as many other reviewers have noted, it seems pretty stupid for one of the Space Jockey's, presumably an intelligent alien species, to simply start killing humans, arguably an intelligent species, when he wakes up after sleeping for 2,000 years. The film hints that theremight be a reason why the Space Jockeys hate humans so much, but you'd think he would at least be confused at seeing humans or worried that they were able to travel so far. As it is the Space Jockey's actions look more like Hollywood's attempt to throw in some mindless violence. Maybe it'll all make sense after we see the inevitable sequel, but too much of it just doesn't seem to have been thought through very clearly.<br /><br />Overall, if you like sci-fi, especially the Alien franchise, Prometheus is well worth seeing. Don't set your expectations too high, and be willing to accept some thoughtless plot points. I'd give the movie 3 stars. If Ridley Scott and his scriptwriters had put a bit more thought into the plot, it could have been so much more.<br /><br />UPDATE on Blu-Ray (10/15/12):<br /><br />My initial review was a bit harsh, but upon rewatching the movie I think it was eminently justified. While there are some interesting philosophical concepts, they're buried deep beneath stupid characters and poor scriptwriting. The contrast with Scott's Alien, which I also recently rewatched, is telling. Alien never pulled me out of the movie and the characters seemed utterly believable. It's just a shame Prometheus didn't quite work on that level.<br /><br />The blu-ray set comes with all the standard deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, and commentaries. The deleted scenes are definitely the highlight. As happens so often, I wonder why they were deleted. The deleted version of the Fiefield fight uses a much more interesting Fiefield monster concept than the ugly guy we saw in the film. Also, Vickers has a few compelling character moments in the deleted scenes. Even the Engineer has more character. The deleted scene gives him a very compelling reason for attacking the Promtheus crew, whereas in the finished film he seems like a mindless brute. In short, Prometheus would have been a much better movie with these scenes incorporated.<br /><br />The 4-disc set comeswith even more impressive special features, particularly the 3-hour \\"The Furious Gods\\". This is the documentary that the ads claim will \\"answer\\" the questions left from the film's plot holes. While that goes a bit too far, \\"The Furious Gods\\" is rich in content. I enjoyed hearing about the making of the movie, from beginning to end. It is definitely revealing, both in good ways and bad, However, I really don't like the idea of \\"enhancement pods\\", which essentially require you to interrupt the documentary in order to watch shorter featurettes. I'd have preferred if the short featurettes were simply part of the feature documentary.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am simply entertained and spent hours sitting outside playing this game.I think any one would love this game. enjoy the fun.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I realize I have made enemies here but th title says it all. The thought of this band trying to sound like AIC is a nightmare from beginning to end. Boring and disappointing. A few sloppily played speed metal solos don't save grace either. Returned to the store for a refund.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun to try to get more coins. I'm on the 3rd page working on the 4th.
B005974CDU|5.0|This a good solid effort but it isn't \\"Images And Words\\". No new ground here but they haven't strayed from their roots, just turn the drums up a little. Just one question here and not about the drums: is it just my imagination or is Petrucci starting to sound like Yngwie? Enough about Portnoy - he left a winning team to go back to the minor leagues of his own freewill, so enough already. But again, I swear it sounds like Petrucci is going for Yngwie's \\"Fire and Ice\\" mellow strat tone. His metal tone is better and once again the new drummer is fine - just turn him up.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Gamers strive to be the predominant power on the island of Catan whilst building settlements, metropolitan areas, and roadways. On every flip of the dice you determine what resources the island produces. Gamers collect the resources to build up their civilizations with the aim of getting 10 victory points to win the game. What can I say  it's Multi-award-winning and one of the most popular games in recent times due to its amazing ability to appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike. The only other set that holds my daughter for longer is Lego Lord of The Rings.<br />[[ASIN:B007Q0OUP8 LEGO The Lord of the Rings Hobbit The Mines of Moria (9473)]]

0375851569|5.0|This was a good start to the collection of Dr Seuss books I wanted to start for my kids. I hope to be able to collect them all so they can be passed down.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Started and couldn't stop - had to finish in one go.  Loved the twists and turns, the madness and depth of love.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't finish a page fast enough. It was totally riveting from the first page to the last. An amazing book.
0439023491|5.0|I loved how the characters evolved in this book and the situations they were thrown into. The action was very well paced and the story was well developed. I think of the 3 books this was my favorite as we already knew the characters but were suprised at what they now did. A bit of a spoiler, the arena for this one was just interesting as you didnt know what to expect and was wildly different and handled different from the first book. Katniss is a bit annoying but not in a way that detracted for me. I dont have to adore main characters all the time as, well I dont adore everyone in the world.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that you can listen to the Bible!  That is the best thing for me. That way I can &quot;read&quot; the Bible while I work.
0439023513|4.0|I loved this entire series. This book I didnt like as much as the other two. I found the story to drag a little and be a bit dark. Some of it was a bit unbelievable. I did enjoy seeing the characters evolve in a different way in this book while not under the same constraints as in the first two books. I enjoyed the idea that what we think is the most evil is sometimes better then something else.
B006OB3K56|4.0|*  Some Spoilers *<br /><br />The conversation in the weeks leading up to the release of Steve McQueen's film usually were about the amount of sex in the film or about the size of Michael Fassbender's privates.  There's no build up to either of these in the film; McQueen puts them front and center of the film's opening scenes, as if to say, \\"Here ya go.  Happy?  Can we get on with it?\\"<br />There are quite a few sex scenes but they are anything but erotic and this is how Brandon feels.  He never seems to enjoy the fact that he's able to sleep with all these women (His boss tries to pick up a blonde at an upscale lounge but fails miserably; Brandon takes said blonde to a secluded spot for some one-on-one time).  His past, alluded to by his needy sister (an equally ravaged soul), has scarred him to the point where he doesn't seem to revel in any sort of postcoital bliss.<br />He asks a co-worker out on a date and you expect a guy who's smooth and charming.  The date is a bit awkward, even by first date standards.  He admits his longest relationship lasted about 4 months.  When he finally gets her in a hotel room, he can't perform.  Though he has only gone out with her once, Brandon finds himself unable to sleep with her and brush her off.  He later gets another woman into the room and is able to find release.<br />The key scene involves Brandon and his lecherous boss (played by James Badge Dale) going to see Brandon's sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan) sing at a bar.  She sings a haunting rendition of the theme from \\"New York, New York.\\"  The ache in her voice reverberates through Brandon, who tears up; his boss thinks it's because his sister is so talented, not realizing that it's because the lyrics describe that need to rise above one's circumstances that is at the core of the Sullivan's siblings shattered psyches.<br />\\"Shame\\" explores Brandon's inability to make any real connections with others, as well as with his own self.<br />It's ridiculous that I can't downloadmy digital copy onto iTunes.  Loss of a star.  Shame on you, Fox!
B0041OOEJY|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters, and was VERY entertained.  I think it flowed pretty well, and the acting was stellar.<br /><br />I never really saw the original, just bits and pieces here and there.  (My friends just stared at me speechless when I told them this!) so I was going in with no expectations.  What I walked out of the theater with was something that had me smiling from ear to ear.  I don't know why all those one-star reviewers scored it so low...massive nostalgia goggles, I guess.<br /><br />I saw nothing wrong with this movie (other than the misnomer of a title...really should've been the Kung Fu kid, but everyone already has said that a million times!) and would recommend it to pretty much anyone.<br /><br />Well done, I say.
B00005JMUA|4.0|*  Spoilers  *<br /><br />Where as Volume 1 had over the top violence, there's an undercurrent of menace in Volume 2.  The Bride reminds everyone that she's going after Bill, her ex-employer/ex-lover, who, along with her ex-colleagues, tried to kill her at her wedding rehearsal.  The Bride takes a moment to herself during the rehearsal to get away from the minister's annoying wife and finds Bill sitting outside.  Bill (played to smooth, chilled perfection by David Carradine) seems like an affable guy (though by now you know he'd put a bullet in a pregnant woman's skull) with hippie-ish tendencies.  Later on he reveals a geeky side (waxing poetic on Superman comics) and a paternal facade.  All throughout though, you know just how ruthless he is when someone crosses him.<br /><br />Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is Salieri to the Bride's Mozart (at least as portrayed in \\"Amadeus\\").  Jealous and conniving, she is not only intent on taking out the Bride but anyone who dares steal that honor for themselves.  Michael Madsen is amazing as Bill's estranged, younger brother, Budd.  A drunk, he's the only former member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad that seems to not have a comfortable living.  He's living in a trailer, working as a bouncer/janitor at a third-rate strip club.  He's also the only one of the DeVAS (including the Bride) who expresses any real regret about his past.  Bill visits him, having learned of the deaths of 2 of the DeVAS, and offers his assistance.  Budd turns him down, almost seeming to accept a fate he feels is deserved.  However, he's got something up his sleeve.<br /><br />As always, Tarantino's use of music is on par with other great directors.  He draws on a variety of genres, though this film relies heavily on musical cues drawn from Westerns (American or otherwise)<br /><br />If there is one criticism I have is that the films drags toward the end.  Yes, we see how the Bride became such an effective killer, but I would have rather have learned more about Bill.<br /><br />Tarantino indicts us all, the audience, for rooting for the Bride by reminding us that we're not on the side of some innocent.  She is an assassin and her becoming a mother doesn't wash away all her sins.  Fans of the film have since wondered whether we'll ever get a sequel involving someone, a true innocent, seeking revenge against the Bride herself.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Hubby always liked this movie. I never payed it much mind. But today I couldn't figure out what to watch. So I pooped Rocky in and really enjoyed it. I can see why he likes this movie. This is a great movie. I'm happy we own it.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|People who want easy answers will be unsatisfied, but this visual spectacle had more intellectual meat than most movies, sci fi or otherwise.
B00006D295|5.0|Call me crazy, but I LOVE this movie. My friend from back in the day told me about The Rocky Horror Picture. Never saw it before or after he told me about it. Many years later I saw it at Walmart for $5. I bought it right away. Watched it and then later found my self singing\\" touch me touch me touch me touch me.... I want to be dirty\\" when I was at work.... LOL.<br /><br />This movie reminds me of Little Shop Of Horrors. Witch is another movie that I LOVE!!!! This movie is just a little more X-Rated.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I have to say I just watched this film and I loved it. I avoided it at the theaters because of the terrible reviews, but now that I've seen it, I can't understand the bad reviews. The film was fun and very well done.This is an action film and if your looking for action, this is the film to see. The story was interesting and I enjoyed it so much,I'm going to find the books the film is based on and I'm going to read them. Don't trust any of the bad reviews-see it for yourself.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|My eleven-year-old son is an advanced reader, and I've purchased many Kindle books for him. I usually don't have time to read as much as he does, so I just trust the reviews and read a synopsis here or there.<br />He began reading this book, and he noticed there was a TV series. When we investigated the TV series on IMDB, we had to discuss the sex and incest in the book. My son said he was enjoying the storyline of the book, but he was bothered by the \\"sex parts\\" in the book and started skipping over them.<br />The consensual sex between a brother and a sister is really not something I would like my young adolescent reading about. I'm willing to tolerate well-crafted characters who deal with real-life problems--even when those problems are difficult issues, but a character witnessing the incest and describing it was just too much.<br />This series is definitely meant for older teens and adults.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a lot of fun and time consuming. great way to spend a lazy afternoon. I love the variety of games it offers
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This is  a terrific, quick, summer beach read.  Please read books one and two first. It's a trilogy that  must be read in order.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this was a very good book it kept me on my toes and reading 24/7<br /><br />**consider age when reading this book**<br />if it were a movie it would be R or be considered porn
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|It can best be described as \\"Midnite Express\\" meets \\"Deliverance.\\" Unpleasant is an understatement.<br /><br />Each character has been morphed into a wanker. Who OK'd this script? Not one laugh and I'm into it half an hour.<br /><br />To those of you who have already viewed this, I'm so sorry. Oh gawd, they just showed a tranny prostitute with breasts and a penis. Full frontal. Yes, this must be the Deliverance homage part. Aauugh! This movie is beyond horrible!
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game! no lag. get it now! the hottest game. running through the jungle with nothing to loose... but your life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love love love love love love love love this game I almost beat It because it is so so so so much fun
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I'm so addicted to it<br />cant stop playing it. awesome!!!!!!<br />I'm so happy I was able to get this on my kindle fire
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy and fun. Great game to start out with on your Kindle.  Fun for the kids to play too. I would recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|numerous goals make it easy to get addicted its extremely easy to play and unlike the tap village games it doesn't take hours for land expansion or families to be &quot;ready&quot;
B005P59ANS|3.0|Pros:<br />*I dropped my phone a lot, not one crack<br />*Once got water sprayed on me with my phone in my hand, no phone damage at all<br />*Really pretty pink color<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Can't put phone in a iPod/phone dock<br />*Can't have other headphones other than the apple ones without the adapter<br />*Difficult to take off the case<br />*Difficult to use the silence button on the side of the phone
B0086700CM|5.0|I am soooooo addicted to this game! The only problem is that sometimes I swipe in a correction and it doesn't work.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Version 1.2.1 was released 4 days ago with planet level 4, yet the Kindle Fire version had yet to update. They're still saying version 1.1.1 is the only current version. At $2.99, I'm a premium customer and deserve the prompt upgrade. Well, what's up, Amazon?
B005ZUR724|4.0|I played this game for a day then stoped playing for 3 months. the game is made well and is a very decent mmo expecially since its made for tablets. I'm giving this game another try because as far as I know, its well worth what its worth.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|Fits my camera well and there is a lot of extra space. I don't like to carry an extra bag when I take my camera out so it is nice to have everything fit in one bag.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wow, ive seen this app on the apple store, I'm so glad they finally put this out onto the Amazon app store.
0345803485|5.0|Well done! A wonderful tale between what's expected, anticipated, and desired!  This series will allow one to explore and process their own dominance and submissive values.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|What a complete disappointment, to slog through all the books and Houses and travails, etc. and then to have an ending that resolved so little and left so much hanging.  It was as if he just got tired and said, \\" OK, Let's just stop here, kill off a few before we go and leave the rest to their imagination\\".  Very unsatisfying!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. I didn't feel that it was all just about sex. It is a love story full of drama romance and some comedy. The way the author describes Anna's fellings about everything really put my head in the story and I could visualize everything that was happening.
B005URRCUY|5.0|El Camino is a great selection of songs by the Black Keys. What a fine representation from a northeast Ohio band; great job guys!
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|This is such a great band and such a great idea, changing the world for the better using music as the medium. The work done by these folks is more than extraordinary, there love and commitment shines through and the music is so great, you will not be disappointed with this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game on theKindel forever!!!I was just looking at games and when I saw it I got siked! Best game and pretty appropriate for kids so why not?I would deffiently suggest this game for peopel who like callenging and kinda freaky.Its fifteenth and cool
B006G2ZEV6|1.0|There see no subtitles on devices running I've cream sandwich.  This makes the game nearly unplayable.  Otherwise, it's a great game.  Please fix this soon.
0060935464|5.0|Liked this copy of the classic novel.<br />There are enough differences that you can't get away with watching the movie and not reading the book. Besides, you would be doing yourself a great disservice not to read that amazing novel.
0345803493|5.0|This trilogy has reignited the flames between me and my husband. Although this is primarily a story about true love, its passion is a welcomed and embraced addition.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|This movie was my first encounter (you know what I mean) with Ed Norton. I was floored. It's more than worth the watch just to see his last ten minutes on camera.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. So does my daughter. So many translations. My daughter loves that it will read the Bible to her. Love not having to flip pages in church.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a good book.  The only reason I bought it was because there has been so much hype about this trilogy and I saw the author on the view and she was older and I thought how odd could it be.  Well, it does have some very erotic things in the book but the nice thing about having a Kindle is that no one can see what you are reading.  I told my daughter that I was reading it (she is 36) and she told me \\"Mom, that is too much TMI\\"...lol  I have already bought the second book and I am sure when I am done with that I will purchase the third.  It is a nice summer read...
B00499K9E0|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like a modern version of Sherlock Holmes, but I do. It has all of the classic Sherlock investigations, but modernized with present-day gadgets such as cell phones, computers, etc. Love Cumberbatch & Freeman as well.
B003D0ZNWY|2.0|I like to collect \\"complete works sets\\" of the major classical composers. Unfortunately, due to my own ignorance, I ordered the Mahler set.  But upon listening to it, I was disappointed that almost all of Mahler's work included choral and solo vocal pieces.  I enjoyed the orchestral pieces, but not the majority of pieces on this 16-CD set.  I would heartily recommend it to classical music lovers who enjoy choral and vocal pieces, but these are not my cup of tea.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|While Robert Downey mummbled his way through the entire film, the director inserted one silly acton scene after another - ruining the whole movie. There was no mystery or plot - just a bad script and embarrassingly Americanized characters. Downey came off as a half-deranged ne'er-do-well, and McAdams' character was unlikeable and superfluous. Law did a good job as Watson - it's just too bad he got stuck in this stinker.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Well, I spent some time moving the mouse cursor over the rent button wondering if this movie would be anything worth watching. As it turns out, it wasn't at all a bad movie, and it gives you a nice little glimpse of what our special forces do in real life. Now the acting and script at times is a bit lacking, but it didn't destroy the movie like you would expect it would have in many other such movies. Thus the reason for 4 stars.. It was also almost like watching an episode of GI Joe with the nice little lesson message at the end. And giving how America these days is becoming dangerously close to a Christian religious totalitarian theocracy, I think the movie and the message at the end of the movie (in the poem) is something everyone should really pay attention to. And for the action fans out there, this movie doesn't disappoint as it does a fairly good job of bringing that to the table.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this app but the problem is it shows the same artist for every cover of a different album. That is so not cool please fix thank you.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|My wife read these books and tried to read it to me, when I started to spank her mercilliously, he didn't think it was so funny ......I thought thats what Christian did to Ana!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Since other people have given a plot synopsis I won't do that, instead I will give the reader one more piece of advice. Pay close attention to what GRRM has written, because he doesn't waste words. Every word he writes is significant. This is one of the benefits of GRRM taking so much time to write each book, because every book is so tightly written.After all is said and done, GRRM is not a great fantasy author alone, he is a great writer. He just happens to be a great writer who enjoys writing in the fantasy genre.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book is so bad I had to take the time to write a review. The elementary writing is simply aweful. Can you say repetative repetative repetative?! One would figure that as the books continue, their characters would develop...nope. If you are just interested in corny,redundant, s&m type of erotica, then you may like this book. But this novel was very poorly written, it constantly repeats its lines, & it makes you hate its characters. Who would publish this?! I love to read & although this is fiction, you want the book to make sense, the chracters to be believable. I'm sorry but it's just aweful.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|I have been waiting for so long for this movie to come to theatres!  Finally, it has made its release but in only about 15 theatres nationwide...and none of them are remotely close to me.  I was so appreciative to have found this pre-release on Amazon.  All of the performances were very well done and fitting to the era.  Robert Pattinson was immensely enjoyable, while making you love and hate his character at the same time.  Pattinson truly does have great range, despite what has been said about some of his films.  The women were incredible, as was the storyline!  The depth, lies, deceit, and steps taken to rise to power made for a memorable story that is sure to keep you captivated.  It is not hard to imagine that this would have actually taken place.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love to write good reviews but this book...really? I'm sorry but this is simply trashy literature. Sounds like some inexperienced writer teenager fantasy. I glanced through the book on my sister's Nook, I'm not trying to insult the writer but reading this book is truly a waste of time. It is poorly written, unrealistic and for a lack of a better word, corny.
B0086700CM|4.0|I'd easily go to 5 stars if the app had &quot;Help&quot; - great game!! Basics are easy to learn and very addicting!!
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I've read all of Sedaris' books; this is one of my favorites.  I particularly loved his observations of the Japanese culture and his failed attempts to learn the language.  I also loved his essay on the very long journey of giving up smoking.  He really knows how to exploit the smallest details.  I will definitely recommend this book to my friends.

B000001GAM|5.0|Carlo Maria Giulini's recording of Bruckner's unfinished 9th Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic has been around quite awhile and it has taken me a long time to get around to it.  I acquired his recording of the same composer's 8th symphony and was not so blown away by it as I am with this one, I think mainly because it fell, just, in the shadow of Karajan's magnificent account with the same orchestra, the VPO again.  So I didn't buy Giulini's 9th.  My loss!  This is an extraordinary recording.  Awesome is a word that is used too often in an inane pop style that diminishes its meaning when something like this comes along and truly deserves the accolade.  Bruckner composed the 9th in a spirit that seems to have already consigned part of its consciousness to off-planet realms.  The final movement is often moving and beautiful but never have I been left so stunned by it before.  The first movement is unusually powerful under Giulini's direction.  The pounding tuba notes near the end sound like the horn of judgment summoning all of mankind to judgment day.  I have never heard this performed to such stunning effect elsewhere.  It is almost over the top, but then, this symphony is pretty much that way so the tuba menace is in keeping with this spectacular reading.  The final movement is on the same level of profundity.  It is like hearing this great symphony brand new.  If you are a Brucknerian you probably already have this recording, and have had it for a long time.  If you are exploring Bruckner for the first time or are expanding your library with a second or third or twentieth recording of this symphony, don't miss it.  It is truly special and should remain in DG's available recording lists FOREVER.

B007P3TMW2|1.0|I downloaded this movie to my kindle fire to view on vacation.  I also downloaded the decrndents.  The decendents downloadeod but up close and personal did not.  I assume I wad charged for it.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I'm giving this DVD a four star review despite finding the musical itself to be poorly written, ill conceived and just about wrong on every level.  I do this because from the direction of photography, to the costume and set design, to the performances, all involved really gave it their best and it shows. I think that is worth something.  The sets are really whimsical and spellbinding (despite not looking a thing like the Coney Island they are supposed to represent) and the music is exquisitely played and sung despite being tonally inconsistent, anachronistic,lacking in subtlety or nuance and even (at times) cribbed from everyone between Puccini to... old fashioned klezmer music.  This last part should come as no surprise though, considering the original Phantom is much the same.<br /><br />Ultimately, the show's biggest failing is in its inability to illustrate Love (capital L) of any kind.  Hinging on the unsubstantiated notion that Christine Daae was ever more than the Phantom's hostage in (for want of a better phrase, Part One), the story of Love Never Dies presupposes that she actually loved him and even insinuates that during the eighteen minutes she was his captive, they made sweet sweet love.  But does so in such a horrific way that every character finds that line between love sick and creepy/stalker and blows right through it.<br /><br />I  buy that through some heightened, 80s-rock-musical version of Stockholm Syndrome Christine could love her captor even though it's not at all supported in the text.  But when that same guy says to her \\"a man as hideous as me is capable of anything...\\"  well, that's just layers and layers of neurosis on both sides that at best leaves me completely disinterested and at worst makes me want to find something sharp and stick it in my eye.<br /><br />Ultimately though, it should not go unsaid that within this entire clown car of a script and score there is in fact ONE truly amazing moment where music, lyrics and drama all come together in a way that is not cheesy, unearned, overly clever or untrue to its characters.  And it's really quite satisfying to watch.  Which, if you consider how many mega-musicals can't even claim just one, is fairly remarkable.
B005HS00NW|4.0|I have been hearing M83's song Midnight City and have gone back on forth on whether to buy this double album.  It became a done-deal when Amazon offered an mp3 download for $3.99.  I am very glad I made this purchase.<br /><br />Simply put, this album sounds like a dream put to music.  Of course the standout track is Midnight City, but other favorites of mine are Wait, OK Pal, Splendor, Year One One UFO, Steve Mc Queen, and the magical Raconte-Moi Une Histoire.  Buy this album and escape into your own dreamland!
B0086700CM|5.0|IT IS FUN AND IT IS AWESOME. MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT. IF YOU TRY IT YOU WOULD KNOW IF YOU LIKE IT.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Chapters 1-3: My unbelievability alarm meter is beeping a horrible ring of warning and the bright red strobing light is reminding me of those people who get seizures by disco balls or bad tv. I am not impressed. The 20-something factor is dumbed down to high school mentality at best and this bumbling backward girl sprawling (literally tripping to splayed-out on the floor) in front of the billionaire is too Hollywood-gawk-wanna-be-princess for me.  So far I am completely anti-Grey. Knowing myself as I do, and the incredibly harsh critic I can be - or rather, one that requires respect to be earned - I will give it a bit more to win me over.<br /><br />Chapters 3-6: By now I should have been counting the number of references to being less than, in another class, another world, the what-am-I-doing-here's, and the I just don't belong or live at this level (golly jeepers) by the female protagonist. I am still less than impressed and dropping. My current review would have to be: 50 SOG seems to be written for all the naive, shallow, heterosexual American women, believing they are unified in a dream of the polite, complex, well-read (talking British historical literature here), musically-abled, more-money-than-God, and impossibly attractive men that command their attention, give them parent-like orders and whisk them to a world that is perfect and arousing in every way. Needless to say, I'm beyond wishing for being entertained. At this point I'm pretty much completely uninterested as well as disgusted by such irreverent views (and saddened by the mentality of the writer and readers, to be perfectly frank).<br /><br />A little further and the S&M factor has now completely turned me off. There really is very little story here (and what may possibly be called so, I don't like). I have no idea why this book got any press at all - I have no issue with racy books but if I can't learn something and actually be compelled, then it is not time-worthy at all.

1451627289|4.0|I haven't read Stephen King in years -- ever since I decided I didn't like being nightmarishly  scared from reading a book when there are enough scary things in real life. The buzz about 11/22/63 was that it was different, and the book's description, combined with my lifel-long morbid fascination with John F. Kennedy's assasination, compelled me to give it a whirl.<br /><br />This book shows that Stephen King's reputation as a master story teller is well deserved. I found some critics' complaints that enjoying the book required a total suspension of reality was actually a testament to King's skill -- I was caught up in the story from start to finish and moved by the love story at its core. Time travel is a fascinating concept, and the nagging question at the core of the protagonist's attempt to go back in time and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy was a fascinating exploration of the \\"Butterfly Effect\\" and unintended consequences.
B006IND5M8|4.0|It's one of the movies that if it was on tv , you would watch it . Its good to own but it's not fantastic . The acting is great and the special effects are good also .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has great variety. my kids absolutely love playing all the games. keeps them busy in the car for hours!
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|I absolutely love this album! I do have to admit that the after I listened to it the first time, a friend asked what I thought of it and I said it was okay and I didn't think it was their best. However, I was exercising at the time I was listening to it and I don't think this is an exercise type of album.<br /><br />I gave it another listen after that initial one and I really love every song. I keep listening to the entire album over and over. I have the deluxe edition and I'm not blown away by either of the remixes but the bonus track \\"F*** Yeah\\" is fun. I'm not going to give a break out of each song and why I like it. They are all great if you just give them some time and let them sink in. However, a few of my favorites are \\"San Luis Obispo,\\" \\"Shady Love,\\" \\"Only the Horses,\\" \\"Inevitable\\" and \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\" (such a fun song!).<br /><br />I can't believe how many bad reviews this album has received. I think those people should give it another listen or two. If you are a Scissor Sisters fan, give this a try. It is different than Night Work but it's cool. Night Work and this album are both wonderful in their own ways.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|love how challenging  it is without seeming  impossible, good if you want a challenge but not a headache.  Good amusing fun
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Landay was a pleasant surprise. The story had a slow start and I thought I had made a mistake purchasing it.  I kept reading was soon hooked into the intricacies of Jacob and the burden of the parents.
B0086700CM|5.0|its so awesome its the real one like on the ipod and ipad<br />I love it because you can purchase things in the store and it is awesome
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|In this mega-million, 3-D production masterpiece with it's high-paid stars and it's brilliant art direction and sets... (thus my 3 stars)<br /><br />...the Writing Simply Doesn't Work.<br /><br />Given the rush to produce and start shooting, however, it's understandable.<br /><br />Rather than bore anyone with endless dissections, I'll just state for the record the big problems I found with the script (there are many small ones) and the things that require far too much suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer:<br /><br />* The Engineer on the alien ship reacts violently upon awakening. Very illogical for a technologically superior race.<br /><br />* Shaw's \\"baby\\" grows to room-size without ingesting any food?<br /><br />* Human DNA is affected at the molecular level by the alien virus, yet there are tiny whip-like things surfacing in the infected character's eye.<br /><br />* Shaw doesn't get infected from sexual contact yet is capable of gestating the alien seed from her counterpart with no apparent side-affects.<br /><br />* The alien ship doesn't have any protection against being rammed by Prometheus.<br /><br />* The commander of the Prometheus is gone for long stretches, seemingly every time something horrible happens.<br /><br />and more...<br /><br />Other than that, I did enjoy the movie from a visual standpoint and it's technological wonders. I felt the beginning was highly compelling as well, but again, only made more questions instead of culminating with any real answer to the recombinant DNA sequence during the intro... How exactly did that connect to the whole? It didn't.<br /><br />This movie is good sci-fi entertainment, but creates far more questions than necessary. There's no fulfillment at the end, and while that may work perfectly for future sequel$, it doesn't really make this film a good stand-alone product in my opinion.<br /><br />I recommend it anyway to those who love Ridley Scott, the alien franchise, sci-fi and good thrillers. Bon appetit!appetit!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!!! It is so much fun to play!!!!!!!! I have so much fun playing this game on the kindle!!!!!
1455870102|5.0|Abundance of Katherines is a story about a young man who is in love.  There is some bad language in the audio but it is a good story to engage teens.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is great but it would be better if you added another character. like you could put in a fast track runner idk but anyway I love temple run
B0077SGMXM|1.0|First off, I love this game. I got it on my iPod touch 2nd generation a while ago, so, needless to say. I was excited to see it for Kindle Fire. But the reason I didn't get it was because of the price! I'm tired of having to pay 3 dollars for games other tablet users get for free (angry birds space, anyone?). instead, do yourself a tabor and get this app on 1mobile.com. it is free there and works perfectly on my kindle fire.
0345803485|1.0|This is one of the most poorly written books in history.  There is little story, no character development, no plot and the phrases are repeated throughout.  I am rolling MY eyes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever even though I am not that good my high score is 889,719 I wonder who got the highest score
B007P6VM4A|5.0|ONCE AGAIN THE HIVES PROVE THAT THEY ARE THE COOLEST BAND IN THE LAND. BAR NONE!!!<br />NOT A BAD SONG ON THE WHOLE CD. MY FAVORITE IS I WANT MORE.IF THEY RELEASE ANY CD SINGLES W/B-SIDES I WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE THEM AS WELL.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so addicted to this game and its been that way ever since 3 years ago. But I had no way to play it except on my friends Ipods!  I can not believe that they finally made Temple Run for kindle! I am so excited!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm writing this review to balance out the others giving 4 stars for the sole reason of a lack of editing. and to them i say \\"really?\\" you just hugely underpaid for an amazing independently written book and tarnish the esteem and rating of the book because of extremely minor editing mistakes/omissions (i read the book, and only noticed a punctuation error once...granted im not much of a grammar fiend, you have to pretty much LOOK for errors to be hung up on them.)
B0086700CM|5.0|i love temple run because its a balence way to use yiur hand and eye cornation. and it really fun. plis it free. so harm could it do to you if you got it....nothing. and its adicting.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is great game. plays good on the Fire and has great graphics. takes some getting used to play and ball control but otherwise GREAT GAME. Take your time and learn and you will not be disappointed. Hole in one gang.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game to help pass time. It's so fun and the graphics are great! The monkey things puny back legs make me laugh &quot;p It works well with kindle fire!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow, wow and wow!<br />Two things you need to know about this book:<br />1. You must read it, but be warned - you will read until the last page without regard for sleep or other possible distractions.<br />2. Once you finish, don't spoil the fun for others, so keep the novel's secrets to yourself.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game sis amazing who ever doesng like it is dumb dong pay attention to people who dont like it this game its so fun :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I can't think of anything else I would need or a better was to set it up.  i guess if you want to get crazy maybe there could be a severe weather alert, although it may have it and i just don't have it set up.
B00845PV16|4.0|OK, i am not going to do the spoiler thing or complain about anything. All that i will say is that if you are a fan of the comic, and not the really old stuff, you will enjoy this film. I got more of a sense that this was how ghost rider should have been done in the first place. the first film came off as trying to hard to get as close to the original ghost rider(comic book) as possible, but this film is more of the darker ghost rider. I would compare it to the punisher and the sequel War zone. the first film did the OK origin story and the second film gets more into the meat of the character. all the people complaining about Cages acting in this film seems way off to me, i mean, how would you act if you were possessed by the ghost rider. All that being said this seems to be more of a movie for a die hard fan then just your casual movie watcher.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It isn't my favorite weather app, but it works fine. I believe the weather channel app gives more info, but this one works and gives a reasonable amount of info. I've had no problems and it works great on my kindle fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have always waited for the day this app would be on here! I think I am addicted to this game! I love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I totally love this game! !!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!  It is so fun and super grool.  love it!!!  I fell in love with this game! !!  It is so totally super awesome game. love it!!!!!
B007UXTG8M|1.0|This movie is boring. Fine, I get it, he's a sex addict and his sister is crazy. But just cause you play deep serious music in the background does not make it so.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|good great cool game.I think you should get the game today.Ps. use gems on 10000 coins in the game today
B003Y5H5F6|1.0|Will not play in my Sony Blu-Ray player, Have not been able to see movie and do not know what to do about it
B0071MV540|3.0|...to not expect much. Not saying it was bad, but it's no Ocean's 11. It's Ben Stiller, not George Clooney...and as far as i could tell, no Brad Pitt. However, that being said, we thoroughly enjoyed it. We paid 3.99 to stream it on a saturday night eating takeout on our couch, which after a long hard week at work, was the best way to spend Saturday night. So in that respect, we were very pleased. My husband did say that if he saw it at a movie theater, he still would have been satisfied because he never expected it to be a fantastic A+ type of movie. Maybe that's the problem with some<br /> people, especially after paying 11-20 bucks for a movie ticket, 5 bucks on a soda and 9 bucks on popcorn, you kind of expect more than some movies are able to give. Ben Stiller was enjoyable, Casey Affleck is always fun, really loved Matthew Broderick and we really enjoyed the way everything played out. It was a just go with it kind of movie that you can just have fun with.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is the first time I've tried nonograms, but I do love logic puzzles. If you're in the same boat, give this app a try. There's a nice, clear interface and a lot of puzzles at different levels of skill to enjoy.<br /><br />Now that I know I like this sort of puzzle, I'm off to look for other nonograms!
