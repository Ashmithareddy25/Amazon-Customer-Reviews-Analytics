B005EHNEDO|4.0|Why is it that we, as a society, subscribe to the meme that an artist's early work is always the best? It's hardly ever true. Who can honestly say that [[ASIN:B0025KVLRO Please Please Me (Remastered)]] is better than [[ASIN:B0025KVLT2 Rubber Soul (Remastered)]]? Artists are supposed to change and grow.<br /><br />Wilco does that. They move forward with every album. Yes, [[ASIN:B00007JTM9 Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]] is the one they'll be remembered for, much like Pink Floyd is remembered for [[ASIN:B000002U82 Dark Side of the Moon]]. But that's no reason to dismiss later efforts.<br /><br />I find that each of their records is enjoyable on its own merits. \\"The Whole Love\\", in my opinion, is their strongest work since YHF, and possibly its near equal. This is definitely a more dynamic album than a couple of their earlier efforts, and something of a return to form for the band. \\"Art of Almost\\" resembles YHF in its endearing weirdness. \\"I Might\\" is shockingly upbeat for Wilco, and I find myself listening to it on repeat for the way the organ hovers above the noise. \\"Dawned On Me\\" finds the band channeling their inner pop group, and \\"Born Alone\\" finds Tweedy channeling his inner Tom Petty (via early 70's glam).<br /><br />\\"Open Mind\\" reminds me of one of those slow-moving, late-era Dylan blues songs with a startlingly lyrical lead guitar that fills the empty space between verse and chorus and a classic Tweedy vocal. The title track is catchy and fun to listen to, while \\"One Sunday Morning\\" is a phenomenal closer, mirroring a classic folk melody I can't place, and it shows that Wilco can still out-indie today's so-called indie bands.<br /><br />I think it's time for some of Wilco's fans to catch up with the band. Why should they remake YHF every 3 or 4 years? Get with it, people- it's 2011 (for a little while, yet). Just because you prefer one or another era of this or that band is no reason to dismiss 50% of their catalogue. \\"The Whole Love\\" is a great record, and if you enjoyed Yankee or \\"A Ghost Is Born\\" you'll love this one, too.ove this one, too.
B0017SWSCW|4.0|but once you get into it, very hard to put down.  I think the author spends a bit too much time setting the stage for the main plot, which is fascinating.  It is about truth, transformation, and ultimately justice for those who committed a crime and then framed an innocent man for it.  This is one I'd like to see a sequel to ... to find out what happens next to \\"the good guys.\\"
B005H1SDQU|5.0|Steve Hackett does it again. Another piece of great music. There is a variety of music from solid rock to melodic stuff. I am always pumped when I hear of new music coming from Mr. Hackett and have yet to be dissapointed.
B0058A119G|5.0|Ooh! I'm loving Barbra's new album. The Bergmans are renowned for lush, romantic ballads, and, well, so is Barbra; I can't understand why some people would find fault with that -- especially fans. Barbra's voice sounds magnificent! This selection of tunes is like a soft, warm sweater on a chilly autumn evening. Mellow, enveloping arrangements draw one into the sense of a gentle musical caress. Barbra's interpretations reflect her age -- and our age as fans for, obviously, fifty years. I wouldn't want to hear her bang out any of the teeny-bob junk on today's charts. This album is elegant and sophisticated like a fine, aged, single-malt scotch. It's perfect for more mature taste. A suggestion for her next collection: what about Barbra with a big brass band? She wowed us with Lover, Come Back to Me, based on her time with Benny Goodman's band as part her Timeless concert, and now That Face and Nice `n' Easy get me wishing! A dozen songs in big band style with \\"lots of brass\\" would be fun. Oh... I have all of Barbra's albums on my iTunes, so I couldn't resist burning ALL of her songs with the Bergmans on one disc -- and \\"extended\\" disc two. I Googled the list, and now have two hours, fifteen minutes of Barbra/Bergman bliss! One last thing: in Nice `n' Easy, she sings \\"So let's start getting' cozy, The future's lookin' rosy.\\" Could that be a subtle hint to her actually starring as Mama Rose in Gypsy? Hmm...
0316067598|5.0|Others can armchair this all day long from the comfort of their office chairs. Marcus told his story the way *he* saw it.  If you disagree with him that's your right, granted to you by the US Constitution and the millions of Americans who have sworn to defend it.  If you have never witnessed another human being die such a death, let alone your closet friends you have no idea how that would play on your mind.  Is it any wonder that given the outcome of his decision that he feels bitter and angry?  His friends are dead, he had to watch them die and call his name for help.  The people he knew personally who came to save him were massacred and died a horrible death. Later, when seeing the wives and children of those very same friends there had to be a great deal of second guessing his decision and wondering, I'm sure, why he was the Lone Survivor.  He's a brave lad who did a crappy job that very few people have the heart and \\"testosterone\\" to do. He'll most likely need rehabilitation mentally and physically for a long time to come and will get very little monetary reward for his sacrifice.  If he makes a few bucks from his story, good for him.  If he has regrets that color his writing, most of us will understand.  I thank him for the window into the events that occurred and ignore that which I deem to be personal opinion.  Others should learn to do the same.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I'm of Welsh decent and have read the many diffrent tellings of King Arthur, In the time period of Arthur, 400 ad to 500 ad, There were no Knights in Shining Armor, The way the warrior's dress in this season is more correct.  I loved how they did the Lady of the Lake, and the sword excalibur, diffrent but great.  I love the music also, makes me feel like I'm there, brings tears to my eyes.  I hope they make a season 2, it's worth it to me.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|What I truly liked about the movie was how industrious the hero was.  He was doing fine on his own, until he let other people in. As the zombies became  more aggressive and wiser, the real battle started. There was quite a bit of imagination and humor on Will Smith's part. This is one of those movies I could watch over and over.  Don't try to analyse too much, just kick back and be glad you are on this side of the screen.
0062060554|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, and the thought of putting myself in the main character's shoes kind of made me shutter... but in a good way, of course.  I felt that the author's use of such an authentic trauma/medical condition made the story seem more and more real with each chapter. I was so eager to find out how the story would unfold, but yet I found myself trying to refrain from jumping to any conclusions so that the truth of the written words were more of a surprise when I read them. My only complaint is that when I reached the end, I wanted the story to continue on.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I was completely engrossed in this book and could not put it down.  The characters were wonderfully written, every emotion was reflected perfectly.  Ana and Christian both struggle so deperately to be someone they're not to please the other.  Ana and Christian both reflect what we all face in life, wanting something so much and having to decide how much of ourselves we are willing to sacrifice to have it.  At the end I don't know who was sobbing more me or Ana.  While this book does go in depth into alternative life styles it is sooooo much more than that.  I have seen numerous comments about this book having been originally written as Twilight fan fiction and the characters based on Edward and Bella.  While I am sure this is true, do not let this put you off this book if you are not a Twilight fan.  I have read Twilight numerous times and it is just too far of a stretch to think Edward (a virgin) could be into BDSM.  The only comparison I could draw between the two books would be the intensity of the characters feelings and Christian's copper hair.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|Disc1- i dont need this i have my 1973 japanese vinyl  Disc2- wembley 74..i compared it to my bootleg and the biggest difference is you can actually hear the crowd here..SQ is also amazing..great disc!  Disc3&4- whats the point if this... the bluray has all the content of these discs and in higher quality..  Disc5(blu-ray)- awesome... 5.1 mix from 2003 sacd...4.0 mix from 1973 all in lossless...oh and all the concert projections they showed on the screen in 1974 and 1975...wonderful  Disc6- if the 5.1 mix and the 4.0 mix aren't different enough for you then this reject mix of the album is sure to tickle your fancy... it is very different from the final album...this is probably what made the set worth it to me... also the 3 live tracks from brighton 72 sound amazing...i have this full concert on bootleg but this just sounds incredible... they need to release this separately..the whole concert!  the scarf? hmmm maybe ill use it in the winter to look cool lol..  but  Marbles? wth is this..  i really like the replica backstage pass and rainbow theatre ticket...i wish i had the real ones and actually met them backstage at the rainbow theatre :(  the 2 books included...are very nice...if you bought the dsotm regular cd..remember the booklet...well 1 of the books in the boxset has this booklet reproduced but the book is huge compared to the little cd booklet...so this is a nice upgrade of that...not to mention all the rejected DSOTM cover designs..  the 2nd book is just cool photos of the band..its quite good imo... like another reviewer said..if these 2 books were hardcover it would have been icing on the cake..  the coasters...each one is supposed to be some Storm T..sketches..maybe ideas he had for the album..they are ok i guess but ill never use them..
B0041IU1H4|3.0|I think it is more hype about Stevie Ray Vaughan overall carrier than the real quality of his music. He seemingly has all components but something is missing. This SACD is \\"good to have\\" if you are a SACD collector, but basically this is it. It is also overpriced.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes is a surprising mystery/romance with a fresh, endearing main character: Rose. Her voice was so authentic, I followed her willingly at first, and then got stuck--literally stuck--reading to push her further and further through the mystery. I _had_ to know what happened and it kept me up until the wee hours! It's rare that an author can strike such a great balance between heart-pounding suspense (what's in that box?!?!) and a genuine romance. Loved it, then immediately bought Chosen by the same author (and was not disappointed!).
0525423281|5.0|Okay, I thought no YA boy could be better then Etienne, the guy from Stephanie Perkins's first book, \\"Anna and the French Kiss.\\"   Two words.   Cricket Bell.   Oh lawsy. *swoons*   Smart, intelligent romance with heart, and a boy so adorable that you might end up squealing and hugging your Kindle at certain parts like I did.  All I can say is, I can't believe it's the day after the release and I'm already pining for the next book!
B0054NQZ9S|5.0|Never give up there is always a good thing if something \\"BAD\\" happens. America is the land of the free...
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I pre-ordered the movie before it came out for $25 originally with the shipping option that it would get to me on the day of its release date(Sep. 30). The movie went down in price so I got $5 bucks back and I also got the movie delivered personally to me by an agent on the day before it was released (Sep. 29th) so BIG points for that. The disc case comes in a nice looking shielded cover and the product itself includes a Blu-Ray copy, DVD version and a code for a digital version copy which you can get on the website somehow which I haven't tried yet. The movie is beautiful Hi-Def which you would expect from any Blu-Ray movie, which is a real treat in this one when the sparks start flying(and there are many sparks).   The Movie itself should be viewed only as a blockbuster summer flick for entertainment purposes only. If you havent watched this movie yet and are expecting it to be good then you will be utterly dissapointed. This movie has terrible story(tho not as bad as the second one), mediocre acting and the dialogue/humor sometimes is a little awkward and embarrassing(like almost any Michael Bay film these days). The action is great and intense just dont expect good deaths for the bad guys given almost all of them have a very stupid/pathetic death scene given to them regardless of how badass they are in the movie. Megatron, despite how badass he's supposed to be, is punked and pushed around the entire film and not given a proper death. Basically the movie feels a little rushed towards the end and the ending doesnt really feel like an ending more like they just wanted to finish the damm thing already.   Oh and for the idiot people complaining this movie isnt the extended edition and rating it down because of it, learn to read. This is the version that was in theaters not a special edition but I will have to agree with the people complaining about the lack of extras in this disc. There are NONE, which is stupid but then again I got this product for the movie itselfnot to see how they made the damm thing so I got what I expected. They are going to release an extended version of this movie later on this year (around November/December) as well as the 3D version of the movie, which is NOT included in this version so if you want to watch the movie in 3D then you better off waiting for the later version instead.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Lola laughs! you laugh! Lola cries! you cry!! Cricket is that boy that every girl wants!! I'ts such a beautiful story and so well written!! Stephanie Perkins is such a talented writer! I will always be a fan! Definitely five stars!!
160094048X|5.0|This is a great cookbook to have on your shelf if you are vegan, have a lot of vegan friends, or just can't tolerate eggs or dairy. The recipes are delicious and there is a good mix of both basic cookie recipes and more complex, exotic recipes. The Mexican chocolate snickerdoodles are amazingly easy to make and far tastier than many non-vegan cookies I have had. The recipes I tried also freeze well so you can make them in large batches.
B0052GACNM|3.0|I had great hopes.  Who would think anything with Norah Jones wouldn't be wonderful?  They just don't mesh.  Either of the prior two duet discs are much better with Wonderful World with k.d. lang being the the gold standard.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|For the truly Beatles fan this is a must have. Especially the albums With the Beatles, Please please me, A Hard Days Night, Beatles for Sale which originally were released in MONO are released in STEREO in the REMASTERED SERIES. Both sound clean ofcourse. All in all this is a very good set for the money. The sound is excellent and so is the packeging of the box. What's missing is the Beatles Story Album which was part of the American Catalog. All in all the releasing of Beatles material keeps the Beatles fans busy.
B0051T47NQ|1.0|Positives:  Getting people to act as if they're not acting but just being themselves is harder than it looks. If you don't like reading, exercising, or contributing to world peace/health and therefore need to fill time then this flick will do it.   Negatives:  The most creative parts of the movie were the Norwegian mountains which, unfortunately for the Norwegian production crew, they can't take any credit for creating. They can take credit for copycat, anyone can do it, wobbly handheld mockumentary in the long line of Blair etc. redux. The computer generated trolls were pretty standard for today's computer graphics software so if you find them amazing then you must just now be discovering technology. By the way, a note to the educated viewer, it's anatomically impossible to have a creature of that size with that particular skeletal structure (e.g. blood flow pressure; stress forces on bone).
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I was hooked by the first episode!  Episode 1 is on Amazon video-on-demand for free if you're on the fence about buying it.
0439023521|5.0|Wow, just wow! I got this on an acquaintance's recommendation. Was not too sure about a \\"youth book\\". I picked it up lightly one day when I didn't want a book I might actually get into. Whoops. From about page 3 I was lost. Lost to the book. I could not put it down. I was actually bummed I had to go to sleep! I started it later in the evening so technically it took me two days to read this. I cannot wait to get the next two books. Every page is important, there is no useless filler in this book. And talk about a cliffhanger ending! Love this book.
0761944524|5.0|I'm so happy to find this book, I could cry.  I'm taking my first semester of grad school and struggling in stats.  A friend, who flunked her first stats class in grad school told me that because she used this book, she was able to pass stats the second time and go on to be a TA for the class.  I just got it today and I LOVE this book.  It literally makes me laugh through the pain.  I now have hope that I can pass (whereas I didn't before).    Bless you Mr. Field.  You've probably saved me!
0345350472|5.0|This is one of the best fiction novels I have ever read. The book is much better than the Blade Runner movie, because the characters are much more human (even the androids) and they seem to have much more senses of purpose in the book. Definitely recommended.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Now this is coming from a person that hasn't been in love with the Harry Potter series just to let all of you know before you start flaming recklessly. From the trailers that I've seen for this movie it looked like it was going to be epic so i was hoping that this could be the movie that could change how I feel about the franchise, how wrong was I. This film's biggest downfall was its editing, it felt so rushed that it looked like I was watching half a movie. Also the final battle at Hogwarts is so anticlimactic in every way that it put me off, plus its pacing was also problematic even though it is the shortest movie of the series. Though not all was lost like some of the special effects which really shows how much CGI has improved over the years and Alan Rickman who plays Severus Snape was really good in this one(probably the only great thing about this movie), other than that though this movie really disappointed me. I really wanted to like it but that was not going to happen. For the fans they're going to like it regardless but for everyone else be warned. For better finales watch The Lord of the Rings or Star Wars, there much better series anyway.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!!! In fact, it inspired me to tear my house apart and begin the decluttering process. I always wondered why I struggled so much to keep my house clean and why it has always overwhelmed me so much. After reading this book, now I know why: I have TMS (too much stuff)!! I'm not saying I'm going to become as \\"minimal\\" as the author has, but I have definitely found a tremendous amount of inspiration from this book and it has inspired me to literally change the way I live.
B004I11VZA|4.0|Again Donnie Yen does a wonderful job as the quiet, humble (does he ever get angry?) master, this movie does not quite have the same amount of fight scenes as the original and \\"action\\" junkies will be a little disappointed.<br /><br />In a Martial Arts movie final fight scene we always want to see two martial artists \\"going at it\\" for the climax, but alas his opponent here is a boxer, coupled with the no footwork allowed rule,  and the blatant Rocky IV rip off, down to a microphone being shoved in front of Ip man after his victory to make a speech through a translator. I almost expected to hear:<br /><br />\\"I came here tonight...and I didn't know what to expect.<br /> I've seen a lot of people hating me...<br /> and I didn't know what to feel about that, so...<br /> I guess I didn't  like you much either..........\\"<br /><br />It was a little bit of a letdown<br /><br />Otherwise decent Job
0553801473|1.0|After getting \\"hooked\\" on the first 3 novels, I must say the 4th and now the 5th, were increasingly disappointing.  I won't be reading a 6th.  GRRM can be a masterful story-teller, but now, looks like he's resting on his laurels, and just churning for sales.  Won't work George - I really don't care now what happens to any of the characters I came to care so passionately about in the first 3 novels.  What a huge disappointment.
B00319ECGU|5.0|I had previously written that it was an awful deal as Amazon had the price at $60+, this seems to have been addressed.<br /><br />I will not speak about the movies as they are all excellent to an Fan and the quality is \\"Bluray\\" standard, and get progressively better on each disc.<br /><br />I wish to add that even though the<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001608QVS Dirty Harry Ultimate Collectors's edition]]<br /><br />Has loads of extras including wallet ID etc, please do not think THIS box set is just movies...<br /><br />On the Dirty Harry disc there are loads of extras including a series of retrospectives<br /><br />* The long shadow of Dirty Harry<br />* Clint Eastwood out of the Shadows<br />* Profile Clint Eastwood- Man from Malpaso<br /><br />Interviews, (including interviews with Shane Black-writer of Lethal Weapon, David Ayer- writer of Training Day) Featurettes \\"Dirty Harry's Way and Dirty Harry.<br /><br />Each disc has a commentary by Richard Schickel- critic or by writers, the extras are also not restricted to the Dirty harry disc.<br /><br />Magnum Force- A moral right?-The politics of Dirty Harry and the Hero Cop<br /><br />The Enforcer- The business end: Violence in Cinema+ Clint Eastwood something special in films<br /><br />Sudden Impact- The Evolution of Clint Eastwood<br /><br />The Dead Pool- The craft of Dirty Harry<br /><br />Lastly- There are several interviews by actors on working with Clint Eastwood in the films which I found very interesting:<br /><br />e.g Hal Holbrook who played SFPD Homicide Lt.

0062060554|2.0|Firstly my review must be tempered by the fact that I didn't finish the book - because I couldn't. I understand this is the author's first crack, but that doesn't mean I want to read weak, cliched writing. Others have written in more detail, but suffice to say the contrived plot and the ridiculous first person narrative in the journal entries make this novel hard to take. My wife finished the book and said that it eventually worked as a thriller but even she said that it was a hard slog. This could have been brilliant if he was a real writer and if he could have stayed away from first person.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|amazon.co.uk has the three different HP movies 1-8 sets  just go to the site and type in \\"harry potter 1-8\\"  ALLL BLU RAY CUSTOMERS can order, as these are region free and with HD media, there is no such thing as PAL encoding.  \\"Harry Potter - The Complete 8-Film Collection [Blu-ray] [2011][Region Free]\\"  and \\"Harry Potter: The Complete 1-8 Film Collection - Limited Numbered Edition (Blu-ray + DVD) [2011][Region Free]\\"  I live in philly, i ordered the regular set, its going to come to around 40 bucks i believe  the special edition version will be way less than 100 and far surpasses this version sold here  the dvd set is SUPER cheap but it is not region free and it IS in PAL. so most americans wont be able to see it  this is true for most of amazon.co.uk 's inventory. as far as blu ray, as long as it says region free, it will work in america, and it only takes a week to get here, and it is ALWAYS cheaper. and they have WAY more unique box sets and artwork.
B000058983|5.0|Sometimes people say the same thing so often that it becomes potentially stale hyperbole, a cliche.  In this case the cliche is true. Forever Changes is quite simply one of the greatest albums ever recorded and one of the finest artistic accomplishments of its generation.  I was lucky enough to experience the Sixties as a teenager in the Boston area, and we were blessed with a great radio station, WBCN, which used to play cuts from this album constantly. FC hit us hard when it was released, it was as omnipresent as late Beatles and Doors stuff... If I can mangle the language for a second, nobody didn't know Forever Changes. It was in the air for quite a while, years in fact.  It thrills me that so many young listeners are singing the praises of this album. I've always assumed that to truly appreciate it you had to be able to relive the innocence, the joy and most importantly the fear we all lived through in those years, but I'm happy to be wrong. (Those years were everything you think they were, a blast, but what seldom gets discussed is that for all of our boldness, we were scared. There was, every single day, a veil of fear that hung over those of us of draft age - and the women in our lives. It may seem romantic to face a decision between going off to war, going underground, going to jail or leaving the country, but it wasn't romantic. I for one was scared to death half the time.)   When we used to sit around our living rooms arguing about who the greatest lead guitarist was, we never mentioned Jimi Hendrix, because it was a given, he was a musician from another dimension, he was his own category. When we'd talk about who our favorite bands were, nobody but nobody mentioned the Beatles because it was a given, they were functioning on an entirely different level, they were Gods. They were oxygen.  The same thing is true with Forever Changes. When I discuss all this stuff with friends old and young, when we talk about the greatest albums of all time, I often forgetto mention this masterpiece...  Because it isn't an album. It's Forever Changes.
0553801503|2.0|You are invested in the series.  You need to read this book because things are developing, and you don't want to miss out.  This book will barely hold your attention, yet you will slog on, so that went the next book comes out you can read it.  I read the previous three books in a week.  This is the shortest of the series and it took a month.  Looking forward to the next just so it can talk about characters I actually care about.
1400079144|1.0|I am halfway through this book and am totally and utterly bored. I had no motivation to finish it being how slow and boring it is so I looked through the reviews and found out through spoilers what happens. Thank goodness I didn't waste some more nights reading this drivel.  Save your money or if you feel like you want to try and get through it, head to your library and borrow it.   It's sad really as I really enjoyed his other books. I feel that he just threw this one together for some more money while his iron was still hot.
0439023521|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Written in first person present tense (a personal favorite) it grabs you from the start and literally drags you to the end.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" speculates a future where twelve districts are held under the iron fist of the nation's capital, called only \\"The Capital.\\" To remind the districts of their subservience, every year two children from each is chosen to fight in a gladiatorial and televised Hunger Games. There is only one survivor.<br /><br />Obviously, this \\"man as prey\\" premise has been done before, many times. The first story I remember reading was Richard Connell's \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" but the most popular is doubtless Stephen King's \\"The Running Man.\\" Collins's brings a new twist to the genre, though, because the main protagonist is female. (And essentially a child.)<br /><br />I give the author credit for making the role of her heroine believable. Katniss doesn't try to go toe-to-toe with the men in the competition (like heroines in movies often do). She relies on her cunning and skill, as do all the female competitors.<br /><br />There were a few things in the book that gave me pause, though. First off, the premise. Most parents I know would fight to the death to keep their own children from harm. So I wonder if a society that has resigned itself to willingly giving up its children every year, for a televised blood bath, is plausible. It is arguable, given some of the realities of our society that children (and human life) are valued less than they used to be...but allowing a 12-year-old to fend for herself against young men with knives and spears...I don't know...<br /><br />The other thing I wondered about is the competitors' final adversaries. That portion of the book actually made me cry \\"what!\\" because it seemed a giant speculative leap. I won't delve on this any longer for fear of spoiling something. But it was certainly a surprise.<br /><br />Overall, though, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a great book. Enjoyable reading. And the eBook version I read was clean and easy to navigate. Well done!y to navigate. Well done!
B005D9MUWY|3.0|This keyboard is good, but in a few apps it totally freaks out.  Google Docs is a good example. It just fills up the screen by repeating the same thing over and over.
0375758992|4.0|Only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was - i had a bit of trouble following the timeline at times - but that could just be ME.<br /><br />It's an amazing book and story - heartwarming, heartwrenching - you will laugh and you will cry.  Sounds corny but it's true.  Very nicely written - with the details not always being NICE ones.  This is someone's LIFE, how can anyone 'dislike' the story of it?<br /><br />I loved the descriptions of the parts of Africa, the places the lives, the animals (especially theirs'!), and i really felt for them during their trying times.  I was so anxious to find out who this woman grows up to be that i almost Googled her before i finished the book ... just to find out more about her (but i waited).<br /><br />I found it a very enjoyable memoir of a family life that was far from perfect - if you can handle reading about things like this (ie. real life), life growing up in a country with far less 'luxuries' than most are used to (clean water), and how the family makes it thru together - I think you will love this book like i did.
0307454541|5.0|I fully appreciate the posthumous genius of Stieg Larsson. His books are exciting, suspenseful, and keep you guessing. Lisbeth Salander is one of the great characters of our time, unforgettable & edgy. I confess I don't really like the movies, and probably won't care for the US version either, but I usually don't like the film adaptations as much as the novels.<br /><br />Long live Stieg's memory!
B005G4TJI4|2.0|I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .  It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit.  There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.  Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.  If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one.
0061474355|4.0|Let me start off by saying that if your readers have trouble gaining a clear understanding of the pronunciation of the main character's name, they are confused and will probably stay that way.  Is it sah-BREE-elle or SAY-bree-elle?<br /><br />I would not have finished this book had my husband (who read it as a teen) not been prodding me to at least get to \\"X\\" part or when \\"Y\\" happens.  Even still, these more interesting things happen well into the second half of the book.  The first part is about as interesting as watching someone jog on a treadmill because that is what it feels like Sabriel is doing:  she runs from one place to the next to find her father's body and release him from Death.  Only she doesn't seem to have any strong emotion or logic.  She's running.  She's being chased.  She's in danger.  She's safe.<br /><br />By the time Nix does get around to injecting some emotion, he does it in the most random of places.  Why would Sabriel all of a sudden ask the Clayr silly questions if the band of bad guys is right behind her?<br /><br />There are some other sloppy first-novel issues that crop up.  There are a few instances of \\"oops, I forgot to mention the spells don't bind us on water\\" type things.  Which are just a disservice to your reader.  And since Nix does head hop a little, at least use it to the reader's benefit and give us more inner monologue with feelings and confessions of the characters.<br /><br />What I can appreciate about the book though was that Sabriel is at least a female lead that doesn't become woefully sucked into the drama of high school romances.  Yes, there's danger and romance sort of shoved together for an intriguing mixture, but never does Sabriel become weakened by her feelings of attraction.  And she can kick butt.  Nix didn't cop out and have Sabriel faint or end up waking up with everything resolved or the bad guys just backing down.  There's an epic scene where we need an epic scene.  It's already Hollywoodified for a screenplay.<br /><br />The other thing that I think works well is Nix's world-building.  Fantasy is difficult with the immense amount of prep that is needed at the beginning of a series.  I'm not a regular fantasy reader, but I was able to understand pretty quickly and slip into the believability of the world and the idea of bells and whistles binding magical creatures.<br /><br />And Sabriel was pretty fun, which counts for a lot.<br /><br />Would I recommend it?  Probably to an advanced teen (keep in mind the vocabulary is pretty elevated and Nix is Australian, so sometimes if I didn't know a word I assumed it was Aussie strangeness not my own ignorance) who loved fantasy and magic series.s well is Nix's world-building.

0143038419|4.0|This is a warm, wonderful story of a woman in search of herself/God. I loved the way this story unfolds! Elizabeth Gilbert is such a courageous woman to share herself and her awakening with the rest of us. I truly appreciate her willingness to be open and honest through this book. Not only was Eat, Pray, Love delightful and fun to read, but I found it to be an inspiration as well!

0060730552|4.0|Wow, absolutely amazing book.  I give this book 4 1/2 stars.  Took 1/2 star off due to the dry climbing jargon at the beginning of the book.  I had to push myself through.  But after Joe broke his leg, the book flew by.  From that point on, Simon's point of view was also inserted (written by Joe).  The author captured so well the absolute despair, hopelessness, grief, and guilt mixed with the emotional and physical will to survive and the deep understanding between two mountaineering friends.  I was absolutely exhausted at the end of the book.  Joe also does not question Simon's action of cutting the rope.  In fact, he supports it.  While I believe this is a huge ethical issue in the climbing circle, Joe and Simon simply present it as a survival fact - cut the rope and one lives; don't cut the rope and both die.  In my mind, it's simple math, but I am no mountaineer!
B00000AF95|3.0|now a follow up 2 lick it up would be difficult after departure of Vinnie V.

B005I547ZG|4.0|Harry Bosch is, for me, like an old friend. I really love this tough guy.<br /><br />Since his last book was Nine Dragons, 2009 (I know, there's the Reversal, 2010, but I feel this more like a Mickey Haller than a Bosch book...), I missed him a lot.<br /><br />This is why I'm giving this collection of short stories four stars... I don't know when they were written, but I have to tell you they did not seem like the usual Connelly. There is a certain amateurism, specially in the first story - which names the book. I almost laugh at one particular point, with this tacky, cliche sentence:<br /><br />\\"Someone had picked this flower just as it had been about the bloom.\\"<br /><br />The second story is a little better, although being told in first person, which still feels weird when it comes to Bosch, at least for me (the two books where he is retired and kind of private-eyeing are not my favorites exactly because of the first person style, despite the good plots).<br /><br />The last story is actually really good and there I felt I was reading a classic Harry Bosch. It's also the longest one.<br /><br />All in all it is a good buy. After all, it's always great to read about Bosch!
B005ELZKWS|4.0|I was some what disappointed with Satch's contribution to the last album... He more then makes up for it with this album. Homeboy tears it up!  Sammy's voice and writing are A LOT better on this album. This is the best I've heard him sound since For 'Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.'    Mikey's voice is put to much better use. But his bass is pretty low in the mix.  This is the most reserved playing I've heard out of Chad. Thats not say it's a bad thing, though - perhaps reserved is a bad word. Soulful is probably better.   You can tell they actually took their time with each song and got it just right. I'm a huge fan of Sammy and Satch, they were the first two concerts I attended(in that order), and I can honestly say this is the best album Sammy, and Mikey for that matter, have been apart of since \\"Balance.\\"  Satch clearly can't go full blown in the bad setting but like I said earlier he's A LOT better on this album. I can't really say that much about Chad as I don't really like the Chili Peppers, Sorry, but I heard that \\"Californication\\" song WAY to much on radio. So I don't have that strong of a point of reference for Chad Smith.    1. Last Temptation - A hard driven rocker with a catchy hook. In the opening bar Satch lets it be known that he's come to play. 4/5  2. Alright Alright - Don't know how to explain this one - kinda Cajunesque. Weakest song on the album 2/5   3. Different Devil - The hooky Power Ballad of the record. Man, it's so good to hear Mikey's voice in a chorus again, where it belongs! 4/5   4. Up Next - Riffy rocker - Satch excels on this one. But if your not into the guitar I could see how you wouldn't like this one. 3/5  5. Come Closer - Retrospective--relationship's hardships ballad. Good writing with a cool solo and bridge. Not really feeling it though. 3/5    6. Three And A Half Letters - A gritty-heartfelt anthem for the down on their luck. Just for the fact that these are millionaires who actually see the world around them, plus a helluva soloby Satch I give this 5/5   7. Big Foot - Hard driving-forget your problems rocker. Awesome riff + Catchy hook = 4/5  8. Dubai Blues - Riffy unrequited-love rocker. Awesome opening riff from Mikey. Cool solo from Satch. Stupid premise but it's catchy. 3/5  9.Something Going Wrong - Don't really know how to explain this song other then it's the best on the album... I know, weird, right? 5/5  10. The I'm fed up rocker. Catchy riff. This is probably the most explosive Chad gets. I don't know how to read this song. I mean as a song it's 3/5. But with the content it makes it more substantial. When listing to it I found my self saying \\"yeah they did\\" after every verse. So as a song 3/5 as a somewhat political stance that will surely cost them many fans 4/5     All in all it's a much better album, then the first one. It's a rare treat to hear four world class musicians on the top of their game... Very rare!  Two other thoughts.  1) You DLR fans really need to move on with your lives and get over it. Come, on it's been 26 years. Besides he's back in the band, I guess, if you want to call a group of guys who only tour on songs that they wrote 25+ years ago a band. An \\"oldies band\\" I guess.  2) To those mad Sammy brought up \\"them lying about Obama\\" it might surprise you to know that he's been a registered Republican since the early 80's. I know it shocked me!
B004X4RU9I|2.0|In one scene, Ip Man (YIP Man) fights off 20-30 people with machetes and in other a westerner who plays the sport of boxing gives him a run for the money!! It cannot make sense to anyone even with a peanut for brains. They create a whole drama of Chinese Kung Fu vs western Boxing. One is a martial art honed over 1000s of years while the other is a sport. And in the end, they call both forms of fighting almost equal!! It is simply ridiculous.   Below average movie in all regards.

0061478784|5.0|The story is a fun read for adults and kids. It is different enough from the movie that you will not know what to expect after having seen the animated film. I loved both the movie and the book.
B003ZHVJFK|2.0|If you're willing to let your brain fall asleep on the multiple plot holes, sub-par acting,  and so-so story then the movie will be o.k. but expect anything else and all you're going to be is annoyed.  While the movie gives us some of the characters of the video game series a lot of them are short cameos or just don't look like them at all but again the same can be said with the Van Damme game movie Street Fighter another guilty pleasure.  While the cast weren't the worse I've ever seen a lot of them were just miscast for their roles which didn't really fit them at all,  another problem was the choreography of some of the fight scenes while some were decent others were just atrocious but again we would then come back to the live action version of SF(And to a lesser point the two Mortal Kombat Movies).  If you're a fan of the game series then this movie is worth getting if for anything else a guilty pleasure of seeing the live action version of all iconic fighting characters until the CGI movie comes out this November,  but again keep your expectations of this movie low or otherwise all your going to feel afterwords is throwing this into the garbage disposer....

B005DKLPF6|4.0|\\"I burned out my eyes / I cut off my tongue / I sealed it with all of the silver / and now I have none / you killed the life / you took the diamonds / you killed the vine\\" are the first utterances growled on Mastodon's fifth offering of dense, turbo-charged metal, suggesting a pair of elves are about to do battle. Which might sound strange to some, but to those initiated in the band's tactical, brutal assault on the senses, such images are par for the course.<br /><br />After all, the Atlanta band's previous album, 2009's \\"Crack the Skye,\\" followed the adventures of a quadriplegic who learned astral projection. On this outing, song titles include \\"Blasteroid,\\" \\"Stargasm\\" and, perhaps most telling, the Sid and Marty Krofftian \\"Octopus Has No Friends.\\" I imagine it all makes perfect sense if you're getting your daily dose of medical marijuana or spend enough time playing video games.<br /><br />None of which probably comes as a big surprise, this being stoner metal. But those who can get past the Viking lore and D&D underpinnings are treated to a mind-blistering sonic quest. The surprises come from the nuances in the vocal interplay between the three leads and the experimentation taking place between the big riffs. Consider \\"Thickening,\\" which kicks off with bassist Troy Sanders setting down a sprightly tempo, as the other players chime in, the music moving from weepy metal to Woody Guthrie to math rock before finally settling down inside Monster Magnet territory.<br /><br />To be sure, all four musicians are masters of the Metal Handbook, applying tricks like the obligatory Extended Guitar Solo and the lip-quivering Introspective Ballad. Where Mastodon differs is in its courage to flirt with other genres such as prog and jazz rock.<br /><br />While \\"Creature Lives\\" begins with an annoying rip-off of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" it is an otherwise interesting foray in spacey, anthem metal that carries hints of Queen. Drummer Brann Dailor tries to see eye to eye with Rush's Neil Peart on the scorching \\"All the Heavy Lifting,\\" employing bunny-hopping time signatures at a breakneck jaunt.<br /><br />There are enough brain-bruising entries -- such as the relentlessly swaggering \\"Spectrelight,\\" guest-starring Neurosis' Scott Kelly -- to appeal to Metallica and Slayer loyalists, but there's plenty of room for gentler folks who prefer Muse, Alice in Chains or Thin Lizzy.ng \\"All the Heavy Lifting,\\" employing bunny-hopping time signatures at a breakneck jaunt.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|Interesting but to slow for me. About an hour in I was looking at the time going \\"really another hour of this still\\". The case he's on is pretty strange too. It deals with a satanic priest who comes back from the dead and all kinds of strange things.
0345529057|5.0|First, I was a little suspicious to wheather the quality would be OK purchasing this set.   When received, I found it to be OK: no skew printing, no pages falling out, only the ink fades little when extensivly rubbing the paper. The story is as thrilling and good as I have expected to be. So this was a well spent couple of Euro's.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I'm not sure how this album didn't get a grammy. I would be hard pressed to think of a better overall album in 2010. There is not a bad song in the bunch. I compare it to some of my favorite Rolling Stones records. It takes those old blues forms and transforms them into something new and fresh. At times i heard direct influences from the Stones' \\"Tattoo You\\" album. It's not as raw as their early stuff but having said that I don't think it's overly produced either. I bought this on double vinyl and it came with a cool poster and cd not a download voucher like most do. Well worth the money. Way to go Black Keys! Keep up the great work, you are keeping rock-n-roll alive!
0345529057|4.0|I just got my box set in the mail a few days ago, I have read 325 pages of the first book and have inspected all of the books. I have not had any problems with the books in general, all the pages are their that I could see at this time, none of the pages are falling out during reading. I did have one problem which for me was not much of a problem but for a collector may not like it. The decorated box that the book are held it is thin and crappy, all four books weight close to 4lbs if not more, the box is not strong enough for them. When I open the packaging that the box set was shipped in I noticed that one of the top corner of the box that the book are in was ripped, I was going to tape it but as I look at all of the books when I put them back into the box the bottom corner of the collector box ripped. I believe the collector box should of be made a bit thicker so it would not rip and beable to hold the weight of the books. Also with all four books in the collectors box its pretty tight, should of had just a bit of more space so that they could be removed from the box easier.     Other then that I had no other problems that I know of, Like I said earlier I have only read the first 300 pages of the first book, but I did inspected them and the books look to be in great quality.     I also want to point out that what I have read already I can tell that I will love the story a lot. So far the story has been very great and exciting and interactive in a way. I hear that some liked the first two books but then afterwards it goes down hill from there but I can't say anything about that yet. Now some complain about that Mr. Martin likes to kill off main characters that they grew to love, so far I have not gotten that far but I don't think that will be much of a problem cause its more of reality, nobody in life is guaranteed to live a long life and or forever. But I don't want to get into a book report cause this review is more about the product then the story in the books.     Thank you for reading my review, I hoped I helped you to decided if this is the set for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I want to start off by saying this, i love this book!!!!! i first read this book for a book report last year. i remember the times when i absolutly had to put the book down, when i ate, when i slept, and during school i felt a longing to read more. now as i read it again a year later i feel the same way...like i just have to finish it. i can compare this only to when i started reading harry potter. very few things give me that feeling and the ones that do usally stick with me.<br /><br />Another thing about this book is the characters. suzanne collins makes it so easy to fall in love with characters after just one page. this book is one that will fill you with a need for more. it will make you laugh,cry,and really feel for the characters.<br /><br />so if your looking for a quick good read the hunger games is a must
B0026S1XDM|5.0|Tubular Bells was my first foray into Progressive music, and it has stayed with me ever since. I originally owned it on vinyl. That collection is long gone. I've been listening to music via MP3 and computer of late, so when I dug out and updated my old hi-fi equipment; I re-learned how enjoyable music is: straight from the CD. So I went in pursuit of Tubular Bells. Don't give the 2003 version a look - its horrific (somehow John Cleese does not add anything positive). Search for an original 1973 and in the US at least you'll pay close to $100. So enter the 2009 Deluxe Edition. I listened with joy to the original 1973 mix and relived my earlier pleasure. Only it was better, courtesy of some better Hi-Fi components.<br /><br />Then I listened to the 2009 re-mastered version. It's good. Very good. But for me personally; a little clinical. In the original mix, we hear Mike's breathing during some of the acoustic guitar passages. That's gone from the 2009 version, and somehow I miss it. The bells also seem somehow different and ring 'not true'. I'll stick with the original, and here's the beauty of this disc. Whether you are returning to Tubular Bells, or listening for the first time: you'll find a version on this disc that meets your needs. I haven't tried the 5.1 version, but for those with a good system then I would bet that it's very worth a listen.<br /><br />I also enjoy TB II and TB III, but if you have to own just one disc: this is the one to buy.

Why they didnt just release it now and make millions of fans happy is beyond me. Such a great series of movies with such a horrible release of the entire series. Should have been a no brainer.
0393064476|3.0|I found the material about Lucretius very interesting, although I have to wonder if he was as central to Renaissance thinking as the author would have us believe. At UC Berkeley, I studied with one of the top scholars on Renaissance Italy and Lucretius was not on the intellectual agenda, although the many Renaissance humanists the author discusses certainly were.  I enjoyed the author's discussion of the transmission of books, the scribal tradition, etc. which is a big part of the first half of the book.  Meanwhile, a NYT reviewer describes this work as \\"a warm, intimate book, a volume of apple-cheeked popular intellectual history\\" and \\"cordial.\\"  But, I'm afraid I cannot agree with that.  I think the book is marred by virulent anti-Catholicism, with constant references to \\"lazy monks,\\" \\"rapacious priests,\\" etc.  Such might fit the polemic of Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, but I found it jarring in this kind of book.  A less tendentious narrative would have been better, leaving the reader to come to his or her own conclusions.

0321344758|5.0|This book was required reading for a Web Analytics class. I found it a fast read because the author writes in a down-to-earth, conversational way with lots of humorous and informative footnotes. He supplies the reader with loads of usable information and realistic examples. For once, I actually took a book to the computer to look up the author's website (and bookmarked it!) as well as other experts' sites and books referenced by Steve. Now I find myself scrutinizing sites I visit with an eye for usability and not just design. This book has been a great help in making me feel that I can actually be a successful and competent web designer.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|If you're looking for an rpg that's well written this rpg probably isn't for you. The dialogue is not well written at all, unless it was written by a 10 year old. The gameplay itself is alright. If you want something to pass the time, and can't find something else that interests you for some reason, it's not a complete waste of time and money.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|This is really a price grouch, not a critical analysis of the book. I enjoyed the story as I almost always do. Lee Child is a marvelous story teller, and his character, Jack Reacher, is compelling.  The price of acquiring the story on Kindle is, in a word, offensive. How can the cost of a hard cover be $14.74, and the cost of the electronic version be $13.99? There is a discrepancy somewhere. Someone, probably Kindle users, are paying a premium for the decline in profit from other media. It is too bad that Amazon was unable to hold its $9.99 price point for such books. The market will work eventually, but the process is annoying at times.
0385344325|2.0|I fear that Lee Child fans, as I am, are going to find his latest Reacher novel a disappointment. I don't know whether it is because he is spending less than a year creating new books or some other reason, this book lacks the plot intrigue and character development that make most of his previous books so entertaining. In this book he even introduces gratuitous thugs just so he can beat them up, and even his fight scenes are subpar. I was very disappointed, but it won't stop me from ordering hist next novel.

After watching all 6 hours of that for day's in a row, i found it hard to sit down and read the book?<br /><br />But then I got my Kindle, and this was one of the first book I read!  It was great to have the details filled in that the movie left out, and also to have the image of Colin Firth in my head as Mr. Darcy!  I love this book and the A&E version of it! :  I am now 26 years old, so it took me about 14 years for me to finally read the book, but it was well worth it.  I now also own the movie on DVD!!  ;)
B0058VW36U|5.0|I first played the game on my friends iPhone. I ended up liking it so much, it was the first \\"game\\" app I bought for my phone. I've been playing it for over a year now. I always try to go back to each level I finished in a quicker time, resulting in more points. And the little monster is so cute!
0060254920|3.0|This was never one of my favorite books as a child, and I recently bought a copy just to see what I think 20 years later. I still don't really care for it, and don't like the idea of having somewhat scary pictures of monsters in a childrens' book that's meant to be read before the child goes to bed. It's tastefully done and the illustrations are cute, but I will never understand why this book has a Caldecott Medal and why so many people rave about it. I guess to each his/her own.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|So I have finally had the time to watch all 6 movies, and the video quality is stunning, the remastering of the older films and the production of the new ones was excellent, with the audio quality up there with some of the best I've heard...<br />Now to the reason why so many people give a 1 star rating before actually seeing the changes...<br /><br />Yes, there were changes, some I noticed, some I didn't...  for example I thought the Ewok's looked more lifelike, and some of the visual changes made decent sense...  As far as the \\"Nooooo!\\" scene, I honestly didn't think it hurt the film.  I don't think it was a required change, I would maybe not have added it due to the purist complaints, but honestly in the original 3 movies it would have been a bit weird to have the Nooooo! in it, but in context, and the fact we now have the visual back story leading up to the death of the emperor and who Vader is, the Noooo! doesn't take anything away, I don't think it adds much of anything, but it doesn't hurt the film...<br /><br />All in all, I am a star wars fan, not die hard but I love the movies, originals and remastered with changes...  I can't complain about the quality or honestly even the changes...  so I will stick to a 5 star rating due to the quality of the movies, and of course the audio and visuals quality seen on the Blu Rays....<br /><br />And honestly I have a 1080p THX certified projector and the colors, while emphasized, never bloomed out on me, nor did they seem completely unrealistic... I watched with several true purists who know the films second by second, and they while disappointed with some of the changes, said they still want to get the blu ray because of how great it makes the movies look.  They just might do it \\"Second hand\\" so they can show they like the movies, but still want to see the unedited originals brought out in blu ray...

1594744769|3.0|I was very curious about this book & was pleasantly surprised to be reading a story from a boy's point of view. It has a bit of snark & a somewhat interesting story, but without all the extraordinary photos, I don't think this book would have gotten half the interest it has.  I enjoyed reading the description of the photo & then getting to closely examine the photo itself, but it makes me wonder which came first, the photo or the story? Did the author write the story & then search for photos to go with it? Or is this entire book written based on specific photos? If it's the latter, then that may be this book's downfall because there were no pictures of the monsters, & that's where things got kind of boring in my opinion. I found the hollows & wights & how they got to be them to be kind of silly. Out of all the enemies that could have been thought of, creatures who eat peculiar children to turn themselves into wights is just kind of....lame. Also confusing since I really didn't understand how they planned on taking over the world. I just wish some of the imagination used to think up the children had been used for the bad guys too.  I'm guessing by the way the story ended that this is the first of a series. I'm not sure if I'll read a sequel, I don't feel like there is anything more to add to this story except maybe more photographs.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Although this book is fiction, it taps into real life events that occurred I France during WWII. I cried thru numerous pars of this book and smiled thru others. As I know survivors of the death camps, this book really tugged at my heart.
0962477060|5.0|As is my usual MO, I have not finished reading this book.  I collect guitars but don't play much and the fretboard makes no sense to me.  I thought this author would provide a more logical way of looking at the musical structure of the guitar fretboard.  So far this book does provide a different and logical way of \\"seeing\\" the design of the fretboard and that is something my mind can grasp.  Again, not finished but so far the book is providing me a different and comforting way of playing my guitars.

B0054N73EY|4.0|When John Frusciante quit the band I thought the RHCP might be done. When I heard the new guitar player was Josh Klinghoffer, I became cautiously optimistic... Josh played brilliantly with the Peppers on the Stadium Arcadium tour, and his work with John Frusciante and Joe Lally [among many others like Beck, The Black Keys, Warpaint, etc] was intense, beautiful, and original. After listening to &quot;I'm With You&quot; for a few months now, I am soooooooo relieved that the RHCP are not just alive, they are alive and well. This is a superb beginning to hopefully many more chapters in RHCP artistic contributions to the world. New, different, original yet familiar, energetic, lovely, multi-rhythmic, psychedelic sex-funk. Yes!

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|In spite of Pink Floyd's reputation, don't come into this movie looking for escape. While the film's animation, music, and depth of message can not be beat, newer movies with lots of random \\"Hey wasn't that actor also in _____?\\" moments are better for distracting the mind.<br /><br />The Wall is a journey into the darker sides of society. It shows us Pink, a rock-star who is disillusioned with everything our society has to offer and represses all desire for human connection. The cycle of disillusionment, alienation, and oppression unfolds.<br /><br />The movie begins by contrasting an audience coming to see Pink in concert with images of soldiers in WWII. The effect is anti-movie as much as anti-war. Mass media brainwashes us into conformity as much as the army indoctrinates soldiers.<br /><br />The movie then takes us through the chronology of Pink's life. The death of his father in battle leaves a big gap in his family life and also a distrust of government, which he represses in order to fit in with other boys his age.<br /><br />In one scene, a young Pink finds his daddy's military uniform one day, tries it on, and salutes his image in the mirror, as the soundtrack plays When the Tigers Broke Free.<br /><br />Next comes education. A particularly harsh schoolmaster repeatedly belittles Pink in front of the class, which participates in his ridicule out of their fear of the master's paddle. The harshness of the schoolmaster underlies the larger industrial purpose of modern education--the sorting of children into specialized economic roles. Roger Waters encapsulates the industrial attitude toward people in the chorus \\"All in all you're just another brick in the wall.\\"<br /><br />The final step is marriage. While Pink becomes a successful musician, he is often inattentive to his wife, more interested in sitting at the piano keyboard than attending social functions, and looking over her at the TV as she tries to be romantic in bed. When she is inevitably driven away, and no longer answers his phone calls, Pink's wall is complete.<br /><br />We begin to see the dark side of celebrity. Pink willingly participates in the music concerts, even though he feels the music industry is just another authoritarian social institution, offering no authentic human connection. Ironically, the only place Pink finds hope for the possibility of authentic connection is TV, but he knows that's not real.<br /><br />Pink's repression has cut him off from all authentic human connection. In what could be argued is the climax of the movie, Pink takes on the identity of the leader of a Neo-political movement and moves his adoring fans to adopt dehumanizing attitudes. Director Alan Parker has the crowd transition into a synchronized march and brilliantly superimposes faceless masks over every member of the audience, illustrating the egoless conformity that crowd behavior brings out in us.<br /><br />At some point in the future, Pink at last yells \\"STOP!\\" and takes time to reflect on what he has become.<br /><br />He then heroically looks into himself, as depicted in \\"The Trial\\". The website A Complete Analysis of Pink Floyd's The Wall says it well:<br />\\"In many ways, 'the Trial' epitomizes all that is the Wall, combining the album's high theatrics, unflinching cynicism,<br />dark humor, tongue-in-cheek irony, deep emotion, and (paradoxically) both unwavering nihilism and steadfast optimism.<br />The song is a seeming contradiction, offering a dichotomous look at the light and dark, good and ill, of Pink's life<br />from a number of different perspectives, all of which take place within the mind of one person.\\"<br /><br />Roger Waters explains, \\"the judge is part of him just as much as all the other characters and things he remembers. They're all in his mind, they're all memories.\\" Although bizarre at first glance, the\\"The Trial\\" is a fitting ending to the multiple themes the film touches on.<br /><br />The Wall, both the album and the movie, is enormous in scope. It's about what concentrations of power and authoritarian social structures do to our souls. For anyone looking to face these deep issues head-on, The Wall offers ample opportunity for reflection.eep issues head-on, The Wall offers ample opportunity for reflection.
B0035WTJFW|4.0|Minority report is one of the my favorit movie. and at the right moment I bought at an economical price considering I already have the previous DVD editions.  contains 2 discs between the film and features. unfortunately I can not slip the cover on this issue.  transfer pictures on minority blu-ray is pretty good I just think there might be even better improvements. soft color depth of black in it was amazing. only there are some scenes I feel need to be polished a little better because different versions of dvdnya.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|By mine mistake, I had not verified the electric frequency of the motor, in this case 60 Hz.  For this reason I had must to pay for conversion to 50 Hz,that is the frequency used in Chile..  Now all is running OK, without troubles..
B004R6JG7G|4.0|lucky I can buy the second edition of Top Gun blu-ray because the price is cheap and the anniversary edition.  The Image of bluray is very good and transfer has increase of dvdnya version. there are only a few scenes still look dirty spots but it is not important.  For those who already have a blu-ray editions beginning probably do not need to upgrade unless you do not have at all and this is the perfect time to upgrade.  a second disc of the blu-ray is one digital copy and the cover slip with it.

B005H1SDQU|5.0|I've followed Steve Hackett's work since he was with Genesis and have just about everything he's ever done on CD or vinyl. All I can say is that Beyond the Shrouded Horizon represents in my view the best album he's made for at least 10 years. It's also an album you should listen to end-end at least once, since Hackett and his team have linked the tracks together beautifully. Highly recommended.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins exposes the centuries of lies that have blinded us to the fact that the morality that preceded the introduction of religion's GODS, was based on what would insure the survival of our species. Religion replaced that morality (the only true morality) with a god designed to scare, control and blind people to the greed and selfishness of those who spread religion e.g. missionaries in the new world.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|UPDATE 1/5/13<br />I've used this for over a year now and have had no problems of any kind.<br /><br />There has been no need to recalibrate.<br /><br />The plastic levers were hit by my chair with no damage.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The quality of the build is much better than I had expected.<br /><br />After reading ALL of the reviews I do have some observations to make;<br /><br />1) The USB cord is 4 feet 3 inches long. That's fine for most people. But if your computer is on the floor it may be too short. I've ordered the [[ASIN:B003Z4G3I6 Plugable 7 Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub with 3A Power Adapter]]. Trust me, you'll want a powered USB hub later anyway for other game controlers/panels.<br /><br />2) I've read complaints about the potentiometers (electrical thingies attached to the levers inside the box) going bad. This is not uncommon with potentiometers and can easily be fixed by using \\"contact cleaner\\" sold in any electronics store, even Radio Sh--k. I took the bottom off (watch where the screws come from, as there are 6 screws in 3 different sizes. IF YOU HAVE TO PRY THE BOTTOM LOOSE THEN ALL OF THE SCREWS ARE NOT OUT.) and could see that there is another assembly that needs to come out so that you can spray the contact cleaner on the pots.<br /><br />3) There is a complaint that the stems coming out of the box are plastic and may break. This unit is not an arcade controller. You WILL NOT be slamming the levers around. Don't worry about it.<br /><br />All in all, I can highly recommend this item. The only possible problem is the relatively short cord.<br /><br />A special thanks goes to the review by \\"SEATAC\\" on July 6, 2010;<br /><br />\\"As I moved the aforementioned all the way up and down, they would only register from about 21% to 79%, so I could not get the full range.\\"<br /><br />\\".... in FSX, Controls, Calibration, set the Sensitivity for all three levers all the way to the right and set the Null Zone for all three levers all the way to the left.\\"<br /><br />That solved the only real problem I had.the way to the right and set the Null Zone for all three levers all the way to the left.\\"<br /><br />That solved the only real problem I had.

With encouragement and love from Family and friends, and her faith God, was able to come back from her terrible ordeal to once again be a competing Champion, with only one arm.  It was truly Inspirational.  After her exhibiting the Courage, determination, and positive character to turn this tragedy into triumph, even her most bitter rival became a loyal friend.  WOW!

Captivating world of Greek mythology with a boy who reminds me of a famous boy wizard, but he's a demigod. He gets into some amazing adventures with his classmates at a camp for extraordinary kids. Sounds familiar? It is, but in its own way. I'm happy Riordan lend his imaginative mind to this new series. Heroes of Olympus is worth picking up at any age.

1609611543|5.0|I was sick and getting sicker for many years until I went on a gluten-free diet. That was six years ago and my kids, mother and I (all gluten sensitive, all on a GF diet since then) have all gotten much, much better, but we all noticed a return of or persistence of symptoms no matter what we did, and especially when we ate gluten-free foods made with rice flour. Turns out we all have trouble with rice and just about any grain. Not what we wanted to hear, but it's true. I've now been grain free for a couple of months and it has made a big difference. Industries too often shape our lives and our health and it's high time someone explained the link between what we're told is the base of our healthy food pyramid and so much of what ails us.
B000I0PZ1Q|5.0|I'm very surprised at how current, 21st century this movie seems when you watch it, but it's just the opposite. The acting is absolutely perfect. Oscar award holders would be ashamed of themselves if they watched the acting in this movie :) Well, unless they played in it and got it :)<br /><br />This movie shows us how TV shapes lives (well, now, maybe it's facebook and twitter, not tv any more :P ), what a great effect it has on people. Anyone who denies this is welcome to watch this movie.<br /><br />Woow, it has been a few months since I watched this movie, but, thinking of it still makes me wanna take a deep breath... In a good way though :)
B0036S4C6G|5.0|If you're into rock, creative writing, storytelling through the generations, than you'll probably enjoy this book. I know I did. Its a great story, creatively executed that, while a little tough to follow at times, comes to a terrific crescendo at the end... Highly recommended.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This is her second album,, and it is fantastic.. This gal has such a strong emotional voice, its unbelievable.  Hits from the album include \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", \\"Rumor has It\\"  \\"Someone Like You\\", and I predict \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" will be the next hit off this CD.  \\"Turning Tables\\" is another great song that has been covered recently. Her great sultry voice and the strong well done instrumentals combine to make this album a \\"must have\\" in your collection.
B000002OX7|5.0|Simply said, The Who were the most incredible band to come from across the pond to the America's period.  I know that's a strong statement, but no other british band, with the exception of The Bee Gees, has blown my mind over the years the way they have.  I've heard all the essential ones and have also enjoyed Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, etc.  But none of them have the overall brilliance in my mind quite like The Who.<br /><br />This album, which has been noted in reviews here and throughout history, was the result of the abandoning of Pete Townshend's epic concept album \\"Lighthouse\\".  He instead produced this masterpiece, which was released in 1971, which would turn out to be one of, if not, the greatest rock and roll album of all time.  Only Pete Townshend and The Who could take what would be considered a failure by most and turn it into one of the most complete and perfect albums ever released.<br /><br />This is a band whose members were some of the best and what they did individually and the best, in my opinion, rock band ever at blending those individual talents into an cohesive, song making machine.  The album truly solidified them as one of the all time greats and showcased Pete Townshend's unparalled genius as a songwriter in rock.  The changes in mood and movements on this album are incredible and it has all the essentials, hard driving rock anthems \\"Baba O'Reily; \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", melodical ballads \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and a gem written by someone other than Townshend, \\"My Wife\\" penned by their great bassiest and songwriter John Entwistle.<br /><br />Overall this is an incredible album from beginning to end and should be mentioned in the same breath as other historical albums as it's influence can be felt even to this day and millions of their fans point back to it as the album that forever made them fall in love with the band.  An all time classic and one that will be enjoyed into infinity.

B003ASKR2A|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read and a must read for everyone.<br /><br />When I first picked up Watchmen, I was not expecting to read a novel with such complex themes and great literary construction. Watchmen is by no means a simple book with pictures but a novel of intense meaning. Moore is an incredibly talented author exposing the realities of human nature and society. The theme of the nature of superheroes is central to this novel's success. Moore presents the reader with a realistic interpretation of superheroes with his portrayal of superheroes not just as the defenders of morality but also as human beings, with human flaws. The dichotomy of good and evil within the superheroes is symbolic of the same dichotomy existing in every aspect of society. Moore argues in this novel that everything we perceive as positive and good in the world always contains negative elements. Moore also argues that despite our best efforts the future is unchangeable, that through human actions we are always marching closer to our doom. This argument is established through the repeated use of the cover image. The smiley face on the cover of the novel is symbolic of the human tendency to ignore even the blatantly obvious and destructive problems in the world. The repetition of this element throughout the novel juxtaposed with immorality demonstrates the human refusal to accept the problems of the world.<br /> Moore is an incredibly talented author employing multiple forms of figurative language to elucidate the themes of his novel. Moore's control of the English language is amazing. Moore's use of idioms in the novel establishes a cultural connection with the reader, allowing them a deeper understanding of the transpiring events and how they relate to the themes of the novel. The copious amount of puns in the novel not only serve to enlist vivid mental imagery and deeper insight, but also serve as a real example of Moore's arguments. Puns in the novel only exist injuxtaposition with events that are significant to the development of the plot or immoral actions, because puns garner a comedic response from the reader, the reader is laughing at immoral actions and the development of life-threatening problems. This intentional paradox is Moore's method of conveying his argument that human beings ignore problems are refuse to accept the negative reality of situations. Only an extremely skilled writer could possibly design their writing to work so harmoniously with the reader. In addition, the use of symbolism by Moore is skillful in that he is able to repeat the image of his theme throughout the novel as a signature indicating general events that relate to the readers.<br /> Despite Moore's strengths, he is as fallible as his superheroes. The beginning of Watchmen is the most negative in the book, albeit only slightly affecting the quality. The novel begins immediately with an event confusing to the reader and only understood superficially after reading the second chapter. Indeed, most of the first chapter of the novel was confusing to me because it lacked any exposition of the characters used. That said, the mystery of the characters was still compelling enough that I continued and enjoyed the rest of the novel. However, that lack of detailed character exposition may be a non-starter for some readers.<br /> As a whole Watchmen is one of the best books, I have ever read. Not only is the novel densely packed with deep social commentary and relevant themes it has a gripping plot and is written so well you will not want to put it down.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I watched the pacific after it came out on dvd and was amazed at the detail that had been put into it. Having not seen Band of Brothers I had no expectations of what this series would offer me but it didn't disappoint in the least. In agreement with some other reviewers it did slow down at times and it was at times hard to keep up with the characters. What I found helpful for me was to read the two books that this series was based on, Helmet for my Pillow and With the Old Breed, and then watch the series again. You'll have a better understanding of the characters and what they were thinking. Also, go onto youtube and look up EB Sledge and hear what he has to say in his own voice. I believe the series will come alive for you then if it hasn't already. Regardless of your thoughts on the series, it should make you proud of those who fought in that theater.
B005H9B2CE|2.0|I had expectations low enough that it took seeing a 4-star rating on Amazon to decide to watch Thor.  Mistake.  It's tough for any movie to recover when the hero and title character is an unsympathetic lightweight.  And when his love interest is supposed to be a passionate scientist, but she's played to look like a high school junior who's moderately excited by an undefined class project, the movie's probably gone.  Good special effects and sets, a C- script, a good-looking and well-shot setting somewhere in the American Southwest, and you have your basic 2-star fantasy flick luring people in with over-generous reviews.  Save your money.
B005GSY23M|5.0|The soundtrack is always important in establishing the overall atmosphere and tone for a film, but this goes double for Drive. Without this soundtrack it would have been an entirely different film in my opinion. But this is a review for the soundtrack not the movie, so go see it if you haven't already, it's amazing.  If you're like a lot of people now days and have a little nostalgia for the 80's, or if you like good electro and synthpop in general, this album is perfect for you. However, with only 5 actual songs before Cliff Martinez's score kicks in, I was left wanting more. Once I started researching the artists to see if they had any full-length albums of their own, I opened up a pandora's box full of equally amazing artists with the same vision and style.  All the artists on this soundtrack belong to a French collective called Valerie. They are largely unknown in the U.S. for reasons completely lost on me. Perhaps this movie will garner them the attention they deserve. While many artists today make modern music influenced by 80's synth, these guys actually seem to recreate it. They're more 80's than the 80's. Everything from the music to the album art is dripping with it. Check out Anoraak, Minitel Rose, Miami Horror, Futurecop!, The Outrunners, and Tesla Boy in addition to the artists on this album. Or check out Valerie's compilation album \\"Valerie and Friends\\" here on Amazon. You won't be disappointed.
1416562605|4.0|I was prepared to dislike this 2008 Man Booker winner. It starts out as a funny novel: Indian business man starts an imaginary correspondence with Chinese Premier Wen, calling him Mr. Jiaobao, in anticipation of a state visit. You have ring roads and sewage and Olympic gold, but we have democracy and entrepreneurs. I thought this kind of wisecrackery would continue for 276 pages, but luckily it didn't.<br />The narrative turns quickly into a proper Bildungsroman on the master and slave theme. Our man is the driver to a rich clan of landowners and coal mining magnates in an Indian province that we get to know only as Darkness. Business, like politics, is based on a feudal  abyss of corruption, on violence and lawlessness. The political leader of Darkness is called The Great Socialist. The man is a shameless thug, who robs all his constituents according to their donating power.<br />Our man is called the white tiger already as a little boy, for his will to break the barriers, to escape from the chicken coop, which imposes a self control dictatorship on the poor classes. The novel amounts to a bitter condemnation of India's social world.<br />In it's core it is hardboiled social realism, despite the comedic extravagances and the minor excursions into magical realism.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars? I do not completely like the beginning with the Wen letters, nor the ending, when the narrator winds down his tale with the specifics of his business success.
0385534639|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I found the characters and ideas--the \\"world\\" of this book--to be enchanting.  It is a good read, and I recommend it to anybody who likes a fit of fantasy and whimsy, with a touch of melancholy, but I would forewarn you: the book does not tie everything up neatly.  There is no big dramatic ending.  There is a bit of drama, but it only lasts for a few sentences, and it is not really *climactic* in any way.  Things just sort of get drawn together and tied up (with many loose ends left dangling).  If you can live with that, by all means, go ahead and give the book a chance.
1594202842|2.0|This book is nothing but SPAIF, written from the point of view of a neurotic egomaniac. Because she's Asian, she gets a pass for \\"cultural\\" differences. I guarantee you a book from a white Appalachian mother or a black mother from Detroit full of tales like locking a three-year-old outside in the cold or denying a child bathroom breaks would not be met with book deals and the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Honestly, this book is just dull. There's nothing interesting about reading about kids being harassed and bullied to death, or being lectured about how lazy and bad Western parents are. If she was a better writer, maybe it would come off as self-deprecating humor; as it is, it just comes off as mean. Chua also sidesteps the fact that the bulk of her parenting has nothing to do with China and everything to do with MONEY. Chua and her family are upper-middle class, if not upper class period.<br /><br />Whether you buy the book to see if she's as bad as she comes across, or because you're looking for parenting tips, or because she says that she comes off worse than she really is, the point is that you'd be buying the book. And that's all Chua cares about.<br /><br />PS: It's laughable that she brags about the \\"results\\" of her parenting, when her children are 15 and 18/19, respectively. Come see us when they're 25.
B002QFYJF4|5.0|I've seen this film many years ago. When I see it again on blu-ray, I feel like watch it on new experience.  The story never dies, it's so real, even now. It's story about life.  For a 3+ hours long film, blu-ray is the best format to show it beautifully on your home cinema.

Just when you think your collections are complete here comes the remasters which are a must have of any floyd fan.  I have all of their musice in cd forms and now it looks like I need to make space for the remasters!!  Oh well, what a way to hear \\"sorrow\\" ~\\"Dogs\\" and my all time favorite \\"On the turning away\\"....This was the cd that made people say \\"Roger Who?\\"
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I already have TDK DVD. Though it was good on DVD, it has poor extra features on it.  So I double dip with the BD version, and I will regret if I didn't.  This BD is the best format for TDK. Picture and audio are very stunning.  You can't be wrong buying this film on BD.
B0054TK99E|4.0|The reason there isn't a disc release is because the series is too new.  The show just finished airing - it will take a few months for them to release the DVD/BR versions. The streaming episodes are usually available about 12 hours after the episode airs - discs take longer because they require a production run.

B000002JKA|5.0|and it probably is their actual best. This album was released in 1994 as their 3rd album. What a great 3rd album this is. John Petrucci is arguably at his best here and all hands down, Portnoy has never done anything better than this album; His drumming is at it's top form and I haven't heard it sound cooler than this. LaBrie sings much differently than on Images and Words (See my review for that), but it's nevertheless extremely good. Kevin Moore would ultimately leave after this album, but he leaves the band after 3 amazing albums of his talent. He makes Rudess sound like a child in comparison to sheer skill and mastery on Keyboard. Moore is also a much better song-writer.  Music:  This music is much more \\"In your face\\" and much darker than their previous albums but that may just be what makes it better.  1. 6:00- This is probably my favorite Dream Theater song of all time. I love the drums and entire song is entertaining from start to finish. I also love the groove it has during the chorus.  2. Caught in a Web- I also love this song a lot. This is the perfect song to listen to on Halloween and I used to be heavily into Lego's Bionicles...This would be a great theme for the 2005 storyline. But anyway, this song is amazingly dark but still extremely musical. I like the whole thing as well. This and track 1 are horribly underrated.  3. Innocence Faded- This one is extremely light compared to the previous 2 songs. It's also much happier than the previous 2. I like the composition of this one as well.  4. Erotomania- Instrumental song. I like it, but I'm not a fan of instrumentals. However, this one is heavy and then turns into something extremely beautiful.  5. Voices- It's good. I think it will grow on me more in time but for now it's just a nice song.  6. The Silent Man- Their best ballad ever. I love the meaning of it. Listen to it and decipher it yourself! It's a great song!  7. The Mirror- An extremely heavy song. I love the driving beat that DT gives this one.Very mystical and extremely heavy.  8. Lie- I like this one too. This was the single from the album, but 6:00 would've been a much better single. Still a good song tho. It's very cool.  9. Lifting Shadows off a Dream- Another great ballad. This one has a U2 sound to it and it's very pretty. I love it.  10. Scarred- Great epic! I like this one very much as well! DT are amazing at making long songs.  11. Space-Dye Vest- It's pretty, but not their best. From the reviews that praised this, it's overrated. Good, but not that good.  Verdict: This is probably the best DT album ever. If you like Symphony X or are a DT fan, then get it! If you're new to DT, start with Images and Words. You can thank me later, this is dark and might turn you away from this awesome band. I know that after listening to this, I was concerned about listening to stuff that came after this...but It was all in my head. This is far better than the stuff after this, but the other stuff isn't that bad...it's as good as Symphony X. Enjoy this album!
B004WPYNY8|4.0|I like this album now, but it took several weeks for it to grow on me. From the first listen, I could tell it was well-crafted, well-produced, well-performed. But how did it compare to prior albums, and did it move me? My gut feel was pretty weak. I was expecting a concept album that might rival \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" because while SX isn't consistent with its lyrics, at least the music is usually powerful. But this album just didn't \\"wow\\" me. In time, I've come to appreciate it as a series of songs which - as other reviewers have pointed out - tend to sound rather similar. It's the way Romeo writes and arranges songs that holds the band in a developmental rut. Each of these songs could be moved to one of the last few albums and fit right in. Sometimes it's good that the songs aren't really different from prior SX work, because that formula is why we keep buying SX albums. But sometimes I want a different progression than SX keeps churning out. I wonder whether it's time for SX (and DT, but that's another review) to bring in outside writers. And yet that familiarity is comfortable, too - variations on several themes we know SX does so well. I disagree that Allen is growling rather than singing, or that he wants to sound like a death metal singer - he has a huge range, and when he's in the lower end he's quite gruff, but there's a word for that which I don't think I can post here. He sings with conviction, basically. *What* he's singing is often pretty poor poetry, but his performance matches the power of the instrumentalists. And that's why I like this album - it's got power and it's solid even if it's nothing surprising.<br /><br />I do wish, however, that Pinella would get some new patches for his keyboards. His sounds haven't upgraded since \\"V\\" and they sound really dated now. Romeo's MIDI-triggered intro to \\"Iconoclast\\" is also using patches that were fine on \\"Odyssey\\" but now are distractingly inadequate. However, LePond plays a fill on \\"Bastards of the Machine\\" that is the fastest bass run I've ever heard - including John Alderete's work in Racer X - and highlights how good he sounds compared to the keyboards. And Rullo has his best sound, mix, and arrangements since... well, ever. Maybe there's something to be said - ironically, on this album - for analog instruments played with passion.<br /><br />The concept of \\"Iconoclast\\", both the title itself and the semi-major theme of this album, could have made for some really incredible lyrics that could've elevated this album from solid to brilliant, even magnificent, but instead SX gave us a marvelously engineered album of songs I can't hum after many, many listens. The only songs I can remember are \\"When All Is Lost\\" and \\"Reign In Madness\\", the former because it evokes the majesty of \\"Accolade\\" and \\"Accolade II,\\" \\"Candlelight Fantasia,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and \\"The Sacrifice\\"; the latter because on the surface it seems to be about zombies (a theme I absolutely hate) but is actually a song that doesn't sound much like the rest of SX's catalog - and I love it!<br /><br />I think this album compares with \\"Odyssey\\". I think \\"V\\" and \\"Paradise Lost\\" are better. I think most people reading these reviews will either say that nothing since \\"V\\" has been good enough, or that this album is SX's best yet, since that what most people who post reviews seem to say. It's a solid album for this year, and better than DT's new release, but not as impressive to me as Anthrax's new [[ASIN:B0058VA2U4 Worship Music]].

0385344325|3.0|Best because Child wanted to show that he was still master of his own character - a lot of writers are swept away by their own creation - and so he set out to do REACHER:ORIGINS. And succeeded. And produced a flashback story that is 100% proof Reacher, steadfast, action packed, and with (the usual) shattering ending. The worst because the entire exercise was meaningful only to the writer himself, and the rest of us would have been just as happy (nay, happy-er) with a new novel. And then there are the flaws. Reacher as Antihero works best when he has another character, or characters, to contrast against. Nothing here. Instead we have a female character who in spite of Childs best efforts is never fully drawn and never quite comes alive. And finally there is the cynicism. Wow. Somehow in this odd tale Reacher kills 4 (count em, 4) people without breaking a sweat or even being asked to explain his actions. In a novel that already lacks a moral core, this is unsettling.
1848378963|5.0|A mystery of the first degree. Many plots would fall apart in this day and age with forensics as they stand. But for the time it was written, it was a marvel of suspense. A good read. I loved it. Sad when it was done.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|I listened to this on audio and when I started I it I thought oh wow it really sounds like a child is talking! Then they had three people narrating this book so I also thought that was nice. The child like voice got old fast tho....<br />I REALLY wanted to like this book and was POSITIVE I would! It had such amazing reviews and the story seemed like a really good story, but I just did not like it. Towards the end I found myself looking at the time left and being like UGH I have this much time left?<br />The story was all told from a 5 year old's point of view and I don't really care what this is based on true story or not this is NOT believable for instance, a 5 year old can read words that most older kids can't read but still talks like a baby? If he is supposed to be smart then make him talk a smarter then \\"why he do that?\\" type things. He is also a BRAT! He got his way on EVERYTHING! My son is 5 and yes he trows fits etc but he does NOT tell me what to do etc.. ok yes we are not in one room and I am not locked up trying to raise him granted but even after his mom gave into EVERYTHING he wanted including going back to the house after they got out when she clearly did not want to and made her throw up. Ok, make the argument that she was trying to help him get past what they lived through. You never see any of that part in the book tho because it is all from Jack's point of view and when it actually came to anything that MAY be interesting he would say \\"my ears got tired so I stopped listening\\" so you never really got to hear how any of them really got over the abuse and being locked up etc..<br />I hear many people say I wanted to put this book down it was disturbing and at first I thought yeah this book is going to be like that because of what it is about but it really was not.. all you heard all through the book was about \\"rug\\", \\"spoon\\", \\"table\\" etc there was no gore or explicit scenes etc.. there are many other books written about very similar things that are SO much better then ROOM!<br />I don't really know why this bothered me so badly but the whole breastfeeding thing  really irked me so badly! He was always saying \\"I want some\\" or \\"I got some\\" or \\"I got lots\\" etc.. at 5! I had someone tell me well maybe it was just easier to give him what he wanted... while I can't imagine being in his situation or hers at all I do not understand the point of breast feeding until he was 5 at all ! He would say \\"I am thirsty, I want some\\" and \\"I like the left one best it is more creamy\\" and he would pull her shirt up in public after they got out. Yes I get he was not used to being out in public but the whole thing was gross and disturbing to me! NOT saying that breastfeeding is at all, however when the child is old enough to say I like the left one because it is more creamy and he wonders if \\"old nick\\" is getting some well then it is time to stop!<br />I guess another poster was correct in saying you either love or hate this book and I hated it.much better then ROOM!<br />I don't really know why this bothered me so badly but the whole breastfeeding thing  really irked me so badly!

B004P8JPS6|5.0|I read everything in this series - Lee Child's long running series featuring Jack Reacher.  This is far and away his best.  This book tells why Reacher is Reacher.  The story takes him his military roots to the incident that makes him who he is.  The murder of a woman in a small town and the military's response - which includes Reacher is the heart of the story.  But Reacher's moral compass is tilted by the events that transpire - from the \\"friends in high places\\" to the local PD.  Child's prose is crisp and the story page turning.  If you love the series - not to be missed.  But this book is also a stand alone best seller.
B005LZZMRK|5.0|This new album from Steven Wilson album is great. It gives a vibe that sits somewhere between early Porcupine Tree and Fear of A Blank Planet Porcupine Tree. There's some great melodies interwoven into epic tracks of piano flourishes and saxophone howls. Wilson does a fair amount of singing, but the instrumentals strike me as the star of the show. Although I wouldn't call the album experimental, it does give off the progressive rock aura. If you've been craving some new porcupine tree that sounds like the old school porcupine tree, you can't go wrong.
030788743X|5.0|I lived through the 1980's with very own Colecovision and Adam Computer, and I don't love them as much as this author.  But I am totally into video games and science fiction, so I still liked the book.<br /><br />Plotwise, Wade Owen Watts, under the online OASIS identity of Parzival (\\"Z\\" for short) is obsessively questing for his holy grail -- the keys to the OASIS itself, left by it's reclusive billionaire genius software creator, a man who loved the 1980's and left years of personal blogs talking about his geekdom.  Wade is a trailer park kid in a 2040 dystopia where the 'net has become an interactive virtually real 3-D immersion World-of-Warcraft like simulation encompassing thousands of licensed worlds.  Somewhere in there, there are three keys, and the person who opens the doors will inherent billions and control of the company that controls the internet itself.<br /><br />A detail that did annoy me was the level cap on the supra-modern OASIS system was level 99.  I've played plenty of RPG games with a level cap of 9999, and even a few games with no (discovered) level cap.  Capping at 99 with the endless plethora of quests available is a bad company decision; if I had an interactive game that included say all of Azeroth, Morrowind, Firefly, Star Wars RPG, etc... you can bet I'd never leave the cap at a simple level 99.<br /><br />Back to the protagonist -- Wade's life sucks.  He uses OASIS as an escape from normal reality, even attending school completely online.  As he becomes successful at his chosen quest though, the opportunities offered to him change.  Cline does paint a very depressing picture of post-peak oil world, using descriptions like '30 years into the Great Recession' and 'forced work indenture'.  Still, I felt like I could relate to his main character from my own past.<br /><br />On a personal note though, I'd be so annoyed if I played through an entire enigmatic riddle, laboriously connected the data and dots, only to hit Arcade-difficult Joustthat I did not have the hand-eye coordination to succeed at.  Everyone portrayed in the book had this amazing ability at older retro games, and I found it unrealistic even with pattern recognizing algorithms and known source code.  It does make perfect sense in the context of the book, but...  I couldn't rack up the high scores in 80's games like that, even when I played obsessively during my childhood.  This jealously/personal inability shattered parts of the illusion for me, because it hammered home I could never be 'Ready Player One' myself.  And doing what the characters did would be so cool.<br /><br />Anyway, take away the props, and the story itself is great questing fiction.  I hope to be reading Mr. Cline's work in the future.<br /><br />Edit:  bumped it up to five stars since I still find myself thinking about certain scenes a couple years later.

This is what our men and women go through daily for you and me. It really opened my eyes.  I put off seeing it for so long because I didn't want to watch spiderman pretend to be a military personnel. He had the best performance. He was that character and I now think of him as an amazing actor. The entire cast was perfect.  I can't say enough about this movie! It was amazing.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|So yes you can stand closer to your tv, but you cant use the kincet on the main menu at all becaue of terrible hand tracking. In games tracking gets a little better (ex. Dance central) but you do better anyways without Zoom. You are lucky if you can calibrate it at all.
B003L77G06|5.0|While this was clearly a winner with its first season, Modern Family has managed to stay on top. At the moment together with the Big Bang Theory it si the best comedy on TV. There is not one weak episode really and the episeodes go freom nice humour to pure slapstick. One of the best is hwen the Dunplhy children walk in on their prents i n the bedroom. The acting and the writing is simply superb and this series is a real joy to watch.

B005NA3B8U|1.0|Really kind of mad at how difficult it is to play this game. The graphics are good, but it very challenging to play with your finger blocking the view. I can't go very far without something hitting me from this blocked view area. I'd like a refund.
B004LROMSO|2.0|It's hard to figure out for whom this cheesy new series has been conceived.  Viewers who don't know the King Arthur legend won't appreciate the re-imagining done by its creators, and stalwart Arthurians will just be pissed off by it.  Which begs the question, \\"Why fiddle around with an audience's expectations if you're not going to make the story better?\\"<br /><br />The Sword in the...Waterfall?  Really?  Because a plain old stone isn't good enough?  I don't know, it worked just fine for Alfred, Lord Tennyson and E.B. White.  But silly me, this is television, where pandering to the lowest common denominator is something of a requirement.  Thus the simulated, soft core porn, public urination and Philip Manchester's hilariously awful, anachronistic Justin Bieber haircut.  Manchester's character, BTW, is Leontes, fiance of Guinevere, who in this version is a Malibu type babe who seems to have hung out a little too much at Ye Olde Fighte Club.  Leontes?  What happened to Lancelot?  Oh, yes, I forgot, this is a bold, new, rethinking.  Perhaps he'll come snowboarding in sometime during Season Two.  Or not.<br /><br />On the plus side, the production values are solid, as, for the most part, are the performances (Clare Forlani's wooden Igraine the bland, yet painful, exception).<br /><br />Enter this \\"Camelot,\\" if you must, but be aware that's it's the kind of Classic Comics cheese that will stink up the place long before you've reached episode 12.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  Lots of action, found myself  involved and pulling for Hanna.  Number one show this year!
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|You know going in what you are going to get with a Michael Bay flick....lots of explosions and copious hot chick butt shots. You certainly get that here. However, it does seem like he has taken the criticisms from the last two movies (and part 2 in particular) to heart. In this movie, you dont get lost in the combat scenes, for example. Also, where he went more Wild West for the battles, in this movie, the Transformers use more martial arts and medieval knight styles in the combat sequences. It worked quite well.<br />Emotionally, there was also more a draw in this movie. The comedic scenes were plentiful, and i laughed often throughout the movie. Also, when Ironhide dies, and when Bumblebee gets captured, you cant help but get a little choked up.<br />Megan Fox's replacement was equally hot, so no drop off there.<br /><br />...and, much like the cartoons, while Megatron is a bad ass as a rule, he has moments where he seems quite frail. If you remember the old cartoons, there were moments of cowardice for him. Here, there arent, but there are moments of weakness.<br /><br />I dont understand all the negative reviews here really. If you are expecting an oscar worthy movie, you shouldnt be watching this to begin with. If, however, you go in just expecting a fun and fast romp, i dont see how you could be disappointed. Also, for now at least, the reviews for the DVD. Blue Ray, and Rentals are all being thrown together. So...read a few before you make a decision. They arent reviewing the same things.

0061438294|5.0|I used Mr. Navarro's book in conjunction with three other great books about threat assessment and general people-reading skills: The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker, Telling Lies by Dr. Paul Ekman, and Liespotting by Pamela Meyer. Each book has brought something different to the table, with \\"What Every Body is Saying\\" being the most in-depth on body language (Ekman is more focused on the face, Meyer on words). This book is a must-read for anyone who would like a better understanding of how to accurately read how people are feeling. As Navarro points out, however, there is no all-encompassing \\"Pinocchio\\" tell that allows for deception detection. There are only clues to be used in context to detect changes in emotion.

Or that the Bell twins have actually moved home and the boy-next-door who broke her heart two years ago with them?<br /><br />`Lola and the Boy Next Door' is the sort-of-sequel to Stephanie Perkin's smash hit contemporary YA romance, `Anna and the Boy Next Door.'<br /><br />I love, love, loved `Anna' when I read it last year. I have been a big fan of adult contemporary romances for a long time, but `Anna and the French Kiss' was one of the first YA contemporaries I enjoyed as much (if not more) than books in its adult counterpart genre. So I was thrilled to learn that Ms Perkins intended to get on a role with her books and release two more Anna `companion' novels. `Lola' is the second, with `Isla and the Happily Ever After' to come in the fall of 2012.<br /><br />I think everything I loved about `Anna and the French Kiss' has been revisited (but not rehashed) in `Lola and the Boy Next Door'.<br /><br />First off; setting. `Anna' took place in Paris, and was a beautiful ode to the city of love. Admittedly, Ms Perkins had a tough task ahead of her coming up with an equally charming setting for her second book. But she accomplishes it with San Francisco. That's right, the American city famous for the Golden Gate Bridge, gay pride, Alcatraz, fog and being the setting of `Full House' (*sigh*, uncle Jesse). I love that Perkins set her story here, because the city had repercussions throughout the plot. First of all, Lola has two gay dads. Andy and Nathan adopted Lola from Nathan's run-away, addicted sister Norah. It sounds very soap-operaish, but for Lola it's completely normal. Norah was unstable and had Lola when she was just a teenager. Andy and Nathan had been in a stable and committed relationship for a long time, and wanted a baby - Lola needed them and vice versa. It may sound strange on the outside, but Perkins wonderfully illustrates the normal of Lola's family. Her dads are both protective and loving (and neither of them is `the wife', thank you very much) and even though Norah pops up to cause problems once in a while, Lola knows who her real parents are. I loved the family dynamic. It was missing from `Anna', because of a boarding school plot and Etienne's imperfect home life, so it was a nice switch-up to have `Lola' be so family focused. And it's a wonderful family. Nathan and Andy were both stand-outs for me. I would have liked more conflict and page-time with Lola's birth mum, Norah, but I understand that theirs isn't the sort of easily-summarised relationship that can be addressed in a primarily romance-focused book.<br /><br />Secondly, the San-Fran scenery gave Lola the perfect romantic setting. Lola fell in love with the boy-next-door, Cricket Bell, when he stepped out in pinstripe pants two years ago. They don't just live next door to each other, they have same-facing windows that are perilously close thanks to San Francisco architecture. I loved that Perkins used this little city-quirk to write some very sweet scenes between Cricket and Lola. Everything from broom handles to late night moon-talking makes for some very `awwww' moments, all thanks to the city setting.<br /><br />Something that carries over from `Anna' into `Lola' is the love triangle. When the book begins Lola is happy with her punk-rock (older) boyfriend, Max. That is, until Cricket Bell returns and gets her heart racing all over again. I really liked the romantic conflict that on the one hand; Lola loves the `cool' factor that comes with dating the older, rugged Max. Cricket is very much the `Beta' hero when compared to the tattooed rocker. But it forces Lola to step back and look at who she loves being with, but who she can't live without.<br /><br />Finally, I loved Lola. She's amazing. She doesn't just dress - she dresses to impress. She's all about costumes and extravagance and I could totally picture her as a contestant on an upcoming season of `Project Runway'. Argh! I loved her. She's creative and fearless, a little aimless in love but entirely lovable.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on Cricket . . .  he's a goofy gentleman with an interesting family history and thoroughly nerdy underbelly. He's a very different YA hero - certainly not your typical bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks (hello Max!) who seems prevalent in much YA romance fiction. Cricket is instead, genuine. The nice boy all good girls should fall for - the one who normally finishes last. I adored him and want more like him in my romance books!<br /><br />I did love `Lola and the Boy Next Door', but I didn't really love the `companion novel' tag. I don't necessarily understand why `Lola' had to be associated with `Anna' at all? I would understand if `Lola' was also set at the School of America in Paris. I would understand the `companion' tag if `Lola' was actually about one of the characters we first met in `Anna'; John, Meredith or Rashmi perhaps? Instead, the only tenuous connection that `Lola' has to `Anna' is the appearance of Anna and Etienne as co-workers at Lola's local cinemaplex. And I did get the feeling that Anna and Etienne weren't essential to the novel or Lola's world - really, the helpful and lovey-dovey co-workers could have been entirely new secondary characters. If they worked at all it was as a certainty of love - Lola may just assume that Anna and Etienne are in the `puppy love' stage of their relationship, but returning readers know the hurdles they went through to be together. Otherwise I really could have done without Anna again . . .  not because I don't love her, but because I think Lola was strong enough on her own.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins has done it again. She has confirmed that she's deserving of the crown `Reigning Queen of Romantic YA'. `Lola and the Boy Next Door' is another beautiful page-turner set in the gorgeous San-Fran with a quirky heroine and a gentlemanly hero.

B005G4TJI4|1.0|Being a big Sci-fi guy and a big Transformers fan (well, when I was kid in the 80's) -you'd think I would have loved these movies. Wrong. The truth is they suck. The first one was... okay, the second horrid and this, the third in the trilogy is a grand failure. Yes, the effects and battles are stunning, no issues there, but if that is all a movie is -is just effects and battles then what do we have? Michael Bay is known for his big budget stunners but this movie, though visually stunning was just boring.<br /><br />I love how they tied in the Space Race of the 60's to the Transformer Mythology and I thought \\"okay, good premise\\" but after a half hour it just grew gruesomely tiresome. The parents make a couple of quick scenes, adding nothing but a comedic release, the new girl -whatever her name is, looks more fake and plastic (and acts that way too) than Megan Fox.<br /><br />The movie was too much to absorb -the effects were hard to take in -which shows the level of detail given to them. Again, they are stunning but that's all there is. The acting is horrendous, the intros of past characters a waste, the sub-plots went nowhere -the movie didn't hold my attention.<br /><br />I love effects based movies -really. I remember when \\"Independence Day\\" came out in '96 -back then that was a big deal but it had heart and humor. Even \\"Armageddon\\" -one of Bay's other movies from '98 had more heart and development than this. If you're a total geek (or 12) you'll love this -if you have any taste, rent it and watch it once. Not worth the time or money to buy it. Utter rubbish...

Her father's band mates and best friends are praying and Mia's first love, Adam, is begging her to stay.<br /><br />Mia knows all of this, because while her body is bruised and battered lying prone in a hospital bed, Mia looks on.

When she has nothing left to live for, what's the point in staying?<br /><br />Mia has a choice to make - a life or death decision.<br /><br />`If I Stay' is the smash-hit contemporary young adult novel from Gayle Forman, which recently had a sequel released this year called `Where She Went'.<br /><br />Yes, I have been `reading' under a rock. I knew that `If I Stay' was a best-selling, beloved YA novel released in 2009. I read the rave reviews and knew that there was a furore surrounding this incredible book's sequel . . .  still, I didn't read it. I knew that this book packed a punch - that it was sadness through and through and to be honest, I just was never in the right head-space to get stuck into the novel. Until now. Don't ask me what did it - I just decided I was ready to brave the emotional terrain and whip out the Kleenex.<br /><br />Mia's story really does start out sad . . .  and get worse from there. The car accident is the plot-trigger, and everything that comes after is Mia weighing up and pros and cons of staying, or letting go. It's a sad start, with plenty of emotional turmoil heaped throughout. But the novel is, surprisingly, not altogether depressing.<br /><br />While Mia's ravaged body repairs itself in a cold hospital room, ghost-like Mia remembers her life to this point. She recalls her punk-rock parents and their dismay when Mia took up the cello and fell for Mozart. She remembers the birth of her little brother, Teddy, and all her brother's funniest moments. She remembers how her best friend, Kim, saved her from herself by prodding her into music camp. But most of all, Mia remembers Adam. Adam, the beautiful and dishevelled older boy played in a rock band and inexplicably loved Mia - and how she loved him back.<br /><br />The novel cuts between present-time and back-tracking memories; as Mia's fetch-like form watches the nurses monitor her vital signs and doctors perform surgeries, she also recounts her memories in vivid detail.<br /><br />I did love the book, as I suspected I would.

But also because Forman could have dragged Mia and the story down in a flowery writing style . . .  when you're discussing death and the meaning of life, it's very easy to wax poetic and get too caught up in the meaningful, so that life gets lost amidst the prose.

B005EVVEPK|5.0|I've been waiting years to find an album as good as this- it's as good as anything by Pixies, Nirvana, The Smiths- all my favorite bands. The female singer's voice is beautiful, and the male background vocals work well. It often reminds me of the mood of the song \\"California Dreaming\\". These songs are extremely well written and arranged, very soulful and inspired. The at times slightly off tune vocals somehow make everything more endearing. I'm the pickiest music listener I know and have only found a handful of musicians who meet or surpass my expectations. This band is among them.

B004LROMSO|4.0|I'm not as well-versed in Arthurian Legend as many of the other viewers are, but why would that matter? I think that's the point of retelling the Arthurian Legends - to introduce it to more people.   I enjoyed \\"Camelot\\" overall. This series takes the myths and legends about King Arthur, Merlin, and Camelot and tells a portion of the tale. The series begins when King Uther is killed and Arthur is told he is to become king.   Some complain that \\"Camelot\\" does not remain true to the legends. First, what's wrong with reinvention in a story that has been told and re-told for over 1500 years? Second, am I the only one confused by people's reluctance to allow for leeway in the telling of a story that is mostly myth and legend to begin with?  Some parts were a little slow, but in a 10-hour series, you're most likely going to have that. Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur was rather annoying for a while, but he came into his own in the last couple episodes and if the series had gone on, he would have continued his development of the annoying boy king into the Arthur we all know (or a fictionalized version of the fictionalized version we all know). Yes, sadly, it seems that \\"Camelot\\" will not continue as a series, which is too bad, especially since the setup for the second season looked very promising.  The casting was quite good overall. Eva Green as Morgan was really the standout in the series. Joseph Fiennes as Merlin was good but restrained - it's safe to say we would have learned much more about Merlin in seasons to come. I've never said, \\"You know, Claire Forlani was really memorable in this,\\" but her portrayal of Arthur's mother was very surprising to me. The eighth episode featured her in almost every scene and her performances were heartbreaking and excellent.  I loved the spin they put on the Lady of the Lake myth - it was creative and visually beautiful.  If you have a glimmer of interest in watching this, I recommend you give \\"Camelot\\" a chance knowing that the Complete First Season is actually the Complete Series.  I received this DVD season at no cost as a member of the Vine Program.

B005CMSDLE|5.0|I always search for films with Cate Blanchett...that's probably because I find her work amazing.  She reminds me of a chameleon as she transforms herself to become complex characters in every movie she is in.  She is not afraid to strip her exterior as she evolves for her audience.  Hanna is a MUST SEE movie.  It combines intelligent and assertive screen writing with contrasting actors who are able to compliment each other's skill.  I will watch this movie over and over again because it will feel like I'm seeing it for the first time.  THIS MOVIE IS A FOR SURE TO BE ON ANYONE'S LIST!  Consuelo T. Gabriel
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|They did an acceptable job with this remake, but if you are looking for a really good adaptation of this story, I highly recommend the version with Toby Stephens. It's much longer (about 5 hours as opposed to 2-ish) but does a more thorough job and the emotions are much more palpable. If you're not too particular about your British Romantic novel remake movies, this one is perfectly adequate.

Her mother, Katie, finds herself supporting the family more than Johnny, as he is an alcoholic.  Francie is an admirable girl living in poverty and wants a good education; she has a true love for learning.  Francie and her family live a hard life, but just like the tree that grows in her neighborhood despite a lack of soil, sun, and water, her family will find a way to survive.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith really captures the American Dream at the turn of the century.  Fans of coming of tales must read this literary gem.<br /><br />Francie is one of my favorite literary protagonists.  What is not to love? Despite growing up in a rough neighborhood, she loves books, libraries, and wants better for herself.  Her mother is also strong as she has been dealt a tough hand in life.  She could easily give up, but is an honorable character and a role model for her family.  On the other hand, Johnny, although a sweet romantic, is unpractical and brings his family down.  It was hard to watch his slow spiral into alcoholism and its impact on the Nolans.<br /><br />Smith is a brilliant writer. Her use of flashback takes us back to when Katie and Johnny first met, which was one of my favorite parts of the novel.  Also, there were parts of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn that stopped me in my tracks and there were lines that were simply beautiful.  Here are two of my favorite lines:<br />\\"People always think that happiness is a faraway thing,\\" thought Francie, \\"something complicated and hard to get. Yet, what little things can make it up; a place of shelter when it rains - a cup of strong hot coffee when you're blue; for a man, a cigarette for contentment; a book to read when you're alone - just to be with someone you love. Those things make happiness.\\"<br /><br />\\"From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack intimate friends.

0525422943|5.0|It's three years after the horrific accident and readers reunite with a very different Adam who is now living the dream as a successful rock star.  He's got everything he thought he ever wanted....money, a hot celebrity girlfriend, his band's amazing success, but there's something missing.  Even though he is out of his bedridden depression over losing Mia, sadly, he still can't deal with the stress of his life without medication.  While in NYC, he comes across an ad for Mia's performance and decides last minute to attend. Word gets around that rock star Adam Wilde is attending the performance, so Mia asks him to come backstage.  Mia and Adam reunite for one night and finally talk about things after not seeing each other for three years.  Where She Went, Gayle Forman's sequel to If I Stay, captured my heart.  Granted Where She Went didn't capture it the same way If I Stay did, but it easily became of my favorites books of 2011.<br /><br />First, I must recognize how much I love Forman's writing style. I'd say that after Jenny Han, I like her style the most. It's incredible and as far as I'm concerned she is one of the best young adult contemporary authors out there.  When I first heard that this novel was going to be written from Adam's point of view, I was worried since many young adult authors struggle to capture a guy's perspective; however, I remembered this is Forman we are talking about. DUH! She's brilliant.<br /><br />Where She Went explored many deep issues as only Forman can, but what really spoke to me is the fact that Mia and Adam's meeting was, essentially, by chance.  Forman never makes things unrealistic and Where She Went is believable, even up to the ending. For me, realistic fiction MUST be believable and Forman accomplishes that.  I also love how Forman has her characters deal with grief. It's all so very real and complex, but never overwhelming or tedious for us readers.<br /><br />The characters are so very memorable. I read If I Stay awhile ago and Mia's story is one that I often think about and STILL discuss with bookish people.  It's not a tale that you simply forget about and the same goes for the characters.  What really tugged at my heartstrings was how Forman included a few flashbacks to when Mia's parents and brother were still alive. Like special memories, I just wanted to live in that scene over and over again and bask in its comfort.<br /><br />Also, Forman included lyrics from Adam's music, which I thought was especially creative and added that something special to Where She Went. Not only were the lyrics exceptional (they actually sounded like real music, not like the fake lyrics that authors sometimes come up with....you know what I am talking about!), they also reflected what Adam was going through at the time. I loved them!<br /><br />All in all, Where She Went is easily one of my favorite books. I couldn't be happier with where Forman took Mia and Adam's tale; she never disappoints.

0525423281|4.0|Lola is a quirky and eccentric teenager aspiring to be the next big fashion designer.  She likes to wear the most outlandish clothing and wigs.  Lola fits in perfectly in artsy San Francisco with her two dads and has grown up in one of the beautiful Victorian homes next door to the twins, Cricket and Calliope Bell. They used to be inseparable as children and things changed once Cricket broke Lola's heart.  However, things are different for Lola now. The Bells have moved away to accommodate Calliope's figure skating career and Lola has an older rocker boyfriend now.  Things are going smoothly for Lola until the Bells move back next door along with Cricket.  Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins truly captures first love and captured my heart as well.<br /><br />After reading Anna and the French Kiss, I knew I HAD to get my hands on a copy of Lola and the Boy Next Door.  Much to my surprise, I realized that it is very different from Anna and the French Kiss, which I've come to realize is both good and bad.  Lola was harder for me to relate to than Anna. She's a bit out there, overly dramatic and a tad selfish.  I really couldn't connect with her like I could Anna.  Cricket makes for a really cute love interest, because he's a bit on the nerdy side as he's an aspiring inventor.  He is constantly in the shadow of his figure skating phenom sister, Calliope, and is trying to find his way.  I didn't like how he was bossed around by Calliope; I wanted him to grow a pair and that in itself frustrated me.  Cricket is a downright good guy though and lets be honest, we need that in YA.  Also, I must point out how much I LOVED Lola's dads. They were fantastic and I wish there were more books out there that showcase a family dynamic like Lola's.<br /><br />Perkins' writing style is enthralling.  Even though I couldn't relate to the characters as much as I had hoped for, I was still very much so invested in Lola and the Boy Next Door.  I really enjoy her writing style and before I knew it, I finished the book.  Perkins reminds me so much of Sarah Dessen in that she can take a character, one that I don't necessarily relate to, and make me sympathize and root for her.  I love that about Perkins!<br /><br />I also adored the concept of the \\"boy next door\\" as most people had something like that in their lives at some point.  Perkins does a brilliant job of capturing this and making it magical.  The stolen glances, the talking through the windows, the peeking across the space between the two houses, the long walks in the neighborhood....I loved it. It was so very Dawson's Creek. (*sigh*<br /><br />One of the best parts of Lola and the Boy Next Door is the fact that Anna and St. Clair are in the book.  St. Clair is his usual swoon-worthy self and it was nice to be revisited by Anna.  I liked how Perkins weaved the two story lines together.  Also, just like in Anna and the French Kiss, the setting of the novel becomes just as important and while Paris is a bit more romantic (in my opinion) than San Francisco, she still made the city come to life.  It was the perfect location for a zany girl like Lola.<br /><br />All in all, Lola and the Boy Next Door is a delightful read that will take readers back to their first childhood crushes.  Although it lacked some of the magic that Anna and the French Kiss had, I still recommend it for fans of contemporary fiction as well as Sarah Dessen.  I am a huge fan of Stephanie Perkins and can't wait to read her third book, Isla and the Happily Ever After, which comes out in 2012 and I hear takes place in Paris!

0142419400|5.0|Anna is a typical senior until one day her father, a famous author, decides to send her to boarding school in Paris.  He tells her it will be life changing, she'll become worldly and experience something she won't forget.  She is less than excited to go and leave her best friend as well as possible boyfriend behind.  However, once at the boarding school, she meets a new group of friends and one person, Etinne St. Clair, catches her eye.  He's pretty much perfect, except for one small thing: he's taken! Plus, Anna just started sort-of seeing someone back at home.  Readers will follow Anna throughout her many adventures in Paris, the ups and downs of living life away in a new city, and what happens back at home while you are gone. Simply said, Stephanie Perkins' debut, Anna and the French Kiss, is an unforgettable read.<br /><br />Perkins truly knows how to portray a friendship that COULD be something more.  She really captured the hot/cold moments, the romantic tension, and the unspoken words that are inevitable when two friends are attracted to each other, but deny their feelings.  I've never read a novel that does this better than Perkins. Seriously.  Anna and St. Clair's relationship was spot on.  Who doesn't love a guy with killer looks, an accent, and happens to also be nice? Their relationship felt authentic and they encountered realistic problems; it wasn't all rainbows and cartoons, which added to its credibility.  Plus, I definitely have a literary crush on St. Clair. (My apologies, Mr. Darcy!) He instantly became one of my favorite male characters!<br /><br />Also, Anna is the type of character that's the girl next door.  I have a feeling that most young adults will be able to relate to her quite easily.  She's got brown hair, not very athletic, and a less than perfect smile, which St. Clair happens to love.  I also enjoyed her metamorphosis.  At first she was afraid of the city, but by the middle of book, she was navigating around by herself.  Throughout her stay in Paris, she blossomed and evolved, which was one of the best parts of the book.<br /><br />This book made me want to book a trip to Paris immediately. Perkins describes Paris and the attractions so well; I felt like I was there. The city became a character itself and it was the most incredible setting for this story.  I wish my review could do the setting justice, but I know I'm falling short....just know that it was picture perfect.<br /><br />Normally I will pass along books like this to my students, friends or families, but this one is special. It's going on my bookcase with some of my other favorite reads, which shows you just how much I LOVED this book!  Anna and the French Kiss shouldn't be missed this holiday season; I will be recommending it to all of my friends.  Also, I was so excited to hear that there will be two companion novels!  The first one is called Lola and the Boy Next Door, which will be out in late 2011 and Isla and the Happily Ever After, which will be published in late 2012.  After reading Perkins' debut, Anna and the French Kiss, I'll absolutely CANNOT wait to read these companion novels; in fact, I'll read anything that this talented author writes!e blossomed and evolved, which was one of the best parts of the book.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|Driving, treadmilling, chillin'  .... I've listened to this CD more than a dozen times since it arrived. All tracks. And then there is  Great Performances on PBS! Don't miss it!<br /><br />Whether you laugh at Hugh's performances with Stephen Fry on YouTube, or you watch \\"House\\",  or revel in his music, you have to admit this is one heck of a Renaissance Man. In addition, it's plain to see from interviews with him, he's a really nice guy who just happens to love performing and turns into a ham in front of an audience.<br /><br />If he'd come along several years ago, I could have been a Hugh Laurie groupie.
B004U52VPS|2.0|It's loads of fun building the levels; however, near impossible to win. The directions indicate to use the launcher about a foot away. If you lauch hard the birds shoot high, if you launch soft they drop dead flat. We generally shoot 2-3 feet away and launch hard. Only 1 in 5 shots actually land on the level. Not cool when the level allows for only 2 or 3 birds. There's zero consistancy in the sling-shot. We even tried adjusting the position of the bird in it, it doesn't matter because it never releases the same way twice. It was so very disappointing for us all. Needless to say, my 6 y/o son builds levels and uses his bean bag birds to knock 'em down. Great idea for a game but very poorly executed. Perhaps the birds should be made of a heavier material or the sling-shot could be more firm to actually \\"sling\\" the birds.
B003L77G6A|1.0|I bought the first three seasons and I must have appreciated them because I now am watching the fourth. It is excruciatingly boring. I watched the first three for Sheldon, and felt he deserved his Emmys. Now he has either 1) let success go to his head and is now phoning it in, 2) lacking a director, or 3) being directed by someone whose envy is unconsciously resulting in directorial sabotage. He is wincing, and prancing and screwing up his face in exaggerated ways and his previous naturalness seems forgotten. It's as if his evolution as an actor has reversed itself and we now see him at an early, inexperienced stage. So much indicating.  And Penny. -- Indicating City. Her range of expressions, with upper lip dumbly pushed forward, the same eye-rlling-type scornful looks, is limited. I've always thought she was severely miscast. And the character mis-drawn. She could have been an equally intelligent but uneducated yet socially ept person, yet she comes accross as just uneducated and sometimes embarassingly dumb -- this is not funny. Compare her requisite blond character with the Britta character on Community, a really smart and funny show. Britta is actually smart and portrays an extremely wide range of expressions and talent. Like the others on Community you get the impression her talents, and those of the production/writing staff, are limitless. I laugh a lot watching Community -- it's fresh and original, yet interweaves popular references such as old movies while not feeling the need to explain them -- it's chock-full of intellect and humor; but sitting in front of TBBT I just sit and look, getting angrier by the minute at my intelligence being disrespected, the way the characters are now disrespected by the writers, who seem to have studied up on 'sitcom shtick formulae'' and are just filling in the forms.  The producers obviously know the show isn't funny because they include a hilarious, raucous LAUGHTRACK  The plots are screamingly hackneyed. There is no science that anyone can understand. It's all on a 13-year old level of allusions to masturbation, size of one's penis and embarassingly exaggerated references to sex. Ignrant nerd sex.   Wouldn't it have been great if TBBT had seen itself as a partial vehicle for teaching physics, astronomy and engineering. As it is, we don't even know what 'the guys' are working on. As another low-star review points out, now we a supposed to laugh 'at' the charactters, not with them. I would add that whomever is running this show doesn't understand or hates science. (It is as if the current Congressional Republicans have usurped the reins of it.)
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I absolutely love this app, but it seems to provoke frequent lock-ups with my texting (HTC Incredible 1).  I can only get texting to work again by forcing swiftkey to stop, then its confounding to get swiftkey to start again.

I assumed the blu ray would have this.. But it's all audio... Be warned - you are not getting any album tracks performed live visually on DVD or blu ray. At this price - you really should have! Gutted.

B0011UF79C|5.0|I just watched this movie tonight for the first time. I never knew about this movie until a couple weeks ago. While looking for movies to watch i came across this movie and was immediately attracted to it. I have to say that there were some scenes that at times seemed too \\"ridiculous\\" in a sense that It was hard to believe. Spoiler alert!  like when the guy walked around without anyone noticing it was him they were looking for even though his picture was everywhere). It was also hard to believe that in those days with such technology Cops were not able to locate the guy on the wheelchair  you would think that in the future police will be able to track anyone anywhere.)It was also crazy the lack of technology. Having said this, I have to confess that I have realized that those things are not relevant in the purpose of the movie . I mean sure they could have done better things but let us not forget this movie came out in 1999  i believe). So it's understandable that \\"technology \\" was not shown on a higher level. At the same time those things I just explained, Do not interfere with the great message of this gem. I really love this movie , I love the fact that the main character is someone with a lot of disadvantages in his life yet he manages to become even better than those who had it easier. It's a inspiring movie because it teaches us that \\" where there is a will there is a way\\". In my life it inspires me to not give up on my dreams and to fight for what I believe to be true.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|Nice movie.  Much better than Revenge of the Fallen. Much better script with some nice historical twists. Better acting in general including the new girl. As for the blue-ray version of this movie it falls really short of what a blue-ray release should be and what customers are already used to. No extra disc with background information such as interviews, featurettes, deleted scenes, commentaries, bloopers, etc. No Digital Copy disc which is not necessarily a big deal but downloading a 2.24GB file is a bit too much for those of us with data caps from our internet providers (40GB in my case). Seems like a marketing strategy for a future trilogy release (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Bourne, Lord of The Rings, etc) which it is not fair to customers. In all a nice movie with better story and acting but an incomplete blue-ray release.
B000WCDI64|4.0|Amy is now deceased at age 27.  We will never know the heights which she may reached.  However, during her short life she provided a talented blend of vocal  productions.  During this DVD, her speech was not clear at times.  But her singing was some of her best.  Her song, \\"Rehab\\", was the most memorable because  of its quality, as well as her conflicted attitude toward full rehab.  I would recommend it to fans of Amy and persons who are interested in a unique blend of soul, blues, rock.
B0032KNA4I|2.0|What a complete utter utter load of bollocks!  The visual effects were good, in a computer graphic generated sort of fashion, but the over the top dramatics and the absolutely unbelievable plot line, not to mention the Americans being the \\"centre of the universe\\" as usual...... well what can I say.   It was patronising and offensive to just about every other country including China, Russia, the UK, India..... pathetic!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|This movie is most worthy of being called the best of the \\"Transformers\\" movies. Though im skeptical it will be the last.... this is the most serious of all the movies with the space race and the Apollo missions being a BIG focal point of the movie as the Cybertron war collides with earth (not to give too much away), but if you havn't seen this movie yet, im sure any fan will be very pleased here. The war for Cybertron collides with earth and enemies are on both sides and the phrase \\"more than meets the eye\\" takes a whole new meaning here... this is a great movie but has absolutely NO GOODIES :( it is just the movie. So are you willing to wait for the ultimate collector blu-ray/dvd/digital combo pack that is rumored to drop next month(Nov)???? Though I cant speak for all retailers I know my copy has a $10 off coupon for the ultimate edition. so I leave the decision up to you, the hopefully now somewhat informed consumer and \\"Transformers\\" fan... so I ask will you wait for the next release or give into the craving for \\"Transformers\\" mayhem and buy the movie now? either way im sure you will be pleased with this incredible event that is \\"Transformers Dark Of The Moon\\"
B003L77GRY|5.0|This show continues to entertain on many levels.  One f the most interesting aspects is how the writers develop new plots around Dexter's development as a person.  I hope this show continues on for several more seasons.
1594744769|3.0|I had this buzzed-about book on my list to read from the minute I heard of it. The background is so insanely cool, I couldn't help get excited. The author collects old photographs as a hobby. If you've ever been to a flea market or antique store and saw a box of unsorted vintage photos, this is what he collects. In particular, he became fascinated by strange photos (think \\"circus freaks\\" and camera tricks) and wrote stories about the people in them. Eventually, this morphed into the basis for his book, which includes vintage photos within the pages. It's a unique way of storytelling as some of the photos directly relate to the plot and even assist in the continuation of the story.   The story itself is about 16-year-old Jacob, who when he was younger, adored his grandfather's tall tales of living in a home with refugee children during the second world war. He showed Jacob pictures of the fantastically gifted children, which are the vintage photos the author found or borrowed from a collector. Jacob believed all of it until he was a teenager.   When Jacob's grandfather is mysteriously killed in the woods, he thinks he sees a monster lurking in the shadows. Left with his grandfather's cryptic last words, Jacob travels with his father to an island in Wales where the refugee children's home still stands. He finds the abandoned home and uncovers the mystery of the childhood stories.   The photos set you up for a creepy and dark tale, but it's not so much creepy or dark. It depends on what type of story you're looking for whether this is a plus or minus. I wanted the threat to be bigger and the sense of danger to feel more urgent. The writing is clever, and the photos take the storytelling to a visual level, but I was hoping the story would be a little more inventive. A few of the photos felt out of place, like aspects of the plot were written in to accomodate them rather than it being a natural inspiration. It's defnitely an interesting concept which stands out among other urban fantasy young adult fiction.

B003GDFQX4|5.0|Having recently been encouraged to use my wife's Kindle, (and enjoyed it), I decided to revisit this classic. I had forgotten just how good it is. The level of detail the author goes into is amazing and the tension he creates, as the net closes in, is fantastic. It's incredible that everyone knows he won't be successful but when you read it, you hope, that after all the effort, he might just do it. Also, Forsyth reveals a tremendous ironic twist in the way the manhunt started. A brilliant read.

B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|Little would anyone know what was yet to come. Dark Side of the Moon was just around the corner. Meddle sets the stage for the what was about to explode for Pink Floyd. It's also the album where PF comes into their own and finally finds themselves and developes the group's identity. It appears at first sight that Pink Floys finally moves out of the shadow of Syd Barrett. But the next four subsequent albums prove that Syd always lived within them and the Pink Floyd music.   There is no sense in breaking down the album. If you're clicking here you're probably familiar with the beautiful songs within it. I just wanted to state that 2011 remaster is done very well. The biggest things you'll notice is the lower noise floor and the added clarity. This makes for blacker backgrounds and more dynamics. Also, thankfully, the 2011 isn't compressed. Meaning this version level matches well with the previous CDs. So they didn't destroy the delicate nature of Echoes and the explosive parts of One of These Days. It also seems to be a bit more neutral and less bright. Overall, although not a dramatic change I feel the 2011 remaster of one of my all time favorite albums, Meddle, is worth having in your collection and deserving of a 5 star rating.

B004SBS8LA|3.0|This one is just ok. Not as good as the other Angry Birds. They probably were just trying to create more products and grow their brand, which is understandable. I'll probably delete at some point when all levels are beaten. Like other AB products it takes quite a bit of space.

B005CGI4EG|4.0|I received The complete series of Married with Children on Sept 27th. This is a great show, extremely funny. The only problem is that the packaging sucks. Sixteen Disks on two spirals. Only one sheet of paper with every episode in very small print that you peel off of the back of the box, but I got the entrie series for $35.00 on a pre-order sale, so even though I don't like the packaging it was well worth this bargain of a price. So many episodes I'll never get around to watching them all. I highly recommend this purchase. I did give it four stars instead of five because of the packageing, but considering your getting it for less than $5.00 a season, its a great deal.

B005AUWXZ0|1.0|I took my two year old son to Cars 2 as his first movie. We were so excited because Cars was his favorite movie and we all had been looking forward to seeing our first movie together as a family in the theater. Well, it started off decently but a bit violent. I am not one of those \\"opposed to all violence in movies and tv\\" kind of people but for a disney pixar movie clearly for very young kids, it was a bit much. My son was also disappointed that this movie was Mater-centric as he loved \\"Lightening McQueen\\" so much. Although my son is only two and didn't understand the plot, my wife and I were very angry. We are both tired of Hollywood pushing their far left agenda in movies and tv and pushing it so hard in a popular children's movie was too much for us. Fossil fuels and oil companies are not evil and \\"ethanol\\" is costly to our food supply and ineffective. I think there are some good forms of alternative energy and it is necessary for us to explore these options, but I digress. This movie portrays the oil industry as thugs and assassins and sends a bad message to kids.   Hollywood, we are tired of it. Stop the lies and the spreading of your radical left agenda. Leave our kids alone. I am quite the DVD/Blu-Ray collector and this is one film I refuse to buy.
B005EHNMWM|5.0|Wilco's \\"The Whole Love\\" is one of their best albums, period. I've been a fan since the beginning and have enjoyed every album, though I've always loved the \\"Summerteeth\\" through \\"Ghost is Born\\" period the most. This new creation reminds me why I fell in love in the 1st place. Jeff Tweedy's songwriting is top notch and the production is overwhelming, I recommend listening to it with headphones to be blown away. The ear candy is a plenty, and there are layers of sonic joys. I love it... Thank you Wilco, for making this for your fans!
B00004WG2F|4.0|To me, a classic movie is one of those that you can watch over and over throughout the years and STILL love it. LOTF is one of those movies. Everyone in the cast gave us a jewel of a performance. You love every member of the family and even when you get angry with Alfred, you understand that he was motivated out of anger and jealousy and you're grateful that he redeems himself at the end. I loved the fact that Isabel Two predicted that she would marry Tristan and lo and behold, she did. Julia Ormond and those long glorious locks was fantastic in this role. She is blessed to be able to convey chapters in just one expression - that is not something that MANY actresses can accomplish. Anthony Hopkins was awesome in this role, on and on and on. Just wonderful.
0451228375|5.0|Awesome, book I loved how it followed the four through their lives for about 30 years. I thought the best part of this book was how Follett, wrote about the Plauge which in he showed the destructiveness of the Plauge on society, and how after getting to know the charicters how said it was to see alot of the town die from it. And how you can see how it changed society.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I absolutley loved the first two books of this series,but this book I couldn't even finish. It got to the point when too many characters were dying.. I didn't like that. Basically the book is depressing and predictable because it's bomb after bomb and death after death. I have given up on this book!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is one of those books that will change your life forever. The four agreements are so simple to read and fallow. They make a huge diferance in the way you feel and relate to others. I wish they could teach them to kindergardeners in school. It would improve the culture so much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wouldn't have picked up this book unless if a complete stranger hadn't recomended it to me at the book store.. In the first ten pages or so it was hard to read and didn't seem like an interesting book, but soon got very exciting. I could not put the book down. The obstacles Katniss has to go through is horrific and is somewhat realistic to what a soldier goes through. VERY GOOD BOOK THAT KEEPS YOU HUNGRY FOR MORE!
B000H6SXMY|1.0|According to Amazon, If you cancel your order with a company on Amazon Marketplace straight after placing it, it is your right to have it cancelled.  Second Spin didn't share such enthusiasm and 2 days later, sent the item anyway despite numerous emails.  When you consider the fact that I live in Japan and would have to wait a month for it to arrive, you can understand my indifference..    The emails I received from the company seemed to be computer generated and served only to placate.  I thought of phoning, but no phone number.  I thought of writing, but no address.  This is going to take up to 3 months to fix when all that was required was a bit of customer service.  If you have a choice between companies, I think it may be wise to choose the other one - just in case.

It is quite complicated to set up and operate. If you just want to track down heart rate, time spent excersing and calories burned or just a general put on and go excercise watch this is not the gadget for you.

B005DZMODI|3.0|I don't want to belabour this, but the fact is that Eric Clapton is barely audible most of the time.  He is sitting in the background playing rhythm guitar, which is fine except that any weekend guitarist familiar with these songs could easily do the same.  Most of the guitar playing does not bare his distinctive stamp, because it is the songs themselves that are being showcased, followed by Marsalis' arrangements.  This is a good record, but it leans more towards New Orleans Jazz (at times it even sounds like Dixieland)than blues.  These songs are horned-up, jazz treatments of old blues songs.  It's an Eric Clapton project in-as-much as he played on the record and chose the songs...but really Marsalis and his band dominate the proceedings by 70%.    With all of this being said, the songs are good, the playing is good.  The recording quality leans towards being an \\"official bootleg\\".  There's very little separation, which makes me think that they used only a small number of microphones.  Maybe they were trying to recreate the way it was done in the 1930's?  I'm not sure.  But when you use a small number of microphones, it makes mixing more difficult in some ways.  As a Clapton fan, I would have been tempted to isolate his guitar playing in the mix and crank it up.  But, this is probably exactly what Eric DIDN'T want to see happen.  He is clearly taking a back seat to the songs and Wynton Marsalis.  My impressions of Marsalis?  He's smart and talented.  But...he strikes me as being a bit of an egomaniac, pretentious and perhaps a control freak.  He also seems fixated on the race issue.  Why bring it up?  Don't you think the music speaks for itself?  The liner notes seem to indicate that he has an axe to grind.  Let it go brother.  When people act like my equal, I am more inclined to treat them as such...When they start comlaining about how life has given them (or their people) a raw deal, this is when I see them as something lesser.  You demean and marginalize YOURSELF when you start griping.  Get off your soapbox and just F'n jam if you want people to respect you.  And if they STILL don't respect you, then it's their loss-don't distinguish other people's small-mindedness by carrying it around with you.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|As a Canadian watching this movie, I was shocked from the 1st segment to learn that some Americans resort to stitching themselves because they can't afford health insurance.  Who would have thought this would happen in the wealthiest country in the world?  I can say that I have never worried about getting the health care I have needed...the wait times can be frustrating, but I've always got what I have needed.  Being billed for an ambulance is beyond my comprehension.<br /><br />Michael Moore is at his best when he takes what is an obvious injustice, sorts through evidence, and makes a compelling case.  He did this with Bowling For Columbine.  The American health care system offers much material as it is so obvious to many in American and those of us around the world that not providing for the most vulnerable Americans is a national embarrassment.  Sicko punches it's point home with sarcasm, politicians making Moore's point for him with statements and speech clips, and statistics.<br /><br />This movie highlights a philosophical and moral question: should heatlh care delivery be based on a model of profit, or be a government provided service available to everyone through tax dollars? Where do America's values lie.....as a capalist society, how far will it go - will it allow it's people to go bankrupt because of a health care bill?  There are no easy answers - America's politics reflected through it's values are conflicting, on one hand valuing individualism, another community.<br /><br />Moore does a superb job in answering these questions and making the point that a government that includes a sense of community by supplying health care to everyone is far better off.  It is a tragedy that so many poor Americans vote directly against there best interests by voting Republican - fear, patriotism and religion are used to draw them.  The passage of Obama's bill can be credited in part to this movie - \\"pre-existing\\" is used much more often than it was before the film was made.<br /><br />This is a brilliant film and a gift to everyone in America whether they realize it or not.film and a gift to everyone in America whether they realize it or not.
1609611543|3.0|the first few chapters talk about how wheat is a problem in the modern diet.  but the anti-wheat argument sort of trickles away before the author is able to convincingly prove that wheat alone is the problem.  in the second half of the book, he stops referring to wheat as the problem and veers into all-too-familiar talk about the low-carb paleo diet; he replaces talk about wheat with talk about carbs and sugars, etc., etc.  i have done a lot of reading on paleo/primal diets, and i feel that this book is just another spin on that whole theory.  though i appreciate the health benefits of the paleo/primal way of eating, i am not convinced that a diet that focuses on meat is the best choice for our individual health nor the health of our planet.  also, as a native milwaukeean, i didn't appreciate his easy jab at milwaukee as a city of overweight people.  all urban areas have problems with obesity, access to healthy food and the like, not just milwaukee.  actually, when one studies the statistics, milwaukee isn't too bad when compared against similar cities across the nation.  enough with the stereotypes.

B004P8JPS6|4.0|I have been a die-hard fan of Jack Reacher for a long time now.  I have matured with him, and have loved the fact that he was just a bit older than the typical tough-guy hero.  So it was with a bit of trepidation that I (figuratively speaking) picked up this book and began to read.  I will grudgingly admit that Child proved me somewhat wrong by turning out a novel that, while not his best, was still surprisingly creative.  The ending was a bit of a surprise; I applaud Mr. Child's ability to continue to keep the reader just a bit off-balance.  Perhaps not quite the level of character development we're used to, but enough to keep me turning the pages.  He briefly brings back a character that has appeared in earlier works -- Neagle is an enigmatic past partner with plenty of unexplained personal baggage that has left her unable to tolerate human touch, and yet she has formed a unique bond with Reacher, and their interaction is always interesting.  I only wish she'd played a larger part.  A future novel pairing the two of them would be a wonderful thing...  All in all, I enjoyed this latest offering, but don't think it was Child's best work. Nevertheless... Child's worst is still better than just about anyone else's best.  Final comment:  Tom Cruise to play Reacher in a movie???  You have GOT to be kidding... Cruise is, well, shall we say 'vertically-challenged', couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and has about as much charisma as a bottle of mouthwash.  Just my personal opinion.  Casting could have been way better...in fact, casting a big, brawny newcomer in this role would have been a much wiser choice, if for no other reason than that Jack is unique amongst fictional characters and deserves to be portrayed by someone who doesn't bring to the screen any preconceived personas.

B004AYCWY4|3.0|I vacillated in my 20s between evolution and creation, and at present accept creation. I want to know if evidence for evolution is as strong as is claimed. So I borrowed Dawkins' book Greatest Show from the library, and read it right through. It was an enjoyable read if a bit slow in parts. The biological facts that I learned in it were alone well worth the read, particularly the description of the development from zygote to embryo. But did it present a good case for evolution?  Evolutionary gradualism  Dawkins spends a number of pages conveying the feel of evolution, inviting the reader to imagine the immense chains of inheritance that link every living thing. In each generation parent and child are almost indistinguishable, but the accumulation of small differences accounts for all the variety we see in living things. This is elegant darwinian gradualism.  But at the end of the third chapter, he finishes on a note that demolishes the moment. He discusses dog breeding and asks the reader to consider the differences that have been achieved in dogs over the past few centuries, \\"then extrapolate backwards twenty thousand times as far into the past. It becomes rather easy to accept that evolution could accomplish the amount of change that it took to transform a fish into a human\\".  Not so fast. In dog breeding, from an original wolf-like population, we have achieved the range of breeds by concentrating recessive characteristics and a few disadvantageous mutations. You can go from genetically rich wolves to highly specialized poodles, but not the other way round. Genetic variety has been lost in each of the separate breeds and they are genetic dead ends, more prone to disease and often dependent on human intervention for their continuation. Much of what is presented as part of this great continuum of evolution can more naturally be explained as variations of available genetic material or in some cases minor mutations, or even the effects of epigenetics, all of which arelimited in how far they can remodel a population.  Dawkins speaks of the million or billion fold range of speeds that evolution shows, sometimes very fast, other times almost imperceptibly slow. Maybe there is in fact only fast evolution - when pre-existing variety is shuffled around as in dog breeding. The slow evolution may be just erroneous interpretation of the fossils.  A couple of challenges  I was hoping the book would get straight down to business in presenting the current biological knowledge that clearly discriminates between the 2 competing theories of origin, but it took until about page 100 before he presented facts that challenge creationist belief - stratigraphic sorting of the fossils. He says \\"Do certain kinds of fossils, for example mammals, appear only after a given date, never before? The answer is ... always Yes. No exceptions\\". This is a bit awkward for a creationist. If Noah's flood is the explanation, one might expect some general pattern with some mixing at the boundaries and a few exceptions.  Yet the evolutionary story is not straightforward either. Fish were at first thought to date back to 420 million years ago, then in the 1950s the date for earliest first was put back to 470 mya; then in the 1990s to 490 mya; then in China in 1999 fish were found in the Lower Cambrian, making them 510-540 million years old. Each such case means an unexpected redrawing of the tree of life and less time for them to evolve. Neither theory of origins seems to have a good handle on the fossils.  The only other challenge to the creationist point of view that I felt from the book was the distribution of animals - there is no convincing way to explain what I thought was the fact that Australia and only Australia is characterized by both living and extinct marsupials. Except that it turns out that there are marsupials living in New Guinea, Indonesia and South America. And the metatherians, ancestors/relatives of the marsupials, are found only in Eurasia and North America. So it's a mystery either way.  The information age is upon us  Despite taking pains to point out that the genome is not an architectural blueprint, Dawkins tends to refer to evolution as being about organisms changing size and shape, as Darwin viewed it. In discussing the length of the giraffe laryngeal nerve, he says \\"the giraffe neck slowly lengthened over evolutionary time\\". He even introduces the reader to Haldane's unit of the rate of evolution called the darwin, which is a rate of increase in length.  But in this age of molecular biology the locus of evolution is the genome, which is seen as the recipe or computer program for the embryonic development of the organism and for its functioning at the cellular level. Small changes in genes can cause large changes in appearance. Evolution now needs to be understood in terms of information theory, protein sequence space and islands of viability. The questions that need to be answered are How do new features appear? What levels of complexity can be expected to arise from mutations and selection?  The simple darwinian view endorsed by Dawkins is that mutations that are negative will be weeded out by natural selection, and positive mutations will be accumulated, and those accumulations will lead to novel, increasingly complex life forms. The ID response is that this could not happen in DNA, as it does not in more familiar software engineering: any non-trivial changes in software require a number of coordinated modifications, each of which is useless by itself and would not be maintained by natural selection.  Lenski's long term experiment  Dawkins acknowledges the importance of this question, but limits his evidence to Richard Lenski's brilliant long-term experiment with E. coli, discussed over 15 pages, calling it \\"a beautiful demonstration of evolution in action\\".   Lenski, a professor of biology at Michigan State University, and his team have been breeding 12 simultaneous lines of the bacterium since 1988. Each day they transfer for each line a hundredth part of the beaker they were growing in to a fresh beaker of the liquid nutrition. That nutrition is a concentrated solution of glucose, which E Coli digests readily, and citrate, which it doesn't digest in the oxygenated environment of Lenski's flasks.   Given the number of bacteria produced an the rate of mutation in DNA, every possible mutation should have occurred several times over the life of the project. A number of single-point mutations occurred that increased the rate the bacteria could grow on the glucose. The most spectacular result so far is that that one of these lines, after about 10 years, acquired the ability to digest citrate. The biochemistry is not yet understood, but it apparently required just 3 nucleotides to change, and the first of those appears to have conferred some other benefit. After about 50,000 generations so far - equivalent to a million years in human terms - with populations in the billions, this is the most impressive thing that has arisen.   How can we expect whole new functioning proteins to arise, with hundreds or thousands of nucleotides required, when evolution relies on this sort of close-range scatter-gun process? Lenski's experiment is not quite the ringing endorsement Dawkins sees it as, but the appearance of citrate digestion did spook some creationists, including the lawyer Andrew Schlafly, founder of the Conservapedia website. He engaged Lenski in correspondence but was not qualified for the task of assessing the research. Greatest Show happily quotes insults from PZ Meyers about Schlafly, but no scientifically qualified commentators are mentioned. Michael Behe has commented on this sort of thing and his book the Edge of Evolution is related to this area, but Dawkins limits himself to the soft target.  In fact, the way this works as evidence for evolution is that such small beneficial mutations are supposed to accumulate over time and create significantly new types of organism. Yet in in 2010 Behe published a paper examining the literature for known beneficial mutations and found they result nearly always from \\"loss or modification of a pre-existing molecular function\\". Since these are the mutations that can be fixed, the overall trend will be for loss of function. We don't yet have a mechanism for evolution.  Tracing inheritance in the molecular age  Dawkins makes another appeal to molecular biology in the chapter \\"The Tree of Cousinship\\", in saying \\"What Darwin didn't - couldn't - know is that the comparative evidence becomes even more convincing when we include molecular genetics, in addition to the anatomical comparisons that were available to him\\". He confidently asserts: \\"Detailed DNA comparisons will fill in all the gaps in our knowledge about the actual evolutionary relatedness of every species to every other: we shall know with complete certainty the entire family tree of all living creatures.\\"    But numerous molecular studies contradict the tree of life model. Dawkins doesn't mention these problems at all. Here are a few recent examples.   * In Biology Direct, a paper dated 23/8/2011, entitled \\"The public goods hypothesis for the evolution of life on Earth\\", says \\"It is becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile the observed extent of horizontal gene transfers with the central metaphor of a great tree uniting all evolving entities on the planet.\\"  * In Genetic Archaeology,  an article from February 2011 entitled \\"Discovery of jumping gene cluster tangles tree of life\\", invokes the phenomenon of gene transfer to explain why 23 genes exist in two species of fungus but not their common ancestor. It suggests dropping the tree of life idea: \\"a different metaphor, such as a mosaic, may be more appropriate\\".   *  A ScienceDaily article dated Jan. 26, 2011, \\"Genetic Archaeology Finds Parts of Human Genome More Closely Related to Orangutans Than Chimps\\" coming almost immediately after the sequencing of the orang-utan genome, quotes the publisher of the paper they are reviewing saying \\"In about 0.5% of our genome, we are closer related to orangutans than we are to chimpanzees, and in about 0.5%, chimpanzees are closer related to orangutans than us.\\" This is despite the understanding that chimps diverged from us less than 7 million years ago, and orang-utans 14 million.   * In \\"Trends in Ecology & Evolution\\", of 23 March 2009 an article called \\"Gene tree discordance, phylogenetic inference and the multispecies coalescent\\", stated \\"conflicting genealogical histories often exist in different genes throughout the genome.\\"  * From the same journal a 1999 article \\"Molecular phylogenies become functional\\" states \\"the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene implied...an absurd phylogeny of mammals, regardless of the method of tree construction. Cats and whales fell within primates, grouping with simians (monkeys and apes) and strepsirhines (lemurs, bush-babies and lorises) to the exclusion of tarsiers. Cytochrome b is probably the most commonly sequenced gene in vertebrates, making this surprising result even more disconcerting\\".  Junk DNA  Dawkins considers pseudogenes - gene-like sequences that don't code for proteins - to be junk DNA, inferring that the unguided process of evolution leaves useless gene copies cluttering the genome. He says \\"a pseudogene [is] a gene that does absolutely nothing\\". Yet in the March 11, 2011 edition of RNA Journal the article \\"Pseudogenes: Pseudo-functional or key regulators in health and disease?\\" states \\"Pseudogenes have long been labeled as \\"junk\\" DNA, failed copies of genes that arise during the evolution of genomes. However, recent results are challenging this moniker; indeed, some pseudogenes appear to harbor the potential to regulate their protein-coding cousins. ... We ... explore the role of pseudogenes in the increasingly complex web of noncoding RNA that contributes to normal cellular regulation.\\"  The design of the eye  In one of the last chapters of Greatest Show, Dawkins invokes the famous argument from bad design, calling the human eye \\"the design of a complete idiot\\" because the photocells in our retinas have the light-sensitive end pointing away from the lens. \\"Natural selection\\", he says, \\"came along after the big original error of installing the retina backwards, and restored it to a high-quality precision instrument.\\"  But there is a good design reason to have the light-receptors to the back, and there is a mechanism for dealing with the subsequent distortion of incoming light. The retina needs strong blood flow to keep working, to avoid degeneration and to ensure the photoreceptors regenerate, and for cooling. This blood supply is provided by the opaque choroid, which lies necessarily behind the photoreceptors, to avoid blocking the light. On the other side of the photoreceptors, the nerve cells protrude into the eye but are nearly transparent.  To compensate for any distortion from those nerve cells, there are in the eye the Müller glial cells attached to the neurons in the retina, which gather light and guide it toward the light receptors, correcting for chromatic aberration and filtering out unwanted frequencies.  The eye is a very sophisticated and delicate mechanism, and it would be more appropriate to regard it with awe rather than scoff at its supposed bad design.  Conclusion  Dawkins is very good at explaining observational science, and I hope he produces more of it. But the area of the origin of life in all its variety is a matter of speculation, with a heavy burden of ramifications for world view. Dawkins has clearly stated his preference for atheism, so he is obliged to support an unguided mechanism. This book is a collection of facts that he interprets from an evolutionary point of view, but overall they don't make the case for evolution and against creation that that book promises.

All the other reviewers have given a pretty good synopsis of this book so I will keep this short, and say try a sample of it on your reader, you won't be disappointed.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book - the characters are wonderfully funny and you'll root for them from the beginning. I love the author's sense of humor and the way she writes Rose's perspective as she experiences life will absolutely grab you by the heart and not let go. I had heard lots of great buzz about this story online and was more than willing to give it a shot for the ridiculously low price of the Kindle version - you won't regret this one. It's a fun ride with a leading man that will have you wanting more. I can't wait for the next installment. And I can't stop saying \\"Crappy doodles!\\"
0142000671|3.0|Thought of as one of the great novellas of our time Of Mice and Men promised much. I never read this in school; but I have read Steinbeck, especially the masterful Grapes of Wrath. This entire story takes place in about 24 hours. We are warned early of Lennie's great strength and his mental slowness and every act in the book leads to his death at the hand of his friend George at the end.   In one scene in the middle of the book Lennie and George begin to realize their dream of owning a farm only to see it dashed about 20 pages later. I just didn't care. I certainly had a hard time picturing Lennie; a man so strong he can crush a man's hand in his own and snap necks by accident. I also have never known anybody with Lennie's type of mental problems before. Learning disabilities are varied and complex. Lennie was described in a way that I had no reference point, I just couldn't picture the character. Being so short there was little time for me to develop a love and interest in the characters and their destinies. Lennie and George felt very two dimensional in a character-driven drama.
B002ZG99TK|3.0|The title says it all, Another movie about a run away train. I was never on the edge of my seat during this movie, The movie left me feeling like haven't i seen this story line before with different actors? I don't think this movie was up for any awards in the US at least.

0385523394|2.0|Her perspective could have been fabulously written. I wanted to hear more about her peers in the prison. Instead, we got constant reminders that she is pretty and educated and everyone loved that about her. As a reader, I know that she is a privileged woman but the constant reminders were unnecessary. It made her appear either conceited or, on the other side, insecure.   This book had a lot of potential had the focus been shifted slightly. It was difficult to finish simply due to the ego of the author not because of the content.
B000000WFU|5.0|This album is truly inspirational.  The singing is wonderful and the melodies will haunt you with their beauty.  I would recommend this for anyone who needs some calm in their lives.
B00466HN86|5.0|If you have seen all the other movies put out by Sherwood Baptist church, then you will not be dissapointed. This one was by far their best! We saw this movie on the opening night and greatly enjoyed it. It will make you laugh and cry and clap at the end! Fantastic movie with great acting! Hard to believe the actors are just regular people like us all. Once again the Kendrick's have put together a wonderful family movie that is a must for your home library. Can't wait for when it comes out on DVD so I can purchase some copies to give away! You will love this movie!
B003HC8I5M|4.0|I think this is probably a good time in Phil's musical career to release an album like \\"Going Back\\". When it comes to music, Phil has virtually done it all in his day. For decades we have heard him talk about his love of Motown and how much this music inspired him. If Motown is responsible for influencing Phil Collins to write and perform all those fabulous songs that he graced us with over all these years, then why shouldn't we feel good about Phil wanting to pay tribute to Motown now? When you listen to Phil on these songs, you can plainly hear that he put his heart and soul into these songs. Now, it is Motown music and admittedly it's not for everyone. But that's a broad statement -- no music is for everyone. If you like Motown, you should like this CD. I have seen reviews on Amazon complaining that Phil has done nothing new with these songs, but I don't think he intended to do anything new. This is his tribute to Motown...the way he remembered the songs. No, they are not the originals, but Phil never advertised them as such. These are very professional and personal remakes of some of Phil's favorite Motown songs. My favorite song on this album is the title track, \\"Going Back\\". I'm not a big Motown fan and I won't be playing this CD every week, but I will appreciate what Phil did on this album every time I do listen to it.  Phil is older now than when he wrote \\"In The Air Tonight\\" and all of his many big hits from the '80s and '90s, but he is still a very talented singer, songwriter and performer. I learned that our tastes in music change as we get older, which is not always a bad thing. Phil Collins was always my favorite performer since the 1970s when I first learned about Genesis. Despite my deep admiration for Phil, I sadly slammed him pretty badly on my review of his \\"Testify\\" album, which I think was released in 2002. Back then, I thought that album was completely boring and uninteresting. It's now been about 9 years since I did that review and I'm severalmonths away from turning 50 years old. My music preferences have changed over those 9 years. I am proud to say that I now listen to Phil's \\"Testify\\" CD very frequently and it has actually become one of my favorites. I wanted to throw that out there to offer my opinion that, as the \\"Testify\\" album was for me, I think \\"Going Back\\" will most probably appeal more to the older crowd out there. I am personally quite glad that I bought the \\"Going Back\\" CD, because I consider it a special gift from Phil Collins to us all. And...he did a bang-up job with it!
0385344325|5.0|I had been waiting for this book and I have not been disappointed.  Lee Child is an excellent writer and I love the character that he has created, Jack Reacher.  In this book, we travel back to 1997 to discover why Reacher left the army that was his home for so many years.  Not only is that mystery solved for devoted followers but we are also taken on another wild ride of twists and turns in a wonderfully plotted mystery.  The reader is taken into the world of a small town in rural Mississippi where the economy revolves around an army base.  And military politics are laid bare for the reader to ponder.  And always remember what a different world we lived in before 9-11.  I enjoyed the dropped hints about Reacher's brother Joe and Margrave, Georgia from The Killing Floor which was the first Jack Reacher book...the readers know that as soon as this book ends Reacher heads to Georgia for the adventure in the first book of the series.<br /><br />Excellent book particularly if you are a Reacher fan.  Even if you have never read a Reacher book, this is a perfect place to start...guaranteed you will be hooked.  Hope we don't have to wait a full year for the next one!
0802130208|3.0|I was neither blown away by this cult classic as many reviewers were, nor was I turned off by its unusual characters and singular plot twists.<br /><br />Ignatius Reilly is one of those memorable characters of literature -- one who chooses to live in an alternative reality rather than the real world, one who wants the world to conform to him rather than conforming to the world. In that respect he is similar to Melville's Bartleby, Cervantes' Don Quixote, and similar classic types. One never knows what he is going to do, what bizarre demonstration he will lead, what strange letter he will write, what paroxysm of self-assertion he will undergo.<br /><br />However, it may be the manner of narration, but this book just didn't \\"grab\\" me till halfway through. It seemed episodic, and some of the minor characters were overwrought and overwritten. So, only three stars for a book that many consider either great or sorely lacking.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|My 3-year-old LOVES this movie, and I honestly don't mind watching it over and over and over again. As a native New Orleanian, I love the setting, and the music is wonderful, especially the opening number by Dr. John. Tiana is a Disney princess I can handle, and I don't mind my princess-crazed preschooler playing dress up and pretend around this role model who works hard for what she wants. It has a few scary parts, but my very fraidy daughter has learned to watch them without any problem after watching the movie several times. I don't bother to fast forward, and she doesn't need to cover her eyes. This movie is a hidden Disney gem.
0061914177|2.0|I must say, the only reason I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1 is for the fact that he wrote the whole book, and decided to recite it to us as well.<br /><br />By no means do I mean to be a pessimistic critic, but I bought this book after seeing it recommended with The 4 Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss. Hoping that it would make a compelling argument and have a stint of useful information, the audiobook was not only dull and vague on all topics discussed, but I found the author's voice offending and brash.<br /><br />I have read multiple books on the subject of \\"niche\\" marketing and making passive income revolving around your \\"passion,\\" but I found this audiobook unimpressive and almost condescending to better written books. I had to stop this audiobook multiple times to digest the nonsensical crap that I was listening to. I am glad that a handful of internet marketers have created products worth consuming, and subsequently made millions, but to describe the road to these successes is tedious, and this book basically outlines a bunch of \\"power words,\\" (passion, DNA, etc) that just sound good and make it seem easy. The audiobook seemed like jargon (and he admits he dictated the book to have a ghostwriter complete it) and didn't make valid points. Instead, a book is better off explaining the steps to achieve twitter, Facebook, social media success.<br /><br />Not only that, it's annoying and self righteous to write a book that only portrays the glamour, without saying anything original or noteworthy.<br /><br />This book was marketed well (74 reviews(audiobook) and 4.5 stars), but anyone is better off reading The 4 Hour Work Week 2 times and saving your money.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|When Tess goes missing Bee returns to London to search for her. Details are revealed quickly - she had just given birth to a baby who died immediately so when her body is found in an apparent suicide only Bee refuses to believe it. She soon loses her fiance, her job, and nearly her mind as she begins looking for clues to what really happened to her sister.<br /><br />I agree with what another reviewer wrote - I didn't see the ending coming at all (mostly, there was one scene where the warning bells were going off in my head and shortly thereafter my fears were confirmed!). While I thought it a clever way to end the story I also felt a little unsatisfied by it.<br /><br />The story moves at a good pace and as information is revealed you keep wondering who is involved, who is innocent and who might be guilty. As a sister I can only imagine how crazy I would become searching for the person who hurt her, and the author conveys Bee's feelings - panic, love, guilt, shame - for her sister very well.<br /><br />All in all, a good read!
B002I0J5FG|4.0|I was hesitant to buy the Team Ico collection. I had never played Ico, and in fact, I had generally stayed away from it mostly due to crushing expectation given to it from critics and fans (\\"Breathtaking!\\" \\"This game is art!\\" and the like). To each his own, sure, but the game had fanboy stink all over it. I had once owned \\"Shadow of the Colossus,\\" but wasn't nearly as impressed as others, and traded it in soon thereafter.  But, as both games together were $39.99, I decided to purchase them, to see if maybe I had missed the boat on them the first time around. And the answer to that is...kind of.   Anyway, let me review each game separately:  ICO:  Ico is a nice 3rd-person game in which you control a boy who is attempting to escape from a castle-like structure. On the way, you encounter another person, the affable Yorda. Much of the game has you figuring out how to get Yorda to follow you to the exit of rooms, often by taking her hand and dragging her behind you. Honestly, this is a fantastic idea for a game, and it should have been a slam dunk. But, it's just a lay-up in the end, which does score, but doesn't wow.  The problem? The game is way too short. I don't want to call it easy, per se, but it's just too short. A beginning player (like myself) will beat the game in 4-5 hours, with absolutely no outside help. There is actually a trophy for beating the game in 2 hours or less, so that tells you what you need to know. As the second title of a $19.99 collection, this is OK, but I would have been gravely disappointed if I had spent full price on this in 2001, particularly alongside other games like MGS2 and FFX.  This game (as well as its \\"sequel\\") sells itself on its art and ambience. Atmosphere is everything, and it's pretty nice. The game is very quiet, which makes sense given the nature of what you're trying to accomplish. Control is mostly OK, although Ico will do strange stuff sometimes (particularly when jumping). There was one particularly annoying segment (involving a water wheel) where I felt control really got in the way, but mostly, I thought it was OK.  The music in the game is OK, but not stellar. I know some people rave about it, but I found it to be mostly throwaway (and paling in comparison to its counterpart, SotC). The visuals are pretty dated. I'm not even sure how they compare with contemporaries (it's hard to compare with my FFX, e.g., as that game has yet to be released in HD). But in the end, I was disappointed that I beat the game in one night.  All in all, the game gets decent ratings for fun, but the length hurts it overall.  Fun: 4 stars  Overall: 3 stars  Shadow of the Colossus:  This game, when it goes, is one of the most fun games I've ever played. Unfortunately, often, it goes nowhere.  The premise of this game is simple: there are 16 colossal giants out there, and you've got to beat them all down. At its core, this game pits you against a monster, one on one. Each monster has one (or several) \\"vital point(s)\\", which is the only place to deal damage. Unfortunately, you are often the size of an ant compared to these towering creatures, and so you've got to figure out how to get to these vital points. And man, is that fun. Each and every battle is memorable, and no two battles are the same. Some people might complain that there are only 16 battles, but with the originality present in each one, I can't number myself among them.  The story is mostly throwaway, regarding some guy (with the name of Wander - nothing like subtlety) who wants to raise a girl (I don't remember her name, and am not sure if we're ever told who she is) back from the dead, and so ventures to the \\"Forbidden Land\\". Most of this is told to you in the opening sequence. I still do not understand this stuff about \\"breaking bounds in storytelling none of us knew existed\\" (to quote a review from the games original release). There's not much here - I can't imagine how people feel much emotion for the mostly-mute main character, or thedead girl, etc. etc. Imaginations run wild, I guess. I did think of my own story to follow the game, but it's a little silly and...racy for Amazon. However, I will give credit where it's due: there are some cool visual effects in the game, which loosely tie to the \\"story\\". As you kill colossi, your character seems to become...corrupted. He starts off looking like some silly anime character, but looks incredibly cool by the end.  If there is one thing that draws an emotional response, it is the amazing music. I admit - I DID miss the boat on this one. The music in this game is stellar, and has not aged one bit. Battles with colossi, which are already outstanding, become epic due to the soundtrack. When that music changes its sound, you know that you are doing well. At times, it put me on the edge of my seat, literally.  There is one huge problem with this game, however. While the battles against the 16 colossi are epic, the part in-between is anything but. At BEST, you can hunt for lizards and fruit. At worst? You are traveling for long stretches with no real landmarks, no music, and no fun. The travel segments are among the worst I've ever seen in a video game. I can understand the loner feeling that the developer was trying to convey, but it's just too much. Exacerbating the situation is the horrible control for the horse. I can't even begin to describe this utter failure, but let's just say - you'll hit buttons much more trying to spur the horse than for every battle combined. However, I will say that overall, the control seems better than when I played the game a few years back - with the exception of the horse, which is just as bad today.  The visuals of this game hold up even today. The graphics remain amazing. Also, this game is longer than its predecessor, but some of that is due to the travel time. Even with that, you can beat this game in less than 10 hours.  If there was just a little more to this game, it would be 5-stars all around. The fun factor when fighting the colossi is still 5-star stuff. But the terrible travel filler brings the overall score down. So,   Fun: 5 stars  Overall: 4 stars
B0045JEPXU|4.0|A good CD.  Songs on radio are hits for a reason. A few songs are a little weird like the first one \\"Mr. Worldwide\\".
B005D0RDIE|5.0|After viewing on VH1 I wish the dvd would contain backstage footage before concert  fan interviews of course\\"The proffesor\\" is worth the price of dvd alone- I wish this US release was at MSG but understand why they filmed Cleveland. Donna Halper must be  very pleased. I can't wait to see what Scot & Sam have done- I hopoe it is as well made as Beyond the lighted Stage! I almost was called to film this concert for SRO/Anthem.They sound  looks promising! Next Time !!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This first season was great but too short.  I'll be looking forward to the full second season very soon!  I'm not really into the zombie genre but this show was pretty good.
B005DZMP00|5.0|Totally worth the wait. Every song on here is smoking. \\"Greatest Story Ever Told\\" & \\"Deal\\" are not to be skipped over. Probably the best version of \\"Good Lovin'\\" ever, period! Disc 2 gives us an hour long \\"Dark Star\\"/\\"Other One\\" jam and a face melting \\"Not Fade Away\\" and \\"GDTRFB\\". Don't have to be a hardcore Deadhead to enjoy these tracks, just a fan of solid live music.
0679720200|4.0|Definitely a good book and worthwhile read. I recommend it and it is not too long for those who do not like lengthy stories.
0525423281|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews saying that Lola and the Boy Next Door was amazing, but it didn't quite live up to Anna and the French Kiss. I have to disagree! Don't get me wrong, I gave Anna a 5 star rating too, but I loved loved loved Lola!!! Lola has to deal with some grittier issues than Anna did, and I just totally adored Cricket. For me, Stephanie Perkins took her writing and her characters to a whole different level than Anna and the French Kiss. This book did not disappoint, and I can't wait for Isla and the Happily Ever After.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Fritz Reiner continues to amaze me with his magic, magnificent, and monumental interpretations of classical music. While I've been a constant listener of Dr. Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra through the years, it's not been until recently (close study of his  recordings) that I've discovered just how great this man really was.<br />Despite all the negative remarks that continue to surface, even 50 years after his death, Reiner is in a class by himself. No one, and I mean no one comes close to the passion he creates and transfers to the members of the orchestra. To wit: My latest purchase. Rimsky-Korsakov's \\"Scheherazade.\\" This recording, including the last movement which is \\"untouched, unedited, and unheard of in recorded music,\\" along with the break-neck speed at which I'm sure Nikolai would have approved of, leaves one breathless. The soloist, the orchestra, and Dr. Reiner have created, for the ages, a recording that takes the listener on a magic carpet ride, and gradually lifts us to heights never imagined. The ending, the violin solo . . . how soft, how lovely the carpet drifts away. One must, as I did, play it again. Dr. Reiner's recording is more than \\"A Thousand and One Nights,\\" it's \\"A Million More.\\"
B000JMKQX0|5.0|There is nothing more that a person can say then just simply AWESOME!  Stories all around the world it had something for everyone!
B00509CRG6|5.0|\\"There are no longer any great jobs where someone else tells you precisely what to do.\\" - one of the best lines in the book. Makes you think how you can do better at your workplace.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Just got this movie the other day.  I had enjoyed it so much in the movie theater this summer--I couldn't wait to get it home and play it on my own big screen LED (which IMO delivers much more clarity and pop then the high-tech/Digital large cinema screens) and my 5.1 surround sound system.  Transformers: Dark of the Moon 2D Blu-ray video, audio, and surround sound effects did not disappoint.  I highly recommend this movie as one of the best thrill-ride movies out of the summer 2011 lineup for your home library.   However, be warned this movie is rather sparse on \\"plot\\" and \\"story line\\"( It didn't go over well with the majority of critics).  IMO this movie is more about crazy, over-the-top audio and visual special effects aka, F-U-N.  My only disappointment is that the 3D version is not yet for sale for some reason.  However, my package came with a $10 off coupon for whenever the 3D version comes out.  I'll reserve my opinion/comments on this tactic until I see how much it might cost me to purchase the 3D version using this enclosed $10 coupon) Until then, I'll just use the 2d-3d conversion button on my TV when I want to see this $19.99 2D movie in 3D.
B0019N94X6|4.0|Great movie, looks superb on Blu Ray and I love the steelbook case. Haven't watched the original Scarface, but not really interested in it anyway. I am satisfied, good purchase.
B00062IDCO|5.0|I know I've said this for Seasons 5 and 6, but we sure focus on episodes around the Doctor and/or Seven this season.  Season 7 is kinda weird, in the fact that obviously being the last season, there are things that happen that really throw the crew off course, namely \\"Workforce I and II\\" and \\"Drive\\".  On the plus side for focusing so heavily on those two characters, it's nice to see that we really stretch out their characters, to see just how human a Hologram and a former Borg can be.  The best episodes this season include \\"Unimatrix Zero II,\\" \\"Imperfection,\\" \\"Shattered,\\" \\"Repentance,\\" \\"The Void,\\" \\"Q2,\\" \\"Renaissance Man,\\" and of course the Series Finale \\"Endgame.\\"  To touch on some of this, \\"Shattered\\" is a great story, that takes us to various pasts and futures of Voyager, with Commander Chakotay being the only person able to safely traverse the ship.  \\"The Void\\" continues the story from \\"Night\\" in Season 5, but much darker.  Q returns with his son in \\"Q2\\" and Endgame is masterful piece of work. Sort of like \\"All Good Things,\\" in a way.
B005HEUF0Y|5.0|Yes, as everyone says, absolutely great production.  Tears, joy, love, something unimaginable.  Personally I feel this particular Star Trek, NG was the best of all the various renditions it went through.  NG was an example of an archetype of our being, the wise old man, the warrior, the psychic, the healer.  I personally think this series was close to enlightenment (in the later presentations anyway when they worked out interpersonal warmth.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|While I love this app I liked it a lot more before the update....since the update it takes longer to open and kindle logo nolonger appears.
1594744769|5.0|I loved this book, i purchased it for myself as i like to read lot's of different things, both adult and kid's works. Two of my young family members who hardly ever pick up a book, but prefer to play xbox games or the like, asked me about the book i had not put down for 3 days. I explained the story line to them and showed them the very interesting pictures/photos inside. Once i had finished reading it, they both battled with each other to be the next to read it.  It was lovely to see them read this book from cover to cover, and then ask me if a second book would be coming out, as they enjoyed it so much and wanted to know more of what happens next.  Any author who can keep the kids away from video games and the computer for a while is fantastic in my eyes, i can't wait to see if there will be a second book, as i want to read more of this great story myself, and the kids are also hooked back on reading now, so the benefit for all concerned was fantastic. A great book, with lot's to offer all ages.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|In Boston's Charlestown neighborhood, robbing banks and armored cars is a cottage industry. This is the story of one of The Town's Gen X crews. This crew is good.   The movie opens with a -- you guessed it -- bank robbery. The bad guys are wearing masks and everything goes according to plan -- until the crew's hothead loses his composure, attacks a bank employee and kidnaps another.   This was not part of the plan.  The kidnapped employee is let go, physically unharmed, but the crew discovers she lives in The Town. Did she see something or hear someting that could identify them to the FBI? Will she recognize one of them at a local pub, laundromat or grocery store and call the police? The crew's ramrod decides to find out, before the crew's hothead solves the problem with murder. Problem is, Ramrod falls in love with the vic.   This was not part of the plan  Now, for the first time, Ramrod starts to see how he could lead a different way of life. But, for now, he's stuck in his current job. This conflict create's the story's central drama. I won't tell you if the conflict is resolved, or how, but if you see this movie you will have fun, and an interesting time, finding out.  The Town is lean and intense, and at times very violent.But the violence seems fairly real. People who get shot actually bleed and sometimes die. When vehicles crash people actually get hurt. The acting is first rate. The movie looks like, feels like and sounds like Boston (my favorite cold weather American city). In fact, it all seems real, quite an achievement given that the love story aspect is improbable.   If you like lean, intense crime thrillers with a love story on the side, this movie is for you. If you don't, well, see it anyway. It's that good.
B004X60QE2|5.0|awesome think every body should watch this series. it scientific and funny all at the same time. you'll get sucked in like i did
B004ZH65TE|5.0|Stellar performances by a brilliant pianist backed up by a great orchestra.  The beautiful Bach piano concertos, too often ignored, assume a new life in this recording.
B0052WSX32|4.0|Like a lot of Doris Day fans I thought this was going to be a new out of retirement album by Doris, but it wasen't. Actually I know Doris Day has not actually quit working, what with her pet foundation and her Inn that she runs with another business man. But she did quit the show business part of her life. Maybe it's better to quit show business while your still on top. But I still had hoped Doris might go back in the recording studio and do one more take for us devoted Doris Day fans. So she may not sound as good as she did 30 years ago. So what!  Neather did Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland or Rosemary Clooney, but they were great stars and singers. How about that great Tony Bennett at 85 years old still singing his heart out. Tony Bennett and Doris Day were top singing recording artist for Columbia Records in the 50's & 60's. I wish Tony would encourage Doris to go back in the studio and record with him. Anyway this was is a great album and I also loved her son's Terry singing of \\"Happy Endings\\". Buy this album.  Bob \\"Ziggy\\" Anderson<br />  A fan can email me at  robert.anderson110@comcast.net
0525423281|5.0|Since the day I finished Anna and the French Kiss I have been waiting for another Stephanie Perkins masterpiece. She delivered it with Lola and the Boy Next Door. Now that I have finished this one, it will be a very long wait until Isla and the Happily Ever After! I don't think my love for Lola and the Boy Next Door quite lived up to Perkins's debut, but it comes pretty darn close.<br /><br />Lola as a character was a lot of fun, but it bothered me a bit at times that I felt like she was playing the classic \\"mean girl\\" role from time to time. I sat there just thinking, Lola what are you doing? Cricket was oh so perfect, I still am sitting here debating whether I liked him or St Clair better. I loved Lindsey, she is such a great friend.<br /><br />I LOVE that Stephanie Perkins had Anna and St. Clair come back in this one, while they were a more minor part of the plot I loved having them there. I just admire both their personalities so much, so it was so much fun to have them alongside Lola and Cricket!<br /><br />The plot was a ton of fun. I loved that is wasn't just a straight plot, there were so many little things going on, such as with Norah and other characters. I loved that it was so obvious where the story would end, but there were so many stops along the way.<br /><br />Something I love about Perkins's writing is that she doesn't give readers the obvious. With Anna and French Kiss, the plot is at this boarding school in Paris. Lola and the Boy Next Door gives you this story with a girl who dresses in costume, figure skating, and more. Yet, even though all of that is basically unknown to me, I find it so easy to connect to the stories of the characters because she makes her characters so real. They are flawed, which makes them like everyone else.<br /><br />After finishing Lola and the Boy Next Door, I feel like I need to go back and read Anna and the French Kiss and this one back to back, and it would make for about the most perfect day of awesome ever! Lola and the Boy Next Door is one of those books you NEED to read, its story will captivate you and the characters are just so lovely.D to read, its story will captivate you and the characters are just so lovely.
0525425578|2.0|This is not one of John Grisham's best works. It would be better as a part of a collection of short stories. Disappointed but not overly so.
030788743X|5.0|Since Neal Stephenson is no longer interested in writing decent sci-fi (I haven't read Reamde yet), this book fits the bill quite nicely.  An excellent homage to 80's team up movies (think Lost Boys and Goonies), except set in a dystopian future where everyone is jacked in 24-7-365 playing in an online MMORP that is better than real life.  The 80's video game/RPG/music/book/movie/TV show references per page is off the chart.  The perfect gift for the Gen-X nerd on your Christmas list...if they haven't bought it already...
1439183392|5.0|Even if this mystery didn't have a complex plot with lots of twists and turns and double-dealing, and even if it wasn't well written with terrific description, I would have read it just for the opportunity to hang out again with Boone, Dave the Love God, High Tide, Johnny Banzai, and Hang Twelve, and to wait for those big waves to come rolling in while PI Boone Daniels tackles another tough case.
B0029O0BLS|5.0|This is the first review I've written, because I prefer to keep my opinions to myself in general. However, this film (and specifically the BluRay transfer) is excellent. I've always been a fan of the story, but I forgot how well executed the movie was until I saw it again on BluRay. Excellent video transfer and great sound mixdown really highlight how well-made it is. This is one of a handful of disks I use to show off my home theater setup; and for less than 10 bucks, there's really no reason not to have it in your collection.
B000WTZ784|4.0|The versions with normal CD and DVD with digital sound and some videos are very good. The album surprised me and has good songs that make the amazing drive. Who loves Genesis, must know it.
B0054JELS4|5.0|I missed some of the seasons due to not being able to get the channel that it came on, so there was alot that I missed, so when I saw that all 8 seasons were available, I knew that I just had to get it. Am so glad that I did, this has been one of my all time favorite shows since it came on the air. I just really hope that they don't ever cancel it---that would be a big mistake for cbs. It seems like they like to take their good shows & just ruin them.     I hope that this shows keeps going on for a long time. I love Gibbs, Abby, Ziva, Tony, Tim & the rest of the gang. The characters all give their best each & every episode. I think that the producers have picked the right people to play the right parts. Its a fantastic cast.   I will be able to enjoy all seasons for a very long time. They will get watched & watched often. If you havent gotten this collection of series then you really should get it. :-)
B00005YUAC|5.0|The band's first album in remastered and with bonus. Worth it! The band had a very good start with a hard consistent and beautiful songs. \\"Never Let Go\\" is worth the drive.
0142429104|5.0|This is a must read. Especially for the mothers who like Amy, have  the formular for success.  But, continue to go unsung.  Amy Chua embody every struggling mothers need to reach perfection.  As I listened intentently to Chua's story, I secretly  cheered her on wishing her victory. Her drive and persistance   brings her so close to accomplishing her ultimate goal.  I was amazed by how  (this lone tiger) she- managed to advance under pressure.   Being so much like Amy Chua, I wished the story had ended  differently.   Amy Chua states, that this is a story \\"about a bitter clash of cultures, a  fleeting taste of glory and how I [she] was humbled by a  thirteen year old.  I beg to differ.  This is \\"really story of a mother   who wants the best for her children.  Had Lu Lu submit to Amy's wishes this story  could have been about girls who thrive and the mothers who make ultimate  sacrifices.  The unsung heroic mothers who only want the best for their  children.  Amy Chua is a mother who could have done with a little support from her husband, friends,  family and children.  A mother who makes ultimate sacrifices (popular and unpopular sacrifices)  for her children.  A mother who refuses to allow her children to settle for   mediocre or to fail.  A mother who demand perfection from her children.  A mother who (regardless  of this ending) would never have gotten the recognition she so well deserved. This is a story about unsung heroism.
B00408MS5S|5.0|It is a wonderful edition of the CD \\"Breakfast in America\\" with disc 2 live and wonderful songs. Who likes Supertramp, can not lose.
B001TH16DI|1.0|I ordered this set because I love the Star Trek movies.  The set arrived and we placed the first movie (Star Trek The Motion Picture) into the Blu Ray player and it would not play.  We arranged a return and replacement.  Wouldn't you know it, but the very same disc is having the same problems.<br /><br />This is really aggravating.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have to admit this cd has been in heavy rotation on my Ipod since it's release in May. \\"For What it's Worth\\", 'New Orleans\\", \\"Moonlight\\" and title tracks \\"In your Dreams\\" are all worthy of being held up against Nicks best works of the past. Sounding great both on cd and Live (got to see the tour last month) SO very pleased Nicks gave in and made a new music cd.
B005ELZKWS|4.0|Chickenfoot's second album, III, continues what this band is about: making some great rock music. No genre-defining or trying to top the heap, this band and album are great fun, but unlike the debut album, some of this album overtones come off somewhat more darker-themed. Not to say the whole album is like this, there's plenty of Sammy's styled lyrics all over the place, depending on what you're looking for in this album or band is just fun or almost embarrassing. Like the first album, III starts with a great rocker in Last Temptation, lyrics dealing with somewhat religious feel. Another highlight, Different Devil is a great sounding Hagar-styled ballad, if you appreciate Hagar's previous work in this vein you'll sure to love this song. Other album highlights are Up Next, Come Closer, Three and a Half Letters, which contains some very appropriate, for the common man lyrics for what's going on right now, the first single Big Foot, & Dubai Blues. There's a hidden track at the end, which has some very intereting lyrics, somewhat powerful in the statement. The music itself it pretty great, Sammy sounds great for his age, Michael can still throw down some nice bass work with Chad laying down some nice beats. And of course, the great Joe Satriani on the axe, but to be honest, you'd never know it, especially on this album. There are some great guitar parts, but sounds almost as if he's not putting in his signature sound into Chickenfoot. But, I guess you could say that's the point of a supergroup is to sound different from yourself and other bands. For this rock supergroup, Chickenfoot shows that these veterans of rock can still produce great rock music in reflecting modern times.
0385344325|5.0|The novel is a prequel to the other Jack Reacher novels, stepping back in time to his last assignment as a major in the Army's Military Police and, in a sense, setting the stage for the first novel in the series about his civilian life following the Army.  Management books note that companies, agencies, military units, etc., have both formal organizations and informal organizations.  The formal organization defines where you are in the chain of command and pays your salary.  The informal organization gets the work done, sometimes calling in favors, and sometimes using expedient solutions that aren't in the manuals.  In the case of Jack Reacher, he is formally a major in the Military Police assigned to investigations - informally, well, he gets the job done, and some things don't go into official reports.<br /><br />Reacher is sent to a small Mississippi town near a military base to act undercover in an investigation of a woman's death.  I grew up in a small town next to a military base and it brings back some memories.  The case has some unusual twists, especially when he discovers the sheriff (an attractive female) ia a former Marine Corps warrant officer who had been assigned to criminal investigations - she knows the drill.  Part of the problem is determining who is working with him and who is working against him.  There are things that some people are trying to cover up.  He does have his own network of resources.<br /><br />Reacher has some skills dating back to when he was an Army brat, and the skills have been honed by specialized training.  You are ill advised if you challenge him to a fight - and don't expect him to wait until you throw the first punch.  Only six of you?  That's hardly a fight.  He may try to leave you alive, but you can't always count on that.  At best he may leave you embarrassed - at worst he may leave you in the hospital or on a slab.<br /><br />This is a well written novel giving a different look at the main character.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|This is a quick, fun read. Well-written story about the lives of several native San Franciscans living their lives out from childhood to adulthood. From the musically passionate to the aimless drug users, the characters in the novel tell a story of just what happened to those punk rockers you grew up with, after they became adults. I recommend reading this!
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I heard two of Fleet Foxes' songs on the radio, and was entranced. I put this album on my Amazon wish list, and someone generously ordered it for me as a present to welcome me to my new home.  After listening to this album a few times, I'm adding more of their albums to my wish list! There's only one track on this album that gets a little too odd for me at one point, but that's only for a brief part of one song.  The rest is, well, just as the artists describe it: clearly influenced by rock and folk rock from the 60's and 70's, with a dreamlike quality and a dash of contemporary flavor.  If you like those characteristics, you'll like this album. I love it!
055357342X|5.0|Storm of Swords is the third book in the Game of Thrones series. Do not read this without reading the first two books. If you read those two, than you know what to expect... which is mostly the unexpected.  It is another book full of action, intrigue, conspiracies, deceit, and lots of violence. Since this is the third book in the series, I thought I was finally starting to figure out how the storylines were going. I was wrong.
B0052GACNM|1.0|Very sad with this recording.  Tony waaay too loud singing over co-artists' voices and the beginning has VERY confusing advertising that takes you out of downloading (if you can even do it) and does not allow straight playing of the CD.  I LOVED the Bennett with KD Lang, but this one is pathetic.  Don't waste your $ on it.  Sorry Tony.  A loyal fan.
B004YCKK46|5.0|Sleepers is without a doubt, one of the best films I have EVER seen.  I must warn you though that it may change your feelings about Kevin Bacon.  Just remember that Mr. Bacon is playing a ROLE and that is NOT the MAN behind the ROLE!  Robert DeNiro plays a priest, and his protrayal of this man makes you wish that Mr. DeNiro was your REAL father.  Brad Pitt adds his characteristic charisma that has made him a superstar in his role (sorry but I am NOT gonna tell ya, you need to watch the movie).  Dustin Hoffman shows us once again how versatile he is in his role as Snyder, the alcoholic lawyer who is \\"recruited\\" to assist in a story about innocence lost, and revenge...Watch how life is lived and learned...Hell's Kitchen style!  A MUST HAVE...A MUST WATCH...A MASTERPIECE!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game is loads of fun, with an engaging storyline, good controls, and good 2-d graphics.  I got this for free but would have gladly paid the $3 price had I known it was this enjoyable.
B00466HN86|5.0|I saw this movie last night and the writers, directors and actors did an awesome job bringing it to life. With use of tender humor, touching despair, and manly man heroics it charges men to be or become the the spiritual head of their households God created them to be. By incorporating statistics and personal testimony of one of the lead characters, it brings home the fact that children in homes without fathers are more likely to end up on the wrong side of the law. This movie encourages and dares men to come back to the land of accountability, to do the uneasy, difficult and righteous thing--to stay and stand against all odds to be the fathers that their children need them to be.  Fathers who find their M.O. in the Bible, fathers who build a foundation and set a standard to which their children may aspire. Being an okay dad...is no longer acceptable. Memorable character to look out for is \\"Javier\\" I LOVED him!<br /><br />After the movie was over, there were men at the exits handing out flyers for the Courageous Men Bible Study program instituted by the men in the movie. All in all a well spent night for me...and you too, if you purchase.
B001EJGJ5G|5.0|Jamie Lee Curtis is beautiful and you understand why she is beautiful even today.  John Travolta is emotional, pouty, sexy and take me back to the 70's when there was a 24-hr fitness channel.  Would love to see John in more heart pieces.  Jamie - simply awesome.  Bright, funny, beautiful and so talented.  Really both should be in more movies.
B0050PYNN0|4.0|Well lucky for me i got both the unrated and rated versions of this movie. It was a mixture of comedy , action and at times crude smut. However overall i enjoyed this movie and had a few good laughs with my friends.
B004J2TPSI|5.0|I purchased a set of bluetooth headset (Rocketfish) for my Sony MP3. I was burned years ago buy Apple & refuse to buy their products so I do work arounds. This is a great alternate if you're traveling & do not want to deal with wires & do not care about top sound quality.   You will have to sync up the transmitter & headset each time. Also battery life seems around 3 hours, distance between transmitter & headset before signal loss is 30'.
B005974CNA|5.0|I have been a Dream Theater fan since I first heard \\"Images and Words\\" over 25 years ago. I have seen them live twice (which is no small feat when you live in the Florida panhandle) and will be seeing them again in two weeks. At first, I was dismayed to hear about Mike Portnoy leaving the group. But, as with the arrival of Jordan Rudess and the release of \\"SFAM\\"[[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]], the infusion of a new influence (Mike Mangini) has re-energized the group! This is their best album since \\"SFAM\\". Cant wait to see them in Atlanta
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Quick review   BUY it! In my opinion this is the best Child novel so far and I've read all 16 of them.  Quick, crisp sentence structure punctuated with descriptives that put you right next to the situation Reacher's found himself in.  Again... read it, you'll love it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|10/13/11  Upgrading from 3 to 4 stars. Game has not reset since my original review. Still annoyed by popups, but have finished the game, and found it to be well worth having!  Game itself is great!  Love the challenges and love the music, though 2-3 more similarly peaceful and soothing tunes would be welcome.  The two (or three? not sure) tunes it has now are too few.  However, must dock two stars.  One for annoying popups, asking for a rating and to \\"like\\" on Facebook, the latter of which I'm just not ever going to do.  Second deduction is because the game spontaneously resets, causing me to lose all progress and have to start all over.  :/  HTC EVO 4G
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Pretty poor graphics, highly blurry and pixelated.  Unfortunately, it's a really poor port from their iOS version.  Hoping for an update to put this on par with every other version of the game released.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book!  Memories of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Marley and Me, Tuesdays with Morrie, all waifted through the soulful quiet words of Enzo, and bring them full voice in the end.   Be sure to share the young version &#34;The Art of Racing in the Rain&#34; with your children. I cant wait to see the upcoming movie.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|Ok, so I don't scare easily at all. Even my tough guy friends scare easier than I do. I've been waiting for a movie that would scare me so much, that everytime I thought of it, I'd have trouble sleeping. I've seen so many scary movies, most of them being R (cause most \\"scary\\" PG-13 movies aren't scary, this movie being the exception). I wanted to cry at some parts of the movie, but I didn't since I don't cry easy either. Everytime I think of this movie when I'm going to bed, I get so scared. All of my friends, guys and girls, who had seen this, were so scared from it too, and have trouble sleeping from it, too.<br /><br />So, if you love being scared like I do, this is a must see/get movie. If you get scared easily, beware because it may scar you for life.<br /><br />I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!<br /><br />Spoiler alert.... kinda.... not really though...<br /><br />The ending is the scariest part, so if you do watch this, but want to look away at the scary parts (like some of my friends do) look away at the end.
0307586901|2.0|This craft book has 255 projects to make for various holidays throughout the year.  Many of the `crafts' involve ideas such as putting cellophane and candy in clear plastic balls and placing them in a large glass bowl, or putting dollies on top of wrapped packages for  decoration.<br />There are some good ideas; for example how to cover a balloon with glitter, making the popular love knot bracelets (although the bracelets shown are not the thick ones many prefer), felt fortune cookies and many egg dying tips. Sometimes the directions, quite frankly, are awful - almost no directions at all, for instance on how to make a birch basket. One project says use wheat paste, but neglects to tell how to make it or if you should purchase it.  Another tells you to download and print spider web templates-where? - There is no recommendation within the project directions itself.<br />Silhouette templates for windows that appear to be 3-4 feet high are less than ½ inch large? This book just does not lend much of a helping hand most of the time. An illuminated trick or treat bag, which is a fabulous idea, gives no illustration at all with the very short directions on how to accomplish this task. The so called templates for all the crafts are at most 1\\" high.<br /><br />The holidays covered are; New Year's, Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's day, Father's day, Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas. There is an index and a section on basic techniques - cutting with a craft knife, using a pom-pom maker, embroidery stiches, etc. A source guide with phone numbers, web sites and some addresses and a buyer's guide are also included.<br /><br />If you are a beginning crafter, you really need more help than this book will give you. Even experienced crafters might rub their head and eyes in exasperation.

B005OT2YVA|5.0|As a long time fan of the Transformers (i watched the cartoon faithfully as a kid), i have enjoyed every single movie so far; and this one definitely does NOT disappoint!  Transformers: Dark of the Moon, which i watched via Amazon's Instant Video, is action packed (i was tense the entire time i watched the movie and laughed out loud at the humorous moments and even cheered when the Autobots kicked Decepticon butt), includes many of the same actors (which i was glad to see), and was interesting how they used some of actual history to create this movie and really make it work.  Excellent, excellent movie!!

B0010SKTRA|4.0|Shubin creates an easily read narrative about his own history in archeology while building a solid exposition relating archeological progress, evolutionary development, structural and functional relationships across species and tying it all together to explain why most animals on the planet are so similar in so many ways!  I found it technically sound and informative without being pedantic. It also compiled several issues in very accessible terms that I've had to find for myself across several books of far less enjoyable reading.  A very good book to get an overview of a lot of evolutionary information for those who may not want to slog through detailed descriptions of dig sites and archeological journal articles.
B005EXA8LY|5.0|Just received the Special Edition. This is indeed Steven Wilson's most ambitious project, and that is saying something! The melodic threads of this soundscape, weave their way into a rich musical tapestry, that begs for further explorations. The metal is indeed gone for the most part, however, it has been replaced by majesty. Still heavy in sections, but delivered with acoustic guitars, jazz saxophone, and strings, as well as Steve's trusty PRS guitar. As well as others, who have commented on echoes of King Crimson's sound creeping in, I also hear the symphonic feel of E.L.O. in the mix. The sound is phenomenal, the 6.1 surround is utilized brilliantly! The booklet is, at first glance, yet another exercise in artsy-fartsy self-indulgence, upon further examination, the booklet achieves an artistic cohesiveness that other Lasse Hoile/PT/Steven Wilson collaborations have only hinted at. I too, really enjoy the songs \\"Deform to Form a Star\\", \\"Sectarian\\" and \\"Postcard\\". All in all, a towering achievement from the prolific master! We truly are not worthy to be the recipients of this man's genius. Drink it in, in fact \\"Drown\\" in it!

B0058ZPMYG|5.0|This movie Is a real gem and you will find yourself curious the first 20 minutes, then your hooked on these zanny characters. Natalie Portman Is good as a cashier at a grocery store. And at befriending little TJ.  But by the end It will have you laughing and crying at the same time.  Each twist Is something different than the usual twists In a movie like this. I do not want to give anything away. But what ever age this movie will move you at the least.  And Hesher Is great!

0756404738|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I ever read. This is a very large book, more than 900 pages but once I started reading it I couldn't stop. Moreover, I found my self thinking on the story even when I wasn't reading it.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I would really rate this 4 stars, but I'm so bewildered by the avg scoring that I'm trying to boost it up a little.  Stylized, well paced, and a good balance between action, comedy and thriller.

030745455X|4.0|So, despite reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo twice, I still had no desire to pick up these last two books of the Millennium trilogy.  There they sat, on my TBR list, woefully looking at me and wondering just what they'd done wrong - when what they'd done wrong was nothing they'd actually done int he first place, it was their dratted older sister, that Dragon Tattoo book.<br /><br />You see, I was insanely bored.. TWICE (once for pleasure, once for book club) through the first half of Dragon Tattoo.  I'm just not all that interested in Swedith politics, business or.. well anything outside of just every day human stories, and IKEA of course.  Mikael has a kind of milque-toast personality to me, yes, I know he's all gung-ho about exposing things but he's just so.. bland.  So the book really came alive for me with Lisbeth Salander, who ended up redeeming the whole thing.<br /><br />The Girl who Played with Fire was better - much better, but still.. long portions smack dab in the middle that just seemed to drag the story on endlessly.  This book was so incredibly long, it was frustrating me, frustrating me to read the fumbling of the police and to sit through all of the work and shuffling Larsson had to do to get everyone's thought processes to sync.  And don't even get me started on yet another cliffhanger - so glad I waited to read this one.<br /><br />Is The Girl who Played with Fire better than Dragon Tattoo?  Yes.  Definitely.  However there were still things about it that irked me, it's length being one of the major ones.  And I'm still not sure what exactly Salander's actions on Grenada had to do with anything - that part of the story seemed really out of sync.  Oh well though!<br /><br />Now I'm bound to read The Girl who Kicked a Hornet's Nest because after the cliffhanger here, there really was no doubt about it!
B001UHOWW4|5.0|The blu-ray 50th anniversary release of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" occurred on September 20, 2011.  All reviews posted earlier than that date refer to earlier DVD releases and will confuse those seeking information on this new blu-ray edition.  I am happy to report that the blu-ray edition (based on a complete 2011 restoration of the film) is amazing and is the one to have in your film library.  The image detail is so clear and clean!  The audio is outstanding in its clarity!  The special features appear to be the same ones from the Centennial Collection DVD edition.
030726999X|4.0|I'm a confused legal reader.  I do love a good legal battle, but I am so over the John Grisham-type novels.  As a result, I think I found that I enjoyed The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest the most out of all three books of the millennium trilogy.<br /><br />I found the pacing, the information, the legal battle, the revenge - everything to be perfectly plotted and laid out and I loved every single moment of it.  I was reading this book on the sofa in my college's library, while sitting in my car waiting on a family member, at the table while eating various meals and finally finished it up at 2am on the same day I was to be starting college - not fun when you have an 8am class!<br /><br />I love it when I get a sense of vindication, when I want to pump my fist and do a victory dance and that definitely happened with this finale.  Is it worth reading through the hundreds of pages leading up to it?  I'm still uncertain of that, days later - because, let's face it, there are some really incredibly boring parts in this trilogy.  Still, I feel as if I got something out of the investment and finally understand where all the hype is coming from.
1250004349|4.0|saw the movie first. Enjoyed it very much. But almost everyone I speak to said \\"the book is better\\" - so got it on Amazon. Actually haven't had a chance to read it yet - but very much looking forward to it.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|I will admit right now, I didn't finish this book. I got too annoyed by having to sift through the details of his novels in order to find info on what he did.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|great game in the same right as all the early rpgs were.  characters have depth and honesty.  humor and drama all wrapped in a nice graphical package.  worth the money.
1439156816|5.0|I have never read a book by Stephen King before this one.  I have no affinity for the horror genre and really had no idea what Stephen King was like as a writer or a person. I picked this book up because I am a former English teacher and I do some writing. I like advice and am always curious about different writers' approach to their craft. I discovered that (surprise, surprise) Stephen King is an extraordinary writer, thoroughly engaging, honest, bright, and down to earth. His approach to the art of writing is strict (know grammar, avoid adverbs and passive voice) and mystical (stories are fossils buried in the ground and it is the job of the writer to unearth them). He is generous and specific in his directions on how to accomplish this miracle.<br />Some reviewers have complained (a bit) about the first part of the book which is autobiographical. I loved this part and I don't think the book would have been complete without it. We get a look at the elements of Stephen's background which prepared him for his ambitious work ethic and success. He tells the story of his hardscrabble childhood with humor and love. He was never pampered or coddled, but he had a supportive mother and some high school teachers who nurtured his ability. He gives credit to those people and when he loves he loves big. When someone doesn't appreciate him, he doesn't let it get to him.<br />This is a great handbook for teachers of writing. While teachers' colleges, at least in New England, are advising teachers NOT to teach grammar, Stephen King recognizes the tools of the writers' toolbox, vocabulary and grammar. He's a big advocate of Strunk and White and gives practical advice to writers (and readers). He believes, and makes the reader believe, that it is possible to turn a competent writer into a good writer. And he is so entertaining that students would love to read him.<br />I rarely listen to books on tape because I often don't like the voice or delivery of the reader. Stephen King is the reader of this book and I found his voice to be the perfect accompaniment to this wonderful book. I found myself looking forward to getting back in the car to hear the next disc and played some discs twice. I'm even thinking of delving into one of his scary books now.this book and I found his voice to be the perfect accompaniment to this wonderful book.

0385344325|5.0|Always wanted to title a review with that, don't know what it means.  except I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this Reacher novel was.  Lately the books have seemed too formulaic, and not up to the standards Child set for himself early in the series.  This book fixes that, and is a very good read.  I actually want to start over with the Killing Floor after reading this one.  If you like Reacher the way he was, then this is the book for you.  It would even be a good starter book for anyone who hasn't picked up one of the earlier books.  Congratulations Lee Child on a very good book.
1597772992|5.0|I think that this is the kind of information that everyone consuming a western diet needs to know so that they can make an educated decision about what they put into their bodies.  The recording is excellent and the book itself is written very well and easy for anyone to understand.  You don't have to be a scientist to understand it either. With audio you can rewind and relisten when ever you need to!!! So worth the cost!!!

Abby & Travis are hilarious and it makes it a very funny and entertaining book. I have to admit that I laughed out loud a couple of times because of the funny fights and arguments they had. It's a fun & easy read. Trust me, you will not regret reading this book. =)

B0034G4OY0|5.0|\\"Hereafter\\" is an amazing movie. I can't understand why it's generated such mixed reviews. The only thing I can think of is that the film was a lot different than I thought it would be based on the movie trailer, which made it out to be a scary thriller. It's not that at all. The movie revolves around three people living in three different countries who all are affected by death in some way. One man is a medium of sorts and has the ability to communicate with the dead. A woman survives a near-death experience that changes her life. And a young boy is lost after the death of his brother and is desperately searching for answers and reassurances.<br /><br />I thought the movie was great. It tackled this sensitive subject matter from multiple perspectives and was incredibly moving at times (I teared up during some of the Marcus/Jason scenes). Clint Eastwood is amazing, and \\"Hereafter\\" is just one more of his brilliant films.
B0053Q9DQI|1.0|MOVIE GREAT!  so far bought and returned 2 blu-ray dvds of this movie and neither of them play. if the 3rd does not play, i'll keep my regular copy. heard blu-ray problems on other brand new releases of some movies, don't know the problem. my player is only 2 years old, not hooked up to the internet.
B003PAXONC|5.0|This I Am Legend combo is worth the purchase.  Not only do you get it in Blu-ray but you also get the version with the great alternate ending.  Personally, while I enjoyed the cinematic release (and have never walked the nighttime streets of a downtown without thinking of the movie), I found the story line of the orginial cinema release as lacking.  These concerns were at the same time confirmed and resolved by watching the version with the alternate ending.  I won't go into details, however, if you watch the alternate ending, you will notice that it not only changes how the movie ends but some of the central themes addressed by the movie (God, humanity and the ethics/possibility of a cure).  Enjoy.

0307408833|5.0|Tried the banana bread last weekend for my egg, soy, gluten, and milk allergic toddler.  There is a great suggestion to use up extra batter by spreading a thin layer on a cookie sheet and using it like bread.  That's what I did for my little guy.  Dad and I ate the loaf, and he munched on the skinny bread at snack times for several days.  The only drawback here is that a lot of the recipes I was interested in called for spelt, which doesn't work for us.  I've still found plenty to drool over in this book, tho!
B00479SVBU|4.0|Completely satisfied with the product.  The only reasons for not giving it 5stars is the display is difficult to read in the daylight, and that may just be where to power outlet is in my Jeep.  and it is so tight in the socket that it is hard to remove but that could be due to my vehicle also.  It was easy to set up, only took a few minutes.  I would not hesitate to recomend this to anyone & in fact, I already have.    The unit was at my door 2 days before it was promised.

0307887898|4.0|This book caught my attention because I am joining a startup in the near future. While I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of his methods first-hand, the examples and principles gave me a lot to think about.<br /><br />I think the principle of continuous testing *with* your customers is perhaps the most important thing I gained from reading. This is certainly something I will be interested in implementing in the future. With any luck, I'll get more out of reading the book as my experience grows working in a startup environment.<br /><br />I'm all for gaining from others' experiences and applying the lessons in my own situation. Ries's perspective is worth checking out. At the very least, you'll come away with some new ideas. Sometimes that is all you need to make a difference.
B00008OE4W|5.0|I saw this film years ago and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The film is about a bunch of guys who in their own right have special and unique skills. The heros are conned by a couple of devilish characters who want then to retrieve a device. When the group discovers what the device can do and what it will be used for their lives are turned upside down. The police, FBI and other law enforcement agencies are hunting them down. In the end the team recovers the device and must make a deal with the CIA to regain control of their lives. The film is EXCELLENT, no CGI, no computer graphics just good solid acting by everyone. Worth watching over and over again. SOLID MARKS!!

B004H0N4PC|5.0|Build a Rocket Boys is more understated than their previous release, The Seldom Seen Kid, but the scaled down songs seem to carry more emotional punch.  Guy Garvey's voice is one of the real gems in today's musical landscape and his lyrics read like a well written book.  The backing music, stripped down on this release, still has the beautiful and unique orchestrations of their past efforts that blend absolutely perfectly with Garvey's voice.  This is one of those CDs that grabs you and pulls you in with each successive listen.  It's hard to pick out a standout track because they are all so amazing.  Neat Little Rows and Open Arms are probably the two tracks that soar the most and remind you of the vibe from songs that made The Seldom Seen Kid a huge success.  Less grandiose songs like Lippy Kids and the absolutely heart wrenching The Night Will Always Win are what really set the emotional tone for this album.  It is surprising that Elbow's huge success in England has not translated more here in the States because these guys are absolutely superb.  I just saw them in concert and their live performance is simply stunning.

The remastered CD is over-compressed to the point where there's clipping all over the place.   Dave Grohl's drums sound flat and lifeless now. It's a shame that such a legendary album   gets such a terrible treatment.   Google \\"Loudness War\\" to find out more about the technical details.
B003JLA4KS|4.0|After watching this show on VH1 I thought it would be good for my collection. My order came faster than expected. It came in perfect condition.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Each season of Breaking Bad has been better than the last. This third season had me locked in for all thirteen episodes and features several great storylines, my favorite being Hank's. These characters have developed so much since season 1 and I can't wait to see where they go in season 4.   If you haven't started watching Breaking Bad yet, do it now.
B003NRYJLS|3.0|My wife and I got hooked on Breaking Bad a couple months back and have now downloaded and watched all the episodes from the first three seasons.  Since several episodes are fresh in our minds we both noticed that \\"Fly\\" stood out as a time filler.  The episode only features Walter and Jesse and centers around Walt's obsession with killing a fly in his lab that he considers to be \\"contamination\\".  I'm sure there are all sorts of deeper levels of meaning that some people may appreciate, but for us, it was just filler.
B005ARYDYC|5.0|SO excited that  this movie  came out on blu ray!!  This classic movie  looks amazing in HD!!!  Get it!! Get it!!!
0316056863|3.0|I stumbled across this book and because it was recommended to me a number of times, I said Why Not just read it ?<br /><br />I have to confess, I don't watch 30 Rock nor SNL and therefore I don't know who Tina Fey is or anything about her accomplishments. Well, However after reading her book I'll tell you this she is a very funny person. I found myself laughing out loud just reading this memoir ! Her sense of humor is awesome. She looks so fun to be around.<br /><br />Her writing style is a just a *little* choppy at times but is never boring. I still don't know what this book is all about since it doesn't seem to be revolving around a certain subject but instead around Tina's life from childhood till now in general terms.<br /><br />Well, personal memoirs are not usually my cup of tea but this was pretty amusing.
B001MSMULG|3.0|This book was a good read. It took a while for me to get into because of background of Gabriel. The beginning seemed to be a tad confusing. It picked up the pace once Ari comes into the picture. I never suspected the ending and it was a real twist to me. I hope the next book is a bit quicker of a pace than this one.
B005LAZIRY|3.0|I honestly need to swallow my pride, and change this review. I will leave the original comments below to be responsible. Though I still do not believe this is on par with the better Opeth releases (Damnation, Blackwater Park, Watershed, and Ghost Reveries), it is far better than I first assessed. Having seen them 3 times during the Heritage tour, I really respect the level of quality, musicianship, and professionalism they put out. So, after all of this time, I must re-assess Heritage and fairly rate it 3 Stars. All I can say is that I was anticipating a huge release, and they put out a very different release with a very new direction that I didn't expect. It's pretty good, not great though. Last thought, the overall album is even better with the added bonus tracks Pyre and Face In The Snow. I am really looking forward to the next release in 2014!<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />This is not Opeth! It's great to try new things and experiment, but I always believed an established band should deliver what got them their fan base. An experimental song or two is totally acceptable, but a whole release dedicated to experimental music is just not realistic (especially while keeping fans waiting for over three years!). Honestly, regardless of what long time Opeth fans may say, Heritage is not great, Heritage does not have good quality sound, Heritage does not have strong song writing, and realistically should have been an Åkerfeldt solo release. Anyone that has cranked the fantastic Ghost Reveries, Blackwater Park, or even Watershed should be honest and surely agree. Sorry, but this is honesty from a fan based in reality...
0062060554|3.0|Interesting book... hold out to the end!  Seemed to be repeating himself but worth the read once you have invested the time.
B000026OW3|5.0|Rubenstein's old recordings have been beautifully remastered and it is as if you were hearing him in person!  The sound is very good and the price is even better!
B004EPZ06G|2.0|Like the other reviewers I've watched the first movie and loved it. So, when I heard they are making a sequel I was really excited ! However, this movie was a let down.<br /><br />It's basically the same plot recycled all over again but instead of taking Place in Las Vegas which really gives you the sense of a Bachelor's Party gone bad this one takes place in Bangkok, Thailand. The same characters are attending a wedding and the same guy goes missing ....Oh that sounds familiar ! It's the same story all over again except less funny. Yes, movies like the Hangover will never win an Oscar but that's not why they are made ! They are for pure entertainment they're supposed to be dumb and funny. This movie not only wasn't it fun but it wasn't even funny. I think I laughed ...Hmm Maybe Once.<br /><br />As for the setting, I usually have this unexplained fascination with places I've never visited before and I've visited both Las Vegas and Bangkok and still loved the first movie. However, Bangkok as the whereabouts for Hangover II isn't exactly the best place suitable. No offense it's a beautiful country but it's not right.<br /><br />I can say I loved this movie but I'm trying to give an honest review. Obviously I'm in the minority here so there's a chance you'll like it. I can't recommend it to anyone though. The first movie was a classic and I recommend you re-watch it again. This one however is a pointless sequel with no original plot.<br /><br />-Major disappointment ! Rent before you buy.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|This watch was a gift - obviously the givers read the reviews here and thought this watch would be an excellent addition to my running lifestyle. After fighting with the watch  for two months, I'm finally ready to give up on it. The programs are great in theory, but in practice the bevel NEVER works with just one try. And when you are about to take off on a run the last thing you want to do is fight with the bevel to get you to the proper screens. Nothing is simple or turnkey about use of this watch - from setting it up, to use and even the wireless transfer of information using the ANT agent takes longer than it seems like it should.  I know Garmin generally makes great products - I've run with their heart rate monitor/watch combos before. But this watch is incredibly frustrating and not something i would recommend, unless you're the kind of person who just loves tinkering with gadgets and gizmos....if that is the case you should definitely get this watch because it will provide a lifetime of trying to figure out what the heck has gone wrong this time.
030788743X|5.0|A great combination of story plot and tight writing.  An additional plus for me was to \\"re-live\\" the days of the first easter eggs, old video games and systems, big hair bands, etc. Absolutely TONS of 80's references that made me wax nostalgic and annoy my wife with stories of \\"the old days\\".  Cline also runs an excellent cautionary subtext of what might happen if society moves to valuing electronic interactions over physical, but doesn't get preachy about it.  I also enjoyed the (possibly imagined!) parallels betwwen IOI and what Microsoft might finally turn into.  I've not read Cline before but can't wait for his next effort!
B001KL3GZO|5.0|Let's see. You have Miles Davis at the height of cool, all-star musicians sitting in, great sound, great songs, and bonus material if you're interested.  If, like me, you ever played a trumpet or cornet, you need to hear this album.  It's how I wish I could have played.  And the price is great, too!  So go get this one; you will not be disappointed!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished reading the trilogy and this book, along with the other 2, is the best that I have read in a LONG time.  I bought this book for my 12-year old daughter and decided to read it, too.  I was immediately immersed in the story and could not wait to read the others.  We both read along at different paces, but loved to talk about what happened every day and share our thoughts on the story together.  This story was written so well that the characters felt real to me and I was sad to see it end.
B005OP71GC|5.0|ABC's latest drama is loosely based on one of the greatest novels of all time, Le Comte De Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and given a contemporary spin. The pilot episode sets up the entire plot, in a very unique manner: beginning in the present day and told via flashbacks throughout. The acting is stellar and the writing rock solid. The details are juicy and the fun has just begun...
B000PTYPAC|5.0|This is a great CD, not one bad track here, and \\"Misery Business\\" is both funny and powerful.  I love this group's work.  For those of you who are older, like me; I think this group will remind you of Debbie Harry and Blondie.
B004WQ2L9G|4.0|A good set overall and the piano music is all first rate. For the rest, DG with their archive could have done better. The recordings are a bit old, and the lieder, which is much under-rated, is (to my ears anyway) given a very sub-par performance.

B004I2K4DY|4.0|I saw this DVD as a premium on my PBS station, but did not want to contribute a couple of hundred to get it. Very different from the 10th anniversary performance where everyone was on stage, actors came and went through a central passage. Some of the material was changed to incorporate more of the dialogue and this is good. The staging and lighting is dramatic and adds to the experience, and this had to be especially so for those in attendance. Cossette from the 10th anniversary is not Fontaine, but everyone else is new. The voices were good, especially when considering some of the casting decisions were based on current pop popularity. In many ways, I still prefer the 10th anniversary over this one, but probably because I have such a history with it - having watched it countless times, and listened to the CD even more.   There is a 25th anniversary CD - it is NOT the same cast/cutting you will find on the DVD, and while good, the voices do not come across as strong.   Universal is making a movie of Les Mis and produced this DVD. Shame on them!!!!!!!  One-star for packaging. There is the box, the cover and the CD - and nothing else. Not even an insert listing the cast, or order of songs. Nada. This is not a budget-priced DVD and Universal could certainly have covered the cost of a single page insert. For anyone using this as an introduction to the musical or the book, there is nothing here to tell you what is happening.  The encore featured a hundred or so students that had presented the school-version of the musical.  Worth the investment!
B00466H3DG|5.0|This film is a work of art. From start to finish, it is a feast for the eyes as well as the soul.   I feel like it doesn't get enough respect. Easily one of my top ten films of all time.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This group of three has it all.  Great song-writing, superb Bass player, classically, I think, trained keyboard/guitar player and good drummer.  Uprising and Undisclosed Desires especially good, with intricate bass lines.  Uprising was actually done on \\"American Idol\\" quite well actually by James Durban last year.  I had never heard of them before that.  Neal Bennett, lead singer and guitar player called up and challenged Durban to sing the chorus an octave up and he did.  I have played \\"uprising' in public, but can't do the octave thing.  Oh well!
080508990X|5.0|Great easy fun little book that my little one loves to read over and over again!! Teaches them about the colors and different animals.
0395078016|5.0|\\"Mein Kampf\\", My Struggle, was first published in 1925. Eighty-six years ago. It remains just as relevant today, remaining one of the most universally-known books in history. Everyone knows the name of three books- the dictionary, the Holy Bible, and Mein Kampf.<br /><br />I should add, before proceeding further, that this is so far the best version of \\"Mein Kampf\\" I've yet found. Originally translated and published in 1943, my copy was printed in 1975 if I recall right. It has a foreword and some footnotes that probably wouldn't have existed had the Reich won World War II, but what matters most is that the translation is excellent. And at times, the original German is even provided and compared with the way it was translated into English.<br /><br />What makes \\"Mein Kampf\\" so significant is not so much the book by itself- unusual as it is- but rather the man, and the deeds of the man, who wrote it. This book either details outright or strongly implies the plans and intentions of Adolf Hitler. Having read it, was I that surprised that he went on to invade nearly every country in Europe and engage in the genocide of millions of people? No, not really. That's what makes this book so important. Whatever it is or isn't worth as a work of literature, it is the story of one of the most powerful men in history. It's also 715 pages long, so don't expect it to be short.<br /><br />As a work of literature, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is like no other book I've ever read. In fact, there is only one collection of written words that has struck me as being at all similar: the journal of Eric David Harris. Both their writings were, to me, a bit like a burnt cookie- always limited by that hate pulsing within the pages. Nobody paid attention to Adolf Hitler, or Eric Harris, until the opportune moment to stop them had passed. Hitler published his plans in this book for all the world to see, and Harris kept his plans in a journal, right there in his room. My point? Read the writings of people like them, because ignoring them has a long record of being a spectacularly stupid mistake.a long record of being a spectacularly stupid mistake.
B005E7AOHI|4.0|After a long hiatus in which bassist/vocalist Les Claypool released several albums with a variety of collaborators, Primus returns with their new release, Green Naugahyde. Simply put, this is easily the best Primus release since Pork Soda. A previous reviewer indicated this may take a few listens to grow on you and I completely agree. I listened to this five times before I was hooked. While this isn't quite as musically varied as some of their other albums, this may be their most consistent collection of songs as there's not a bad one to be found. Also worth noting is that the band sound more like Frank Zappa than ever as Les's lyrics have become very topical and often scathing. \\"The Last Salmon Man\\" brings back that now majestic march beat of their past and is their best song since \\"My Name Is Mud\\".  \\"Lee Van Cleef\\" and \\"Hoinfodaman\\" are carried by a Les's catchy yet complicated basslines and quirky lyrics. The satire rears its head on the wicked \\"Jilly's On Smack\\", the killer \\"Eyes of the Squirrel\\", \\"Eternal Consumption Engine\\", and \\"Moron TV\\", all excellent tunes.  The Zappa influence continues on \\"Tragedy's A-Comin\\" as Les's verses are spoken in a sinister tone just like Frank did on \\"I'm The Slime\\". Other strong tunes include the proper opener \\"Hennepin Crawler\\" and \\"Extinction Burst\\", probably the only song ever recorded to reference both baseball pitcher Randy Johnson and hot dog eating champion Kobayashi. If you loved Primus before, you'll love them again with Green Naugahyde. Highly recommended.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Oh yes, she does.  She was born to sing this way, her voice is perfectly suited for the blues.  LOVE - LOVE - LOVE IT.
B002G4FQAC|5.0|I highly recommend this CD, as well as their \\"Riot\\" CD.  There are at least three great songs on this CD.  \\"Brick By Boring Brick\\",  \\"Ignorance\\" and \\"Turn It Off\\".  Fast, with a lot of energy, rhythm changes and tongue in cheek lyrics.

B000063DIH|3.0|This band lost it's lead singer and then got him back.  The lead singer on this CD is not the main man, who is the best front man I have ever seen.  The band itself is very talented on all levels musician-wise.  Catch this band live on Palladia TV.  They charge too much for tickets for their show($425).  This band is not one of those \\"Satanic-based\\" heavy metal bands.  They have fun.  Some of the best musicians on this planet are in this band including two of the three guitar players, the bass player(who is the leader) and the drummer.  Add in the front man and this is a superb band.............just not on this CD.

0385534639|5.0|Loved it. For me I felt the 1st few chapters to be a little slow which might be difficult for impatient readers to get through, but overall so rewarding! The mysterious and seductive feel of this novel is absolutely dream-like. This author will certainly have my attention.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Adele has a great voice.  Her songs are passionate, well-written and catchy.  The only negative for me is that within some of the songs they get repetitive.  Need to change it up, more bridges or something else seems to be missing.

B00005LOUP|2.0|I'll say it up-front. Personally, I'm not a fan. If you want true Seuss-y enjoyment, you can get a copy of the original How The Grinch Stole Christmas! (with the exclamation-point) on DVD (with extras) and it includes the almost as great Horton Hears A Who, both of which had the direct-input and approval of Dr. Seuss.<br /><br />Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (and, I'm certain, an uncredited squad of fixers and hacks) added an unnecessary back-story to the Grinch in an attempt to give the miserable SOB \\"motive\\" and to make him, for some reason, more sympathetic. They give him a public-humiliation in grade school, something with which any viewer can relate, but even in that they hedge their bets, making him a vicious little monster as an infant as if they simply can't decide how they want to present his character. Is he naturally cruel, or the creation of his tormenting classmates? Most bewilderingly perhaps is that the Whos, previously so pure and joyful in their observation of Christmas, are turned into petty, greedy, consumption-obsessed nitwits, many with less-than-noble ulterior motives. Carey and Howard pack everything they can into the film in order to make Hollywood Holiday Blockbuster Magic and, in that at least, they succeeded, garnering a worldwide gross at the time of this writing of over $345 million, but where is the joy? The action is frenetic, Carey is manic, the cute and funny dog is cute and funny in all the right places, and the comedy is in turn satirical and slapstick. Somewhere in there, a holiday about love and selflessness gets lost.<br /><br />Art direction, it should be said, was delightful. The sets and costumes, hair and makeup, are all very well-executed eye-candy, and have a definite true Seuss look. They got that much right at least. But then, they had Theodore \\"Dr. Seuss\\" Geisel's wonderful drawings to use as a blueprint. If only they had kept true to the spirit of his story as well.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|This CD showcases Johnny's amazing guitar playing and shows the renewed strength of his voice.  I recently read a blog where the author stated that Johnny's career was over because his playing wasn't as fast as it was thirty years ago.  It's obvious that the author is not a guitar player.  Speed is not the only factor in making a great guitarist.  The tone that he pulls out to the instrument and the subtle melody lines that he plays under his singing are wonderful.  That blogger will probably also be disappointed that Johnny no longer is able to leap over Rick Derringer while playing.  This CD also demonstrates another of Winter's assets: Letting the guests and back up players shine.  Winter has long been known as being generous in sharing the stage with other players.  You can hear the joy in his voice as he sings the songs that influenced him.  If anyone has earned the ability to sing the blues, It's Johnny Winter.  Born Albino, legally blind and crosseyed, he managed to make quite a career for himself.  He has often times been his own worst enemy:Long bouts with drugs, alcohol allowed a former manager to steal from him. It also gained him the reputation of being unreliable. He's had bouts with major depression, broken his hip and managed to survive it all.  He plays over a hundred shows a year and they are mostly sell outs.  When the world ends it will be Johnny Winter and the cockroaches.  I put my money on Winter.

0525423281|5.0|SO cute, this book really bring out the oddest of plots, it's so simple but there are verses in it that will touch your heart. Like Stephanie's last book, I really wish it never ended. It's so realistic too, to the point where I was a little disappointed with the unoriginal happy and subtle ending - I wanted something more!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used a lot of different keyboards including swype, flext9, regular android, and htc keyboard and I have to say that this keyboard is the keyboard of choice at the moment. The prediction algorithm is far better than all of the keyboards that I've tried before. It also comes with a number of great features and customization options. One feature I would like to see in the future is the ability to edit the dictionary manually without having to actually type out the word and delete entries.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|This is a good action packed movie sure to please the science fiction/fantasy enthusiast. The story starts with an alternate history of the moon landing with an alien discovery twist and moves on to become a fast-paced action movie with the familiar heroes except for one, a new romantic interest. The new romantic interest, played by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, fails to measure up to the previous one played by Megan Fox.<br /><br />The sound and video are both first rate and will rattle your rafters if you crank up the sound high enough. The story line holds ones interest and provides enough surprise elements to keep one guessing. This is a worthy addition to the franchise and a keeper for any collector of this genre.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|I really don't think I would buy the blu ray dvd movie, but when I saw it at an IMAC theater in 3-D, it was increadable. That's the only way to see this movie. Without the 3-D effects, it's not that great.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This is the perfect album for any Shania fan who just wants to pop a CD in the car and hear all of her best songs.  I'd also recommend it to anyone who has never really listened to much Shania, who wants to get familiar with her music.  My only real complaint about the album is that I wish they would have put the original country version of \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" on the album, rather than the dance mix.  I also wouldn't have minded if they included \\"Rock This Country!\\" and \\"You've Got A Way\\".  Either way though, this is a great collection of Shania's best songs.

0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins has created a formula for the perfect romance novel. Part of me wonders if she actually has a physical formula written down. Why? Because Lola and the Boy Next Door has so many of the same elements that made Anna and the French Kiss wonderful. The comparisons between Anna and the French Kiss and Lola and the Boy Next Door aren't obvious. You have to carefully break each book down into elements: setting, very well developed secondary characters, flawed but lovable main characters, conflict, squeal-inducing romance. On the surface, the two books are very different, but if you read carefully, you'll notice a lot of things in common. Part of me is disappointed by the formulaic feel. But another part is really impressed. Stephanie figured out just what makes a romance novel work and how to take significantly different plots and characters and fit both into the formula.<br /><br />Elements:<br /><br />Main Characters:<br /><br />Lola makes and breaks this book for me. I love Lola's vivacity. I love how she is an accomplished seamstress and is obsessed with costumes. Her costumes make her personality shine while also masking a deep-seeded insecurity. She is also stubborn, self-righteous, and quick to jump to conclusions. A fairly normal teen. Overall, she is a more engaging character than Anna. I'll address my problems with her in the conflict section.<br /><br />Cricket. I can't say his name without a little squeal. What a fabulous guy! He's as nice as can be. Awkward and nerdy. A little insecure. Very patient. I love that, despite being a freshman in college, he's more \\"boyish\\" than many of the typical YA \\"men.\\"<br /><br />Conflict: Three's a crowd. In Anna, Etienne's girlfriend was the conflict. In Lola, it's Lola's boyfriend. Lola is dating Max, a hip, indie rockstar in his early 20s. This is the main problem I had with Lola. Not that her relationship wasn't written well. Rather, I spent a good portion of the book wanting to use said book to slap Lola upside the head. Lola and Max exemplify why teenage girls should not date older guys. Lola loses herself around Max. She hero-worships him. If Max told her that she doesn't look good in pink, she'd throw away every pink outfit she had, even if it was her favorite color. I see why she likes him - he's sexy, charming, and talented. But Max is a jerk - controlling, self-righteous, arrogant. The type of guy who thinks it's cool to mold a young girl into what he wants her to be. Lola isn't old enough or self-confident enough to recognize that for a long time. I thought Lola's relationship with her boyfriend was very realistic, but it was hard to read.<br /><br />Well Developed Secondary Characters: Anna focused on friends, as one expects in a boarding school setting. The strongest characters in Lola are her parents: her dads Nathan and Andy and her mom Norah. This is the first book I've read where a character's parents were gay. I loved how their \\"differentness\\" wasn't a plot point in Lola. They were fabulous parents who happened to be gay. Nathan and Andy are attentive dads, funny, caring, thoughtful, and have raised Lola to shine. I loved how close Lola was to her parents. Lola's ne'er-do-well biological mother easily could have been a flat, loser character, but we see that she is neither good nor bad. There are good friend characters. Lola's best friend Lindsay was fabulous. Funny, loyal, and quirky yet avoided the crazy best friend stereotype. I also found Calliope, Cricket's twin sister, to be a layered, if not likable character.<br /><br />Romance: Just as sweet as in Anna! The perfect mixture of friendship and passion. We get to know each character before anything happens. Unlike most YA novels, we witness the build-up. No insta-love. Technically, Lola and Cricket have had a thing for each other their whole lives, but their relationship slowly changes from a stand-off, to friendship, to romance. It feels like something that could actually occur in real life. I like that the romance isn't entirely hot and heavy. It's sweet and touching more than anything else.<br /><br />Companion: Stephanie Perkins understands the definitely of a companion novel! Anna and Etienne are characters in Lola. But it's not a disguised sequel. They add another layer to the story. The book would function fine without them, but it's better because they're there. They never try to steal Lola and Cricket's thunder.<br /><br />Setting: Love the San Francisco setting. It doesn't have the depth that Paris did in Anna, but Lola highlights some of the quirky sides of San Francisco that you don't normally see.<br /><br />If I had to choose between Lola and the Boy Next Door and Anna and the French Kiss, I'd probably choose Anna. I like Lola better than Anna, but I like Etienne a little better than Cricket (is that blasphemy?). I love how Lola and Anna feel very similar yet entirely different. Lola and the Boy Next Door is a sweet story with fun characters, fabulous romance, and a great plot that will immediately hook you. Just like Lola the girl, Lola and the Boy Next Door is glowing neon and full of life.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 / 5ing more than anything else.  Companion: Stephanie Perkins understands the definitely of a companion novel! Anna and Etienne are characters in Lola. But it's not a disguised sequel. They add another layer to the story. The book would function fine without them, but it's better because they're there. They never try to steal Lola and Cricket's thunder.  Setting: Love the San Francisco setting. It doesn't have the depth that Paris did in Anna, but Lola highlights some of the quirky sides of San Francisco that you don't normally see.   If I had to choose between Lola and the Boy Next Door and Anna and the French Kiss, I'd probably choose Anna. I like Lola better than Anna, but I like Etienne a little better than Cricket (is that blasphemy?). I love how Lola and Anna feel very similar yet entirely different. Lola and the Boy Next Door is a sweet story with fun characters, fabulous romance, and a great plot that will immediately hook you. Just like Lola the girl, Lola and the Boy Next Door is glowing neon and full of life.  Rating: 4.5 / 5
1400052181|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down.  I'm in a bookclub and this was one of the books we had to read.  I normally would not even had tried reading this book; but I'm so glad that I did.  The history of genetics alone and how this one woman has saved so many lives in the generations since her death is amazing.  I recommend everyone to read this book.  I think that this would be a great book for a high school science class to read and do a report on.  My bookclub talked on this book for an extra hour the night we met.  So many different opinions on what each person got from the book.     I think it is wonderful that this writer chose this woman to write about and that we all got to meet Henrietta Lacks (even in print form) and that she might not be forgotten of her contribution to science.
B005RK6EUS|5.0|This is episode 13 of series 6. It has all of the previous characters: Madame Kovarian, River, Amy, Rory, Churchill, Dorian, the Silence, among others. \\"The Wedding of River Song\\" really delivers. Many questions are answered, but there is one that is finally asked in this episode. \\"When the question is asked, the Silence will fall.\\" You won't find out the question until the very end (the last sentence of the episode). Alex Kinsington really shows her wide range of acting. River really loves the Doctor and it shows. This is a not-to-be-missed episode. Much of the season is re-capped in the beginning. So, if you have missed an episode during this series, you will be brought up-to-date. I am so glad I bought this, so I can watch it again and again.

B00466HN86|5.0|\\"Courageous\\" is largely about four deputies in a large sheriff's department in a mixed suburban and metropolitan area.  It details some of the dangers, temptations and excitement inherent in their job.  However, even more so it shows us how they interact with each other and their families, especially how they deal with tragedy and learn from it.    The film does have some action scenes involving gang violence, arrests and shootouts.  As such it is appropriately rated at PG-13 and I would not have brought my 7 year old daughter to it, but think it would be okay for most teenagers.  The action scenes are not the bulk of the movie and happen early on to introduce the characters and then more toward the end, by which time I was at the edge of my seat to see who would live or die.  However, as I alluded to before, the action scenes are not the bulk of the movie and take a back seat often to the character interactions.  The acting is generally good and the characters believable, with some only slightly over the top humor at times.  The humor actually is used nicely to lighten things up a bit as some of the characters are forced to deal with a tragedy in their family.  The storyline is relatively linear, but not totally predictable as the actions of some characters came as quite a surprise to me.  As part of this the story was made more believable by some revelations mid-way through the movie about some of the characters that showed their less than perfect lives and values.  I often do not see movies like this, since I am a somewhat typical man who prefers big blockbuster SF or other action oriented films.  However, I went to see this movie at my local multiplex yesterday on a date with my wife and found myself really enjoying the movie.  The people attending were a mix of adults and teenagers, with about an equal mix of men and women.  I met a couple of people I knew there and they seemed to have enjoyed the film.  By the end of the movie I had cheered on the heroes, laughed at the humor, enjoyed the action scenes and even gotten somewhat teary eyed at parts (during which my wife did some solid crying).  Overall I would say that this film was well done, with an engaging story, characters you could believe in and with a storyline that really makes you think hard even when it is over.  I had fun with the movie, but also find it challenging as perhaps you will also if you choose to see it.

B003NFM3JK|4.0|There are certain things about this animated  Disney version of \\"The Christmas Carol\\" that are unique and amazing.  However, there are other things that are mundane and quite lacking in creativity.  When Charles Dickens wrote this beloved tale it was told in a simple manner with a good life's lesson to be learned.  However, the lack of concentration on the Bob Crachit family was appalling.  One of the most important aspects of the Dicken's tale (besides the revival of a GOOD Ebenezer Scrooge) was the strength of this little family as they stood up to poverty with grace and dignity. Yes, there are scenes with the little family gathering about the  Christmas table, but they were  too short.  You never really get to know or understand who and what they were.  Once Ebenezer has a change of heart you don't experience the joy that such a dramatic change should bring.  It simply fell flat. Scenes with  the Ghost of Christmas Past were bright and creative and beautifully done.  Seeing young Ebenezer before he became the miser frankly fell flat.  However, it was delightful seeing his old employer and his wife as they exploded with Christmas cheer.  I felt as if the makers of this film rushed the story and the viewer was left wanting the missing pieces of a puzzle. The film is colorful and the art work is very good, but  I felt that it was only half a story being told, and wondered where the rest of the tale might be.  One does not experience the sudden wonder when the change takes place in Scrooge and you miss that.  I \\"liked\\" the film, but I did not love it.
1400069181|5.0|The story of TOMS and its founders is one of the most inspirational I've ever read.  It's a simple story about how a small group of visionaries make a huge impact on the lives of thousands of needy people every single day.<br /><br />TOMS is a shoe company that donates a free pair of shoes to a destitute child for each pair it sells. It's a remarkable idea that forces one to consider the good a single company, or individual for that matter, can do to improve the world.<br /><br />One can argue the economic wisdom of combining social conscience spending with capitalism, but to a shoeless child the debate is pointless. One can even argue if the TOMS model is the best way to bestow charitable gifts. But what can't be argued is the positively unique way a single entity has been able to make a huge difference to so many souls.<br /><br />The book points to TOMS as a model to be emulated by other enterprises to fight poverty one small step at a time. Consequently, it offers a few ideas on how other companies can design their own projects. Imagine thousands of businesses instituting similar philanthropic programs. It's a fascinating concept that just may shed a ray of sunshine into an otherwise gloomy existence.<br /><br />In my humble opinion this book highlights TOMS as an example of capitalism at its very best. It's a clear precedent of how profits can impact poverty. While no one company can end world hunger, if enough compassionate capitalists took up the TOMS banner they could certainly advance the cause. And everybody wins in a world like that.<br /><br />Joe Waynick, Author<br />\\"Internet Bookselling Made Easy!\\" series<br />[...]
1936850028|5.0|I'm only halfway through the book \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" by Walter Rhein.  Inspiring introduction by Dave Landgraf.  Well written - the humor will keep you turning pages and the perseverence will encourage you to leave the couch!  I think he's as funny as Bill Bryson and Gary Keillor!
B003L77GRO|5.0|Mmmmmmmmmmm, where to start. We know Dexter has to cope with the loss of Rita's death and the responsibility of being a single father. But what of his Dark Passenger? It still needs it's release. We start to find out slowly that Dexter is having actual human emotion, and after he kills an innocent?, out of frustration. Not by Harry's code yet,\\"That's the first human thing you've done since Rita died.\\" We have a new investigation, the barrel girls, started by Dexter from being seen in action. This season really starts to take off as we meet a tortured woman saved by Dexter. Julia styles(Lumen), her performance is unbelievable, and I'll stop here not to give anything away. Other new cast members include, Peter Weller(Robocop) and Johnny Lee Miller(Hackers,Trainspotting),whose performances are genuinely real and will make you hate or love them. Another great season that I think is better than season four which was also unbelievable. Top notch Drama.

0385737955|5.0|I Throughty loved this book! The premace for the story is so unique and I still have not seen anything with a more unique plot! Maze Runner is about a boy named Thomas who remembers nothing about his past life and wakes up in an elevator which takes him to the mysterious Glade filled with 16-9 year old boys. This book is full of mystery and exitement! However in the last few pages it does get a little...... Blood-and-Gutsy. I think That the book definently should be PG-13. However ignoring the graphic violence at the end of the story, altogether it is one of the better Dystopian Books out there today. It is a VERY Worthwhile read, Just be prepared for some violence! If you like Dystopian Books or even if you don't you will LOVE this book! I certainly did! James Dashner is up there with the greats on my list!   P.S Scorch Trials is Just as spectacular!
B000WTNCYA|5.0|At first, I thought \\"Who is this woman?\\". I had to own her album! I bought it and then I thought her style was way too much like Peggy Lee for my liking. The longer I listened, the more relaxed and soothed I felt. Now her music just haunts me. The sensation is as unique as is her music. She is what legends are made of.
0739344269|5.0|By far one of the most engaging and interesting audio cd's available. Some books work and some don't as an audio cd. This one works exceptionally well.  If you have a highly advanced understanding of the cosmology, theoretical physics (ie you've had graduate level training) then you might find the better part of the tome to be many things you already know. As a chemist, I've had just enough advanced physics courses to be dangerous, and have tried to keep up with developments over time. Yet I still found the overview to be enjoyable and a proper set up for some of the more theoretical arguments made at the tail end of the book.  Hawking tries to line up the large philosophical questions against developments in our understandings of the universe and the laws and theories that have been tested and adapted over time. As he does so, he walks back from the ancient greeks to modern theories on gravity, string theory and m-theory. That would be a daunting task even if your readers were highly knowledgeable scholars with solid footing in the history of knowledge, philosophy and science. You should appreciate how tough that would be when your intended audience is the general population. I'm sure anyone can find fault with this or that example, depending on their own area of professional expertise, but I think the story is crafted artfully and the arguments made in an interesting and engaging way.  I'm not surprised that many folks have strong feelings of dislike about the book. No one is going to be able to talk about ontological, metaphysical or epistemological theories without many folks feeling like they have to get defensive about their own personal point of view. Spend some time reading the negative reviews of this book and that is apparent. If you aren't open to listening to a highly knowledgable person crafting a theory over how all of the modern knowledge in theoretical physics ties together, even when the implications of that attempt contradict what you believe, thendon't bother with this book. It will certainly frustrate you.   If on the other hand, you are open to listening to / reading an engaging and extremely knowledgeable review of our understanding of the universe, from a scientific point of view, and how one scientist thinks it all fits together, then you'll absolutely love this book as much as I did.

B005CW5E3E|5.0|I've always thought Johnny's studio albums were far superior to his live work. Not since White Hot and Blue have I heard him in such great voice, having such a good time! The lineup of guests is brilliant, and they all shine in thier own way, and each gives Johnny a chance to display his versatility, with the many blues styles that he has mastered. As another reviewer has noted, if you didn't know that the guest was the first solo, there would be no way to tell them apart. Too often listening to records in the recent past have I found one or three cuts that I liked. Listening to this last night for the first time I found myself ecstatic with each cut as it came through. A great work from an under-rated Mster of the Blues!

0030862108|4.0|Dee Brown tells the history of how the West was won from the perspective of those who lost it.  From the Indian perspective, the white settlers are like locusts who multiply in unfathomable numbers and who destroy the land.  Time and again, the Americans push the Indians westward, breaking treaties in the process.  Some of the Americans have genuine empathy for the Indians and want to do right by them.  But these attempts are undercut by others who take advantage of the political imperative of Western expansion -- or are simply forgotten when the next bureaucrat or military man takes over the reins of power.    Sometimes the conflict escalates into the kind of indiscriminate slaughter of native settlements (such as at the Sand Creek Massacre)one later sees at My Lai.  The Indians too engage in retaliatory raids against settlers, but Brown portrays this as done rarely and usually by hotheads not acting with proper authorization.  It is not clear if Brown underplays this problem, though it is clear that like African slaves, the Indians engaged in far less rebellion and atrocity than they were probably entitled to.    The nobility of the Indian chiefs and warriors and the hopelessness of their situation are well portrayed.  Less well done is a good description of the kind of culture that was being replaced.  Brown does convey a picture of the Indians as living in absolute harmony and in balance with nature.  They are a nomadic and seemingly happy culture.  But the book does not attempt to give a good picture of this.  It is simply assumed that the Indian culture is a healthy one and in many respects a superior one to the whites.  The problem with Brown's approach is that he dwells too much on conferring victim status on the Indians.  They certainly were victimized, but to do justice to the culture one has to describe it.  Otherwise we only define the Indian as he relates to the white settlers.    I suspect that while Brown romanticizes Indian culture, the Indian tribesdid represent a great civilization.  Certainly the nobility of the people comes through in the telling of the behavior of their chiefs.    Clearly, this civilization never had a chance.  The Americans had the weight of the census behind them -- as well as a technological advantage and a need to expand.  Pit this against a culture living in balance with nature with no expansionist needs, and one knows the result.    How do we as a people come to terms with our history?  It appears that our initial approach was to blame the victim.  Many of the negative qualities that we attributed to the Indians were simply projections of our own shortcomings -- i.e., bloodthirsty savages, \\"Indian givers\\", and treaty breakers.  It is depressing to see that in the face of the historical inevitability of the triumph over the Indians and the will to power that characterizes American westward expansion, ideology and political rhetoric are bent to serve the interests of the conquerors.  How serious are we about out own ideals if they can be twisted so easily to support the accomplishment of a great historical wrong?    Brown's book was an important step in coming to terms with our past.  Let's not get defensive about it or sugarcoat it.  After all, Hitler viewed the conquest of the American West as the model for his conquest of the the European East.    The next step would be a more searching study of the native cultures, one that does not romanticize them.  And finally we as a culture should attempt to learn something from the culture we displaced, including a commitment to treat the land in a way that does justice to our forebears.

I don't think he'll be everyone's cup of tea, however.<br /><br />It is my opinion that the first 100 pages is far superior to the second.<br /><br />5 stars for ambiance.

B005RK6EUS|3.0|We all knew that Lake Silencio was not the end of the Doctor.  How they got around it was satisfying but it left more questions to be answered.  And the bad part?  They reveal how he does not die in the last almost 10 seconds of the show.  The rest?  Not satisfying.    I waited in eager anticipation for this episode.  It was very very unsatisfying.  Like wanting a hamburger with fries and being given a rice cake.  Thin.  Tasteless.  Leaves you still hungry and not satisfied.  This is how I felt after this finale.  The ending is interesting and is, actually, the whole episode.  The rest of it, including the acting just felt unsatisfying.  More than 3/4 of the episode was gone before any real answer-related action started.  And what was shown, was a back story with little explanation or connection, except showing the Blue Man again.    Since most of the episode shows Matt Smith acting alone or with minor characters, the flaws in his acting abilities show up horribly.  He needs the others to play off.  Here he seemed uncomfortable and unreal, but I guess . . . ooops spoiler . . . Perhaps that is understandable.  But it was noticeable how poorly he acts.  In my view, they all seemed to act really poorly.  Further, what is UP with the awful Doctor's dirty clothing?  They are just awful and you can almost tell they spent very little time or money on that costume for him.  It was annoyingly distracting.  And the oldest question in the universe, which is revealed?  That was a big freaking joke.  It is impossible that THAT is the oldest question in the universe  Bah!  Overall, disappointing and unsatisfying.  Compared to how the season started, this was grossly unsatisfying.  We are left with huge holes of logic and lots of questions.    Lots of questions remained unanswered and not even addressed from this season.  The only questions answered are we learn who River is to the Doctor, but in my view that isn't even clear given everything else we are shown in the last 10 seconds.  We also learn what the question is.  We have no hints as to the answer.  I'm for not having all spoilers and all plot twists revealed, but this was just ridiculous.  When the episode was over, I kept thinking, IS THAT ALL?  An unsatisfying finale.  It was more a filler episode than anything else.  I give it 3 stars for the visual effects in the 1st half and the ending.  The rest was just really disappointing.
B000J4CXHU|5.0|I love this book.  It's a perfect gift to give a new mom.  I was fortunate to be able to hear the author read this book several years ago in Canada.  There were hundreds of us in the audience.  We were all in tears. It's beautifully written.  Not a lot of words, but he nails it with the words he uses.  Buy it, you'll be glad.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|Although I didn't purchase this movie through Amazon, I thought I'd enjoy having this Blu-ray combo pack. The movie is fun. Better in my opinion than I would have thought. The action is fast and the CG has come a long way in the short time between the first and third movies.   My one complaint is that although, you get a combo pack with the DVD and a digital copy, you get no extra features. If I had known that, I'd have waited to purchase it at later date. I thought it was insulting to include a coupon for the 3D copy of the movie in the package itself.   Will I purchase the next version with all the extras? No.   Buyers who don't care for any extra features will be happy with this version. The transfer to Blu-ray is very good. Surround sound works great on a home theater system.   The story is really only an excuse for the action. Don't think about it because there is very little plot. It's a fun popcorn movie but missing vital information for those interested in any of the background information.

B000002H97|5.0|Yes, the legendary BLACK ALBUM from the METAL LEGEND METALLICA...it´s not like the fast THRASH of KILL EM ALL or MASTER OF PUPPETS, but in a more mainstream vein...NOTHING ELSE MATTERS is a great song, but WAY WAY POP to METALLICA...but think about the heavy riff of SAD BUT TRUE, THROUGH THE NEVER, OF WOLF AND MAN and WHEREVER I MAY ROAM...This is a great great album!!!! a little different from past fast THRASH records, but a CLASSIC from the mainstream HEAVY METAL!!!! Many say this album sucks for being too polished and even pop, but this is a TRUE CLASSIC!!! and come on, the legendary BLACK ALBUM is WAY WAY better than LOAD/ RELOAD / ST ANGER years....Anyway, the TRUE METALLICA THAT I LOVE goes really until THE BLACK ALBUM...the first 5 METALLICA albuns are MASTERPIECES!!!! WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!
B0055V6EZE|3.0|I first heard/saw this on the PBS broadcast.  Was knocked out by Laurie's piano skills and his feel for this music (were the arrangements his?).  His guitaring and most vocals, not so much.  He has the soul, but not the larynx, to sing most of these songs and did the music a disservice in most cases.  In one case, his few bars of \\"Good Night Irene\\", he desecrated the song with both his guitar and his voice.  The two or three exceptions:  St. James Infirmary (a virtuoso performance), Tipitina and (maybe) Let Them Talk.  I don't want to buy the whole CD, but I will download a tune or two.  Also, I'm glad that Tom Jones loves this kind of music, but when he sings it, it sounds like, well, like it's been run thru a Tom Jones vocal blender).

B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera is one of the greatest bands of the metal world. In the 90´s, i think Pantera was the top metal band of the world with Sepultura. I really never have seen the Pantera albuns that came before Cowboys, so this is where Pantera begins for me. All the songs are good, some are classics like Cowboys, Primal Concrete sledge, Psycho Holiday and Cemetery Gates. From Cowboys from Hell to The Great Southern Trendkill, Pantera dominates the 90´s metal world.

A magical, mystery tour through Martin's imagination that has held me captive for many, many intriguing hours.  Book 5, where are you?
B000RZGFYS|5.0|Slayer is the thrashiest band of the world. If you listen to all Slayer albuns you can say many things, but they never had slow down the heaviness of their sound. Reign in Blood is the most famous Slayer album, and many can say this is the greatest thrash metal album of all time. Sometimes i think it is. All the songs are great, there´s no filler and the album runs in 30 minutes, so you will  want more Slayer after hear this classic. South of Heaven and Seasons in the Abyss are great, but Reign in Blood is where Slayer became the metal god they are
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the series, particularly the characters' personal interaction when stranded aboard a giant starship. What I found tedious was their interaction with earth, which was only an unneccessary distraction from the major events that took place. If you're stranded, remain stranded. Don't introduce completely bizarre interactions. It only serves to weaken the premise of the show.

B005HGKW6E|5.0|The movie is about how fragile our rights are and how quickly we can lose them, when we are linked with an unpopular person and powerful people use that link to pervert justice for their own ends.  In this case it was for the mother of potential criminal, Mary Surratt  Thank you Mr Redford for this powerful movie.  For a modern day example read about Lynne Stewart on wikipedia  I had a perverse experience with our legal system.  While relatively minor, it affected me.  Basically I made a smart ass remark at a traffic stop, and was arrested and sent to jail, and my car impounded.  At first the charge was for an illegal lane change (I didn't signal when 2 lanes came together.  This was escalated after the fact for refusing to provide a license (untrue), then re-escalated 30 days later to interfering with a police officer (another lie) then I fought it and went to trial.  The trial was mistrial.  I was then given 4 new charges of interfering, obstruction of justice and 2 felony counts of perjury.  The fines were $265,000 and 12 years in jail.  For an \\"illegal lane change\\".  I'm ashamed to admit that I finally caved after spending 7 months defending myself and plead no contest  on the condition I paid no fine and did no community service.  For this, ridiculousness my local government spent 10's of thousands of dollars.  This has shown me, personally just how fragile our system is, and how easily it is perverted when someone in the government wants a particular outcome, and unfortunately how little respect for civil rights exist in the country anymore, Especially by those in law enforcement, and justice that we the taxpayers PAY to protect our rights.  We deserve, expect and should demand better.

Changing the order of these scenes completely undermines the human story and conflict at the core of the film.\\"  Okay, I have a problem with this comment.  First of all, Superman CAN have sex with a human, but relationships are more than just about having sex.  He cannot have a NORMAL HUMAN RELATIONSHIP with Lois, because he ISN'T A HUMAN.  So, this critique is weak at the core of it's own essence.    I like the Donner cut very much, and I find it has the proper continuity to the first film, and to Superman.  The inclusion of Jor-El is more than necessary, in explaining how he gets his powers back.  In the Lester version, we have no idea how it happens, and merely having the green crystal existing doesn't really explain how or if Jor-El's spirit is alive or not, and how it all works.  The spiritual link between Jor-El and Kal-El is what makes it all work; deviating from this distorts the story.    Now, let's be fair here.  Donner had to use whatever survived in order to put together \\"what likely would have been his vision\\", but 20 years plus after the fact.  He cannot go back in time to film what he needs, in order to fully realise his second film.  The Salkind's got cheap, and for that we got a sequel that is good, but not great like the second film.  The comedic camp elements that Lester includes take away from the seriousness of the story (films are always about a story).  We can see where 3 and 4 went, so I rest my case.  And, if Donner could have finished his film back in 1977-79, he would have edited it accordingly, and likely would have an even better film than what we now have.  Anyone with half a brain should know this, and be able to piece together what cannot be obtained.  We can never know what Superman II should have and could have turned out back in 1981... but this is as close as we can get.  And for that, this makes me concludemy review that it is indeed priceless.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|This is a good movie.  Just stay away from this version.  I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film.  I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only.  Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only.  I used to download movies illegally.  I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable.  When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated.  Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it.  This is just my rant.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This a nice calming game. It has it's complicated points, but nothing too frustrating. Looks good. Sounds good. and long enough to get your money's worth.
B0055SWM08|5.0|if you like puzzle games or games that make you think this is must a buy I highly recommend this game. it is very polished and worth every penny at 99&cent; this is a steal
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I won't comment about the story of this great, gripping, 5-star book: I just want to clarify one thing about the Kindle editions (there are two), since there are many reviewers recommending to avoid \\"the Kindle Edition\\" altogether. I bought both of them, and what I have to say is that the kindle edition you should avoid is Bantam's [..], which is shamefully riddled with typos (some of them: \\"Dome\\", \\"torncat\\", \\"s word\\", \\"sept on\\", \\"arid\\" instead of \\"Dorne\\", \\"tomcat\\", \\"sword\\", \\"septon\\" and \\"and\\"). The Voyager edition, though, is much, much better (not only with none or few typos, but also with a table of contents and more maps).
B005IEGUDY|3.0|This is a very well done, well written book.  The plot is smooth, the details are very nice, and you can actually conjure up the sights and smells of Salisbury through time.  However, it is just too much of a good thing.  It is long - a true endurance test.  At times, I thought more about how much I had to go than what was happening in the story...  Additionally, the ending - the final few paragraphs - I understand how he brings it full circle, and his intent on what he wants the reader to understand.  But without giving it away, I think it could be better.  Overall, I'm glad I've read this book.  Just wish that it was two books instead of 1.
B004GYY714|5.0|No complaints....none what so ever. Great selection of stations..and reception is great. No ear phones needed. All shows are avilable too.
0545265355|5.0|In beginning this book it been a long time since I had read for pleasure. This series came highly recommended from a respected friend so I thought I would try it even though it is not something I would have picked on my own. I feel you can't properly review this book with out giving away so many key elements, even where the title comes from. All I can say is this story will be with me for the rest of my life. I found it empowering as well as intense. I couldn't put it down, I read even if I only had 10 minutes to spare, the books were by my side. This is not for the faint of heart so if you want fluff, keep moving. If  you admire the under dog, the quest of understanding your past and fighting for what you believe in you will love this book as much as I did. Don't miss out!
B004OVDVBQ|4.0|This book was compelling. It gripped me from page one. It contains excellent descriptions of OCD and PTSD - and well researched information about treatment options. Whilst the plot was a little thin at times I was still fully engaged with the story-line. The ending was a little disappointing - I was left feeling frustrated by the loose ends. However I am looking forward to reading another book by Elizabeth Haynes. She has an interesting and innovative style which I really enjoyed. I recommend this book for anyone who is seeking a good, gripping and clever suspense novel.
B0043ZDU1E|4.0|The music, the voice, beautiful, soothing. Although the disk plays well on my car stereo, it will not play on my home unit. Admittedly, the home unit is an older model, but I was surprised when I inserted the disk and got a \\"No Disk\\" message on the status panel.
1564021017|5.0|I have been reading this book to my baby for several months now and it has become one of his favorite books.  His face lights up and he smiles whenever I read it to him.  The illustrations are beautiful and the story is warm.  It's also the perfect length book for babies.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This 2002 new version missed the whole point of the story.  It's just another computerized action movie.  If you are young and had never read the book or seen the older version with Robert Taylor, than this might be a fun movie for you.  That's the reason for the two stars.  I would have given it only a one star rating.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I love Harry Bosch.  Michael Connolly has given us a great character, who holds up over all the books.  These 3 short tales are all VERY good.  I have all the Bosch books, and have read them all more than once.  Bosch is right up there with Jack Reacher, Lee Child's wonderful character.  I love Harry's insistence of following his \\"gut\\" and not letting the obvious keep him from finding the truth.  Three very good stories at a fantastic price; give yourself a sweet treat.
B000PC0S5K|3.0|This book had a lot of good concepts. My favorite being the pain-body.   I did find this book hard to follow at times because the author jumps around so much.  Some of these concepts have been told before, but overall an interesting read.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I am a FAN of Lee Child, especially the Jack Reacher books. This is one of the best! I won't go into a lot of detail, previous reviewers have done this.  For me Reacher is the best continuing characters being written today.     I understand all the Reacher books have been optioned for the screen.  I read the other day that Tom Cruise is going to play Jack Reacher in a movie soon....this is unbelievable!!! This will be the worst possible casting.  Short, cute Cruise is NOT 6'5\\", not particularly handsome, powerfully strong, Jack Reacher. Please Mr. Child, do not let this happen!!!    For new readers of the series this is a great book to begin with, then read the rest in order.  I have them all on my bookshelf, The Affair on my Kindle.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|My only request is that you provide an option to color the days in the past. This would allow the eyes to focus on today in an easier fashion. Thank you again!

B005POK858|5.0|Let's all admit, there's a lot of crappy RPGs out there for our phones. This company, however, is leading the way; demonstrating once again that it's possible to have a great RPG to run for our platform. And all of this bang for 3.99? That's the same price as my favorite large coffee at Starbucks! To have a stunning game like this for this price is freakin ridiculous. I'm sold, especially since it's on sale. So now I can get my coffee and this game too. Beautiful!
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Emma Stone very convincingly plays the role of Skeeter.  She is ahead of her time in the Civil Rights movement and wants to get the voice of the black maid out in open society.
1609611543|5.0|A year ago I attended a cardiology seminar where the cardiologist/lecturer emphasized the supposed importance of a \\"diet rich in whole grains and complex carbohydrates\\" for cardiovascular health and avoidance of atherosclerosis. Without any credible scientific references or support, of course.  His power-point presentation even included a photo of a giant head of wheat.  I was torn between wanting to find a hard solid surface to bang my head into and wanting to scream and call him out on the errors, disrupting the august assembly.  But where would I start?  There are so many problems with wheat that I couldn't begin to even touch the surface in a Q&A session following the seminar.    William Davis MD has belatedly solved my problem.  I'll just send the lecturer his own copy of this book and he might realize that he is actually promoting cardiovascular disease, insulin resistence, premature aging, obesity and a host of other problems.  The problem is that the lecturer was stuck in the 80's and 90's when some really bad \\"science\\" was embraced and promoted that gave us today's obesity epidemic and a host of accompanying medical problems.  The results of a lot of peer reviewed scientific research on wheat, its components, and their effect on human health is emerging.  And it is essentially all going one direction though on numerous fronts - against wheat.  This is unusual.  Usually there is a lot of back and forth in medical journal reporting.  Five studies on green tea will suggest a correlation with, say, decreased prostate cancer and three will not, or something like that. But with wheat it is different.  The vast weight of research is consistently going against wheat and against a number of its constituents and wheat is being consistently linked with bad health outcomes.  Dr. Davis pulls this research together, including some of the most recent, and presents it in a readable, understandable and even entertaining manner.   The only criticism I have of the book is thesomewhat limiting title, Wheat Belly.  The book aptly covers the problem of persistent obesity, especially abdominal obesity, caused by wheat.  The author refers to independent studies strongly supporting this proposition.  But the book is about far more than obesity and the author also demonstrates the role of wheat in inducing brain dysfunction and damage, dementia, schizophrenia, ataxia, gastrointestinal problems, reflux, numerous skin conditions, premature aging, rheumatoid arthritis, many other autoimmune disorders, and many other conditions.  He also addresses something that few others have adequately considered, the addictive character of wheat.  Wheat contains opioid peptides and components that can produce a withdrawal reaction lasting some days when it is completely eliminated from diet and Dr. Davis confirms that one must persevere in face of these transient withdrawal symptoms in order to achieve the great long term feeling and benefits of being off wheat.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Widgets won't work for me on droid x.  Otherwise very good and easy to use,  even for a lefty!  It copies my screen written words to the note and it is still legible.
0439023513|5.0|It is impossible to review this book without having spoilers of some kind so if you haven't read this, steer clear of this review.  I enjoyed this book from the beginning but I didn't get excited until Peeta came into the picture.  In my opinion, Peeta is the star in this series, not Katniss.  I also think that the 1st person point of view is genius for making him the star.  I LOVE Peeta. I really don't know how this is a YA book because  this is the kind of book that robs people of their innocence and  could cause a few nightmares.  Finnick...broke my heart.  I wish I saw more Haymitch because he was a favorite of mine and his sense of humor would have relieved some of the...darkness.  Prim...I wasn't too devastated.  Prim was important to Katniss.  Katniss wouldn't have entered nor survived the games without her.  The bigger story, the capitol, was always important to the other characters.  It was the important story so I didn't think the ending made everything that Katniss did all for nothing.  It was sad but Finnick made me feel worse.  I'm not going to say that you'll like everything that happens.  I will say that it is consistently a well-told, well-written story that keeps the reader invested.  Will it break your heart?  Well that's the thing.  That's a chance you have to take.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Awesome port of the game I loved on PC. Loads a bit slowly at times, but the gameplay mechanics never fail. Works great on my modded HD2.
0439023491|5.0|How to you review something that has been reviewed by the world?  Catching Fire was actually my favorite out of the series.  I loved the witty interplay between the characters and I found myself touched time and time again by their stories.  The build up to the games was fantastic and I was a bit scared to enter the arena again.  What can I say, I'm sensitive.  I thought I was going to get more of the same once entering the arena, but the whole book threw me for a loop.  I just didn't see the end coming.  I thought Ms. Collins did an excellent job leading into the third book without leaving the reader (me) frustrated.  I liked Katniss more in this book, but Haymitch and Peeta have my heart.
B0050PYNN0|4.0|I think poor marketing and critical indifference led to this film's failure to find it's audience at the box office.  The title led you to believe that this was Cheech and Chong go Medieval.  There are a few instances of imbibing the herb but for the most part it's a rousing action-adventure comedy.  James Franco, Danny McBride, and Natalie Portman are engaging and the effects are pretty good.  Not classic stuff but it's endearing enough for undiscriminating viewers to give it a toke.
0312427999|5.0|No one could make this stuff up! Scared the hell out of me and my husband, who is really a history buff. YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK TO UNDERSTAND the power and pressures of the 1%. Takes long look at Chicago school of economics and how these people have been and are bring down democracies around the world. President Obama taught at CU for ten years & he surrounds himself with same people responsible for Crisis Economics - Disaster Capitalism - American Facism. \\"There are a very few books that really help us understand the present. THE SHOCK DOCTRINE is one of those books,\\" John Gray wrote in THE GUARDIAN. MUST READ!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I was sorry to finish this Reacher story. I was thoroughly caught up in it and couldn't decide if Devereux or Riley was the killer, half the time thinking she was, half the time thinking he was. Very dark view of the upper echelons of the military and the Senate, but unfortunately quite credible. It was also good to learn about Reacher's start as a roamer. Very much enjoyed the book. Certainly one of Child's better efforts. The downside is I waited weeks for the book to be available and finished it in a day. I have to add that I was pleased to see the Kindle edition priced below the hardbound. Too many are the other way around and I refuse to pay more for an ebook than for one that is much more expensive to manufacture and distribute.

B005K2KCPG|2.0|I agree with quite a few others that almost all the songs here are generic sounding Sammy Hagar songs (maybe something solo).  Not even the great guitar player can save these songs.  The only song I like is the last one, Something Gone Wrong!  And that describes the rest of this CD for me.  I was really surprised by the first Chickenfoot CD, the songs were really catchy GREAT HOOKS that had you stompin your foot!  And I'm not even the biggest Hagar fan, I did like Montrose and selective Van Hagar!  But that first CD really nailed it and it was a surprise hit going GOLD!  I just dont see the same thing happening here, I dont think it's going to catch on like the first one!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Very retro, straight forward. I didn't know mobile games could keep my interest over 10 minutes until I played this. Touch interface is very intuitive. Worth the price.
0679735909|5.0|I have probably read \\"Possession\\" a dozen times, and it endears itself more with each reading.  If, however, you are thinking of seeing the film, don't.  A miserable, dumbed-down, Hollywood-ized piece of dreck.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth Hart has been a favorite singer of mine since 1993's Star Search, which she dominated!  Beth is the best blues-rocker since Janis and I think she is better and more versatile than Joplin ever was.  I have every Joe Bonamassa CD and DVD there is.  He is my favorite guitarist of all time.  What a very special treat that they collaborated on this album.  Please, if you like music, order this CD today!  You will not be disappointed.  You owe it to yourself to experience this.  The only sin I can think of is if Beth and Joe don't do a follow-up album - they are so GREAT together!
B00454U1O2|5.0|I bought this for my step-daughter and we both love it!  Pink's songs are so upbeat and fun and the slow tunes are done beautifully.  You can't go wrong with the greatest hits album!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I am impressed. Before buying it I read several reviews. Maybe not everything in Rome was exactly the way it is portrayed in the series, but it gives us an interesting insight. Because I do not think I can add to much to what was already said about this masterpiece, I will comment on other features like the possibility to run audio in many different languages. This is invaluable. I speak German and Spanish and I am benefiting of that possibility, but if you are just learning any of the several languages, you can use this collection also as a practice tool.
B001DD63UO|5.0|I loved seeing this tour when Pink came to Philly, she has the best dance moves and acrobatics...and even sings beautfully while hanging upside down from a trapeze!  This album is a ton of fun with one hit after another.  I know Pink was going through some tough times while working on this album and she used it as great inspiration to produce some really great and powerful hits!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have only finished this book moments ago and I already miss the joy I had from reading it. The book is just simply amazing. Actually, amazing doesn't seem like a powerful enough description for this book. The imagery the author uses takes over your thoughts and dreams. You feel as if you're entering the tents of the circus as you read... and in your mind hours after.<br /><br />All that said, don't wait. Buy and read this book now. You won't be disappointed. This isn't just hype!
B002NHIK1E|1.0|I bought these books years ago, found them in the back corner of a tiny little book shop. I loved those books so much I have read them until they fell apart and I had to buy new ones. When they put out this... travesty I was so disappointed. The chars are completely wrong, Elena is blond with blue eyes, she had a little sister, bonnie is a red head with curly hair. Meredith is the dark one with olive skin and Caroline has green eyes. Matt is close but Stefan's clothes are wrong. I know you can't do TV or movies just like a book, but if they had at least tried to get it close it would have been better. The books have such a depth of sorrow and love it draws you in. This is just some stupid producers way to make money and RUIN a perfectly good book.<br /><br />I would love to see these books done into a movie. With the same care and quality put into the twilight series. They aren't perfect but they are damn close enough for even me.<br /><br />I'm upset and disappointed in this show.
030746363X|4.0|I read this cover to cover and implemented a lot of the recommendations in my diet and fitness plan. The recommendations worked really well, but were difficult to continue for an extended amount of time. It's tough follow the guidelines and maintain a normal life with work, school, and family. Definitely worth reading though.

B0050QV0RQ|2.0|I got this for mine a few days ago when it was free. The game seems like fun but every 2-3 mins the thing would freeze and i would have to go back to the phone's home screen and then back to the game only to have the same thing happen over and over. Also this game seems to have been causing network issues in that it looked like i could not fully disconnect to the mobile network. UNINSTALLED, developer please fix all this.
0385344325|5.0|This book was so good it made my eyes water. Lee Child just gets better and better.   I could hardly put it down and forced myself to finish it in 4 sittings instead of 1. Only problem I had personally: I couldn't shake the fact that a leprechaun-sized actor was chosen to play Jack Reacher on the big screen.
B003OUXECE|4.0|For fans of the Rapture universe (as opposed to the Bioshock universe which is soon to include a new city, Columbia), this is a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable treat. This is my first video game novelization, due in no small part to the great writing already in both of the original Bioshock games. You should really be familiar with the games before reading though (at least the first one, but the second is good too, don't let anyone tell you otherwise).<br /><br />I say this because of the few minor quibbles I have with the novel.<br /><br />1) There is little in the way of suspense, as many of the plot developments are spelled out in advance and with little subtlety. This is not an issue because the fun of reading the book comes from the way all the pieces fit together, the way the author ties all these disparate threads together into a whole that makes you, \\"oh wow, that's how that came to be...\\" in tragic, convincing, and memorable ways.<br /><br />2) The passage of time is also not the authors strong suit. It's difficult to say how this could be done well, because I'm not an author. But again, it's not really an issue because, perhaps understanding the weakness, every single passage is dated with varying degrees of preciseness for clarity.<br /><br />3) Lastly, throughout the book, there are a few odd passages that just seem to be there to address random things from the game(s), but that don't support the story the book itself is telling on its own. Again, for fans of the games, it's just more detail we crave, but it makes the book itself even less of a standalone novel on its terms, and more of the companion piece that it is.<br /><br />I loved it, and was far more moved by it that I ever expected to be. If you finished the original Bioshock and felt like you had just experienced a great story, you owe it to yourself to read this.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|I was hooked on LOST from the beginning. Quality writing, compelling characters, riveting stories.  I love a show that makes you think, isn't lazy and can evoke emotion from you.  I appreciate not having my intelligence underestimated.  Unfortunately that's what started to happen in the final season.  Well, the show started to go downhill in like season 4 and 5, the plots were getting overly complex (there's a difference between smart and complex) It wasn't that they were difficult to follow but rather that they were starting to make no sense.  And characters that I loved kept getting killed off but I always thought, you know what? That's okay.  Because I always figured these deaths are going to matter.  For instance, Charlie dies to give them all a chance at rescue. And I thought, when they get rescued someone will tell Charlie's story and blah blah.  And then the dead characters started showing up and it was like cool, there must be something SO much bigger about the island that only the dead can comprehend, but that kind of amounted to nothing.  And little things kept popping up like Desmond and his copy of \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" the last book Charles Dickens ever wrote that Desmond said would be the last thing he ever read.  And it was like why would they even mention that if Desmond didn't have some clue when he would die? At this point he had already had psychic visions of the future and it was established that he was a link between multiple timelines/flashes/whatever. And there were a million other little similar things that made you think there was going to be some huge dramatic ending where  they all think they're going to die and Des reads his book.  But no.  From day one, you were made to believe that people like Lock who have a bad lot in life, are really meant for so much more.  He was meant to be on the island and he gave himself to it.  Then at the end he wasn't special at all and Ben talked him out of killing himself, strangled him to death and that was it.  Sayid, who I loved from the beginning, always trying to save everyone, blew up.  Sun and Gin drown together and none of this means anything.  But it's okay because we have these magical flash sideways which at first I hated because while I want them to be alive and happy, I don't want them to forget everything they went through on the island.  And I was getting so happy and excited when the true love (which made sense in every case but Jack, Juliet, Kate, Sawyer which should have been opposite) was making them remember so it was like the best of both worlds.  But that really didn't amount to anything either.  And don't even get me started on how they leave it with Ben.<br /><br /> Beyond all the loose ends not being tied up, and new questions being raised, there was simply bad writing.  The relationship between Sawyer and Juliet was one that made absolutely no sense at all and just there for convenience.  They were stuck together so they started a relationship.  And maybe they grew to love each other but that is not true love. You can't just go \\"oh, these characters are in love now\\" you actually have to do some writing, SHOW us why on earth they love each other because otherwise it doesn't make sense.  Jack and Juliet always made sense to me ever since they bonded when Jack was being held by Ben.  Kate and Sawyer were not written for each other but the chemistry was there and the writers went with it.  They should know when something is happening on it's own, that's a good thing, and they should roll with it.  But they fought it and forced it so that Kate and Jack would be together so it would mesh with the first episode. Never mind that Kate and Sawyer deeply understood each other because of their similar experiences.  While i was just fine with Kate and Jack, the show had already established multiple times that they just don't work together.  The writers just wanted an easy way out of the love triangle they created so they put people together that made no sense.  In my opinion, the great JJ Abrams got the series off to a fabulous start, then figured, \\"all right guys, you can handle it from here.\\"  But they couldn't handle it.  So they strung us along for years which apparently wasn't enough time for them to come up with any kind of satisfying ending. If you're going to start something monumental, you better have a mind blowing ending in mind.  You can't just feed us crap at the end, try to make it mystical and think we're all going to be happy.  In the end it felt like a cruel joke.<br /><br />In short, these last episodes were a far cry from \\"The Moth\\" or \\"Confidence Man\\" which nearly brought me to tears when i first saw them.  And I agree with another review on here that the last season makes you unable to enjoy the actual good episodes because now you know how disappointing the outcome of all their individual struggle and as a whole really is. Don't buy this season.  honestly, the ending you've imagined in your head is much better.y opinion, the great JJ Abrams got the series off to a fabulous start, then figured, \\"all right guys, you can handle it from here.\\"  But they couldn't handle it.

B004SIP7US|1.0|Usually a film has to have the word \\"Malibu\\" in the title to be this dumb. It wouldn't suck except for how much money and talent was squandered producing something that is neither history or entertainment. Everybody involved has done something great, go watch that instead.
1933492953|5.0|It's worth every penny and much more. Simply the best book on composition and lighting for visual story telling I've ever encountered. Not just for illustrators or concept artists but, anyone who's trying to convey a message through visual means would benefit from this work. It should be a standard work in any film school! Each page clearly discusses key concepts about effectively immersing your audience in the story and then demonstrates those concepts through beautifully crafted and inspiring illustrations. It will guide you into a more profound understanding of how to communicate with your art. Furthermore, it is clear that the author has a deeply pure understanding of his craft. He understands the important role the audience plays in \\"perceiving\\" the reality we attempt to create. Understanding that alone is worth the price of this book!  I found myself visualizing many new approaches and possibilities in my own work as I read. For me, as an artist, that's the highest compliment I can give to any work of art. I want to express my gratitude to the author for sharing his gift. Buy this book!
0743497465|2.0|Having read Dan Brown's \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" I was quite looking forward to this book but didn't expect too much. It starts off with great promise. The scene is set when a scientist is murdered and a meteor is dug out of ice 300 years old...<br /><br />Without doubt Brown is great at using punchy short paragraphs and shifts in scene on the same timeline to create a sense of tension. However, despite efforts to pad out the plot with the links to action in the White House, there was nothing new here. Alistair McLean and Ian Fleming would have felt on familiar ground with the classic emerging romance amid the action in the ice and bonus hidden traitor.<br /><br />I found the book both irritating and yet not putdownable. I realised this was because I was desperate for something non predictable to happen.<br /><br />Brown has come up with a formula for making best sellers and he stuck to it like glue.<br />I felt by the corny ending of the book that the only Deception in \\"Deception Point\\" had been the reviews that had got me to buy it.<br /><br />Oh, and I started to read \\"The Lost Symbol\\" but by page three had the strangest feeling of deja vu and stopped there. I will persevere...maybe I am wrong about it???
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I didn't think I'd like it because of the crude \\"dude\\" humor. But, die hard Sci-Fi and humor lover that I am, I gave it a shot. It was great; and the crude humor was a trope to get the earthlings to see how up-tight and alien they are in their own human skin. Humor aside, the makers of this movie boldly confronted the absurdity of fanatical Christiandom and its full scale attack against reason and the science. It's refreshing to see a mainstream confrontation of this nonsense when so many people are kowtowing and cowering in fear before the Far Right's loud-mouthed agenda. If you're a Sci-Fi fan, or every have been, you'll also get a kick out of the way this movie playfully spoofs Comic-Con types of events and those who attend!

B000002A46|5.0|About a decade ago I realized that collecting Christmas CDs was really a worthwhile investment.  More than all the other holiday decor and hoopla, nothing enriches that magical Christmas season more than classic Christmas music.  I now have close to 100 Christmas CDs.  These are all the classics, from Sinatra to Dino to Elvis to the Christmas soul and blues collections, etc.  In making my selections, I've relied heavily on the reviews the albums receive here on Amazon, and my fellow reviewers have done a great job of guiding me into some incredible Christmas music.  This album by Mariah Carey is one of the best Christmas albums, and I mean like possibly the VERY BEST of all, spanning six or seven decades and the world's greatest musicians, both famous and esoteric. Her voice is so powerful and passionate here that it truly captures the spirit of the season. Furthermore, this is Mariah Carey's best work, period.  My daughter has several of her award-winning albums and nothing else of hers even comes close to this.  This album is, simply stated, a Masterpiece.  If you are thinking of starting your own Christmas music collection, I'd suggest that you start right here.  This album will motivate you to keep adding to your collection.

0553801473|1.0|I wanted to love this book.  I tried to love this book.  I have bragged for years about Martin being my favorite author.  They say your creative years go bye bye after age 40.  Indeed most nobel prizes are earned before the age of 35 (won much later).  Martin is surely aging and it shows.  If it hadn't been for the first 3 awesome books, I would have stopped reading after 100 pages.  Thank the heavens the library took it back!<br />Nothing happened in the first 600 pages!  I literally kept waking up with the book in my lap.<br />The dwarf.  Just kill him already instead of continually changing his personality.  and I get it, everyone under the Dragon queen is hercules.  She's the most brilliant teenager in the galaxy.  That whole story line has become sopho-moronic.  I'd rather read Harry Potter for such juvenile treatment of the readers intellect.<br /><br />No more Martin, time to delve more into Pratchett.
0393327345|4.0|There's not much I can say about FIGHT CLUB that hasn't been said already (besides I'm not supposed to talk about it -first rule of FC and all) It's one of those books on everyone's \\"to read\\" list and ultimately it's everything you'd expect it to be; disjointed, astonishing, dark, gritty and fantastic. Although I did wonder how you'd manage to understand what's going on in the beginning chapters without having seen the movie first because they don't make a whole lot of sense.<br /><br />Of course you can't help but compare the book to the movie. And in saying that I was surprised to learn that Fight Club the movie followed the book faithfully (including dialogue). It is so similar in fact that the book now reads much like a screenplay adaptation, even though it came first. Movies rarely follow the book word for word and subsequently I didn't enjoy this as much as I'd been expecting to. There wasn't anything extra here, no added insight into Tyler Durden's character, no dirty scenes that didn`t make it into the movie. I just kept picturing Brad Pitt and Edward Norton (not a bad thing) but then I also pictured Meatloaf Big Bob and his huge man boobs.<br /><br />The ending however is completely different and it blew my mind. We see the unnamed narrator's split personality develop much earlier \\"I know this because Tyler knows this\\" It's not the zenith moment, just a symptom, and he (and we) become aware of it much earlier. We then get to watch \\"him\\" try to keep it together, to reign in his space monkeys, to get rid of Tyler by staying awake, to disband project mayhem \\"Tyler told us you'd say that\\" and his descent into madness is just brilliant.<br /><br />The afterwards by the author is also very interesting. Detailing how this all started as a 7 page story he wrote when he was bored at work one day (its included as chapter 6 in the book) and then of course he expanded, added some friends stories (the naughty waiters and film splicing) and wrote what has transformed into the cult classic it is today.<br /><br />Still, I think everyone should read this bookday.   Still, I think everyone should read this book

B004LWZVZC|1.0|Terrible treatment of fascinating story.  Simplistic, clearly made for an American audience.  If you want the a realistic and detailed treatment read \\"American Brutus.\\"  This film is cliche ridden.  For instance, in yard of fort, soldier noises:  \\"Left, right, left.\\"  And on and on.  This is hardly better than a made for TV movie.  Robert Redford is no Ken Burns.
014241543X|4.0|If I Stay is a perfect example of how a book can hijack your life.  Once I picked it up, I was hooked and read it in two days.  It was all I thought about.<br /><br />Mia and her family are in a terrible car accident, and as she lay comatose teetering between life and death, she remembers important snapshots of her life, and it's through these vignettes that readers truly learn who she is and what's important to her.  It's tissue worthy, but it's skillfully balanced so the book doesn't become a giant depressing sobfest.  Adam, Mia's boyfriend, compliments her perfectly; his guitar and rockstar swoon factor compliments her cello and classical demeanor.  Their relationship grows slowly and tenderly.  You can't help but fall in love with them...and it will own you.

1439152799|3.0|This is the first book I have read from this author.  The beginning chapters were very boring and several times I was tempted to put it down for good.  However, I pushed myself to continue.  In the middle it caught my attention and could not put it down.  However, the end was disappointing.  Not sure what I was expecting, but the ending was too sad.  Also, since it is my first book from this author, I am not sure if this is the way she typically writes.  There are some mysteries and unanswered questions, but the author lays them out for you so you know what happens - just not why.  In my opinion, by writing like this, there was no built up suspense for me.  I have not completely given up on this author.  I am planning to read The Forgotten Garden next.

0439023513|1.0|I was so excited for this book to come out. I preordered it months ago, and was counting down the days till it would arrive. But then, sadly, I really didn't like it. I can't say much without giving away some plot lines, but let's just say that I couldn't stand Katniss this time around, so it pretty much went downhill from there. Honestly, I wish I had never read it, so I could just make up my own ending to the story!

0316066524|1.0|ok, I feel as though someone completely cheated me out of a week's worth of my life. How in the WORLD has this book gotten so many good reviews? My only guess is that people who give it five stars are in fact giving themselves the high rating as a result of being able to read the whole thing! So many times I wanted to stop, but as always, once I start a book I have to see it through to the bitter end. Only this one didn't even have a real ending. It's like it just stopped at a completely random point, as though the author was tired of writing and just said, \\"Ok, it's done.\\"   There are so many things wrong with this book. I don't mind reading a book that requires me to have a dictionary in one hand... honestly I enjoy improving my vocablulary. But this one was ridiculous. But that isn't my main complaint. The big problem, as I see it, is that the many, many parts of the story never fit cohesively together at all. There are at least 34 main characters, not including Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents. I kept thinking that at some point they would all be drawn together into the plot, but alas, it was not meant to be. At around page 400 it looked hopeful, by page 800 it was less so but I was still thinking \\"This has to get better\\", but it never did. And, really, over a hundred pages worth of footnotes? I stopped reading them halfway through the book because they were so pointless.   Trust me, don't waste your time with this one. And don't believe all the hype. Yes, David Foster Wallace was obviously a genius, and yes, it's sad that he killed himself, but that doesn't excuse this poor excuse for a novel. Oh one other thing that drove me crazy: he started so many sentences with \\"And but so..\\" or \\"So but and...\\" What is that???
B005GSY23M|5.0|This film just blew me away, the Tree of Life can go suck it, Drive is the movie everyone should be talking about this year! The cinematography, direction, and score just make this quite possibly one of the best LA films since Heat (A Los Angeles Crime Saga).   The musical tracks are perfect and set the mood to the point. The score (while I did find it a bit overused in the film) is spectacular! Reminiscent of Aphex Twin, the ambiance it sets matches perfectly with each scene and is presented beautifully.
B00536OCZA|1.0|If you give a damn about sound quality, DO NOT buy this vinyl.  EMI has done an insulting job of transferring what could arguably be called \\"the greatest album ever recorded\\" onto the vinyl medium.  Now I'm not an audiophile whack job with a $15k turntable and pure gold speaker cables.  But even I can tell the difference between what sounds like someone eating a mouthful of pop rocks with their mouth open [this album,] and quality quiet vinyl.  This vinyl is incredibly noisy, and I was surprised by the quantity of surface defects that spanned multiple grooves, resulting in recurring \\"shchh\\" noise with every rotation of the record for up to a minute at a time [including at the beginning of The Great Gig in the Sky, of all places!]  I was planning on purchasing EMIs new releases of Wish You Were Here and The Wall on vinyl too, but not any more.  I love Dark Side of the Moon and have it in several formats already.  If you love this album too, do not purchase this version.  Instead, seek out a used copy of Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's vinyl pressing from 1979.  My 32-year-old MFSL copy puts this new edition to shame.
B000AP04MO|2.0|My wife and I barely got through this film.  We found it dated, disjointed and not particularly cute.  Audrey Hepburn is always beautiful -- even when covered with dirt.  The locations were lovely.  The DVD quality was fine.  We found the multiple time shifts a bit too disjointing without adequate anchoring.  The dialogue also seemed dated and the trick of speeding up the camera to \\"comic\\" silent movie speeds was cute once, but got \\"old\\" when repeated several times.  Not a film for the ages.

0553801503|5.0|People have been constantly throwing a fit over the fact that this book doesn't follow their main characters that they know and love, but it is not fair to decimate the book because of that. George R. R. Martin is gonig to write the series the way that he intends and it's not anyone elses buisness to say otherwise. The book is literally fantastic and if you are a true Ice and Fire fan you'll delve into this book just for the knowledge that it will bring you about the other characters in the series. I've always found it wonderful to see a different characters view much like Theon in Clash, it creates the alterior motives that you did not know was going on behind the scenes in previous books. The sub plot in cersei's scheming storywas a little out of left field for me and may add more to the next set of books but for the moment it kind of left a little wanting for me. But on further information I found that Samwell and Brienne's Story lines were fantastic and I truly couldn't wait to reach what their next plot points were. Same goes for the Kingslayer, I am absolutely entertained with how these characters are evolving in an entirely fictional world. I can't wait to get done with ADWD just to get more information. Hopefully the wait for Wind Of Winter will not be too long!

B004G25V9S|5.0|OPETH \\"HERITAGE\\" (review in English)<br />by Helen Liverakou on Monday, 05 September 2011<br /><br />OPETH \\"HERITAGE\\"<br /><br />And here comes the moment that most metal fans awaited for so long. \\"Heritage\\", the 10to studio album by OPETH, after 3 long years, arrives to become the Apple of Discord in the music industry. Some days before you could feel the tension in the air, disagreements and even fights for what was to come, how the album would be and if they would assemble the \\"good old Opeth\\" and so they came to be part of the same list as Anathema, Paradise Lost, Pain of Salvation, with the fans being divided, making the waiting even more tense. The hunt for music evolution, innovation and progress seems like an adventure. The agony of waiting for the success or failure of an album, of making a difference, leaves you a panting till the very moment you push \\"play\\".<br /><br />Now the time has arrived and Mikael Åkerfeldt made his repressed thoughts reality, ignoring everyone's opinion. It was something that he dreamed of doing since he was 20 years old and he did it. In  \\"Heritage\\", Åkerfeldt frees all his music legacy from his past years. I should make clear that I am not going to make the mistake of comparing this album with any of their past work, there is absolutely no relationship at all. First of all, we have to deal with an album that some might rush to say that is the continuation of \\"Damnation\\". It is a pure progressive metal album, as in the 70s' great bands of the genre. Slightly dark at some points but without being depressing or pessimistic.It has intense moments, quite hard sometimes, yet quite beautiful also. It is certainly something else, different from the traditional Opeth. Even though Åkerfeldt loves analog recordings  situations, here we have 5.1 mix and the intervention of his friend Steven Wilson, making you admire his production for yet another time. The 10 great songs reside in the cd beneath the peculiar artwork of the unique in his profession Travis Smith (see Riverside, Winds, Katatonia, November's Doom,...).<br /><br />In \\"Heritage\\", lasting about an hour, you won't experience even a glimpse of hard vocals or death metal notes and you will feel what great influences King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Cream have been to Åkerfeldt career; it is like he had made a deal with his obsessions to make them come true. He states though, that they are not interested in the opinions of others and that if their death metal fans can't take this, it is their own problem (if something sticks to your mind..!). Starting with a wonderful intro, the homonymous \\"Heritage\\", full of piano notes, makes the way for \\"The Devil's Orchard\\", which also tends to become the single, even if it's not their high point of the album, but it's just the one that is most \\"Opeth\\"! Following is \\"I Feel The Dark\\", which makes you feel its gravity, atmospheric, classical guitar, outbreaks, space point and rich Hammond dose. \\"Slither\\" comes indeed to make a surprise, very fast, a dedication to the unreachable DIO let's say, a pure 70s' progressive piece with clear influences from Deep Purple and Rainbow, adjusted to Opeth standards. Full experimentation, atmospheric slide guitars, a smell of jamming at some points; \\"Nepenthe\\" is almost acoustic. \\"Haxprocess\\" has also well played guitars and pretty vocals, distant nostalgic sounds. It could very easily be a classical guitar lesson. After that come a strange song which makes you believe for a moment that you are in the jungle. All that happens during \\"Femine\\". Weird sounds that leave you a sense of agony and adventure, oriental rhythms for about one minute. Then it changes again and gets sweeter with piano and flutes. \\"The Lines In My Hands\\" is by my opinion the best song of the album. The keyboards are amazing, the guitarist's technique is great and the bass truly takes this song to the next level! The second longest song of the album fits in a single title, \\"Folklore\\". The title alone lets you know what you are about to hear. It will surely become a source of inspiration for many new ambitious guitarists. The outro is as great as the intro. \\"Marrow Of The Earth\\", a pure guitar song, with a touch of keyboards near the end, leaves you great grief and longing, but without darkening you mood.<br /><br />The dream of M.  Åkerfeldt has eventually come true in this album, but and I cannot help thinking that the other members of the band just... followed. A truly great album, with intense experimentation but without wearing you out. When it is over, you wonder, was that all? For me it is of the year's best. Just enjoy it, without hesitation.<br /><br />\\"Led the blind, Searched to find, A pathway to the sun, Saw the signs, Intertwined..\\"/The Devil's Orchard<br /><br />HELEN LIVERAKOUwill surely become a source of inspiration for many new ambitious guitarists.

The only others I knew are Hold The Line and Rosanna, these are good as far as they go, however most of the rest are not distinctive enough to take my full interest.  Having said that Out Of Love and I Won't Hold You Back are ballards in the 1980s Chicago mould, so no complaints there.  Overall not the best 1980s rock to be found, I prefer Boston, Joe English Band, Dire Straits, Kansas and Asia.

There's a view that the the world has about a place, they have never stayed in or even visited.  2. People like it if someone tells them that their view is accurate.  3. Sell them that and you are a bestseller!

All the songs are the real-deal blues, and the other artists he's working with are amazing.  If you can catch the PBS \\"Great Performances\\" with Laurie, too, do it!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|If you were expecting an action flick filled with epic fight scenes, you may find yourself a bit disappointed or wanting more. That said, this movie was spectacular. Humor and tension are well-balance throughout the movie, keeping it from becoming dark or despite, and letting the quirky characters of the family shine. The art was, of course, beautiful. And the overall plot of the virus worked well with the underlying message about family.
B0058WFO06|5.0|I wasn't expecting a Porcupine Tree album and this one isn't. Instead in its own way it is just as good if not better. It's darker, moodier, toned down and personal. Sure there are PT elements at work here (especially on \\"Remainder The  Black Dog\\" and the 23 minute epic \\"Raider II\\" which is worth the price of admission alone). Instead much of this is like a tribute to classic English prog as I hear Pink Floyd, Caravan and King Crimson among others. Steven Wilson has to be the best composer and musician in the rock genre today. A tour de force!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I was so excited when I recieved the movie only 2 days after being told it had been shipped, and 2 days before it was estimated to get here. Insert dorky happy dance. I of course watched the movie right away and was completely stunned by the special effects. The other two movies had pretty awesome FX, but this movie topped them both. And there was just enough humor mixed in with all the action, I love how Bay makes it so you're one minute you're freaking out thinking a main characters going to die, and then the next you're laughing like crazy. Shia Labeouf contributed to that a lot, he's hilarious.   The only thing I had a problem movie-wise was a couple of new characters I didn't recognize. I don't know how many people are familiar with the original cartoon, or any of the others they made after that, but I'll admit that I am and I haven't heard of Que or Dino and some of the others before. Not that I didn't like the characters, I just don't understand why they had to make some of them up when they literally have probably hundreds of originals to choose from (And they had Sideswipe but no Sunstreaker, how weird is that?).   About the actual DVD though, I was disappointed in the lack of bonus features. I guess they're now charging us extra for that, too. Amazon needs to put in their product description that there are none on this DVD, so customers know ahead of time instead of popping the disc into their DVD player and being disappointed.  All in all, awesome movie, excellent shipping, not too bad a price either. I'm happy with my purchase:)
0575085096|5.0|I still find it hard to believe whenever I meet fantasy readers who have never read any Terry Pratchett books. The Colour of Magic, the first of the Discworld series, like all other of the Discworld books, is a wonderfully humorous parody of, well, everything. Much like Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide series, the story itself is secondary to the writing. Pratchett's insightful view on life, the unusual inventive ways that he uses to describe the setting, characters and action, the way he turns a comic phrase--all these things make the reader pore over every page, looking for gems he or she may have missed. The art, in this case in the journey, not the destination. If you want to know what these books are like, don't read reviews. You're missing out. Read the books.

I have tried slicing chicken lengthwise but pounding it is way better. it cooks evenly and comes out juicier. Brilliant.
0060012358|5.0|This was the first Terry Pratchett book I have read that seemed to be aimed at a younger audience, though by no means do you need to be a kid to enjoy it. Although loosely a Discworld book, it is really a parody of the Pied Piper in which the piper and the rats are joined with a very cunning cat to scam the population. As with all of Pratchett's books, his wonderful sense of humor and ability to uniquely turn a phrase make this story a joy to read.
B0058VW36U|5.0|downloaded. played. enjoyed. This game helped me through a strangely insomniatic night. I was worried that the levels would just get harder and harder until they are essentially unplayable and frustrating.  but that didn't happen. the higher levels introduce new challenges and obstacles but the game is really fun and playable. some levels I am perfectly happy to take my 1 star and not look back. others are compelling enough to make me want to play over and over until I get 3 stars. and its oddly rewarding to see the happy, satisfied little frog face when he eats his candy. good game.

0439023521|3.0|I honestly have been growing to hate this book. I read it in pretty much one sitting and I loved it all the way until part three. After that point the book drags for about a hundred pages as the characters change completely, the tone of the book changes, and nothing happens except that large sections are drown out with the promise of a twist at the end; only there isn't one. This book reminds me of the Westmark series by LLoyd Alexander, the first book is great, but the second two focus on the worst part of the first. That is what the third section of this book i;, more than a hundred pages of the worst parts of the previous sections of the book. Having read the descriptions of the second and, out of curiosity, the third I can say for certain that after the book changes tone the series is never the same. If you want a good read I suggest you pick this up, read to the second to last page of part two, and then just make up your own ending, otherwise you'll be greatly disappointed.<br /><br />If you want a book about a post-apocalyptic North America why not check out Zenu - By Peter L. Kenna, I can't promise its any better written or has fewer typos, but I can promise it will be more consistent in characters and pacing, for the most part. Also, no ones reading it and it makes me sad. Just check out the preview at least, it'll make me feel better.[[ASIN:1449599125 Zenu]]

0671027573|1.0|I am a big Linda Howard fan and own many of her books, but this one was a huge disappointment.  Like another of the posters, I could not even finish it.  The premise, a bunch of friends creating a list of the characteristics of a \\"perfect man\\" while having a rollicking good time over drinks, is somewhat clever, but Ms. Howard simply could not make the remainder of the book work for me.  The unintended consequences of this casual, mindless fun were far too disproportionate, and just made my stomach churn.  I realize that this was precisely the point, but I just couldn't read much past the first murder.    Nor could I work up any interest in the hero and heroine - they seemed like pale, less-likable imitations of Blair Mallory and Wyatt Bloodsworth (from \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\" and \\"To Die For\\", two of Linda Howard's best novels IMHO). I want more romance and a lot less horror in a romance novel.
1594202710|4.0|Dr. Kissinger's latest book On China is described by Penguin as a \\"sweeping and insightful history,\\" which it certainly is.  However, it clearly intends to also be an analysis of the relationship of the United States and a rapidly developing superpower starting where Dr. Kissinger entered the history personally and then projected into the future coexistence of these two nations.  On this level I was immediately struck by its comparison with [[ASIN:0195373197 China: Fragile Superpower]] by Susan Shirk.  Kissinger makes reference as did Shirk to the game GO analogy in Chinese thinking, to comparison with Otto von Bismarck's development of a \\"rising\\" Germany, and to a win-win rather than zero sum outcome for the relationship, and there are other similarities.  Certainly, Kissinger's view is much longer as Shirk's analytical piece picks up long after the Korean War.  But it is in comparing the books that I find Kissinger's treatment much less detailed and far more respectful of the relationships he has with Chinese leaders-as though he plans yet another visit and wants a still friendly welcome.<br /><br />Susan Shirk's central theme is that the Communist Party rulers of China view almost all domestic and international issues from a single viewpoint-the preservation of their rule.  She dwells far more on issues that will always divide the peoples of China and the USA like religious suppression, lack of workers' rights, forced abortions, control of Tibet, Internet/media censorship, jailing and killing dissidents (Tiananmen), pirating of intellectual property, and unfair competition for jobs and currency supremacy.  Both Shirk and Kissinger realize the necessity of having a way to deal with transient crises like the bombing of the Chinese embassy, the collision of our plane with theirs in the strait, WTO admission, the attempted purchase of UNOCAL, Japanese premiers' visits to war memorials, as well as longstanding problems like North Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, Taiwan, and Taiwan.  These countries must understand each other if they wish to navigate such roiled seas.  Kissinger tries to take this understanding into the deeply philosophical realm, which is why he rehearses the entire history of China and describes its recent leaders as polished, eminent statesmen.  Shirk has the more realistic and pragmatic approach.  She mentions Sun Tzu only once and Confucius never.<br /><br />The many reviews here make it unnecessary to summarize Dr. Kissinger's book.  It is an impressive effort that all Americans should read.  However, it reminded me immediately of another book from 2007 by a US State Department member, who also visited and dealt with the Chinese on many occasions, that might be a better guide for relating to China's \\"peaceful rise.\\"  Perhaps Susan Shirk's work [[ASIN:0195373197 China: Fragile Superpower]] deserves another look to provide a more balanced view than Kissinger's of the leadership we face in China.<br /><br />(Both books have only one map up front, Kissinger's more detailed, Shirk's more analytical.  Kissinger has a central collection of of illustrations that are glossy images of leaders' visits right up to Obama.  Shirk has interspersed photos directly illustrative of the points of narrative.)hese countries must understand each other if they wish to navigate such roiled seas.

0345528581|5.0|This book is simply great in my opinion! Very easy to read, very informative and sure an eye-opener! I'm a certified personal trainer and looking to get my own business up and running, offering training at home, in the park, office or wherever a customer wants to train. I'm not a gym-person myself (too much hassle, to expensive and a waste of time!) but have been into sports and fitness all my life. This book is just what I needed at this point, for myself as well as for my business and clients! 125 exercises plus countless variations is absolutely unbeatable, all very well explained and described. The author doesn't promise too much, he gives you all the info you need and what you do with it is up to you, your goals and your commitment. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get in better shape, get fitter or simply feel better. The only missing thing is that the warm up or stretching is not really a topic in this book, but still is kind of common sense to mebig deal. Overall, if you want to get in great shape at home, buy this book, and for only 10 bucks you really can't beat it!

1593080719|4.0|This was a ground breaking work at the time and is still sadly relevant today in it's depiction of the false values of 'Vanity Fair' ie society. Innocents such as poor Amelia Sedley, the failing merchant's daughter who worships her caddish officer fiance and later husband, George Osborne, are marked out as victims in this world of predators, hypocrits and false idols.   Only people such as Becky Sharp,a bohemian artist's daughter who is determined to advance herself, even at the cost of compromising her reputation with the debauched old Marquis of Steyne, can hold their own in a world of such false values.  While this is called 'a novel without a hero' in fact there is one, of sorts, in the honourable and brave, if clumsy and often ineffectual, Dobbin, who worships both Amelia and George.  Set during the Napoleonic Wars, this is a wide ranging and massive book. I would be dishonest if I didn't admit there are long and often dull digressions, but there are often flashes of brilliance, too.   For instance, this hauntingly evocative description of the battle action at the end of chapter thirty two:-  **Spoiler follows**.   '...Then at last, the English troops rushed from the post for which no enemy had been able to dislodge them, and the Guard turned and fled. No more firing was heard at Brussels - the pursuit rolled miles away. Darkness came down on the field and the cit y; and Amelia was praying for George, who was lying on his face, dead, with a bullet through his heart.'  In fact, I think the novel is too hard on poor George, whose memory Amelia so worships. For sure, his motives are depicted as often inadmirable, but after all, he does sacrifice his chances of a fortune in marrying Amelia, urged on by Dobbin or  not. When Becky finally disillusions poor Amelia, she knows only part of the story but speaks with typical authoritativeness. We know more; we have seen George's remorse on the eve of the battle as he writes his last leter because in his foolish infatuation with Becky he has sent her a note asking her to go away with him. Then, he wishes 'the night's work undone' and bitterly regrets his squandeirng his small inheritence and his neglect of Amelia. But Becky doens't know this, and Amelia never seems to find it out...I found this very sad. I have read that Thackeray based Georges to some extent on a friend of whom he was jealous, coveting his wife; and the harshness with which he treats George does seem to point to some such emotional confusion.     Most people are put off this story by the length, but I have to admit to having read it several times myself (! Geek, or what?) Thackeray is often dryly cynical, yet given also to fits of sentimentality; he was perhaps far less the cynic than he might at first seem.  There are flashes of brilliance in it, and bad writing too. There are interesting insights - particularly into the oppression of women.  It is unfortunate that the proprieties of the time forbid Thackeray from making explicit sexual themes in the story. For instance, does Becky have an adulterous relationship with the awful Marquis? Her far more attractive husband Rawdon Crawley certainly believes so to wish to call him out.   Then, does Amelia find Dobbin physically attractive at the end (or does Thackeray refuse to believe that a virtuous woman has such feelings)? We have no way of knowing if she becomes reconciled to his huge feet, clumsiness and the other features she once found so unappealing.  In Vanity Fair the wicked, like Becky Sharp flourish; decent, honourable people fall by the wayside and nobody looks back. Many feminists find Becky sympathetic; not me, but she makes for an intriguing read.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|It's Kind of a Funny Story, based on Ned Vezzini's novel, is a black comedy that surprisingly keeps you entertained, Zach Galifianakis, keeps you wanting more. Mental illness is certainly not a comical thing but people portraying it is. The movie is mainly shot in a mental hospital ward that host an array of characters. When an over stressed sixteen year old, Craig (Kier Gielchrist), feels that he can't cope anymore; he freely checks himself into a mental hospital for depression. He meets Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a depressed patient (that is hilarious), is the \\"go- to guy\\" for the psych ward. He befriends Craig and surprisingly help one another. Noelle (Emma Roberts), plays a depressed teen, who Craig sees a love interest in, and blossoms into a unique relationship. Craig, may be depressed and somewhat suicidal but when he arrives at the hospital and realizes everyone really is \\"crazy\\" and  his problems are really not big anymore. Reluctant to stay, now forced to be committed for a five day stay, Craig works through his feelings with the help staff psychiatrist, Dr. Minerva (Viola Davis). Once, the un- cool kid in school, is a now \\"Cool Craig.\\" Craig, realizes his life is really worth living for.   Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, Sugar), It's Kind of a Funny Story, gives plenty of animation, retrospect and music as audio components. Boden and Fleck, do a superb job coinciding the music with animation. One scene, when Craig is the vocals on music night. He \\"rocks- out\\" Davie Bowie's Under Pressure.  It's kind of a Funny Story, is a whimsical, light- hearted story, that combines humor and seriousness into a unique story.

OK I realize he can do anything he wants to do but this is not the direction to take.  It is almost comical.  I remember Eric talking about Muddy Waters when he went to see him with his family and Muddy was riding a tricycle and falling over looking silly and thinking: how it looked to Eric seeing his hero look so stupid.  This is the same thing.  Its stupid and embarassing. I wish it would stop.  I say this with a tear in my eye.
B004RC8NUQ|2.0|Such a shame that talented actors like these are wasted on movies like this one.  I love both Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher in other roles.  But this movie did not flow well at all.  Very juvenile.  There was really no substance to Portman and Kutcher's relationship, even after they decided to be exclusive, it was like, what did I miss?  The scene with the 3 women moping around the house, pigging out on sweets, hanging around in pj's, and generally seeming miserable, only reinforces the stereotype that a woman's menstrual cycle is a time when she is non-functioning and feels miserable, which is far from the truth.  Women can basically do anything we normally do during this week and be happy about it.  Loved Kevin Kline (who, unfortunately, had only a few short scenes).  It did give a fairly accurate portrait of the sad way that young ppl interact these days, thru texting and sexing.  It is a good movie for cultural study, perhaps, but not definitely not for entertainment or to teach values.  I can imagine young kids watching this and thinking it is ok to subsitute sex for real relationships.

Maybe it is my age (close to 50) ... but an action movie like this does not feel right with some Techno-Dance THUMP THUMP Bass music that sounds like it belongs in a South Beach night club.<br /><br />c) It really is pretty dull and boring with most of the story being Hannah traveling on the road with a bunch of gypsy-like people ....... sadly this makes 75% of the movie feel like filler.<br /><br />It's a bit quirky and has a little of that weird \\"euro-artsy-fartsy\\" feel to it that unfortunately serves to prevent the movie being as intense as it could be.<br /><br />It comes across kind of campy.<br /><br />Actually as I write this review and revisit the movie in my head, I like it less and less, so maybe I had better end this review before I change my mind and make it only 2 stars.

B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I purchased this while looking around the Kindle bookstore.  I thought it seemed intriguing.  No spoilers:<br /><br />First, the good stuff:<br /><br />It is a very good idea for the story.  Just about anyone can feel some kinship with the protagonist, and who doesn't remember the magical time in childhood when reality and fantasy were blurred at the edges?  Who also doesn't remember how, over time, that blurred line became more and more concrete?  This novel plays on that well, and I found it nostalgic and invigorating.<br /><br />The novel is well-written.  It is a fairly quick read.<br /><br />Now, the bad stuff:<br /><br />I have two main criticism that impact my rating the strongest.  If this book is highly recommended by a friend, or looks amazing to you, I wouldn't let them deter you.  If you're unsure about it, then read on!<br /><br />As others point out, the Kindle version renders the photographs and \\"hand written notes\\" such that they cannot be zoomed.  For the photos, it is disappointing but doesn't hurt the story - each photograph is described in detail in the text.  However, there are a couple of notes, written/found by characters, that are integral to the story.  The content of these are NOT described in the text.  One, for me, was totally illegible; another, I could make out a few words.  I found this to be egregious; yes, I could make out what they said from the context of the story, but it was disappointing to say the least.  The photos is acceptable, though to be frank being able to see them adequately would have enhanced the experience.<br /><br />My other criticism is that the story seems hastily ended, most likely in an effort to establish a sequel.  When one is dealing with a Story of Epic Proportions, such interruptions are expected and allowed.  When dealing with a Discrete Set of Characters Tied Together with a Story or World Arc, this is not.  I liken it to Lord of the Rings or Wheel of Time versus Harry Potter or the Alex Delaware novels.  The treatment here is the latter trying to behave like the former.  Frankly, it doesn't work.  In fact, I more disinclined to pick up another story in this series (if there is one) because of this fact.<br /><br />To summarize: if this looks insanely interesting or was recommended by a friend who knows you well, pick it up - in the physical, not digital version.  You probably won't be disappointed (at least, not too much).  If you're unsure, you can probably pass this one by.Frankly, it doesn't work.

B004ZN9RWK|4.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 SINGLE-DISC VERSION ***<br /><br />I've reviewed the 2011 remasters of Pink Floyd's \\"Meddle\\" (1971), \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" (1972) and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" (1975) - all three are sonically amazing but hugely disappointing on the packaging front (miniscule booklets that exclude original details and don't expand your knowledge a jot). It's pretty much an identical story here. But let's get to the details first...<br /><br />The vinyl LP \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\" was originally released 10 March 1973 on Harvest SMAS-11163 in the USA and 24 March 1973 in the UK on Harvest Records SHVL 804. This 26 September 2011 single-disc version (released 27 Sep 2011 in the USA) on EMI 50999 028955 2 9 is a straightforward 10-track remaster of that Number 1 studio album. A 2CD 'Experience' Edition and a 6-Disc 'Immersion' Box Set are also released Monday 26 September 2011 (see separate entries for details). This single-disc 'Discovery' reissue comes in a gatefold card sleeve with a newly laid-out 12-page inlay inside (total playing time 42:59 minutes).<br />[Note: original copies of the vinyl LP famously came with 2 posters, 2 stickers and a titled 'Pink Floyd The Dark Side Of The Moon' sticker on the front - this new issue doesn't feature any of these original items, but instead simply uses the now familiar untitled 'prism' artwork]<br /><br />Like all the other albums in this 14-title reissue series - \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\" has been mastered by JAMES GUTHRIE and JOEL PLANTE at the Das Boot Recording Studios in Tahoe in California (Guthrie is a Sound Engineer associated with the band since 1978). The original 1st generation master tapes have obviously been given a thorough going over because it truly feels like each segment has had a staggering amount of time spent on them - worrying out every single nuance possible. The audio result is truly impressive.<br /><br />God knows how many times this 'cash cow' of an album has been reissued on CD - and yet another version will probably make even the most die-hard of fans yawn and even feel a little angry. But - outside of the amazing SACD version of 2003 - this new 2011 'Discovery' edition is absolutely the best it's ever going to be for those of us with a lesser budget. The now famous opening heart-beat and 'loony' voices of \\"Speak To Me\\" sound extraordinary - which in turn lead into the sonic wall of \\"Breathe (In The Air)\\" - and it's a WOW. The remaster hasn't dampened anything or over-amplified it for the sake of volume (the dreaded loudness wars so many talk of) - it's just 'there' - all the instruments present and swirling around your speakers in superlative clarity. And while \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\" and the lovely \\"Us And Them\\" were always going to be audio wonderland with their myriad effects and top-drawer Alan Parsons production values - it's the last track on Side 1 that impresses the most. The truly gorgeous and innovative \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\" is on the 'Immersion' mega box set in its original bare-bones state - later beefed up with the incredible Acapella Vocal of CLARE TORRY - and what a smart move that was. Even in its very quiet opening and ending passages - it sounds BEAUTIFUL - and not for the first time brought a tear to a weary eye. I also love the \\"Any Colour You Like\\" instrumental on Side 2 (some DJs have been mixing it in with Dance and Funk 12\\" in their sets) and by the time \\"Eclipse\\" finishes this concept of concept albums (lyrics above) - it's very hard not to be impressed at the work Guthrie and Plante have done here.<br /><br />I wish I could say the same for the staggeringly unimaginative packaging. The 'Pink Floyd' logo you see in all the photos advertising these new reissues turns out to be a sticker on the outer shrink-wrap that gets lost the second you unpeel it. The card sleeves are like The Beatles 09/09/09 EMI reissues - glossy and flimsy - so they smudge with finger prints the second you open them and are easy to bend and crease.The CD itself has the new generic artwork (the sticker design on the outer packaging) repeated in different colour variations throughout the series - a sort of Turquoise and Pale Green for \\"Meddle\\", a garish Red and Pink for \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", Blue and Green for \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and here - Black And Grey for \\"Dark Side...\\" But where's the beautiful band poster, the two Hipgnosis-designed stickers, the deep blue triangle/prism Harvest label of the English LP? This ludicrous new design has no relevance to the original and speaking of the disc itself - there's no protective gauze sleeve for the CD either so it will scuff on repeated plays. The inner glossy gatefold could easily have featured these - instead we get two useless sepia-tinted pictures of the pyramids - how imaginative...<br /><br />But the skimpy booklet is the biggest disappointment. It has the lyrics of the original album (which were on the inner gatefold) reset in the new booklet against a background of god-awful Storm Thorgerson images. Of the millions of words written about this most famous of rock records, there isn't even a history on the album. There's no pictures of European and Worldwide 7\\" sleeves for \\"Money\\" and \\"Time\\" (singles lifted off the album), no pictures of the band, no 7\\" edit versions etc - naught to get your teeth into. OK - it does look nice and does the job adequately - but that's all. It's a lazy-assed approach on behalf of EMI and undermines the sterling work done on the sound front. I hate to come across like some nick-picking fan boy here, but it would have been nice to actually 'discover' something on this so-called 'Discovery' version (docked a star for that).<br /><br />To sum up - the remaster is gobsmacking - a stone five stars - but sadly we get mediocre presentation that completely undermines the original power of the album when you got it in your hands all those decades ago. Still - with an opening salvo price of less than a tenner in most stores - and the truly beautiful sonic upgrade thrown in - the casual listener is advised to dig in, rediscover and enjoy.<br /><br />Die-hard fans however might want to wait for the Japanese Editions that will inevitably arrive in 2012 on the far superior SHM-CD format (a better make of CD playable on all players). With their faithfully reproduced artwork and audiophile reproduction - they may give your bank manager a cold sweat - but they will absolutely be the ones to get if the best is all you'll accept.<br /><br />Despite my gripes about presentation - \\"Meddle\\", \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" and the wonderful \\"Wish You Were Here\\" should be your next port of call. I suspect many music lovers will feel exactly the same...<br /><br />PS: fans of memorabilia should note that for this launch - HMV London is giving away a titled banded-envelope containing 6 colour postcards in the same style as the one in the original \\"Wish You Were Here\\" LP (girl diving into a lake) for customers who purchase 2 titles in this reissue campaign.

0385344325|5.0|I am listening to the audiobook of \\"The Affair\\" and I LOVE IT!!!. I LOVE how Mr. Child's incorporates other characters from the present and presents them in the past, like, Frances Neagley and General Garber.  THAT IS BRILLIANT!!!.  The WHOLE STORY IS BELIEVABLE and it makes sense, as to how Jack Reacher comes into Margrave.  This prequel is better than the Star Wars prequel movies.  TOM CRUISE WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER be \\"Jack Reacher\\" in the \\"One Shot\\" movie and I, for one, will NOT BE GOING TO SEE IT, WHEN IT COMES OUT!!!.  TOM CRUISE COULD NEVER BE \\"Jack Reacher\\" and it REALLY DISAPPOINTS ME that they are letting him play that character.  THE MOVIE WILL BE A BOMB!!!....MARK MY WORDS!!!.  If I could give \\"The Affair\\" 10 STARS, I WOULD!!!...IT IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK, TO LISTEN TO AND TO READ!!!.  I owned the book on Kindle and to me, that is a good price to pay on it.  THANK YOU MR. CHILDS FOR CREATING A EXCELLENT CHARACTER!!!.  I can't wait to see what is next for him.  Maybe an illegimate child that he never knew he had?
1932100660|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this book.  When a second friend told me about this book, I had to get it.  Parts of it are difficult to get through (I feel like an undergrad again.) The message is clear, we are what we eat! I have incorporated more salads and organic food into my diet.  It is difficult to let go of meat entirely, but I'm starting to phase it out to once a week and increase fish products into my diet.  The information is startling.  When I am done reading this book, I intend to read it again, for continued clarification and I indeed have already passed the title around to family and friends.  Great book, get it now!!!

0780626966|5.0|A Nightmare on Elm Street  1984 / 91 min. / Rated R.  By the time Freddy Krueger stormed theaters, Jason was dead (albeit, not for very long), and Michael Myers lay dormant (only to be resurrected again in 1988), and the horror community was ready to embrace a new icon. \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" not only gave birth to Freddy Krueger, but to New Line Cinema, as well. This was the beginning of a new era. Much of the praise belongs to that of writer/director Wes Craven for creating the nightmare world that Freddy would stalk. The premise is truly ingenious, as it centers on a group of teenagers - led by Heather Lankenkamp, who plays Nancy Thompson - that is being terrorized by a terribly burned child killer that haunts them in their dreams, killing them with a homemade, razor-sharp glove. Robert Englund deserves an avalanche of kudos for bringing the \\"Springwood Slasher\\" to life in such a memorable and iconic fashion. There is so much that is done right with this low budget chiller that it would cast a very large shadow for any Freddy film to stad toe-to-toe with it. From the make-up effect to its musical score to that little school yard jingle, the film just works. While the acting from the various cast members may be a bit spotty at times, `Nightmare' truly succeeds in delivering on atmosphere and suspense. It's genuinely creepy, and like all classics, it should not be missed.   A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge  1985 / 87 min. / Rated R.  The trouble with this sequel truly began as soon as New Line Cinema decided against re-teaming with the creator, Wes Craven. Instead they opted for debut screenwriter David Chaskin and \\"Alone in the Dark\\" director, Jack Sholder. This one picks up five years after the events of the first film with a teenage boy moving into the house Nancy occupied in Part 1. Undoubtedly, this is the most controversial film of the franchise, and for good reason. Among many complaints, `Freddy's Revenge' is often cited as being a homoerotic horror film. As stated in Seinfeld, \\"not there's anything wrong with that,\\" but when horror films of this kind generally aim to appeal to teenage boys, this is not the type of horror they'd be looking for. That aside, how is the film itself? Well, beyond showing off some nifty effects and the fact the film keeps a very dark tone throughout, there's really nothing much else good to say about it. As a curiosity piece, it's certainly worth viewing, but don't expect much more than that.  A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors  1987 / 96 min. / Rated R.  This is really where the Freddy Krueger craze really began to take hold. After the debacle of Part 2, Wes Craven returned as a co-screenwriter along with such talents as Frank Darabont (\\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" \\"The Green Mile\\") and Director Chuck Russell (\\"The Blob\\") to ultimately get the franchise back on track. This time around, the film is a better-rounded mixture of horror, humor, special effects and a more thought out premise than its predecessor. Freddy is still up to his old tricks as he terrorizes the last of the Elm Street kids, who are now in a psychiatric ward. Nancy, the survivor of the original film, returns to potentially help these kids with the experimental drug called Hypnocil. This one is wildly inventive with some nice surprises along the way, as it is truly one of the very best installments of the long running franchise.   A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master  1988 / 99 min. / Rated R.  Director Renny Harlin (\\"Die Hard 2,\\" \\"Cliffhanger\\") helmed the Brian Helgeland (\\"L.A. Confidential,\\" \\"Mystic River\\") and Jim & Ken Wheat (credited as Scott Pierce) script. This is where the cracks certainly began to show, but oddly, this would also mark the series' zenith, as this would become the biggest of the `Elm Street' movies. In this outing, Freddy returns from the grave (with no real explanation) and he once again seeks out the survivors of Part 3, as well as their friends. This is a bit more of \\"by the numbers\\" filmmaking with very few surprises sprinkled in. We get much more humor than previously seen in the series, and the [solid] special effects were really starting to become the main attraction. Criticisms aside, the film does boast some genuinely likeable characters, and some cool imagery that manages to make this a mildly entertaining excursion. This would be the last `Elm Street' film to be able to make that claim for quite some time.  A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child  1989 / 89 min. / Rated R.  \\"Ouch\\". That is probably the best way to describe this sequel because it is truly painful to sit through. `The Dream Child' is easily the worst of the series. Director Stephen Hopkins (\\"Predator 2,\\" \\"The Ghost and The Darkness\\") and screenwriter Leslie Bohem (\\"House 3: The Horror Show,\\" \\"Dante's Peak\\") must've been sleepwalking through this one. Beyond what could have been a good premise - Freddy haunting the dreams of the unborn child of Alice, the survivor of Part 4 - this entry really offers nothing new or substantial. `Dream Child' is poorly plotted, horribly paced and far too much silliness (Super Freddy, anyone?). The franchise had been reduced to a gluttony of special effects, lame jokes and nothing of any substance. Devoid of any suspense or any true moments of creepiness - many may blame the butchering of the film by the MPAA for this - but in all seriousness, no amount of gore was saving this turkey.   Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare  1991 / 105 min. / Rated R.  The film's poster is adorned with the blurb \\"They Saved the Best ... for Last\\". Who are they kidding? This one is certainly an upgrade from the disaster of Part 5, and may not be as disappointing as Part 2, but shouldn't a movie about the death of Freddy be more eventful? In what was billed as `The Final Nightmare,' the story is more preposterous than ever. It's just filled with missed opportunities and a poorly conceived 3D finale. In fact, the latter - which can alsobe viewed in 3D in the series' DVD box set release - may be the film's biggest weakness. Had the film delivered a more satisfying and explosive finale, we may have forgiven the other flaws that had popped up throughout the movie. Littered with below average dialogue, celebrity cameos and none-too-funny one-liners, `Freddy's Dead' has little to offer beyond being watchable. It had been become more than evident that the franchise had exhausted itself when the film's best highlight may very well be the montage of clips played during the ending credits.  Wes Craven's New Nightmare  1994 / 112 min. / Rated R.  Wes Craven returns to write and direct the seventh installment to the never-ending Elm Street saga, and instead of delivering a \\"by the numbers\\" sequel, he actually concocted an intelligent premise centered around the return of original cast members Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon - even Jsu Garcia - and of course, Robert Englund. The Freddy character this time around is much, much darker than he had been in some of the previous sequels, and the film has a nice sense of dread throughout. This one successfully brought Freddy back to his roots, as the story is a well-made precursor to Craven's \\"Scream\\" franchise with its movie-in-a-movie concept. For all the slack Craven may sometimes receive, it seems evident that no one really understood Freddy better than its creator, and it should come as no surprise that the three best films in the franchise includes his involvement. `New Nightmare' is an ambitiously creative film that really turned out much better than one could have dreamed for.  Freddy vs. Jason  2003 / 97 min. / Rated R.    After the finale of 1993's \\"Jason Goes to Hell,\\" fans were holding their breath for what would ultimately take 10 years to make ... and that is \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\". Two horror icons in one film, face to face. Expectations were high ... maybe a little too high ... and for many, they were left with a bitter taste in their mouth after viewingthe film. However, in the tradition of Universal's classic horror film \\"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,\\" 'FvJ' is packaged as pure unadulterated fun. Those who were looking for honest-to-God scares should look elsewhere. Others will enjoy the film if they take for what it is; a campy horror film that offered some nice throwbacks to previous films in the series (the drug Hypnocil returning from 'Nightmare 3,' for example). Proceed with that in mind, and you may have some fun with this one.  Overall:  A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) *****  A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985) *  A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) ****  A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988) ***1/2  A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child (1989) *  Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) **  Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) ****  Freddy vs. Jason (2003) ****

B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween<br />1978 / 91 min. / Rated R<br /><br />Based off the reception of John Carpenter's 1976 film, \\"Assault on Precinct 13\\" at the Milan Film Festival, producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad had decided that Carpenter would be a perfect fit for a story originally titled \\"The Babysitter Murders\\". It wasn't until after Carpenter and 'Assault's' script supervisor/assistant editor, Debra Hill had finished their first draft of the script that Yablans had suggested setting the movie during Halloween and thus changing the title. Despite several suggestions by Yablans, Carpenter and Hill were granted free reign on the project, which according to Carpenter was a \\"50/50 collaboration\\" between the two. Written in less than three weeks, the \\"babysitter dialogue\\" was predominately done by Hill while Carpenter handled the darker elements of the film, most notably surrounding the character of Dr. Sam Loomis.<br /><br />Several incidences, places and names in the script were based off of Carpenter and Hill's experiences. The fictional Midwestern town of Haddonfield is actually the name of the town where Debra Hill was raised in New Jersey. The character name of Laurie Strode was lifted from an ex-girlfriend of Carpenter's, while the name Michael Myers was a tribute to a film distributor in London who was so instrumental in spring boarding Carpenter's career. The name Sam Loomis was homage to the character of the same name played by John Gavin in Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror masterpiece \\"Psycho,\\" while the name Tommy Doyle was homage, as well, from another Hitchcock classic, \\"Rear Window\\". However, the tributes and homage's do not end there ... but more on that later.<br /><br />With a completed script, casting quickly got underway. Both of Hammer Films' legends Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing turned down the role of Dr. Sam Loomis but based off of his daughter's love of Carpenter's \\"Assault on Precinct 13,\\" veteran Donald Pleasence had agreed to take on the role for a mere $20,000. Meanwhile, actress Anne Lockhart could not accept the role of Laurie Strode due to prior commitments, and it was Debra Hill who fought for the unknown actress, Jamie Lee Curtis. Hill thought the casting of Curtis would be great publicity as she is the daughter of the original \\"Scream Queen\\" Janet Leigh (\\"Psycho\\").<br /><br />Filming began in Pasadena, CA in the spring of 1978 with a budget around $325,000. With such a low budget, things like props and wardrobe were mainly second hand items or were purchased as inexpensively as possible. Even Carpenter who was the co-writer, director and composer was only paid $10,000 ... though Carpenter would wisely retain the 10% of the film's profits. Even more startling, Tommy Lee Wallace (who served as a location scout, production designer, art director and co-editor on the project) purchased a Captain James T. Kirk Halloween mask for just $1.98 and Wallace refined it by changing the hair, widening the eye sockets and whitening the skin tone. And despite Yablans dislike for the choice of the mask, Carpenter and Hill felt strongly that it was exactly what they were looking for.<br /><br />The film's flimsy budget would pigeonhole the production with limited time and locales. \\"Halloween\\" was only allocated 20 days to shoot the film. Since they were filming in California, it was Tommy Lee Wallace's job to find pumpkins and to purchase artificial leaves to make it appear to be the fall in the fictional Midwestern town. With money so tight, the \\"leaves\\" would have to be gathered and reused for a variety of scenes.<br /><br />The film would begin with homage to the opening sequence of the Orson Wells classic, \\"A Touch of Evil\\" though Carpenter would have to make his shot appear to be one take but yet, it was actually two. The scene deals - controversially enough - with an off-screen, ultra-quick sex scene that ends in a bloodbath with a young child named Michael Myers doing the brutal killing of his very ownsister. The film would then fast forward to 15 years later when Myers would escape from a mental hospital and once again terrorize his hometown of Haddonfield. And the rest, as they say, is history ... box office history.<br /><br />The film would open on October 25th 1978 and would eventually gross a whopping $47 million. With inflation, ticket sales would equate to over $140 million in today's marketplace. In fact, it was the biggest independent release up until \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in 1994. \\"Halloween\\" undeniably proved to be a critical and commercial smash with the likes of Roger Ebert stating the film to be \\"an absolutely merciless thriller, a movie so violent and scary that, yes, I would compare it to `Psycho'.\\"<br /><br />Much of the success of \\"Halloween\\" has always been attributed to John Carpenter's musical score that added so much mood and tension to the proceedings. However, no one would dare underscore the impeccable job done by the capable cast (special kudos to Jamie Lee Curtis, the great Donald Pleasence and Nick Castle as The Shape), the wonderful cinematography by Dean Cundey, and of course, the film's tight direction. Not to mention the underrated screenplay that is just filled with so many memorable lines of dialogue. It's just one of those films that - from start to finish - work on every level. For me, I always loved the atmosphere of the film. It has such an incredible feel that really captures the essence of the Halloween spirit. On a side note, there is also an extended version of the film which runs about 10 minutes longer. These additional scenes were shot for the film's television debut in 1981 on the set of Halloween II. It is certainly worth checking out.<br /><br />Now, over 30 years later, \\"Halloween\\" is in the pantheon as one of horror's greatest films, and rightfully so. In 1994, Entertainment Weekly chose the film as one of the greatest horror films ever made. In 2001, the American Film Institute named it as one of the most thrilling movies of the past 100 years. In 2006, \\"Halloween\\" was added to the National Film Registry, which preserves up to 25 films a year that are \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films\\". These are just a few examples of the impact left behind by \\"Halloween\\".<br /><br />Furthermore, in the past four decades, we've seen countless imitators, sequels, a remake and its sequel, large scale conventions, a wide array of memorabilia and an ever-growing rabid fan base that shows no end in sight. Since the original \\"Halloween,\\" the road may have been bumpy along the way for Michael Myers, but he's an undeniable legend, an all time great horror icon, and no ill-conceived sequel or crummy remake will ever take that away from him.

B000BCE918|4.0|Jurassic Park: The Franchise Collection  Jurassic Park (1993)   126min [PG-13] ****1/2   Director: Steven Spielberg.   Screenwriters: Michael Crichton and David Koepp.  Cast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Bob Peck, Martin Ferrero, Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, B.D. Wong.  Review: Billionaire John Hammond (Attenborough) invites paleontologist Dr. Grant (Neill), and paleobotanist Dr. Sattler (Dern), while the \\"bloodsucking lawyer\\" invites \\"rock star\\" mathematician Ian Malcom (Goldblum) to inspect an amusement park located off the island of Isla Nublar. Now, this isn't Six Flags or Disneyland here, but an amusement park populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs. The latter is actually delivered in an intriguing way that actually makes you believe `hey, that sounds possible!' Essentially, InGen scientists have taken dino-DNA that has been preserved inside amber-encased mosquitoes along with frog DNA to complete the missing strand. Viola! Dinosaurs!  The eccentric billionaire is so convinced that this is just some regular walk in the park that he even invites his own grandchildren to tag along. Soon, all hell breaks loose when a disgruntled Jurassic Park employee (Knight) disables the security system so he can successfully steal some dino embryos. Now, the experts, and the grandchildren need to fight for their lives against a carnivorous T-Rex and some wily raptors. The film is loaded with some truly magical and/or awe-inspiring moments like the first revelation of the dinosaurs, or the first attack of the ferocious T-Rex. This is all of course heightened by the wonderful musical score by John Williams and the near-seamless animatronics and computer effects that deservingly took home the Oscar that year. Spielberg lays on the suspense, and action with some genuine moments of chills and thrills. Not to mention, a good sense of humor.   \\"Jurassic Park\\" became a phenomenon in 1993, and it would not onlyspawn two sequels, but it also paved the way to such films like, \\"Jumanji,\\" Mighty Joe Young,\\" and an Americanized \\"Godzilla,\\" to name a few. Those films, however, could never touch the wonderment, and excitement that \\"Jurassic Park\\" was able to conjure up ... and still able to possess today. Now, this shouldn't be confused with the greatness of \\"Jaws,\\" but this is one hell of an entertaining movie.   The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)  134min. [PG-13] ***1/2  Director: Steven Spielberg  Screenwriter: David Koepp  Cast: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, Richard Attenborough, Vince Vaughn, Vanessa Lee Chester, Peter Stormare, Harvey Jasoon, Richard Schiff, Thomas F. Duffy, Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards.  Review: Disappointing follow-up to mega-hit \\"Jurassic Park\\" reveals that there was a second island. Apparently, Hammond would have the dinosaurs bred on Isla Sorna, and then shipped 80 miles to the park. Without any assistance, \\"nature has found a way,\\" and the dinosaurs are flourishing in this \\"lost world\\". So, Hammond now wants to send a new team to investigate the dinosaurs' progress. From the start, there are some obvious cracks in the logic being displayed in the film. In the first film, we were shown that the dinosaurs are born, and engineered at the park. So essentially, they now want us believe that the dinosaurs were born at the park, but shipped to site B for breeding, only to be returned to the park sometime later. Seems impractical and expensive, if you ask me. Why didn't the engineering and breeding happen all on one island?   That aside, Jeff Goldblum returns as a now humiliated Ian Malcolm, who must go (along with a small team) to this second island to rescue his paleontologist girlfriend (Moore). This is another illogical set-up. As I stated earlier, Hammond wanted a team of four to investigate the dinosaurs on site B (where there is no barricades), and wanted Ian Malcolm - the one character he not only disliked from the first film, but who he also thought was unqualified - to go. This contrived sequel is filled with some truly dumb characters that refuse to understand their deadly surroundings, and Malcolm gets an unnecessary and unexplained black offspring. The latter is the most puzzling addition. In the first film Malcolm states he has three children, and apparently multiple ex-wives. Now, all we get is that he has a 13 year-old black daughter that can defeat a velociraptor using ridiculously complicated gymnastic moves. Oookay.  We also get the spectacle of a T-Rex running amok in the streets of San Diego during the film's climax even though little logic is implored in doing so. How exactly does the T-Rex devour the entire crew of the boat, and then lock itself back into the cargo hold? This is certainly one messy sequel that is really only saved by the still stunning visual effects, Goldblum's likeability and comedic timing, as well as some exciting edge of your seat action scenes. You can find a lot to be entertained by as long as you chuck your brain at the door, and try not to closely scrutinize things like plot and character motivations. That is easier said than done, however.  Jurassic Park III (2001)  93min. [PG-13] ****  Director: Joe Johnston (\\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,\\" \\"Jumanji\\")  Screenwriters: Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor  Cast: Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, Michael Jeter, John Diehl, Bruce A. Young, Laura Dern.  Review: Steven Spielberg decided to relinquish the director's chair to Joe Johnston this time around, and opted to don his executive-producer hat instead. While Johnston lacks Spielberg's directorial flair, he certainly makes up for it with break-neck pacing, and after the lengthy `Lost World,' that was a welcomed decision. Thankfully, there is no dull or unnecessary filler in this one.  Sam Neill returns as Dr. Grant, as he is financially persuaded by a rich businessman (Macy) to lead anaerial-expedition over site B, and ultimately, the plane lands on the restricted dinosaur island. This short and sweet sequel (clocks in a little over 80 minutes without closing credits) is an entertaining popcorn flick that uses some nice twists and turns with its characters, and an enhanced sense of humor to keep the film moving. This time around, unlike the previous two films, the T-Rex takes a backseat to the new dino on the block, the Spinosaurus. That alone does ponder the question, \\"where the hell was the Spinosaurus in `The Lost World'\\"? How could the biggest dinosaur go unnoticed?  Aside from little nitpicks here or there, the action is full throttle in this sequel, and while certain visual effects aren't as seamless as they were in previous outings, this is still a surprisingly entertaining thrill ride that is an improvement over Part 2. The John Williams theme is still effective; the apocalyptic-like setting is top notch, and it was great to have the return of Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler (Dern). And though their break-up is never addressed, at least the film was never bogged down with any sort of resentment or anger between the two characters. With that said, there are die hard \\"Jurassic Park\\" fans that do take issue with that, as well as the inclusion of the Spinosaurus, and the exclusion of John Hammond and/or Ian Malcolm characters. You can't please everyone, but as it stands, I for one, found this to be solid popcorn flick. Thumbs up for me.  The Bonus Features   Like any good collection, you always crave some nice special features. Here, Universal do not disappoint as all three films get a nice treatment with a wide assortment of featurettes, commentaries, some deleted scenes, trailers, storyboards, and honestly, a host of other nifty features.

B000UJCALI|5.0|May 23rd 1980: Opening on Memorial Day weekend - a mere two days after The Empire Strikes Back - The Shining hit theaters, ultimately earning $44,017,374 at the domestic box office. The Stephen King novel, in which the film was based, also spawned a miniseries in 1997 by director Mick Garris.  Review: The Shining would mark the third Stephen King adaptation. The first was the theatrically released classic from Brian De Palma, Carrie, and the second being the Tobe Hooper miniseries, Salem's Lot. It would be the difficult task for Stanley Kubrick, one of cinema's greatest filmmakers, to co-adapt [with novelist Diane Johnson] and helm the bestselling novel.  For a brief refresher: the film centers on recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance, who is a writer that accepts the job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, and moves in with his wife and his son in the process. Soon, as the family gets snowed in at the isolated hotel, Jack begins to slowly slip into madness.  Technically, this film is a masterpiece; special kudos to the setting, the musical score and the cinematography, in particular. The production design of the Overlook is ominously spacious which helps capture the desired vibe which is only enhanced by the hair-raising musical score. Kubrick's meticulousness coupled with the incredible cinematography - the tracking shots are impeccably handled - the film attacks the viewer with both sight and sound. There is so much of this movie that will truly stay with you long after it is over. The images of the identical twins, the wave of blood crashing out of the elevator, or The Overlook Maze have caused many of sleepless nights. So has Jack Nicholson's Oscar-worthy performance of Jack Torrance. His dialogue - such as the ad-libbed \\"Here's Johnny!\\" - is littered with some of filmdom's most devilishly quotable lines. Even now, 30 years later, few horror films have ever come close to rivaling The Shining. It holds up as one of the genre's most creepiest and unsettling films.From the perspective of an outside spectator, however, The Shining may not have seemed destined for greatness. Principal photography for the film, which lasted for over a year, as Kubrick was consistently changing the script and shooting scenes that would exceed as many as a hundred takes was anything but ideal -- though Kubrick was never known to be one that rushes. The grueling production schedule - which was predominately shot on soundstages with some of the largest sets ever constructed - was brilliantly chronicled in the widely available documentary, The Making of the Shining, by Kubrick's daughter, Vivian. Like the film it covers, it is a must see.  The Shining's initial critical response, however, was mixed, as even Stephen King was unhappy by most of Kubrick's decisions, which included, but not limited to, the various changes from the book and the casting of Jack Nicholson. Ultimately, the author would be proven wrong, as Kubrick's take on The Shining is widely considered to be one of the genre's best as it has been celebrated numerous times by the American Film Institute, as well as today's most respected critics and filmmakers alike.  The Shining (Two-Disc Special Edition) or the single disc Blu-ray both feature an informative commentary track by Steadicam Inventor/Operator Garrett Brown and Historian John Baxter. Beyond the aforementioned The Making of the Shining (which includes an optional commentary), there are three new featurettes (View from the Overlook: Crafting the Shining, The Visions of Stanley Kubrick, and Wendy Carlos, Composer). As to be expected, the set includes the film's theatrical trailer, as well. It's a wonderful release that has never made the film look or sound better. Do yourself a favor, and pick this bad boy up.

B001GQSY5K|4.0|Star Wars: The Clone Wars  2008 / 98 min. / Rated PG  Let me make this clear; I am an unabashed Star Wars geek. I have seen all six films in the theater multiple times; I've also owned all those films multiple times on multiple formats over the years; I own the two volumes of the Cartoon Network's Clone Wars DVDs and yes, I even own the two made-for-TV Ewok adventures. Not to mention, I own some magazines, books, T-shirts, some posters and a couple of toys here or there. Suffice it to say, I'm a big fan who knows more than they really should about a fictional universe. For me, the original Star Wars trilogy, Episodes IV through VI, is the epitome of film trilogies and will never be equaled or surpassed. Furthermore, as a six-part whole, it's undoubtedly my favorite movie franchise of all time. Yes, I'm not ashamed to admit it; I truly enjoy the prequels, as well. So, it should come as no surprise that if you slap Star Wars on something, I'm bound to give it a go, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars is no exception to the rule.     Heading in, I practically knew nothing about the film other than the fact that it takes place in between Episodes II and III. Essentially, this film is an introduction to the television series that will debut later this fall on TNT and the Cartoon Network. So, let me make this abundantly clear before I continue, this film doesn't add anything of any substance to the previous set of films nor is it essential viewing. However, with that said, the film does supply enough of a quick fix to pacify most Star Wars junkies.     First off, this film should in no way be compared to any of the much superior live-action films that preceded it. This film - which is essentially a glorified pilot episode for the upcoming TV series - is a whole new ball of wax. Directed by Dave Filoni, The Clone Wars predominately centers around Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter) and his new padawan learner Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) who find themselves on a mission to save theson of Jabba the Hutt (Kevin Michael Richardson) and return him to the Tatooine crime lord. Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and his sinister minions, including Asajj Ventress (Nika Futterman), will stop at nothing to ensure that Anakin and Ahsoka fail at their quest. Right off the bat, the one thing that instantly hits the viewer is the oddity that a Star Wars film begins with the Warner Bros. logo as opposed to the typical 20th Century Fox logo, as well as the lack of John Williams' famous musical score and the equally famous opening scroll. Being the geek that I am, I was surely a bit bummed that no one in the entre film uttered the words, \\"I got a bad feeling about this\\". But as I said, this isn't the live-action films, and perhaps it's unfair to have had such expectations. This is its own beast.     Now, much has been discussed about the look of the film and while the CGI animation is far from being on the level of Pixar or DreamWorks, the animation still had a fittingly - and charmingly - throwback type of feel to it. In fact, I ended up digging the look much more than I thought I would. The action scenes, in particular, are actually handled quite well, as they are plentiful and often exciting. It would have been even grander had it been accompanied by John Williams' musical score, but I digress ...     Admittedly, after a bumpy intro, I was surprised the film started to click with me despite the empty and mostly juvenile dialogue exchanges between Skywalker and Ahsoka. So much more substantive dialogue could've been extracted from their unlikely pairing but alas, it was not meant to be - at least, not yet. Not to mention, I would've also liked to have seen more Yoda (Tom Kane), more Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), and yes, even more Obi-Wan Kenobi. The latter is actually well-voiced by James Arnold Taylor who often sounds like Ewan McGregor! Thankfully, I'm sure I'll get much more of these characters later this year.      On a side note, I should mention that Idid find it odd that there are certain elements of the film that certainly skew toward an older audience while other elements (mostly, the attempts at humor) try to cater to the kiddie crowd. That's always a tough balancing act, and The Clone Wars certainly struggles with that throughout the film. With that said, young boys will probably be the film's biggest fans, and despite the flaws, adults will - at worst - think its 'OK'.     For me - as a die hard Star Wars fan - this animated excursion frequently put a smile on my face with its lively action sequences, familiar characters and its sense of old school fun. Unexpectedly, the film did manage to conjure up some of that old Star Wars nostalgia. Spotty dialogue and Ziro the Hutt notwithstanding, Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a pretty entertaining movie for what it is and it has certainly piqued my interest for the upcoming TV series which at the end of the day, was the whole point behind this film. So, overall, my admittedly biased rating is *** (out of 4 stars)     By the way, be sure to stick around after the end credits.
0061714372|5.0|I bought this because i loved Megadeth I expected to see a book about his time with them, but i got something better, the story of Dave Mustaine's abusive childhood, his early life, how he got his guitar skills, how he started his drug abuse, how he started a band, how he joined Metallica, his side of the story on his departure, his intresting story of his first impressions of the member who became members for Megadeth, how the moniker \\"Megadeth\\" was chosen as the name, his time making his first album, his stories of funny mischief, how he met his wife pam, his attempts to clean up his act, how megadeth broke up, how he lost feeling of his arm, and how his life has turned toward christainity. The book is big with pictures placed throughout the book, mostly black and white. the book is very discriptive and the layout keeps you intrested, for instance, every chapter begins with a quote that is said in the climax of the chapter, the book is a amazing autobiography of the man who never got to tell his side of the story, you'll definitlly get what you want with this book and more...

B00151HZ3S|4.0|I had wanted to listen to a complete recording of Der Ring des Nibelungen for over 10 years but did not get a chance to pick one up until a few weeks ago (I had listened to plenty of excerpts and highlights before).  Well, I'm glad I did because I finally got to listen to one of the most monumental pieces of drama - music or otherwise - ever conceived.  So after experiencing the whole Ring for the first time can I recommend this set to others, either relative newbies like myself or experienced Wagnerites?  Well, yes, although there are some reservations.<br /><br />Orchestral-wise this may be the finest Ring ever.  Some conductors like to take this very long cycle of music fast (like Solti), sometimes even to the point of brutality (B&ouml;hm) to highlight the dark drama in the Ring, while others (like Knappertsbusch) like to go a little slower to highlight the lyricism in Wagner's music... sometimes to the point of going too slow and inducing slumber (Goodall).  Bernard Haitink strikes a balance between the two methods and draws out an emotional expressiveness while maintaining a dramatic urgency.  This is not simply taking a middle-of-the-road approach or sitting on the fence musically - Haitink is one of the few conductors (that I have heard anyway) to bring true balance to the orchestral music of Richard Wagner's magnum opus.  Amazingly he does this while not putting an egotistical personal stamp on it (\\"This is MY Ring!\\") - in fact, he doesn't put an egotistical stamp on anything at all here.  You won't see his picture anywhere on the packaging, for instance.  How often does that happen?  Kudos.<br /><br />The singers are mostly good.  I really liked James Morris as Wotan - powerful and commanding!  Siegfried Jerusalem is great in his namesake role.  All of the other parts are well done too.  Unfortunately - as many of those who have reviewed this have already said - the weak link on this set is Br&uuml;nnhilde, played here by Eva Marton.  Now, I don't *hate* Marton's voice, and I thought that she was good in Die Walk&uuml;re - powerful and dramatic but not overly so, and she does manage to do okay (just) during her Immolation Scene at the end of G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung.  But on the rest of that opera and Siegfried she is... less than satisfactory.  She's fine in those later operas when she's at lower volume, but the moment the loudness starts to go up, well... let's just say I was reminded of the sound of the phaser weapons on Star Trek (\\"Set soprano on stun, Mr. Spock!\\").  After a while I kinda got used to it, but if Br&uuml;nnhilde is the make-it-or-break-it factor for you when it comes to a Ring Cycle you may want to pass on this one.<br /><br />Well, enough about the actual music (because others here have reviewed this *far* better than I ever could).  What about the set that this wonderful music comes in?  Well, this is a budget-priced compact box set and fits very nicely on your shelf with less space taken up compared to the old individual opera boxes.  This box from EMI comes with 14 CDs in cardboard sleeves and a small booklet that gives a synopsis of the plot.  There is no libretto included here (like all modern opera sets) but that isn't a big problem for me as I feel that you shouldn't be reading along with a 15 hour long music drama in a teeny-tiny little CD booklet anyway... go get yourself a libretto (I got [[ASIN:0393008673 this one]]) and have fun - your eyes will thank you.  I would have liked the booklet to have a little more information on this recording of the Ring - info on the conductor and singers, for instance - but I guess that wasn't deemed important by the makers of this product.  Oh well.  I also didn't like the cardboard sleeves for the CDs that much - I realize that they did this so all of the discs could fit in the box and save space and money (for which I am grateful - I would not have been able to afford this otherwise) but the discs are harder to extract than from a standard CD case.So, there's a trade-off.  It is up to you to decide whether it is worth it or not to get this or one of the older sets.  On a positive bonus note I would like to point out that I really like the box art for this: a single flaming ring... very simple, very elegant, very cool.<br /><br />In conclusion, I enjoyed this Ring very much and would recommend it to first time listeners for its fine balance and awesome conducting.  However, I realize that the leading lady might be problematic for some - I would suggest listening to some sound samples from this; if the sound of Eva Marton's voice bothers you then you might not want to pick this up - you'll be listening to quite a lot of it.  But if it doesn't then go ahead and get this and prepare to be immersed in a powerful and involving drama of greed and selflessness, power and submission, helplessness and heroism, fate and determination, hate and love - in short the totality of human emotion and experience in 15 hours of music.  What more could you ask for?It is up to you to decide whether it is worth it or not to get this or one of the older sets.

1439163154|5.0|I'm not sure what these 1 star reviewers are expecting. I thought this book was entertaining and fun. Its not supposed to be Oscar Wilde or Allen Ginsberg. Its not a Pulizer Prize waiting to happen but so what. It does the job. It entertained me for a few hours.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Nice tribute to the perfection of snes rpgs. Music is whimsical and the art is smooth. The gameplay is reminiscent of titles such as Chrono Trigger in a sense that there are no hidden random encounters, just the visible monsters roaming around. The touch screen interface is also an epic edition to the gameplay, giving you what you fiestas wanted from your emulated games. I have to say that this is a refreshing blast from the past that is well worth ther $2.99 that is being charged. 5 stars.
B00466HN86|5.0|My family just returned home from seeing this movie with our church, Ephesus Baptist in Villa Rica, Ga. and I came right away to see if it was available for purchase.   We all loved the movie! The acting was very well done and the story was heart touching and even funny much of the time.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone, but most especially men who may have no idea the impact they have, positively or negatively, on a child's life.
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|I was urged by others to watch Suits. I am so glad I finally gave it a try. It is my Tip Top Fave among new shows in 2011. My only complaint is that the first season was just too short. If you want details about the show, find the review on Amazon by Grady Harp. That is an excellent and comprehensive review.<br /><br />I'm a dedicated fan of Gina Torres, so I'm lovin' her mastery of this very stylish new role. I'm also very impressed with the other female regulars. These characters are strong, smart, witty, and independent with nary a cliche' among them to cling to; well acted, but also very well written.<br /><br />Mike Ross is adorable, brash yet humble, and somehow seems like everybody's favorite cousin most of the time. He caves in to the vampire prince, Trevor, too easily and that's my one caution on this series. I hope the writers will do everything in their power to avoid falling into the formulaic style that forces them to reuse familiar devices like Trevor to engineer conflict into an episode. A guy like Trevor would keep coming back, but a guy like Mike with a break like this job would kick the ratfink to the curb or call in special forces before he'd belly up again with that punk.<br /><br />Haven't had so much fun with a show since Castle came out and I haven't enjoyed dialogue & story so much since Aaron Sorkin left West Wing. Leverage I also like, but it's the difference between cotton candy and a Red Velvet Cupcake.<br /><br />The comparison to The Good Wife is not useful in my opinion. Good Wife uses the law firm as a backdrop for the character dramas, but the story is driven by sexual encounters. Suits uses the business of law as the catalyst and the stories are more about how the actual work develops character.<br /><br />And Gabriel Macht! Dear Lord, what a classy character. Everytime I want to label him as a Mako, he surprises me with a big teddy bear move. There is a terrible tension that one must wrestle in a powerful position like Harvey's. It's the random acts of goodness that keep us human and alive on the inside. Well-written character, acted to perfection.<br /><br />Kudos all around and Keep Up the GREAT work!and alive on the inside. Well-written character, acted to perfection.  Kudos all around and Keep Up the GREAT work!
B004EPZ09S|3.0|Contagion, directed by Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich, The Limey) and written by Scott Z. Burns (The Informant!), is something of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it's a highly interesting film about the outbreak of a global pandemic and how various organizations and individuals respond to it.  It has an all-star cast of highly talented actors, it's well researched and intelligently written, and the director manages to follow all of the interweaving sub-stories fairly smoothly.  But all of that said, I found that in the end, except for the odd bit here and there, I was never emotionally engaged by it.  Which, when you remember that you're witnessing the deaths of about half of the characters you see on the screen, is a strong indication that something important is missing.<br /><br />The best part of the film is in the two opening sequences.  In the first sequence, with no real dialogue to speak of, we see a stream of images, of people touching things, of other people then touching those things, then touching themselves, then touching other people, the camera following contact to contact as the viewer is wordlessly shown just how fast and how wide a virus or bacterium could potentially spread.  Then, in the second sequence, the story actually begins on Day Two of the outbreak, and we are shown three individuals - a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) on a plane coming back to Minnesota from a trip, a young Chinese man (Tien You Chui) in Hong Kong going home from work, and a Japanese businessman (Yoshiaki Kobayashi) on a commuter train in Tokyo - all of whom are all coming down with something. And from these three people, the pandemic proceeds to spread.  The real thing that makes the viewer stay to the end is the final revelation of the mystery:  just where did the virus come from and how were these disparate individuals linked together.  Soderbergh accomplishes this in a clever way which, looking back, should have been obvious from the beginning.  He starts the story at Day Two, but only at the end does he take us back to Day One where all of the clues we are shown along the way are finally tied together.<br /><br />On a technical level, Contagion is praiseworthy for grounding its medical and biological aspects firmly in actual science and in portraying the various government and international health organizations realistically in terms of how they actually respond to infectious outbreaks.  And Contagion is also commendable for showing that not everything goes smoothly, that even in the face of a lethal epidemic, overlapping agencies can be fractious over matters of administrative turf and budget, that commercial considerations can delay critically-needed actions, and that some individuals will take advantage of privilege and power to protect themselves at the expense of others.<br /><br />But for all of its technical accuracy and the clarity of its presentation, Contagion never seems to really connect emotionally.  Part of the reason for this failure to connect on an emotional level is that there really are no surprises. Almost every clich&eacute; that tends to pop up in this genre shows up here.  The doctor who uses herself as a guinea pig to test the vaccine.  The health official who violates ethics by calling to warn his wife to get out of the city before a quarantine is ordered, who in turn ends up telling other people.  The scientist who goes against orders and comes up with a vitally needed discovery.  The riots that ensue when a pharmacy runs out of a medication. Social order breaking down.  About every other character dying at some point.  And finally, a cure is found and the world is saved.  The end.<br /><br />The other part of why Contagion fails to connect is that, in attempting for a global scope, it spreads itself too thin where its characters are concerned.  The ensemble cast is impressive.  Gwyneth Paltrow as Beth Emhoff, the first victim we see succumb to the virus.  Matt Damon as Mitch, her husband, does a creditable job as a man who struggles to cope with the fact that his wife was only coughing the day before and then suddenly goes from seizures to death in a hospital the next, and who then goes home and to find that his young son has died as well. Other myriad roles are filled by high caliber actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Ehle, Chin Han and others.  There's also a cameo with TV's ubiquitous health authority Dr. Sanjay Gupta as himself.  But all of that acting power ends up largely being wasted because the individual characters are limited in their screen time and character development often ends up being sacrificed to the needs of the plot.  Damon, with Anna Jacoby-Heron as his teen-aged daughter, Jory, gets more screen time than most as the film tries to show what ordinary people would be experiencing in this situation, but again the lack of surprises and the been-there-seen-that feel of their scenes works against him.<br /><br />Two particular performances however are worth pointing out.  Elliot Gould does a low key but perfect turn as Dr. Ian Sussman, a research scientist who decides to follow his instincts and goes against orders to destroy his samples, resulting in a key breakthrough.  In a brief but touching scene, Gould conveys Sussman's weighing the difficulty of his decision just through his facial expression and body language, a masterful performance by a highly underrated actor.  And Jude Law's less than scrupulous freelance blog-journalist Alan Krumwiede (a perfect name for his low-life character) fills the role of the film's only real human villain.  A brief scene between the two gives the film its best single line:  \\"Blogging isn't writing,\\" an exasperated Gould vents at Law, who's been pestering him for information. \\"It's graffiti with punctuation!\\"  And in another scene with a pharmaceutical rep, Law gets in the film's other memorable line:  \\"It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.\\"<br /><br />All in all, Contagion isn't a bad film.  It is interesting if you want a believable and fairly accurate portrayal of just how this scenario would likely unfold.  But the human element is largely lost in the mix, which robs the film of the emotional impact you instinctively feel a film of this sort should have.  Recommended, but adjust your expectations accordingly.with the fact that his wife was only coughing the day before and then suddenly goes from seizures to death in a hospital the next, and who then goes home and to find that his young son has died as well.

A brief scene between the two gives the film its best single line:  \\"Blogging isn't writing,\\" an exasperated Gould vents at Law, who's been pestering him for information. \\"It's graffiti with punctuation!\\"  And in another scene with a pharmaceutical rep, Law gets in the film's other memorable line:  \\"It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.\\"  All in all, Contagion isn't a bad film.  It is interestingif you want a believable and fairly accurate portrayal of just how this scenario would likely unfold.  But the human element is largely lost in the mix, which robs the film of the emotional impact you instinctively feel a film of this sort should have.  Recommended, but adjust your expectations accordingly.

B00181JGI2|5.0|The Big Lebowski is a iconic movie that should be available for everyone in any media. It is  not. In my country, I cannot find this through the streaming movie channels available, apparantly, it's too old. Amazon has it, but only to US customers. I tried everywhere to watch this legally from my country, but in vain. Finally, I turned to torrent search, and downloaded it for free within 15 min.  Why does the movie industry complain over illegal downloading, when they ACTIVELY prevent legal downloading?

1936719010|5.0|If you read Steven Pressfield's War of Art, this is a great follow up.  While not as in depth as War of Art, it takes some of the recommendations from the first and pushes you more into action.  As a creative, I'm always looking for inspiration from kindred spirits who are in the trenches and know what it is to bring something into being.  Even if you're not a writer, this is a high recommend if you're engaged in any creative endeavor, large or small.

034544678X|5.0|It is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. So exciting that I had to refrain myself to go further and read few pages (if not the whole title) in advance at the next chapters and come back to my reading impatiently; Or yet going backward to previous pages to find back a beautifully written description of a dog expression and check it on my dog's face. Thus it was a very enjoyable back and forth reading that I never wanted to end. When came to the end, I was relieved finding many more insights and wonderful reading suggestions at the reference section.   To me it's a book to re-read from time to time, again and again. It's the best book to understand your dog/s, other dogs and in general other mammals and humans as primates. Some may find the passages on humans and other mammals too long and out of the context; but myself on the contrary I enjoyed them enough for giving me a perspective for the similarities and differences between dogs and humans. McConnell guided me on what to expect from my dog and not to expect, and what my dog expects from me. It's a good book for both scientific minded people as well as for more sentimental dog lovers. It has wisdom, it has deep knowledge, it has love and compassion and it has cautious scientific approach. It doesn't offer though clear cut formulas for dog training that you can find in some other books of McConnell (namely: Family Friendly Dog Training) but even better it gives you the basic and complete understanding of your best friend's mind (or its best approximate).  After all what else do we need other than a deep understanding for a happy companionship? Thank you McConnell.
B000YABIQ6|2.0|I love \\"Mad Men\\", and have wanted to start collecting the dvd sets for awhile now, but they have generally been priced higher than I wanted to pay.  Imagine my excitement, then, when I found Amazon selling a new copy of season 1 for only $9.99- I was thrilled, but also cautious- there had to be a catch.  I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order.  It just arrived yesterday, but instead of a boxed set with an episode guide, it's a black dvd case with 2 plastic trays inside to hold all 4 dvds.  No episode guide, just the season 1 slipcover.  It looks like someone put this together out of their home.  I recognize I got a great deal, but if Amazon is not actually selling me the boxed set, then that information should be specified somewhere- I would have paid a little more to get the actual product instead of a homemade knock-off.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|After I read the 1st book in the series I found that I \\"had\\" to read the others because I was so invested in Katniss.  Here's a young girl who from the moment you meet her she is a pawn in someone else's game.  Living in district 12 she becomes a tribute for the Hunger Games where children fight to the death for the amusement of the Capital.  During the games she struggles to determine other people's motives as well as her own.  Does her fellow tribute Peeta really love her or is this really just a strategy to survive the games?  As you follow her throughout the three books you realize that Katniss is always being used for someone else's ulterior motives and then you start to see her own strategy come into play.  I loved the series and found the characters interesting and often sad.  Each of the characters changes, grows, and are often distroyed emotionally but somehow come thru it.  Not unchanged, but they survive.  Well worth the read
B00466HN86|5.0|Just watched the movie in theaters today. It immediatly started with an action scene that had me on the edge of my seat. Minutes later I was filled with laughter, deep thought, and tears pouring down my cheeks. Highly recommended this movie for everyone, especially fathers. The day this movie is released on DVD I'll be an owner of it. I'm going to even buy it to send to all my family members. It's a must for any movie collection!
B005N0PJJO|5.0|First let me say that paying $9.99 for a book is not something I normally do, but this one was worth every penny.  The Fifty Shades series has some incrediably hot sex in it but I really find it secondary to the emotional relationship of Christian and Ana.  This book is about love, learning to give it, learning to accept it, and what unconditional love means.   Yes, Christian is a perfect alpha male, sexy, rich, jealous, insecure, possesive, and broken.  There is one scene where the writer shows just how broken and 50 shades of f'ed-upped he is that tore my heart out.    The third book cannot come out fast enough, I can't wait to see how Christian and Ana progress in their relationship.

B005GIS8VE|4.0|I almost didn't rent this because of the one star review that last person posted.  I'm not sure what their problem is but my girl and I both enjoyed this movie a lot.

0446556750|4.0|Mick Haller is an honest man and good at what he does, although he may at times allow himself to be caught up in the \\"game\\" that court trials have become and lose sight of what it is really supposed to be about-- justice.  Mick brings in his ex-wife Maggie to play second chair during the trial. Maggie pushes him and makes him better. The sexual tension between them adds a lot of nice energy. You feel that Mick is always trying to live up to his ex-wife's expectations of him, and that he dreads ever letting her down. They have the quintessential love-hate relationship.  Mick also has an investigator working the case by the name of Harry Bosch. They didn't really delve into the backstory on these guys, but it seems that perhaps Mick and Harry are half-brothers. There seems to be tension and an air of disapproval between them, but they work well together.  This is my first Connelly story, so I don't know the history of Haller, McPherson and Bosch, but I enjoyed the familiarity that played out amongst them, and there was lots of tension-- sexual chemistry, resentment, old grudges-- along with mutual respect.  My final word: I don't believe there was ever a moment in this story where I found myself bored, as there was plenty of suspense. It was very easy to read, with lots of dialogue, and great characters-- just the way I like it! The conclusion may have been slightly anti-climatic, but not enough to have detracted from the story at all. I normally don't read much crime fiction, but this one left me wanting to go back and read all of the others to precede it in the series.

B005G4TJI4|3.0|Loved the first two films & was very happy with the 2-disc DVDs.  This film however in my opinion & I'm sure there will be a lot of dissension was over done, over long & under featured on the blu-ray/dvd combo pack. I am seriously glad I did not see this in the theater in 3d because it must have been totally overwhelming. I could not wait for it to end.  Sorry but sometimes less is a lot  more.  Except where features are concerned.  Total lack is very disappointing but I won't be repurchasing another copy.
B00536OCZA|3.0|The pressing quality is not quite up to par. There was quite a bit of surface noise in the lead-in and the trail-out deadwax. Many annoying pops and ticks while playing on various different tracks. Multiple cleanings helped, but only cut surface noise a bit. The record labels are bubbled around the outer edge. One side of the record has a streak across it from the outer edge to the deadwax. The sound quality is OK but not really impressive compared to the 2003 30th Anniversary edition. The original 1973 U.S. version of the LP actually sounds better than the 2011 version. The U.K. and German SQ quadraphonic versions are superior to all. The gatefold album cover and the extras inside, like the posters and stickers, are the best of the best.

From there her life changes drastically and she's a suspect of murder when she finds her mother dead later that same day after having a vision (premonition)of her own death at the very same spot. The story goes from there with lots of twists and turns that include her older sister Violet and the new neighbor next door named Joe. At one point the story had me crying and in others smiling. An excellent story to read that was unpredictable and different.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Well over the course of 2 weekends I've watched these films with my children and spouse.  I am the only of them who has ever seen all six prior.    I grew up with a deep love for the star wars universe, though I never took it to fanboy-ism (although I did buy a star wars belt buckle recently)  Changes, no changes.  Honestly, I don't really care.  The continuous releases have allowed a continued interest passed on now to a generation that \\"doesn't know any better\\".  thanx to these being put out yet again, my kids now love star wars too and the boy is asking when we can watch them again.  I can deal with the eye sores for the sake of having common ground with a 5 year old.  It would have been cool to get the original theatrical releases included, but honestly that shouldn't be a deal breaker for anyone considering the set.  I feel the story, the universe, really is that good, enjoy it.  I can understand and appreciate the pain of watching your childhood get screwed with in profound ways, I am a G1 transformers fan after all, but my nerd rage will do nothing good to anyone.  The picture quality and sound are astounding(even Vaders \\"Noooo\\").   Buy it,it's money well spent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was dubious when this series was recommended to me because it is categorized as young adult fiction. But I got caught up in the story right away and kept reading. The plot and the rich settings are both captivating. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an escapist read.
B000784WMW|5.0|I've loved the book since I've read it as a 12-year old girl, and have seen every version as it came out, and I have yet to be as satisfied with a screen version of the book as I was with this version. That's not to say that it's not without weaknesses (low budget scenes and tech stuff), but the weaknesses did not detract from the overall portrayal of the novel. Sure, there are soap operatic close-ups on actors to end scenes, but remember, this IS a Victorian novel. There's a natural melodrama about it that those expecting a modern-day version often don't \\"get,\\" and most likely never will. I, for one, never cared about special effects and musical dance interludes, so I'm probably the wrong person to ask about those things. I like those silly things like plot and character development. And this is where this version truly surpasses other versions. The Joan Fontaine version thoroughly infuriated me with its revisions, and most modern versions don't capture the true natures of Jane and Rochester. Timothy Dalton perfectly rants and broods and runs hot and cold like I envisioned Rochester: a man very close to the edge who can be brought to peace through the love of a passionate woman who has learned to check those passions and use them for good. I agree that he probably is a little too handsome, but I wouldn't say that I couldn't see the ugliness in him. He made me see the trouble and chaos and weariness of the character, and he didn't look pretty. The much-maligned Clark depicts Jane in a way that many underestimate because of its very subtlety. I agree that she appears a little long in the tooth for the role (but I wouldn't exactly card Mary or Diana either), but the irony of the character is that she has a wisdom beyond her years, and maybe that requires an older actress to understand and portray. I think she looked the perfect part of Jane, not pretty or ugly, just exceptionally plain, with a hint at attractive merriment when delighted by something. Her passion doesnot seem like much to a modern audience, but thinking of the Victorian time, she is exceptionally plain-spoken (with Rochester being off the charts, but forgiven because of his wealth). She guards herself because of the abuse she experienced as a girl, and because of the degradation she experienced as a poor servant in under a society of strict social classes. When one truly understands all the context of the time and characterizations in the novel, it is difficult to NOT appreciate this version.
B0051CSIKQ|3.0|Stake Land was a dark but realistic description of an alternate reality where vampires have caused a end-of-the-world scenario.

B005D63RQK|5.0|Watched all 4 seasons in 3 days.  You'll be hooked.  Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul are amazing in this show.  I watched Brian on Malcom in the Middle and Aaron on Big Love and couldn't see the two of them in these roles, but now I can't see them any other way.  Perfect work - I'm watching more and more on AMC.
B00466HN86|5.0|We saw \\"Courageous\\" this afternoon and are still talking about it. What a great, motivating storyline. It's a call for action for men and families and it could just start a revolution. We laughed, we cried, laughed some, cried some more. There were some really intense action scenes, too. We can't wait until it's out of DVD.

B002ZG97EC|4.0|I got this movie on a whim when the blu ray had ended up in the bargain bins, I had avoided it for a while due to the movie getting very bad reviews here in Norway, but now I regret not seeing it sooner. Despicable Me is about a super villain named Gru. Now our anti hero is over the peak, he is getting older and younger super villains with more outlandish gadgets and weapons are rising up to surpass him, the evil bank will no longer lend him money for his plots and life generally suck for Gru, enter three orphan girl which Gru adopts. (He needs them for his plot to make the world's biggest thefts though explaining in detail why would be to much of a spoiler.) Now Gru who used to delight in crushing children's dreams and steal candy from babies have to deal with being a single dad and the only help he have in the matter is a fellow mad scientist even nuttier than he is and a army of small, yellow creatures that serves as his evil minions.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that works for everyone. Me and my hubby sat watching it and laughed until we gasped for breath, there is definitely enough there for adults to like, all from a plot that any comic book geek would love (who would not love to see any given super villain suddenly having to function as a father for three little girls?) to little hints here and there that go right over the heads of the kiddies but which is very amusing for the adults. At the same time the plot is easy to follow, goofy and the characters have allot of charm, this really is a movie the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />Animation wise this movie is passable, it get the job done, it is definitely not bad but the characters do look like plastic and this movie just do not live up to the standards set by Dreamworks and Pixar and this is the only reason Despicable Me do not get a 5 rating from me, it looks like it was produced ten years ago, computer animation have gotten so much further since then, however let me say again that the animation is not bad, and for many this would not be an issue at all. The rest of the production, voice acting, music, sound effects, all of it is top notch.<br /><br />Despicable Me is a cute and charming movie about a villain who learns how to love. I really enjoy this movie and I think it would appeal to a wide variety of people, this movie is intended for children but it is definitely not only for children. This is a good addition to the whole superheroes and supervillains taken out of their element theme that have been going on as of late and I do warmly recommend it.or many this would not be an issue at all.

B004SBBDB2|1.0|Well....I'm bummed.  I just spent an hour plugging cords in my TV, my iPad, my iPod Touch...and the best I could do was to get my iPad to play some scratchy video from Netflix on my TV.  And oddly enough, one random Glee song.  Hulu wouldn't come up at all, I couldn't get any photos to appear and my iPod Touch didn't even seem to make a connection.  I tried every component section of my HDTV (and yes - that 2 identical red plugs thing is frustrating) - and never got this cord to work.<br /><br />And I REALLY wanted this to work.  I am trying to lay the groundwork for breaking up with Netflix, Quikster - whatever they are calling it today.  Can I mention how crazy that company is?  They were fabulous - I was a completely satisfied customer...until they decided they didn't really like having customers anymore...  So I want to use Hulu and maybe the Amazon video/TV thing...and this cord was going to help me out.  But there were no instructions included, no online instructions that are easily found...<br /><br />I am sure, since I own the thing, that I will try hooking this up again...but so far, I am very disappointed.
B005F96URI|3.0|First off all let me get a pet peeve about how this movie is presented out of the way. Now this is presented as a western/Martial Arts science fiction film, well there is nothing science fiction about this movie, it seams the term science fiction is slapped on anything a little out of the ordinary these days. Bunraku takes place in a world where guns have been outlawed so everyone fights with swords, knives and fists, this is a interesting premise that set the movie up for some great fight scenes but it do not make it science fiction.<br /><br />Bunrako is a stylized movie that tried to me a mix of a comic book in movie format and a homage to German Expressionism, now this sounds like a odd mix but it works quite well, the visuals of this movie is stunning and it frames the story very well, or to put it in another way had it not been for the stylized atmosphere and visuals this movie would have been rather dull, as it is however Bunrako takes you on a joyride which is pure goodness for the eyes.<br /><br />The plot of Bunrako is something like this, two men, a drifter and a Japanese Martial Artist comes to a small town that is terrorized by a gang leader named The Woodcutter and his nine killers. Soon our two heroes join up with a local bartender and go after the Woodcutter and his organization for various personal reasons. The plot of this movie is pretty thin and it really fails to capture much interest for me, however the characters and the nicely choreographed fight scenes more than makes up for it. Now let us be honest, this is not a movie you watch if you want a deep and involving storyline, this is the kind of movie you put on when you just want to be entertained by mindless action and people chopping one another's heads off, and this movie give you moping drifters with a sad past, heroic Martial Artists, pretty women, cookie cutter evil villains and enough action to fill all the needs of a popcorn, pizza and a movie night with your friends.<br /><br />Now one problem I have with this movie is that at times it try so hard to be edgy that it get silly. I get for example that in a movie like this acting have to be over the top, that is part of the style, however there is a fine line where being stylized end and being annoying stars and this movie is over that line a few times. I do however love the details in this film, everything is focused on making it feel like a comic book come to life, from the subtitles when the characters speaks Japanese looking like comic book text boxes to the characters appearances, and the movie even hits at computer games as well with a chase scene having pinball sounds and the whole taking down the killers ones by one and having them crossed of the list and slowing working towards the Woodcutter as the main boss, Bunrako is one geeky little gift box.<br /><br />I recommend this movie as a rent, the thin story and the fact that the movie drags on that story for nearly two hours without enough material is a ptoblem and also unless you like the style of the movie it falls flat as that is all it got, for those reasons I recommend rent over buy unless you can get it cheap. I however think Bunrako is worth at least being watched once.ie is that at times it try so hard to be edgy that it get silly.

B003Y3BSSS|3.0|Chloe Thurlow is a very fine writer, a brilliant prose stylist.  As a travelogue and philosophical coming of age story, Girl Trade is a pleasure for the literate reader.   Unfortunately (since this is billed as erotica) I didn't find it tantalizing or arousing, nor was the story compelling or even suspenseful after the first few chapters. I took far more  pleasure reading about the places and mapping the main character's solipsism than from any of the sexual scenes.   How odd, in fact, that the very physical, sensual, leisurely descriptions of the island, the fortress, the desert did not extend to the sexual scenes. They seemed strangely abrupt, disembodied and abbreviated - just necessary, unavoidable steps that document Chengi's ever-narrowing world. That is usually a key piece in any sexual slavery story, and it's done with almost too much buttery smoothness here -- which makes it feel so passive: no resistance or ambivalence, no gut fear that churns into arousal. No conflict.  Even the other characters were merely minor moons rotating around Chengi's increasingly perfect self-absorption. There was no solidity or texture to them (other than the old beachcomber perhaps), and no sense of connection for good or ill. How could such pale figures cause harm or pleasure to anyone? How could they come to mean anything to her, or to the reader?  And, ultimately, how can it be erotic when it's essentially all mental masturbation?
B004I2K4DY|3.0|As a Les Misaholic I was so excited to hear PBS would be again broadcasting this concert. Eagerly I tuned in but in the end I was left highly disappointed. The cast of 1995's special truly was the \\"dream\\" cast and with reason. Colm Wilkinson is without a doubt the best ValJean in the show's history, his chemistry with Phillip Quast is unmatched. It was so great to see Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway back as \\"the T's\\" though. Many slammed their performance from 95 but I found it most enjoyable, providing the comic relief these characters are. Lea Salonga, what can I say? First off, I LOVE Lea, but to cast her as Fantine was a bad call. Lea is without a doubt most the most well known and the best Eponine and to take her away from that role, I just don't know. Ruthie Henshall is the best Fantine (sorry to the Patti LuPone fans). And now to Nick Jonas, were producers thinking this was the only way they could sell tickets? Yes he looks the part of Marius but he can't hold a candle to Michael Ball (\\"Empty Chairs\\" is a prime example). Again, I don't know what the motives were there.  While I don't own this, I felt as a fan of the show I had to review it. You are much better off getting the 10th Anniversary concert from Royal Albert!
1592332803|5.0|Out of my 10-12 vegan cook/baking books this one is hands down the best. Every single recipe has worked perfectly and turned out either completely wonderful or devastatingly delicious! I didn't buy it off Amazon - I hadn't converted to Amazon yet but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to recommend this book and rave about its consistently awesome reliability, diverse selections, and information on vegan baking ingredients and options. LOVE LOVE LOVE The Joy of Vegan Baking!!! ps. In response to some of the lesser reviews: I'm not vegan, I don't know the author, I don't get nor ever will get paid to endorse this book, its just simply been outstandingly successful for me. Baffled at and genuinely disappointed for those with less than an excellent experience. Still thoroughly recommend!
B004X4RU9I|5.0|Not only was this better than the first, it was probably the only movie in which I literally jumped up and started clapping. But that was at the end. In the middle when IP Man is earning his right to run a school (by fighting his equal on a table... freaking brilliant), I remembered thinking, \\"this is probably the best fight scene I've ever seen.\\" For a martial arts movie, I was pretty impressed with the character development; one of the bad guys becomes a good guy. It is certainly the only movie that inspired me enough to write a review. Watch it, it's fantastic.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I just started watching this show again. I love it and so does my daughter. This is a great show a cross between James Bond and Mr. Wizard. Very little blood and gore; just really intelligent ideas.<br /><br />There handiwork of Terry Nation is all over it. The man who invented the Daleks and Blake's 7. I had the pleasure of meeting him in person. Anderson does a perfect job portraying the character. I am not sure who is he supposed to work for. No matter who cares probably the same people as Mission Impossible :-)<br /><br />The stories are really intelligent. Makes you realize a bit of cleverness goes a long way. Great deal of fun and at this price how could you go wrong?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Well, if you're one of the millions of people that play ANY Angry Birds game, you already know how awesome this one is, just like the rest of them. The ONLY thing that sucks is the ads that get in the way of your next move, but this is what you get for the FREE version. I bought Angry Birds Rio for $.99 and it was SO worth it. It's only a dollar and it helps when you need to aim the birds up high to get a good move. **Angry Birds Addict** They just need to release new levels more often!
B005CW5E3E|5.0|I have been waiting for 20 years for an album like this from Johnny Winter. Like Eric Clapton and BB's album or the George Jones Bradley Barn Sessions, I knew there were some great artists out there who would love the chance to record with Johnny. After reading his autobiography (which I highly recommend) I understand why it had never happened. As I always suspected Teddy Slatus was worthless as a manager and had just used Johnny as a meal ticket. If you loved his blues albums from a few years ago, you will be pleasantly surprised. This is his best in quite a few years. His voice has improved since his last two albums and the guests were great.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This camera effects app is pretty cool, but I have a lot of these effects from other FREE apps. It does have some cool effects that others don't have, but I don't know if $2 is worth it.
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|I am a big fan of Demi, but I am disappointed by this album. It didn't sound like her at all. It was more \\"club music\\" with the occasional slow song. Don't get me wrong, she can sing anything, but I loved her singing rock. With that being said, I will still support her.
0062112430|5.0|The premise of this book was so interesting and it had been receiving so much hype that my expectations for it were very high. And believe me, it met them. Everything about this book was spot on, and it made it all the way into my number 3 spot for top ten books that I read in 2010!<br /><br />I really liked the main character Lena. I liked how she was kind of your average girl who did what she was told and never broke the rules, but that she had this underlying and hidden desire to be something else, someone who doesn't fit into the society's mould, someone who breaks the rules for what they believe in. As the book developped, this change in Lena became much more evident. She started to realize that maybe everything that the society controlled wasn't exactly benefitial for the people, and she also learned of the lies that the society had been feeding them. Through the course of the book, Lena changed into a completley new person, the type of person that was only hidden inside of her at the beginning of the book.<br /><br />This next character, Alex, had a huge influence on the change that Lena made throughout the book. Without him, she never would have realized what was really going on or have had the courage to break the rules. From the start, Alex was a very mysterious character, leaving you asking yourself what his real story was. Although he works as a security guard, why is he constantly breaking the rules? Although he is supposed  to be \\"cured\\", how come he seems to be falling in love? It was things like that that made him a rather mysterious and very interesting character, and as the story went on and these questions were answered, his character became even more interesting. I found Alex to be so sweet, gentle and loving and really began to fall in love with him myself. He is probably one of my favourite male charcters that I've been introduced to in a long while.<br /><br />Lena's best friend, Hana, also played a huge roll in Lena's change throughout the book. Lena and Hana had been best friends for a very long time, but when Lena learns something about Hana, she feels like she doesn't even know her anymore. As she begins to become more deeply immersed in what Hana is doing, she realises why Hana made the choices that she did. Hana probably played the most important roll in Lena's change, in her breaking out of society's mould, because without Hana's first little push, without her first making Lena break one little rule, Lena probably would have never been exposed to anthing outside of what she had always been told.<br /><br />The plot of this book was gripping and infatuating. It had me up reading until my eyelids could not possibly stay open any longer and I ended up falling asleep in the early hours of the morning still clutching this book in my hands. The dystopian genre is very thought provoking, and the idea of a society in which love is considered a curable disease was very interesting to me.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's writting is beautiful. I really became emotionally connected to both the characters and the story, and when written word can provoke such a deep, emotional response from me, it's amazing. This book is probably one that will call for a box of tissues, so just be prepared.<br /><br />All in all, I loved everything about this book. The characters, the plot, the writing. All perfect. I'm so glad that this book is part of a series and I can't wait for the next book, especially after the heart-wrenching cliff-hanger that we were left with during the final pages of this book.

0439023513|5.0|This book absolutely blew my mind! I'd been counting down the days until the release day of this books for months, and I was not disappointed with it!<br /><br />Every single book in the Hunger Games Trilogy has been amazing, but this book just took this series to a whole other level for me. The depth in which Katniss' emotions are explored is unbelievable, but completely draining. By the time that I finished reading this book, I felt almost zombie-like, I was in complete emotional-overload and didn't know how to process all of the emotions that I was feeling. I have never in my life read a book that had the ability to make me feel so much. It's been about a week and a half since I finished the book and I still don't have the exact words to describe how deeply this book got to me.<br /><br />And it wasn't just Katniss who we got to know in a deeper way, I feel like we got to see so many of the other characters this way. During all of the stress and fear and anger of the revolution and the war, I felt like some characters really began to show their true colours, who they really are. And some of the characters ended up being so much different then I thought they were, and not necessarily in a good way. I don't want to spoil the book for any of the people who haven't read it yet, but I feel like one character in particular ended up being a completely different person in the end. I felt like this character ended up being a bit hypocritical in their actions by becoming everything that they once hated.<br /><br />At the very beginning of the book, there isn't really a whole lot of action, but the lack of action doesn't last for long. Once the action got started, I don't think that it ever really ended until the second last chapter. It was fast-paced  and impossible to put down (And I mean that literally. I was carting it around everywhere with me until I finished it. We had quite a lovely dinner together.), I just kept reading and reading because I had to find out what happened next.<br /><br />In alot of books, you can easily predict what's going to happen next, but with this book I couldn't do that. Oh, I would try, I'd think that I knew exactly what was coming next, but then I would be blind-sided when something completely different would happen. I think that the ability to keep the readers on their toes and unable to predict exactly what's going to happen next it definitly a quality that I value in a book.<br /><br />Like I said before, I have never been so emotionaly affected by a book before. This book made me laugh, made me cry and made me furious. Mostly cry. I've always been the type to shed a tear of two when reading an emotional part in a book, but I have never really cried while reading a book. Until now. The depth at which we got to know the characters mixed in with all the heartbreaking deaths just pushed me over the edge, to the point where I had to take a moment to let myself cry and just let everything, all that this book was causing me to feel, out.<br /><br />I really can't get into a huge in-depth review without revealing any spoilers and it wouldn't be right to spoil anything about a book for someone else, especially not this book. This is a book that you have to experience for yourself.<br /><br />If you haven't read Mockingjay yet, I don't think that you will be disappointed. Just be prepared to deal with all the raw emotions in this book. I wish that I had known to mentally prepare myself for it. And to have had a box of tissues within reaching distance.<br /><br />And if you haven't read The Hunger Games, you have too. I'm at a loss for words for how to describe how amazing this whole series is!, you can easily predict what's going to happen next, but with this book I couldn't do that. Oh, I would try, I'd think that I knew exactly what was coming next, but then I would be blind-sided when something completely different would happen.

B0037QGS0A|5.0|Although this was supposedly a remake of the French film \\"Nathalie,\\" the ending was a lot different. This ending was based on Freud's published case history, *The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman:*     [...]    Most professional critics don't like the ending of \\"Chloe\\" because they think it's a stereotypical appeasement of the American audience's prudish desire to see sexual promiscuity punished.     Do not be deceived. One day I was reading a criticism by la de dah film critic Frank LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle.  He liked the movie, but he too objected to the ending on the same grounds, so I showed him the above website to see what he thought, but he didn't buy it.  However, the similarities were compelling enough to where he forwarded my e-mail to the script writer, Erin Cressida-Wilson, who informed him that she never heard of Freud, although the similarities were \\"VERY interesting.\\"  So, I had to admit I was wrong.  However, I decided to make sure by showing the similarities to Atom Egoyan who e-mailed me back with this:  \\"Although I am familiar with Freud's famous case history, I did not discuss it with Erin Cressida-Wilson.\\"      I figured that was it, until one day Egoyan made a public announcement that it was he who wrote the ending.  The original ending had Liam Neeson coming home and killing Chloe, and Egoyan didn't like it. So he changed it.     I laughed and laughed.  Apparently Cressida-Wilson contacted Egoyan after LaSalle spilled the beans on him and gave him holy hell and demanded he admit to the world the ending was his idea.  Women in California tend to hate Freud. LOL!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have read the book; however, I am visually impaired and had to get a magnifier to put over the small print on the pages. Eventually I made it through it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I lived during that time in New Orleans and subsequently went to work for the anti-poverty program in Baton Rouge to be part of a change.  Presently I live in Cheraw, SC, and we have no local theaters for me to see the movie. I can hardly wait for my DVD to be shipped so I can watch it over and over.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|after reading the reviews I wasn't sure if I should buy it or not but since it was on sale for $0.99 I figured what did I have to loose and I'm I did.<br /><br />Idk why it has so many bad reviews but I have not had any problems with the game at all. The graphics can be better in my opinion with the technology we have but they are not crappie like the other reviews are saying.<br /><br />Overall it is a fun game if you like uno and is worth what I spent on it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Seems to me that many of King's newer works are kind of \\"write by numbers\\" sort of books and stories. It's almost like there is a template that he writes by: pre-pubescent boy angst, clueless grown ups, some sort of monster lurking that only kids can recognize and then kids save the day....   I give the plot one star, but love King's style of writing and character development enough to give that portion 5 stars, thus the average of 3 stars.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I made the mistake of buying this version. But luckily I didn't open it once I got home, so I was able to return it today. I'm not going to fall for the same money trap again(Avatar).  I'll just wait a few months and get the Special Edition one with all the extra features.  Now me just ranting here for a bit. But what the hell Paramount, I know times are tough for everyone but do you have to do this to us. Trying to rip off the loyal customers is not good business.

B004NSULHM|5.0|This album is very different from most of Radiohead's previous albums.   Those expecting the sound from The Bends, OK Computer, etc will be disappointed, but if you are open to Radiohead going down different musical avenues then this album will be a great item to add to your collection.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was a little unsure if I wanted to purchase this.  But I took a chance and did anyway.  The boyfriend and I sat through all 13 or so hours of films.  The High Definition for all 6 was superb, there wasn't too much change to the original films and I am 100% satisfied. I think George Lucas did just enough small changes perfectly.  Of course all of the die hard fans are a little ticked off, but they're not big enough changes to turn me away.  I still enjoyed them just as much as the originals and did not feel my money went to waste.  Thumbs up!!
B000063TE5|5.0|There are so many great things about this record, about the story of Wilco during this period, and the mark it has left on the world. After Wilco released this record it challenged other bands to broaden their horizons, experiment more. Wilco had transformed from the mediocre alt-country band that could never surpass the reach of Uncle Tupelo to the band everyone loved. The only band that my musician friends loved and their sorority girl-friends could \\"suffer\\" through in between the Missy Elliot and Usher plaguing the radio waves. Its funny, at least one of those girls used \\"Jesus Etc.\\" in her Wedding. I love this record perfect amount of experimentation, great writing although I must admit some of the lyrics when I first heard this record were non-sensical at time even stupid. Sadly those lyrics  still stick out as bad but, I'm willing to over look them considering the strength of the album as a whole. I often wonder what the follow up (A Ghost is Born) would have been like if Jay Bennett was still in the band because, to me at least A Ghost Was Born after this record Wilco lost their life. They are fine to listen to now in the background softly ignoring most if not all words but YHF is a classic.  Its ironic to me I love the vinyl version of their most lo-fi record. All of their later records are sonically \\"better\\" but this is absolutely beautiful on vinyl.
0345027507|5.0|When I came to Childhood's End I had a good basis of knowledge of other science fiction works and thus it was thrilling for me to find that this book is a fundamental part of the roots from which the rest of science fiction has sprung. Readers will see strong similarities to V, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Tripods Trilogy and many other popular works - here is the original genesis of several pop sci fi concepts.<br /><br />While similar to other works, Clarke's perhaps greatest achievement is the ability to generate thought on a variety of topics. This is a thinking book. As it was written prior to the space race, it's fascinating to see what Clarke anticipates in that regard. Also expect wonderful descriptions of other planets, splendid character development and fun predictions about modern life that don't quite live up to what we actually have around us today.<br /><br />A jaunty must-read for science fiction enthusiasts.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I was skeptical about this because of the price and the fact that it has to lay on your head. But im glad i was wrong because these are great! I can run, stretch and even clean with these. I hate the other kind that just \\"plug\\" in your ear because they always come off and kill my workout. Not only do these stay in place but the sound is really good as well!
0307271862|5.0|Events of America's expansion in the United States in the late 1800's cause retribution torture and execution of families in Sweden almost 200 years later.  Why does the diary of a Chinese peasant cause a tragedy of unknown proportions in a country half way round the world.  Why were police willing to believe the crime way solved when only a judge on sick leave continue to pull the loose thread of truth to the end?  Henning Mankell once again weaves elements of time with a new female heroine taking place of Kurt Wallander.  A read that will keep you awake into the wee hours.
1594744769|5.0|awesome book. Couldnt put it down. Beautiful use of old photos as another way to help tell the story. and i loved that the main character was from my aunt's town in florida! good job ransom on your first book.
B0052GACNM|3.0|I eagerly awaited DUETS II. The choices, the guest artists - it was all too good to be true.<br /><br />Yet, after several listenings, I find it a surprisingly flat set of arrangements. Now, don't get me wrong, Tony Bennett tries and he does quite well with the challenge at hand. His selections are classic and his voice is still very, very good and admirably strong. Rather, I found it was the \\"guests\\" that left something to be desired.<br /><br />In cases like the much anticipated Lady GaGa duet on THE LADY IS A TRAMP, although she is coy and quite funny, it, like most of the numbers, just doesn't live up to either its potential or to other versions of the song.  SPEAK LOW, one of the loveliest tunes ever written, gains nothing from Norah Jones' performance.  In fact, it seems that on most of the numbers, Mr. Bennett is left almost to fend for himself.  If you don't believe me, listen to BLUE VELVET. His voice is still strong and clear. But k.d. lang just seems to be painting by the numbers.<br /><br />This is not a bad recording, if anything it deserves praise for attempting something quite as diverse as it is. But the other performers were either intimadated by Tony Bennett or just called in their performances.

B0058VW36U|5.0|After reading reviews I thought I would give this game a try.  Once I launched the game I can not put down. This is a great game both in cosmetics and actual game play.
0545265355|5.0|Could not stop reading it... The main character, Katniss did get a bit annoying with her behavior at some points. However, I still love this series. I also like the ending - as happy as it could be considering all that has happened.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I really don't understand why amazon.co.uk is offering the same set, more or less, for much less money *AND* they are offering the 3D version as well. Frankly, this would not be as big a franchise without US money and yet we are the ones getting nickled and dimed! No sooner will this less than stellar version be released before WB re-releases another set for more money! Two stars just because of the packaging and pricing. The price has *increased* $10 since the pre-order started.
B004W648Y2|4.0|Won't go into a long review as the previous four reviewers do a great job in that regard. Most happy with this package, but in comparing this with my previous Castle release, can anyone tell why \\"King Kong\\" wasn't included here? In checking session dates, it was recorded at the same time as the majority of this album. Looking forward to more Kinks Deluxe packages!
B005CM9DX6|1.0|If you are a big fan of Opeth like I am save your money.  I agree with most of the opions on this site, this CD bites.  I read a lot of reviews on line praising the album on the direction the band took.  The direction was down.  Mikael Åkerfeldt really blew it.  Now I see why one of the musicians in the band left in the middle of recording this waste.  At least he had the nads to stand up and say what he thought about it.  There is a lot of dead air and wasted time in this recording, sounds like they were trying to fill in time for this dribble.  The next time I purchase a CD from Opeth I will be sure and listen to it first.  I feel robbed for listening and paying for this.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Lets forget for a moment how beautiful a well played cellos can sound.  Lets also forget SIR Elton John is taking them on his tour, and is saying they are really, really good.  Just close your eyes, and listen. (You can do that on youtube for free, they have official videos there).  Their renditions of Viva la Vida almost brings tears to my eyes, so beautiful. And that is NOT the best song on the album.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I just finished The Affair, and was once again very pleased.  Love Reacher and his way of handling all situations!  Now that I know who will play this character on screen, I am so disappointed!  Cannot for one second even think of Tom Cruise being Jack Reacher.  This man is so powerful and strong - Cruise could fit in his 'watch' pocket!  But, I thought, I don't have to go tot he movie I will just read the books and keep Reacher alive in my mind's eye.  Reading The Affair takes you back to how Reacher starts his journey - brings you a look at how he 'begins', what drove him to leave and travel around the country.  You finally get to meet Reacher when he was in the service and get a little glimpse of the inside of his soul, not much, but a little bit of what makes up the man - his attitude toward his country and a little of his heart.  Meeting Reacher was a little gift from Lee Child to his readers.  This is a book no true Reacher reader will be sorry to read, unless you like to read books more than one sitting - this is one you can't put down!
B0017VG69U|5.0|I have this DvD series and it didn't cost 65 dollars, I believe some of the prices are a little steep especially when you consider the financial state of the country. Please take this in consideration when you are pricing these items, people like myself really want them, but it is very hard to purchase at these prices.
B000003JBJ|5.0|It's true this album did sort of start a movement. But the movement started while the music that inspired was still in it's first run. It's sort of an interesting story in the end. Some of the members of the Brit Funk band Light Of Worlds,including guitarist Jean Paul Maunick decided to put together a new and somewhat anonymous band who called themselves (quite appropriately) Incognito. This solved the problem of revolving door personnel that some bands faced,especially during the funk/R&B unfriendly early 80's pop radio/record buying scene and allowed for the band to become very studiocentric. The question is why would anyone want acid jazz before it even needed to exist? Well for one thing all that was really being done here was the re introduction of the jazz-funk genre into the than burgeoning Brit funk scene. Pretty soon bands such as Level 42 would be mining this same territory. Right around the same time really. But during 1980 and 1981 when this album was recorded the UK jazz-funk scene this was a part of was still somewhat in the trial and error stages. But for those familiar with the bands 90's comeback this album may come as something of a surprise.<br /><br />  Amending the ten track album with the 1980 songs \\"Parisienne Girl\\" and \\"Summers Ended\\" (but for some reason omitting the excellent single \\"North London Boy\\",supposedly a tribute to Spandau Ballet) this album is nontheless has a vital groove throughout. Primarily devoted to uptempo music this album has contains some of the HARD CORE FUNK Incognito ever put to wax. With the space funk synths of \\"Shine On\\" to the deeply rhythmic,late 70's Herbie Hancock like \\"Interference\\" and the percussive \\"Incognito\\"  we have a band not only capable of playing excellent jazz-funk of course but also of exploring every subgenre it has to offer as well. Other numbers such as \\"The Smile Of A Child\\" feature vocals. And especially on the chugging Becker/Fagen-like \\"Why Won't You Believe Me\\" the very un poppy and often untrained sounding singing gives it more the feeling of an instrumental element than a vocal element. After this album Incognito would not appear for another decade until the appearance of their 1991 release [[ASIN:B0000046KU Inside Life]]. Soon after with the edition of singer Maysa Leak the had somewhat more of an identity. But based on music alone this album is definitely a winner on the funk end of things.ned sounding singing gives it more the feeling of an instrumental element than a vocal element.

B00009ATIX|4.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />I saw this movie several years ago, but remember little about it.  I'm not sure why.  Tired, bored, drunk?  Who knows? I decided to give it another try. The film has great credentials.  Steven Soderberg directs, James Cameron and Jon Landau produce, George Clooney stars.  And it takes large cojones to take on Lem's tome and to remake Tarkovsky's critically acclaimed film.<br /><br />Soderberg (\\"Oceans 12 & 13, Che\\") begins by chopping off most of the beginning sequence and I say good riddance.  We see glimpses of Chris Kelvin (Clooney) with his patients and he seems somewhat distant and lonely.  His friend Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) calls him from the space station and asks him to come and help close it down due to strange events he can't talk about over the airwaves.  Kelvin asks the government agents why they don't send in a security team.  They reply, they did.  What happened?  They disappeared.  Huh?<br /><br />So Kelvin goes anyway...and by himself!  Now really, how plausible is that?  Now that's out of the way, Soderberg's vision of the trip itself is beautifully filmed, with great color and impressive CGI.  He spends more time with the beauty of space than with the beauty of Earth. This is a bit of a reversal from Tarkovsky's film.  Once Kelvin arrives he isn't met by anyone and stumbles upon a cold storage locker where his friend lies dead.<br /><br />Searching the station, he finds 2 crew members.  A hyperactive Snow, played with initial craziness by Jeremy Davies (\\"Lost\\", \\"Justified\\") and a more solemn Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis).  They talk of \\"visitors\\" but Kelvin isn't convinced.  At least not until he sleeps.  He dreams of his life with his now dead wife Rheya.  At first we don't know what happened but we can tell Kelvin feels guilty.  When he awakes, Rheya is in bed with him.  Natascha McElhone (\\"Californication\\") brings her British accent and high cheekbones to the role and is very good.<br /><br />The film of course borrows from Tarkovsky but also \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"THX 1138\\" and \\"2001\\".  It is this last film that I was reminded of most.  Not only because of the theme, but the desolation, the loneliness and the stark but beautiful images.  The acting is solid all the way around and Clooney in particular works hard in one of his best performances.  I should also mention that Cliff Martinez provides a terrific soundtrack.<br /><br />The movie isn't for everyone.  It is slow.  It focuses primarily on the relationship between Kelvin and Rheya, both in dream visions and the \\"visitor\\" recreation.  There are many unanswered questions about what's real and what isn't, not only in the film but in the universe which we all live...and die.  Cue the \\"Twilight Zone\\" music.ws from Tarkovsky but also \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"THX 1138\\" and \\"2001\\".  It is this last film that I was reminded of most.

B005RK6EUS|5.0|Very cool episode, yes i agree that it could have been a longer finale to really sum up some plot points. But thats not how doctor who works. Season seven will certainly continue the thread. And of course they left you wanting more. Argh no i have to wait till next year!! Still best show ever!
B005G4TJI4|1.0|No way, sorry, and I am not a negative nanny, this was just bad from start to (long) finish.  It just overly cranks everything up, that's about it, the usual pushing the limits, raising the bar, take it to the next level, don't you get tired of these sayings, same for the movie.  It keeps things going with over dramatized lame acting, a vague storyline with very little interesting, and hard to follow even if there is something there to follow, even my wife said \\"that does not make sense\\" \\"so much is not believable, even stupid\\" (my wife never talks like that), and so much busy, loud and fast special effects action to keep your brain overloaded/confused so it cannot tell these many downfalls.  And no one will believe the gorgeous lady opposite would be at all interested in the sissy screaming, bumbling, bozo hero lead Witless Wickie, come on!  To add conflict, or filler to the movie we need an annoying type to mess things up and give us someone to hate, I know lets pick on a politician type, we all love to hate them, but we did that the last time with a man, so, let's do a woman this time, wow, brilliant!  Seriously wonder if anyone will ever have anything to quote or recall to a friend from this movie (like Avatar, other than unobtainium; that's its, whoopee!), like a good move does.  The robot fights (taking it to the next level) now has a level of gore to it, a bit horrific, why?  Leonard Nimoy voice is too well known from Star Trek (and many other appearances) and with just coming back in the last Star Trek of 2009, he cannot be something else, just too weird, messes it up big time!  The only thing enjoyable, fun or interesting, the (now) 2  little pet robots (where did the second one come from? no idea, my point with the movie all through it, rambles meaninglessly), they are funny and the only believable heroes in it (other than their sort-of cut short swear words when they commandeer a space ship, but decency and any level of good practice or censorship left years ago)!  And I can't believe I am saying it, but John Turturro as the super secret government agency nerd its actually better than the rest of the characters in the movie.  Oh yea, and the disc is a movie, nothing else, but I could not tolerate anymore punishment!ars ago)!

B004I654WQ|5.0|Only wish this came in 3D.  Really great Blu-ray/DVD.  Gave it to my grandson and it was almost impossible to pry him away from watching it.  Never say anyone want to watch a DVD over and over again.  Made my heart feel great.  Anyway, great DVD.  Looking forward to getting the 3Blu-Ray version when it comes out.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great app! Beautiful and challenging. Love the music too. This game is like Unblock Me but much better. The awards are a nice touch.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|I admit it. I fell victim to Starbucks.  I bought this CD standing in line at Starbucks, and as soon as I got out to the car, I looked at it and said \\"What were you thinking?\\".  But I had just paid too much for it to ignore it, so I put it in the player.  And at first, I was disappointed.  I had heard Hugh Laurie play as part of his character on Jeeves and Wooster (a wonderful show)--he would toss off wonderful renditions of jazz/ragtime influenced pieces from the 20's and 30's.  He really is a talented pianist, and his voice was pleasant in the show.  Here, his voice is much rougher, and--what?  He's playing New Orleans Jazz?  Really?  Yes.  Really.  And guess what--after the initial shock was gone, after I read the liner notes and realized how much he truly loved this music for music's sake, I loosened up, gave it another 2-3 listens, and started dancing in my seat as I drove.  I started playing it for my kids, who thought it was a blast.  I lent it to some friends.  I listened to it some more. And the more I listened, the more his voice grew on me, the more the songs were just fun, and the more I enjoyed it.  This will never be my \\"go to\\" NOJ album, but it is not a vanity project in the strictest sense of the word.  This is music by a musician who happens to be an actor as well.  It is music that he loves, he is supported by some VERY talented folk (like the sublime Dr. John) and his love for the music comes through.  Some of these songs I had never heard before, and I am grateful that I have now heard them.  I'm gonna keep this one on my shelf, pull it down now and again, and have myself a good time every time that I do.  Listen to a few of the samples before you buy--make sure you are really up for this--but if you are willing to take a chance on having a little fun, and you like New Orleans Jazz, then it is time (and money) well spent.
B003L77GRO|5.0|It's Dexter, what more can be said?  Seasons 1 - 4 left me begging for more.  Season 5 makes me anxious for the release of Dexter - Season 6.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|love this game on computer.  Stops after a level or two not force close just stops and gous to home screen. GS2 EPIC 4G TOUCH
B004J00QLU|1.0|SUCKS.  It kills everything EXCEPT for the Amazon App Store, DLNA and News, which CANNOT be killed at all (which I find to be self-serving and deceitful).  The Free version kills EVERYTHING, which makes it the better product, because it DOES kill everything (although you have to manually tap on it every so often, because every app tends to reopen itself within a few minutes).  I'm going to check out the $4.99 version on Adroid Market.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I've bought in a long time, this girl can really sing. It's so refreshing to hear someone with a unique voice. Her songs are written by herself and she sings them with much passion. She doesn't have to hide behind silly costumes, no studio voice here, sounds just as great live too. Hope she is around for a long time, looking forward to more.
0807014273|5.0|I read the book with literal meaning of title. Found something and I have not read other reviews much because I think lot of people get the point and they put forth better than me. Here is why I am writing the review. I think he (VF) was on his path to enlightenment and fell short in the form of logo therapy or other ideas. I used to dream of being a Messiah and had encounters with life twice where I was equally pinned on cross but all in my thoughts I knew I cannot bear the pain far less the thought so I am a mere mortal. Same way I cannot fathom the depth of concentration camps or what crystalizes out of it. Typically in India we have a philosophy which I found comes handy that when you are given pain then you also get the courage to with stand it.  When do you cross over to enlightenment is something  eluding me though it is not a per-requisite as far as I know.  Kabbalah scholars will also find the book intriguing and failing in spiritual goals which he (VF) should have somehow alluded.  Read this book with higher goal of finding meaning of life and you will find enough that time will be well spent.  We all salute those who live life bigger than us and we feel fortunate that we are reading it in a cozy chair vs. living it.
B005974C94|4.0|I was born in New Orleans and have always enjoyed traditional jazz. These 2 great talents have it down to a T. Thanks Eric and Wynton, you brought back some wonderful memories for me.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I was really enjoying this game.  I had 3 stars on all of the levels for the 1st 3 boxes (a little bit OCD).  My 5 year old also enjoys feeding candy to Omnom on some of the easier 1st box levels until she apparently somehow went into the Options and hit Reset (not knowing the meaning of that word).  Now, I don't blame her for this, she didn't really know what she was doing, but I do blame the game maker for making this too easy to do.  Please, if you read these reviews, add some kind of basic test to keep 5 year olds from resetting games.  Perhaps a type of captcha or even a simple math problem would have been enough to keep them from doing it.
B004ZQRFGM|4.0|I noticed this album when shopping for another artist.  After listening to samples, I decided to take a chance. I was not disappointed. She is right up there with the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|For only 2 bucks, this is worth its weight in gold.  RPG turn by turn fans, and space games will probably like.  The elite version definately worth it unlocks alot, and many upgrades to make to ship.  Has decent retro fell graphics, and pretty darn good in my option for a cellphone game.  I thought I would play an hour after dinner and it has turned into 5 now, found myself drawn in.  Highly recommend.  I have enjoyed the evening playing, and I am sure more to come, definately worth it, if enjoy space and turn by turn.  Time to torpedo and chew bubble gum.... but I am all out of gum lol
B003274QH6|3.0|This series was recommended by a friend.  I found that it is strange type of series.  I will buy season 2 and give the series a chance.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Video arived on time just as they said it would. no hassle, great email updates. As always a low great price.
B005D51JQQ|5.0|Great artist; great content; nice packaging...priced too high. I've noticed a trend towards price gouging on these career compilations. I will pass on this one until it is more affordable.
B0049VZ2UY|3.0|Wow, really disappointed in the picture quality of the Blu ray. Really grainy. Great show, but not worth the price of a Blu ray. Buy the DVD.
B004ZNAGNE|3.0|I now have 3 versions of DSOTM on disc: \\"Original Master Recording\\", the 30rd Anniversary issue, & now the Experience Version. Maybe my ears are shot from too much loud music over the years but I honestly don't hear any difference between these recordings. So why did I purchase this latest version? I wanted the live performance & I wanted to see if there was more interesting album art. I have a bootleg of a radio broadcast of a live performance of DSOTM & there's very little difference, either in the performance or the quality of the recording. The album art was underwhelming; there were no new photographs or liner notes.<br /><br />If I could do it all over again I'd save my money.
B005NA3B8U|4.0|This is a excellent port, but the controls aren't quite good enough for the difficulty. I find myself getting killed by enemies under my fingers. And please change the icon... it really does look bad.
B0052U59F4|4.0|This review may contain *spoilers*...<br /><br />Hmmm, where do I begin? I can reiterate what many reviewers have already commented on; books about BDSM are not usually \\"my thing\\", but with so many great recommendations I had to give it a try. This book was incredibly hot. The chemistry between Christian and Ana is instant and only gets better as the book progresses. The email exchanges were by far the best parts, to me. It allowed a very rare glimpse into the sweet, romantic side of Grey. Very rare indeed because he is such a tortured hero, both literally and figuratively.<br /><br />As I've already stated, this book is very hot and sexy. Definitely not for the faint of heart or easily embarrassed. It contains graphic language and sex. There's a particular bathroom scene that still makes me blush when I think of it!<br /><br />The reason I am only giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I grew tired of the constant lip biting, inner-goddess and references to Grey's \\"god-like\\" attractiveness. The language at times doesn't sound like a 21 year old recent college grad, either. I understand the author is not from America, but Ana is. I've never heard anyone I know refer to a baby stroller as a pram!<br /><br />Overall fantastic read, and I'm currently half-way finished with the sequel. Loving it as well!
159562015X|3.0|I liked this book, don't get me wrong... but it's not much of a book. It's more of an online test.   A couple of years ago, my friends kept hounding me to get this book. \\"OH, you're going to love it! You've got to get it! It's so amazing!\\" Perhaps I just suffered from over-hype.   I once heard of a corporate consultant who told businesses to buy it, throw away the book and just use the code to take the online test. I thought that was a pretty brash statement. But now I know why.   The \\"book\\" consists of a good intro/prologue that primes you for taking the test. It's well-written and makes some great points about how we respond to failure and focus on our strengths and weaknesses. About the moment I was cheering and felt we were gaining momentum, It abruptly stops and instructs you to go online and take the test before going any further. Taking the test was fine and took approximately 20 minutes. Afterward, you can read all about your top 5 strengths and even download PDF reports, which I liked.   When I went back to the book, I realized that it's only the printed version of what your strengths are once you've taken the test. Only, it's the entire library of traits, and since I had already read mine, the rest of the book was suddenly less interesting.    Aside from this deflated feeling about the book itself, I felt like the descriptions of my top 5 were insanely accurate in describing me. They articulated things about my personality that I had never been able to do before. So while the \\"book\\" part was kind of a letdown, I do feel the insight gained was well worth the price of admission.   Would I recommend this book? Yes! Absolutely. But I'd be sure to warn them it's mostly an online test and less of a book. :)
142311339X|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson series so much!!! And I love this one just the same! I recommend this to anyone who loves fiction, action, comedy, and fantasy!!!! If you read this you won't regret it!!!!!!! It is great for all ages!!!!!
B003K1EYM6|3.0|The adapter with the USB cable does not work with my camera!  Why is there no info anywhere about which cameras the kit works with and which ones it does not.  My iPad did not recognize my Kodak EasyShare C195.  So I wasted my time and my money trying to get it to work. The card adapter does work however.  So I'm stuck with half of my purchase which does not work but I paid for two!  Wish I could send one back.  Bad design; very poor and misleading description of products. Made it sound like it was sooooo easy to use.  Buyer Beware!
0061537969|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It gets kinda sad in parts but well worth the read. I'd recommand it highly.
1416511946|5.0|Oh.  My.  Gawd.  This is an EXCELLENT, and completely creative, book!! I hate to call it a book when it's actually a journal, but I felt it read like a book.  I could not put it down.  I was never a Motely Crue fan (truth be told, I was a die-hard heavy metal fan in the '80s, but I didn't listen to the guys who wore makeup...)but I am a Nikki Sixx fan now!  I recently started counseling drug addicts in a rehab facility and this book has not only helped me to understand what a heroin addict goes thru, but it has started some amazing conversations in group sessions.  All around, I love this book.  I love how it's written and I love the artwork.  I am glad to have this book as a part of my collection. Thanks, Nikki...
0545265355|4.0|First book is the best.  Overall lots of suspense.  Good story line.  But would not recommend for elementary age kids.  Good for middle schoolers due to the violence.  A parent should read it before the kids do to make personal parenting choice.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Couldn't get the app to work but flooded with full screen ads. SMH Rovio don't get sucked into the coporate rat race! It's not a good look.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I think you will especially like it if you grew up in the late 80's. One of my favorites of the year.
0670022411|5.0|I loved this book & can't wait for book 2 to come out! Great character development, lots of action, true romance. Really fun to read.
B0059R5Q08|5.0|The actors chosen were perfect. Mia was especially wonderful. Her performance brought tears to my eyes. This movie adaptation is simply lovely!
B004XANKVO|5.0|Have been searching for a good all around back pack for traveling. This the most flexible and durable one that i found for the price.  I like the different compartments and everything seemed to be very well thought out.  I took it on my first trip to Napa last week and it was a great travel bag as well as a day pack.  It has a great slot for the iPad and your laptop.  I really like the crush proof sunglass and cell phone pocket that is very assessable on the outside. I have broken countless sunglass this way and this was the kicker that made me pull the trigger on this bag. If you purchase it you will not be disappointed.  Good buy and value.
0385534639|5.0|Beautiful clockworks metaphor. A tightly wound timepiece. Nocturnal wonderment. Transcendent love. Morgenstern's imagination grabs you and brings you into her boundless world.

B004SBQGHS|1.0|2 or 3 updates ago birds stopped working many emails to their product support and still no reply fame has gone to their head it will be short lived they don't support customer customer will go elsewhere original droid incredible
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I like this app.  It's fun and challenging.  However I am only giving 4 stars because of the idiocy of the creators in policing when and how I get a hint.  It forces you to wait 5 minutes each time and even after that I can only get a hint. every 24 levels or something asinine.  I only play this less than 5 minutes at a time so I have been stuck on the same puzzle for several days with no options which makes me not want to play.  Creators have no business policing how I choose to play their game if I want a hint after 5 tries or whatever I should be able to do this.  Please update to remove the hint restrictions and i would give 5 stars.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|This is a beautiful true story about 3 young girls separated from their family due to segregation of the Aborigines in Australia.  The girls realize their fate, then escape and travel over 1200 miles.  The grit, determination, and strength of these girls is inspiring.  I definately think this is a must see family film.  Probably children 9+ would most enjoy.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't understand the low rating for this book. I was just as upset as anyone else that it took so long for this book to come out. Maybe the reviewers were taking out their frustrations for the wait by criticizing this book. Anyway on to my review. I think this is a great series and this book was right up there with the other books in the series. If you have enjoyed the series so far, you will love this book. I decided not to reread the previous books. I was able to follow the storyline and remember the characters just fine. George RR Martin's writing is superb. He gives you just the right amount of description without boring you with too much detail. Also he continues to advance the story in this book. This series is on par with the first three books of<br />\\"the wheel of time\\" series in my opinion. I couldn't put this book down.  Now I'm going to read the other reviews to try to see why others graded it so low.
B005ELZKWS|1.0|Unfotunately this CD is very disappointing. It comes across as an effort to put out product and make some money by some very talented musicians who have nothing to say. It is well recorded and produced but the tunes are boring and the lyrics are meanignless and shallow. It really comes across as a recording by some rich, lazy, fat musicians who have lots of guitars, free time and money.
B003ASLJKO|5.0|This movie has some rawness and grit, interesting story line, plot, and sub-plots, with Eastwood as a tough no-nonsense detective, Speer, and Reynolds as an ex-cop and Private Eye, Murphy, who butt heads with each other, in Prohibition-era 1933 (last year of Prohibition, in fact), but team up to investigate mob murder and corruption.  It also has some funny lines and wittiness.  And of course, Eastwood, with his intensity, as well as his piano playing, is in true form as usual. This movie has been under-rated by many, and appreciated by few, but it's a true mid-1980's gem, with good music, drama, and sass.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my Atrix 4G !! So addictive and fun to play. Hopefully the developer will come out with more levels and keep Crazy Dave crazier than ever haha
B0052RDHTM|1.0|Let's see...I can pay $12 to have this read to me, or $19 if I want to read my own electronic copy.  With an audio book, the cost of the CD plus the creation of the audio is in addition to what the publisher is willing to accept for the base material.  So it's pretty clear this is not about charging a fair price, since the audio price is so much less.  They are just testing the market to see how much they can gouge readers.  I chose to just buy a used physical copy for $6 from Goodwill.    When I'm done, I'll donate it and take a $6 tax write off.  If my Kindle keeps sitting on the shelf because it costs more to use it than to buy a physical book, the Kindle's going back.
1932100660|5.0|I switched to a vegan diet after watching FoK and reading the china study. I feel great and i greatly enjoy the food i eat. Primarily because i live in Thailand which has already a huge amount of delicious and healthy food, and all of these foods can be ordered or cooked in a vegetarian way (which means automatically vegan as we don't use milk here too much anyway). So there is a lot of choice of very yummy food available.<br /><br />Love the food, love the health benefits and don't miss anything at all. Thanks Mr. Campbell!
0307477479|5.0|After hearing Ms. Egan speak about writing at the National Book Festival, I was inspired to read A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD. It's really wonderful--a true tour de force of narrative structure and extremely memorable characters. It swerves dazzlingly in time from the San Francisco punk rock scene of the early 1980s into the present; and finally into a future New York City strangled by social media and global warming. While some have derided the chapter composed in PowerPoint as a gimmick, I thought it worked well.<br /><br />I know there has been discussion whether GOON SQUAD is a novel or a clever collection of interlocked short stories. To my mind, it's both. While each story stands on its own (as Egan intended), there's a sense of elegiac loss permeating the book that ties everything together as a novel. Ultimately, GOOD SQUAD is a bittersweet Proustian meditation on the ravages of time. Highly recommended.
0553801473|1.0|The plot doesn't move, it creeps in fits and starts.  I enjoyed Books 1-3 but Books 4 & 5 are long, hard slogs of Martin describing banners, castles, roads, religions, family histories, boats, clothing, et cetera ad infinitum, broken briefly and rarely with action.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|This is an excellent blu-ray movie (I have seen it over 10 times with my kids and I still love it). The seller is also the best - when I saw this movie selling for this very low price, I could not believe that it was blu-ray but I do believe it now (local stores claim to have lowest prices and they are selling it for twice the price!!!!!!!!!! what a joke)
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Well constructed comedy/drama with unusual plot twists, excellent character  developement. A married businessman finds himself in an uninspired rut and decides to secretly  take dance lessons from a struggling studio. Humor and pathos combine in an uplifting story  of individual determination and personal victories.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I felt misled by the description of this Blu-ray release. The product description states: \\"Star Wars: The Original Trilogy on Blu-ray.\\" I was hoping to finally own the original trilogy on digital format, but was angered to discover these are the newer versions with distracting modifications added several years later.  I would like to blame George Lucas for this swindle, or Amazon for a vague description, but I guess I only have myself to blame for not taking the time to properly research the item before pre-ordering it.  I hate the changes made to these classic films. On my planet Han ALWAYS shoots first!
034552554X|5.0|This book is very well written and a beautiful but sad story of a girl trying to move on from her troubled past.  The main character, Victoria is just being released from foster care when the book begins and continues on as she begins to \\"become an adult\\". She is so innocentand loveable, but also infuriating. You care deeply about what happens to her even when you want to shake some sense into her! When she was young, she was taught the 'language of flowers' (used in the Victorian age) and she uses her love of flowers to help her make her way in the world. I loved this book, and would reccommend it to anyone.
B0058ZPNOK|3.0|The story centers around TJ after his mother has died as he and his dad attempt to get their life back to normal. TJ is a bad luck kid who is not only depressed, but bullied. Hesher, an anarchist, bullies his way into TJ's life and shows up at improbable times, almost as an imaginary alter ego. The writer attempts to shock the audience with the audacity of Hesher's acts as well as his crudeness, which I thought didn't work as well...especially the idiotic scene where he is talking about granny rapers, or his \\"perverted metaphor.\\" The inability of the author to create audacity without constant crudeness shows a weakness.<br /><br />The actors did an excellent job. There were many scenes you sit and ask yourself, in a good way, \\"What just happened here?\\" Or \\"What the heck is he doing now?\\" Life as usual falls to its least common denominator as the grief stricken family starts to imitate the anarchist ways, which seem to lack consequences in this film. Parts of the film were excellently done, while other scenes were weak. I suppose the ending of the film was supposed to make us feel good about the whole thing, but it doesn't compensate enough. Personally I think that if they toned down the crudeness of Hesher and put in Zack Garifalakis in that role the movie could have been a box office smash.<br /><br />Normally I love these indie style quirky comedies, perhaps I have seen too many of them to enjoy this one to its fullest. And what the heck was Natalie Portman doing in this film?<br /><br />Excessive F-bomb use, crudeness.
0670022411|1.0|Some may find the implication of my title extremely appealing, but I barely made it through the first book and never finished the second because I did not identify with or envy Bella and found Meyers vampires simultaneously tedious and aggravating. Likewise I do not identify with, sympathize or envy Diana and find Harkness's vampires mostly aggravating. Diana may be more aggravating than the vampires though, she is a professional woman in her 30's, but her behavior, reasoning and actions are those of a 16 year old girl in high school dealing badly with her first real disappointment in life.<br /><br />I got this book (thankfully for free) on Audible several weeks ago expecting a much different story based on what I had read about it and have been listening to it while at work, but have not managed to finish it because 1. Its much longer than one would reasonably assume, 2. Boring, 3. Arrgravating and 4. At some points pretentious. I don't care about yoga, wine or horseback riding, but still had to listen to lengthy segments on all three interspersed with Dianas bad judgement, absurd actions and poor behavior. I find her to be, like Bella, inconsiderate, selfish and unconcerned with the implications of her actions on not only those she supposedly loves, but those close to them and her and cannot identify what may motivate her other than an obstinate nature.<br /><br />At this point I am about halfway through the book and aware that nothing can redeem it, but set on finishing it because I always finish books that I start.<br /><br />There are no redeeming qualities to this book that I can tell and I realize that my opinion is not the popular one, but feel compelled to warn others like me who are more grounded in reality and enjoy books about the supernatural that take a more realistic approach.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|No doubt many of you have heard the argument for \\"video games as art\\" and hear the words \\"ICO\\" and \\"Shadow of the Colossus\\" thrown around. I never had the chance to play these two games back during the PS2 days, so after reading and hearing so much about them, I was excited to see for myself what all the hype was about.  ***Disclaimer*** I won't go into much depth about the technical aspects of this game because frankly I consider this game to be true interactive art.  ICO:  The basic plot (no spoilers): People born with horns don't fare well with the local villagers, so young Ico is sentenced to a life of solitude in a seaside castle. Through a series of events, Ico comes upon another person in the castle by the name of Yorda, a young maiden who has much to offer our hero Ico.  Many video games in this day and age have an obligation to offer a game with high replayability, whether it is a vast RPG like Elder Scrolls or a multiplayer extravaganza like Battlefield. ICO set out to break the mold and offer one of the simplest video game experiences around. However, this minimalist approach is precisely what makes ICO a masterpiece. This game is far from perfect in terms of mechanics; the battle system is as complex as a three-hit combo, the timing and placing of jumps can be off at times, and the AI can induce facepalm moments. None of those small gripes take away from the experience of ICO because at its heart, ICO is an emotional journey.  As a derivation of surrealist painter Giorgio de Chirico, the art style of this game is astonishingly beautiful. Firstly, the camera angles are distinctly cinematic, pulling back at key moments and zooming in at others to offer a movie-like feel to the scenes. The overexposure to all the living parts of the castle emphasize life itself; Yorda's radiant, angelic figure, the bright, lush greens of the grass and the trees, and even the small little birds that flitter across the stage offer respite from the ominous magnitude and shadows of the castle walls and inner sanctums. The animations practically seal the deal of visual mastery. Ico and Yorda's movements are all so believable and the simple motion of grabbing Yorda's hand becomes so heartfelt as the game progresses. Seeing Yorda stumble along after Ico makes the player aware of their own haste, but like any child, curiosity to explore the world can overcome judgment.  The audio design took a daring approach by offering as little as possible. The sound of Ico and Yorda's footsteps, the howling wind and crashing waves,  the mechanical whirring of cranes, and the melody of birds chirping make up the majority of the game's soundtrack. Certain songs play during battle scenes, cutscenes, and the save menu, but other than that the non-existent soundtrack makes this experience undoubtedly personal. There is no music to distract the player and cutscenes offer very little dialogue, often times posing more questions than answers. There is only the sound of the environment directly around you. It's a testament that the very world itself can be a soundtrack for the player, that often times we just need to take a breather and really absorb the world around us.  ICO moved me in a way that no other video game has, or possibly ever will.  SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS:  The basic plot (no spoilers): How far would a man be willing to go to resurrect the love of his life from her eternal slumber? The enigmatic Wander steps up to this challenge, but may very well have bargained for more than he expected....   Boss battles tend to have the most impressionable and memorable moments in video games. Team Ico set out to create a game that was solely a 16-Boss-Battle-Run and birthed Shadow of the Colossus. With the same minimalistic approach from ICO, the team created a game that amplified those elements ten-fold; keep it simple in design, but complex in its structure and emotional depth.  If anything, the Colossi are the embodiment of Team Ico's philosophy. The creaturesare enormous, ominous, and powerful. At the same time, they are beautiful, majestic, and vulnerable. Often times, in order to defeat a Colossus, you must use its strength or animal-like behavior against it and it is gut-wrenching to watch the grand creatures fall to their death. The camera usually grants the player a view of the Colossus's face as you deal the fatal blow and it builds a personal feeling for the beasts that is unprecedented in any video game battle.  Agro, our hero's beast of burden companion, is officially tied with Link's Epona as the most reliable horse companion that I've ever had the privilege of leading on a grand adventure. The Colossi battles that permitted Agro to join you are nothing short of spectular because Agro is not only a beautiful horse but a strong and capable one, allowing you to ride on her while standing and shooting arrows at the beasts and getting right back up when knocked over by a Colossus.  The only other game I can think of that matches Shadow's scale when it comes to enemy size is God of War III, and that pushed the PS3's hardware as it was. There are definitely some surprises along the way which I won't spoil, but every Colossus is so unique and offers its own unforgettable challenge.  BONUS MATERIAL:  Included with this bundle is a compilation of five behind-the-scenes videos including concept and making of videos of Team Ico's various works, with a special look at The Last Guardian, the team's next project. The videos offer a taste of the philosophy and design process behind the development, and there is PLENTY of praise for Ueda-san's mastery. You can decorate your XMB with two excellent dynamic themes, one from ICO and another from Shadow.  FINAL THOUGHTS:  The ICO & Shadow of the Colossus Collection is not for everyone -- the games are deliberately slow at times and the controls may seem clunky at various moments. There is no overarching soundtrack to groove to and no customization options for armor or weapons. Instead, these experiences rely on artistic vision, to provide an atmosphere that is unmatched in this industry. Surprising bonuses await dedicated players who journey on a second playthrough, offering good incentive to revisit these unparalleled worlds. Every self-respecting gamer (casual or core) should witness this video game compilation for themselves.
0525948023|1.0|What a load of bologna. This book is hard to follow, tedious, boring, and just plain mumbo jumbo. Tolle is full of himself and full of \\"it\\".
0312588887|5.0|I am delighted with this purchase.  I read this book like ten years ago, and loved it.  It is one of my favorites. I wanted to read it over again, and I now have it brand new thanks to you and for less than $10. I am enjoying my book again.  Thanks again.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I bought this collection when it was on sale, and I couldn't have passed it up. It contains all the seasons and both the movies. It came in perfect condition, but I bought it as a birthday gift to myself so I have to wait to watch it.
B0032KNA4I|1.0|I'll keep this short. I love movies, including disaster ones, but this one has to be the absolute most ridiculous waste of talent ever assembled. It's not even worth discussing all the examples of stupidity in this movie, but if you are looking for a lot of laughs (what a sad comment to make since practically the entire human population dies here), this is the place to go because almost everyone in the theater kept on saying \\"are they serious?\\" as the 'heroes' kept escaping everything mother nature threw at them. Throw in every stereotype under the sun and you have another Hollywood extravaganza thought up by some people high on drugs. Save your money.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|Got the movie I wanted in no time at all. Came exactly how it was described and in perfect condition.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I just could not put this down! After the week I have had I really needed/wanted a lighthearted read and this was the perfect fit! I was smiling and or laughing almost the whole way through this book and carrying it through the house with me while I was cooking and doing laundry!<br />Emma was very likable and I loved how the story was written because it was believable! It didn't make it seem like everything will always work out perfect like in some books in fact NOTHING Emma did seemed to go her way! She was not flaky or annoying like I find a lot of characters to be she was funny and down to earth and just like a lot of other single women just trying to get by in there life! Oh and it reminded me that I am not the only one with a family I wish I could trade in!<br />I loved this book!
B000PMG16U|4.0|I pre-ordered both box sets for my husband as a birthday gift and he loved them! The packaging is not fancy like most box sets, it's just a simple thin cardboard box, but all of the movies are there so he's happy!

B000PMLFRA|4.0|The box set I am writing about is Star Wars: The Original Trilogy on blu-ray with the blue cardboard box with the main picture of Darth Vader. There are many changes in this box set from the original, but my husband is not such a die-hard enthusiast as to be terribly offended by them (except the music scene in Jabba's lair.. didn't really fit). Also, when Han Solo is bargaining with Jabba the first time and tells Jabba he's \\"a good human being,\\" in the original Jabba really was a person, but in this version they've put the new sluggy Jabba character over the original one who used to be there.  The cardboard cover on this box set is not as fancy as a lot of the other box sets, it's a simple, thin cover that, while not too impressive looking, still has all the discs in it that read in our player with no trouble. I pre-ordered these and they arrived almost instantly once released.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV made the band justifiably immortal with music that still demands your attention and never lets go until the very last note of the album. Robert Plant's vocals are some of the very best and most passionate you'll hear in your lifetime; and Jimmy Page played guitar as if there were no tomorrow. John Bonham on drums is excellent! John Paul Jones also deserves much credit for handling both bass guitar and keyboards as if his life depended on it--it's all so good I could never tire of listening to this album. I have this on vinyl even though I played it so much I've worn out all the grooves, and now I have it on CD. Led Zeppelin IV will always be a staple in my music collection. In addition, the sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />\\"Black Dog\\" opens up with some great music and lyrics that prove Led Zeppelin was turning out a massive album from the word go; and the guitars sound great as Robert Plant sings every word without a hitch. \\"Rock and Roll\\" is also very well done; and \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" is a solid number that amazes me. Of course, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is a work of genius; I rarely if ever hear music as well written and performed as \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" (The lyrics are printed on the CD liner notes.) \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" uses both major and minor keys with some mighty guitar work and Robert Plant's singing to make this a standout rocking number; and \\"Four Sticks\\" has a fine rock and roll feel that is obviously still more classic material. \\"Going to California\\" has beautiful guitar work; Robert Plant sings this somewhat folk sounding number with true blue heart and soul. The album closes with \\"When the Levee Breaks;\\" we get an outstanding, rocking yet bluesy number by Led Zeppelin that shows their versatility once more.<br /><br />Anyone who wants the best of rock and roll owes it to themselves to get this album. Led Zeppelin IV has nothing but the best of pure rock music with a folksy, bluesy side dish that makes this both irresistible and indispensable. There are and will be very few albums that even begin to approach this level of quality; and that's exceptional.re are and will be very few albums that even begin to approach this level of quality; and that's exceptional.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|I presume that anyone who has already bought this album probably likes both Anthrax and good music.  So with that being said, if anyone is already coming back to say that this album is anything less than what they expected they are absolutely crazy.  I don't think anyone with realistic expectations would expect this album to be anthing more than a few good tunes and some other servicable ones.  This album was a huge surprise.  It is beggining to end a great production.  There are absolutely no fillers or weak song.  I was already sold with the first few songs, but once you get into I'm Alive and The End, the album just takes it to another level.  It's also glad to see that they still aren't concerned about selling out, seeing that the majority of the songs are not radio friendly due to length and/or content.  As you can see I use the word album, that's because I have been around long enough to appreciate good music, and don't get caught up in \\"high school\\" discussions on which singer I like better.  Really? The singer?  By the way Joey does a great job with this return album, but people try to start listening to the music...)

B005G4TJI4|2.0|About the only thing that I agree with what I've heard about this movie is that it's the best Transformers movie of the trilogy. In my opinion it just sucked a little less than the first and a lot less than the second. The film follows Bay's classic formula for all his movies. People walking in slow motion, check. Incredibly sexy women running in spiked heels, check. Using black men for comic relief, check. Steady streams of explosions and incredible stunts, check. Shots of the military that could easily be put into any promotional material for the armed forces, check. Painfully cheesy dialog and sad attempts at humor. \\"Dramatic\\" scenes that are only dramatic because of the orchestral score of sad violins, check. Bottom line is that the movie is two hours too long. It's boring, really boring, with uninteresting characters, bad writing, and a paper thin plot. Just fast forward till you see an explosion or robots fighting and watch those parts. Should only take you half an hour. Better yet, don't buy or rent this movie so they will give the Transformers license that can actually direct.
B0055PMJMW|2.0|I was expecting a lot from this book since I am an avid fan of Connelly, however I was feeling a little bit cheated because the book sounded like it was from a new author and not from the famous Michael Connelly.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Picking up at the conclusion to the first season of Spartacus: Blood and Sand, the six-episode series presents the ascension of the House of Batiatus as the passing Quintus Batiatus' life before his dying eyes.  The series shows the societally impotent Quintus' growth from a groveling schemer to the head of the powerful Batiatus lutus of the series' first season. We get to see Quintus' acquisition of Crixus, as well as that eventual House Champion's rise from lowly slave to powerful gladiator. The character is nearly unrecognizable from the clean-cut image portrayed in the first season, with that shift in appearance part of the character's own development. The initiation of his affair with Lucretia is also shown, with her need to produce a son for Quintus overriding her relatively puritanical view of extramarital activities.  The clear star of the miniseries is Dustin Clare as the charismatic House Champion Gannicus. A hard-drinking, oversexed, lazy gladiator, he becomes the focus of the conflict between Quintus and one of the city of Capua's power brokers. Unwilling to lose his greatest galdiator, and thus the only clear means to achieve some semblance of status above his lanista status, Quintus endures beating, humilation, and other abasement repeatedly due to his refusal to sell Gannicus to his social superior. From his reluctance initially to his increasing boldness as backing down clearly is anathema to him, as is humility and humbleness, he suffers for his ambition.   The gem of the series if Jaime Murray as Lucretia's corrupting friend. From her loose morals to her gold-digging pursuit of a husband, she transforms the House of Batiatus from just a lutus to the carnal house of the series' first season. While she couches her moves and machinations as directed to aid the rise of the House of Batiatus, it's clear that she is really just attempting to meet her own drug-addled desires. And we viewers are the beneficiaries of her lack of moral compunction, from thebloody single combat in the lutus as a demonstration of gladatorial quality to the orgies that are the end result of her sexual liberalism.  The digital images on the DVD rival the quality of my Blu-Ray of the first season, and at lower cost. The special features are respeactable for the most part, with nice behind-the-scenes shorts on such things are choreographing the arena fight scenes, for which the actors had to train relentlessly. The lowest part of the features is the one thing I look forward to the most: the bloopers. While there is a blooper reel, it is just about the most dull set of outtakes I have ever suffered through. It is the first I have never laughed at at all. It's really not funny and the set would just as well have left it out.

B005F3XV62|4.0|Kevin James is a simple and hardworking zookeeper who loves his work, his efforts at going after his mate has been unsuccessful since he is just a zoo keeper, in order to impress his mate - he goes after a profession which he does not like i.e selling luxury cars at his brother's dealership.  He does this with help from his zoo friends i.e the animals who teach him tricks on how to dominate (ex: pissing off to mark his boundaries, which is practically follows by relieving himself in a ornamental pot, to which the host gently remarks that there are designated restrooms !)  He accomplishes what he wanted i.e to get his mate, but leaves his life completely unfulfilled, then finds his true love ...  This is definitely not one of the best comedy movies for 2011, but a decent sitcom movie which will make you have some good belly laughs once in a way.  Overall, it is worth watching, a decent story line and some nice acting.
1594744769|5.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but when I finally did I wasn't disappointed.  It is a beautifully written story by a very talented story teller/writer.  Every description allows the reader to feel what the character is feeling as well as see what the character is seeing.  This book was not morbid or scary.  There were some passages near the middle and end that were graphic in description, but not to the point of horror.  The story was funny in parts and sad.  It was also a terrific depiction of how a person can change through certain circumstances.  I found the book a delight to read and quite enjoyable with a few twists.  I recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in a story that isn't ordinary.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|You are either going to LOVE this movie or just HATE it - nothing in between.  The movie is about Eric Zoolander who is a male model and supposedly like all male models - he is just a tool, an accessory who is programmed by Agencies to obey commands of an evil master and eventually plotted to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia in a fashion show.  Hmm, that does not sound like a nice story like - but with a actor pair like Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller - this is one awesome movie.  This is a good movie for one of those sunday afternoons where you want to kick your shoes, relax and watch something that uses less than 0.01 % of your brainpower and get a good laugh out of it.
0786838655|5.0|I like to read books before handing them off to my teenage son and, boy, did I have fun with this one. If you have finished Harry Potter and are desperately waiting for the sixth and final book in the Alchemyst Series by Michael Scott, this series will keep you busy.  The book follows the classic \\"ordinary child discovers that he is special and ends up on a quest\\" format. Here, Percy Jackson discovers that he is a demigod/half-blood god, and, thus, has special powers - as befitting the son of a \\"big three\\" god. He is sent on a quest to save the world. He succeeds (surprise!) - and cue a whole series of sequels.  The book is entertaining, funny, and has a satisfying plot. The language is quite simple and advanced 5th graders should be able to handle it. Perfect for middle schoolers and 9th graders. High schoolers will find it an easy read, but should enjoy it. (Hey, there is nothing wrong with reading just because it is fun!)  There are a few irritating environment digs (Tut! Them humans are such poluters, etc.), but they do not distract from the book too much.  Recommended.
B0018QPPXW|5.0|This is one of those movies which you see once and remember for a long long time.  You will remember for the scenes, music, the one liners.  Tom Cruise is a smart kid who is trying to get into Ivy Schools at the same time has a fantasies which he wants to fulfill when his parents are gone away.  Fueled by ideas and suggestions from his nerdy friend - he finally takes the guts to call an escort home for some good times - the events that turn out takes interesting twists and turns.  The movie has some steamy scenes, brilliant music  ..  Tom Cruise is at his best - a 18 yr old, shy, smart kid   Overall - the movie is worth 98 minutes of your life   (Thanks to Amazon Prime !  I am watching movies which I would have never watched otherwise )

0312323867|5.0|Which is, thankfully, actually an inspiring thought because it means there's hope for all of us!  I have to confess that I never read Something Borrowed, instead only watching the movie.  I loved the movie and was intrigued at the prospect of having Darcy now get her love story.  I bought Something Blue this afternoon at the bookstore, and I got through the first hundred pages or so.  The beginning was all about the spoiled, bratty Darcy, whose thought processes sometimes mirrored my own on occasion (guilty!).  It was interesting to read about the events/plot of Something Borrowed from Darcy's perspective.  I thought that was very clever.<br /><br />Anywho, I picked up the book again before bed, figuring that I'd read a few more pages and hit the hay.  Yeah, that didn't happen.  I couldn't put the book down!  This was such a beautiful story - not just because it was a touching narrative on true, soul-deep love, but that it was also about the radical transformation of the shallow, self-absorbed Darcy into a woman worth her salt.  It was a great read on how we can transform ourselves and find amazing experiences/love/lessons if we open ourselves up to learning it.  Definitely now a favorite on my bookshelf!
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The actual attachment that hooks the iphone into the tripod is a good product aside from one flaw. The top hook that secures the phone into place is spring loaded. Mine came with tons of tension on the spring where the hook part would pop off before the length of the hook was even long enough to grasp the phone. I had to take superglue and securely attach the top hook to the spring loaded mechanism before it worked correctly. For this I took off one star because I had to modify the device right out of the box before it would even work. Another star was taken off for the cheap tripod that came with the attachment. It's fairly low quality and seems to me that it was just thrown in to be able to justify an increase in price. After purchasing this product I found just the attachment on other websites for $3-4. I would recommend just buying that and using your own tripod or getting a better quality one rather than spending $7 on this piece of junk.

B0053Q9DQI|1.0|This disjointed version of Jane Eyre is simply not worth the money.  There was so little development of the relationship, having it leap from introduction to passion without any scenes to speak of to allow for this progression.    The relationship between Eyre and her cousins is not developed at all, simply going randomly into \\"choosing\\" to be family without anything said of being cousins-- in fact, it is a fiction of sister and brother that is given without a foundation in relatedness as in the book-- this is a rather random and objectionable alteration.  There are multiple movie versions of this book and several of them are far better!!  I expect better from a BBC movie.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Fantastic game, as usual. It's every bit as fun to play as it was on the computer and on the Nintendo DS... But that's all you get. There are no mini-games to speak of. The &quot;mini-games&quot; in this version of PvZ were just replays of levels from the regular game. No Zen Garden, no endless vase breaking, no survival, nothing... Just level replays. This basically ends all purpose for replay and makes it ungodly difficult to make the money to buy stuff from Dave. I recommend you but the Nintendo DS version for the best experience.
B000784WMW|5.0|I was skeptical that a modern rendition of this story could do it justice; so often, the more modern adaptations use a story from another era to promote modern issues and thus do violence to the story itself and to my delight, this version avoids that sin. No adaptation is perfect but this one does a better job than most.  At times, the story drags slightly, but what pleased me into five stars is how thoroughly this story is transferred from the book to the movie adaptation.  Clearly, choosing to make this a mini-series was the correct choice as this gives the opportunity to be so thorough.  I loved the development of the relationship between Rochester and Jane, the book leaves murky the efforts of Rochester to bring Jane from her limited view of her position in society to the mature declaration of their equality and this adaptation seemed to me to show this more clearly.  Timothy Dalton played Rochester brilliantly.  He managed to convey the layers of the character in a way that other performances of this role lack.  His performance conveyed the affection Rochester felt toward Jane even though his many machinations, in particular, the warmth of his gaze in many scenes. The scene after the gypsy fortune-teller incident where Rochester responds to the news that Mason has arrived showed how his heart had come to rely on her support and was, in my opinion, particularly sensitively played.    As for the many other actor performances I was not unhappy with the performance of any of the other roles. I thought that Mrs. Reed was played with a bit more contrition on the part of that character than is in the book but it did not jar.  The story did ignore the Reed sisters' fates which was disappointing.  St.John Rivers was handled well, with his steel will in resisting romance and disciplining himself in a strongly Calvinist manner giving a proper chill to how fond the viewer might have felt of him.  I especially liked the way the housekeeper's part was managed with the firmness of guarding the door, protectiveness of her family and the warmth of the housekeeper once the need to resist intrusions was gone; all were well handled.  The details of Jane's childhood were faithfully followed. John Reed played the role of the cruel bully quite nicely and his and Aunt Reed's attitudes toward Jane contrasted nicely with the role of the kindly sympathetic doctor.  After she went to school, the miniseries showed a bit more anti-Catholicism than did the book although not inappropriately for a Calvinist religious view of that era; the film developed the friendship between Helen and Jane without the confusing elements of Helen's reading preferences which was a good thing; however, there was a lack of focus on the epidemic that swept the school and took Helen's life.  It seems rather odd to add to the Calvinism with a teacher speaking a highly anti-Catholic line (however appropriate) and then to avoid fully portraying the depth of the greed in the management of the school and to skip over the later choice of the one Reed sister to join a convent in France.  If a religious prejudice is to be emphasized in one place then the balances to it, found in other places in the book, should not be avoided, nor should the sins of the Calvinist elements be lessened.    The efforts of Rochester to keep Jane after the truth came out were handled beautifully with the full scope of all the emotions portrayed quite well. The levels of degradation Jane experienced while alone and lost on the moors and wandering friendless and without money were thoroughly managed, even to the initial reception at the River's home, were transferred from the book to the film with far more detail intact than in most versions of this story.    I liked that the link of relatedness between Jane and the Rivers family was established properly as it made the distribution of the fortune make sense.  Her enthusiasm for finding family to love was faithful to the book and acted brilliantly.  The scenes with Jane and the injured Rochester were marred by the worst make-up job I have scene on film. My high school theater group had better make-up artists!  I don't understand why, after doing such a fabulous job with the rest of the mini-series, that this was permitted to stand.  I think the actors were handicapped by awareness that the scars were coming loose during filming and it limited the scope of emotion portrayed. With better make-up these scenes might have been as well acted as the earlier scenes between Jane and Rochester. In spite of the make-up fiasco, the ending scenes were satisfactory.  Of the many film adaptations of this book, this mini-series is my favorite.  I feel that it does the best and most thorough job of transferring the complete book to film without adding junk or leaving out essentials.  FIVE STARS!
0802473156|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone who recently went to marriage counseling.  I thought it would be useful as the book provides \\"tools\\" that one can actually use.  \\"Talk therapy\\" doesn't necessarily provide actual methods to improve one's relationship.   I took a chance bc i didn't know how this gift would be received.  However,  the recipient expressed appreciation and saw value in what she had read thus far.    I read the kindle format first and then purchased the book as a gift.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I loved the PC version, but wasn't sure how it would do on Android. I actually like the phone version better.   I'm playing on an Evo 3d and it's responsive and smooth.   I'm not sure if it's possible to play only one level. I have yet been able to stop at just one.
0765365278|5.0|Sanderson's ability to world-build continues to amaze me.  I've read all his original novels (so, all but the continuing works he's done for Jordan), and I have to say, each of his books/series are beautifully realized.  They have such depth to them that you can't help but be drawn in.  And he tells you of these worlds so deftly!  Some authors go on for so long describing things that it becomes tiresome, yet Sanderson somehow avoids that while still creating wonderfully lush settings.  And his characters are always so real, so interesting, and well fleshed-out.  The Way of Kings is no exception.  Though it may look rather daunting (being upwards of a thousand pages), it is phenomenal.  I don't think I ever became bored while I was reading it.  Although I will admit, I sometimes became impatient for the story to get back to my favored characters.  As the novel follows a couple different people, chapters might leave you hanging.  If you're like me, the whole book will leave you hanging, too!  There's so much going on, so many questions, and I just want to read the next installment RIGHT NOW!  I am definitely excited for the continuation, and hope that Sanderson will continue to deliver the fantastic storytelling he has so far.
0143038583|5.0|I have always thought I basically ate well. I watched what I ate and what I fed my family. Nutrition has always been my \\"hobby\\". I thought I knew. I thought what I'd heard about the ozone and  cattle farming was nonsense. Well, no longer. I LOVE Michael Pollan's books. I was one of the many who I feel were 'tricked\\" into thinking vegetarian fed, corn fed cattle was a good thing. He explains the process so well, that I will never eat (knowingly, I AM a guest in peoples homes sometimes) any beef other than 100% grass fed, IF I eat any at all. I am not a vegetarian, but I eat as one most of the time. Michael Pollen is superb at explaining, in a way that is neither too haughty, nor elementary, the food production, politics, economical, environmental state that we are in. It is a fabulous book, I refer to often and recommend constantly.
B004H3WWU2|4.0|Overall, its a tough sturdy little bag.  Used it for a bit but I do in fact sometimes need more space than this bag has to offer.  The image with all the zippers open showing stuff inside is a bit misleading.  Its open cause they cant zip it closed!!  Seriously though, if you have nothing but laptop, charger and a few extras, then its great.  I carry a bit more than that, plus if you end up with something extra during to the day to take home, it wont fit in here.
B001EN71DG|5.0|These are the first 3 STAR WARS ever made and they are the best. This trilogy also comes with the same movies, but with better sound and more color. When I was growing up, I never watched these things, but I can appreciate them now. Glad I've watched them,..now I have to watch the other 3.
1926778103|2.0|Firstly I have to say that Madureira's art is absolutely amazing. I loved the artstyle so much that returning this book to Amazon made it that much more heartbreaking. I still plan to get the hardcover of this, but until then I would not recommend that anyone buy it in it's current poorly designed state. By poor design, I mean that the pages instantly started to fall out upon opening for the first time. It was very disappointing.

B005KAH7QU|4.0|Hanna is a 2011 action film directed by Joe Wright, (Atonement, The Soloist), and stars Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett.  In a nutshell, it's the story of a teenage girl named Hanna who has been raised by her father in a Finland forest.  He has kept her completely severed from society and technology while raising her to be an assassin.  The film follows her submergence into our world once she goes to task.<br /><br />I read some of the negative reviews of this film before pulling the trigger and they actually pushed me towards the purchase.  Most of the bleating came from people advising me that the first thirty minutes housed the only scenes of real value and that the film went flaccid for the next hour.  That was exciting to me because I'm tired of watching car chases recycle themselves for hours on end while a soundtrack made up entirely of rapidly escalating explosions pounds like blistering techno until robots and/or trite superheroes show up and throw flaming meteorites at the scorched earth to attack/defend the human race.  I'm just tired of that stuff.<br /><br />But I still want action, and I got it.  In proper dosage, even.  The fight scenes choreographed for this film were presented at a heightened, but still reasonable human level and I appreciate that.  The director clearly wanted to keep the film on a more realistic track for its duration and there's some beauty in that.  The results were invigorating to me because I stayed connected which is a huge deal.  It was well done.<br /><br />That being said, the other elements in this film were also executed splendidly.  And yes, the movie does slow down, but not in a bad way.  A story develops, characters are introduced, and yes, I can live without gunfire for awhile while this all goes down.  I just don't see the problem.<br /><br />(Especially with the Chemical Brothers orchestrating the soundtrack?!  SCORE.)<br /><br />I think the only problem I had with the film was listening to Cate Blanchett with a southern accent.  Something just didn't feel right there.  Aside from that, however, the acting was stellar.<br /><br />In the end, I think I dug the movie because there's zero cheese.  None.<br /><br />And I need no cheese.<br /><br />- tt feel right there.  Aside from that, however, the acting was stellar.  In the end, I think I dug the movie because there's zero cheese.  None.    And I need no cheese.  - t
B005R32L66|1.0|After installed the latest version (2.5.0.108), it still kept crashing often and slowed my phone very significantly. The worst thing is there is no option to quit this app and you have to open Task manager to kill it. I guess, unless your phone is really on the supported phone list of the app, don't try it. It doesn't support HTC One S also. The color of the video is totally screwed.
1600597963|5.0|Dimensional Bead Embroidery is one of those books you absolutely should get if you have any interest in learning bead embroidery, or building on existing skills.<br /><br />The first chapter covers tools and supplies and explains about backing materials. Each of the projects are done on a foundation which is backed with another fabric after it's embroidered to cover the stitches.<br /><br />The second chapter gets into techniques, and starts from the very basics. It doesn't assume you know anything about bead embroidery which makes it a good book to learn from if you're a beginner. It talks about how to tie secure knots, finding and marking the center of the foundation you will be beading on.<br /><br />Then you learn how to plan a design working around a focal element like a cabochon and more detail on choosing the right backing material for your project, as well as tips for strengthening it if necessary. This chapter also has an overview of edging and finishing techniques.<br /><br />Using components give tips on how to use irregular components that don't have flat backs, have holes you want to cover and when you should glue a component down to the backing material.<br /><br />Then it gets into the stitches. If you overview the first few chapters and it's all things you're fairly confident about, this is where it gets exciting.<br />If you're a beginner to bead embroidery, this chapter covers how to do the 3 basic embroidery stitches, back stitch, couched stitch and lazy stitch, as well as variations like stacks stitch, loop stitch, picot stitch and other very textured stitches.<br /><br />Bezel stitches is where it starts getting very exciting for people who've done bead embroidery before. The author has a bunch of different bezels that are ornamental and functional.<br /><br />There is also a chapter on edge treatment and one on attaching pieces of bead embroidery to create something like a big, bold necklace.<br /><br />The projects range from things that could be done an in evening to very big projects that will take a few days. Because there is so much information in the first 8 chapters, you can easily modify any of these projects to suit your own component or style. My favorite projects are the Traditions in Lavender Brooch which could also be the basis for a beautiful barrette and the asymmetrical Midnight Waterfall Necklace.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with the clear photography, comprehensive diagrams and very clear text. The projects are gorgeous, and will garner many compliments.re is so much information in the first 8 chapters, you can easily modify any of these projects to suit your own component or style.

B005DZMODI|5.0|When two of the great musicians of our time get together, what's not to like? This CD has a group of talented musicians having fun doing what they do best. 'Layla', done as a funeral dirge, kind of threw me; it was just Clapton being his creative self. They took a wide assortment of deep, delta blues numbers, and blew them away. Traditionalists may find fault, but most Blues fans should enjoy it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is the most comprehensive collection of star wars movies to date. I don't understand why people give this a one star review. So what if he made ewoks blink, or if he added a few CGI rocks to a scene, big deal. Is that really going to ruin these great movies? These movies look fantastic and they sound even better! The roar of the engines passing by is enough to shake my room. The packaging is tasteful too. This is a great release and people should not be turned off by these bad reviews. They are just being nit-picky and whiney.
0143115014|5.0|5.0 out of 5 stars Thank You, October 3, 2011   By Roudnitska (Pacific Northwest) - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Perfumes: The Guide (Hardcover)   Luca Turin has been writing perfume reviews since he was a young boy forty years ago, smelling the great fragrances when they were still great. He's written reviews for various sources over the last twenty years, most of them in French. His articles for Folio Magazine are indispensable. It was actually many of the great perfumers themselves who wanted more of his reviews because they revealed a kind of insight that had never existed. If you want to know more about Luca Turin and the perfume industry you should read an excellent and fun to read book by Chandler Burr called The Emperor of Scent  A few quotes applied to Luca Turin: \\"A prelude to being able to explain the world metaphorically--the most immediate, compelling, and powerful form of comprehension--is the ability to grasp the world and its complexity metaphorically.\\" \\"He can nail any odor descriptively in a few words. He's generally not only exactly spot on, he gets incredible torque from the most recherché nouns.\\" He \\"not only does not use the cliched, uninteresting \\"categories\\" of perfume ingredients, he uses very few adjectives. Rather, he conveys the perfumes through imagery (where nouns do the work) and perceptive analogy. This is critical work that functions almost purely on the conceptual level.\\"  Aristotle said the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor. It is the one thing that cannot be learned from others; it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphor implies an eye for resemblance. Few writers in any genre have mastered metaphor like Luca Turin, and it's something that still blows my mind, regardless of whether or not I agree with every one of his perceptions of a perfume. The same goes for Tania Sanchez who is also perfume critic nonpareil.  Turin and Sanchez illuminate the reader with a subjective experience in fragrance,rather than herding cats in an attempt to id every note in a perfume house's fantasy pyramid (usually with extremely diminishing returns). What does it feel like? When it comes to wearing a fragrance, people are aiming for a subjective projection of their internal feeling each day, or a match to the weather, whatever. Turin and Sanchez concentrate on interesting deployments of key notes, or structural innovations, or landmarks of one kind or another, AND the subjective experience of wearing a fragrance.   I own most of the great perfume books, many of which are out of print or cost hundreds of dollars now, and I find Perfumes: The Guide to be the most informative, provocative, and entertaining perfume book ever written. And it isn't just the reviews, the introduction is by far the best general discussion of fragrances I've ever seen. Whether or not you agree with every review is irrelevant. A good critic is always going to teach you something, and closing yourself off to that kind of learning because you're upset about something they say is a sad loss. I mean if you haven't learned something from nearly every single page of this book then you haven't read it, or are for whatever reason not able to discern it.   Some critical acclaim for the soft cover edition called Perfumes: The A-Z Guide, which adds another 450 reviews and several more top ten lists:  \\"Their work is, quite simply, ravishly entertaining, and it passes the high test that their praise even more compelling than their criticism....Its blend of technical knowledge and evocative writing is exemplary in the strictest sense: people who write about smell and taste in any context shouls use it as an example.\\"  \\"Far more addictive than it has any right to be.\\"  \\"They make it so entertaining, you don't even have to like perfume to enjoy reading about it.\\"  \\"Nothing less than an essential possession. Most books that are called life-changing don't make the least little difference to anybody whatsoever. In its field, this one deserves the name.\\"  Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez,   Thank You for this outstanding book.
0553801473|2.0|First off I'll offer some background on my love of this series.  I read the first three books well after they were initially released and I read the fourth one just after its release and still in hardcover.  I pre-ordered A Dance as soon as it appeared on Amazon and after I received it in the mail, it took me about 2-months to push through it.<br /><br />Why do I mention this?<br /><br />Well if the economy was still booming the last time you read a book in this series then you may want to refresh your memory via a Wiki or some fan page.  Although I still remembered who the main characters were (Jon, Danny, Stannis, etc...), I had to pause and consciously recall who the Onion Lord was (still don't remember his name), the Greyjoy sailing across the sea (V-something) and a slew of other minor, or what I would consider minor, characters who appear here and there or have many chapters devoted to them.  This is completely my fault and I own it.<br /><br />Now to my second critique which will likely be as long winded and drawn out as the book itself was.  I'm an avid reader and when I sink my teeth into a piece of literature which I enjoy I can typically burn through it in record time.  For instance, I devoured the first three books in this series in a matter of weeks (all three), whereas the fourth book took me about 3-weeks and finally the most recent book took me a solid 2-months.  I even opted for poor American Airlines video entertainment during a Frankfurt to Philadelphia flight because the chapters I was reading were ripe full of detail and we're engrossing but completely lacked any significant plot advancement.  Let me say it again for emphasis. The chapters are ripe full of detail, which is entertaining and something I thoroughly enjoy from a book, but there was no significant plot advancement.  This is the main detractor of the book.  The whole book felt very much like Martin was reintroducing the reader to each of the characters.  This is a little understandable considering it has been, what, 7-years since the last book was released?  However, an entire book (also reference tome) focused on reminding the reader of so-and-so is...unacceptable.<br /><br />All things aside my main complaint is the little to no plot advancement found in the book.  Detailed descriptions of banners, marches, bowel movements, food, pyramids, guards, smells, entrails, gaits, flashbacks, ship movements, monkey and crow chatter, temperature variations, forced sex, vomit, whores, stoic statues, stoic expressions, rumored penis size, and all other manner of grotesqueries or beauty is fine and often times encouraged but not at the expense or replacement of plot advancement/development.<br /><br />Reference the review titled, \\"Feast for Crows, part 2 of 3 ! Ice & Fire, part 5 of 12?,\\" for what I feel is a fair description of the book and the series as a whole.  The review titled, \\"A few juicy moments drowned in gruel\\" is also good but it does contain *SPOILERS*.

1439170916|5.0|The book is just fantastic. Very well written, with a calm, warm and reassuring  tone (just as a good doctor should write). Very comprehensive. It feels as if a guide is taking you in a tour at the National History Museum. Step by step, it tells you the struggle that Humanity has had trying to find a cure to this remarkable \\"family of deseases\\" that Cancer is. It makes you feel humble and full of awe before the desease and it's power, and makes you respect a lot more what the \\"miracle of life\\" is. Sometimes I've even smiled (with agony) at the picture that until not long ago, doctors tried to cure Cancer behaving like the medieval \\"doctors\\", that is, trying blindly to cure a desease that nobody really knew it's mechanism and true causes with remedies that they really weren't sure of it's action.  In a nutshell. I am very, very happy that I've had the opportunity to read this book, and I recommend, from the bottom of my heart, to read it.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|If you're a fan of Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver, or even Iron & Wine, I highly recommend this album. I'm sure just about everyone knows them from the few songs off the album that became famous (not even sure which ones they were), and their live performances, but every song on the album is just as great as the next. Beautiful harmonies. Beautiful guitar and banjo work. Just beautiful.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I bought this for my Wife, she really has enjoyed the series, and to be honest, I have also enjoyed it.
B0021L8V1G|1.0|I bought this sight unseen because it had R Downy in it. Now I am afraid to look at the first one, also bought on the faith of R.D. That will teach me, the only thing worth wathching was Scarlet whipping butt and it was not even enough of that. A bit expensive for a few seconds of a really serious good fight sceen.  UGH---get it from the library if you must hurt your eyes.
1599218011|4.0|This is not a lose weight - get your big- butt-smaller kind of book.The word \\"diet\\" could be substituted with the word \\"health\\". This is a \\"get healthy book\\". The ideas are extreme - she promotes a lot of juice based meals, a vegan lifestyle and detox. Carr is not asking her reader to do it all. She is asking you to consider what this kind of health could do for your life. She IS fighting for her life, controlling her cancer through lifestyle choices and diet and she invites her reader to do the same.   I like this book a lot. It moves fast. It is gorgeous with the photgraphs and illustrations. I think her use of colorful language makes the book funny and light. Kris Carr is simply saying, \\"I have found the key to happiness and health for me. Here it is in my book. You should try it, or at least part of this way of life and eating. It works. It is good for you and good for the Earth.\\"  Am I going Vegan? No. I am considering many of the ideas she shared? Yes.  They are good and make sense.   IMO, worth the money and the time spent reading it.
0152023984|5.0|The unique quality of this book to my mind is that it makes readers of all ages thoughtful about life. While it can be enjoyed by a child as a straightforward story, for the adult the narrative is a parable on life, sometimes looking a little different as you grow older and more experienced.
B004LWZVZM|5.0|It is a shame this movie was not given the praise it deserves. Robert Redford did an excellent job, while the actors in this movie wer not household names they all gave a wonderful and believable performance.

(they still have heavypeak limiting on the loudest parts of the songs -- but the verses do drop in volume and are not clipped like those 2 discs, probably 'cause luckily this is a limited edition package with less mainstream appeal.)
B004ZNARH4|4.0|Clearly the music is amazing and the audio content that is included is nice, particularly the quad mix, but the visual material is seriously lacking.  The concert screen films are interesting but not essential, and the documentary really is, as another reviewer noted, a promotional spot.  If you have a high end system that can take advantage of the various audio mixes, especially the bluray, then this set is probably worth it.  Otherwise, just go for the experience version, which includes the Live at Wembley concert.

0439023513|1.0|Spoiler!  I can't believe this is how the trilogy ends. Like everyone else Mockingjay seemed half hearted, rushed, and hollow.   Firstly I don't know how the rest of you feel but I wanted Katniss to be w/Gale, who I feel was her TRUE love, not Peeta. But what does Katniss do she lets him go.... what a let down, and something the Katniss that I got to know would NOT of done (or Gale for that matter). Instead Katniss lives the rest of her life with Peeta (which is described as pretty miserable). Don't get me wrong I love Peeta, but I think he could of gotten another love, which he could of, coped better with, and been happy.  Also, Katniss who starts the revolution and helps win the war has no part in building the future?????? The one she lost so many people fighting for. Does not seem like something Katniss would of done.   I loved bits of the book though, when it seemed like it had the essence of the first two books had.  But the ending just destroys everything! I honestly balled my eyes out after I finished the book. I wished I never read the last three chapters. So I would never know what Collins had in store for our hero.   Collins you are one of my favorite authors now, even though you completely disappointed me in Mockingjay. I know you were trying to make it realistic, but Katniss would not of ended her life like that.   I wished there was a book four that starts with a different ending then the one in Mockingjay and was more in depth about the future of Panem.

1400052181|1.0|I knew something was amiss when the title character of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks died less than halfway through the book. \\"What's next?\\" I wondered.<br /><br />From Henrietta's death onward the narrative splits between the history of \\"HeLa\\" cells and the tedious struggles of the Lacks family. The author herself, writing in the first person, and Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, dominate the latter, violating the first principle of reporting: Don't become the story. In her research for the book, Skloot befriends Deborah and accompanies her on her pilgrimage to find the truth about her mother and her sister. Deborah calls Skloot \\"my reporter\\" (note the possessive) by way of introduction to everyone they meet.<br /><br />Skloot chronicles the Lacks family's victimhood with typical white liberal guilt that we expect of young Journalism graduates. She quotes them literally, grammar mistakes and all, as if there's earthy wisdom in their illiteracy. But the more she writes about them, the more I detest them. Too many members of the family use the so-called \\"robbery\\" of the HeLa cells as an excuse for their continued economic dislocation. They harbor a deep resentment for \\"scientists\\" that basically extends to all white people. They wax ad nauseum about ill-defined, uninformed fears of cloning, nuclear testing, and sending the cells into space. Deborah herself is mistrustful, paranoid, and obsessive-compulsive. In the same night she physically assaults the author, she returns to her hotel room every 20 minutes to update her on what's playing on TV.<br /><br />\\"Wait a minute,\\" you say. \\"I thought this book was about Henrietta Lacks.\\"<br /><br />You thought wrong. There's barely enough reporting on Henrietta Lacks to constitute half a book here. This book is really about Rebecca Skloot, liberal hero.<br /><br />There's a precedent for this. Five years ago Greg Mortensen became the hero of Three Cups of Tea, which he dictated to fawning reporter David Oliver Relin. Mortensen patronized poor villagers in Pakistan and Afghanistan and took veiled shots at the U.S. military and U.S. government for their illiberal lack of \\"understanding\\" in prosecuting the War on Terror. This earned him the adoration of the media establishment, specifically Parade Magazine and Jon Krakauer.<br /><br />Skloot does the same here, except, instead of poor Pakistanis and Afghanis, she patronizes a poor black family. Instead of the U.S. military and U.S. government, she takes shots at cold, unsympathetic doctors and scientists. And instead of Parade Magazine and Jon Krakauer, Skloot is adored by the New York Times and Oprah Winfrey, who is producing a film version of the book.

0440419514|5.0|These books are everything that fantasy should be. I read these when I was younger and enjoyed them then, but re-reading them now as an adult is a completely new experience. These are fun, exciting and entertaining books that any fantasy fan should enjoy. Many older children would enjoy these because of the adventure and ages of the main characters. But more importantly, these are books that can be enjoyed multiple times all throughout one's life. The themes are timeless and the writing is superb. Though thought of to be children's books by many, they are really wonderful for all ages and times. This is what makes them so good. Now a word on this particular product. The boxed set is well designed and visually appealing, it will look nice on anyone's bookshelf. The coverart is lovely and they are sized well for taking on trips. Also, these books really should be enjoyed as a trilogy. I promise once the last page of the first book is finished, the second installment will be the only thing on your mind.

160094048X|5.0|Baking has always been my outlet; it's what I do to relieve stress, to cure a sugar craving, or just to enjoy myself. I've been vegetarian for over a year (mostly vegan--I don't eat eggs and rarely eat anything dairy), and I felt like I'd lost one of my favorite activities. I was afraid that vegan baking wouldn't be the same, I wouldn't be as good at it, or it wouldn't taste as great. That changed when I discovered this book! I'm delighted to be baking and sharing delicious goodies with my friends again.   The recipes are easy to follow and will please new and experienced bakers alike. I appreciated the descriptions of what ingredients I could use to replace the old standbys (such as cane sugar), and everything I needed to get started was available at Whole Foods (where I shop anyway). I've already baked several recipes and I can't wait to bake more! I feel like I am discovering a whole new, exciting world of baking. I will definitely be purchasing the authors' other books.

0525423281|4.0|It's summer vacation, and Lola Nolan's life couldn't get much better. Not only is she rocking her usual: wig, eyelashes, bright colors, and glitter, but she also has a hot boyfriend, a great work schedule, and two caring dads. Lola can only wish that her Marie Antoinette dress for winter formal will come together and that her parents will accept her older boyfriend Max. She's certainly not thinking about the last boy she felt this way about nor wondering if he will move back in. But when the inevitable moving trucks arrive it looks like the string of renters next door has ended and the Bell twins are back. There's Calliope, the Olympic hopeful figure skater who is as cold and bossy as ever, and Cricket - taller, filled out, and as attractive as Lola remembers.  Suddenly Cricket and that last strained goodbye have become impossible to avoid, forcing Lola to do some serious soul searching. How she reconciles her complicated past with Cricket may just alter the future she's let herself imagine.  Ever since I read Stephanie Perkin's funny and charming debut Anna and the French Kiss last year Lola and the Boy Next Door was one of my highest anticipated reads of 2011. Many of you know firsthand that Anna was just the one - that perfectly captured does-he-like-me romance of YA contemp. I suppose with that high bar set it would be natural to have some reservations, but I felt oddly calm. I pre-ordered a copy and expected not to see it until release day or after. But then it showed up on my front step and after being faithful to the book I was currently reading (and finishing it) I intended to read only a few pages of Lola. How easy it was to read just one more chapter until in a reading intensive two days I turned the last delightful page.  From the memorable introduction of aspiring costume designer Lola to her pitch perfect voice, I was on board. What kept me coming back is the flawless wit in both the dialogue and the plot reveals. And especially anything in ALL CAPS.  The caps will kill you through either breathlessness or laughter. While I didn't always agree with the omission lies and the questionable choices Lola makes I definitely saw from where she was coming her perspective was written well. As she slowly begins to realize that her feelings for Cricket have never gone away she tries hard to do what she thinks is right. I loved the way Lola wedded fashion and costume in her daily wardrobe. It's every girls dream to never wear the same outfit twice. That her clothing reflected Lola's state of mind in a literal and one-of-a-kind way was super cool and represents well the many touches which made this novel so fun. The music scene of San Francisco, the Alexander Graham Bell connection and that Lola is named after the Dolores of Mission fame - it's charming in a quirky way. While a Victorian row house on one of the iconic hills of San Francisco is a little cliché a la Full House I liked how Lola and Cricket grew up looking into each others' windows because of it and the striking backdrop the historic and colorful houses make for the cover.  This brings me to my favorite part of the cover and the book: Cricket. I absolutely love when the little details of the cover are specific to the characters and events of the book, and I absolutely love Cricket. Maybe not his name (though it did grow on me) but that he was completely my type. He's tall, for one, with that effortlessly chic look and that somewhat geeky, silent-type-in-the-background thing going on. But back to the cover (The wrist bands! The pants! The star!) - did I mention that Cricket is TALL? Really, how was Lola the last one to know? Although it was obvious he was the one I wouldn't trade any of their charged moments guaranteed to leave you either sighing, giddy or goofily smiling for anything. With more than a cameo from Anna and Etienne and another developed and slow burn relationship, Lola and the Boy Next Door is an utterly fun, swoon-full, and riveting read that I couldn't wait to review and I can't wait to pass on.

142311339X|5.0|I was taken aback when I read the first book of this another masterpiece from Rick Riordan. You might ask why? It is because I was brought to a world completely different from that or Percy Jackson yet having the same substance that you would want for a fantasy novel. The humor is still intact, thank God! The characters amazing and frankly, I don't think anyone will ever dare hate this book. That's how confident I am.

He has another smaller back pack that he likes too, but he says this one is nice for when he wants all his lenses, etc. with him and to use for everyday storage. (For now it fits everything.  I don't know how long that will last though the way he's going... :P)  He was very happy and loves this.  And I'm happy that he's happy. :)
B003U9NAD2|5.0|Burzum certainly is a \\"love it or hate it\\" band, and this album seems to be no exception. I personally rank this album, along with Filosofem and Aske, in my favorite metal albums of all time. It's only made up of 4 songs, but each one is pretty long, and the total length of the album is pretty standard. Also, each song is unique in it's own way, so it offers a lot in one package. I'll break this album review down into 4 parts, one for each song.  The first track, Det Som En Gang Var, is a 15 minute trance track. It consists of a keyboard/guitar intro, leading into the main body of the song. Most of the song consists of a few riffs which are arranged in an order and repeated, but without it being centered around a specific riff (the chorus, in most songs). The only \\"pauses\\" are a sustaining guitar and Varg's signature vocals interrupting a few times. What sets this apart from the next two songs is that this feels more like a traditional song to me, since it has clear and defining changes, while the next two play through like one giant riff, even though they too have different parts.   Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is the second song, and my favorite track on the album. This is a very fast song with relatively little change through out it. The whole song has tremolo picking guitars and quick drums blasting in the back. What makes this song stand out to me is how the guitars are layered at times to create this epic sounding riff without adding very much. It's a little hard to explain but I know others love this song too.   Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen is the third song. It's my least favorite on the album but it's still a good song. It's similar to Hvis Lyset Tar Oss in a way, since it too is fast and has little change. However, this one just doesn't have the same impact on me that Hvis Lyset Tar Oss does. I think the riff isn't as catchy but that's just my opinion.   Finally, we have Tomhet. It stands out from the first three songs because it is entirely keyboards and drums. It'san ambient song, and it is divided into three parts. The first section, a bridge, and the finale. Although the song is 15 minutes long, it doesn't drag on like you would expect. All I really have to say is, it is hauntingly beautiful.  Well, that's all I have to say. Only buy this if you are experienced with black metal, because otherwise you'll hate it for sure.

B0033PQUXA|1.0|I am extremely dissapointed and very upset to find out today when I received my blu-ray copy of Cinema Paradiso that it is the cut version running 121 minutes and not the original Italian release  which runs 155 minutes. Amazon has this item advertised as running 155 minutes which is UNTRUE. I had to open the package and play the disc hoping for the option to play the longer version, only to realize there was no hope. Having already purchased this blu-ray title from Amazon.UK earlier this year, also suffering the same dissapointment, I feel betrayed and will ask Amazon.com to accept my return for a refund. The North American blu-ray release is almost BARE bones, with only the theatrical trailer as a special feature and a terrible, blurry standard definition trailer at that. Only the Italian MONO DTS track is available, with no choice for an English or Spanish track available in the original DVD release. What a waste of 50 G of Bluray disc. What a discredit to such a great film!!! Shame on you LIONSGATE, for releasing such an undeserving blu-ray. So when is the \\"Director's Cut\\" blu-ray coming?: I am sure only when enough sales have been made from this release. Wouldn't it have been much more noble to release both versions on this blu-ray, and let the film fan decide which version to watch?. I give this release ONE star, not the movie, which is still one of my all time favorites.
0679809015|5.0|The three by three is a perfect size for little hands!  My son loves this book.  He giggles every time we get to the dog and owl pages.  He loves lifting the flaps by himself, and caught on to the process quickly (bought it age 10 mos).<br /><br />The pictures are very simple and classic, this helps the infant focus on the flap.  I also love how well the flap is incorporated into each picture.  The animal really is \\"hiding\\" exactly where you'd find it on the farm.<br /><br />I grew up on a farm, but my son will most likely be a city kid . . . so I really really love reading this to him several times everyday.  We pull it out and he knows it is time to quiet down and take a nap.  It's the last \\"play\\" thing he gets to do before bedtime, and we both love the time spent together enjoying the book.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I never thought I would get bored of watching giant robots fight one another, but I did.  I had ready plenty of reviews that said this was the best Transformers movie ever or at least that it was better then the last one.  Frankly, I am not sure what is different in this one that than the last one (2nd).  I will state:  I never watched the cartoon; I really enjoyed the first movie.  The story had a pretty good setup, but by the end I didn't care and just wanted the movie to be over.  The video quality on the disc is top-notch and the 7.1 sound was terrific on my 120\\" scope/ 7.1 system.  I always like to see the subtitles in the picture (due to my constant in height setup).  I heard great directionality.  I saw no artifacts or any video problems.  Could easily be a demo disc for sound and audio.  As far as extras, this disc has none (probably why the video looks so good from a compression standpoint).  I can't seem to find time to watch all of the movies I want to, much less the extras.  I will be very wary before I spend more money on this franchise in the future.

0547258305|4.0|\\"Graceling\\" is a wonderful fantasy novel that I thoroughly enjoyed. Kristin Chashore created a novel with a strong classical story woven beautifully with a twist. Not only did Cashore have this amazingly clear idea for a novel but it was excellently executed.<br /><br />  The Graceling story begins with Katsa already deep inside a rescue mission. As the story reveals itself we learn that Katsa is one of the Graced, those born with supernatural powers. The Graced are recognized by the distinctly different colors of their two eyes. Though, the setting is never precisely clear, its safe to assume that the time is far, far in the past. I imagine a late Medieval or perhaps even an early Renaissance period.<br /><br /> The land is broken into seven kingdoms and Katsa is at the disposal of her King. Katsa is graced with killing and she is sent by the King to travel his kingdom and act as an enforcer to those brave enough to think they can defy him. But on one particular mission, Katsa begins to question the motives behind her Kings missions.<br /><br /> Slowly, we see Katsa break away from the hold her King has over her as she meets Po, a prince from another Kingdom who reacts differently to her than most. It is as she gets caught up with Po that her life begins to change and new adventures begin as she and Po set out to fight a corrupt king.<br /><br /> There is just a hint of risque romance, but Cashore handled it with upmost integrity. What bits she did revealed were classy and beautiful and I absolutely love it. I almost hope that Cashore would write an adult novel with more of these breathtaking love scenes in it. I'm not sure that I have ever read a love scene done as well as what Cashore did in \\"Graceling.\\"<br /><br /> My only complaint about this novel is that it took me a bit longer to get into it than most young adult novels. I had been warned about this by a friend, since I downloaded and read a sample first and determined the book wasn't for me. I was advised to push past chapter 3 and everything would move faster. Unfortunately, for me it was more like chapter eight. I kept picking up and putting this book down. But after that the book became to good to even put down.<br /><br /> I hope that \\"Graceling\\" will become one of those classic tales that we all come to know and love like the tales of King Arthur. Cashore writes in this poetic voice that is as beautiful to read as the story she has written. Nothing in this novel was rushed and everything developed and unfolded.ould move faster.

B0053B347M|2.0|Before I got this, I was using a desk lamp facing the wall as a light. The led strip easily replaces that light, consumes less power, and was easy to install. Unfortunately it does not turn off when the PC goes into sleep. I tried plugging it into the monitor's USB port. It did not turn off when that monitor went into standby.   So this basically works, but I don't like having to plug/unplug it every time I use the computer. Lamps and lights usually have switches (hint).

B005G4TJI4|2.0|I have been a Transformer fan since the 80s, so that part will stick with me. This movie felt like it may have been rushed and not thought through. Like the writer wasn't creative, like he was in the first two movies. Almost as if he lost his \\"Mojo\\" if you will...   I felt whatever problems Megan Fox and the Director had, should have been placed aside and she should have been in this movie. If at all else maybe Sam shouldn't of had a girlfriend at all. I thought the actress in this movie did ok, but should not have been added to replace Megan Fox.   I noticed how they didn't even mention \\"Makayla\\" in this film. I suppose then they wouldn't have to compensate her for anything.   Some of the scenes left you thinking is it done yet or really, this is so fake...  Please, I hope this will finish it up or if you would make another one bring back Megan Fox and have the other girl be a Decepticon with Sam and Makayla getting back together... That would fix all, Oh and bring back Iron Hide!  Gotta love the movies and what they make you think about, \\"Now how would I end that story\\"...  If nothing else, rent the movie before you buy it, then you will know what your getting!
0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is certainly creating some buzz lately. So, I was excited to receive a copy and see what all the talk was about.<br /><br />\\"The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.<br /><br />Le Cirque des R&eacute;ves<br />(The Circus of Dreams)<br />Opens at Nightfall<br />Closes at Dawn.\\"<br /><br />But what visitors don't know is that the circus is a venue for a game. A game between two enigmatic magicians (although they are much more than simple magicians) of indeterminate age and otherworldly skills.  Each has chosen a player and trained them for many years. And now that the circus is open, the game begins. The young players, Celia and Marco, are not even sure of the rules, how a winner will be dictated or what the playing should even consist of. And so we follow the circus, the game and the lives of everyone touched by the magic.<br /><br />Where Morgenstern absolutely excels is in imagination. She has conjured up fanciful, magical places and times. Her prose are rich and lush, painting very vivid images. I often found myself rereading these passages and imagining what one of the attractions would be like. For the attractions at the Cirque des R&eacute;ves are unlike any other. Each tent contains an unfathomable wonder that you may have only dreamed of.<br /><br />I loved the following imagery - books as both vehicle and voyage.<br /><br />\\"When she opens her eyes, they are standing on the quarterdeck of a ship in the middle of the ocean.  Only the ship is made of books, it's sails thousands of overlapping pages, and the sea it floats upon is dark black ink. They stand silently together as the ship drifts toward the endless horizon.\\"<br /><br />Where the book fell from a five to a four for me was in the pacing and character development. The first half of the book moved a little too slow for me. I did end up putting it down for a few days. When I picked it back up, the second half moved much faster, with more action and consequences happening.<br /><br />Although Celia and Marco are the main protagonists, there are many, many others integral to The Night Circus. Celia and Marco remained for me attractions - I never became truly invested in their love story or struggles, despite the fairy tale feeling of it all.  I found myself drawn to many of the other players, especially Bailey. His character is more tangible and I was able to believe him in him more. This could simply reflect the pragmatic nature of this reader.<br /><br />The Night Circus is a intriguing, inventive foray into a magical world that, deep down, every one of us wishes existed.

B00466HN86|5.0|I had the privilege of viewing \\"Courageous\\" this afternoon with my wife and two very gracious friends who had secured tickets for the initial showing in our city. I am a police officer, having logged on 23 years with the Carlsbad Police Department (NM), so I was looking forward to this movie with great anticipation.<br />Our friends asked me to comment on the authenticity of the daily law enforcement duties that would be depicted in this film. I can say the Kendrick brothers really did their homework; the daily operations were very well done and true to the life of the law enforcement officer.<br />\\"Honor begins at home\\" is the main message of this story focusing on the duties we fathers have in raising our children. God expects we fathers to be \\"leaders\\" in our homes. Seeing there is a serious problem in this country of fatherless homes, the writers address this issue very well.<br />The action is pure adrenaline; I was with these men every step of the way. There is also tragedy that will tear your heart. Yes, I shed some tears.<br />I commend the Kendrick brothers, all the fine actors and actresses, and the production crew for again creating a quality dynamic movie that will touch and convict hearts. I know that I was convicted about being apathetic in a few areas of my life. Everyone please view this movie, and may God bless you.

B005B1AT8G|4.0|This straightforward book is a good, quick, and easy read for any one in the health care field and/or anyone who is interested in quality improvement. I appreciate the interdisciplinary frame and the encouragement to look outside our respective fields for new ideas on how to improve. Whether you agree with Dr. Gawande's support of checklists or not, there is no argument about the need for increased quality in our health care delivery and that the stakes could not be higher. He certainly gets you thinking about how each person can be accountable for the change they want to see.

0307477479|5.0|To simply add a little to all that has already been written:  it seems that part of the intrinsic purpose of this book is to explore the scope and range of fiction - a goal that is accomplished with great virtuousity by the author. Yet, experimental as some parts may seem - particularly the PowerPoint part - the writing does not come across as greatly affected.  Each chapter works as a true story within itself, intrinsically, organically consistent, while at the same time maintaining an intricate connection with the other chapter/stories.  While it can take one's breath away from a literary-critical perspective, what ultimately makes \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" so compelling are the host of characters that the reader falls completely in love with.  Conventional or unconventional in structure and form or not, it's the storytellng that works, and the flesh and depth of the people who populate the stories that wins over the reader in the end.      It is indeed a \\"must read\\" for any lover of serious fiction.

B0020BUWX2|5.0|When I found the cover image for Gayle Forman's awesome debut If I Stay I remembered why it took me so long to read the book.<br /><br />I saw an ad for it in Entertainment Weekly that said, \\"Will appeal to fans of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight.\\" And I thought, Yik!<br /><br />I liked Twilight, but the last thing I wanted to read was another poorly executed, paranormal, Stephenie-Meyer-Twilight-ripoff.<br /><br />Let me say right now, If I Stay is not paranormal or poorly executed, and the only resemblance I see to Twilight (apart from being YA) is that both books are set in the Pacific Northwest--Twilight in Forks, Washington; If I Stay in Portland, Oregon.<br /><br />Different places and vastly different stories.<br /><br />I'm not kidding when I say this is the best book I've read since The Hunger Games trio, which would make it the best book I've read this year. Wait--then I read Where She Went, the sequel!<br /><br />These books are intense and powerful. If I Stay starts out with broody, cello player and classical music lover Mia and her quirky family--ex-punk rocker parents and precocious little brother Teddy--all heading out for a visit to friends on a snowy morning.<br /><br />Eleven pages later, her parents are dead and Mia's watching her body being transported to the ICU in a coma and on the brink of death.<br /><br />The family is in a horrible car wreck that kills both parents instantly, and the remaining 200 pages follow the next 24 hours as Mia remembers her family, her friends, her boyfriend Adam, her feelings of never really belonging, and ultimately decides whether she wants to stay and continue living or let go and be with her family in the next life.<br /><br />It's a moving, positive and ultimately hopeful story.
6304078102|1.0|I need to know how i can return this purchase, although I purchased it cheap, i am willing to let go of the hassle to ship it back.

B002JWD6AS|4.0|The book got a starred review from Publishers Weekly, and I agree that Stiefvater's writing is at times stunning. Absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />There are passages describing the wolves and the forest that are so poetic, you can almost smell the earthy mildew of fall and the chill of winter coming...<br /><br />It's really nice and very artistic.<br /><br />And for the first half of the book, the romance between Sam and Grace is tense and engrossing. (He saved her life! It's his last summer as a human!) But at about 60 percent in, the book literally stalled. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />The poorly explained responses to situations, and the set-ups that never played out were frustrating. And more than once I felt like Stiefvater didn't have a good grip on Grace's character. Her behavior was often contradictory--romantic and dreamy one minute, stoic and withdrawn the next.<br /><br />I pushed through it, and the story did pick up again. And I can say this: The book ends very well.<br /><br />So it's an artistic novel, but on the entertainment side, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Now I'm going to contradict all of that and give a True Confession. I can see teenage me LOVING this book.<br /><br />Contradictory behavior? Inexplicable conflicts with parents? Isn't that what being a teenager is all about? And swooney love with a sexy sexy scene (heads up, Moms). Oh, yeah. All my little friends and I would've been passing this one around.<br /><br />Teenage me would've given this book an A+ with stars all around it. And I'm sure she would've already rushed out and bought the sequel, Linger.<br /><br />So what's the message? I guess that it's all subjective.<br /><br />Personally, I love romance, but I also like my romantic characters to DO something. Of course I want to spend a little time on a character making the astonished realization that she loves someone and that the other someone feels the same way... (!) That's a big, life-changing discovery at any age.<br /><br />Please give them their moment, but then get them off the couch and get them moving. Keep the conflict and problem solving going. Do continue throwing in some smooches and quiet moments, but don't stall out there.<br /><br />I felt like Stiefvater became so enamored of her lovers being in love that she forgot what they were supposed to be doing. (Psst--It was figuring out how to stop Sam from changing back into a wolf forever!)<br /><br />So for this reader, I say 5 stars for beautiful writing, but 3 stars for storytelling.ng going.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay is a fictional story of a child who escapes the non-fictional round up of Jews living in Paris during World War II. I didn't know anything about what happened on the morning of July 17, 1942, so this was an educational read for me.<br /><br />But the learning was easy as it was couched in an engaging story of an American journalist writing (and learning) about the events while dealing with her own personal challenges--her husband's deteriorating affection and her discovery that she's pregnant at 45.<br /><br />The book is a super-fast page-turner with strong, emotional moments, and I highly recommend it. Julia Jarmond is a sympathetic main character who becomes obsessed with little Sarah when she discovers her husband's parents moved into Sarah's apartment-home after her Jewish family was deported (and later gassed).<br /><br />I give this one 4.5 stars, and I say definitely pick it up. It's about obsession, it's about choices, it's about growing older, it's about history and how events should be remembered... And I loved the ending. It was perfect.
B001W79MB8|5.0|This film is EXCELLENT.  The story, the animation, the score, all the highest of quality.  The only thing I can't comment on is the dub, I always watch subbed.  Highly recommended.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|I grew up in south Louisiana, and hubs accuses me all the time of being a French-lover. So it's possible my love of this book is rooted in that, but I doubt it. Perkins's debut is a delightful love story, and by page 20, I was hooked.<br /><br />When we meet Anna, she's being left at the School of America in Paris (SOAP) by her pretentious, nouveau riche writer-dad and her teacher-mom for a senior year abroad.<br /><br />She's crying and is befriended by her neighbor--a bushy, bushy blonde soccer player named Meredith. Then we meet Etienne St. Clair, Meredith's secret crush and ultimately Anna's. He's very attractive, with great hair and a British accent. All major pluses.<br /><br />Once St. Clair appears, the book tends to focus primarily on Anna's growing feelings for him, but that's okay because while it's happening, the reader gets this amazing trip through Paris as St. Clair shows Anna the city and helps her venture out of her shell.<br /><br />Perkins does a great job with this part, and I enjoyed \\"seeing\\" the sites with these guys and learning about historic landmarks. Great writing here.<br /><br />As the story progresses, it's clear Etienne likes Anna, too, but they face some challenges--he has a college girlfriend he's reluctant to break up with, Anna has a crush back home she still has feelings for, they both know the end of the year will be the end of their time together. It's an engaging set-up that works... for most of the book. And that brings me to my only small quibble.<br /><br />I felt like Perkins did a great job creating realistic teenage emotions--the intense awkwardness and insecurity (also the clumsy, embarrassing moments when sex comes up). The characters' feelings are palpable and very relatable. But after Christmas break and particularly after Anna's birthday night out, I grew weary of St. Clair's dithering.<br /><br />It's a pretty long book (384 pages), and perhaps some cuts would've helped. But! This isn't a major detraction, and the great chemistry between Anna and St. Clair keeps you wanting to know how it will end.<br /><br />The cover is totally deceptive, just fyi. To me, it looks like Gidget goes to Paris, and the characters are not that square. Anna's got a blue stripe in her hair and wants to be a film critic, and her best friend's a drummer in a punk band.<br /><br />Heads up to moms: there's an F-bomb, there are references to characters having sex and sexual parts (but in a totally immature teenager way), and there is alcohol use (and misuse). But I think all situations are handled realistically and appropriately, and consequences as well as responsible behavior are presented.w it will end.  The cover is totally deceptive, just fyi.

B00005AWMF|5.0|The CD arrived quick and it's just perfect. I was a little concerned at first because I purchased one before and it was scratched. This was just perfect and I am really enjoying it.
0525422943|5.0|The sequel to \\"If I Stay,\\" \\"Where She Went\\" picks up three years later and is told from the point of view Mia's boyfriend Adam, whose life has fallen apart after the car accident that nearly killed Mia and the choices she made upon recovery. Adam's music career has soared as he's poured all his heartbreak into his songwriting, and that's where the book begins.<br /><br />I didn't think I was going to enjoy the second book as much as the first for those two reasons, but I was so wrong. Adam's story is just as captivating as Mia's, and the ending is very satisfying...<br /><br />Forman's descriptions of Mia's parents were so authentic. Her tough, protective mom, her father evolving from punk to bow-tie wearing \\"responsible\\" dad. I even dug her theory on coma victims.<br /><br />And wow. The depiction of Mia as band girlfriend was unexpected. I spent Age 19-23 in almost that exact spot, and I never expected my feelings to be depicted ... well, anywhere. I felt like my response to that position was so nerdy and hard to explain. And then Forman went and nailed it. How predictable am I? (OK, except for the licking Adam's sweaty face part. I never had that urge... ew. *snort*)<br /><br />Good stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm afraid saying more will spoil the story, so I'll just say these books are amazing. I never laughed--too intense!--but I cried twice and was seriously moved. Super A+ to both, and hats off to Forman.<br /><br />Heads up to moms, there are several F-bombs in both books, Mia and Adam have a sexual relationship that is only alluded to (no graphic details here), and there is substance use and abuse. Poor Adam's pretty messed up in Book 2.<br /><br />So the books are adult at times, but still I highly recommend both for older teens and adults. They're fantastic and will stay with you for a while.
0062068423|4.0|I am torn between saying this was an excellent novel and one that left you wanting.  I had read The Snowman and liked it so much that I purchased The Redbreast.  I had trouble getting into the plot and characters for the first several chapters and thought I made a mistake in my purchase.  Then I started to see where it was coming together and got more interested.  I do think (for myself) that there were so many characters that it was hard to remember who was who and who did what in the scheme of things.  In the end, I did like the book but was left wanting.  I just don't understand why when Harry Hole thought so much of Ellen that he didn't let us come to a satisfying conclusion with her murderer.  Yes, the actual murderer was killed but the (in my mind) real murderer was not found out.  This just left me dissatisfied and wanting at the end of the book.  I do think he is a good writer and I will read more of his work, however.
B005DI97S0|2.0|A rather slow moving book that isn't what you would expect for the Vampire Chronicles.  This story about heaven and hell could have had any character in it and wasn't really a vampire story.  In addition, I found the ending anti climatic and unresolved.  The worst of the first five books, in my opinion.
B005PK5O5Q|4.0|My children have been fans of the rebooted Doctor Who since the first episode with the Chris Ecclestone Doctor. Russell T Davis did a great job of turbo-charging the original concept and bringing it up to date. Steven Moffat, the current script editor/wrangler/writer-in-chief contributed some great episodes for the first 4 series and was given the job of taking over from Davis when he moved on to other things. The transition episode, introducing the new (eleventh regeneration) Doctor was masterful in the extreme, brilliantly paced and faultless. But... Series 5 and Series have both been marked by Moffat's desire to create an over-arching storyline and - frankly - rather bombastic jeopardies for the Doctor.<br /><br />The end of the tenth Doctor came because he chose to rescue one single unimportant man. The eleventh Doctor, under Moffat's guidance, seems always to be rescuing the entire universe. And frankly it's getting to be a bit like over-kill, a trope that repeats and repeats like a nervous tick. Which is a shame, because quite often the dialog is very clever and very funny, and there are touching moments and lots of good acting, especially from some of the minor characters. If Moffat could relax a bit and have more confidence in smaller-scale story lines we in turn could have confidence that the next series will be riveting. As it is, one can't help but feel that the next step for the Doctor is to be faced with the end of the Multiverse - after all, once you've saved the entire universe a few times, what's left but the next step up on the Inter-Galactic Savior Job Scale?

156224003X|5.0|As everybody knows this book is great.  But I have been fortunate enough to have found another book, a sort of sequel, in a way an operational tool. It is The War of Art, by Steven Pressfield.  In particular you will find a different approach to the \\"That is the most beautiful sound I've ever heard.\\" An approach that I believe is more functional.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|While I understand all the gripes about the technical changes to the series, but come on.  They don't take away from the story, and THEY LOOK AND SOUND GREAT. There is nothing added that will make you say, \\"Man that made the movie really suck.\\"  I bet if you just watched the movies without someone telling you something had changed, most (I said most) people would never even notice the small changes.   If you want to see the original movies as they were released, by all means watch them on inferior media like VHS, or DVD.  Nobody is forcing you to buy or watch these.  If you want to see the Star Wars Saga at it's best, do yourself a favor, and buy the Blu-ray edition.  Don't listen to all the crazy negative hype.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|I ordered this set on a great Gold Box deal, $100 for the entire series.  I got it, started watching, and was immediately hooked.  It's a good thing I can plow though a disc a night, because I wouldn't have noticed that the occasional skipping would be prevalent throughout the series, due to SCRATCHING FROM THE DVD INSERT CASES!  Each season from the series comes in its own trifold thin cardboard 'folder', and the individual discs are inserted into disc slots in the folder.  The slots are made of the same plain basic flimsy cardstock of the folders, with no soft backing whatsoever.  I noticed this would be a real problem when I finally came to a brand new disc that refused to play.  I tried it in three different players, each to the same effect.  So, I returned it.  I would only buy this from Amazon.com, so you have the ability to send it back if you have a problem with any of the discs.  If you get a good copy, I would strongly consider housing the DVD's in a separate DVD case.  I love the packaging look, but having my discs play later is more important to me.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|looks like a good game but i found myself squinting to see the tiny sprites.  the gamee does not make good use of screen real estate which is an awful problem on a phone, making it practically unplayable for me. i think it could be improved a lot by adding pinch zoom functionality.

B0007OASII|5.0|This Album starts with three of my personal Favorite Kamelot Songs of all time, March of Mephisto, When the Lights are Out, and The Haunting (Feat. Simone Simmons of Epica).  This album has some of Roy's best singing (the Chorus of March of Mephisto is one of my favorite Kamelot Choruses) amazing song writing, and the duet with Roy and Simone in The Haunting is amazing. The album artwork is also awesome.  When i saw Kamelot live, i regret not buying the LP of this album for $15, But This album is a must have for fans of Power Metal, and is also a good starting place for people who haven't listened to power metal to start listening as well

0440246008|5.0|I discovered Lee Child several months ago and have been reading his books in the order they were published.  This book is very different from the others, so far, mostly in that it doesn't contain the types of violence found in most of the others (which violence doesn't bother me, but I know some people who think that even Mr. Child's careful descriptions of violence are too much for them), and consequently, this book is more like a true mystery than so much about action.  As always, I like Jack Reacher's relationships and attitudes about women.  Very forward thinking, which is a bizarre thing to be saying in 2011.  I would say so far it's my second favorite of his books.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I would give this set 4-1/2 stars, but bumped it up to an even 5 to counter the entitled whiners who don't even own the set and rated it one star instead of just voting with their wallets. Use a forum if you want to express your opinion, this is a review of the product in my hands.   While the visuals for Episodes II through VI look clean and sharp, the best improvement from the DVD version can be seen in Episode I. The sound in all 6 movies is also impressive; the first Republic ship in Phantom Menace rumbled my walls and turned my insides cold when it flew past camera. The movies really have Lucas-quality presentation. My only complaint centers around the lightsaber continuity that was disrupted with the DVD versions of the original trilogy. The contrast remastering that removed the white cores from the sabers has not been completely removed from these copies. It's improved in some scenes, most notably the Vader/Luke saber crossing in front of the Emperor in Return of the Jedi, but there are other scenes where they are unaltered from the DVD's. I would assume that it was a cost issue to touch so many more shots, but if there was ever a franchise that had the money to fix all those shots, it is this one.   I own several copies of these movies and expected the Blu-ray extras to match what had been released previously with the DVD's. I was pleasantly surprised to watch the first two extras discs and see completely new footage. That was a good 8-9 hours of behind the scenes coverage that I dove into rabidly. If you enjoy watching how these movies are made and the artistic visions that go into the final product then I HIGHLY recommend this set based on that. The third disc has a good selection of documentaries that I had not seen before as well as several spoofs that range from boring to ridiculously funny (<3 Robot Chicken).   Just today I discovered that in addition to the already released DVD commentary on each movie, there is a SECOND set of audio commentaries gathered from interviews with casts and crews. More value to a set that already ranks among my favorite collections that I own.   I would recommend this set to anyone that enjoyed the movies and would appreciate all the behind the scenes extras that have been crammed onto these discs. It would take a few dozen hours to watch and hear every piece of content in this set and I love that facet of it. Hope this helps people who are actually interested in the set.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Chickenfoot's self-titled debut, despite deserving a full five-star review, seemed, in spots, to be the sound of four great musicians still getting acquainted with one another, not always sounding greater than the sum of its parts. The same cannot be said of CHICKENFOOT III, on which the band sounds like a hard rock/metal version of the Allman Brothers Band or the Outlaws- incredibly raw and honest, yet melodic and featuring incredible degrees of light and shade, especially in Sammy Hagar's voice and in the musical arrangements. There's less of the party-hearty attitude and a darker, more reflective tone in both the music AND the lyrics, which is in a way reminiscent of some of Hagar's older solo albums, such as STREET MACHINE and THREE LOCK BOX. This could be due to the bandmembers' increased political awareness, as well as tough times in the United States and around the world. Even the one real party song on this CD, \\"Big Foot\\", has darker under- and overtones than anything on the first album. The fact that the members of Chickenfoot support efforts to free Americans jailed abroad, as well as Hagar's empathy for military personnel returning from the Middle East, the unemployed and the homeless, and his advocacy of the right of police to use deadly force to rescue kidnap victims from their abductors, make this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B005CM9DX6|1.0|Without a doubt the most boring and uninspired Opeth album i have ever heard.  I was unhappy with their last album but it was somewhat tolerable. This is just pathetic.

055358894X|5.0|I was in need of a good adventure story with tales of intrigue and action.  This book delivers in every way.  It satisfies the little devil in all of us, yet bleeds of the honorable actions of an atypical anti-hero.    The book moves fast, yet gives you pause for breath with frequent anecdotes (that form a completely relevant and interesting back story).  It's told much like a supreme campfire story, but with the depth of something much, much more.    Thoroughly recommended for anyone who loves action and doesn't mind intensity or some foul language.
B00430EQK8|1.0|Reading Amazon reviews should have warned me but, I was taken with the incredibly low price for a Blu-ray disc.  You usually get what you pay for.

I am hoping they can get a working app for all the devices someday because I like skype on my PC.<br /><br />Update: I was able to get video  to work in this app on my Toshiba Thrive tablet by checking \\"enable video chat\\" in the Skype settings  the 4th icon in the black strip below the blue  Skype window.  It was really hard to find!<br /><br />IMO even though it does work - Google talk is much simpler to use... and does the same thing.
B005LBJ2GQ|5.0|Opeth has hovered in the lower middle of my list of favorite bands for years. I have always enjoyed their untraditional (read progressive) take on black/death metal, but I have never been blown away by their music. Obviously, there was more of the black/death influence earlier in their career, but on more recent albums they have appeared to be going away from their earlier (harder) influences. With Ghost Reveries and even more on Watershed, Opeth began to expand on their idea of progressive music. Clean vocals began to play an even bigger role in songs that were less black/death influenced and more just plain old progressive metal. With Heritage, Opeth has taken the progression (no pun intended) one step further to create an album of what most will refer to as progressive rock. I don't like to get hung up on genres and sub-genres, but traditional Opeth fans are probably having a hard time with the fact that Heritage isn't metal in anyway. I personally love progressive rock and feel that Heritage is by far the best album Opeth has released to date. I am hoping that they will continue in this direction because their is no denying their creativity and artistic ability, and I can't even begin to imagine what they will accomplish next.

I love the characters, the music, the crazy plot!  Its such creative and different plot! Love video games or garage bands?  Then you will LOVE this movie!  I also just found out this movie was directed by Edgar Wright who also directed Shaun of the Dead and my favortie TV show ever, Spaced!  Now I must go and read the comics where this movie came from!!
B004LWZW42|4.0|This movie was exciting, riveting and very entertaining, in keeping with the rest of the X-men movies.  My wife and I enjoy the entire series.  Kevin Bacon is great in this, as always. And I enjoyed learning about the history of all the characters. I very highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed any of the other movies.
B004YEJGEO|3.0|loved the puzzle difficulty and concept. graphics were smart and functional enough. unfortunately, there were some complications with moving the prisms that didn't allow for consistent manipulation. eventually, that got too frustrating to overcome. other than that, neat game.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This book started out great however, it felt like the author gave up three quarters of the way and let someone else finish it.  There was no ending.  I was so disappointed.  I loved the characters, I love the history and the book etc..  What happened?!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|A nice game for when you're waiting for something else to happen. The unlocking of new blades and backgrounds is novel enough. Easy to learn mechanism, but difficult to master combo slices and bomb avoidance.
B004X4RU9I|1.0|First \\"IP Man\\" was awesome.  Period.  This film, \\"IP Man 2\\" is garbage.  Period.  Cheap, flimsy, paper-thin, amateur, weak, ridiculous, corny, laughable, boring, predictable, non-professional.  All words that describe this film.
B004YXE438|5.0|Neat selection of pictures, definitely varied levels of difficulty. Gameplay is straightforward, but interesting enough for at least some replay to get faster scores.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I am very impressed by Chickenfoots second album.  I loved how they stretched their own boundaries that were set up in their debut effort as well, which was IMO fantastic as well.  Have yet to take this off my MP3 player and am loving each song more and more with each play.  Could Satch's guitar have been a bit more out front in some of the songs?  Sure. I bet they could have.  But if you listen to Joe himself, he was as influential as anyone in the band as to how much guitar he wanted throuhout each song.  And yet, when he lets it rip, he is as always, amazing.  But yes, leaving you wanting more.  Sammy is still going as strong as ever at age 63.  It really is about time he gets the recognition he deserves for the impact he has made on the music scene for as long as he has and for staying at the top over that length of time as well.  Mikey really brings out the bass in this album, moreso than the original and his backing vocals are still the best around.  Chad does some great work on the drums as well.  I wish he was able to be with the Foot to promote and tour for the album though.  I hope his efforts don;t go over looked.  Kenny however, seems to being a bang up job filling in.  Love the record.  I'd say 8 of the 11 songs are 5 star songs and the remaining 3 are excellent 4 stars songs.  Just a great great job guys.  Keep em coming.  We need this music as no one else is or can fill the void.  Hawk

0670022411|2.0|I picked up the book based on the glowing reviews and the catchy storyline. The first third of the book caught my attention, but the rest of the book has been a nightmare to complete. The story has an interesting plot, but the dialogue and the details are way overdone. For instance, Diana starts off as a strong, smart, and mature woman with a sense of focus and strength and ends up a whiny, teenager-like character toward the end. The emotions were superficial, so much so that I was left rolling my eyes half the time. Now I realize that the entire story is building up to absolutely nothing in this book, that I would have to wait for a sequel to actually see any action. Based on the style of this installment, I will not be wasting my time on a sequel.
0062060554|2.0|Started out ok.  Got boring about the 4th time Christine woke up in bed with Ben and had to repeat the previous day's events. I started skipping whole paragraphs just to get to some progression in the story. Too may \\"I'm going to tell Ben about Dr. Nash and Claire\\" and then she doesn't because she senses something's wrong.    The ending ... seriously? Do we really think a man posing as her husband would be able to remove her from the facility?  That her best friend and son would not have done some checking when they found out she was back living with \\"Ben\\"?    Don't waste your money. It isn't tense and exciting. The writing isn't great and the ending is just too silly. Almost as if it were written for a low budget Hollywood movie ... that bombs.
B000002HD5|5.0|With 1993's `Gentlemen', the Afghan Whigs took a major creative leap from the previous year's `[[ASIN:B0000035F3 Congregation]]'. `It spelled the full realization of the band's savagely beautiful mix of alternative rock and soul. Fuelled by sophisticated musicianship, searing off-kilter vocals from Greg Dulli and potent lyrical themes of emotionally abusive relationships, self loathing and addiction, `Gentlemen' is at once dangerous, seedy and scarring while it is transcendent. On top of all that, it is absolutely intoxicating.<br /><br />It opens with `If I Were Going', a song that fittingly begins and ends with the sound of wind - because, without even hearing anything else, it feels like the unsettled calm before the storm - which it most assuredly is. The onslaught begins with the hopping drum intro and plummeting guitar riffs of the title, track (I stayed in too long/ But she was a perfect fit/ And we dragged it out so long this time/ Started to make each other sick). Both the tone and the scene are set. After the softer, self deprecating `Be Sweet', the clapping and bass-driven funk aggression and swirling guitar of `Debonair' returns the set to hard rock emotional ruin (Feel it now and don't resist/ This time the anger's better than the kiss).<br /><br />Throughout the album, this fevered psychological violence, sexual innuendo and festering low self esteem combine with Dulli's alternating screams and soulful smoulder to drive its 11 tracks into unexpectedly emotional and unnerving places. The whole thing plays as a concept album of emotional abuse, building with alternating ballads and screeching rockers.<br /><br />In `When We Two Parted', Dulli croons, `You say the victim doesn't want it to end/ Good! I get to dress up and play the assassin again' before he screams in `Fountain and Fairfax', `Angel, I'm sober, I got off that stuff just like you asked me to/ Angel come closer, so the stink of your lies sinks into my memory.' From here the threat builds with the wafting piano and driving guitar of `What Jail is Like' (I warned you, if cornered, I'll scratch my way out of this pen) before we hear the woman's side of the story in a suitably bruised vocal from Scrawl's Marcy Mays (Hurt me baby/ I flinch so when you do/ Your kisses scourge me) in the wrenching ballad, `My Curse'. Then the truly frightening crescendo happens as Dulli returns in the screaming attack rock of `Now You Know' (Did you have blinders on my dear or were you just willing?/ Or was I unaware of the damage a lie can do?... Bit into a rotten one now, didn't we?/ Baby, now it's through). And the story skids to an end with the softly sung excuses and self hatred of a startlingly faithful, though cleverley inverted and forboding cover of 70s Chicago soul singer, Tyrone Davis' `I Keep Coming Back' (Oh baby, I realize I treated you wrong/ But I'm so sorry, let me come back where I belong). The mere title of the final instrumental track, `Brother Woodrow/ Closing Prayer' implies, as epilogue, that nothing has ended well here.<br /><br />The conventional rock wisdom is that this is the `God' album of the Afghan Whigs' catalogue. While it is certainly brilliant, it is really no better than their stellar final two (`[[ASIN:B000002HLG Black Love]]' in 1996 and `[[ASIN:B00000DFRU 1965]]' in 1998). That said, once you hook into the searing assault of this album, you will never ever forget it.ng guitar of `What Jail is Like' (I warned you, if cornered, I'll scratch my way out of this pen) before we hear the woman's side of the story in a suitably bruised vocal from Scrawl's Marcy Mays (Hurt me baby/ I flinch so when you do/ Your kisses scourge me) in the wrenching ballad, `My Curse'.

B005DZMP00|5.0|1. Dumbest commentary ever... even if you were AT Bickershaw, and I don't care anyway, whining about the packaging of this release is absurd... after the first verse in Other One, Phil ABUSES his bass, makes it sound like a frantic rhinoceros with an attitude problem, and people are complaining that the cardboard packaging isn't up to their standards?? Wow... talk about not having any knowledge of this band... I suppose none of you have ever seen the original cover of Europe 72 on LP, which was designed to do two things: (1) hold the albums inside, and (2) it was a TABLE, and I won't be specific but there's a reason it was a trifold WHITE table, go find an old vinyl copy and open it up and you'll probably see what I am talking about, and this is why this release is a faithful and utilitarian adaptation of the old one... props to the band for keeping it faithful to the original.<br /><br />2. Someone suggested the \\"sound quality was fair\\"?? Huh??? I have had a 25-year old boom-box-dubbed cassette of Bickershaw handed down from who knows where, and to me this release is a revelation, blew me away... guess it's relative, but there is NO WAY in the world the sound quality of ANY tracks here is average... I assume every one of your recordings is pristine first-generation digitally-mastered whatnot... talk about nitpicking... the most incredible Dead recording I have ever heard in my life is a who-knows-what-generation audience tape, and you call this \\"fair\\"??<br /><br />3. There's a blown tuning in \\"Other One\\" and Bobby fixes it mid-jam... I think I'm seriously going to puke... whoever made this statement knows nothing, NOTHING about this band... not to be weird, but there are at least 10 instances of tuning within a jam I can name of the top of my head, even post-Keith & Donna, it was not just the Dead but MANY bands of this era who branched out and played that way... even bluegrass musicians do it, jazz musicians do it (ALOT), and to say \\"this is terrible because there weren't stomp boxes available yet\\" is like ragging on a 1957 Chevy for being less smooth of a ride because there weren't modern suspension systems invented yet. Wha?<br /><br />4. And my personal favorite, \\"it doesn't have that Europe 72 vibe\\". Strange, since each song was from the Europe 72 tour, they were all recorded in Europe, in the year 1972, just amazing how no one picked up on that, I think it's in the title.<br /><br />So I guess the way I remember the Dead's fan-base from the shows I attended way back when is pretty much gone, things were rough around the edges, nothing was perfect, and people had a sense of humor, none of these things are evident here.<br /><br />By the way, we need the Sugar Mag> Caution> Saturday Night from Hamburg IN ITS ENTIRETY for Vol 3, please... I'm begging you, Phil is on MARS on that sequence, he's playing like Bootsy Collins during the Caution and Pigpen is on FIRE. I will do whatever it takes.available yet\\" is like ragging on a 1957 Chevy for being less smooth of a ride because there weren't modern suspension systems invented yet. Wha?  4.

B004Q7DQLS|3.0|Review @ 10%<br /><br />Having read the first 10% of Dragon Bound, I am loving it.  The book opens with \\"Pia was blackmailed into commiting a crime more suicidal than she could possibly have imagined, and she had no one to blame but herself\\" and I was instantly engaged.  My favorite part of the plot so far is the theft itself, where she was blackmailed into stealing from the dragon's hoard, but she left to her discretion, the item she selects is not quite what her blackmailer suspects.<br /><br />Clearly, there are some mysteries around Pia that we don't know yet.  What type of Wyr is she?  What power does she have that helped her succeed with the theft?<br /><br />Review @ 40%<br /><br />Having read through 40% of the book, I'm still enjoying it.  I really liked that Dragos had his tream tracking Pia, but he hid and kept the note from the Pia's theft and is clearly as much intrigued as angered by her.  Without giving too much away, much of this part of the book is running from bad guys, getting caught, escaping and running some more.<br /><br />Review @ 100%<br /><br />That last half of the book transitioned from an Urban Fantasy chase novel to an Erotic Romance that happened to be in a Fantasy setting.  While I did enjoy the book overall and can recommend it, I think many fantasy genre readers will simply find the overly detailed erotic scenes as a distraction, rather than an enhancement, to the story.<br /><br />This is too bad (from my perspective), because I really like the world and the characters and if some of the explicit scenes had been edited to be more implied (for example, more similar to the way relationships are handled in the Liaden series of books by Lee and Miller), I would probably be looking forward to more books in this series.  I liked the character of Tricks and the various bodyguard Gryphons, as well as Quentin and can imagine good independent stories about each of them, but only if they leaned more Fantasy and less towards Erotic fiction.<br /><br />Learn more about my 10/40/100 review at: [...].]

B000PMLFRA|5.0|Great characters, fantastic stories and they all look fantastic in blu-ray.  It's always fun to see Harrison Ford in the original, as he and the others seem to have fantastic onscreen chemistry.  A great set and if you have the new fangled blu-ray - this is a must buy.
B00004Y32O|5.0|I have been collecting vinyl for years , and to have just about everything Madonna has recorded on vinyl. I am still pleased and amazed that it is rare but possible to still collect Madonna on vinyl. This selection is great as it also has \\"American Pie\\" A cool record to add to my collection. Must have if you are a Madonna fan.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Just watched the movie yesterday, it was fantastic!!!!! I was severely disappointed with Part Two of TF but part 3 made me a fan again.    MUST SEE for all TF fans
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Dismal, just dismal.  Why did Guy Pearce, who is usually pretty careful about which movies he signs up for, take on this disaster?  Must have been the lure of a good payday, or the opportunity to run and jump around as a modern action hero.  They should be required to say it's INSPIRED by the HG Wells novel, since they chenge so much of the plot, completely jettisoning any of the social critique that was in the book and the 1960 classic. And even that might be okay, if they didn't decide to jazz it up with all kinds of digital special effects.  I looked forward to seeing this, but it had no soul, just empty action/adventure.  But, what about that blond girl in 2030 NYC with the bicycle, who talks to Pearce when he stops the machine for the first time?  I actually thought that might develop into some kind of sub-plot, and after sitting through this whole travesty, I kind of wish it had.  Stick with the 1960 version.  It may not have that modern sheen, but it has soul and intelligence.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|definitely one of the most amazing movies i have watched, it has action, and amazing fight scenes, i loved every minute of this movie, and i recommend it to all of my friends. this was just truly amazing, and the actors and director did a fantastic job.
B004PKOKSO|5.0|This is John Scofield at his best : lyrical,  harmonically out-yet in , &  bending chords / notes as only 'Sco' can do ! This album is so full of beauty, and soul - it  is the kind of listen that makes you gasp with awe .

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Wasn't sure if the 2nd season could keep up with the excellence of the 1st season, but it did so and more.  It was intense, had great character development, and plenty of surprises. The artistry of the photography was outstanding and helped build suspence for the ending episode. And the ending was mind blowing. It left me thinking for it for days. And it was 3 weeks before I was ready to watch the 3rd season.
B004E2XAFW|4.0|This is a great album from WT. Their sound is nothing like previously recorded. It still attains the dark melodramatic score so no worries. I recommend this album to new listeners.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|It was time. Now we got them to their well deserved glory.  I'm a huge fan of Pink Floyd from almost 35 years now, and I've waited for a remastering that was really appropriate since I turned from LP to CD. Now the time has come.  This final release of the Pink Floyd catalog finally makes justice to the music of Floyd. Now everything sounds exactly just like it always should have sound.   Reading the other reviews I discovered that there are people dissatisfied with the sound, and others even claim that there is no difference between the CDs of the 90's and those of this edition, as if the remastering work was not done.  Well, this is absurd and totally false. Openly. Unless their evaluation criterion is based on poor PC speakers.   I can only think about this possibility, really, because I don't want to think that they are not able to catch the big difference. The difference in terms of sound is really too big to be missed.  I have had both \\"Oh by the way\\" (which had no new remasters, so there was almost no difference with the editions of 1992 and 1994) and the releases from 1992 and 1994 - and here is really a world of difference between the CDs released in 1992 and those issued in 1994.  In 1992 there was a so called \\"remastering\\" editions and here are the conclusions:  1. A Saucerful Of Secrets: terrible sound as the very first release on CD of the album, sound dull and muffled (while the remastering on \\"Shine On\\" box released the same year is wonderful; I don't know why such things happen)  2. Meddle: it was an ADD like previous editions, good but nothing more  3. The Dark Side Of The Moon: just enough  4. Wish You Were Here: like the previous editions ADD  5. Animals: Poor, absolutely in need of a remastering work  In 1994, the rest of the catalog was released in a so called \\"re-mastered\\" edition (so I guess there is a big difference between \\"remastering\\" and \\"re-mastered\\"):  1. The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn: very good  2. More: very good  3. Ummagumma: verygood  4. Atom Heart Mother: very good  5: Obscured By The Clouds: very good  6. The Wall: very good  7: The Final Cut: very good  To get excellent release of Animals I had to buy the Japanese edition.   In 2003 DSOTM was released in SACD and the result was absolutely superb.  In 2004 an almost new version of The Final Cut was released, remastered with the addition of \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\", and the difference with the 1994 release is enormous.  Oh By The Way brings the latest remastering as they were already on the market (with the addition of a touch of remasters for \\"The Piper...\\" and \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\"), but nothing new, really. I was very sorry for the way \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" and \\"Animals\\" sounded, two of my favorite albums.  Buying the Discovery Edition I found with great satisfaction and relief that everything, really everything is perfectly and painstakingly remastered, as well as the campaign promised.  I listened very carefully to all 14 albums (and I mean ALL) with headphones and the sound is simply stunning, powerful, fresh and crystal clear. I even found out sonic details that I had never noticed (remember I've listened to Pink Floyd albums for 35 years).  Of course, from a packaging point of view I expected more: more pictures, more history behind each release, some of the original inside pictures are lost, and also the booklet by Storm Thorgeson is not much, so there is no great treasures to offer to the hungry mouth, but anyway...\\"Oh by the way\\" was perfect from this point of view: new photos were not considered, but all the vinyl covers were exactly reproduced.   So what? The sound was not perfect. Well, you can't have anything, do you?  From my personal point of view, if you love Pink Floyd music you should be interested FIRST in MUSIC, and the way it sounds. The way it reaches your soul deep inside.  Now it does at its best.  The music of Pink Floyd has finally returned to his true greatness.

B005MW68RK|5.0|I have only one thing to say about this disc, one word  BOMBASTIC !!!!!!. I have several Beth Hart CD's she is just one of those ladies that remains under the radar, similar Amanda Marshall  Canadian Singer) Sass Jordan, etc.<br /><br />These ladies are not your X Factor, American Idol smeared in gooey, pop slime, they are the real deal, chance takers.<br /><br />Beth had to be rocked to sleep listening to Janis Joplin as she is just the most chilling Ghost of Janis, I have ever heard. She tapped out Joe to make this album, and I pray to God that they have a follow up in the can!!!!!<br /><br />Chocolate Jesus is beyond the best track, just stellar!!!!<br /><br />Beth, Joe GOD BLESS YOU BOTH for making real music, real feelings, real emotions.<br /><br />VIVA HART BONAMASSA !!!<br /><br />Too bad, she could not get Glenn Hughes to fill in on some backing vocals!!!! One could only dream of how that would sound!!!!

0553801473|1.0|I read each of the books in this series as it was released, and have not bothered to read them again. I thoroughly enjoyed the first three and remember reading them gleefully from cover to cover. Even \\"Feast\\" had some fine moments, but it's slow pace was somewhat of a breather after the previous book which seemed to make sense, like a cool down after a long run.<br />This book is like a nap after a cool down after a long run! I can't count the times I've had to re-read portions after I realized the words, paragraphs, and even chapters were so unremarkable I didn't even extract any useful information about the story from them. It's akin to driving home from work and then not remembering how you arrived at home, as if you were on autopilot.<br />The constant descriptions of food served, lineage of minor characters, memories of major characters and endless repetition of catch phrases was painful, boring, and generally hard to slog through. I'm near the very end of this book now, and may have to start flaying my own fingers to remain awake enough to see it behind me!<br />Perhaps after my dinner (lamprey pie, crackling pig, caramel preying mantis, brown bread, brown ale, brown wine, brownies...) I will finish this tome. I remember long ago when I was just a lad my great Uncle Morris Festicule (on my Father's side) who happened to own a tannery just South of Flintstark and enjoyed a good lathering by his Sister's maid after the Great Arbor Day celebration was traveling by...zzzzzzzz<br /><br />Wha? Huh? Oh, forgive me, I just read another page...<br /><br />Now for some fine red Sangria, none of that boxed crap!
B004LROMSO|3.0|Maybe it's me. But I was hoping that this series would be a great take on the legend of King Arthur. However, I found myself bored to death most of the time, mostly due to an inexperienced cast that would be better off in ads for Abercrombie and Fitch. There's not enough respect for the source material--which does NOT need revising at all. The production values are just fine, but between the script and the terrible acting, you end up wishing Merlin would just blow everyone to bits. The series lasted one season; I know why!
1908117230|5.0|Just got the book in the mail.  Lovely pictures and interesting recipes.  Clear and easy instructions.  There is picture for each recipe. Can't wait to start baking french macarons.  Waiting a few years for the English translation is so worth it.  I got my new book for $28 last week, and I can't believe that some sellers now is selling it for $87.  What the $#%%%^!!!!  Just wait and pretty soon more good deal will be posted by honest sellers.
B005DI97S0|5.0|I \\"L O V E D\\" this book. Very intriguing with its ideas and topics, highly unusual AND controversial to say the least. In short, an awesome story of the vampire chronicles that just continues to mesmerize its readers. Same series, totally different direction. A. Rice is a talented author. Hard to put this down.  Don't get hung up on the religious theories or fact (however you regard it as) and the twist Anne Rice puts to them.  It is about the story, it is a story, a FICTIONAL story, she's not trying to re write the bible.  It is purely fictional entertainment.  Loved this book.

0394826817|5.0|When you see this book in the box it looks like a single story book, but when you open its pages you find a treasury of multiple stories of manners. The illustrations are great and the book is typical Richard Scarry. Such a reminder of his books from my childhood.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I typicaly spend less than ten bucks on my ipod and adroid machines in a year. To be honest I dont think I would have bought this, but if I did, the money would not have been a waste.  The game's faults are easily overlooked, and it runs great on my 7inch tablet screen. I had some trouble every now and then with cutting shorter ropes, and some of the levels are reliant upon luck to get 100% completion(all three stars), rather than having a set solution. Overall, its a fun game thats just challenging enough to keep it interesting with quick levels that make it great on work breaks. You will probably be compelled to play the game because its fun, not because you want to kill time.

All of the ingredients seem to be present - fine writing (Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff), fast paced direction by Michael Cuesta, and a very strong cast including Claire Danes in one of her most challenging roles, Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin.<br /><br />The concept is very much in The public eye at this point - a study of how terrorists are followed and found and how the US Intelligence Service functions. The first episode introduces all of the main characters and fleshes out in a single episode the clues for all of the complicated substories and subplots that the series promises.  After eight years absence Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) was thought MIA but is discovered in a filthy cell in Iraq ad brought back to the US in a Marine Victory parade.  Brody had been captured with another Marine who was beaten to death and the reasons why Brody survived and his fellow Marine didn't makes CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) suspicious - could Brody have sold out to Iraqi bad guy Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) and that is how he survived torture and captivity?  Anderson is driven to see if her concept is correct, gains the backing of her boss Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin, and successfully fills Brody's house with surveillance equipment so his every move can be observed. The sidebars include the fact that in Brody's absence his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) has fallen in love with Brody's best friend, and in the intense questioning and shock of being back home Brody begins to remember events of his capture and imprisonment including the fact that he was the one who beat his fellow Marine to death at the behest of Abu Nasir.  Brody's physical condition and body language also give signs that perhaps Anderson's concepts that Brody sold out to Abu Nazir and is plotting an attack on America are viable.  The stinger is that Anderson is discovered as being on antipsychotic medication since a young girl - making her contributions to intelligence under suspicion.  And so we are left with many possibilities for stories that will play out until this season's run ends in December.<br /><br />It appears that this is a very strong series, but then some of the premiere shows of other series held great promise only to become ho-hum as the season ended.  Let's hope this isn't the case: the three main characters are so strong it would be a shame if their stories became diluted. Grady Harp, October 11n America are viable.

B005J4TLQG|5.0|Comedian Joe Cornish's debut film is a fun, inventive and highly original creature feature with a serious social message at its heart. The theme of Alien domination of Earth has been done to death in recent years, typically with massively overblown CGI effects, but Cornish's British low-budget debut takes a very different approach from the Hollywood blockbuster, localising the alien attack to one grimy tower block of a South London council estate.  A gang of South London hoodies mug nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) on bonfire night as she returns home from her shift, but are interrupted when an object crashes into a nearby parked car. Gang-leader Moses is attacked and bitten by a creature hiding within and, enraged, pursues it to a nearby shelter to beat it to death, while Sam takes the opportunity to escape. The gang agree that that the creature must be from outer space (\\"that's a alien bruv, believe!\\"), and parade the corpse through the streets like a trophy, returning to the hang-out of resident drug-dealer and horticulturalist Ron (played by a long-haired, shell-suit wearing Nick Frost). However, it is not long before much larger, more aggressive beasts begin to fall from the sky, drawn to the tower block where Moses and his friends reside. Later in the film, Cornish offers up a very sound biological explanation for the invasion, rather than avoiding the issue like most brainless blockbusters.  Sam is left justifiably shaken, shocked and angry at her attack, but eventually comes to rely on her assailants as her protectors as they face up to responsibility; a mutual respect developing between them. One character early on describes the kids as `***king monsters'. Indeed they are, to begin with at any rate. This leftfield (though hardly new) approach seems to have irked some viewers who clearly like their heroes to be whiter then white - as though life was that simple; as though the line between good and evil was so well defined. Cornish's well-made and optimistic pointis that nobody is beyond redemption. In Attack the Block there is no glorification of the street violence that has become so relevant in the UK today, nor is there a patronising moral; only the central message that actions have consequences. Cornish is also careful to remind us throughout that despite everything our protagonists are, after all, still only children.    The young unknown cast is excellent; fresh and natural, and particularly the performance of John Boyega, thoroughly believable as villain turned hero, Moses. There are no terrible fake accents either - Cornish uses local kids as his protagonists, using local lingo.   Comparisons with Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead are inevitable, but unwarranted; they're quite different films. The characters in ATB are not comedic ones, and though the film has been made with plenty of wit and humour it is in fact at times a quite serious horror-thriller. Cornish is not scared to despatch some of his young actors to let us know he means business. In some ways it reminds me more of the early films of John Carpenter, which is no mean compliment. The film is full of neat touches and tips its hat to other sci-fi and cult films. The kids themselves live in `Wyndham House', a reference to the author of the classic novel `Day of the Triffids', and watch out for some nods to Spielberg's E.T, among others.  Cornish wrings absolutely everything from his £9 million budget, and is to be applauded for his creativity. Perhaps the climax could have benefitted from the extravagance that a few extra million pounds could bring, but it doesn't matter because part of ATB's charm is its small scale. The creatures themselves are extremely effective; jet black shadows with the majority of emphasis on rows of razor sharp teeth, luminous in the dark, where most of the action takes place. There's very little CGI; the creatures and their movements are actually mostly portrayed by a man in a suit. ATB's pacing is also spot-on, with a series ofexhilarating action scenes and chase sequences, and at times it's heart-pounding stuff, aided by a thumping soundtrack by Steven Price and Basement Jaxx.    The blu-ray quality in terms of both picture and audio is superb, and there are some fine extras on the disc too, including a very interesting featurette on the how the aliens were designed, created and filmed.   Though not quite perfect, and undoubtedly not to everybody's taste, this is a thoroughly excellent genre film, bursting with energy and creativity, and for me a solid 9/10. I loved it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Hi there. Excelent work on this movies. The menu is awesome, and the movies are more clear, the color are more vivid. Although I have to say, in the first trilogy, the picture of planet are more like that, pictures, good ones, but its not fell like video. Also, there are moments of green and purple saturation and somre reflex of those colors. But, still, excelent pack, awesome movies, sound is perfect, very good. You must have this
B000NYT1M6|3.0|Bruder has a superb eye for detail in the creation of this truck, which is what attracted me to it as a collector of diecast and plastic models. For me the features like opening doors and adjustable mirrors are great. But I purchased the Bruder Mack dump truck for static display. Does it have the durability to stand up long term to heavy duty construction jobs with a 6 year old as the foreman of his sandbox construction site? I rather doubt it. The all steel construction toys of old lasted for years and many are now valuable as collectibles because they survived so long. This toy looks great and could probably manage carpet play at Grandma's house but that is going to be about it. However if you buy a Bruder product knowing these things going in as I have, then I think a person will be happy with the product.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This app was how I discovered Amazon's app of the day. I got this when it was free and I love it. It's a little hard to put down. This is an amazing game so far and I REALLY like the skills system. My only qualm is that the touch controls are a little rough and I can't seem to get rid of the \\"Menu\\" and \\"Map\\" buttons at the top of the screen which make it really hard for me to click to go somewhere near the edge of the screen. Overall, I LOVE this game. Thanks so much =D
B001IBC9A4|5.0|The French string quartet Quatuor &Eacute;b&egrave;ne plays so very intimately and produce such a well integrated sound that it seems almost unnecessary to list the individual components of this quartet, but then again they are so fine that not knowing their names would seem incomplete. The members are Pierre Colombet and Gabriel Le Magadure, violins, Mathieu Herzog, viola, and Raphaël Merlin, cello.  Their united performances on this extraordinary recital are the kind that if heard on the radio in the car make the drier pull over so as not to miss a nuance.  This is an exceptional ensemble.<br /><br />The recital opens with Claude Debussy's String Quartet in G-minor, op. 10 - airbourne and intoxicatingly played.  The Debussy is followed by one of the finest performances of the Gabriel Faur&eacute; String Quartet  in E-minor, op. 121 - completely enchanting in the facility these young men own as technique.  The final work on the recital is Maurice Ravel's  String Quartet in F-major. There is something about the manner in which each of these masterworks is performed that places the listener in a near trance: the music itself is sensuous and seductive and the Quatuor &Eacute;b&egrave;ne offers all of the sensuality and fragrance of this music while at the same time continually amazing the listener with their facility.  For this listener this is the finest recording of these three works as played together.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, October 11
0061353248|3.0|It`s a good book overall. It gives interesting approaches on situations in which people don`t act rationally, hence, they might not maximize their utility in terms of what a hard economic behavior should be, in an accessible way to everyone.  Anyway, some experiments presented don`t seem to have real statistical difference in the results (they are presented very seriously, all of them include control groups and have no doubt there were statistical tests done, but it would be good to have more information about that, since some differences seem pretty small to get conclusions) and some of the experiments have predictable outcomes (in any event, it`s nice to have formal demonstrations around them).  Also, it seemed that the author sometimes misses the utility an individual might get simply by following social norms and not having to \\"look as a freak\\" to others. Maybe, taking that into account, the decisions are not that irrational after all...  Having said all this, I do recommend people to read the book, but just don`t have high expectations on it.
1451629184|4.0|I agree this was a very difficult book to read, especially the rapes,and  molestation. I   commend her mother and the strength that she must have given to Jaycee before she was taken, without those memories I feel that her time with those monsters would have been more horrific than they were. Jaycee is a very strong young woman who did what she had to do to survive. She and her children are in my prayers, as well as the prayer that justice will be served, and this monster is not allowed back into society to ever harm another child. Jaycee's love for her children is very obvious in this book. She is truly blessed to have them. Sometimes something good can come from bad, and I see her daughters as the shining light in the dark time of her life. Stay strong Jaycee!  You will go far il life.

0553801473|1.0|I had enjoyed this series from the start, but have been growing discontented with the repeating themes and lack of originality in the plots, characters and ideas presented.  Seeing one of the reviews that referenced Martin as the American Tolkien.... I definately do not agree with that.<br /><br />The author increasingly resorts to the same characteristics.... kill off key characters that he has spent significant parts of previous books introducing and building.... reference: young wolf, stark, tywin lannister and many many other.  Then you have the characters that get brought back from the dead in one manner or another(Dondarion, Caitlin Stark, Benjen Stark, etc.), the characters that are maybe dead or we have been told are dead... and no, I won't spoil by listing the repeats in this book.<br /><br />My opinion of book 4 and now book 5 is that the author is so caught up in the idea of multiple multiple books that he has ceased to move the story forward.  The same tricks and patterns come again and again. This book could be skipped and with an intro chapter cover all the real changes between book 4 and book 6.  I was disappointed and saddened by the poor quality of the book and the demise of the series.  I do not recommend it or any others by this author.  It lacks the originality and style of his early books.<br /><br />I suggest you move on to someone with more original ideas or that is able to tell a story to a conclusion and then tell a second story
B002I0J5FG|5.0|i played SoTC on PS2 when it originally came out and fell in love with it the world that team ICO makes are magnificent. SoTC has you battling 16 colossi in hope of bringing back life to a girl whose relating to you is not known. ICO has you trying to escape a island with a mysterious girl in hopes of getting back to the mainland. Both games are great they look better than ever if you've never played either before on the PS2 do yourself a favor and buy them now

I am going to look for something else.

B00517ESFK|5.0|This episode is one of the best in the entire four seasons of the show. The show CHUCK always likes to end a season strong and this episode is no exception. This episode culminates the last four years of Chucks involvement with both the CIA and the woman that he loves; Sarah Walker. It is a race against time for Chuck to save Sarah life from death by radiation poisoning as he battles both the CIA and Volkoff industries to get Sarah  the antidote. This episode has so much going on in it that they even had to shorten the opening credits. In usual CHUCK fashion there is also plenty of heartfelt moments  and comedy. The ending is a \\"must see\\" for any fan of the show.
0553801473|4.0|I'm a big fan of George R. R. Martin. Since discovering the A Song of Ice and Fire series many years ago, I've anxiously awaited (and awaited...) each new book in the series. I read his blog daily. And so I'm probably a little biased. Much has been thoughtfully covered in the preceding reader reviews, so I'll just offer up my 2 cents worth of random thoughts and anecdotes.<br /><br />Firstly, four stars. This isn't a perfect book. As others have mentioned, the plot perhaps meanders a bit, and the consistency of some characters can be justifiably questioned. And yet, from the perspective of this longtime fan, the sum of the parts remains as brilliant as expected. I savored each page, soaking up each new detail and happening, and anxiously tried to ignore the voice in the back of my head reminding me that it was one page closer to the end. The return to GRRM's world felt great!<br /><br />Prior to the release of this book, I was riding the subway and noticed a lady reading A Clash of Kings. I couldn't resist the temptation to reach out and ask how she was enjoying it. To my surprise (this was the first person I've met that didn't read and fall in love GRRM's series), she said she found it overrated compared to \\"other\\" books, poorly written, and aimed at the gender that wasn't hers.  She also claimed to be a big fantasy fan, and when I asked which books she enjoyed more, she named only The Lord of The Rings. Hard to argue there :)<br /><br />I was reminded of this encounter while reading A Dance with Dragons. I've never thought of the series as being especially geared towards one sex or the other, but ADWD did seem particularly violent. Years have passed since I've read the previous books and I can't recall if they were as descriptively cringe-inducing. This is more food for thought for me than anything else. I'm certainly not bothered by it, and I'd argue that it adds to the contextual realism and depth of character in most examples. At the same time, it may give me pause before recommending this book to my girlfriend or that lady on the subway should we meet again.<br /><br />Lastly and leastly, while wading through reader reviews, I was shocked to find as much vitriolic negativity as I did. I have no worry with the 3 star average - as pure standalone fiction, this probably isn't as strong as the first books - but if you've journeyed this far, how can you not relish being back in this fantastic world that GRRM presents us? And what good would any review be without a little zany conspiracy theory? Here it is: it almost feels as if there were some collective campaign to spam this reader reviews section with harsh complaints and poor reviews.<br /><br />I enjoyed every minute of it and can't wait for more.
1400064287|5.0|Once, I had the extraordinary honor to meet Mother Teresa.  She was attending the dedication of a Missionaries of Charity convent in Brooklyn.  The day was hot, the church was packed... everyone stretching their necks to see Nobel Peace Prize winner, some believe future Saint, Mother Teresa.  Her presence was so ordinary, it was striking.  She is quoted in Made to Stick as having said, \\"If I look at the mass, I will never act.  If I look at the one, I will.\\"<br /><br />By the time you've been on the planet several decades you begin to wonder why some great ideas don't get the traction they should, while other, totally moronic ideas do.  How is it possible that the professional debater lost to the good ole boy?  How has the national debt exploded to $15 trillion dollars?  Why are people questioning whether the social safety net is fair?  Alternatively, there are those persistent ideas that are altogether false!  \\"9/11 was an inside job,\\" or \\"The President is an Islamic terrorist from Kenya.\\"  In Made to Stick, brothers Chip and Dan Heath help the reader understand why ideas \\"stick.\\"<br /><br />An invaluable lesson of Made to Stick is to understand the different ways we approach problems by virtue of our experience - what has already stuck in our minds.<br /><br />There is a dynamic tension between those with experience and those with new ideas.  Those who have been with your agency forever and who may have written the book, sometimes literally, are often shackled with the \\"Curse of Knowledge.\\"  In their minds, they may have much more to figure out about the problem than those who approach the same problem fresh.  The authors liken it to being able to tap out a tune playing in your head.  To you it makes perfect sense (you hear the melody of \\"America the Beautiful\\") but to someone else, all they hear is tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap.  Overcoming this kind of disconnect is a challenge addressed in Made to Stick.<br /><br />Especially when the economy is struggling, sticky ideas need to reflect the principles that matter, viz., those that address your agency's mission and vision.  \\"We help people with developmental disabilities live richer lives.\\"  This idea is expressed, embodied, told and retold, every day, hourly, by those working at the NYS Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, who have responsibilities of direct care for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  Why does this idea stick?<br /><br />In Made to Stick, the authors discuss many sticky ideas, including Jared, the guy who lost 245 pounds by eating sandwiches from the fast food chain, Subway.  As such, you might think that Made to Stick is a book about public relations, but it is more.  Many agencies have a \\"Jared.\\"  He may be real-life and his name Bernard, or Judy; or fictional, like Lynnie or Homan (all of whom I have written about elsewhere).<br /><br />Spectacular stories stick because of what the authors describe as their SUCCESs:  They are:  simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, stories.  Master these steps and your ideas will stick.<br /><br />Importantly, and simply (!), spectacular stories stick because someone notices.  Someone cares, recognizes the idea is unique, and takes the initiative (perhaps, risk) to tell the story... and the idea sticks.  ...You know, really, Jared lost 245 pounds!  Maybe eating at Subway is a good idea!  After a brief departure in 2005, Subway sales dropped 10%!  Now, whenever Subway sales are sluggish, you find him back on TV.  And, look!

0425241505|3.0|Bought this after several AMAZON reviews stating it was \\"So awesome I had to read it again!!\\" It also received kudos from J.R. Ward. This is a new series called \\"The Elder Races\\" Creatures/Wyrs that are somewhat a cross between mythology and TRUE BLOOD (Sookie Stackhouse) - There are Wyr-Dragons, Wyr-Gargoyles, Wyr-Muskrats - you get the point. Our hero (a Wyr-Dragon named Dragos) was created before the universe itself (riiiight) and is also a corporate GOD who catches our heroin stealing from his lair. Oh but she wasn't stealing - she was \\"borrowing\\" and her prized trophy?? A PENNY- that's right break into a 200 billion-year-old dragon lair for a penny. The story has merit, but our heroine (Pia) does not. Pia is a lost vegetarian orphan that doesn't know who she is or why/what she is running from- but she will do it until her dying breath damn it! There were several times I almost put this book back on my shelf - but I was determined to finish (I hate to leave anything unread)in the end I thought the story pulled together and I found it somewhat enduring. My mental jury is still out on whether I will indulge in the sequel. FYI - The cover is really cheesy and looks nothing like how Dragos is described in the book. The guy on the cover looks like some marine who is a victim of circumstance.
0316098329|5.0|I just finished Room. Wow..I have a 3 year old son, and often while I was reading I thought of him. The author nailed the 5 year old narrative voice. It was a bit weird getting used to reading the first few chapters, but the story unfolded and I could not put the book down. I really felt so much for Jack. And, only good writing can make me feel that much for an imagined character. Through 5 year old Jack's perspective (albeit a boy who lived his first 5 years in an 11 by 11 foot room) I was able to step outside myself and imagine life from my son's eyes. While the story line was horrific(with limited if almost no horrifying details), it was very beautiful. I have a lot of respect for the author simply because she really understood life from a child's eyes..And, that is hard to do for many of us.
B000001EGA|5.0|My father was an Army Lieutenant here in Brazil and he was transferred to this small town. After some time my family and I followed suit. As time went by I made new acquaintances and friends. Soon everyone learned I was a big fan of Elton John's. Then, one day, a girl named Natalia sent out word she had a cassette by Elton she wanted to trade with me. I went to her workplace and she dropped it right into my hands.   I couldn't believe my eyes. The cover was incredibly beautiful and I couldn't wait to hear it. I got home, locked the room where the small and lousy cassette player was and heard it all. Three out of the nine songs I already knew, i.e. \\"Someone Saved My Life\\", \\"We All Fall In Love Sometimes\\" and \\"Writing\\". Though I loved these songs I wanted to hear the ones I didn't know.  And \\"Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy\\" was well above what I expected. It was full of magic sounds like chimes, bells, mellotrons, drums, great piano playing, beautifully arranged vocals, and Elton's perfect performance.  Though, it was with great satisfaction I realized I had to listen to this cassette some other times to absorb all that new information, I had to leave it for later for I had a soccer match to play with my newly made friends. The album and its magical sounds could not leave my head though, and I was so inspired by it that I even scored a goal! True!  So, I hope this review is of any help to you, especially if you are a hardcore fan of Elton John's classic years, and have not listened to this album yet.
0140544518|5.0|You may think you know the story of \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" but there are two sides to every story. The story begins with A. Wolf explaining that the real story is about a sneeze and a cup of sugar. He was making a birthday cake for his dear old granny and ran out of sugar. He also happened to have a terrible sneezing cold.<br /><br />Mr. Wolf walked down the street to borrow a cup of sugar from his neighbor. The neighbor happened to be a pig. The pig also happened to  have a house made of straw.<br />Mr. Wolf knocked on the door but the pig did not answer. Unfortunately, the wolf felt a sneeze coming on. He huffed and snuffed and sneezed a great sneeze. The whole darn house fell down and the little pig was dead. The wolf did not want to let a perfectly good ham go to waste, so he ate the pig for dinner.<br />Mr. Wolf had a similar experience at another neighbor's house. He finally came to a brick house and knocked on the door. The pig was rude and insulted the wolf's granny. When the cops arrived, the wolf was huffing and puffing and sneezing and making a real scene.<br />The story ends with the wolf behind behind bars and a police officer (a pig, of course) was guarding his cell. He had been framed.<br /><br />I read this book aloud many times when I worked as an elementary school librarian. The children could hear this same story over and over again...they always loved it. The wolf is so convincing that he almost convinces the readers that he really was framed and it was all an accident. This is a perfect book for a \\"point-of-view\\" lesson. It was fun to ask the children to compare the original \\"Story of the Three Little Pigs\\" with this book. The final question was always, \\"Who do you believe and why?\\"

0891419063|5.0|I agree with those who say it is the best description of front-line infantry combat to come out of World War II.  The author brilliantly describes the constant fear and the degree of human degradation imposed on human beings by mid-twentieth century warfare.  The author is an exceptional writer who is clear  and easy to read yet vivid.  If you want to read just one about World War II, I recommend this one.

It is hard to pick one scene that is the best. I think my favorite scene is when they pull the curtain and Debbie Reynolds is singing behind it! Such a great payback! The slapstick singing between Gene Kelly & Donald O'Connor is fascinating to watch.  How did they put all of that together? You're in for a treat if you have never watched it. Pop up some popcorn put your feet up and prepare to be entertained!
0385344325|3.0|Too many words written about Reacher moving from point A to B. Too much description of nature. Too many words about the sex.

The bottom line is that Moore ultimately uses shock to distract viewers from THE REAL ISSUES!  Wow.  I've watched all this guy's movies and thought him to be a beacon; a rebel.  I now see him as, at the very least, a comedian ,and at most, the exact opposite of my former impression.<br /><br />Moore, like everyone else, focused on systems that don't have populations or INHABITED land masses REMOTELY akin to the USA. By USA comparisons, the populations and INHABITED landmasses of Canada, Britain, France and Cuba combined are TINY (just under half of US Pop).<br /><br />Ironically, I've been to and have received healthcare in all the countries he's mentioned, except Canada.  France and Britain CONTINUE to receive royalties from the many nation-states they've conquered and colonized; Canada being one of them.  Their colonial history and population size contributes to their approach to care. It's not good or bad, just is.<br /><br />In Cuba, there is a very simple and glaring fee structure; One for Cubans; their Caribbean and Latin neighbors and then one for everyone else (namely the world super powers).  Had those folks not been with Mr. Moore, they'd paid more for their services.  Just that simple.  Not what's paid in the US necessarily, but more like $30 for $120 instead of FIVE CENTS!<br /><br />Also, Moore's documentaries perpetuate the us/them; corporation/Main Street; predator/victim mentality that plagues the US (esp.  racism and political correctness). Insurance companies pay off a lot more than congressmen (as does Big Pharma) to ensure their bottom line is met. Yes, it was portrayed in movie, but not comparable to the impact it has on the health care industry.  Politicians, marketing agents, insurance execs, physicians, nurses, social workers, adjusters, accountants, health techs, customer service reps...it's so many people benefiting from the way things are who are fine with it all, until, they get sick...<br /><br />Perhaps most of the hyperboles in the film simply drive home some key points, but there are so many gaps in areas that could have been transparent that this seems more like a slapstick spoof of a serious documentary.<br /><br />Such films are a true testament to how ignorance on a matter can be easily manipulated, since most Americans haven't experienced health care in these countries. But then Moore's \\"allowed\\" to continue making his little films the way that he does, because he's not REALLY disclosing revolutionary information.  Quite literally.CENTS!<br /><br />Also, Moore's documentaries perpetuate the us/them; corporation/Main Street; predator/victim mentality that plagues the US (esp.  racism and political correctness).

076790592X|2.0|I was asked to read this book for a Sociology class I am currently taking. The class is entitled \\"Death and Dying\\" and deals with loss. We, the students, were asked to read this novel as it \\"changes lives\\" and makes people \\"see how to really be alive.\\" Well, over the course of a hour, I read this book. And, I felt nothing. Not one of the characters in this novel touched me - they were simply words on paper. Indeed, the only truly good thing about this novel is that it is an easy read.   Let me put it this way: everything that is said about \\"living meaningfully\\" means nothing. Indeed, it reads like a Hallmark card. Everything that is said within this novel is something everyone already knows. And, the idea of \\"living meaningfully\\" is never fully explored. Forgive yourself and others? Live each day like its your last? Okay. . .sure. But, what else? What about living \\"more spiritually,\\" well that's never fully explained either. Morrie and Mitch are consumed with the idea that our culture doesn't allow people to be \\"whole\\"; that our culture isn't what it should be. But, neither ever says what \\"being whole\\" looks like. Indeed, it's during these types of conversations that Mitch comes off as a. . .well, hipster jerk.   The whole novel reads like something you'd hear on the Hallmark channel or an episode of Oprah or Dr. Phil. Only, it's more profound because a dying man said the things in the novel. The ideas of living \\"meaningfully\\", \\"spiritually\\", etc are all empty. This is meant to be a relevant and honest look at dying and loss, but it comes across as pretentious and preachy.
B005IY3DP2|5.0|For me, Velociraptor! is one of the best albums until here in 2011.  Awesome cd !!! I love it.  Track 4 - La Fee Verte sounds like beatle's songs, simply amazing !!!
6305128952|4.0|The movie itself was awesome!  I've seen it before.  Shipping was great and got here earlier than expected.  The only complaint I have was that the audio was not in sych with the video.  I don't know if it was the DVD itself or something going on with my laptop player or laptop audio/video settings.  If you have any ideas, please let me know.  Thanks much!

B000E41MS6|5.0|This is a fine boxed set for lovers of Doctor Who!  It seems amazing that we're already three Doctors into the series reboot, but this takes us back to the beginning.  Seeing Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper finding their chemistry just as the Doctor and Rose do is great fun.
B00005JKJA|4.0|First of all I'd like to thank the other reviewers for explaining this movie.<br />It honestly didn't make a whole lot of sense the first time I watched it.<br />I watched it again after reading some of the spoiler reviews and I liked it a lot better.<br />Brilliant direction.<br />Visuals are gorgeous.<br />Excellent acting.<br />A story that will make very little sense the first time you watch it.<br />It's sort of explained at the end but only a little.<br />It's not a film that will be appreciated by casual movie watchers.<br />I recommend a rental for patient viewers.
B0054N73EY|2.0|I'm sure everyone is a fan of RHCP, but this has to be the weakest album they have.  Nothing new(as far as creativity), and it seems a bit rushed as far as song structure.  I believe there were a few choruses and breaks that had something, but were usually let down by the verse or change-in-to.  Regardless, I own every album and will continue to support them for the musicians they are, but if you're just looking to pick up the new best thing, this album won't cut it.
1401219268|4.0|I heard so much hype about \\"Watchmen\\" over the years that, for a while, I became reluctant to read it - which was stupid of me. When I finally picked it up, I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />And that's pretty remarkable, because I'm no great lover of comic books - though I do enjoy reading Stan Lee's fun 1960s work, and witty stuff like Calvin & Hobbes. I have nothing against comics, exactly, and I do think they're a legit art form; perhaps I just get put off by the violence and relative lack of intelligence found in so many superhero comics. Batman, for example, is cool on the surface but actually constitutes a very disturbing glorification of vigilante justice; his comics also contain shockingly primitive depictions of the mentally ill, as well as unflattering portraits of women (e.g., Poison Ivy, who embodies a whole range of little-boy fantasies and fears about women and sex).<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"Watchmen\\" is like Batman with more of a brain. This comic very intelligently explores the psychology and social impact of superheroes, directly addressing the elements of violence and weird sexuality that spoil mainstream comics for me. Indeed, Watchmen's Rorschach is a more realistic depiction of the Batman figure, who has allowed his obsession with crime to take over his life - even to the extent that he neglects his personal hygiene.<br /><br />Rorschach may be the most interesting character here, but writer Alan Moore also does a good job with the other Watchmen: the aloof and almost all-powerful Doctor Manhattan; the somewhat weak and indecisive Nite Owl; and the jingoistic Comedian. Perhaps the only character who doesn't quite work for me is Ozymandias; considering how important he becomes by the end of the story, I don't think he gets quite enough attention early on.<br /><br />Apart from Ozymandias, I have a few other problems with Watchmen. The Black Freighter segment seems overdone to me, and doesn't add much to my understanding of the story; and I alsodon't care much for a late plot twist that involves a silly-looking creature. But these are minor flaws. More significant is the fact that I've continued to think about the characters and politics of Watchmen, long after I finished reading it. Far from being a disposable piece of pop culture, it's a fascinating social commentary that sticks with you.<br /><br />But does that make it one of the great novels of the 20th century? I'm not sure. Perhaps I'm not the right guy to ask, since I've never been too keen on contemporary fiction. But, for what it's worth, I enjoyed Watchmen much more than I enjoyed some of my other recent reads, including: On the Road; The Brooklyn Follies; Super Sad True Love Story; and A Visit from the Goon Squad (this year's Pulitzer winner). So yeah, this is good art - very good art - and I'm glad I finally got around to reading it.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|pro: like most reviewers said, the game is exrtremelyn fun, addictve, and challenging. provides many enough levels to enjoy the fun for a long time.  con: the game sort of loses its logic as it gets more difficult, especially the last stage. sometimes u just try any possible moves and find a specific move which makes spiders make mistakes (and u just dont know why). it reduces the fun of the game and just let u spend more time with the game without purposes.  still a great game anyway.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is every bit as fun as it is on the iPad.  It had some performance issues until the most recent update.  This game is Angry Birds caliber.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was a fan of the original series when it was on MTV, so when I saw it appear on a Gold Box special, I jumped at it.  I've been watching it over the last month or so with my wife and two sons (9 and 13).  Everyone enjoys this show, from my wife and I who get the multiple levels of the humor, to my kids who of course laugh at the history teacher's eye-bulging frustration but also laugh at the sly observations and quips that Daria slips into every scene.  It makes me happy to think that it's showing  them that there's much more to humor than the prat falls and lame jokes that is all too common on the Nick and Disney channel shows they tend to watch.  If you enjoy intelligent and honest writing, you'll love this series too.  The only thing I regret about this purchase is that soon, I'll be out of episodes to watch and will return to a reality where the Jersey Shore is considered cutting edge entertainment.
B00004ZD69|5.0|I love this album.  If I had bigger, better speakers I might well be ticketed by the bylaw officer in my town.  What a wonderful band.  Brave, bold, daring, unstoppable, relentless, music to knock down national boundaries.  \\"Lift yer skinny fists ---\\" indeed.  100% recommendation.  Buy it, turn up the volume. Oh --- and I mistakenly awarded it three stars when I first submitted this rewiew --- no no, this a a FIVE-star thunderstorm, ready to rock your house.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I had the galaxy x and fell in love with it and played with it several times a day. Now I have the galaxy x 2 and the game constantly crashes. A good friend of mines also plays with this game as well with his itouch and I have noticed that he gets updates fairly often, he has a garden where he grows plants and he also has more achievements than the game that I have for android. I would really like to have the same options, beating this game 3 times and earning the same achievements is becoming boring and bothersome when you invest money on a game the same price as the one on the itouch and the have more owls than us android users which is turning out that we are the majority of your players.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Turns out this game not working on the E4GT was Samsung's fault not the devs. This was always one of my favorite games ever and it still is. Glad to have it back. I'd love some new levels/versions, but as a time waster, it's still very fun.

B0014Z4ON4|4.0|Ahhh, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom...  It's one of those you-love-it-or-you-hate-it films, even amongst Indiana Jones fans.  I know quite a few fans who think it's the best out of all four of the films.  I also know quite a few who'd like to forget it was ever made.  The film (4/5):  India.  1935.  After a near-fatal encounter with Chinese gangsters in Shanghai and a harrowing airplane escape, Indy (Harrison Ford) finds himself stranded in the heart of the Indian sub-continent.  He and his companions, resourceful pint-sized sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Qan) and whiny spoiled nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), encounter the shaman of a small village which has fallen on very hard times lately.  The shaman says that the village's children have been kidnapped, and all of the crops have failed.  He and his fellow villagers believe that these tragedies have happened because their religious artifact, a polished brown stone with three white lines carved into one side of it, was stolen and taken to Pankot Palace, home of the regional governor known as the Maharajah.  Indy believes the stone to be one of the five legendary lost Sankara Stones.  Seeing visions of personal fortune and glory, he agrees to travel to Pankot and retrieve the stone.  Once there, he and his friends quickly discover why the stone was stolen.  The Thuggee cult, worshippers of the evil goddess Kali, believe that the stone and the two others they've discovered give them immense control of the minds of other people.  Even the Maharajah is under their mind-control.  The head priest, Mola-Ram (Amrish Puri), and his trusted lieutenant (Roshan Seth) take great pleasure offering human sacrifices to Kali.  The village children they've kidnapped have been put into slavery, forced to dig and search for the remaining two Sankara Stones.  The Thuggee believe that, once all five stones are in their possession, they will be able to control the minds of everyone on Earth.  Will Indy be able to avoidbeing mind-controlled by the Thuggee?  Will he recover the stone and rescue the children?  Will Willie ever stop her damn whining???  Temple of Doom is definitely the darkest and scariest of all four Indiana Jones films.  This is not too surprising though, when you consider that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were both going through some dark and troubling times in their own personal lives while making this film.  Spielberg, one of the producers of 1983's Twilight Zone: The Movie, was being sued for wrongful death because of a terrible tragedy on the set of that film.  And Lucas was in the midst of a messy divorce and child custody battle.  This film, along with the Spielberg-produced films Poltergeist and Gremlins, were the impetus for the creation of the PG-13 rating a year later.  A stomach-churning yet oddly-hilarious dinner feast, a rescue scene featuring lots and lots and LOTS of bugs, a horrifyingly gory and prolonged human sacrifice, scenes of the slave children being repeatedly physically abused by their captors, LOTS of gratuitous violence and some not-so-subtle sexual banter between Indy and Willie are just some of the reasons why parents of children under 12 should be encouraged not to allow their children to see this film.  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is my personal favorite of all four films.  It's not the best one in the series.  Raiders of the Lost Ark is, and will always be, the best one.  Temple of Doom is my personal fave because there are many moments of wonderfully-timed comic relief to counterbalance all of the deeply darker moments in the film.  Some examples of this are:  the villagers openly gawking at Willie as she tries unsuccessfully to climb on top of an elephant, Short Round accusing Indy of cheating while they're playing poker only to have Indy discover that Short Round's been cheating throughout the whole game, and a Thuggee guard knocking one of his fellow guards unconscious by accidentally bonking the poor fellow on thehead with a heavy iron mallet.  Of course, there are many other moments of comic relief throughout the entire film.  But, those three are my personal favorites!  Having said all that, I can see why quite a few people do not like this film for those very reasons.  It probably also doesn't help that this is the only film in the series that does not reveal any part of Indy's personal history.  All-in-all, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, while not the best Indy film, is an entertaining way to spend two hours in front of your TV set.  I feel I must repeat, though, that parents should strongly consider not allowing their younger children to watch it for the reasons I stated previously.  The video quality (4/5):  It's pretty good, considering that this film is now 27 years old!  There are some minor problems.  The color quality is a bit inconsistent at times, with flesh-tones occasionally looking a bit overly pinkish.  And there is some slightly noticeable film grain in one or two scenes.  But, those are just nitpicks on my part.  On the major plus side, I didn't notice any edge enhancement or compression artifacts of any kind.  And, that's always a good thing in my opinion!  The audio quality (4/5):  The language options included on the disc are English Dolby Digital 5.1, French Dolby Digital 2.0 and Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0.  There also optional subtitles available in those three languages.  The English 5.1 track is surprisingly strong and powerful, again considering the film's vintage.  John Williams' music nicely surrounds you from all five channels, and has some punchy subwoofer bass too!  The dialogue sounds just a tad bit tinny at times, but still comes through the center channel speaker clear and understandable.  And the sound effects make full and effective use of the front and rear surround channels during the film's action scenes.  The only disappointment, sound-effects-wise, is during the film's quieter moments when the rear surround channels are silentexcept for the music.  The bonus materials (3/5):  First, it must be noted that since this is the May 2008 re-issuing of the film on DVD, a skippable trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull plays before the main menu appears.  Well, folks, there aren't a whole lot of extras to be found on this disc.  What is here, though, is somewhat entertaining and informative.  The following bonus materials are included on the disc:  An introduction by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.  \\"The Creepy Crawlies\\" featurette about the various insects, reptiles and animals seen in the first three Indiana Jones films.  This featurette includes an optional trivia subtitle track.  \\"Travel With Indy: Locations\\" featurette highlighting some of the real-world filming locations used in the first three films.  This featurette also includes an optional trivia subtitle track.  A storyboard featurette highlighting the film's mine care chase sequence.  A collection of galleries featuring on-set production photographs, promotional artwork and concept design artwork for the film's sets, costumes and props.  A trailer for the video game \\"LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures\\", as well as instructions for downloading a PC demo of the game from the game's website.  The \\"Creepy Crawlies\\" and \\"Travel With Indy\\" featurettes are the best of the bunch.  They provide a surprising amount of information and vintage behind-the-scenes footage, considering how short they both are!  The galleries were also interesting to look at, especially the one featuring concept designs for the various posters made for the film's theatrical release.  Chances are, though, that you'll view the rest of the bonus materials once, and never think of them again.  Overall (4/5):  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is action-packed and entertaining, if you don't mind the film's darker elements.  It's not the best Indy film.  But, it's still very fun to watch, if you're an adult or a teenager.  Again, I can't stress this enough, this film probably should not be watched by younger or more sensitive children.  It's likely they'll have nightmares because of it.  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is somewhat highly recommended by me, if only for it's many moments of much-needed comic relief.
B005OHSNMG|4.0|I began watching this show only because I like Ms. Deschanel, and she's a very talented actress. I think the scenes without her fall flat, though, hence the four stars, but Ms. Deschanel is the heart and soul of the show. The theme song is also quite catchy.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm a fan-girl.  R2D2 was the ring bearer at my wedding.  As a Star Wars fan of Death Star proportions, I'm tired of all the complaining.

B000VNMMWA|5.0|Hot Fuzz (directed by Edgar Wright, and starring Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward and Paul Freeman) is one of the funniest comedies I've seen in the past decade.  It's also one damn cool action flick, too!  The action scenes are not only completely amazing to watch.  They also pay perfectly loving homage to just about every buddy-cop film made within the past 30 years.  The movie itself (rating 5/5):  I'll keep the plot synopsis as short as possible:  Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Pegg) of London's Metropolitan Police force is one top cop.  He graduated from the academy at the absolute top of his class.  And, for the past few years, his arrest record has been putting everyone else to shame.  So much so, that his superiors decide to transfer him to the sleepy little village of Sandford, to save the rest of the police force from further embarrassment by comparison!  In Sandford, Angel's new boss, Inspector Frank Butterman (Broadbent), is a good-natured and likeable old fellow.  Butterman's son, Police Constable Danny Butterman (Frost), is a bit of a screw-up.  But, he's a loveable screw-up, and he always means well.  Almost immediately after Sergeant Angel arrives in town, certain high-profile citizens start meeting untimely, and sometimes-gruesome, ends.  Angel suspects that none of them were accidents, and that all of them are connected.  Unfortunately for him, almost no one in town wants to believe that a serial killer may be in their midst!  It's up to Sergeant Angel and Constable Butterman to figure out what the hell is going on, and put an end to all the mayhem.  When the movie is trying to be funny, it's VERY funny!  And, when it's trying to be action-packed and no-holds-barred violent, it's very much those things, too!  And the best part is: sometimes the movie is all three things at once!  Edgar Wright's directing is spot-on!  Even though this is only his second major feature film (Shaun of the Dead was his first), if you didn't know any better, you'd think he's been directing comedies and action films for years and years.  His directing skill is THAT good!  And the acting performances by both Pegg and Frost are also excellent.  Funny when they need to be, and surprisingly convincing and effective in all the action scenes, these two obviously have a great time together and a great love for all the action films that this one is lampooning.  And, man, Timothy Dalton sure had lots of fun in his role as the snooty owner of the local supermarket!  In fact, he has some of the funniest lines in the film.  The video quality (3.5/5):  Basically, it's good but not great.  And the weird thing is it varies from scene to scene.  Some parts of the film look spectacular, with nary a blemish to be seen.  Other scenes, like the opening shot for example, have noticeable edge-enhancement.  I also spotted some compression artifacts here and there.  Overall the video quality, while not horrible, is such a crap-shoot that it can get frustrating if you're a videophile like me.  I suspect, though, that the erratic video quality is a direct result of all the audio options available.  Something obviously had to be sacrificed in order to have enough space on the disc.  And, speaking of the audio...  The audio quality (5/5):  The film's main audio comes in three language options: English Dolby Digital 5.1-EX, French Dolby Digital 5.1-EX and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1-EX.  There are also optional subtitles in those same three languages.  Damn, this film's audio kicks all flavors and colors of a**!  The dialogue comes through the center channel crystal-clear at all times, even during the film's more action-intense moments.  And those action-intense moments will make your fronts, surrounds and subwoofer beg for mercy!  They may also make all your neighbors pound on your front door, demanding that you turn it down.  And it's not just the action scenes that make full use of all your speakers.  Even the quieter moments have great aural ambiance to them.  Also, the music comes at you from all channels, too.  All-in-all, this is one of the best surround experiences I've ever heard on standard-def DVD.  The bonus materials (5/5):  Five.  Count them: FIVE audio commentaries are included along with the main movie on the first disc of this three-disc package!  And the best thing is, they're all worth listening to at least once.  Here's how the audio commentaries break down:  Commentary 1:  The filmmakers (actor/co-writer Simon Pegg and director/co-writer Edgar Wright)  Commentary 2:  The Sandford Police (actors Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Rafe Spall, Kevin Eldon and Olivia Colman)  Commentary 3:  The Village people (actors Kenneth Cranham, Timothy Dalton, Paul Freeman and Edward Woodward)  Commentary 4:  The REAL Police (police officers Andy Leafe and Nick Eckland)  Commentary 5:  The celebrity commentary (director/co-writer Edgar Wright and his new best friend and fellow director Quentin Tarantino!)  In addition to the commentaries on the first disc, there's also the Fuzz-O-Meter optional trivia subtitle track, which I found to be both entertaining and informative.  The other extras included in this set include an extended version of The Fuzz-Ball Rally documentary (it's quite a few minutes longer than the version found on the single-disc release of Hot Fuzz) which includes it's own optional audio commentary, \\"Dead Right\\" which was one of director Edgar Wright's earliest filmmaking efforts (he shot it on VHS when he was a teenager) and his very first cop film (it features TWO audio commentaries: one with Edgar Wright, and the other with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost making comments and jokes about the film AND about Wright's commentary!), 22 deleted scenes, lots of video blogs, eight other featurettes focusing on various different aspects of the making of the film, outtakes, a special effects before-and-after comparison, \\"Hot Funk\\" which hilariously demonstrates how some of the more profanity-laden scenes have been cleaned up for the eventual network television broadcasts of Hot Fuzz, plot-holes and comparisons, storyboards and a few other cool little goodies.  Overall rating (4.5/5 for the entire three disc set):  Hot Fuzz is a very satisfying film to watch.  The comedy is very funny, and the action scenes are some of the best ever put to celluloid!  If you're a fan of Hot Fuzz, you should already own this three-disc set.  And, if you're a fan of the film, but you don't own this set...what the hell is wrong with you???  Even if you've never seen Hot Fuzz, but you love comedies or you love being blown out of your seat by intense, white-knuckled action scenes, you should still own this set.  You'll be in for a real treat!  The film alone is worth the purchase price, but the excellent bonus materials definitely sweeten the deal!  To sum things up:  this Three-Disc Collector's Edition of Hot Fuzz is worth owning, in spite of the sometimes-questionable video quality, and comes highly recommended!
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Note: I saw this movie not less than 20 minutes ago with XFinity OnDemand.<br /><br />This film is nothing short of brilliant. Captivating from the opening shot until the end credits fade out, Darren Aronofsky's latest movie is a masterpiece, and may serve to boost interest in Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, if not only for the beautiful music, than to see it performed live. Ms. Portman gives an electrifying performance. You feel as if you are drawn in, resisting the impulse to draw back because you find yourself wanting more...and you know you do. Ms. Portman is sheer perfection here. I highly recommend this movie based on Ms. Portman's performance. See this film, you will not regret it. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.
