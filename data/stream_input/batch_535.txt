B000002U8G|4.0|...but having drowned myself throughout life with alternative, punk, ska, jazz, big band, etc. I have begun digging back into classic rock.  <br /> <br />One day I was listening to Music Choice on cable and the song \\"Fearless\\" came on. I recall hearing the song back in high school and most likely dismissed it as \\"hippie crap.\\" I enjoyed the flow of the tune and downloaded the album.  <br /> <br />I listened to the album closely and instantly dug it. A couple of the later tracks made me realize how one of my favorite artists, Beck, must really like this album. I am not saying Beck Hanson ripped them off but some of the songs sound awfully similar to a few of Beck's numbers (see his album \\"Mutations\\"). If you like this album I would highly suggest you picking up Beck's \\"Mutations\\" -- a great album. <br /> <br />I would suggest this album to any fan of music.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is quite a wonderful film! Porco Rosso is a stunning masterpiece. From a visual point of view, it is full of beautiful scenery, partially due to where the story takes place. It is the story of a World War I pilot who is somehow transformed into the Crimson Pig. We watch as he battles evil, faces his own demons, and lives an isolated existence with his trusty flying boat. There is a nice surprise in the end, though at the risk of spoiling it for you, I will not divulge it.  <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the period, of flying boats, of the setting, of brave airmen, of flying pigs (quite literally!), of Miyazaki, well, I think you will love this. Porco Rosso is fantastic!
0449227545|4.0|The thing about Ken Follett's books is you can pick one up without knowing what it's about and be certain you'll enjoy the experience. This was the only book of his that I've put off reading, because the plot didn't seem that appealing to me.<br /><br />Once again, however, Follett came through with flying colors. Whatever this book lacks in story it makes up for with characters.<br /><br />Simply put, no one fleshes out characters like Ken Follett. Invariably, I always feel like his characters are real people whom I have gotten to know intimately.<br /><br />Don't miss this one (and try not to fall in love with Melanie...)
B000B0QOJA|4.0|Let's be clear about the music on these two cds : it's great music, both compelling and stunning. One Down One Up is the most exciting piece. But some other pieces are shunted (Afro Blue), interrumpted by radio presentation (My Favorite Things on its coda....). So an album for musicians and completists only. I should advise the wonderful Live at Birdland and The complete Village Vanguard sessions... Save your money or borrow it at your library or to a friend of yours.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Reign In Blood was my first Slayer album. Great songs (angel of death, raining blood...), high technic level, good production...and it is so fast ! It has furiously kicked my @ss and it still does. From the beginning to the end, it is 29 minutes of fury and instinct. No time to breathe ! <br />This everlasting album is one of Slayer's best (with Hell Awaits and God Hates Us All) and a masterpiece of thrash-metal. If you got Metallica's Master Of Puppets and think it is a reference, let me tell you that it sucks ! Just burn it and buy Reign In Blood. But beware of the addiction...   <br /> <br />
B0000025T6|5.0|Wow! This album gives me goose bumps every time i listen to it. A timeless classic straight up.
B000A5DV42|5.0|The worthy follow-up to Supergrass' eponymous 1999 masterpiece took five years but finally arrived in the form of \\"Road to Rouen.\\"     Though it featured the wonderfully bouncy single \\"Grace,\\" there was something rather labored and unexciting about 2002's \\"Life On Other Planets.\\" I wasn't worried. It just seemed like the inevitable letdown after a classic, and I was confident they'd be alright. \\"Rouen\\" shows they're just fine.     The boys chose to record this one in France, and the atmosphere seems to have filtered into the music. There were hints of this sound on \\"Supergrass,\\" but the band has wandered further away from the simple head-bobbing of their \\"Alright\\" days and into the more expressive tones of adult soul-searching. \\"Tales of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6)\\" is a perfect starter, setting the mood and showing a willingness to experiment. The somber \\"St. Petersburg\\" would not have been my choice as a lead-off single; I would've leaned toward \\"Kick In the Teeth\\" or a mixed-down version of \\"Roxy\\" for that. However, it sparkles in the second half with a keyboard reminiscent of David Holmes' \\"Rodney Yates.\\" The title track and \\"Low C\\" show that the fellas have not lost their knack for a chorus, but the real treat is the closer, \\"Fin.\\" This is as close to a ballad as Supergrass has ever come. Maybe `lullaby' is a better word. Either way, it's totally unexpected and quite lovely.     This is one of the few bands to come along in the last decade whose new releases I get excited about. I'm glad to see that I have good reason to keep getting excited.
B000AARKO4|5.0|Kingdom of heaven comes from Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator and Blackhawk Down. The movie is a historic epic of the highest caliber filled with a fantastic score, breath-taking visuals, great acting, and a beautiful and very relevant story-line.   <br /> <br />The film covers the fall of the Latin crusader kingdom of Jerusalem to the Saracens. The capture of Jerusalem by the legendary Muslim general Salah ad-Din; better known to the west as \\"Saladin\\". The backdrop of this tumultuous time in history serves well to produce a dramatic and passionate look at events that still affect us to this day. We are treated to fabulous recreations of the holy city as well as some of the biggest scenes (battles and otherwise) I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br />At its heart though, Kingdom of Heaven is a small personal story within the context of huge events. It is a very human tale, as Balian(Orlando Bloom), a young blacksmith  who recently lost his wife struggles to find meaning, redemption, and a new beginning. His faith shattered, he decides to go to the holy land with his newfound father who shows up unexpectedly. In Jerusalem this one-time blacksmith finds the \\"kingdom of heaven\\" to be within himself in his own deeds and choices and plays a crucial role in events so much larger than himself.  <br /> <br />Balian serves the King of Jerusalem, a wise and tolerant man who knows that peace with Saladin is not only practical (as they are outnumbered) but also his moral duty. The king struggles to control fanatics like the Knights Templar lead by Guy De Leon, a man hungry for glory, power, and riches; as well as renegades like the mad Raynold, who is bloodthirsty and genocidal. The movie depicts the sad truth of historical fact, such as catholic priests preaching that \\"to kill an infidel (Muslim) is not murder, it is the path to heaven\\".  <br /> <br />Saladin, a wise and enlightened ruler has united the Arabs into a single force through his political and military prowess. Saladin himself is a quite tolerant man, and both him and the King of Jerusalem maintain an uneasy peace while religious zealots on both side cry out for blood. With the King's death, crusader renegades succeed in provoking war by attacking a Muslim caravan and killing Saladin's own sister (historically factual). Saladin marches his vast army against the outnumbered and surrounded Christians, who arrogantly and blindly march out to meet him and are annihilated. Balian now is left to defend Jerusalem against an army bent on revenge not just for this recent insult but for the slaughter of Jerusalem's Muslims by the army of the first crusade. Balian's only hope is to defend the city so fervently that magnanimous Saladin might be forced to terms, whereby he can negotiate for clemency.  <br /> <br />I think they struck the balance between history and Hollywood perfect. The story is by and large, historically accurate. While some characters such as Balian, were fictionalized in trivial ways to fit with the storyline, the larger events as well as the atmosphere itself is wonderfully portrayed. The movie over-all tells a much greater truth, exploring the role of religion and symbolism in human conflict, the constant struggle between tolerance and intolerance, and how each of us can make a difference within all of it in our own choices and attitudes. <br /> <br />The special effects are top notch and the cinematography is absolutely excellent. Kingdom of heaven has some of the finest camera work of any movie, and adds to the terrific script and intelligent dialogue. Every dimension of this movie, from the source material, to the script, to the wardrobe and sets, to the special effects and score, to the acting is draped in excellence befitting such a complex tale. Some might not \\"get\\" this movie because there are no real \\"good guys\\". No one side is in the right, rather the forces of tolerance are at odds with fanaticism, and when the fanatics win out, it is up to good menof honor to try and protect the innocent bystanders in the wake of a war in which each side felt it was doing the will of God. But within that larger story is the story of one simple man, who on a pilgrimage to absolve his sins finds answers to questions about life and managed to do great things and find for himself a new beginning through helping the defenseless and seeing the world through clearer eyes. And at the end, even though the cycle of violence and tragedy to be only just beginning (and still is today), he is able to start his life anew, and presumably is able to live his life in peace with the knowledge that the kingdom of heaven is within us all. To any that love huge, passionate, explorative films that respect the complexities of the real world instead of giving in to the Hollywood urge to tell only one side of a story, give this movie a look! And to anyone looking for a wonderfully-crafted modern epic filled with action, intelligence, and a meaningful commentary on the motivations that drive men to fight, then this movie is also for you. <br /> <br />The DVD includes excellent features, including production notes, interviews, making of material, a trailer, and most importantly TWO documentaries pertaining to the historical accuracy of the film (History vs. Hollywood, and A&E Movie Real) which compliment the movie terrifically. In these times we now live, we more than ever need to look back to this period in order to better understand the continuation of conflict that persists not only in Jerusalem, but between western and Islamic culture in general. There is also a very nice feature that pops up information bubbles during the movie pointing out production decisions relevant to, and/or historical gripes and points about, that particular scene.  <br />

630521610X|5.0|As you can read from the title this is one of the best teenage slasher flicks movies that was made in the mid 90's that I have ever seen. I wouldn't describe it as your typical horror movie. The movie is just so good that I will try to keep my review brief to not give to much away.  Directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson; this film pays homage  to the classic 1978 horror flick Halloween and spoofs other horror movies and horror situations.    The movie starts off pretty quickly with Casey Beckert played by Drew Barrymore picking up the phone and starting a casual conversation with a stranger on the other line about movies. She is ready to watch a scary movie.  The caller get's personal with her and soon starts to torment Drew's character and says she will have to correctly answer his movie questions or her and her boyfriend Steve will die.  The beginning of the movie is just so intense its actually my favorite part. The music gets more dreadful and its a perfect way to keep the audience more interested as to what is coming up.    We then move to Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell who has had intamacy issues since her mother passed away almost a year ago.  Billy Loomis played by Skeet Ulrich plays the somewhat patient boyfriend who tries to get Sydney to forgot about her mothers death and to move on.  We soon learn that there has been 2 students killed who went to Woodsborough High. The teens were gutted from the inside out. The rest of the cast is introduced here. Courtney Cox plays the annoying tabloid reporter Gale Wethers who will do anything to get a story expecially this one. She wrote a book on Sydney's mothers death and made it into a best seller and Sydney now has a grudge against her. David Arquette plays Deputy Dewey Riley the nerdy cop in charge of looking into what has happened and is helping in the investigation.  Matthew Lilliard plays Stu who is Tatum's boyfriend and  Tatum is played by Rose McGowan. They are all interviewed as tohow well they knew the victims. The killer soon starts to stalk Sydney by calling her at her home and finding her at her school among other places. She ends up staying at Tatums for her safety. Suspicions start to mount as to who the killer is and what kind of motive the killer or suspect may have. There are some very funny moments and memorable lines with Jamie Kennedy who plays Randy, the nerdy movie freek who works at a video store. The humor makes the movie more interesing to watch.  The killer continues killing more victims in pretty grotesque ways. The first 2 killings is probably the goriest. The students all end up going to a party at Stus house after the high school closes down due to another attempted murder.  After everyone leaves the party only a few people are left behind and this is where most of the action beginns. The special effects are very interesting too near the end. You will enjoy this film I guarantee that. I watched it 4 times when it came out in 1996. The ending is great and it will blow you away. The collectors edition includes 7 minutes of behind the scenes. These include the high school scene with Neve, Skeet, Rose, Randy and Matthew, scenes with Neve and Courtney outside of a police station, the beginning with Drew Barrymore, and near the end with Neve Campbell.  There is an interesting interview with the director Wes Craven. There are also cameos in the movie by Linda Blair ( The Excorcist) and Henry Winkler (The Fonz).
0689859414|5.0|I could not be more impressed with the art and the presentation of this book. Just about every trick was used to make this book stand out far, far above the rest of its kind. Unlike Brian Froud, Tony keeps the subject matter lighter hearted and clear of images that are not appropriate for younger readers. This book is very suitable for children and should be adored and used as a reference by illustrators for years to come. As an illustrator, I am tremendously inspired by Tony's artwork and creativity in this book. some of the illustrations are just about as good as it comes.  <br />a fantastic work in its entirety!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|FOR A NOT SO FAMOUS SHOW THE PRODUCTION VALUE IS GREAT. ENDED BEFORE ITS TIME.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul is back with a spectacular album. If it was not for the obsession that Paul seems to have developped to look and act as if he was still twenty (you know, jumping on the pictures as if he was still a young kid shooting for Hard Day's Night or dying his hair), the album would be perfect. I have been for a long time a bit embarrassed with Paul work and appearance/behaviour lately - you know when he forces himself (and his band) to simulates monkeys during the tour of Back in the US for instance. I could not understand why he had to act like if he was a teenager. However, with this album (music, AOL sessions, interviews), Paul appears more relax, accepting his age, the death of Linda and this is much more effective that imitating a chimpanze to look cool. <br /> <br />According to me, his voice has aged but he sings in a calm and serious tone that makes all songs sound very elegant and very professional. It is very moving to find him serious and trying to write good songs (probably as he was when he was competing against john in writing songs). He is not playing monkey business in this album (high-pitch shouts like the end of Hey Jude that i do not particularly like for instance).  <br /> <br />\\"A Certain Softness\\" is a splendid ballad, perfectly sung, that reminds me of \\"and I Love her\\". Beautiful guitar, percussion, background vocals and very clean sound. <br /> <br />\\"English Tea\\" is so beatles-like. It is nice to see Paul accepting the past and accepting to write songs like Maxwell Silver Hammer without being ashamed. I could not help but think that Paul has been convinced for years that he was condemned to write everything as long as it did not sound 'beatles'. But he was a beatle and you can't ignore the past too long. <br /> <br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" is very nice but i don't like the fact that the guitar is following the melody a bit too much. Nice flute solo. A song to listen with melancoly. <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" is a very mature song. Nice melody, pretty bass line. You end up singing the song in your head for a long time after it has stopped playing. <br /> <br />The other songs are pretty nice too. Melodies and interpretation. The voice of Paul is so unique. He has a tone that is so warm and smooth.  <br /> <br />I am not sure i like \\"Fine Line\\". Some other reviewers compare it with \\"Lady Madonna\\" but i am not sure why. I particularly don't like the piano which i find is played very monotoneously and without 'finesse'. <br /> <br />Overall, and according to me, this album is, by far, the best he produced since 1970. I can't stop listening to it in loop since 15 days. Hopefully, Paul will remain focused and produce a lot more of this excellent type of work. <br /> <br />I think that Paul in 1960 had a lot of facility to create songs. He did not understand himself how he was doing it. He was young, enthusiastic and everything had to be done in these years. However, the inspiration source run slightly out of water and it took him a lot of years at the end of the Beatles to realize that he could not write songs so lightly anymore. If he had a bit less spontaneous ideas, he could compensate it with some more serious work. I believe that the new album is a perfect embodiment of this. <br /> <br />Beautiful.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I liked to say that the movie really came back after a decade of the game's ending, for those who were devasted over Aerith's death and wondering if anyone survived during the meteor attack from Sephiroth's summoning of destroying every last human on the earth. Truth is, yes. The movies takes place two years after the meteor attack, everything lies in ruins and the virus called \\"Geostigma\\" that is endangering other people. After watching a few trailers and teasers, the two characters who have generated the most excitement by showing up are Aerith and Sephiroth. Cloud, the fake-turned-hero, won't be alone to handle the fight. Everyone of the character's from FFVII have made appearences in trailers, including Cid, Yuffie, Barret, and Red XIII. Then there's Vincent who who seems to have an important role, showing up in most of the trailers talking to Cloud about \\"Geostigma\\" and the danger the children are in.  <br /> <br />Fans who are familiar with the original FFVII's theme \\"life\\" will have this AC called \\"relief\\" or \\"rescue\\". Nomura really did a good job of breathing life into the 2-D pixelated game into a 3-D reality and designing the characters. (If you don't know who Nomura is, he's one of the game's most important creators). If you think this is a disappointment don't be so sure. Just be glad they extend the movie to 95 minutes long instead of 45 minutes. If you're a die-hard FFVII fan or not or isn't familiar with this will enjoy the full \\"psyhique\\" of the games visuals.
B00006AUIG|2.0|I like the horror genre as much as the next twisted individual. I enjoy being scared out of my chair, covering my eyes during certain graphic moments, sitting glued to my seat as some character you've become emotionally vested in opens a door you know should NEVER be opened. But this film delivered on none of those.<br /><br />First, let's start with the films basic outline: a group of Hazmat workers have contracted to clean up the abandoned Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusetts. It's a creepy looking monstrosity-of-a-building which seems to develop as a sort of character all on its own. And as the workers delve into the building's rooms, they find little odds and ends that attract each worker: one finding coins and rings; another finding interview tapes (9 of them) from a patient with multiple personality disorder; and still another worker finds ...insanity and death.<br /><br />Where this film fell down was in plot. It didn't seem to have one or --- probably more likely --- was buried so deep in the film's nuances that you'd be hard-pressed to find it with a microscope. Now I'm not asking for everything to be spelled out in black and white for me (in fact, I HATE that), but film makers also need to be conscious of not losing their audience completely.<br /><br />Let me explain. If the makers of this movie wanted me to understand the motivation of the terrible things that happened in this place and their effects on the Hazmat team, they utterly flopped at doing so. I have no idea why one of the team members began killing everyone around him. Or what influence the building had on him. Or if he was somehow connected with the hospital at some point in his life. Or what \\"the lobotomy chair\\" had to do with any of it.<br /><br />There's a reason this film hasn't sold well and is not available at most video rental stores. It'll only appeal to those who absolutely love disassociated threads in a movie's message. But that's certainly not for me. I need at least one thread to hang on to.one thread to hang on to.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Thanks, sorry for those of you who hate Death Cab, I'm another one of those people who gives Death Cab five stars. I'm usually not one to have a favorite band; mostly I only like two or three songs of one particular band and move on. But after I listened to \\"I will Follow you into the dark\\", over a few months, I collected all of their CDs, and became an instant fan. Death Cab is an escape from the crap that people are playing on the radio these days, and I'm glad they're there so that I at least have something to turn to when I'm tired of the the cliche's played on the modern media. Would highly recommend anyone to at least try their CD's out once, because they could definitely be your next favorite.
B00005TT77|4.0|I will admit that I come close to holding Beatles' songs sacrosanct.  However, I also appreciate an artist who brings something new to the table in terms of interpretation.  I have also discovered that it takes more than one listening to appreciate what an artist has done either for a song or to a song.  In either case, there are some very good interpretations of Beatle's music on this CD in addition to some that, while perhaps not travesties, make me queasy.<br /><br />I did not recognize \\"Two of Us,\\" a nicely executed rendition by Aimee Mann and Michael Penn.  This song is simply performed with little embellishment and the folk interpretation seems appropriate to this Lennon/McCartney tune.  Similarly, Sarah McLachlan brings a nice touch to \\"Blackbird,\\" remaining faithful to the Lennon/McCartney original.<br /><br />I am less impressed with Rufus Wainwright's interpretation of \\"Across the Universe.\\"  Some songs require careful interpretation and John Lennon's lead vocal is the standard for this song.  Sorry, but Rufus Wainwright just does not measure up.  Similarly, Paul had \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" nailed on \\"Rubber Soul,\\" and the Wallflowers' version sounds like the Monkees with deeper voices.<br /><br />Eddie Vedder does breathe a different life into \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,\\" from \\"Help!\\"  The musical interpretation remains to the original, including a lovely harmonica inserted into the bridge.  Vedder's growling voice is close enough to the original with enough difference to make this song interesting and fun.  I also enjoyed Ben Harper's version of \\"Strawberry Fields.\\"  However, I also thought the version in the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" movie was nicely done, so you may want to consider my bias.<br /><br />We go from a selection of nicely done songs to yet another that just does not do it for me.  The only version of \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" that I have enjoyed, other than Paul McCartney singing the Lennon/McCartney original, is the version done by John Denver.  If you like Cheryl Crow maybe this will be your song, but if you are a big fan of the Beatles this track is one to skip.<br /><br />When Ben Folds begins singing \\"Golden Slumbers\\" I first thought it was the original.  Ben sounds so much like Paul as this song starts.  More than a copy, this song was nicely done.  \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" yet another song that had John Lennon at the helm in \\"Revolver,\\" is very nicely performed by the Vines.  The style is modern and yet has so many elements from the 60s that there are moments where I was disoriented as I tried to separate the old and new elements.<br /><br />I am unsure of how I feel about the Stereophonics' interpretation of \\"Don't Let Me Down.\\"  John Lennon's vocals on the original were excellent, and this song has always been one of my favorites from the Beatles.  The lead vocal on this version is very different, and even after trying to appreciate the difference it makes from the original, I still struggle coming to grips with how different the vocals are.<br /><br />I am always concerned when someone tries to do a cover of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\"  The original with John Lennon doing the lead vocal honors is the standard, but the Elton John version was excellently done and I enjoy it as much as the original.  The version here by the Black Crowes is also nicely done, and while I think it falls a bit short of Elton John's version, it is a worthy interpretation and a nice addition to this album.  However, I could have done without the embellished ending.<br /><br />Chocolate Genius's interpretation of \\"Julia\\": I think the interpretation was in another language, one I do not care for.  While Heather Nova's rendition of \\"We Can Work It Out\\" remains true to the original, her breathless vocals leave me a little cold.  Bring back Paul's vocals for this one.<br /><br />Howie Day's version of \\"Help!\\" is very interesting.  While the vocal style is very different from the original, as is the pacing, Day has created very interesting version that is even more desperate than the original.  However, it does take a bit to get accustomed to this version.  Another interesting cover is Paul Westerberg's version of \\"Nowhere Man.\\"  Think Bob Dylan singing a Lennon/McCartney tune.<br /><br />As for Grandaddy's version of \\"Revolution,\\" I am not pleased to say that this track can be skipped and you will then not want to break this CD.  Perhaps fine for a soundtrack (well, maybe not, but it did not sound quite this bad in the movie).<br /><br />The final song is another of those that I have mixed feelings about.  I love Paul's vocals in the original, which is one of the Beatles' most poignant songs.  Nick Cave certainly does bring a different dimension to \\"Let It Be,\\" but I keep thinking of Paul's vocals, which I think I will always prefer.<br /><br />There are many who struggle to understand the power and influence of the Beatles in their own era as well as today, but this album reminds us that for now their music has become timeless and the music of all generations.  Not all these songs work, and several border on being atrocious, but when the songs do work, it makes me long to get out my Beatles collection and spin them all again.ay has created very interesting version that is even more desperate than the original.

0452283760|5.0|I see a compliment to the power of Ayn Rand's FOUNTAINHEAD, in this fact:<br /><br />I was able to vote \\"Yes\\" on most of the reviews I read on this novel, including the ones I disagreed with or which, from my perspective, misinterpreted some of the content of the book. What impressed me to click the positive vote was that each of the reviews showed interesting contemplation communicated well (including the ones with only one or two sentences), and intriguing ways of looking at the plot, characters, and thematic framework of this novel.<br /><br />Savor the extra shot of admirable mental exercise exhibited in reviews on this novel.  Maybe there's a reason that the words \\"savor\\" and \\"savory\\" are so similar.<br /><br />This book is so pregnant with cranium stimulations it's easy to forget it's foremost a novel; Prozac and the sideline collection of wannabe Seratonin Uptake Inhibitors would be put out of business if people read a chapter or so of this type of material daily.<br /><br />(Of course, the Prozac-type high wouldn't come as easily as the the simple swallow of a pill.  It takes time to work into the type of steady self-worth which gives a true high on the potential of life.)<br /><br />I've read both FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED three times each, and will probably reread them periodically over the remaining course of my life. I've written my review of ATLAS; now I'd like to focus on what I valued most in reading FOUNTAINHEAD.<br /><br />I loved the character, Howard Roark.<br /><br />I identified with that character more than any other I've met in a work of fiction, more than any nonfiction person I've known about who has lived and been memorialized.  I admired and was renewed by his repeated choices to be true to himself, his talent, his creativity, and his needs and desires on his life path.<br /><br />I enjoyed the way Rand wrote Roark's attraction to Dominique, and could understand the source of that attraction, even when she was pretending to be a spoiled, superficial, self-destructive fool.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not a \\"typical\\" TV viewer.  In fact, I usually don't even remember when a show is on, let alone follow it regularly.  However, when I stumbled upon the TV series \\"Firefly\\" I was enthralled by the blend of sci fi, western and intelligent story lines, and began watching the show avidly.  To my dismay, the show was cancelled 5 episodes later.  Since purchasing the DVD set and watching the series in its entirety, I have concluded it is one of the most original, witty and intelligent shows produced.  Many reviews will detail plots, characters, etc., so I will not try to copy what has already been said.  What I will say is that every character is well written, well played and someone who will remain in your mind long after you have finished watching the show.  There is not a bad episode in the bunch.  What a pity it was cancelled before people had a chance to see what was being offered.  Buy the set - you won't be disappointed!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|The genius of this film lies in the incredibe writing and cast of wonderful Coenesque characters. The speed and mood of the film is set up in the first drawled ramblings of the wonderful Sam Elliot as The Stranger: <br /> <br />\\"A way out west there was a fellafella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself.  This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.  Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from.  But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  And a lot about where he lived, like- wise.  But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'.They call Los Angeles the City of Angels.  I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there.  'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says.  But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold--wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties--just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles...and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that--quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide--but sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes there's a man\\" <br /> <br />Genius <br />
B0000942QL|4.0|I was so looking forward to the re-issue of this disc, especially when I heard that Frankie's videos would be included. After listening and watching these 2 discs I was 99% satisfied. The only 2 criticisms I have for this disc, and the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, are that the songs \\"The Last Voice\\" and \\"Happy Hi\\" are NOT included and that the stuttering Nixon footage was taken out of the the \\"Two Tribes\\" video. Other than that, everything about this disc is absolutely brilliant and you can get a more in depth opinion in my other reviews of the 2 different versions of \\"Welcome To The Pleasuredome\\" that are out there in the Amazon selection.

Paramount is releasing it here. They originally announced a 2 disc set AND a 4 disc set, just like Fox did, then they changed their mind and decide to cut out the option, drop the 4th disc but charge the same. Well, they aren't getting my $$$, I am region-free and I'm buying the FOX UK version. <br />  Speaking of which, IF you do pick up a release from another region, be sure to call Paramount and TELL them why.

0738206679|5.0|\\"Linked\\" reveals fascinating similarities in characteristics between such disparate phenomena as our social network, fads & trends, our body's cells, the economy, and the Internet. For example, the success of viruses--both computer and biological--depends upon certain previously unidentified traits and thresholds. These qualities are more about the \\"network\\" of which they are part, than any \\"owned\\" property of the virus. This means that most of what we thought we knew about the spread of anything (disease, fads, ideas, social connections) before 1999 is basically flawed! While science has attempted to understand how the world works by taking things apart to understand the building blocks (reductionism), we now must learn how elements (or nodes) richly interrelate to the other parts. Researchers have discovered sets of observable, quantifiable rules of operation of these types of \\"scale-free\\" networks, as they're called. All branches of the scientific community are affected, and this perspective is being called revolutionary--literally, a \\"new science.\\" I do not believe this to be hyperbole.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis is one of the greatest musicians of the 20th century.  More than once he put out a record that changed the course of popular music.  This is one of those, and it is probably the consensus best jazz record ever.  (Looking for a number two?  You could do worse than to pick Coltrane's Blue Trane.)<br /><br />If you aren't a jazz fan (and if you are, you probably already own this), Kind of Blue is what you want jazz to sound like.  Smooth, cool, smoky, beguiling, hep, blue.  You have Miles AND Coltrane on this, and the music is unlike typical melodic pop or jazz, but unaccountably accessible.  I have never heard of a case where someone did not like this record.<br /><br />If you like jazz, then much of what followed was shaped by this record.  If you like rock, same thing; artists as surprising as Jefferson Airplane and the Allman Brothers have cited Miles Davis as an influence; indeed the liner notes here make note of Duane Allman's fondness for this particular record.<br /><br />A record that belongs in everyone's music collection, no matter what your tastes.
B000002UAR|5.0|There's not a lot left to be said about this album that hasn't been said all before, by people a lot better than me. <br /> <br />All the same, there's a few minor points to be made: <br /> <br />This is probably the last Beatles album to show a cohesive contributive process between all three songwriting Beatles, John, Paul, and George.  Later projects seem more or less entirely dominated by John or Paul, all too often seemingly in an attempt to marginalize George Harrison's contributions. <br /> <br />For John, this album features some of the last songs in a long songwriting string that featured sort of depressive, introspective content that started before the \\"Help!\\" album.  John's songs on this one waver less on themes of death and betrayal and more towards, basically, drug themes.  John's songs are generally more subtle and pad out the album, with the exceptions of the obvious classic \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" a really unique fusion of ethnic sound, experimental production and acute pop writing that in a lot of ways hasn't been equaled. <br /> <br />Paul's songwriting gets noticeably more tight on this album.  Even seemingly vapid love songs like \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" or \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" have a strange, dark vitality about them, and with the exception of the gets-old-quickly \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is probably his strongest songwriting output in the tenure of the Beatles. <br /> <br />George puts out three excellent tracks on this reasonably short album.  \\"Taxman\\" is an obvious pop standard, \\"I Want to Tell You\\" an excellent but more subtle piece that feels a lot more like his later solo work, and the charming but esoteric \\"Love You To,\\" his first strong nod to traditional Indian music (which took him two more tracks--\\"Within You Without You\\" and \\"The Inner Light\\" to fully get out of his system). <br /> <br />Also, unlike most hardcore Beatles fans, I'm kind of fond of the American cut of this album which excised John's \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" and \\"Dr. Robert.\\"  They're not bad tracks, but the album feels tighter at the remaining eleven tracks.  If you have a programmable CD player, try it.  It's worth a shot.
B00005MP58|5.0|I loved this story from the beginning to the end.  Each scene was a polished jewel of dialogue, scenery, and melody.  How pleasant to enter a world that values character, refinement,and family cohesion.  The length of the production allows the development of depth of character which is missing in so many movies.  The actors, scenery, and costumes are so well chosen that I became swept away into another time and place. I relaxed in the professionalism of the production, suspended disbelief, and gave myself over to pure enjoyment.  It has replaced \\"Gone With The Wind\\" as my favorite viewing experience.
B0007KTAU4|4.0|But i keep eating and eating and eating and eating this cd, i cant stop!!!!!!, what else can i say? that Miss Bruni filled a hole in music that was empty?, that opened new paths for pop or songwritting? or that she have provided innovation in rithms or recording process or even created a unique style? i cant say anything like that about this album, this was made to enjoy and supply sunshine to many of the days of your life, dont get so judgemental because shes a model, buy it, play it and smile   <br />HM
B0001ZMBV0|5.0|Giulini is always among my favorite conductors and this set includes some of his great recordings with CSO(1969-1976,studio,stereo) that you can not find their another editions: Beethoven 7 and Bruckner 9 ( + Mahler 1, Brahms 4, Berlioz-Romeo&Juliet, Stravinsky-Petroushka&Firebird Suites.)   CSO on its top form under the baton of Giulini...Very well recorded sounds by EMI...Wonderfull edition(not cardboard!)...Incredible price for 4 CD... Highly,highly,highly recommended...
B00005MP58|5.0|I first saw this excellent series on DVD while residing overseas.  As an ex-pat Englishman, the scenery, the architecture, the interiors and the conversations made me positively ache with nostalgia.  It is an outstanding production in every way.  I regarded it as probably the finest televised drama series I that had ever seen.  Now that I have my own edition of P&P it gets a regular showing in our household, and we just simply never tire of it.
B00005JNTX|3.0|He is a brillant perhaps great director but a little of him goes a long way. One of the extras on the dvd is an interview with him. As usual, he can't string two sentences together. He is irritating & boring. But this is not his movie. I am not as  familiar with Robert Rodriquez's style as Q.T.'s. The three loosely conected plot lines coming together is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction. Sin City was lifted frame by frame directly from the comic book & this is apparent but not really a bad thing. It is a bit different & limiting. The style does lessen the impact of the appalling violence, torture & general mayhem. In this setting it is not gratuitous. It is almost amusing, so gross that it stops being objectionable. Then you watch closely for the next atrocity. That compulsion makes it a good movie. There is little overt sexual activity but lots of sexy, half  dressed women, mostly hookers & strippers. Pre-emptively, Jessica Albas, who has a rather big part stated: \\"I don't take off my clothes\\", thereby furthering her good girl but very very hot image. Carla Gugina play Lucille the parole officer & was excellent in a small part. I hope we see more of her in the future. Mickey Rourke as Marv is easily the most compelling character in the movie. <br />   This movie is not to everyone's taste. But it is a rising genre I'd call \\"nouveau comic book noir\\".
B000002H2H|5.0|This is quite simply,one of the greatest works of music in the world!Slightly underrated,this album packs all the punch Metallica is capable of punching.It pretty much knocked me out. <br /> <br />Fight Fire With Fire:Nice intro but Metallica did produce several better thrash songs.Not one of my faves. <br /> <br />Ride The Lightning:Superb allround song with a brilliant middle section and a mind blowing solo.Yoy need to check out a video[live]to truly appreciate the skill required. <br /> <br />For Whom The Bell Tolls:One of the most famous Metallica songs ever,it deserves all the praise it gets and more too!Awesome first two minutes and an absolute concert favourite. <br /> <br />Fade To Black:My favourite Metallica song for the intro,the lyrics and the amazing outro and solo.You could argue that the intro Kirk's part is performed with a little less emotion than he does it live nowadays but I can't bear any other criticism about this song. <br /> <br />Trapped Under Ice:Good allround song but not even close to their best <br /> <br />Escape:Fans have been crying out to see it live since it has a very catchy tune and beat.It's probably an indiacation to what this band would do ten years on. <br /> <br />Creeping Death:Unbelievable song with power,speed and every thing else I want from a Metalica song <br /> <br />The Call Of Ktulu:Very good instrumental to showcase the band-members'individual skills but I prefer Orion[MOP]. <br /> <br />Overall Kirk absolutely rocks,James is at his best,I can't hear much of Cliff and Lars is nicely understated.Get this album if you want to improve your life!
1591396190|3.0|Blue Ocean Strategy is a good follow-up to Christensen's \\"The Innovator's Solution\\".  Kim and Mauborgne pick up where Christensen leaves off in terms of how to \\"compete with non-competion\\".  Their \\"strategy canvas\\" and \\"four actions framework\\" clarify many of the past business success stories we read about in business books.  The book truely does offer a framework for those who are trying to create growth in highly competitive situations.  I would recommend the book for those who spend time working on business growth. <br /> <br />The problem I have with the book is three-fold.  First, all the meat is in the second chapter - \\"Analytical Tools and Frameworks\\".  The rest of the book could be summarized as look broader, think big, don't do things out of order, and don't forget how hard it will be to implement change.  All this is dressed up with a little too much consultant-speak for my taste (i.e. price corridors and the BOI index)  <br /> <br />Secondly, the examples are not as well researched as I would expect.  For instance, the [yellow tail] example is a great story, but the authors failed to mention that one of the key elements of the success of that Australian wine was that Casella Wines included a WJ Deutsch, a huge wine exporter, in the innovation (and profits) by setting up a 50/50 joint venture.  Another example of missing key facts in a story is the NYPD Police Commisioner Bratton example in chapter #7.  That story, laid out in less detail in Gladwell's \\"The Tipping Point\\", was later brought into question in \\"Freakonomics\\".  Levitt and Dubner make a strong case that data show that the decrease in crime in the 90's in NYC was mostly due to simply adding more police officers.  This hiring was done by Mayor Dinkins in response to the upcoming election against Gulliani, so Dinkins wouldn't get hit so hard on the \\"soft on crime\\" issue.  The lack of thorough research left me wondering if the other examples were half-baked; leaving me wondering how thin the ice would get when I tried to implement some of the book's ideas. <br /> <br />Lastly, there is a bit of unsubstantiated world-view sprinkled throughout the book that the reader has to be careful about.  Statements like \\"companies, like individuals, have a tough time translating thought into action...\\" (chapter 7) or \\"If individuals are not treated as though their knowledge is valued...they will hoard their best thinking and creative ideas...What's more they will reject others' intellectual worth as well...\\" (chapter #8) <br /> <br />Again, this is worth a read, but mostly for chapter #2.
B000062YB1|4.0|Yeah..I love this..Hey..Crunch and crash..Bay-bah..\\"SPirits in Black\\" is the best song ever..F yeah..Find me a better album in terms of Spirit..Ghosts of War is a similar song on South of Heaven..Yeah..LaVey the Secret Life of a Satanist..would be proud..F yeah..Crunch..Kerry and Jeff turn me on and Tom bangin' his head from side to side..F..Love..
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon does it again!!! The man is a genius.  From Alien 4 to Buffy the Vampire Slayer Joss Whedon does not dissapoint and firefly is no exception.  A quirky blend between space opera and Old Western Firefly is a journey that involves much more emotions and a lot less technology than most sci fi space adventures.  With humor and relationships this show is a must for anyone who has enjoyed Star Trek, Farscape, or Buffy the Vampire Slayer.   This show goes above and beyond my expectations
B0006L16N8|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album.  X & Y is an exellent, wonderful, incredibly good, etc.  Every single song has something unique that makes it special. As mentioned before by other reviewers, it takes so time to like it but after a while you are not going to take it out of your cd player(mp3,computer, etc.). <br />   <br />-- \\"Square One\\" is a great introduction to the CD, Chris' vocals are amazing in this song. Live is simply fabulous. <br />-- \\"What if\\" has beautiful lyrics and that \\"Uhh, UHHUU that's right\\" part makes me keep listening to the song.   <br />-- \\"White Shadows\\" is propably the best song of the album, the beats and overall musical performance is awesome.  Martin's solo at the end of the song shows his quality as a singer.  <br />-- \\"Fix You\\"'s attributes i think are the lyrics and vocals, not one of colplay's favorites but still very good.  <br />-- \\"Talk\\" is an average song but it has very good instumental background.   <br />-- \\"X & Y\\" is a relaxing song, slow, kind of a depressing but it has something that makes it stand out.  <br />-- \\"Speed of Sound\\" is the clocks of this album, I consider it very average though.   <br />--\\"A Message\\" is good, the guitar plays a big role in the song, very romatic and sweet.   <br />--\\"Low\\" would be my second favorite of the album.  It's very rhythmic and it's by far the song the would make you want to dance the most.   <br />-- I love the lyrics of \\"The Hardest Part,\\" and the beats are great.   <br />-- \\"Swalloded in the Sea\\" is very simple compared to the other songs but it just works great.  <br />-- \\"Twisted Logic\\" Has a great riff but its not the best song to finish an album. <br /> <br />One last thing....\\"Things I don't Understand\\" should have been added to the album. If you have a chance listen to it... One of my Coldplay's Favorites... <br /> <br />COLDPLAY = BEST BAND EVER...
B0000028MA|5.0|Paul Westerberg is not a Seattleite, but who can tell from this cd!  Westerberg was put in charge of the music for Cameron Crowe's early 90's homage to 20 something love AND the Seattle music scene.    And what he came up with on this cd is the best snapshot EVER of a vibrant music scene! With the exception of himself (a Twin City alum) and Chicago's Smashing Pumpkins Westerberg has assembled the cream of early 90's Seattle rockers.  These songs are arguably some of the best work ANY of these bands did.  These songs were penned and performed at every one of these ensembles pinnacle!    If your a fan of ANY ONE of these bands you've got to own this cd!    My personal favorite, however, is Smashing Pumpkin's \\"Drown.\\"  I heard it 10 years (or so) ago on Chicago's WXRT.  The song grabbed my ears and wouldn't let go!  Drown is a cross between Brian Eno and Neil Young.  Ethereal vocals to start, followed by 4 minutes of the most EXCITING feeed baaack you're ever gonna hear!    But all songs are outstanding!  Again, if you like ANY of these bands, get this cd SOONER rather than later!!    Oh, and by the way, the MOVIE is also a must own! It's a great story with great stars AND Eddie Vedder, Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam are the \\"backing band\\" to Matt Dillon's \\"Vedderesque\\" lead singer/songwriter character.  And they actually do a great job as actors!    Enjoy!
B000002HRE|3.0|Seriously,this album can't hold a candle to any other of Metallica's works,except for Load.Fuel is pretty good and I thought maybe Metallica gave up the Load approach to songs,but the rest of the album is pretty much crap.Unforgiven II was always bound to be compared to its prequel,hence making it was a stupid move.It's okay,in fact,but the solo is seriously terrible.I don't want to believe that this was GUITAR GOD Kirk Hammett playing those solos,because they are not worthy of his name.They tend to fizzle out about a millisecond after they start and instead of pumping you up they make you want them to get over.Not what I call vintage Metallica.'Where...things are' is sufficiently creepy but there is not much substance in there. <br />      In conclusion,I think this is a must buy for any fan who has heard the first four albums since this sorry effort will make you appreciate them much more.
B00005JNTX|1.0|The main purpose of the filmmakers was to make it look, panel for panel,  EXACTLY like the comic. Mission accomplished.    As for plot and characters that we care about what happens to, this movie is a complete failure. The film is a mish-mash of several of the comic's stories. It all ends up as a complete mess.     The make-up for the more bizzare characters looks ridiculous next to the more human-looking in the cast. And as for Miller's tenth-rate, \\"hard-boiled\\" dialogue...some things are better read in a comic book than actually spoken. It comes off real cheesy.    Stick with producing over-priced comic books, Frank.
B000062YAY|4.0|F Yeah..This is good..Yeah..Angel of Death..South of Heaven..Slayer is the ultimate live concert experience..\\"Dido and Aneas\\" by Henry Purcell is a good thing, but this is GOOD IN CONCERT..Reign in Blood..They whip their hair around and bang and churn out..So fast, South of Heaven's peaceful chimes..Like the Dalai Lama giving a lecture..Yeah..Their fast, and cool..Love, Vanes
B00005JO0J|5.0|I am a fan of Sci Fi, and was motivated to go see this by a glowing review by Orson Scott Card (author of Sci Fi classic Ender's Game). I intend to see this at least one more time in the theater, and will no doubt buy the DVD. I am further compelled to buy the Firefly series on DVD, since I was instantly impressed with the interaction of all these very strong carachters.<br /><br />The most important thing to me in Sci Fi is to make me feel I am glimpsing a plausible future universe, and this movie succeeds in presenting a people who are immersed in futuristic setting that isn't phony-seeming. The actors use technology and dialogue that describes an unknowable background of having always been aware of thier world, as we are of ours. But the producers don't make the mistake of having a ten minute conversation over every contraption they interact with. For example, they refer to a camera as a capture. I can relate to that. I would be clucking my tongue if the writers had instead opted to call it a \\"multimedia 3D imaging module\\". Sadly much of what passes for Sci Fi serves to stroke the ego of the prop designer with such nonsense.<br /><br />It was a terrific and moving production, and I can attest that this opinion is not relegated only to die-hard fans of the TV series. I rarely watch broadcast TV, so the series was unknown to me prior to the buzz surrounding this excellent film. But I am now a big fan of this crew's interplay.
B0002GTX4Q|5.0|Let me start by saying that this is not a film that will appeal to mainstream American audiences.<br /><br />The first thing that we should note is this was shot with a rare type of film reel(I'm not in the business, so the name escapes me, but I think it was 16mm) that only allows 20 minutes of consecutive filming before they have to quit and re-load.  For this reason, most of the scenes were shot with one take, and most of the dialog was improv(a la \\"Curb\\").  If you watch this movie, that is something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Something else should also be noted.  Gaspar Noe is the director of all scenes except one:  The Tunnel Scene.  As stated above, they had a 20 minute time limit to shoot that scene, and Noe allowed actress Monica Bellucci to direct the whole thing.  So while she was the victim in the scene, she was in complete control the whole time.<br /><br />On to the film content.  It is a day in the life of a middle class, young French couple...told backwards, a la \\"Memento\\".  So the audience sees the horrible end to the day first.  All you know at that point is that two normal, and assumably straight guys are looking for a man called \\"La Tapia\\"(The Tapeworm) in an incredibly seedy gay sex club called \\"The Rectum\\".  Their search ends when one of them bashes in the head of a man they think is \\"La Tapia\\".  This scene is very up close and graphic, as we see this man's head slowly disintegrate under the blows of a big fire extinguisher. Then we flash back to a series of scenes where we learn that these two guys are normal guys, who really aren't that street smart.  They're on a mission that we don't about yet and are getting help from some mafia-type street thugs, and a tip from a street prostitute is what led them to the club after \\"La Tapia\\".  Then we flash back to a party where these two guys are having varying degrees of fun, and one of them fights with his girlfriend(Bellucci), and she decides to go home by herself.  She starts to try to find a cab or bus or something, but another woman outside tells her to take the tunnel because it's safer.  That's when we see a very graphic depiction of a most heinous violation of the human body that seems to go on forever, with the perpetrator commentating(taunting) the whole time.  Another reviewer said people walked out of the theater he saw it at.  I can understand that as this is not the normal Hollywood depiction of this act.  This scene could not be shot as it is here and get even an NC-17 rating from the MPAA.<br /><br />The rest of the movie shows the life these three lead, and the hope that pervades their lives and relationships.  What this film makes the viewers feel will be different for everyone, I beleive.  I felt a profound sense of sadness at the end, seeing the couple as they lived and went about their life as a happy couple, knowing that it would turn out to be the worst day of their lives.  The two romantic leads were together in real life at the time this movie was filmed, and it shows in their apartment scene together.<br /><br />This film was mentioned to me as something that would shock and disgust me.  But at the end of the movie, I felt neither shock nor disgust.  Like I said above, I felt sad for the characters.  This movie was much better than I thought it would be.  I recommend it to adults who think they might like the story, or who're deadened to main stream Hollywood fare and want something different.cab or bus or something, but another woman outside tells her to take the tunnel because it's safer.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|Don't write reviews if you don't know what you're talking about.  people read these reviews and use them to decide whether or not to buy this album.  If you're putting false info up, it's hard to decide what to think.     I say this because lots of the reviews for City of Evil say that Shadows isn't screaming because of the popped blood vessels in his throat.  That is completely false.  He had to have surgery for that vessel about 2 1/2 years ago, but that has nothing to do with the change in sound.  The band as a whole decided to change directions and do something that in my opinion is way better than what they were doing before.  If you don't believe me, check out (...) and listen to the Lovelines interview.  Then write your review.  I know it's fun to think you know what's going on, but I don't want to read your crap that I know is wrong.    On to the review - Go buy this album.  It's amazing.
B0000AI45P|5.0|For years I felt certain \\"Marquee Moon\\" was the best album of one very good year, 1977 - a year that also gave us the second and third Ramones albums, debuts by the Sex Pistols, Clash, Talking Heads, and Chic, among others, not to mention two Bowie/Eno collaborations and Iggy's great comeback, \\"The Idiot.\\" Other reviewers here will describe this band's amazing chemistry - Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd were an astonishing guitar team; a jazz-inflected drummer (Billy Ficca) and a bassist with a fine producer's ear (Fred Smith) provided solid & inventive bottom and contribute to Television's greatness. The passion and lyricism of the music suggest a New York \\"Layla\\" but that doesn't begin to suggest this band's originality. What I will add is that Rhino's recently expanded edition \\"Marquee Moon\\" - 1978's \\"Adventure\\" gets the same respectful treatment and generous helping of unearthed bonus material - is well worth the investment even if you've known and loved the original album these past 25 years: in addition to an extra minute added to the classic title track (which faded out at 9:58 on the original LP), we get the group's astonishing 1975 debut freakout (and that it was issued on 45 is positively bizarre): \\"Little Johnny Jewel,\\" like \\"Marquee...\\" a long exploratory track, split into two parts on the original, impossibly rare Ork single, is riveting from Ficca's bristling rimshots to Verlaine's restless guitar improvs, with a Blakean lyric and the band's potential laid out before you in seven-and-a half exhilarating minutes. Add fascinating, bracing alternate versions of several album cuts (\\"See No Evil,\\" \\"Friction\\" with it's hard riffing towards the end never replicated on the released take, and eleven minutes of \\"Marquee Moon\\" itself) and a terrific, unreleased \\"A Mi Amore\\" - a speedy hard rocker and early live favorite included here in an instrumental version from the \\"Adventure\\" sessions (yes, it would have fit better as one of that set's bonus cuts). The entirework - with dazzling remastering runs just under 80 minutes. What else can I add? The gorgeous digipak reproduces all original LP graphics, including Robert Mapplethorpe's classic photography, the original black & white inner sleeve, the red 7-inch Ork single, plus highly informative liner notes and many photos. Whether you've been digging this since its '77 release or are simply curious about this band's rep and influence, Rhino has lovingly restored Television's two Elektra albums for the 21st century. The generous collection of bonus  material adds a great deal to the band's too-slim ouevre. After you get the new versions of MM and \\"Adventure\\", you'll probably want more: Rhino has thoughtfully released a terrific live album from June 29, 1978, \\"Live At The Old Waldorf\\" (sonically way superior to ROIR's pretty-good-bootleg level \\"The Blow Up\\"), and then? Track down Television's 1992 reunion album for Capitol (called, strangely, \\"Television\\"), Tom Verlaine's solo classics \\"Dreamtime\\" (1981, best heard on Infinite Zero Archive's expanded 1995 reissue) and \\"Flash Light\\" (1987, now on Collecter's Choice), and don't forget Richard Lloyd's 1979 solo debut \\"Alchemy\\" (also on Collector's Choice) - if you're like me, you'll be hooked and want the rest of Velaine's and Lloy'd work.
B00005JNTX|4.0|How much violence does a movie-viewer tolerate? Be it cult or not, it is frightening how such a movie celebrates what Kill Bill and others started: Being extremely violent is and looks sexy. A psychogram of today's society. Besides that a brilliantly filmed movie with convincing actors in a weird story. Who cares? It is a comic strip movie with real actors behaving like their sketched alter-egos. Certainly not the real life. It is definitely Frank Miller's very dark and hopeless world. Every single shot looks like a frame out of his books. I'd recommend it only for a very mature audience but I know that kids will watch it first...
B000053VBL|3.0|The Bride Wore Black is yet another average film by the always irregular French director Francois Truffaut. Truffaut is such a talented director that it's a shame he never quite found his place before his untimely death. Barrowing elements from Hitchcock, and mixing it with some oddly placed comedy, The Bride Wore Black is a mishmash of cruelty and farse that never comes together to form anything coherent. Visually the film is good, and the music is nice and fitting, but none of these elements saves the ridiculous story from veering off in too many different directions. The Bride Wore Black is ultimately a film that doesn't know what it wants to be, just as Truffaut never quite found what type of films he wanted to make.
B00005QXDD|5.0|If you own a CD copy of the Tenacious D album & are puzzled by the backwards message between \\"Karate\\" & \\"Rock Yer Socks Off\\" you should get a turntable & go to yer nearest mom&pop or small-chain record store & pick up a vinyl 2LP copy of the D album. <br />this way you'll be able to spin the record backwards to reveal the backwards message.  & besides, the D rock harder on vinyl than on CD & tape! HEAR THE D ON VINYL OR I'LL TAN YER @#$% HIDE@! ROCK!!!
B000002IGP|5.0|Originally unleashed in 1984, 'Out Of The Cellar' was the band's stunning debut effort. Never really cared for the term 'hair band'. That makes it sound like a bunch of guys that can't really play that come out onstage every night and fluff their hair around - like Danger Danger and Trixter. Ratt, at least for the first three lp's played some seriously good '80's heavy metal, I always thought. Tunes that more than make the grade are \\"Wanted Man\\", the old MTV favorite \\"Round And Round\\", \\"Lack Of Communication\\" (my personal Ratt favorite), \\"Back For More\\" and \\"I'm Insane\\". A true classic. Highly recommended.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|I just don't get it. Try as I might, I just cannot understand why everyone so heavily praises A Perfect Circle. I know they're on par with Tool, and sound original, but they really just aren't that special. Give them credit, Thirteenth Step is better, sonically and fundamentally, than Mer De Noms, but it's nothing to write home about. The band was obviously shooting for an intense, dark, layered sound, but it comes off as forced and schizophrenic. The album is too damp, and wallows in its own good too much to be taken seriously. Even Tool tried to hard to make an impression, with their intense, foreboding sound and downright creepy music videos, but I just didn't get the whole craze. APC is no different. The music is hard to describe. Melodic, yet insanely forgettable. I always find myself saying, \\"Wait, how'd that go again?\\", instead of not being able to get it out of my head. Bands like The Clash make you want to start a revolution. A Perfect Circle makes you want to play something else.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Once Upon a Time in the West is Sergio Leone's epic masterpiece, and is one of the greatest westerns ever made. After honing his skills on The Man With No Name trilogy, Leone was given a huge budget from Paramount to create his ultimate vision of the mythical west. Along with noted Italian directors Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento, Leone created an outlandish revenge and redemption story that fits his operatic style perfectly. Leone is one of the most patient filmmakers, and he shows it here with great style, especially in the beginning scene. Ennio Morriconne's haunting score is one of his best and most memorable, and the cinematography (as with any Leone film) is lush and exotic, creating landscapes that become characters themselves. The acting is really second hand to the nice visuals, but Henry Fonda steals the show as the notorious villian Frank. Once Upon a Time in the West is the pinnacle of the artistic western, and is the definitive film of Sergio Leone's career.
B000002HHB|4.0|As far as female artists would go in 1995, that year would be dominated by Alanis Morrisette and her \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album.   While Morrisette's debut album caught the attention of the music industry, there was another female artist who captured a lof of attention.  That artist was Natalie Merchant.   Merchant had left the band 10,000 Maniacs to pursue a solo career.   During her tenure with 10,000 Maniacs, the band slowly built up a solid following and Merchant had gotten a lot of attention as a musician and vocalist.    When Merchant would release her debut album, \\"Tigerlily\\" - it would not only capitalize on her fan-base with 10,000 Maniacs, but also would gain a lot of mainstream attention.    While Merchant is best-known for being a vocalist, \\"Tigerlily\\" really showcases her ability as one of the top songwriters in the business.   I'm very surprised that this album did not get some consideration for Album of the Year. <br /> <br />Merchant's \\"Tigerlily\\" came along at the time when Alternative Rock was now beginning to takeover the mainstream music scene.    I can best describe Merchant's music as Coffee-House music.   This isn't music that is going to make you get up and dance.  However, this is mellow music that is really geared at someone who takes an introspective view of music.  Much of this view is developed by some of the outstanding lyrics that Merchant supplies.    While Merchant may have a reputation for her piano and keyboard work, this album is filled with some outstanding guitar and percussion work by a very good supporting band.    This collection is recorded and engineered extremely well.   You can almost pick out every individual sound that comes from the instruments that are played on this album. <br /> <br />Here is a look at song by song: <br /> <br />\\"San Andreas Fault\\":  This song uses the San Andreas Fault in as a metaphor.   Basically it talks about how the earthquakes in California that result from the San Andreas Fault cause hopes and dreams to crumble.   The topic of hopes and dreams crashing down is a theme of this song. <br /> <br />\\"Wonder\\":  Not only is this a song that discusses a \\"gifted child\\", but the one thing that really is good is how Merchant writes this song from the point of view from the \\"gifted child\\".  There is a good mix of piano and guitar in this song.   This song was released as the second single from the album. <br /> <br />\\"Beloved Wife\\":  Once again Merchant does a great job at writing from another perspective.   This time, Merchant writes a song from an older man's world who now has to go on after losing his wife.  Not the catchiest song, but once again powerful lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"River\\":  When I first saw this title, I had a pre-conceived notion of what this song what about.  It turns out that this song wasn't about a \\"river\\",  but a tribute to the young actor River Phoenix who would pass away back in 1993.   At the end of the song, Merchant goes to the perspective of someone observing the fans of River Phoenix who were in pain following his death. <br /> <br />\\"Carnival\\": This was the first single that was released from this album.   In my opinion, not only is this song the best song on \\"Tigerlily\\", but this might is the best song of Merchant's career.   In fact, I felt that this song was the best single for 1995.   This song reflects all of the great things about the \\"Tigerlily\\" album - great lyrics and great instrumentation.   From a lyrical standpoint,  Merchant uses the idea of a Carnival as a metaphor for all of those things going around her in the world.   It's the music that blows me away.  You can hear the great combination of guitar work and piano work.  There is also some nice percussion done in this song.  In fact, this is a song where you can really hear each of the individual instruments.   This song makes uses of some terrific soprano-like background vocals.    Commercial radio played a radio-edit version of this song, but hear you get the full version including the intro and wrap-up (to be radio-edit versions never do any good from a musical perspective). <br /> <br />\\"I May Know the Word\\":  This is the longest set of the collection clocking in at over 8 minutes. I found this an interesting song.  The song begins with almost an R&B feel, but then transfers to a soft alternative rock feel. Once again, the guitar chords are easy to pick out with a three-dimensional feel to the sound.  Merchant steps things up with the intensity and emotion of her vocals. <br /> <br />\\"The Letter\\": This is a short song, but the theme is simple.  Merchant discusses about sending a bitter letter of her thoughts to a lost former lover. <br /> <br />\\"Cowboy Romance\\":  This song has almost a quasi-folk music feel to it.  Merchant sings this narrative from an observer to a relationship between a drunken cowboy and a woman. <br /> <br />\\"Jealousy\\": This was a short song that was released as the third single of the album.  Despite the topic of the song \\"Jealousy\\", I still found that this track had a more upbeat feel. <br /> <br />\\"Where I Go\\": This song has almost a Mexican-type folk melody.  Merchant's vocals are almost reminiscent to the style of Norah Jones today.   <br /> <br />\\"Seven Years\\": This is an underrated track.   Merchant delivers her most intense vocal performance on the collection.  In this song, Merchant delivers a \\"testimony\\" from a woman who has been betrayed by her lover.   Merchant's piano work shines here. <br /> <br />The liner notes contain all of the lyrics as well as the production and musician credits.   Overall, this is a very good debut album.  This is one album where you really want to follow along with the lyrics.   While this isn't going to a collection that makes you get up and dance, there is some very good music here.   This album also really helped contribute to the Alternative Rock revolution of the mid 1990s.   Definitely an album worth checking out.
B0007IN318|4.0|Dateline, August 79 AD: Marcus Attilius Primus, a young, savvy aquarius, or water engineer, has been sent from Rome as replacement for the AWOL Exomnius to ensure the proper maintenance of Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that supplies Pompeii, Herculaneum and the towns on the Bay of Naples. Investigation into the problem of the aqueduct drying up and its failure to deliver its critical liquid payload uncovers not only municipal theft of water and graft of epic proportions but natural problems and concerns relating to Vesuvius and its pending eruption - tremors, pollution of the water with sulphur emissions, rockfalls, and shifts and bulges in the earth's surface, not to mention breakages and blockages in the aqueduct itself.<br /><br />Insofar as the eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum are concerned, we all know how the story ends. So it fell to Harris' skill as a writer to build and maintain momentum and suspense in spite of that. With the clever device of a brief excerpt from a scientific treatise on volcanism serving as a preface to every chapter plus absolutely scintillating descriptive writing, what might have been a monumentally boring exposition of the final few hours leading up to Vesuvius' cataclysmic eruption becomes rather a thrilling natural history page turner that actually had my stomach twisted up into knots as I felt the clock ticking toward the inevitable catastrophe!<br /><br />The resolution of Exomnius' disappearance and the discovery of the theft of water by Numerius Popidius Ampliatus, an ex-slave and now Pompeii's wealthiest citizen, serve as a springboard for Harris' outstanding description of an extraordinary cross section of daily life in the ancient Roman provinces - slaves vs freemen, men vs women, and children, the luxury and indolence of the wealthy vs the difficulties and squalid conditions of the poor, politicians vs their constituency, the use of the \\"games\\" as a means of distracting and buying off the general population, the baths, and the Roman diet. His charming portrayal of Pliny the Elder and the discussions surrounding the aqueduct problem will amaze and delight readers with the surprising level of sophistication of Roman science and engineering.<br /><br />Sadly, the d&eacute;nouement after the eruption and Harris' winding down of the romantic involvement of Marcus Attilius with Corelia Ampliata, who is promised under a contract of marriage to one of Pompeii's leading politicos, just doesn't come anywhere close to the standards of the first three-quarters of the book! What might have been a five-star book that I was tempted to place in my \\"Top Ten All-Time\\" list became merely good as I closed the covers on the final few chapters! Too bad, for sure, but 4-star recommendations are nothing to sniff at! Pompeii was well worth my time and I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />Paul Weissthe baths, and the Roman diet.

B0006IIPIK|1.0|I had hoped for a retro thriller. What I got was a retro yawner. Defying the laws of physics, storytelling and good sense, this movie was so astoundingly bad that I'm now at a loss for words on how to convey the shear... <br />Nevermind. Trust me on this one.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|Wow! This movie has everything! Let's see...Animal torture,child pornography, drug addiction, prison gang rape, murder, suicide, death and maiming by dynamite, digusting goth wannabes having sex , and to top it all off, an unborn baby commits suicide! Too bad the script writer couldn't read his own work and take himself back to a time before the movie began shooting. I don't really know what I wanted from this thing before I watched it, but it wasn't the feeling I was left with after the fact. But, don't take my word for it, watch it if you want to, just know before hand that this piece of cinematic excrement should be avoided like the plague. Plague, wait a minute, there may have been one of those in there too....
B00007GZR5|3.0|This is a typical Robin Williams film, sentimental to the extreme which is fine if that's what you are expecting. If you are expecting a true rendition of Richard Matheson's book then forget it. The only similarity to the book is that Chris Nielsen, the main character, dies and discovers there is life after death. From thereon in the story differs wildly. The book focuses more on Chris's voyage of discovery in the afterlife and on his being drawn to his wife whose grieving is preventing him from fully letting go of his earthly life. The film sees the poor woman left grieving for not only Chris, but her two children who have been killed in a car crash.<br /><br />All that aside, is this a good film? It depends on your expectations. The effects are excellent and the colour rendition of `heaven' is truly amazing if somewhat Dali like in its surrealism. Heaven is portrayed a place from a renaissance painting. Hell is shown as a dark and despairing place, pretty much as you would expect but again filmed with flair and a brilliant eye for detail. Chris's guide through the afterlife is played, with style, by Cuba Gooding Junior. Visually this film is a feast but the storyline will leave most viewers depressed and drained. It isn't a comfortable movie to watch. Unlike the book which, although very sad at times, portrays a more positive note, the movie leaves you with a feeling of  desperation that so much tragedy could happen to one family.<br /><br />It is probably worth viewing this film at least once as long as you are not depressed at the time...just keep tissues by your side. It isn't a movie you would want to watch time and time again.
B0007GAERG|2.0|I love this album.  What I don't love is the fact that she is re-releasing it on November 15 with four new tracks, including the new single \\"Don't Forget About Us.\\"  Way to go, Mariah.  Great way to thank the 3.5 million fans who contributed to your comeback...  to make us all go out and buy it again.  I hope everyone goes out on that day and buys Madonna's new album instead.
B000003TA4|5.0|The album that changed pop music!<br />I remember well when it came out how dead rock had become. I loved classic rock but never understood the whole \\"Metal\\" thing.<br />It seemed the idea behind most of the metal releases was to scare the listener with sound and image. I guess I heard Smells<br />Like Teen Spirt first but it didn't make the strong impression on me it did so many others. It took Weird Al to change my mind on that one. Then I think I heard Lithium next and it caught my ear. I new something was going on with this group in a very big and positive way but didn't understand it at all. It seemed at the time it was a generation X song and I was the last of the baby boomers and isolated from it.<br />Then I heard Come As You Are and was completely hypnotized. Nothing has ever struck me the same before or since. For the first time in my life a really important band was in their heyday and I could be there to live it out with them. Maybe I might even get chance to see them in concert (never happened)! The song was mysterious, liberating and rejuvenating all at the same time. I rushed to again try to start-up another lost cause garage band. At anyrate, by that point I was completely sold on Nirvana as the best act since the early 70's.<br />Not to take away from the other tracks which round out a perfected album. Breed, Polly, Drain You, On a Plain all major tracks  crucial to Nirvana's catalog. In Bloom also had a big impact on me at it's release. I thought somehow Kurt was talking to me when he said..\\"he's the one that likes all our pretty songs and he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun, but he don't know what it means..\\". I'd never paid much attention to lyrics before and was completely baffled by Kurt's. It inspired me to listen and think more about what was being said. Territorial Pissings and Lounge Act being tracks that are often overlooked but truly stand out as excellant tunes.<br />Something In The Way although a great soft acoustic song saturated with emotion seems somewhat out of place as does Polly. Polly, one of the groups oldest original songs, seems to appear on most Nirvana albums in different forms. In this track it's been recorded almost identically to the original demo. The acoustic treatment somehow brings out aspects of the song in overtones, etc., not heard in electric versions. Given the harsh, hard drive of most of the other tracks in this release the softer quieter tracks reflect the broad expanse of influence at work in the band.<br />This disc changed my musical opinions and attitudes once I got familiar with it.

[...] he wrote and produced some of the most beautiful music on this earth. and no matter what you do to john lennon's voice, it still sounds like an angel.  i love the choir and strings he added to the ballads, especially \\"across the universe\\".  in fact, i think the choir and strings should be louder.  buy the original version of let it be, not this.
B0000286CH|5.0|Every song on this album is a work of art in its own right. Jean-Jacques is at his usual top form in writing sublime lyrics, and Celine is a genius in interpreting it. My favorites were Je Crois Toi, On Ne Change Pas and L'Abandon. <br /> <br />The songs on this album were even more beautifully rendered in her live performance on \\"Au Coeur Du Stade\\" so if you liked this, you'll love that one as well !!! <br /> <br />Keep bringing it on, Celine and Jean-Jacques.
055357342X|5.0|The third book of this series finds its characters sinking deeper and deeper into desperate situations.  As usual, Martin's writing is absorbing, his characters fascinating.  What sets these books above the rest is that not all the characters survive and prevail, as you would expect them to, which makes for even more suspenseful reading.  The ending to Storm of Swords is a shocker (don't peek!) and I am holding my breath until the publication of the next installment.
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is simply Nirvana's crowning acheivement crystalizing all that made this group stand out from the rest. Cobain is at his peak as a song writer, lyricist and guitar player. Although reports indicate some degree of tension in the band at this point it is certainly not apparent in the finished release. These tracks contain some of the most poignant and personal songs written by Cobain. In his earlier recordings most of the thoughts, feelings and emotions Kurt wrote of were masked by characters in the song. With the release of Nevermind Cobain was gaining confidence and began writing in a more first person style. On In Utero, Cobain holds very little of himself back and exposes some of his most honest inner thoughts.<br />The opening track Serve the Servants opens we Kurt telling us...\\"Teenage agnst has paid off well, now I'm old and bored\\"!<br />Scentless Apprentice is a sublime release of tensions and frustrations. A very compelling track sounding quite underground and experimental / improvisational in both music and lyric.<br />Heart Shaped Box is an immaculate conception of beautiful soft guitar contrasted by eclipsing distortion and intensely anguished lyrics. Perhaps their ultimate release. I've read a great deal about this song and still really don't know for sure all that's being expressed. So many of Cobains songs and aspects of his life are contradictory it can be tough pinning things down sometimes. I think Kurt enjoyed this aspect of his persona and often contracdicted himself merely for the fun of it.<br />Rape Me is the contriversal sequel to Nirvana's Polly ironically describbing the rapist being jailed and raped by his cellmate. The song made several executives at Geffen at MTV nervous. Not unlike so many of Nirvana's tunes it has an amazingly simple chord structure which is very compelling. Kurt was always so gifted at crafting melody and lyric. Rape Me is another example of how much Kurt had developed by this release.<br />Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle is a standout track that is often overlooked in the Nirvana catalog. Another example of the perfect mix of music & lyric. Kurt used the sad story of the tragic Hollywood star abused and cast out by the industry to voice his opinions to the executives and exploiters vying for a piece of the band.<br />Dumb has a sweet melody, very soft and gentle with lyrics expressing Kurt's mixed emotions at all the hoopla surronding the bands success. The track was unqiue in that it seemed to indicate a new direction for Nirvana and Kurt displaying a new range in sound and style as did Pennyroyal Tea and All Apologies.<br />Pennyroyal Tea conveys much the same emotion and feel of Dumb, however also reflects Kurt's desire to \\"distill the life inside of me\\". Again one of the songs that indicated a possible new directions for Nirvana's next big release had there been one. In an interview Kurt expressed a desire for the next album to have a less convential approach using less melody and more unique sounds replacing traditional guitar, bass and drums for the rhythm tracks. However in researching other bands and musicians typically their initial ideas for upcoming projects and seldom carried out in the end as had been intended. We'll never know what a \\"next\\" Nirvana album would sound like so I guess it's a mute point.<br />Very Ape is an all out rocker allowing the band to stretch their muscles as it were. The lyrics are strong and to the point. One of Kurt's more memorable lines \\"If you ever need anything please don't hesitate to ask someone else first\\", is a sentiment I recall often when I happen on certain acqaintances. The track ends with Kurt repeating \\"Out of the ground, into the sky. Out of the sky, into the dirt\\"! It's really wonderful sounding very cynical and cyclical as it winds down to an end.<br />Milk It sounds quite underground and experimental. The kind of track executives would most likely be unwilling to put money into without the previous success of Nevermind. In fact it's said the they were very concerned about the harsh style and sound of some of the initial cuts of the discs tracks. The song contains the line \\"look on the bright side is suicide\\", which in hindsight is hard to hear.<br />Radio Freindly Unit Shifter is another one of Kurt's comentaries on the music business combined with a free form jam style rhythm track. The closing verse containing what seems honest advice \\"Hate, hate your enemies. Save, save your freinds. Find, find your place. Speak, speak the truth\\"!<br />Tourtte's, based on the disorder were someone is unable to control themselves from shouting out moans, groans and curses gave Kurt a chance to just let it all out. The track starts off with I think Krist saying \\"Moderate Rock\\" and then bursts with a quick drum roll and power chords. Pure power with a punk twist.<br />To this day I find it hard to listen to All Apologies. It sounds so personal and upfront. Kurt has totally exposed himself and is laid bare and unprotected for all to see, hear and judge. The common thought is that the song was written to both Courtney & Frances Bean. It's such a moving song with it's quirky riff and submissive lyrics. Listening always makes me feel that Kurt's speaking directly to us about what would happen in April of 94.<br />After his passing the radio stations in our area seemed to use it as a eulogy run over and over again. The more the played it the more pain I felt over the loss.<br />I seldom listen to this disc. It's my all time favorite of Nirvana's and seems to be the most personal and telling of Kurt's work. But when the tracks are done and the songs come to an end I'm left feeling the giant hole inside that was left back in 94. An empty space where something had been but is no longer.<br />I pray that Kurt has found peace and that his daughter will be able to live out her life in happiness and health. I also pray for Dave & Krist for there could never have been such music with out their talents, devotion and heart. It pleases me a great deal to see how well The Foo Fighters have done. There's no one even close to them at this point in pop music. I hear good things about Krist, that he's happy and living well. I hope we get to hear more from him in the future. I think he's far to talented to simply fade away.<br />Thank God for Nirvana!t's said the they were very concerned about the harsh style and sound of some of the initial cuts of the discs tracks.

B00005NWM3|5.0|Now I'm not gonna lie and say I've always been a Nickelback fan. Infact for the longest time I believed in the hype that said Nickelback were the worst band around. I wouldn't even listen to them. I believed them to be the worst band ever. But then from time to time when I was on the way to work with my buddy he played Nickelback. At first I was like, why are you listening to this crap? Then I started getting into it and bobbing my head. I then decided to get thier 2 albums Silver Side Up and The Long Road. Now not all the songs on the albums are great. But there aren't many bands that can say they have a perfect album. But the songs that are great on Silver Side Up make up for that flaw. The 2 best songs in my opinion are How You Remind Me and Never Again. How You Remind me is actually what turned me on to Nickelback. This and Figured You Out were my first to favorite tracks. Then the rest of the songs just grew on me and I find myself singing along to them. I'd avise you all to check out the new album All The Right Reasons. Photograph is an amazing heartfelt song that most of us can relate to. So just give this band a chance and forget the media exposure that goes with it. And don't be afraid to like a band that maybe the rest of ur friends think sucks.
B000002JR8|1.0|Man, finally someone w/ some balls. <br /> <br />All you hear now days is how \\"Awesome\\" and (hahahaha) \\"Legendary\\" this music factory for utter retards band called  Pantera is. Dimebag Darrle was not legendary at all, i think people are just saying that now because he is dead. Pantera was an absolutly horrible band to begin with, i don't know how you idiot americans can like these racist hicks from texas. <br /> <br />Pantera hater is one of the few people who actaully has the corage to speak his or her own opion about this cr@p band. You idoits just insult him because he has got his own opion about your favorite little douche band. <br /> <br />Just remember back in the 1980s, when we had real heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Preist, Running Wild or Accept. Ignor any one that tells you Dimebag was good in any way, because he wasn't. Just because you Pantera fans are starting to get a spell of historical revisionism about how good this band or Dime was, doesn't actaully change history or that fact that these guys completely sucked.

1592400876|5.0|I loved this book! The best part was the description of the Apostrophe Protection Society. I'm also driven crazy when I see an apostrophe used to denote the plural rather than the possessive, and that happens so often (e.g., CD's instead of CDs).<br /><br />I also lament the excessive use of emoticons, adverbs or exclamation marks, although sometimes, I get a kick out of telling my nephew, \\"ur up 2 late tonite ;).\\"  However, I'm not likely to add \\"LOL\\" to any of my work-related letters or to forget the conventional rules of English in my job.<br /><br />Shoots was a great way to learn more about proper punctuation in a way that didn't feel like homework.<br /><br />Sigrid Mac<br /><br />PS For some reason, I accidentally hit the three-star button when I reviewed this and now I can't erase that, but I think it's a five star book.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I went to see the concert before hearing any of the album.  I was fortunate to get front row balcony in a small theater.  Good Lord, Robert blew me away, talk about a rock star.  The coolest cat on the planet easy.  I listen to the album every week.
B00001QEE9|5.0|Walt Disney's 1940 Pinocchio is the classic tale of misguided innocence in the dark and sinister world of greed and temptation.  The tale of a little wooden puppet completely naive about the evil surrounding him, the most perfect start to a grand and spooky tale which begun in a beautiful starry night. <br /> <br />The old, kind-hearted toy maker Gepetto had just finished his latest masterpiece, a wooden string puppet that showed off the most beautiful colors and grade, however, the toy maker feared that it was still missing something, a life.  So, that night Gepetto made a wish upon a shining star, wishing for the life of his \\"Pinocchio.\\"  That same night, a beautiful blue fairy payed a visit to Gepetto's workshop and brought his wish to life. <br /> <br />Having the wise Jimminy Cricket for a conscience, Pinocchio sets off in the real world in the task of leaving for school, unfortunately some wrong turns take him into the darker worlds of pure evil and greed.  Bad influences are a strong match for Pinocchio and his faithful companion, but Pinocchio's rising spirit helps him overcome temptations and mis-guidances and bring him back to the warmth of his home and gain his heart's greatest desire. <br /> <br />This outstanding film was the second full-length animated feature completed by Walt Disney and one of his finest masterpieces.  I'd recommend renting the film for kids and grown-ups alike are sure to love it.  When it comes to buying, I suggest waiting for the future Platinum release that should hit the shelves withing a few years.
B000148KK2|5.0|Average 3 stars?! Please, you've got to be joking! I hope that all who read these reviews will not let that stop you from purchasing an awesome, intelligent & deep jazz album!  <br />I have been a fan of Diana Krall for some time & love her versions of some of the best jazz standards ever written. Little did I know how much of a talent she is creatively as a songwriter!  <br />The first time I listened to this CD, I admit, my ears were not prepared for what I heard. (Thankfully I read on amazon that much of the songs she wrote with hubby Elvis Costello. Which by the way increased my interest in the CD!) But reading the lyrics while listening to the music, I found this to be an exceptional CD which I have listened to over & over again...and not during dinner/cocktail parties!  <br />This CD never puts me to sleep, yet when I need to relax it does get me there like her other CDs...but with more of an emotional & inspired impact. I highly recommend this disc! It is pure pleasure to listen to such creativity coming from 2 musical geniuses, Diana & Elvis (what a pair!). Not to mention one of the best covers of Joni Mitchell (Black Crow)! Diana delivers this with such passion that I wish she would do an entire CD of Joni's songs! Amazing!!! <br />Thank you Diana! <br />
B000002B35|5.0|This is the best live album ever made... and they do a fantastic job on every track. BUY IT!!!!!  The performances are in a leauge that can not be touched. This is pink floyd at their best... the album is worth just to hear David gilmour's hot solos on just about every track
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|It's very good. Better than the mediocre rock that exists now. No rap in songs :)
B000002N2P|5.0|You wanna know the truth? I totally love this cd, like the others! Green Day makes good music! When I'm tired I listen to it! I'm feeeling Insomniac! =) Buy this cd if you like Punk-Rock music, if you don't really know Green Day, try that one, Nimrod or Kerplunk! I wish you will fell in love (like me, and millions of fans) with all theirs succes! <br /> <br />The music videos on this cd are Stuck With Me, Geek Stink Breath, Brain Stew/Jaded and Walking Contradiction. <br /> <br />Listen before talking!
B000002ADT|5.0|\\"Kind of Blue\\" is the best selling jazz album of all time.  Odds are, if you're reading this, you're curious about it, and there's a good chance you're new to jazz.  God knows, I've recommended this album myself literally dozens of times, and I've seen several folks whose collections include this, even if its in the vast minority of jazz CDs in their collection. <br /> <br />So I've chosen rather than to do my usual review to provide some historical context for the would-be listener to understand how a record of this much popularity in an (even then) fading genre came to be and to argue why I recommend this to folks as their first jazz album. <br /> <br />So in 1959, Miles Davis was on top of the world-- several years clean of heroin, signed to a major label, and with a band that included future jazz legends John Coltrane (tenor saxophone), Bill Evans (piano) and Cannonball Adderly (alto sax) as well as a rhythm section as good as any in jazz-- bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb.  He'd already recorded a number of artistic triumphs by the sessions for \\"A Kind of Blue\\", but where \\"Workin\\", \\"Round About Midnight\\" or \\"Miles Ahead\\" would be the peak of a lesser artist's career, Davis was on his way up. <br /> <br />And while he'd artistically triumph somewhat better than \\"Kind of Blue\\", he'd never triumph moreso commercially.  Entering the studio with his band and a few sketches (essentially a bunch of melodies and scales to play them with), he recorded rather quickly and with few alternate takes, \\"Kind of Blue\\".  The album is moody and sensitive, and without the constraints that jazz normally imposed in terms of chord changes (this was scale-based), Davis was able to dig a new level of expressiveness that didn't require as much focus on where the piece was going. <br /> <br />So what was the result?  An album that is pretty much perfect-- the right musicians playing the right music at the right time-- the pieces have a sense of melancholy to them that Davis really digs in deep to-- certainly he excels most at moody ballads and this one is filled with it, but with players of such stunning talent as Adderly and Coltrane, a pianist of such stunning sensitivity as Evans, and a rhythm section as flexible and sympathetic as Chambers and Cobb, the music becomes more the sum of its parts-- more than just even Davis' vision.  The music is sacchrine sentimental (\\"Blue in Green\\", \\"Flamenco Sketches\\"), exciting and hot (\\"So What\\"), moody and bluesy (\\"Freddie Freeloader\\") and just plain stunning (just about everything, but especially \\"All Blues\\").  More to the point, it's inoffensive without being either dull or lifeless or overly feeling like product. <br /> <br />And it's this element that makes this such a great place to start looking into jazz-- most folks complain that jazz is too abstract, that there's no concrete melodies, that it comes and goes quickly and they can't process it, it's too busy or it's too unengaging (or sometimes both).  This one is laid back, relaxed, based on strong melodies, but it doesn't FEEL like it is.  There's no sacrifice made to get all these benefits, it just is.  And with such a strong cast of musicians, it serves as an introduction to several greats in jazz and gives you a further place to look. <br /> <br />My point-- there's a place for this in everyone's collection, and it's marketed cheap enough to make it worth taking a chance on.  And certainly ten years after first buying this, there are many jazz records I prefer to this one, even several by Miles Davis, but I still play it because being popular doesn't make it stop being good.  In truth, if you only buy one jazz album, this should be it.
B000002UB3|5.0|What an album. With the collapse of the most beloved band in the world nearing, the Beatles put together Abbey Road, their final contribution to the musical world. And they didn't disappoint. Featuring such rock classics as \\"Come Together,\\" \\"I Want You,\\" and \\"Something,\\" as well as the world renown \\"Oh! Darling,\\" the first half of the album is a collection of great songs that have survived the test of time. The second half, the wonderful medley that is famous to Beatles fans but perhaps little known amongst others closes the album and the Beatles' career perfectly. This may  not be the Beatles' best, but it's close. Highly recommended.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|Samuel L. Jackson delivered a great performance in Coach Carter! Everything about it makes it a wonderful movie to watch!! It's the true story of making his team winners both on and off the court! I thought the movie delivered a powerful message about sports and the classroom. It's another one of the message movies like \\"Radio\\". It's a movie I highly recommend and would make a great gift.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is beautiful. It's inspiring. It's emotional. There are so many ways you can describe this album, but in the end, it's nothing short of a masterpiece. This is, in my humble opinion, the magnum opus of the greatest band of our time. Every song flows wonderfully into the next, and no one moment on the album stands out as the best because every song is just as good as the last. I don't understand now how I could have gone so long without noticing these guys. My musical world is forever changed. This is a MUST OWN for any music fan.
B0009UC810|5.0|It was 25 years ago when the antics of Jake and Joliet Jake came onto the silver screen. Today the humor and music come alive with the Widescreen 25th Anniversary Edition! If you enjoyed it then then you will enjoy it now with more added scenes! Despite some of the vulgar words it's a lot of fun entertainment, great car chases and the music is fantastic. My favorites...James Brown and the \\"Old Landmark\\" and Sweet Home Chicago! It's a Mission of Great Entertainment!!
B000002UAU|5.0|I don't need to say much, so much has already been said. <br />I do want to address many reviews this album has received that are nothing but jokes, saying it would be better if mixed with rap songs. This is ridiculous. These joke reviews are all that's bringing this album's rating down. It's an historic piece of music and a triumph. The fact that it was made almost 40 years ago doesn't change its greatness. If you don't own this album, what are you waiting for?!?!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Apparently one of the spotlight reviews is from a Beatles fan who thinks Pet Sounds is not a great album because it's been compared to various Beatles albums?!!!?!? Don't really see the logic there. Just a person who wants to believe everything by the Beatles is the best.  <br /> <br />Pet Sounds more than stands on it's own. No album matches it in it's scope, cohesiveness (It is the first concept album), studio production, and influence.  <br />This is a record where you can believe the hype. You can listen to it 100 times and each time find something new. Any Beatle comparisons are just to give someone a historical perspective on the music of the 1960's.  <br /> <br />I'm not going to write an essay on why Pet Sounds is the greatest. So much has been written already and Capitol Records released a four cd boxset, \\"The Pet Sounds Sessions,\\" that attempts to shine light on Brian's God-Like skills in the studio. <br /> <br />Buy Pet Sounds and get ready to expand your mind.
B00005B4GU|3.0|I love Radiohead. If anyone asks me for my favorite band, I don't hesitate to scream out \\"Radiohead!\\" with pride. <br /> <br />But this...I just don't know what to say about Amnesiac. It's not a bad album, but after The Bends, OK Computer, and Kid A, it surely is a disappointment. It doesn't stand anywhere near those three or Hail to the Thief in terms of great records. The biggest problem with the album is that it's very inconsistent. It has great songs like \\"Pyramid Song\\", \\"You and Whose Army\\", and \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" next to subpar efforts like \\"Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors\\" or \\"Hunting Bears.\\" I think it's pretty obvious that some of these songs were B-sides never originally intended for release.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I'll keep it simple. I love Pink Floyd and especially Gimour's electric guitar. Most of his work is acoustic and I still say this one is well worth it. A must for fans of Pink Floyd and David Gilmour. Enjoy, I sure have!
B00004XONN|5.0|How does a band follow up to a commercial and critical success that receives \\"Best Album Ever\\" reviews on a frequent basis? It's certainly no easy feat, but Radiohead follows up to their masterful OK Computer with Kid A, an album equally as creative and original as its predecessor. While not nearly as accessible as OK Computer or The Bends, this album may take a few listens to really appreciate, but the time is well worth it.  <br /> <br />The album begins with \\"Everything in its Right Place,\\" a song that is, in my opinion, the perfect choice for album opener. The simple yet effective keyboards at the beginning of the song is a great way to begin the musical journey that takes us through a world of electronica and computerized effects. While most bands that use computer effects use them ad nauseam, Radiohead's use is brilliantly constructed to only enhance the music. I love how the band introduces a wide variety of instruments on songs such as \\"The National Anthem\\" as well. They truly reached out into the musical world to find the sound that suited their vision best. <br /> <br />With Thom Yorke's beautiful vocals backed by an ensemble of talented musicians, a grand time is guaranteed for all on this effort. Radiohead gives us another brilliantly crafted, essential album.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|best album I have heard in ten years. The National manages to find a whole new vien of pop music that doesn't bring to mind any easy comparisons. I have had people say, Tom Waits, Lou Reed, Mark Knofler but that only covers the singers voice not the texture of the songs or the sophistication of the whole package.
B000002UAO|4.0|This album is often credited as the second best Beatles album, behind only the smash \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" I feel this is unfair to their later releases. There is no doubt that the music on this album is fantastic. I love Rubber Soul. It's the first album made by the Beatles that explored creative musical styles and serious lyrics. It's the first in their later, more productive era. But that isn't enough to make it their second best. They were just beginning to scratch the surface of original music, and they did a great job, but they would master it later in their career.
B00000IMTG|5.0|I confess; I'm a die-hard Dio-era Rainbow fan. These guys were everything Black Sabbath would kill to be, but could never be (Iommi can't possibly do what Blackmore does on the guitar, due to his fingers having been chopped off in an accident years ago and Ozzy has always been too stoned to recognize his own mother, let alone remember what key he's supposed to sing in).    Here, we have the entire band in top form - and, thankfully, somebody did a good job with the electrics, so the hum from the Strat's single-coil pickups wasn't too frustrating for Ritchie (he often cancelled concerts simply because of this; yes, he's a dyed-in-the-wool perfectionist), Dio's vocals are as great as ever and Martin Birch's production is, predictably, top-notch.    While I don't care that much about the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" intro to \\"Kill The King\\", this album simply makes the listener wish s/he was there to experience the concert(s).    As for Dio's perforance on \\"Mistreated\\", it makes you wonder why Deep Purple bothered hiring Coverdale in the first place.    One note regarding the mixing, now, because it shows the stance taken regarding the soundstage created during playback (you need a decent stereo system to hear this, forget your PC's speakers and those cheapskate tin cans sold en masse by various Jap and Korean manufacturers as \\"hi-fi combos\\"). On the cover of the album, you see from left to right:    Tony Carey with his keyboards, Jimmy Bain with his bass, Cozy Powell's drums, right in front of him is Ronnie and Ritchie is to the right. Of course, the audience is in front of them.    You'd expect this to be what you hear, right?    Wrong. Birch decided to put the listener ON THE STAGE with the band. You basically stand next to Cozy's drums, Ritchie is on your left, Tony is on your right (the bass is everywhere, as those frequencies are non-directional) and, in the distance, you hear the audience. And it's a very detailed and analytical recording; with the right equipment, you can hear EVERYTHING that happens on stage.    Basically, think of this album as a time machine and an onstage pass!
B000002TQV|5.0|Many people have called this Radiohead's \\"most accessible\\" album. I disagree. If a friend of mine wanted to listen to them for the first time, I wouldn't hesitate to give them my copy of OK Computer, because I think it's a much stronger album. So, if you're a first time listener who wants to start with the best, I don't think this is it. It doesn't have the creativity of Kid A, the simple fun of Hail to the Thief, or the complexity of OK Computer.  <br />These issues aside, I still think it's a great album. While I feel it pales in comparison to the three releases following it (excluding Amnesiac, of course), what album can compare to these? Radiohead is an amazing band, and this is the first of their essential albums. It's a great listen, and I highly recommend it.

There are a few parts that only require the smallest amount of macarone to complete the transformation of Cheese of Death - but other than that, this is a kick ass album. <br /> <br />The bonus DVD that comes with the CD is excellent... giving us all an enlightened peek at who's what and what's when and when the whats are who. <br /> <br />With some killer guitar playing from the likes of Jeff Water (Annihilator)....  oh yeh - make sure you check out the blast drumming from Mike Smith (Suffocation).... that dude is pure molten metal <br /> <br />GO BUY THIS CD NOW
B000092ZYX|5.0|A lot of Radiohead fans seem upset with this album. After the lackluster Amnesiac, this album was supposed to bring Radiohead back into the world of unbelievable, earth-shattering, blow us all away music. And it does. The only problem: Radiohead will never be able to live up to the expectations. They've made such amazing music in the past, no matter what they put out now, it'll be trampled upon by at least some people. <br /> <br />These concerns are unfounded. This is a fantastic album. I don't see why it isn't included in the band's \\"Essential Recordings\\" page, because it deserves to be there. If you've listened to Radiohead before and enjoyed it, get this album and be impressed again. Well done, boys, I can't wait for another brilliant piece of work.

THEY SOUND GREAT AND WHILE THIS CERTAINLY IS NOT CREAM IN THEIR PRIME IT IS THE NEXT BEST THING AND A JOY TO WATCH. I WAS APPREHENSIVE BUT MY FEARS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY. CREAM WAS THE FIRST SUPERGROUP WHO PAVED THE WAY FOR LED ZEPPELIN AND MUCH OF THE HARD ROCK AND HEAVY METAL THAT FOLLOWED. THEY MAY BE OLD BUT COMPARED TO WHAT MUSIC IS OUT NOW THE MUSIC OF CREAM SHINES BRIGHTER THAN EVER AND THIS DVD PROVES HOW SPECIAL THIS BAND WAS AND STILL IS TODAY. THIS IS THE MUSIC OF HEAVY BLUES WITH THE LOSS OF SOME POWER BUT MAKING UP FOR IT WITH CONVICTION AND DETERMINATION. SWEET WINE INDEED. GET THIS DVD IF YOU ARE A FAN.

B0009WFFS6|3.0|I know you cannot turn the clock back and these guys are getting on a bit but I prefer the DVD of their farewell concert. Just compare Erics playing White Room on this DVd with his playing of it on the farewell DVD! I think the big mistake that Eric makes on this reunion DVD is that he should have used Marshall stacks and his Gibson guitars..........the Strat is a good guitar but if you want to sound like Cream you have to use the heavier sound of the Gibson also where is the wah?? The recording is too slick like Erics Me and Mr Johnson CD.....boring and with no Thunder or energy. I am sorry to have to write this having been a Clapton fan all my life but feel he is going the same way as Rod Stewart.........boring old farts!
B00008OLYN|5.0|The only regret I have about Damnation is the fact that I haden't listened to it earlier. Today, I went to the record store to buy another cd. I didn't find that cd. That's probably the best thing that has happened to me in a while. As I grazed the Opeth section, I decided to buy the only cd available - Damnation. (I am a big Opeth fan gradually building his collection)  <br /> <br />I knew this was Opeth's lighter, more progressive, acoustic record. However, I did not expect it to be this incredible. I've already listened to it twice, once at my computer and the other while I was out for a walk. This album is touching yet chilling. The amount of talent this band has is unprecedented. <br /> <br />Deliverance, in general, was said to be my favourite Opeth cd, but I can't demote this one. The songs are beautifully orchestrated. The soft electric guitar solos complement the crisp acoustic tones. The keyboards set such an incredible atmosphere. The drums roll in complete unison.  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Opeth in any way, or if you're a fan of unique acoustic sounds, this record is for you. This is not simply an \\"experimental\\" record - it's not one of those in between records. This record is the real deal. Every song stands out. As soon as I began listening to \\"Windowpane,\\" I knew it would escalate. I've only listened to it twice, but it is jaw-dropping across the board. I'll be listening to it again tonight. <br /> <br />I'm still beyond words.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|I mean, the music is one thing, but I am beyond ecstatic about the incredible packaging that was selected for this record!  Just ecstatic, I mean, who really cares that much about what's on the disc, what we all really CARE about is the packaging.  Am I right?
B00000JCOV|1.0|Don't get me wrong. It's not that i don't like hardcore bands or music that is made with passion, but it's just that. <br />this band is continually supported by people claiming that it is poetic and passionately expressive, but in actuality it is just 9 people getting together and making a lot of noise while someon screams about how everyone hates them and how terrible people in the world today are. This id the kin=d of thing that i find disgusting and am shocked that people actually buy it. <br />I would encourage you to buy a cd by The Mars Volta or by At the Drive in if you want to hear actually strongly passionate music and something by opeth if you want to hear actually good heavy music. <br /> <br />this band is just the worst in the history of the world
B000002KCI|5.0|Good stuff culminating with Cortez. Neil's music in the 70's was by far his best
B00000634J|4.0|Excellent fidelity. Any CD that includes \\"Working Class Hero\\" automatically gets bumped up a star. And I understand that art and commerce are inextricably linked. But I sure would like whoever made the decision to put the trimmed down version of \\"Mother\\" on this collection to explain him or herself to me.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Franz Ferdinand's follow up to their platinum debut is stellar. More musically varied and textured than the debut, the band provides several Beatlesque ballads as well as some kicking Kinks like rockers. The production values on this album are stronger as well. Aside from this, I've gotten to see this band in Atlanta, Chicago, Paris, Denver, and LA - and they have to be one of the more exciting/energetic live acts around.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This might be the best tv show I've ever seen. It's worth every penny. The only dowside it that I wish there were many more episodes. Watching this series might lead to obsessing over it for weeks and not being able to talk about anything else. So you might loose a friend or two, but you gain a whole space ship full of new imaginary friends, that will last you a live time!
1896597890|4.0|This short graphic novel by French Canadian Guy Delisle managed to be humorous and frightening at once. It's a story of his two-month stay in Pyongyang while overseeing the production of a popular French children's cartoon. Delisle is not lost on the sad irony of his position, and tells his story simply and without pretense.<br /><br />The book deals mainly with how frustrating life is in the capital, even for a privileged foreigner like him: bad food, constant surveillance, blaring propanda songs, etc.<br /><br />It's probably most affecting when you get a real sense of the inner lives of his guide and translator. Both are very buttoned-up, proper and repressed. At one point Delisle lends one of them his copy of \\"1984\\"; when the guy returns it a week later he seems very nervous and mutters something about how he \\"doesn't like science fiction.\\" On the other hand, he rejoices when he gets a bottle of Hennessy as a going-away present.<br /><br />In the most terrifying episode Delisle asks his guide where all the handicapped people are in Pyongyang, and the guide responds that there aren't any handicapped people in North Korea. Yikes!<br /><br />Highly recommended to any fan of first-person graphic journalism.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I have not given it as much time to sink in as ( ), but with this album it seems that Sigur Ros have developed even more as artists and have managed to harness their elusive and mysteriously beautiful sound in a way that is more immediate and encompassing than their previous releases.<br /><br />I'm not sure which language they're singing in anymore, and I think that ( ) proved how unimportant that detail is. Sigur Ros is not about the words, and I have no intention of hunting down a translation. It doesn't matter. The vocals are about the emotion that lies bhind their concealed intention, and are treated as another instrument.<br /><br />Takk... is more 'uplifting' than I expected it to be. ( ) was overflowing with an insinuative melancholy that was at once beautiful and nostaligically lonely. This album is more of a celebration, and the songs soar and hit orchestral peaks that take you to places most other bands don't even try to.<br /><br />It is comforting to see at least one band out there doing their own thing and getting better. While so many other formerly great bands are now producing dissapointing albums, Sigur Ros is pushing their art forward. The album flows like one symphonic piece.<br /><br />See them live if you get a chance.<br />I'd also recommend Boards of Canada's \\"Music Has the Rights to Children\\" if you're into the music of Sigur Ros. They also manage to capture that sad, wordless longing for childhood nostalgia.

B000AA305M|5.0|Before you Throw Stones because this album is COPYWRITTEN!  Please understand that you are reviewing the music, and it's quality!  Not the Software it's written on, or the executive slime-balls that are pissed off about downloading free music....  I have file-shared Legally, this entire CD  and it's wonderful... it's incredible.  I'm a huge fan of David Gray, and you have to understand that he isn't the one that makes this the album copy protected or not, so don't badmouth a CD simply because you couldn't burn it onto your computer... Just warn your friends.  It's a shame that this CD will probably never get the full 5 star rating it deserves, but it should because the music is beautiful.  There are plenty of Filesharing sites, if you don't want to buy this cd because it's copywritten you have the Right to Download it!!!!!  Don't restrict your ears from listening to this golden Album!
B000003TBP|1.0|After hearing and reading the critical ravings from the four corners of the earth praising this album, I desperately wanted to like it. I listened...and listened...and I just can't hear what a large majority of listeners seem to hear. This sounds like cleverly constructed collages of noise instead of actual songs. Perhaps the aural equivalent of carelessly flung blobs of paint on a tilted canvass and then passed off as abstract art. This evidently appeals to quite a few folks out there.  As for me, I find the whole thing rather unfortunate.
0553571338|3.0|The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a future civilization with his two parents and sister, Lily. Everything is perfect and everything is the same every day. When Jonas becomes a twelve-year-old and gets assigned to his new job, his job is not a regular job -- it is a special assignment. He becomes the Receiver, a painful but important job. He must receive the memories of past times, good and bad. His leader, The Giver, has the job of giving the memories to Jonas.  <br />The author has a way that makes you excited and tense by changing everything in the story until it makes sense. It is unpredictable. It is a mix of confusion, adventure, and a little bit of sadness.
B00006JJ51|5.0|This alblum is hella tight it has great beats and cool rappers  like young dre or the man mc.ren but my favorite is R.I.P Easy E Also the best two songs are straight out of compton and F**k the police. So buy this alblum now!

B00005JOHO|3.0|While not an indictment of the movie itself, which was fairly good overall, I was shocked by the deceptive editing that went into the movie trailer.  (I just went back to the IMDB to review the trailer to make sure I wasn't mistaken). <br /> <br />The trailer appears to show Francis Ouimet demonstrating his golf prowess by driving a golf ball through a phone book.  Presumably, based on the scenes that precede it, this is done in the presence of a tournament selection committee.  Actually, the phone book scene takes place in a London pub and the ball is launched by Ted Ray, a British professional. <br /> <br />Also, the few clips of Vardon appear to show him as an arrogant snob, looking down on the likes of upstart young Francis.  Which is the opposite of how he is actually protrayed in the movie. <br /> <br />I gave the movie 3 stars because this movie was hyped as being a good 'Values' movie.  Well these are the values I got from it. <br /> <br />1)  Your word is only good until it becomes inconvenient <br />2)  Lying is okay just as long as you aren't very good at it <br /> <br />I make an issue of the values only because Disney has targetted specific markets with the 'Values' message. I find their conception of what constitutes values disappointing.
0316168815|5.0|Sebold's debut novel very much had what Stephen King calls \\"The Gotcha\\".  I was hooked from the very start.  Sebold's writing is both poetic and poignant.  Fresh perspective (the story is told from heaven by a main character that is murdered in the first chapter) and imaginative.  I have purchased this book as a gift for several women since reading it.
B00005JL96|2.0|Lilo and stitch is one of the most charming and lovable disney films ever and this single disc edition dvd is not bad either. With great picture, excellent sound and fairly decent amount of extras...few may have expected another dvd release but that's true. Disney had plans of releasing a very special 2disc masterpiece edition of lilo and stitch in 2005 but for some strange reasons it was delayed repeatedly and will be hitting the stores early next year.  <br /> <br />This special edition will include complete making of the film with running time over two hours, covering each and every part of the movie. There will be lots of interviews from the animators and directors, concept art, rough animation and other stuff too. And that's just not all. Other than this long documentary, there will be a commentary track from the directors, never before seen deleted scenes, art galleries...and lots more. It will also contain all the bonus materials from this single disc release. <br /> <br />With a full making-of documentary and other impressive bonus features, this lilo and stitch 2disc masterpiece edition dvd is said to be the best disney dvd release ever. <br /> <br />If you feel a little too restless with not even its release date out yet, here's some good news. This 2disc edition has already been released in Italy and UK (region 2) and is available from amazon.co.uk at a fairly reasonable price. <br /> <br />If you dont already own lilo and stitch on dvd but are planning to do so, get it from amazon UK or wait till this masterpiece edition comes out. Well, it will be worth all the wait and money spent. <br /> <br />
0765301598|1.0|In many ways, Dune is the Lord of the Rings of science fiction: An rewardingly inventive universe with a complex history serves as a stage for rich characters to play out their conflicted passions.  However, The Battle of Corrin is none of these things.  Most authors would love the opportunity to write a prequel to Dune, carefully divulging the tantalizing secret histories of the forgotten and celebrated. Sadly though, the authors pound out the story of the final battle between humanity the thinking machines as if it were an unwanted chore. They doggedly refuse to develop inventive themes in favor of familiar ones. Characters are one-dimensional tools used to keep the plot moving rather than engaging figures who make us want to read on.  And most disappointingly, many scenarios are solved with unrewarding \\"magical solutions\\" or contrived \\"silver bullet\\" schemes.   <br /> <br />Nothing in this book has the craft or care of the original.  If you want to explore the universe of pre-Dune, you might as well write it yourself because you wont be satisfied with The Battle of Corrin.
0062513346|1.0|Coelho has really gone over the edge with this nonsense.  Not one single incident is to be believed and instead of penetrating is funny.  He either overdosed on drugs or alcohol or was hallucinating.  I couldn't stop laughing at what I know was meant to be a very serious book. If Coelho believes this actually happened to him, he's in bad shape and can't be taken seriously. The promising author of Veronica Decides to Die is quickly deteriorating.  How sad!
B00005JKOI|5.0|It's hard to put into words the sonic boom to the movie industry that was Andrew McCarthy in the 80s. He simply took over whatever movie he was in and made it an instant classic. This movie had nothing going for it before they brough Andrew aboard with his total range. You had a complete nerd that was following around Molly Ringwald like a rotweiler follows a kid with a steak tied to his beltloop. Molly Ringwald isn't hot at all, which killed about 8 movies in about a four year period. I totally would have had some relations with Jennifer Conoli or Jami Gertz, but instead we were stuck with Ringbald. So you have a nerd, an ugly girl and a hot Annie Potts. She's yummy. The movie was going nowhere and kids were starting to get restless and then Andrew McCarthy decides to save this thing. He was dynamic as always with super cool facial expressions and great one liners like, \\"You need to love yourself before I love yourself\\". I could write 90 pages on how awesome McCarthy is, but let me simplify this thing. The original story had Ringdog ending up with Dorkie(or whatever the nerd's name is), but the movie producers understood that if a cool popular guy with money wants a girl, he gets that girl. I don't know why that is so hard for people to understand. I'm loaded and drop your groceries hot and if I want to go out with a girl, she goes out with me. I'm pretty much Andrew McCarthy and I make fun of people like Dorkie each day. I'm like the Beatles coming to america for the first time while you're Color Me Badd pumping gas at Exxon.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly, in my opinion, was a great disply of what an imaginative team can do with the sci-fi television landscape. I was sucked in by the recently released movie \\"Serenity\\" and immediatly went out and got the tv series. I was shocked that the show did not survive long due to a bad case of judgement from Fox. I reccomend this show to everyone who enjoys good entertainment. The characters are very well drawn, great humor, and combines scientific space rules and western technolgy. A fan of guns will love this series. 14 episodes in all, only one hope that the show will once again find a home on our television screen.

B000B5IPLK|5.0|I was really expecting much when I got this, since this is a live. But after a couple of listens, I'm really blown away. This woman got lots talent and I'm glad the music industry has a talent like this. She puts alot in her performance and you get the feeling she is doing what she is doing for the love of it. She carries so much passion and draws the audience to each performance, giving alittle spin to her old hits and 4 new songs. The stand out track on here are \\"Everylittle bit hurts\\", \\"Stolen moments\\" and Heartburn.
B00005MP58|4.0|A lavishly mounted drama series based on Jane Austen's classic novel, this is much more than a \\"chick flick\\". Boasting the lavish production values that one has come to associate with the BBC, steady direction from Simon Langon and a great ensemble cast, \\"Pride And Prejudice\\" offers great entertainment over five hours.<br /><br />I usually watch TV series on DVD by the episode, but this series was so rivetting, I made by way through it in two sittings, taking in three episodes at a time. And not once did the narrative drag, as the Bennet sisters made their way through life, meeting and romancing the men of their dreams.<br /><br />Much has been made about the leading stars Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle being too old for the characters as depicted in Austen's literary classic. Well, I haven't read the great book but let me tell you, they were perfect for the roles in this series - totally believable and capable of holding the audience's attention.<br /><br />The story is essentially about how the antagonism between Darcy, a wealthy and aloof single man, and Elizabeth Bennet, whom he slights at their first meeting at a country dance, changes into love.<br /><br />Equally good were Susannah Harker as the eldest Bennett sibling Jane, Alison Steadman as the whiney and irritating mother of the clan, David Bamber as the slimy Mr Collins and Benjamin Whitrow, who especially shines as solid-as-a-rock Mr Bennet.<br /><br />Of equal note are the magnificent mansions that feature throughout the series and their stunning surroundings, and the gorgeous costumes that perfectly capture the feel of Regency England.<br /><br />This series, which premiered on BBC in 1995, has been remastered for the DVD release and comes with glorious colour and in widescreen. The video is quiet good but there are some compression artefacts from over five hours of content being squeezed on to two discs.<br /><br />The soundtrack is plain vanilla stereo but benefits from being decoded with the Dolby Prologic II setting on modern home theatre receivers, as this allows Carl Davis' piano-driven score to shine. The dialogue, which is what really matters in a production like this, comes through clearly and without any distortions.<br /><br />As for this being a \\"special edition\\"....well, it really isn't. All you get is a 25-minute making of featurette that has the director, screenwriter and some other members of the crew talking about how they transformed the book into a workable script and chose the cast and locations. There isn't any contribution from Jennifer Ehle or Colin Firth and the featurette doesn't offer any new insights.ith the Dolby Prologic II setting on modern home theatre receivers, as this allows Carl Davis' piano-driven score to shine.

1400031087|4.0|James Frey wants his A Million Little Pieces to be the rawest and \\"realest\\" account ever written about rehab and addiction, and without a doubt, he's at his most gripping when the details are at their most gruesome and nasty specificity.  We spend nearly the first 100 pages amidst graphic descriptions of Frey's daily vomiting, we sit through the world's most painful root canal, we hear the litany of destructive behaviors that get people into the most reknowned rehab institution in America.  Yet for all of Frey's attempts to present rehab as it is, he winds up treading dangerously close to cliche at times - say, the moment that Leonard talks James from walking out on the clinic, James's daring entry into a crackhouse, or the guard who after a good verbal smackdown realizes the error of  his ways (not to mention an obsession with then-I-ate-some-macaroni minutae).  Because Frey's highly self-conscious writing style eschews indentations or justified lines or quote marks, he can distract you for a while, but the truth is that writing style is glaringly ostentatious and often devolves into bulky and irritating repetition (any number of paragraphs end with \\"key phrases\\" of the paragraph presented like a hipster summary).  That all makes A Million Little Pieces a book you can't put down, and even brimming with the type of earth-shattering honesty Frey strives for (a vivid post-script hits home the truth that only 15% of people seeking rehab treatment stay clean), but it's a less wholly compelling work of addiction than, for example, Elizabeth Wurtzel's More, Now, Again - a book that has the honesty and the eloquence.  Read this book more for its bravery in the face of whitewashing addiction than for its stubborn, compelling, and frustrating consciousness.

B0007Z4S4C|4.0|Mighty Rearranger, by Robert Plant, is a very complete and satisfying album.  Among the songs are: Another Tribe; Freedom Fries; All The King's Horses; Takamba; Dancing in Heaven; Let The Four Winds Blow; and Mighty rearranger.  \\"Another Tribe\\" appears to be like a protest song against war.  \\"All the King's Horses\\" is like a love song of hope around the corner.  When you listen to the album, you can tell that Plant put his heart into it.  Compared to Led Zeppelin albums, this one has a little bit more variety in it, but it still has the Led Zeppelin feeling.  I recommended it to people of all ages.  It will also appeal to peole with a variety of music tastes.
B0000004V2|5.0|I became a fan of Oasis in 1994, a fan of Blur in 1995, a fan of Ocean Colour Scene in 1996....I DIDN'T GET TO THIS ALBUM UNTIL 2001!!!  Well better late than never you know.  This album is one of the most amazing British rock albums ever.  The songs are flawless, the production is flawless, the musicianship etc., etc., etc.  It was like a version of \\"Revolver\\" for 1989.  Every Brit pop-rock band that came after these guys sites the Stone Roses as one of their primary influences....almost right next to or even surpassing the Beatles.  Not since albums from the late 1960s had a track sequence sounded so invigorating and cohesive.  This album belongs in anyone's collection who even skimps at British rock.  It's a masterpiece from beginning to end!
B000002J09|5.0|This Led Zeppelin album is the ultimate music experience.  With songs like \\"Rock N' Roll\\", \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Four Sticks\\", and \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", Led Zeppelin again demonstrates their abilities.  \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is still considered the best rock and roll song of all time, and \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock N' Roll\\" are popular favorites.  Compared to other rock and roll albums, this one is a mountain and the rest  are molehills.  If you are in search of an album you can listen to over and over again, you've found it.

B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II really established Led Zeppelin as a great band.  They immediately hit the charts with \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".  They followed that up with great songs like \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Livin' Lovin' Maid\\", \\"Ramble On\\", and \\"Bring It On Home\\".  Once you start listening to this album, you are enveloped in a great rock and roll sensation.  Many albums start out great, but are unable to follow up well.  However, this one is sound throughout.  I recommmend this CD to people who are familiar with and like Led Zeppelin.  If yoiu like them now and have not heard this album, you will like them even more.
0201721481|4.0|Let me state up-front that this is an indispensable book for me, and, as a reference, or as a source for expanding a basic C++ capability, it's easily worth 5 stars, not 4.  In fact, as an intermediate-level C++ user, this is the most indispensable book that I have.  I have 15 C++ books on my shelf, and this one (the fourth edition) is the most comprehensive, even surpassing Stroustrup's tome in most areas. (Stroustrup's influence on Primer is pretty obvious in spots.) The book's depth and its style of presentation, however, will mean that it's not the best primer for newcomers, and that's why I only gave it a 4-star rating.  Look at the painting metaphor expressed on the front cover of the book.  This book is more than a primer: it's a full pallet of colors, and as such is more than a beginner \\"painter\\" will be able to put to use quickly.  I need to clarify what I'm saying here.<br /><br />You might ask how a book can be the most comprehensive available without being longer in page count.  The answer comes down to style.  This book rarely expends space on full-length, executable code examples.  The treatment of nine out of ten subjects offers only snippets of code - not complete executable examples.  Many books offer examples that take up multiple pages for the code and multiple pages for the line-by-line explanations of the code.  This difference in presentation is the single biggest reason why C++ Primer can offer so much more thorough coverage of C++ language features in fewer than 900 pages.  The downside is, if you intend to learn C++, you absolutely must experiment with working code - there is no other way.  The fact that this book does not offer much complete working code means that you will have to spend more time getting yourself set up to experiment. This will be especially true if you are a beginner, just because it will be harder to get things working.<br /><br />The conciseness of code examples is matched by conciseness of explanations.  In this regard, however, I have found no downside:  the vast majority of explanations are extremely clear to the point of elegance.  I've found only a few flaws in clarity, which are probably left over from earlier editions.<br /><br />The tremendous depth of this book will be another weakness for newcomers to C++ who need to get started quickly. In my opinion, you just can't get started quickly when every treatment of every subject has to cover all of the ins and outs of that subject. There are too many subjects and too many ins and outs. If you try to go straight through the book, you'd better be prepared to work lots and lots of problems along the way: it will take so long to get through it that if you don't practice as you go, you may find yourself forgetting almost as fast as you're learning.<br /><br />The other side of the coin is this:  if you really do take this book, work through it from start to finish, and really master the material, you'll have a fantastic knowledge of C++.  I seriously doubt that three good college courses in C++ - assuming no prior programming experience - would teach as much.  The fact that you'll have to develop your own working code to demonstrate each feature will, like the depth of treatment, make you a better programmer, even though it seriously slows you down in the process.<br /><br />You can conclude, then that if you are a newcomer to C++, and especially if you are inexperienced with programming in general, this book will be a long, hard climb. I'd be willing to bet that fewer than 5 percent of purchasers of this book start at the beginning and work straight through.  Even so, if you are a newcomer taking a C++ programming class or just using another book to get started, it will be valuable for parallel reading and will come in very handy when you want to do a deep dive.  Finally, don't forget that if you have a basic grounding in C++ fundamentals and you want to grow from there, this is a dynamite, five-star opportunity.<br /><br />I feel like I have to elaborate here a bit as well.  Time after time after time, when I've wanted a better understanding of a really fine point on the language, I've turned to this book and been rewarded for doing so.  Every single subject is explained fully and, in most cases, eloquently.  You can learn to do a lot quickly in C++ using other resources, but C++ offers the ability to fine tune and get close to the hardware.  This book will make you better understand what the compiler is doing.  The authors took the time to make extensive use of cross-references, which are invaluable in a subject this complex.  The explanations, bolstered by cross-references, tend to leave me more than satisfied that I've gotten a grip. When I finish a section and have some example code executing, I feel like I have a complete understanding:  I rarely find myself asking, \\"... but what about ....\\"  I could go on and on, but you get the message.  (One reason I'm taking the time to write this is that I feel indebted to the authors!)<br /><br />The book builds up a consistent set of semantics - more so than any other book I've read.  One example is their thorough explanation and consistent use of the terms \\"declare\\" and \\"define.\\"  Another is example is \\"argument\\" and \\"parameter list.\\"  Unambiguous semantics are essential to unambiguous communication, and, as you know, programming is one of the most unforgiving disciplines there is; ambiguity is intolerable.  This attention to detail pervades the entire book, beyond just semantics.<br /><br />Also, like with Stroustrup's book, I don't have to worry about whether the authors got it right or wrong or only half-right. This is an authoritative work:  these guys know their subject as well as they know how to communicate it.<br /><br />I especially like the dark page summaries and glossaries that act as chapter boundaries. I like the highlighted notes, tips, \\"bewares,\\" and best practices. I like the blocks of text that address \\"cautions.\\" These features are value-multipliers for me.<br /><br />I also appreciate that there is absolutely no subconscious assumption that you already know C. That assumption seems to creep into so many other books, even though the authors deny it.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that this edition is a huge improvement over previous editions. (I have the second edition beside me as I write this.)  Frankly, I don't like the earlier editions.  My guess is that the new authors, who came on board for this edition, should get a lot of credit. (I know an absolutely brilliant guy who has done some real innovation with C++.  For example, he wrote a C++ library that allows you to write C++ in Python style, while getting C++ performance.  This same guy was so intimidated by an earlier edition of Primer that he put off trying to learn C++ for several years!  I'm still trying to convince him to get the fourth edition!)<br /><br />So the fourth edition is a vast improvement, but, assuming that we don't try to make it all things to all readers and stick with the objective of compact comprehensiveness, how could we improve it further? The code examples could be simpler. I think Schildt is the master of communicating through code examples, just because his examples do the best job of isolating on the subject at hand. C++ is an extremely broad language, and when I read about a concept, I don't want to be expected to know everything, especially code examples, that preceded it in the book.  Primer could do a better job - at least for me - in that respect. Examples should not be codependent:  each example should lean only on the preceding material as much as is necessary to get the point across.  Stated another way, OO programmers are big on encapsulation; OO tutorial writers should use the same rigor in encapsulating modules of tutorial text.  All experts agree that the best code is code that is easily readable.  In a tutorial, the meaning of the code examples should jump off the page.  Primer is not bad in this regard, but it could be better. Some will argue that leaning on previous material reinforces the learning of the material, and they will be right.  In my opinion, however, that argument applies mostly to course textbooks where the learning of diverse features can be forced into a tightly channeled sequence.  I often use Schildt and Holtzner for reference when I need a quick answer. (As an aside, Stroustrup's book is the worst, for me, in terms of code examples being unnecessarily complex and codependent, even though I consider his book second only to this one as an indispensable reference.)<br /><br />Bottom line: C++ Primer is an amazing accomplishment.  The authors have done the best job to date of sorting out and presenting in lucid fashion a vast and complex network of features.  I speak from experience as a technical writer as well as a student of C++.  I feel guilty for assigning only four stars, but I'm concerned about the newbie who sees a 5-star rating on a \\"primer,\\" and rushes to spend his limited budget on this book as a sole reference.  C++ Primer is a very wise investment if you are really serious about C++, whether newbie or expert, but most newbies will also need a primary resource that is more beginner-oriented.  Other books I recommend, in addition to the ones mentioned previously, include Prata (a good tutorial and a good resource for complete code examples, although there is significant codependence of examples); Lafore; Josuttis' classic STL book (definitely not for beginners); Schildt's STL book, also for its code examples; Keough and Gray (for quick reference only); and Safir and Brown (which does assume that you know C).res are value-multipliers for me.<br /><br />I also appreciate that there is absolutely no subconscious assumption that you already know C.

B000002GXJ|5.0|First of all, they need to put this album on one disc, because it's under 80 minutes, and it's really a rip-off to pay that much for just 78 minutes. The first issues of the first two CHICAGO double albums were two disc sets, and they cut them down to one disc, so it can be done. Also, is this a Joe Walsh concert? Or an EAGLES album? I don't want to hear &#34;Life's been good&#34; (even though it's a cool song), or &#34;All night long&#34; on an EAGLES live album. Let him play that stuff at one of his solo concerts!!! When you have so many great tunes, why do you waste precious album time playing Joe's stuff. &#34;Lifes been good&#34; takes about 9 minutes of valuable space on this live album. They could have got two of their great songs done in that 9 minute period. Tons of their stuff was left off like &#34;Witchy Woman&#34;, &#34;In the City&#34;, &#34;One of these nights&#34;, &#34;Lyin Eyes&#34;, &#34;James Dean&#34;, &#34;Already gone&#34;, &#34;After the thrill is gone&#34;, &#34;Sad Cafe&#34;, &#34;The last resort&#34;, and &#34;Tequila Sunrise&#34; to name a few. If they would have originally made it a 3-record set, instead of two, they could have got those tunes, plus a few more on this album, but hindsight is 20/20. Walsh is from my hometown Wichita, Kansas, so I shouldn't come down on him too hard for them playing his solo songs. When you get through my couple of gripes, they do play the songs that made it onto this album pretty darn good in my opinion. One great thing that came from this album was the great accopella (I'm not sure I'm spelling that right) tune &#34;Seven Bridges Road&#34;, which was one of the few EAGLES songs that my Dad really got into. It had never appeared on any previous EAGLES albums before. I wish they would have left off the songs &#34;Saturday night&#34; and &#34;Doolin-Dalton (Reprise II), because I've never really liked them that much. When I first purchased this album I hadn't ever bought &#34;Hotel California&#34; before, so &#34;New kid in town&#34; and &#34;Wasted time&#34; were real treats for me at that time. They play &#34;Hotel California&#34; very close to what it sounds like on the studio album, and really about all the rest of the tracks are the same as well. This could have programmed some better songs and it could have been a better &#34;Live&#34; album, but if you're going to only go by how good they play the material, this is played superbly and should get the full five stars, but I'll remove 3/10 off the full five stars maximum.<br /><br />M.A. Scotto &#34;New kid in town&#34; and &#34;Wasted time&#34; were real treats for me at that time.

014028009X|5.0|Time's tight for all of us. That's why you'll be tempted to skip reading \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" if you saw the movie. Don't!<br /><br />The movie is, of course, darling with cute Renee Zellwenger, uptight but decent Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as the epitome of the gorgeous, smooth-talking cad. However, the book is much, much better. You'll miss the uproariously funny details inherent in the format of Bridget's diary (e.g., counting cigarettes and calories, the despair of falling off the wagon, the recriminations common to all young women's diaries -- and low self-esteem). Reading this was like reliving my own misspent youth. By necessity, the movie had to shear big sections of the book out of the screenplay -- and you won't want to miss a juicy day of Bridget's year-long diary. Also, the movie treatment of some of Bridget's adventures just aren't as clever or funny as Helen Fielding's handling.<br /><br />It's a clich&eacute; to say you'll laugh out loud. But in this case, it's actually true. Don't miss reading Helen Fielding's gem just because you saw the big-screen version.
B000002GXX|5.0|If you haven't yet heard &quot;One of these nights&quot;, you owe it to yourself to do so. This great one, even beats the heralded &quot;Hotel California&quot;, but not by too much. Of course the three songs that made me want to get this one are &quot;Lyin Eyes&quot;, &quot;One of these nights&quot;, and &quot;Take it to the limit&quot;, but really, all the songs are a 10/10 rating on this gem. &quot;Visions&quot; is a really good song, and you can't go wrong with &quot;Journey of the sorcerer&quot; either. This great one closes with what maybe my favorite EAGLES song &quot;I wish you peace&quot;. That song almost always makes me cry for some reason. It's a great swansong for Bernie Leadon's soon departure after the recording of this album. This is the EAGLES creative peak. Though a lot would say that &quot;Hotel California&quot; would deserve that honor, I definitely would disagree with that. Enjoy this Eagles masterpiece!!!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Christian Bale's performance adds great depth to the characters of Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Cillian Murphy has incredible presence onscreen. Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine are impeccale in their roles. My only disappointment was Katie Holmes' lackluster performance. The movie is very well directed by the talented Mr. Nolan.  The storyline is fabulous.  Definitely the best Batman movie so far.
B000001FDQ|3.0|Starting with the legendary Les Paul, many electric guitar fret-shredders have come and gone but few have made good music and this album by Malmsteen is the last one worthy of consideration.    It is a fusion of heavy-metal guitar and classical forms and at times remarkably similar to Al Di Meola's fusion album Elegant Gypsy (just listen to \\"Race with the Devil on Spanish Highway\\").    But as fret-shredders before him have learned blazing speed and energy don't guarantee good music.      In the end, this album represents the height of heavy-metal rock guitar virtuosity, composition, and introduced heavy-metal to fusion.  But it still carries the heavy-metal traits of being forced and contrived.
B00079018K|5.0|They invented this thing a while back called a cd player.  They are also known as boomboxes, some come with a cassette player but newer ones have cd-only or mp3-player capabilities.  Most stereo systems or home theater systems will also play it.  Your car stereo should play it too, if it has a cd player in it(check your car stereo manual).  DO NOT PUT YOUR CD in the cassette slot, it might scratch it.  Hope this review was helpful or, at least, sarcastic.  Seriously people, great music deserves to be listened to and enjoyed anyway possible.  Write a letter to Kasabian, RCA, or BMG music to protest the copy-protection but you can still hear the cd on a regular cd player.  Or is that too 80's?
B00005MM01|5.0|The Black civil rights struggles were exploding, the student anti-war movement was at a fevered pitch and I was just coming out as gay, when I first heard this album. His music made it seem rebellious and delightful to be soft, warm, gentle, clever, and delicate. Donovan's poetry helped me accept myself by shaking my rigid concept of masculinity (which, of course, I failed to achieve). He created a dreamy, story-telling mood that included adventure and friendship as well as an outside-the-norm quality that helped me realize that there was a place for me. I absolutely loved hearing this album for the first time and I still love hearing it today. I highly recommend it.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|Is that we all know there's gonna be another \\"Ultimate, extra special, super-deluxe, grand martial, super conductor\\" edition coming out in the future.  The first was the regular one.  This is the director's cut with a few featurrettes.  The next will be the 2-disc version with both versions, a ton of extras(those deleted scenes everyone's talking about), and come with a free baseball bat or rollerskates bundled with the film(my personal guess, might not actually happen).  Keep whatever version you have, and get ready to buy the next one.  When the remake is done(one's in the works folks), there will be a publicity stunt with the original, and THAT'S when we'll get the \\"Meatnormous edition\\" of this movie on dvd.  So hold on for that if you want.  Btw, remember the good old days when gangs would fight hand to hand or weapon to weapon like in the movie?  Now today, they gotta hide behind cars with their automatics or whatever.  Lame.
B00009L1OB|5.0|Seven and the Ragged Tiger is a fantastic album, but is not as good as Duran's previous Rio and Duran Duran. The sound is darker and the lyrics more convoluted. I remember when Union of the Snake came out and no one could figure out what the song was actually about. My favorite tracks would have to be Crime and Passion, Tiger Tiger, Reflex and New Moon on Monday. I love the packaging and all of the concepts behind it. Overall, a good album.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I looked in the local stores for this for a long time.  I rented it when it was first released and thought it was a real sleeper. <br /> <br />My daughter suggested I try Amazon and voila!  There it was.  I was not disapointed.  It was as good as I remembered. <br /> <br />

B000002JAX|4.0|If you like the sound of Billie Holidays, voice you will be floored by the similarity in Madeleine Peyroux. I hate to say it but her voice sounds almost identical but has more range. <br />The music style isn't totally that old classic jazz sound but similar; some songs seem tinted with a New Orleans sound and some a tiny bit folk-like. Over all smooth, delightful songs. Not one of them is annoying which is lucky when buying an unknown cd.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|This cd is a great update from the previous,'Dreamland'. I actually couldn't decide which to buy because there were songs I liked on both, even though they are a little different. <br />If you are a lover of Billie Holliday this is for you. <br />It's like a continuation of her voice in a way. I hate to say but I do think Madeleines' voice is even better. The songs aren't exactly old classic jazz sound, but similar and at the same time something new. A beatiful cd with no bad songs.
6305949980|5.0|We received the movie in great time and in great shape.  We love the movie and it has been watched many, many times since we received it.
0688170528|3.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and I am not rushing out to get the next one.  It was a very quick read, but left me with many unanswered questions.  Why didn't Chris ever ask why Emily was suicidal?  Why didn't Em feel she had any other options?  Why didn't Chris turn to other sources to solve her problem?  It was if all the characters just gave up too easily which makes me as the reader not care very much about their struggle.
B0007GAERG|4.0|This album from Mariah builds upon the groundwork she laid out with her last release, Charmbracelet, but takes it to the next level.<br /><br />Mariah is in great voice for a majority of the album.  She does not sound as full as she used to in the past, but I think that's due to the way she's being recorded and not her physically.<br /><br />The format of choosing some gospel inspired material as well as 70's soul worked well on Charmbracelt and continues to work well on this album.  I think Mariah has tapped into a great groove.<br /><br />The uptempo songs which Mariah performs on her own are great.  The ballads that Mariah performs are some of her best work in the last 5 years!<br /><br />Mariah very wisely chose to collaborate with some great talent for this album, the result was a fresh sound which blends classic R&B/Soul dynamics into fresh licks from today.<br /><br />With all that said, I will say the same thing about Emancipation of Mimi that I said about Charmbracelet...I don't see the need for all the guest appearances. Enough is Enough alreay... They do absolutely nothing for Mariah... Half the time she sounds like she's singing around the other artists just so that they can be included on the cd as some sort of way to prove that Mariah is a Hip-Hop singer and as such has other Hip-Hop artists sing songs with her to prove it.... Is this really necessary?  As evidenced by It's Like That, Mariah can do fine on her own singing Hip Hop styled songs.<br /><br />If you are a true die-hard Mariah fan and one whose been a fan of hers from the beginning, then you know exactly what I'm talking about.  I'm not buying a Mariah Carey album to hear all these guest appearances.  I'm buying a Mariah Carey album to hear Mariah, plain and simple.  Sure, maybe a duet here or there would be good or maybe some of these guys would sound good as background vocals, but they just tend to clutter it up for me and inevitably result in me skipping past those songs to songs which are just Mariah.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being too harsh, or maybe I'm just a Mariah-purist, but I know I'm not alone in my opinon on the guest appearance thing...They just seem like filler songs that never really go anywhere and never turn into singles that get heavy radio play.... Mariah used to create albums where more than half of the album would be released as singles... Mariah should turn out more songs of that nature to help fully restore her to her #1 single status.<br /><br />Once again, I think this was an A+ effort from Mariah, but I think that she wants to have her cake and eat it too regarding the types of fans she creates music for which is extremely difficult to pull off and pull off well.<br /><br />Sure, the fickle young listeners like Mariah's music, but Adult Contemporary listeners, many of which were the first fans Mariah ever had and were the ones who bought the millions of albums that made her who she is, have also embraced songs like We Belong Together and Mine from this album, proving that Mariah can sing hip-hop influenced songs and this audience will listen.... and buy.  However,again, it's all the guest appearance fooder that Adult Contemporary audiences could truly care less about in my opinion.<br /><br />I am glad to see that Mariah, like the phoenix, has started her rise from the ashes.  I only can hope that her next album will have less guest appearances and more of what people really want, which is to hear that incredible voice on its own, unencumbered by any unnecessary bric-a-brac.ngs which are just Mariah. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm being too harsh, or maybe I'm just a Mariah-purist, but I know I'm not alone in my opinon on the guest appearance thing...They just seem like filler songs that never really go anywhere and never turn into singles that get heavy radio play....

B000AA305M|1.0|My blood pressure doubled when I saw that horrific \\"content protected\\" logo on this CD.  It makes me angry that the record label has denied my RIGHT to copy my music as I so desire.  I have an iPod, and if I can't directly rip it into iTunes, then there's no way the label will get a DIME out of me!  I am so furious I could scream!  The label can go *f* themselves!
B000AU9UYM|5.0|As a young child, i remember seeing batman returns in theaters. I being only 8 years old and not knowing much about batman or the back issues of the comics, fell in love with the story and the idea of a normal man dressing up like a bat to fight crime. Sadly though, i was only hooked up in the flash and dazzle of the movies and tv, and not with the core story of batman. <br /> <br />As i got older, i desided to re visit the batman films of the 90's and to my disapointment, these films were alot worse then i remember. i distinctly remember thinking, \\"wow, these films are for kids\\" and they were, espically the later 2 films. Burtons take on batman now seemed unworldly and gothic, were the other films seemed like the campy 60s tv show with better special effect.  In all, out of 4 films, not one managed to really capture the story and emotional pull of batman, and just treated him as if bruce wayne just one day awoke and said \\"gee, ill dress up like a bat\\" <br /> <br />Then came batman begins, a film i followed since the pre production stages. When i herd that batman would be alot more realistic, i thought, wow what a great idea.It worked for the xmen, why not take a respectful, realistic aproach for batman? <br /> <br />and to my suprise, it worked, and worked extremly well. For once we're told why and how bruce wayne became batman, why he desided to dress up like a bat and how he got \\"those wonderful toys\\". And for once, he was the focus of the movie, and not the villian.  Also, the villians werent overly flamboyant, or wearing silly cosutumes, but were done well and believable. Scarcrows mask isnt just for show, same as the bat suit. Each has its purpose. Also, the action isnt over the top matrix style nonsense. Ive often found myself chringing at the fight scenes as people are sent flying and end up hurt. <br /> <br />As for the story, pure genus. It takes its cues from the best of the batman graphic novels, and yet combines them together to form a well thoughout and told story that shines new light on batman and his motives for what and why he does what he does. <br /> <br />overall forget the 90's batman. there last centuries take on the dark night. If you wana see the real batman, check out batman begins.
B000002WU9|5.0|Well,when we talk about mafious rap,we can't forgot Raekwon The Chef,member of Wu-Tang Clan,that with his first solo album have created a new kind of sound and style.Under his sharp rhymes and his metrical solution there is a RZA...ahr,Bobby Steels without shaolin rules:just latinamerican's struments.Arps and violines rule on tracks,so the atmosphre is unbelievable.Near Rae...ahr,Lex Diamonds (once upon a time was Lou Diamonds)raps Tony Starks,aka GhostFace Killah,aka Co-Chef.Tony works on twelve tracks making performances just for hip-hop real lovers.In the cd there are also collabos with all Wu-Members,from GZA to the tenth WTC Cappadonna,and with a hot rapper straight from NY,Nas.Nas appears on \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" that is probably one of the most interesting tracks because mix crime sound with shaolin.There are a lot of beautiful tracks,like \\"Wu-Gambinos\\",where the Clan become a crime family and every component of the group choose an alter-ego (for example Raekwon/Lou Diamonds,Method Man/Johnny Blaze etc.),\\"Wisdom Body\\",and this time GhostFace goes solo,\\"Heaven And Hell\\",from the \\"Fresh\\"Original Soundtrack... <br />Wu-Tang Saga continues...yes...Raekwon The Chef enter in the legend with a revolutionay album.  <br /> <br />EXCUSE ME BUT I MISS MY PASS SO I'LL REWRITE EVERY OLD REVIEW ;)
B000021Y74|5.0|Tom Tykwer's creative, avant-garde flick \\"Run Lola Run\\" is a hectic action fantasy filmed with some unusual cinematography in the streets of Berlin.  Using a formula as seen in Kurosawa's classic \\"Rashomon\\" the story postulates three possible plot scenarios, aided by some clever cartoon segments.<br /><br />The crux of the story involves Lola played by Franka Potente from \\"The Bourne Identity\\" and her boyfriend Manni played by Moritz Bleibtreu.  Manni, a low level criminal and certainly not the sharpest knife in the draw, is acting as a courier for 100,000 deutsch marks the proceeds from a deal.  Due to a foul up in plans he witlessly leaves the funds he is to deliver to a dangerous gangster on a subway where they are scooped up by a bum.  He desperately calls up Lola telling her that they must come up with the 100,000 within 20 minutes or he's dead meat.<br /><br />Lola implores him to wait, assuring him that she'll get the money. However Manni has rashly threatened to rob a large nearby supermarket to procure the money.<br /><br />The plot continues as we see Potente running wildly through Berlin attempting to get the dough.  Three separate possible scenarios play out as she rushes to her dad, who is a bank manager, to try and get the funds.  Fate has a large part in determining how each possibility will turn out.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Y'all know the Wu-Tang style:shaolin sworeds,kung fu films,rhymes and other oriental things.Real Wu fans know the style of every member of the Wu-Tang and everybady an confirm that GZA/Genius is the most...genial rapper in the group.The older phylosopher has got a legendary technique and a perfect metric,so everybody rate this man a Ney York Legend.Genius made,before \\"Liquid Swords\\",an unlucky LP called \\"Words From The Genius\\".The real oriental soul grow up with \\"Liquid Swords\\",the diamond of Wu-Tang solo discography with \\"No Said Date\\" of Masta Killa and Raekwon's\\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\". GZA spits on beats produced by another Killa Bee,The RZA Abbott. In almost every track you can find a Wu member,a lot of people say that this is a kind of reunion on a solo album.GZA's lirycs talk about many topics:Genius raps of the ghetto (Killa Hills 10304,story of a drug dealer),of music (Labels,a funny song where we can listen a lot of label's names),of corruption(Investigative Reports,track with a mafia flava,there is Raekwon and the co-chef GhostFace).GZA's second LP is a mix of styles and topics but you will find everytime that shaolin sound that is the Wu simobl.Great.If you haven't got this cd,move that mouse and click on GZA's \\"Liquid Swords\\". <br /> <br />EXCUSE ME BUT I MIS MY PASS SO I'LL REWERITE EVERY OLD REVIEW ;)
B00005JOGU|4.0|I haven't seen the movie, but have read \\"In Cold Blood\\" and several early reviews. All have been very praiseworthy. But I also was captivated by the sampling of the movie's soundtrack on the \\"Capote\\" Web site. The composer is Mychael Danna, who has scored several movies, including \\"Being Julia\\" and \\"Shattered Glass.\\" I could not find a soundtrack CD listing for \\"Capote\\" on Amazon. I e-mailed Danna on his Web site and asked about this. He said a soundtrack is not planned! Amazing! Does anyone have any reason why, besides economics?? I suspect we are missing out on a fine soundtrack CD!
B0002V7O3S|5.0|Fire in the Sky is one of the most memorable films of the nineties for me, It had it all, compelling characters, the right pacing for a thriller, and quite possibly the scariest conclusion one could hope for.<br /><br />  some of the things that makes this film great are the attention to the storyline, the acting, and without a doubt the creature effects, which will leave you absolutelly stunned that a film like this was made in the early part of the nineties, and the special effects look absolutelly real, where nowadays we get to see horribly executed CG creatures that , because of their cheapness become forgetable. Definetelly not the case here.<br /><br />  Another note, the film is suposedly based on a real story, and the story does pout forward arguments that leave the viewer wonderung weather it could have been possible, since it presents all the possible sides. Anyone who is looking for a film that will stay with you for long after you've watched it, then check this one out. THis is one of the highest possible recomendation i could give fans of sci-fi thrillers, or just horror in general.
0307276902|3.0|My reaction to this book is mixed. On the one hand, I will freely admit that while I was reading it, I couldn't put it down and when I wasn't reading it, I thought a lot about it. The story is certainly a compelling one. On the other hand, I was struck by how self-indulgent, and in some ways, self-congratulatory, it was. While the author honestly portrayed the sordid and criminal nature of his pre-rehab life, he also paints himself as this strong, fiercely independent hero who manages to kick addiction, and save the life of another addict, on sheer will alone. He's certainly inviting you to admire him while at the same time, insisting that he is despicable. As for the \\"style\\" of random capitalization, minimal punctuation and odd paragraphs, I found it to be more gimmicky than anything else, as if Frey is trying too hard to eschew convention. But I wasn't distracted by it after a few chapters.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was never able to catch firefly while it was on television, I look back at how horribly marketed the series was, while on its television run, and realise that i was never going to catch it. I was however intrigued when it got a dvd release two years ago, having been told that it was worth a check, i gambled it, and bought the set. It is possibly, my most treasured DVD now, and it sits within my top 5 must have DVDs.<br /><br />  Once you put the first episode on, and watch it, you will be enticed to sit and watch through all four discs, as each character created for this series works so well , chemistry-wise, and make such a remarcable world, that thrown together with the best special effects , incredible writting and highest production value i have seen on an television sci-fi series culminates on the apex of television series.<br /><br />  Some of the most quotable lines you will hear, laugh out loud moments, and incredible surprises, captain Mal's crew navigates firefights, sword duels, russian mobsters(in space), crazed space canibals, and many other surprises that will keep these characters on your memory for a long while after you watched this. I have also, since purchasing this set re-watched it three of four times, only proving the great re-watch value this set has.<br /><br />  Great moments includes Richard Brook's bounty hunter who is menacing as well as has a hearing problem, captain Mal's sudden wife who puts the ship in danger, the sword duel between mal and lor atherton, and so many other great situations.<br /><br />  I have forced many of my friends to buy this, and after watching it, they have always thanked me.
B000002AP1|4.0|This version has balls, It soudns the way I imagine the Stooges actually would sound in concert. The other version is interesting and cool in its own way, but for sheer agression and balls this is the one.
B00000IFWE|5.0|I've recently come back to this cd after not listening to it for awhile...my loss because this is one of the most consistent and mature rock albums Tom Petty ever made.  There are 3 gems on this that pu this over the top for me : Room At The Top, Swinging and Ome More Day, One More Night.  A great effort by the most consistent, tightest rock band around.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Ashes of the Wake is problably the best metal album to come out since Pantera's Great Southern Trendkill, which is saying a lot about how bad ass this album is. Almost every song is great, with only a couple not quite reaching a level of greatness (but even those few tracks are really good). Almost every song is really catchy and heavy at the same time. The lyrics are very cool and quite angry. The musicianship is great, Ashes is an incredible album, and much better than As the Palaces Burn (which is not a bad album by any means). If you are a fan of real metal, you will love this album.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|To start off I'm just going to say rhat SOAD should have added 2 extra songs because for a 35 minute album with only 10 songs makes me wonder why settle for 2 seperate albums with only 21 songs. Now to the album. It was 3 and half years since they last put out an original album and my opinion is that they did not dissapoint unlike other reviewers here i actually listened to the album and actually loved it. Rick Rubin, an extraordinary producer who has produced great rap and classic metal (Slayer's Reign in Blood) contributed his touches to SOAD's success over their career. Most of the songs here were written and sang by guitarrist Daron Malakian. Some songs I felt that maybe the lead singer Serj Tankian should have had more singing time because well, he's Serj, but the melodic harmony between both is just awesome just listen to Lost in Hollywood and hear why.Daron's guitar work was never better and Shavo's bass combines well with the guitars and drumming. Every track here has its own personality from silly, serious, crazy or calm but never ruins the tempo of the album. Songs deal with war, over indulgence and greed. Overall this is one great effort from a great band. P.S. buy both albums now because for $22.49 is the same price it was a double disc instead of single release.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Harsh and gritty with <br />Contrasts of light and color. <br />And that's just the film.
B00080Z53O|4.0|For those who like strong emotions and controversial issues, this movie is for you. It makes you wonder what you would do, if someone you love & care for, like a warm and funny uncle, is also totally immobilized and asks you to end his life. He can't. He cajoles you into it, and you try almost everything to let him retain hope. It's a soulful, graceful drama. You'll think about it long after. See it!
0671027344|5.0|I am 14 years old, and frankly, after reading this book, I started to question the way i live my life. Many people look at this book and see \\"MTV\\" and instantly say it is trash. This is my favorite book. Why? you ask, because it is the one I read last.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Q:  Brandon, tell us, how many times did you have to listen to the outrageously overhyped, overblown X&Y in its entirety before you ran across even one track that didn't make you wanna hurl?<br /><br />A:  Seven.  Ain't that pathetic?<br /><br />Q:  To what, then, do you attribute the runaway success of that record?<br /><br />A:  Oh, well, that's an easy one:  Chris Martin is probably the most nondescript, most boring platinum-selling frontman ever, and yet he has this disarming sort of aw-shucks arrogance that is hilarious and quite striking.  (Anybody catch their admittedly knockout \\"VH1 Storytellers\\"?  Or their Rolling Stone cover interview?  Anybody recall how bumfuzzled they were (and for that matter, ...I was) when \\"Clocks\\" nabbed Record of the Year at the 2004 Grammys?  These guys went out on a weekend fishing trip and hooked Jaws; they never set out to be the biggest band on the planet.)  The tandem is undeniably potent, especially since he has always preferred to let his (and his band's) music speak for itself (unlike, say, Mick or Bono).  This has all been well and good, but heretofore, so has been the music.<br /><br />Q:  That's pretty harsh, Brandon.<br /><br />A:  Harsh, hell!  Try achingly disappointing!  I literally had to keep reminding myself all summer long that I'm a fan of this band!<br /><br />Q:  So, seven times in, what was it about \\"Fix You\\" that finally grabbed you?<br /><br />A:  Well, look, lyrically, it's as turgid as most of their other material.  (The chorus pivots on the phrase \\"ignite your bones\\" and I swear I'm not making that up.)  But no one listens to Coldplay for their potent, probing prose; this is, after all, the band whose breakthrough (and very best song, natch), 2001's megahit \\"Yellow,\\" makes nary of lick of sense no matter how close you put your ear to the speaker.  But I don't know... once I let down my guard, it began to speak to me.  The song starts out as a ballad as mellow and meandering as all the other ballads that surround it, but just past the halfway point, the guitars start to swell and swirl, and the drums explode, and the cymbals crash, and suddenly it's this epic catharsis washing over your soul.  It's almost as if Martin had a pair of partials just laying around and decided to glue them together, just to see what would happen.  It doesn't deserve to work, but it does, and better than it ever should, and placed as it is in the dead center (literally) of a paralyzed album that sits there begging for a breakout, you gotta take what you can get.r ballads that surround it, but just past the halfway point, the guitars start to swell and swirl, and the drums explode, and the cymbals crash, and suddenly it's this epic catharsis washing over your soul.

B00006JDU9|1.0|I ordered the Star Wars I, II, & III and used the free shipping.  They were going to be all shipped together and it would hav free shipping.  I got an e-mail stating when they would be delivered and what the total charged to my debit card was ($46.95).  I got Star Wars I in the mail alone, so I got on the website to track my other 2 movies and it said there was a problem in shipping that they will be shipped soon.  That was fine because they are a Christmas gift and I didn't need them at the moment.  The problem is that I get on my internet banking and find that Amazon.com has charged me $11.39 s & h on just the one movie so instead of paying $14. something for each movie now since they had a problem and have to ship separatly I have to pay $26. something for each movie and they never bothered to contact me and let me know that.  I have tried to send them notes on the contact and help but they don't respond to any of them.  I have left my contact # and e-mail address and still no got nothing.  I order alot from them and I am now changing my mind and going to do business elsewhere.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is much like other futuristic Utopian society novels.  In fact, there are some parallels to 1984.  What 1984 lacks (more love, more positive emotion), however, The Giver more than possesses.  In a way, I suppose this could be 1984 from a child's myopic perspective.<br /><br />Jonas is a young boy who can't wait for his next birthday, the day he gets to find out about his future occupation.  All children are told what they will do for their occupation.  It's a society in which there are nearly no choices, no fear, no love, no feelings.  Along with that, unfortunately, is the fact that other simple pleasures and common knowledge is lost on the majority of society.  It will be Jonas' job to remember everything that the others do not have to remember, that which they can't even comprehend.<br /><br />The book reads quickly with very few lulls.  It's definitely a \\"can't put down\\" book.  In the end the reader is allowed to make a choice, to decide how the purposefully ambiguous ending is supposed to conclude.  It is up to each reader to determine whether or not the tale is sad and gloomy, or happy and optimistic.<br /><br />The Giver is a wonderful story for nearly all ages.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I really enjoy this CD for three reasons.  One, it is exactly the music I so much loved hearing on KCTV one evening, which is where I first heard about Celtic Woman.  Second, the harmony and voices are so skilled, clear and generally joyous.  Third, the instruments played are many, and give me a real sense of being there with everyone while they created the music.  Thank you!
0451169514|4.0|\\"It\\" was never a book I really wanted to read, I'd seen the mini-series and it didn't inspire the least bit of interest (quite the opposite actually). But then I read the Dark Tower, and when I was done I wanted to read the books that touched on the Tower. <br /> <br />The books is long, but I didn't want to put it down. It's the sort of book where you quickly get involved in the character's predicament and feel like you're the silent partner cheering them on in the wings, and you feel just a little bit sad when you have to say goodbye. <br /> <br />To sum it up: Under no circumstances should you decide whether or not to pick up the book by the quality of the mini-series (even if Tim Curry is the scariest clown you've ever seen), it doesn't do the book justice.
B00005JO0J|5.0|First, let me say that I missed Firefly when it first showed up on Fox. I found the dvd set and I absolute loved the story line, characters and universe. It's a kind of western in space, focusing on the bad guys. Except that the bad guys lost a war, fly in a space ship, shoot six-guns and are on the outer fringe of a great society. It doesn't take long to get into this and Whedon (Buffy and Angel television shows) does a great job with the characters and the stories. The characters are unique and very human. Each has their own backstory and motivations yet they seem very much like ordinary people. This is due to their individual talents as actors and Whedon's own skill in using his actors. <br /> <br />It's not at all necessary to watch the dvds to love the movie. There is just enough back story in the movie so that one can get caught up quickly and understand what drives the story. The movie still moves very fast and is a bit more complicated than all of the other big screen sci-fi movies that came out this year. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Firefly then this review won't be much more than a chorus of the praises you're already heard or sung yourself. If you haven't seen it, please do so. You'll see a greatly entertaining movie with a lot of action and humor and some sad bits, too. This movie just rocks and it shows exactly how every big budget action movie should contect with it's audience. It took a gang of misfits rescued from a cancelled television show to get it right. <br /> <br />
B000AARKOO|4.0|One might think Randall Wallace did the screenplay for Kingdom of Heaven.  After taking the flack for the multitude of blatant inaccuracies for Braveheart, he made the in-your-face statement that history should never get in the way of a good script.  Ridley Scott and William Monahan took that to heart!  Despite what the script calls for, blacksmiths didn't just up and become knights in the Middle Ages.  But that is a small sin, a foreboding of things to come.  The battle was not at Jerusalem, but a city known as Hattin (clue - it was called the Battle of Hattin for some reason...lol).  At one point in the movie, Saladin's sister is killed to tick him off - as if he isn't ticked enough already? ¯this didn't take place.  His sister was never killed.  Sigh.<br /><br />Before you can blink, you are knee-deep in stereotypical Christians.  We are treated with \\"cute\\" soundbites of the Kingdom of Heaven still being disputed, speeches that would have never been uttered during this period and an all too simple Hollywood style wrapped up ending.<br /><br />So, park any historical interest at the door.  Did you REALLY expect anything different from Hollywood?  The Costumes are wonderful, the lensing of the whole thing is stunning from start to finish.  Orlando is finally easing out of the teen mode and into manhood.  He looks good, though really needed to reach deeper than his Legolas mode to pull out this performance.  Still, I don't fault him for never delivering the knock out punch his character should have provided.  Blame first-time screen-writer William Monahan (maybe that is the mistake - big budget and they go with unproven talent?) should take twenty lashes for the sacrilege.  He just doesn't give Bloom much with which to emote.  The character of Balian is just so vacant.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable movie if you have no anticipations, love visual impact and are a Bloom fan.  I like it for what it is.  Will watch it more than once, as I do with Arthur.  Historical Fiction makes it so seldom to the movies, you cannot afford to<br /><br />be too picky.  As a lover of this period of history, I had foolishly hoped for more. It's a very good movie.  Not a great one that it should have been.<br /><br />Just wish it had a bit more of what it is not.ion makes it so seldom to the movies, you cannot afford to<br /><br />be too picky.

B00004XMV6|5.0|SPOILERS. There are many ways to \\"see\\"  \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\", from watching only the sex scenes to looking for \\"degrading to women\\" parts. The movie is a lot more than that. It shows Mickey Rourke as \\"John\\" in the only way available to him to feel and express love and desire. His lack of the full emotional range results in his needing highly controlled situations to get excited. He loves Elizabeth's beauty, but can't see-can't love HER, even though she is very lovable. He treats her like a pretty object.  He's so disconnected from his own feelings, he talks very little, always in a controlled way. He has no interest in what Elizabeth feels-only in how she reacts to the situations he sets up.    He observes her reactions closely with pleasure and amusement, like studying an insect under a microscope; he is a spectator rather than a participant. He cannot feel, and makes her feel instead, to see what it's like (\\"I saw myself in you\\" and \\"What does it feel like to be out of control!\\", he told her).    Elizabeth liked him  very much from the first moment she saw him. She thought this was a relationship like most others so she invites him to meet her friends. When he refuses, she submits-she likes him so much that she starts going along with HIS shaping of their relationship.   The little \\"normal\\" voice inside her speaks again, when she asks, \\"Aren't you interested whether I like the dress?\\", after he buys her clothes of his own choice. His answer is telling: \\"No, I'm not\\", spoken with a tender, beguiling, confusing smile, and soft, caressing voice, which-to her- belie the truth of his words. She just can't put together in her mind his tenderness, soft voice, polite manners, good looks, expensive gifts, breakfast in bed, \\"I want to take care of you\\", \\"I love you Elizabeth\\" with his actual indifference to her feelings,and his progressively humiliating and hurtful demands.   He even whispered \\"I love you\\" in her ear the moment before he went to open the door to the prostitute hehad arranged to visit them-you'll hear it if the volume is up.   She continues going along with his demands, trying to please him, until the moment comes when she realizes he will not give her any of the loving interest that his tender smile and soft voice promised  her at the beginning. She obviously has fallen in love with him, and as she walks away for the last time from his place, she turns her head back hopefully, crying, in case he has ran after her-still hoping for a real sign of love from him, in spite of her best sense that this guy is incapable of love as we know it. Just like most women would. Meanwhile, he stands frozen, close to tears, willing her to come back \\"...until I count to 50...\\", but unable to just open that door and catch her.  There were two things that the director used to tell us clearly that John was a control freak; shots of his closet with the evenly spaced hangers as if with a ruler and lots of identical shirts, pants, and coats and nothing else, and his desk drawer, with everything in its place, and a place for everything, chillingly neat. He was a man with a total need to control his environment (usually resulting from high anxiety).  Also, how he avoided personal involvement is shown in their first conversation at the Italian restaurant: Here he was sitting with a lovely, sexy woman who obviously likes him, and his conversation was not flirtacious, not about him, not about her, but the history of murders in the restaurant. Maybe only someone who has met a man with these outward signs and symptoms  can connect them to the huge emotional lack of his feelings.     And the much talked-about sexual scenes are vital to the story because that was ALL their interaction, there was no usual closeness and talks about each other's life, family, etc.The director makes that clear, showing us Elizabeth's attempt at sharing a funny tidbit about her dead uncle: John ends that attempt with his comment about his own Stock Exchange screens.    A very accurate psychological portrait of a highly attractive man unable to love, with a twisted attitude towards relationships, and a woman who is soft and hopeful for 9 1/2 weeks, before she leaves him when the pain  becomes too much.  It is so interesting to see that at no time does he question his behavior towards her-at no time does he apologize. He behaves as if it is the most natural thing to ask of her what he asks.  Only those who have known people like that will realize how correct the portrayal in the movie is-and I have.   Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger were superb in these highly nuanced roles, with award-meriting performances. \\"9 1/2 weeks\\" is a psychological drama of great depth and accuracy, told beautifuly on the screen.    02/05/06:  I read the book by Elizatheth McNeill,ISBN: 0060746394. I tried to find info. about her on the web, publishing house, etc. Nothing. There is another Elizabeth McNeill at Severn House Publishers, author of :  The Lady Of Cawnpore. Press Relations. Hot News. Unforgettable. The Last Cocktail Party. A Bombay Affair. The Golden Days.   So it is not the same Elizabeth McNeill who wrote \\"9 1/2 Weeks, the memoir of a love affair\\". That McNeill has vanished.  All I can say is that they should have made two movies: the one they made, and another one, with the same actors, true to the book, to be released later. The book is short, written in an amazingly personal, simple,raw way, which-having seen the film-brought it to life. It does not have one extraneous word in it. I can understand why they could not make the movie as the book  really was. The book was truly sadistic-she was tied to the leg of the table for example. The film, even though much milder than the book, succeeded very well in portraying John as the author lived him. The book does round out the experience, and the ending is very different than the film's. The book really cemented my opinion that this story did happen.
B000AL730O|4.0|First of all, let me state that I am a big Beatles / McCartney Fan. I have seen him in concert three times ('89, '93 and 2002) <br /> <br />I enjoy listening to this CD from begining to end (which is not always the case with McCartney albums/cd's). For all of the kuddos Flowers in the Dirt gets, I still can't tolerate 3 songs on the second part of the CD.  Anyway here goes my review of the songs: (when you listen to this CD, notice how each song ends in an unfamiliar way reminiscent of Abby Road...pay close  attention !) <br /> <br />A Fine Line: A nice opening song, a cousin to  Flaming Pie, good piano piece, missing a horn section and a Rusty guitar solo (third best song on this CD). <br /> <br />How Kind of You: Interesting song, great production work by Nigel, reminds me a bit of Somebody who cares (Tug of War). Musically it goes places McCartney doesn't normally visit. <br /> <br />Jenny Wren: McCartney visits a place we have been before, strong lyrics, grest production, McCartney on acoustic guitar. This song is a half brother to Blackbird and on par with Calico Skies off of Flaming Pie. I enjoy the vocals, this is an example where less is more..like a fine wine.. <br /> <br />At the Mercy: Really solid lyrics. Vocally this song goes places McCartney doesn't normally visit...and he isn't straining to get there....This song also benefits from great production work. The only thing missing on this song I think is guitar solo in the middle to be a classic...(2nd best song on this CD) <br /> <br />Friends To Go:  I've heard the stories about the George Harrison influence, I don't really hear it..sounds more like a Rubber Soul session (especially the backing vocals....)A nice song, strong middle, catchy melody...one of my favorites on the CD. Would fit in on just about any McCartney CD, by the way a great live version on AOL sessions...(video included) <br /> <br />English Tea: intro a bit like \\"For No One\\" (revolver), a nice piano piece, a song McCartney can writein his sleep. It probable is the most \\"Beatley\\" song  on the CD with nice production work and whispers  of When I'm 64 and Maxwell Silver Hammer ( John and George  would hate it !) But once the song enters your head...kinda hard to get rid of...I'm ambarassed to say...I LIKE IT...it's  bloddy McCartney.... <br /> <br />Too Much Rain: In my humble opinion the best song on this CD, great lyrics, instrumentation and production are first rate and some great vocals.....McCartney finally writes some heart felt lyrics that mean something (this song could be the soundtrack for the Hurrican Katrina victims) and will make it on some movie soundtrack sometime in the near future !! This song alone is worth the price of the CD alone...Listen to it with headphones and close your eyes....ENJOY <br /> <br />A Certain Softness:  Another one of the songs on this CD where less is more...very simple instrumentation and production.  It has a resemblance of some early Beatle songs (check on Beatles on the BBC). This song is easy on the ears and makes me wish I was in the studio with the 3 musicians, sitting in the corner with my drink and hanging with my girl... <br /> <br />Riding to Vanity Fair: Let me start with its one of my least favorite songs on this CD. Lyrics are okay, McCartney being coy about, who disappointed him...was it John, was it Denny was it his former manager...who knows....I barely care...it has a couple of interesting tidbits...would've made a better b-side.. <br /> <br />Follow Me: A nice little song (a quasi-spirtual hymm)...one of the few songs on the CD perfomed with his live band...a very Beatley middle eight...vocals are weak in parts....another one of those songs McCartney can write in his sleep...I've heard relatives  of this song on both Driving Rain
B00005JODA|5.0|For years John le Carre has be turning out splendid spy novels, some better than others, but he can be counted on to hit on a plot line that draws us in and spins us around in an absorbing and entertaining way.  I read the novel before seeing the film, and I'm glad I did:  I highly recommend this order:  book first, film second.  What makes the movie so successful is that Meirelles lets the story tell itself without forcing it along.  It is not strictly a linear approach, since there are a number of flashbacks, but I didn't feel any sense of contrivance on the part of the filmmaker. <br /> <br />Fiennes is solid as the title character, a Englishman thru and thru, more wedded to his plants and to his job as a mid-level diplomat than to his vibrant and headstrong young wife, played with great passion by Rachel Weisz, an actress with wonderful smarts ( we know that she's as clever as any man in the cast from the moment we hear her in conversation ). <br /> <br />Africa is a hotbed of conflict, whether it be the political turmoil in this country of that, or the rampant diseases that are ravaging families, or the famines that kill as many children as the epidemics, or the soulless profiteering by global consortiums.  Le Carre uses the greed of a particular drug company and the victimization of hapless African TB sufferers as the springboard for his drama, and it makes for good cinema.  We love the underdogs; we chafe at the way the Bad British Bureaucrats are covering up for the drug companies; we want justice, justice and more justice. <br /> <br />And, fortunately, Mierelles gives us realism, unapologetic and unsentimental.  This is why the film succeeds.  There are very few Rocky Balboas when it comes down to it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Loved the movies, hope they come back as a new series and will go see the movie serinity ASAP
B000002LVB|5.0|Admittedly, this album is not there best but definitely worth listening too. <br /> <br />1. Who Loves the Sun - 4/5 - Your basic break up song and hey it's a lot better than most of the lyrical content about break ups used today. <br /> <br />2. Sweet Jane - 4.5/5 - I have to admit this song is very poor vocally but it's a catchy tune with quirky lyrics that make you want to think of some thing nostalgic from the '70's. <br /> <br />3. Rock And Roll - 5/5 - definitely a reason to listen to this album, good lyrics and instrumental performances. <br /> <br />4. Cool It Down - 3.5/5 - as it was said, mediocre. <br /> <br />5 - 7 - Seems more like filler songs, not really worth rating you either love them or hate them. <br /> <br />8. Oh Sweet Nuthin! - 5/5 - Like Rock and Roll this one&#8217;s a great.
B000001FZK|5.0|This album simply blows me away. I pretty much have gooseflesh all the way thorough. I loved it the day it was released, and everytime I listen to it, I can't believe that it is possible to love it any more than I do, but the next time, I do love it even more.
0300108834|5.0|Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
0321213351|3.0|Design pattern concepts can be rather abstract at times, and the absence of code samples can make some of these concepts even harder to visualize. In this book, the author does an excellent job of applying design pattern concepts to code refactoring, thereby helping illustrate such an abstract subject. The contents of the book are thoughtfully structured such that the reader can focus on a specific pattern or specific refactoring problem,instead of reading through the chapters sequentially. I found the UML diagrams especially helpful, since they clearly delineated the design before and after, refactoring. However, the book falls short in terms of utilizing some of the coding samples, as the author tries to step though each code sample and loses the reader in the process. These exercises would have been a lot more fruitful and lucid had there been source code for the designs, before and after refactoring. <br /> <br />
B000001EAQ|3.0|\\"Pop\\" was the third album in U2's reinvention trilogy (following \\"Acthung Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa\\"), before they finally came to the realization that being U2 was just fine without all the bending and twisting. Coming also at the lowest point in Bono's exasperating \\"I'm just a plastic pop star\\" phase, it means that moment-identifying production completely buries some amazing songs here.<br /><br />Like David Bowie's \\"Earthling,\\" released roughly the same period as \\"Pop,\\" U2 drenched their album with the current drum'n'bass dance electronica that was sweeping England at the time. Not like U2 hadn't already dabbled in electronics (think \\"Zooropa\\"), but this time they took songs that would probably have stood better without the computerized bleeping and forced a date stamp that screams \\"1997!\\" Case in Point; \\"If God Will Send His Angels.\\" In the kind of lost lover lament and religious intertwine that spans U2's best songs, \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" begs for an acoustic treatment (and got one on the soundtrack to \\"City Of Angels\\"), but instead burbles along on \\"Pop's\\" machine generated drone.<br /><br />Needless to say, if it weren't for the fact that \\"Pop\\" contains such brilliant work as \\"Last Night On Earth,\\" \\"Staring At The Sun\\" \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" and \\"Angels,\\" the overbearing production would have crushed a lesser band. In fact, even the silly \\"Discotheque\\" (again with the wink-wink nudge-nudge video that accompanied it) proved that the band could loosen up and show a sense of humor.<br /><br />So while I would not call this essential U2, I'll probably never dismiss it from my Cd rack. And since they redeemed themselves as rockers with the next album, it's easy to forgive U2 their desire to push at their \\"Pop\\"-velope.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Limp Bizkit made their reputation through hard work, touring the hell out of their debut album Three Dollar Bill Y'All and thereby elevating themselves to the popularity status of their similarly rap-inflected, alt-metal mentors Korn. with their second album, Significant Other, they come close to reaching Korn's artistic level; at the very least, it's considerably more ambitious and multi-dimensional than Three Dollar Bill. Limp Bizkit, of course, hasn't abandoned their testosterone-overloaded signature sound, they've just built around it. there are flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers and there are swirls of strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background. all of it simply enhances the force of their rap-metal attack, which can get a little tedious if it's unadorned. not so coincidentally, the enlarged sonic palette also serves as emotional coloring for Fred Durst's lyrics. he broke up with his longtime girlfriend -- his Significant Other, if you will -- during the writing of the album, and his anguish is apparent throughout the record, as almost every song is infused with the guilt, anger, and regret that was churned up in the wake of separation. that, however, gives the impression that this is an alt-metal Blood on the Tracks. it's not. nevertheless, it does have more emotional weight than Three Dollar Bill, along with more effective, adventurous music. more importantly, it balances these new concerns with trace elements of their juvenile humor along with the overpowering aggro rap-metal that is their stock in trade. which makes it a rare artistic leap forward that will still please audiences that just want more of the same.
B000000HHE|5.0|I cannot help but think back to those days of 1987-88.  De La Soul was unlike anything in the world of hip hop.  The first time I heard Jennifer o Jenny, was amazing.  Here were some MC's who sampled old/odd music/bits and created their own slang.  Not much out there today resembles what De La did during this time.  Maybe Outcast.  Maybe.  The musical direction of Prince Paul is evident.  Maybe I am getting old, but I wish hip hop was like this today.  Creative, unique, smart, hip, fun, and BRILLIANT.  What happened to Hip Hop?  Perhaps this is the greatest Hip Hop album of all time.
0385512104|5.0|This tender and well written novel is an amazing study in character development and narration.  Young Christopher relates a chapter in the story of his family's life through the prism of his autistic eyes. Yet this is done without a hint of condescension or scrap of pity by author Mark Haddon.<br /><br />Christopher finds his neighbor Mrs. Shear's standard poodle Wellington  dead in the front yard, impaled by a garden fork. As he sets about \\"detecting\\" the solution to this vicious murder, he finds instead threads of evidence that lead to the revelation of a terrible family secret; one that sends him on a quest he never thought himself capable of conducting.<br /><br />Christopher views things differently than the majority of us, and reduces most situations to mathematical formulae. One is left realizing that there is more than one way to view things, and perhaps Christopher is able to deal with his life better than many of us. His articulation of society's maxims are humorous yet spot on, e.g. \\" People say that you always have to tell the truth. But they do not mean this because you are not allowed to tell old people that they are old and you are not allowed to tell people if they smell funny, or if a grown up has made a fart. And you are not allowed to say `I don't like you' unless that person has been horrible to you.\\"<br /><br />This novel is most certainly a landmark work.  It will be interesting to see if someone ventures to make it into a film; that would be a terrific challenge, but perhaps one that Mr. Haddon is exploring.
B00005JL78|4.0|You will see things in this movie you have never seem before. The action is done in new and interesting ways. The plot is interesting (especially for what is really an action flick) and will keep you involved all the way through.<br /><br />All of the actors give very good performances and though the special effects are quite amazing they are used in the service of the story. One little example is the animated cereal box that irritates Anderton (Tom Cruise) so he chucks it across the room. The point is on Anderton not the box even though that effect is interesting. There are many many many effects like that in this movie.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the movie a great deal there were a couple or three scenes that caused me real discomfort. I think (and feel free to disagree with me on this) that some things in this movie aren't for people under sixteen even though it is rated PG-13 it does have some sexual scenes that while not overt would make me uncomfortable with my 14 year old with me.<br /><br />I liked the movie enough to want it to be a big success, but not enough to tell my kids to go see it. I think it is a better movie that \\"Sum of All Fears\\" which I also liked, but I would rather my kids saw that movie. This movie is an action movie, but has enough of a point to almost be a serious piece - it really is that interesting. However, it pulls back from a serious examination of the points it raises - but that isn't the point of this movie, is it?<br /><br />It IS really an action movie, so let's not begrudge it its true nature. Don't get too bent out of shape at the gaps in the logic of the plot. As in all noir films, there is FUN to be had in all the movie misery and pain (which woludn't be fun in real life).<br /><br />But if you love an involved and interesting story, and relish seeing things you haven't seen before this is a good movie for you. Just beware of that it will be a rough ride at a couple of spots along the way.
1892005034|5.0|This book was recommended to me by several friends in healing professions, and also by a business litigation accountant.  Having a great deal of respect for these people I decided to give it a try. <br /> <br />To me the book is about elements of threat, judgementalism or violence that are unintentionally included in the language that we speak and hear, and think.  The book suggests that by clearly separating factual observations, feelings, needs, and the resulting requests, acknowledging vulnerable feelings and needs, and using listening tools, we can defuse confrontations, become more effective communicators, and become more at peace with others and with ourselves. <br /> <br />My speaking and thinking patterns are deeply entrenched over many years, and I expect that it may take at least a few passes through reading and applying the book before I see many benefits, but I am impressed with this book and think that the potential benefits are worth the investment of time.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|As any Death Cab for Cutie fan (pre-\\"O.C.\\" appearance) I had been anticipating the band's newest release, Plans, with high expectations. I was weary due to its first major-label release (Atlantic). Here, I'll explain my semi-disappointment.  The album clocks in at 44 minutes, which although about the same length as its well-received 2003 album, Transatlanticism (Barsuk), feels strangely short. I hear the potential for percussion wanderings in \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed;\\" and \\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\" suddenly morphs into a Postal Service-like rendition of itself while I would rather hear the first part, a crackly old-timey piano tune, embellished on.   Having known this band's full ability to take a song somewhere you never thought it would go - it took me at least a few listens to wrap my head around the melded group of \\"Tiny Vessels,\\" \\"Transatlanticism,\\" and Passenger Seat;\\" feeling as if they could be chapters in a monumental flow-of-consciousness book - I am left to wonder why Death Cab didn't push many of the songs on Plans further. The un-blossoming \\"Your Heart is an Empty Room,\\" \\"Someday You Will Be Loved,\\" and \\"Stable Song\\" (which was previously called \\"Stability\\" on The Stability EP and lasted over 12 minutes) sit mostly half-ready, maybe hastily written.  The high points of the album come when Ben Gibbard's lyricism and the band's song crafting meet: on \\"What Sarah Said,\\" Gibbard repeats in a half-cry, half-whine, \\"so who's gonna watch you die?\\", and on \\"Summer Skin,\\"  he simply states, \\"then Labor Day came and went, and we shed what was left of our summer skin.\\"  \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" is a possibly perfect song in any music snob's book, but the saddest part is not the haunting lyrics of death; rather, it's that this is a Ben Gibbard song (vocals+acoustic guitar), not Death Cab for Cutie. It only makes me more interested to check out his split solo EP (with Andrew Kenny).     I can't say this album is bad; it has catchy hooks and all that. But I can say it's disjointed, and a bit lackluster. I guess I'll wait for another side project to come out, to find other pieces of the Death Cab I used to know.
B00005JLKN|4.0|In the wake of \\"Hannibal\\", there was much to fear about how \\"Red Dragon\\" would turn out.  First of all, film fanatics would have familiarized themselves with Michael Mann's \\"Manhunter\\" and the franchise lost much of its following from the second installment.  This time around, Universal decided to use Hopkins again as its Hannibal Lecter anchor (although I can't imagine anyone else playing the role) and have the talented Edward Norton fill the shoes of Will Graham.  They also integrated Harvey Keitel as FBI agent Jack Crawford and finished the strong cast with the killer being played by none other than Ralph Fiennes.  Using Ralph Fiennes takes the tale in a different direction than \\"Manhunter\\" or even the novel may have envisioned, but I loved the idea.  Ultimately we're rewarded with a return to the classic style we all fell in love with more than ten years ago. <br /> <br />The story is simple.  Our scene opens before \\"Silence\\" as agent Will Graham (Norton) arrests Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter (Hopkins) as the result of a slew of serial killings all leading back to one place.  After the near death experience of capturing him, and the subsequent media attention, Graham retires.  Now there is a new killer, nicknamed \\"Tooth Fairy\\" who is slaughtering families in very gruesome ways.  Graham's former boss, Jack Crawford (Keitel) convinces him to take one yet another case and try to figure out the killer.  When Graham is forced to consult Lecter, who is also being contacted by \\"Tooth Fairy\\", he finds himself stuck between capturing a killer and saving himself. <br /> <br />The performances were incredible, each character in the film bringing the novel to life and thankfully in a different way than the previous version (Manhunter).  The style is so common to \\"Silence\\" that I had to double check and make sure the movie wasn't directed by Jonathan Demme, but it turned out to be directed by Brett Ratner who hasn't done anything spellbinding up to this point.  The film isconcise and the plot is driven with intense scenes, powerful acting, and feels like you're there with the characters.  This installment does not dissappoint, unless you've read the novel and expected Hollywood to actually stay with the original ending. <br /> <br />The film is sharp and clear and the soundtrack clean, the Dolby 5.1 will give you a sense of being in danger the whole time.  The special features aren't the best, but better than most DVDs on the market.  Instead of some boring featurette that's really a fifteen minute commercial for the movie we finally get insight and specials revolving around defining Hannibal Lecter.  Although having nothing to do with the actual movie, it is interesting and much better than the random crappy deleted scenes of normal movies.  Any fan of the series will find the extras quite rewarding and it really completes the package of this great film.
B00002E233|5.0|Why people slate this film I dont know.They either no nothing abotu a good film or are just messing around, this is a really fun exciting film, it isn't scary or emotional even when somebody gets chopped up by the shark but it all adds up to great fun. I mean that crazy woman with the brown hair shouldn't have let that shark go,I was urging for the shark to gobble her up! Anyway, Thomas jane excells in this film. He is outstanding. Him and LL Cool J are the only characters you really care for and oh , that guy with the brown hair. He goes udner water and sees a head floating about or something and rises andshouts \\" what the f**k \\" in a weird voice. I think it is really funny. Anybody who likes a fun film with plenty action non-stop dont lsiten to the others and listen to me, this film is great! <br /> <br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope it helps in your choice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the series without knowing a thing about it because it was selling in the top 50 with 1700 reviews averaging 5 stars. I'm adding another 5; joining the cult!  <br /> <br />A beautifully conceived storytelling treat, in book terms a page turner. Complex likeable characters, the women so physically *gorgeous* that the eye was pleased no matter what else was happening; the tension and the shocks and the ruthlessness and swashbuckling adventure-tales with brilliant 'taken for granted' high tech moments which didn't drown you in their 'cleverness'. <br /> <br />I am sure this will be revisited for countless years by so many who will see it as a classic, just as now I am enjoying watching the Kung Fu series from the 70s. Owning DVDs is like owning good books; you can collect a library of your favourites.  <br /> <br />Watching the special features cheered me up some. I had read so often how this was a 'failed' series pulled by the network and I assumed that the the creators may have been feeling low down and discouraged, but it seems to be not the case. Everyone associated with it knew it was brilliant and it was interesting that perhaps because the series was under stress, it may have influenced its edgey punchiness for the better. <br /> <br />Has it won any awards? Yes? No? Me ... I'd give it the Hugo, the Nebula, the John Wayne, the Bruce Willis, the Hugh Hefner, the Kill Bill ...
B00082IJ08|5.0|I have to say, this album FAR exceded my expectation!  I recieved it as a gift from a person who knew i was a fan of the first Gorillaz album and I have not stopped listening to it since.  I am a person who buys new records frequently and this has become one of those rare buys that make you long for a free moment in your day just so you can listen to a few songs.  I find it FAR better than the first album they released and have also become convinced that every project Damon Albarn is involved with somehow turns to gold. Totally fantastic, i recommend very highly.
B00004Y6NM|5.0|I agree that this is an underrated Clapton Album. Produced by Phil Collins, it boasts one of the best guitar solos (his guitar rocks and roars above a blues standard backing) I have heard from Clapton captured in the studio since his Cream and Derek and the Dominoes days. (Before his laid back, easy listening persona took hold) The song is a Clapton penned one called 'Same Old Blues' Indeed, if it were up to me, I would recommend the album just for that track, 'She's Waiting' (One of his strongest, emotionally charged songs since 'Layla')and the Jerry Lynn Williams song that became a hit for him and helped rejuvenate his career, 'Forever Man'. Note, The remastered version reduces the analog hiss, strengthens and brightens the overall sound of the album but the original analog transfer is just fine if you are concerned about cost.
B000000XB9|5.0|CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL-CHRONICLE: Show me a cat who grew up in the seventies who doesn't own a copy of this anthology (and still plays it), and I'll show you a cat who also doesn't like brewskis, the THREE STOOGES and America...in other words, I don't trust 'im. This stands as one of the ten GREATEST \\"greatest hits\\" collections ever asembled; head yowler/guitar slinger/songwriter JOHN FOGERTY and company covered all the touchstones of rock and roll, from bloozey country to wailin' soul, and did it bigger and better than anyone else. Charismatic, gritty, spooky and sentimental, CCR effortlessly channeled old timey ditties DOWN ON THE CORNER and TRAVELIN' BAND, psychedelic swampers RUN THROUGH THE JUNGLE and GREEN RIVER, take-no-prisoner rock ravers UP AROUND THE BEND and SWEET HITCH-HIKER...and had double sided hit singles with practically everything they touched. CHRONICLE serves up twenty tracks of titillating, triumphant twang, missing only quagmire classic BORN ON A BAYOU, one of their most vital singles...a good excuse to pick up CHRONICLE VOL. 2, their near equal sequel.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE PLAID SHIRTS
B000002UA0|5.0|The sad thing about this album is that a lot of people haven't heard it. I don't even see it at the local music stores. To most people, Pink Floyd are the guys that made \\"Money,\\" \\"Another Brick in the Wall, part 2\\" and did those Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland tricks. There's almost no mention of songs from this album, and Syd Barrett is just a nobody. This album is the beginning of Pink Floyd and also contributes to the psychadelic rage of the late '60s. But for those that worship \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and probably want to give this album a shot, I caution you. This is NOT another \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" You may be turned off by the (as another reviewer put it) \\"poppy\\" sounds here. It's kinda like listening to a trippier version of the Beatles. But like the Beatles, the lyrics here are uplifting and perhaps even humorous. Syd Barrett's lyrics somewhat resemble a children's book (it probably should be since the album title was taken from his favorite childhood book The Wind in the Willows). But Pink Floyd also adds a dark side to this album with their trippy instrumental numbers like the trippy and haunting epic \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\" Pink Floyd brought darkness unlike any other band that released an album in 1967. The noise rock sound resembles what the Velvet Underground did. As I've read somewhere, Pink Floyd were once an underground band. Maybe that's why this album doesn't receive the recognition it deserves. But by all means, listen to this album. Order it on eBay, download it (either the right or wrong way), go to your local music store and have them order it for you, do whatever it takes. If you don't like it, well... at least you've heard the band as they once were with their former frontman Syd Barrett before drugs brought him to his downfall. \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is the best psychadelic rock album that is not \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" But upon hearing this album, you may wonder: What would the band have been like if Syd hadn't gone nuts? Would have they made a \\"Dark Side of the Moon?\\" The album just makes us wonder, and that's the beauty of it.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years oldyd hadn't gone nuts?

B000002UCN|3.0|GEORGE HARRISON-THE BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON: It's hard to fathom why an event as tragic as George Harrison's death still hasn't produced a decent career-spanning retrospective in his honor. This &#34;half 'n half&#34; mix of admittedly important Beatles bits like SOMETHING, TAXMAN and WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS plus stellar introspective solo smashes WHAT IS LIFE, MY SWEET LORD and GIVE ME LOVE (GIVE ME PEACE ON EARTH) certainly seemed vital at the time of its mid seventies release...but the RODNEY DANGERFIELD of rock and roll deserves a worthy update. 2009's LET IT ROLL: THE BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON comes up woefully short, ignoring delicious cult classics like WAH-WAH, DING DONG DING DONG, CRACKERBOX PALACE and his exuberant TRAVELING WILBURYS material. HARRISON, noted for his fluid, melodic guitar work, warm, earthy vocals, and spiritual world view, has never truly been given his due...say, a spectacular box set brimming with ALL the classics as well as a smattering of live tracks, outtakes and rarities. Even RINGO has been treated a helluva lot better than this.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR QUIET ONES
0380778556|5.0|This was one of those books I will never forget.  It was actually required summer reading for my freshman year of high school, it was the first I read for my high school career.  I was the perfect age for that, age 14, hanging just between that childhood - womanhood age and about to progress from childhood to adulthood.  Maybe that's why this grabbed me so hard.<br /><br />The narrator, whose name we will never learn and will only know as the second Mrs. De Winter, takes us on a mysterious, gothic tale of love and lies.  A handsome stranger has come to Monte Carlo where he meets a loud, borish woman named Mrs. Van Hopper and her traveling companion, the narrator.  The narrator is a shy, churchmouse of a girl just barely out of her teens who falls for this dashing man, Maxim De Winter.  It's natural for her to have sort of a school girl crush on someone like him, for sure, and he takes her out and entertains her while in Monte Carlo.  When Mrs. Van Hopper decides to move on, Maxim surprises everyone by asking the narrator to marry him.  Maybe more surprising, she accepts and suddenly she goes from being a poor tagalong paid companion to being the wife of a wealthy English countryman.<br /><br />While it begins as a Cinderella story, the second Mrs. De Winter finds herself in a Cinderella dilemma: what to do now?  While she is suddenly introduced to a new way of life, she is unsure and has natural apprehension how to act and how to present herself to others.  Part of it is that she is very young, had been sheltered and put to the side, and doesn't know how to be rich while Maxim is much older, more experienced, and is very rich.  She is nervous and insecure, which speaks to the reader very much of being afraid and trying to cope with change.  Plus, she cannot escape his first wife, the beautiful, talented, charming Rebecca whose reputation preceeds everything.  Now, we are in her home, Manderly, which has become a haunted house of sorts.  The second Mrs. De Winter isgrowing more and more insecure everyday, feeling that she is always being compaired to Rebecca wherever she goes and is uneasy.<br /><br />The one who is compairing her the most with Rebecca is Mrs. Danvers, Manderly's housekeeper.  She isn't just stiff, she is formidable.  She barely conceals her distain for the new mistress of the house, as she absolutely adored Rebecca and will never let her memory die.  Around the house, the second Mrs. De Winter finds things with the signature R (stationary, towels, etc.) that under Mrs. Danvers's orders were not removed.  When the second Mrs. De Winter finds Rebecca's old room, it has not been shut down but has been kept as if she had just left and is awaiting her return.  Even though she has been dead for over a year, drowned off the coast of Manderly.<br /><br />This book haunts us but so many things speak to us in it.  The feelings of insecurity, being haunted by ghosts from the past (those alive and dead), finding out things are not what they seem to be.  Rebecca, as it turns out, was certainly beautiful and beloved by all who knew her, but Maxim reveals that he hated her and their marriage was a front.  Rebecca was actually rotten, evil, self serving, and unfaithful.  Maxim is just as ashamed that he put up the front of a happy marriage when she was off cavorting and cheating on him in London.  Secrets and lies keep it juicy enough to keep us interested.  The formerly scary Mrs. Danvers keeping of her memory alive shows us not of her evil nature, but of her pathetic one.  All these things make the second Mrs. De Winter grow up, and she becomes The Rock when she realizes that she no longer has to compete with a lie.  And though she might have doubted it before, Maxim really does love her because he never loved Rebecca.  Enjoy this for all the juicy secrets and lies.
1577314808|4.0|While my overall experience of this book is very positive, I also found it to be a little bit like the writings of Karl Marx: its insights are brilliant but its recommendations are dogmatic and potentially harmful. Let me explain.    As its title suggests, the core message in \\"The Power of Now\\" is that we derive our greatest strength and sense of peace from the present moment. For me, and I believe for Tolle, the present moment is simply awareness. In terms of our relationship to the external environment, this means allowing ourselves to see what is around us instead of labeling and dismissing these things. For example, this can mean stopping to see a tree without expectation or judgment and with the full awareness of our internal urge to limit what we are seeing as just a tree. In terms of our relationship to our own thoughts and feelings the present is also about observation, about allowing whatever comes up internally to be. When resistance, judgments, or stories come up, observe them. When you observe these things instead of renouncing them or letting them control you, this is a form of accepting them as they are and therefore of accepting yourself as you are. As a result you are an integrated (and therefore grounded, powerful) human being instead of a fragmented one. Negative forces such as self-loathing, fear, grief, and anger continue to come up (they always will) but since they are named and observed they diminish in intensity. So within this context, I agree with Tolle about the power and importance of the present moment. Where I disagree with Tolle and where I feel his book has the potential to cause harm is in his rejection of the past and his rejection of what he calls the pain body.      I disagree with him about the past because it often contains unreleased trauma that directly impacts our life in the present moment. We may find for example that we have severe judgments about ourselves and other people, or that we have volatile mood swings and we may not know why. By accessing and then releasing past trauma we have a better shot at living the present moment as it is, instead of how it is distorted by our defenses, moods, and judgments, almost all of which are the result of early childhood conditioning. If you accept Tolle's approach, the past goes unexamined because it doesn't count. But you are the past and the more you know that past-I mean truly know who you are instead of your stories about who you are-the greater your possibility of having an authentic experience in the present moment.     I also disagree with Tolle's rejection of the mental and emotional anguish that he feels are contained in what he terms \\"the pain body\\". We almost always manifest emotional anguish in order to teach ourselves something about who we are and what we need. Once we learn the lesson, the emotional anguish tends to diminish. Sure, it's still there but it no longer has its hold over us. But if we follow Tolle's advise about rejecting feelings such a loneliness, fear, rage, jealousy, helplessness, or grief for the sake of being in the present moment, then we also reject what these things have to teach us. From my own experience, reading, and counseling, I've come to see these dark emotions as friends and teachers. Accepting them is a frightening and counter-intuitive process but it does provide us with the way in to discovering who we really are. Rejecting them subverts that process and sets us up for more confusion and agony.    Incidentally, Tolle is correct in linking emotional trauma to the physical body. We do store our emotions physically which means that we can trigger them by accessing the parts of the body where they are stored. It also means that we can improve our physical health by releasing trauma.    By all means read this book and take time to absorb and reabsorb its marvelous insights. But please don't just accept Tolle's insights as gospel-TEST THEM. Test his insights against your own feelings and experience and information you acquire from other sources. If you find yourself worshipping the guru then you know that something has gone wrong somewhere. I have to admit I do detect a subtle but powerful strain of egotism, in Tolle's writing and fear that weak and gullible readers may come to worship him. Remember that as Tolle himself points out, he is just a pointer to truths that are already inside us.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is the most accurate to the novel.  Although there are a few scenes/dialogues added or removed, the essentials remain intact.  The acting is phenomenol and truly brings the characters right off the page, the scenery provides the perfect backdrop, and everything flows much like Jane Austen must have envisioned. <br /> <br />This movie is a must-see for any Pride and Prejudice/Jane Austen enthusiast or for anyone who deeply loves a true romantic comedy.
0596007124|5.0|One thing is for sure, when you pass this book in the store it will catch your attention (at least if your a male that is still breathing), however that is no way to judge a technical book. Checking out the back cover reveals a very different story - both Erich Gamma and Ward Cunningham appear to love the book, and what higher authority is there on Design Patterns?  Anyway, it was enough to make me pick up the book. Inside you're going to find something very different from a computer text. What you're going to find is a completely different format created by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates that uses conversation, graphic treatment, and even puzzles to help you learn. The book has more the appearance of, say, a graphic novel than your typical O'Reilly book. It also in places is quite funny in a \\"wink wink\\" techie way. <br /> <br />But can you learn from this or is it just a lightweight cartoon guide to design patterns? Actually, this is where I was surprised.  This book takes design patterns very seriously, and on quite a few patterns it straightened up my view of them, and in a couple places totally changed what I thought the pattern was (the factory pattern is a good example).  It also does something better than any other patterns book I've read, it links design patterns to the design principles they are based on. I have been exposed to all the principles, but I can't say I'd ever put together the big picture, and this book helped me do that. <br /> <br />I think best of all, this book is very approachable for intermediate programmers that know a little object oriented programming but are ready to really start thinking about objects. That doesn't describe me, but I wished I'd had this book a few years back when I was learning. <br /> <br />In sum, if you have an open mind and are looking for an excellent source of OO and Design Patterns material, and don't actually mind having your brain tickled while you learn, then this format really works.  I'm looking forward to more of these kinds of books (I've also read the Servlets book in the series).
B00006JDU9|3.0|Star Wars is great entertainment, but this one is kinda wimpy.  There are great parts of course, like the pod race and Obi Wan vs. Darth Maul, but other than that Jar Jar ruins it.  So do the rest of the Gungans for that matter.  I find myself wanting to fast forward through like half of this film.  I dunno, pretty cool, but NOTHING compared to II and III.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Give it a while,  trust me it will grow on you.   <br /> <br />My cousin told me how good this album was for like a year and a half and I'd heard some of it off and on in that time and I really didn't like it, I didn't get it, I didn't want to get it, it was too \\"out there\\" for me, the songs didn't make sense to me at all, I couldn't tell where they were going with these songs and I didn't really care for the vocals at all either. <br /> <br />Some reason I decided to pick it up a few months ago, I listened to it a couple times,  this time it was alright there was a couple cool parts,  but still nothing I could get into. about a month later I got stuck with just that CD in my car for a few days while I was moving,  and I listened to it over and over again (which I normaly never do),  but every time I listened to it, it got better. after like the third time around it finally clicked, The music made sense, I liked the vocals,   and I realized just how genius this album was, and I couldn't stop listening to it. Turns out my cousin didn't like it when he first heard it either, so I don't know if its just us or if this album just takes time to grow on you. <br />A lot of the best ablums I've heard have taken a while to grow on me.  This is a really great album from start to finish. <br />I would highly recommend it,  and if you don't like it the first time,  keep listening to it, it'll be worth it,  trust me. <br /> <br />my favorite tracks are. 1,2,6,7,8.  They all have weird names so I'll just put the numbers. <br />Tracks 2 and 6 are just amazing songs, I never get tired of them. <br /> <br />NOTE: There is not a bad song on this album. <br />
B000002KLG|5.0|This CD is definitely one to own. Jazz and R&B fans alike will highly agree that this work is possibly George's finest, and with the backing of Quincy Jones, how could you go wrong? Every tune here is remarkable, ranging from dreamy tunes for those in the mood to wonderful, smooth dance tunes for those who want to get on the floor. Featuring the writings of Rod Temperton, a frequent collaberator with Quincy, as well as the backings of the great Greg Phillinganes, Paulinho DaCosta, Patti Austin, Jim Gilstrap, Tom Bahler (the list goes on), this CD is one of the finest R&B releases of the 1980s, if not of all time.
0156027321|5.0|I was so entranced by this exquisite read that I had to read it aloud to my three teenaged daughters, ages 16, 14 & 13. I let them look often at the cover, which clearly states that \\"Life of Pi\\" is fiction. Even in the 3rd section of the book, which offers an alternative tale to the one just read, they were willing only to BELIEVE in the first version of \\"Pi's\\" tale. I shared that feeling. I loved the idea that this had really happened and that a young man's faith sustained him through unimaginable pain and suffering. I learned a lot about how others have truly survived at sea. I learned a fair amount about religions foreign to my own. I learned without feeling I was being taught.<br /><br />This was a gripping novel. \\"Page turner\\" is an overused compliment, but I literally had to insist on stopping as I read it aloud to my girls. You are just compelled to continue. I cannot think of a category of humans who would NOT enjoy this book. I am handing it off to my 18 year old son next. I would confidently recommend it as a gift, even if you have not read it yourself. This will be on my top 10 list of favorite books for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read it. Then do someone you love a favor and have THEM read it.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie is totally funny, I liked it a lot, these guys really did a very good job with these puppets...their moves and expressions are really funny...I recommend it highly,only if you are a fan of South Park and its kind of humor they use...NOT for kids.
B000003C4K|5.0|This is easily the best Exodus album and one of the best thrash albums ever.The riffs are awesome,the songs are catchy,and the drumming is awesome!Here is a track by track review: <br />1.Bonded By Blood-5/5-Awesome song.Great riff,cool lyrics,great album opener. <br />2.Exodus-5/5-Awesome song.Great follow up to Bonded By Blood.Has some really violent lyrics,so I wouldn't listen if this stuff offends you. <br />3.And Then There Were None-4/5-Slower than the first two songs,but still pretty good. <br />4.A Lesson In Violence-5/5-My favorite song on the album.Awesome riffs and the best guitar solos on the album. <br />5.Metal Command-2/5-My least favorite song on the album.Nothing special. <br />6.Piranha-5/5-My second favorite song on the album.Awesome intro,and just an awesome song. <br />7-No Love-3/5-An OK song.Has a cool acoustic intro and some cool riffs,but too slow and has some disgusting lyrics. <br />8.Deliver Us To Evil-4/5-A pretty good song,but too long and has too many different riffs,and really evil lyrics. <br />9-Strike Of The Beast-5/5-My third favorite song on the album.The fastest song here,and has some AWESOME drumming courtesy of Tom Hunting.Exodus usually closes wih this in concert. <br />10-And Then There Were None-5/5-This reissue has 2 bonus live tracks.I like this version better because it has Steve Souza on lead vocals instead of Paul Baloff. <br />11-A Lesson In Violence-5/5-Awesome live version. <br />If you don't have any Exodus,I'd definitely start with this album.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the Chicago cast to see what everyone was raving about, and it was definitly worth the time and money. This musical is definitely some very good work. I liked the music so much that I bought the soundtrack, which is worth every penny. <br /> <br />As an actor/singer myself, I enjoyed this work greatly. There is some great vocal work on this soundtrack. Highly recommended.
B000286RNY|3.0|I was out with some buddies this past Tuesday and, for some reason, the talk turned to what was the worst and the best comic book movie. I maintain that the best is Unbreakable, but the others wanted to limit the selection to movies that were adaptations of comics rather than simply movies that captured the underlying myths and tropes of the genre (which, typically, means superheroes, at least in the U.S.). The best adaptation that I know of is probably Spiderman, although X-Men is very close. I personally despise Burton's Batman. Although I understand my friend Matt Cutter's argument that it is Burton's Batman, I can't get over the problem that he allows actors to step outside of the roles they are supposed to be playing, making it as much of a wink-and-a-nod to the meta set rather than a faithful adaptation. I haven't seen Nolan's Batman Begins (it's in my netflix queue though), although I've heard good things about it, nor have I seen Sin City. Hellboy did a great job of capturing the look and feel of the comic that it was drawn from, but I just didn't think it was all that good of a movie.<br /><br />Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer<br /><br />Which brings us to Shaolin Soccer, which would have my vote for the best movie adapted from a manga, if only it had been. Instead, trivia has it that creator and star Stephen Chow had been inspired by an animated television series on soccer called \\"Captain Tsubasa,\\" which may, for all I know, have been based on a manga series. Whatever, the visual effects and broad humor of the movie perfectly capture the style of manga, from the exaggerated facial expressions that Chow and his co-stars make, to the way that the soccer ball tears up the ground and grass and can blowback people in its power. The best scene, by far, is the climatic goal defense, where Mui adapts a kung fu stance and a wavering yin/yang symbol appears in the air before her while the attacking player has an evil demon in the air above him that he draws into the ball itself, which then flies through the air so fast that it becomes a fireball.<br /><br />I found the movie much funnier than J did, and I'm not sure exactly why. Perhaps it's because I'm more familiar with manga and the style of humor that the movie used, which is more disjointed than a Western comedy, with flights of imagination that rival Amelie in their elaborateness (such as the break into a dance sequence straight out of a music video early on). The violence was much more graphic here, as well, although its (I have to say it) \\"comic book violence\\" where no one is hurt for very long, unless it is necessary for the plot.itself, which then flies through the air so fast that it becomes a fireball. <br /> <br />I found the movie much funnier than J did, and I'm not sure exactly why.

B000059TFO|5.0|Like the title states if you are easily offended by racism or you are a modern politically correct, easily offended, useless liberal stay away from this movie. It's better to leave defensive people ignorant. So if you dont know about racism, but you hate it. Buy a movie about Martin Luther King, Jr.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have watched this entire series on DVD and it is worth a look for those interested in war. Some of the best vignettes for me include Easy Company passing a French lady and her baby on the road. The French woman's head has been shaved by her cowardly/heroic compatriots.  Shortly beofre that, an entire group of German prisoners are shot out of hand; one of them had been raised in the US before answering the call. American soldiers are also shown looting and a captured German general makes an excellent speech to his imprisoned band of brothers troops that the watching Americans can very much relate to. It is, in other words, a much truer version of events than the John Wayne/Audie Murphy gruel of old.<br /><br />The soldiers learn both good things and bad about love, life and all the rest as they move on towards Germany and Austria. Their learning processes are well captured. One last vignette is of an American officer shooting a surrendering German boy soldier in the heat of battle. Band of Brothers helps bring war down to its primeval level and that makes it worth 5 or more stars.
B00062IVKS|5.0|Another Scorsese/De Niro/Pesci film, this time a Black & White piece about boxer Jake La Motta. Robert De Niro plays La Motta, a paranoid, jealous man with a violent temper. Pesci plays his brother, Joey La Motta, a good guy that's trying to set Jake straight. Newcomer Cathy Moriarty plays Vickie, Jake's love interest for the film. <br /> <br />I'll just get this out of the way right now: Raging Bull is the best boxing movie ever. The direction is suberb, as they put amazing detail into the fights. Each match was mimicked, punch for punch, from the real bouts that took place in the 40's. The B&W only adds to the gritty feeling, and makes you feel like you're really watching an old boxing match. The cinematography and editing are top-notch. <br /> <br />But the thing that really shines in Raging Bull is the acting, especially De Niro, in what could quite possibly be the best performance of his career. The scene at the end with La Motta in jail is one of the best acted scenes in movie history. It's so simple, yet the raw emotion and regret from Jake makes it so incredibly powerful. Showing extreme dedication to his work, De Niro actually gained 60 lbs. for his scenes as the older La Motta (he could've used a fat suit, but he wanted to go all out and make it as real as possible). There's just not enough good things I could say about De Niro here. The best actor ever, in his prime, and giving one of his best performances ever. That's all you need to hear. Pesci is his usual brilliant self here, and Frank Vincent is quite good as well. The only drawback here is Cathy Moriarty, who shouldn't have received a role this large (especially considering she had never been in a movie before). A lot of her early scenes are kind of boring, and she comes off as un-charismatic and slightly wooden. However, she does get a little better as the film progresses. <br /> <br />Raging Bull was voted as the best movie of the 80's for a reason. While the plot may be simple and straight-forward, this is brilliant filmmaking at it's best.
B000AARKOO|2.0|Amazing...the \\"Pilgrim's Tour\\" special feature, which provides text to go along with the movie, is full of typographical errors, sentence fragments, and slang that is quite inappropriate to the subject. \\"It's\\" and \\"Its\\" are used at random, with no concern for which is appropriate. You'd think that the budget of the DVD might have allowed for <br />someone who knows the language.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Directed by James Cameron. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Bill Paxton. <br /> <br />Titanic is a fictional love story about Rose (Winslet) and an `average joe' Jack (DiCaprio). Both meet on the infamous, unsinkable Titanc ship. Yeah, I just love these one-dimensional characters where the poor are the noble underdogs, and the rich are evil bastards. <br /> <br />Ahh, we all know about Titanic, probably the most overrated movie ever. James Cameron is a fine action and sci-fi director. I repeat, ACTION AND SCI-FI. When it comes to love stories, especially tearjerkers, he has no skill. Why? The man can't write...at all...he just sucks at it. Lets face it, Terminator 2 was an awesome action movie, but the dialogue is cringe-worthy at times. And what about the end of T2? It tried to be deep and heart wrenching, but it failed and came off as stupid. Keep in mind, I love T2. I've seen it more than any other movie, and it still continues to entertain (it's actually one of my favorites). But I won't pretend that it doesn't have any flaws, because it does. So anyway, you get the point. Cameron is a limited director, and shouldn't do anything besides action and sci-fi. Case in point, the dialogue for Titanic is bad too (there's too many embarrassing quotes to list). If anything, Titanic can give you some minor entertainment from it's laughable script. <br /> <br />Instead of focusing on the real tragedy at hand, we get an unnecessary, clich love story. Furthermore, I personally think the premise is ridiculously disrespectful. Taking a tragedy and turning it into a love story. WOW! What's next? 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, or better yet, The Crucifixion (yeah, I bet Jesus had a few ladies on the side. That dirty dog!)? Why is this wrong? Because they're basicially saying, \\"Ok, lets focus on these two characters, and ignore the rest! As long as these two get out, it doesn't matter who else dies!\\". Sure enough, I've seen this movie with different groups of people, and none of them cried (or even cared for that matter) when most of the passengers were killed, but once Leonardo froze to death, then here come the waterworks! I don't care if I spoiled the movie for those that haven't seen it (since you shouldn't watch it anyway). Yep, a pathetic tearjerker ending to make the easily amused women in the crowd cry. No wonder it won so many Oscars. <br /> <br />The acting here is pathetic. Leonardo DiCaprio was still in his teenage heartthrob phase, and didn't have an excellent director like Martin Scorsese to make him look good. As a result, his emotions seem terribly forced and unbelievable. Billy Zane is basicially the same, only twice as bad. It's quite embarrassing to watch, really (he should stick to cool movies like Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight. That was a great horror movie, and his character was pretty funny). <br /> <br />Overall, I give Titanic * (that may be overrating it, actually). This was an insult to the viewer's intelligence, and nothing more than a dull storyline to fill out a 3 hour long borefest. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. No compelling storytelling, no brilliant acting, and no interesting dialogue. Nope, it's almost worthless in every way. Yeah, the boat looked good, but they had $200 million to work with, so you knew it would. I'm sure most of you have already had the displeasure of seeing this, but for those that haven't, NEVER WATCH THIS.
0156027321|4.0|I loved this book but i found certian aspects that left me unhappy and with a feeling of question. the book was a journey for this boy psychologically and physically. the reader is with Pi everystep of the way with no question as to the actuality of the story. i feel the ending was a cop out. it should have left you questing the story he told. trying to figue out which story is true isnt the point of the story in my opinion, the change within pi is. it was more a emotional journey within pi. The book was so interesting and well written until the end. i feel the author should have ended it better perhaps when Pi is older like he does in part 1 of the book and let you see the effect this experience has had on him.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|Ahh...Casino. The last Martin Scorsese/Robert De Niro film (before Scorsese started putting Leonardo DiCaprio in every single one of his movies. Damn it, bring back De Niro!), and the last amazing performance by De Niro (not counting Heat, which was released a couple of weeks after this), before he sunk into mediocrity. \\"Casino\\" uses the same formula as Goodfellas to tell the tale of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro), the runner of a Mob-controlled casino. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a fiery gangster with a bad temper, is sent to look after Sam. Along the way, Sam falls in love with Ginger (Sharon Stone), a greedy b*tch who's only interested in Sam's money. But things get out of hand when Nicky causes trouble, and Ginger continues to see her pimp boyfriend (James Woods) behind Sam's back. In the end, you'll learn why you should never marry a woman who doesn't love you. Based on a true story, Casino is almost 3 hours long, but never gets boring <br /> <br />Much like Goodfellas before it, Casino uses narration to explain the details of the job. Using duel-narration from De Niro and Pesci, Casino is able to explain every little detail about the plot, the mob, and what running a casino is really like. On the other hand, the narration can get a little tiring, as the first 20 minutes consist of nothing but narrating (that's really my only complaint about this movie). But thankfully, the great story sucks you in, and you get used to the narrating. <br /> <br />The acting here is brilliant. You have the awesome combination of De Niro and Pesci, and Stone in her best performance yet. Not only that, but the supporting cast is great as well. James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollack, and Frank Vincent round out a fantastic cast. <br /> <br />Casino tells the perfect story of a powerful organization f*cking up, and how fast you can lose everything. It's kind of funny, I hated this the first time I watched it. But then I bought the special edition DVD (why buy a DVD for a movie I didn't like? I don't know). But then I watched it again, and loved it. One of 1995's best films. Recommended.
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|I was reading the reviews and was amazed that people we're actually getting mad at each other's reviews. Me? I think its funny, its like when I read a sh***y review of a movie, go out and rent it and get blown away by how good I think it is. I guess that's the definition of a review, they are like a**holes, everones got one and they all stink.<br /><br />I gave this recording 4 stars, here are the reasons:<br /><br />1. I love Buddy Guy's guitar work, to me its an instant 3 stars just by who he is.<br /><br />2. I actually liked the Guest musicians, I like Tracy Chapman, and Carlos Santana especially. I'd love to see Carlos and Buddy together in Concert!<br /><br />3. I do think it was over produced a touch, or I would have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />Hey, I loaned this CD to the local Coffee Shop I frequent as they like to play Blues CD's but had never heard of Buddy Guy (same old story). They told me later that customers were saying stuff like \\"Hey who is that playing man!\\", I try to spread the news of the Blues and Buddy whenever I can.<br /><br />I was also fortunately able to win a signed Polka Dot Guitar from Buddy recently at auction and that is something I'll always cherish.<br /><br />I'm grateful to Buddy for where his music takes me, and I'm grateful I've been able to see him live a couple of times and I think he deserves the recent accolades for his great talent.<br /><br />In my opinion the two best live performers I've ever seen have been Muddy Waters & Buddy Guy. And I've seen a lot, Stevie Ray, Clapton, ZZ, BB, Hooker, Stones, Roy Buchannan, Roy Rogers, Allman Bros, Santana, Tubes, etc....
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Have been a big Deep Purple fan almost my whole life. I had *IN ROCK*, *MACHINE HEAD*, *MADE IN JAPAN*, *DEEPEST PURPLE*, ect in my regular listening rotation and they were all absolute classics. However, *BURN* was one of the last albums i picked up from Deep Purple, and i regret that because it is now by far my favorite. <br />There were plenty of things that kept me away from this album such as there being no Gillian and Glover on it, also the fact that Coverdale is on this thing and i'm no fan of Whitesnake's hair-metal foolishness. If you have any doubts about this line-up, don't worry, it all works out just fine on *BURN*. <br /> <br />Actaully David Coverdale is a better vocalist then i intiailly gave him credit for. I used to hear his Whitsnake material all of the time and just wrote him off as another kitsh pop metal singer, but his work with Purple in the 70's is quiet phenomenal. He's got a deep bluesie sounding voice here and his voice is actaully growing on me. Deep Purple technically replaced Ian Gillian with two singers on here, the aformentioned Coverdale and the soulful Glenn Hughs. Both singers share vocal duties, with Dave covering the low-range and Glenn covering the high pitch-range. Glenn Hughs gives his patented \\"Rock & Soul\\" style voice, some find it annoying but i love this guys voice! His finest moments are on \\"Lay Down, Stay Down\\", \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\" and \\"Sail Away\\". *BURN* is a overall much slower and blusier sounding album from Purple, it doesn't have the energy (except for the title track) of albums like *IN ROCK* or *FIREBALL* or any of the other albums with Gillian for that matter, but its has some of the best songwritting in my opion, and definatly Blackmore's best guitar work with Deep Purple. The Mark 3 line-up was extremely underrated and overlooked by many, even by Purple fans. Too bad this line-up was short lived, as i thought *STORMBRINGER* was nearly as good as this as well.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
6305972591|5.0|I agree with alot of you all on this movie it is one of the best all time thriller king ever made. The short story did no justice. The film brought out so much more that what king had in the story.If you read the story you wil understand. There are things in the movie that is not in the story its self.I have to say if you like thrillers and really bloody movies this is the one for you. I would recommend this movie to any thriller lover out there.
B00005YJMX|5.0|OK, my kids saw Van Helsing (dumb movie) at a sleepover last weekend and got into the whole Dracula thing so I sat down and did my research. In the last week I watched all the greats again, Murneau's Nosferatu and then Herzog's version. Today I watched Browning's and Coppola's Dracula and I watched Morrisey's last week (yuk!). I must say the German versions are far scarier and more realistic. Max Von Shrek is truly repulsive while Lugosi seems stiff and almost comical at times. Klaus Kinski nails the role while Oldman (maybe it was Coppola's fault) is more like \\"Count Liberace\\". As far as supporting roles go, if you look at the actors playing Lucy, Renfield and Harker there is no comparison, Murneau and Herzog have stronger casting. I probably shouldn't have watched the films in this order because I used to love the original Dracula and I dig Tod Browning and \\"Freaks\\" and all (check out Herzog's ode to Browning entitled \\"Even Dwarfs Started Small\\") but from the script to lighting to props (i.e., the bats in Browning's Dracula suck and Coppola's are overblown), the \\"Nosferatu's\\" are superior. I'm gonna have to see every flick about \\"Drac\\" ever made in the next few months (can't wait for the 70's trash pics) to give a fair comparison but for now, this is my two cents.  You should watch every film ever made by Werner Herzog.
B0000028RR|5.0|I was introduced to RATM not long ago from a friend of mine. Last year I was a big fan of Metallica and thought RATM is more of the rap/rock crap just like Korn. But when I heard this I knew Korn ripped this off, this is why now we are with clowns like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit. RATM with no doubt was one of the (if not the) best Rap/Rock band ever. Tom Morello had blazing guitar riffs and solos. Timmy C. was an amazing bassist, maybe he was the strongest part of the band, he must along with Steve Harris, Flea, Geezer Butler and Cliff Burton (RIP). Brad Wilk was a nice drummer and Zack De La Rocha is pretty good for a white rapper. <br />Anyway for the album when I first heard it, it blew me away. The best songs here are 'Settle for Nothing', 'Know Your Enemy' and 'Killing in the Name' which is RATM best song for my opinion, and quite possibly the best Rap/Rock song ever. I think this kills any Soundgarden album (Soundgarden was actually a good band) and way way way way way better than anything Audioslave ever put out. Too bad Rage's instrumentalists united with Chris Cornell and formed a gay modern alternative band just like Linkin Park.  <br />PS just buy, 10$ is a steal. Don't even bother with Audioslave...

B000002MT0|2.0|This is literally the ONLY Prince album that gets less than three stars from me, y'all. I love the man an' his eccentric genius, but the material here was just not hittin' for me. It's flawlessly performed as all his work is (the man is the most sheer perfectionist in the biz, which makes his incredibly-prolific output all the more impressive an' mind-blowing), but, in spite of it all, this one jus' left me flat an' uninspired. The stabs at electro-rock an' rap on 'Loose' an' 'Race' respectively jus' don't do it for me on this outing (the latter topic he tackled to much better effect on his next effort in the form of 'We March') an' even a slower ballad like 'Space', while technically well-crafted, lacks the real SOUL to get you enthusiastic about it. This album's definitely dark as others have mentioned an' not for mainstream appeal, but thas' NOT why I don't really like it (y'all should know me by now!). And as I keep stressing its flawlessly-performed. My disappointment is in the sheer BLANDNESS of its perfection. (Yea, so maybe that doesn't make sense, but it sounded good in my head, so I'm stickin' with it!)     <br /> <br />There are however two tittilating numbers on here that make this almost worth having. The grandiose epic title track 'Come' for those \\"18 an' over\\", is a slinky 10-minute-plus groove with a hypnotic horn-and-rhythm section. The other is the searing story of parental abuse an' neglect he tells on 'Papa'. Prince has the amazing ability to find new ways to sum up life an' mankind in general with jus' a couple lines, an' he does this on jus' about every album, even the lesser ones like this one. Here on 'Papa' he gives us words to live by: \\"Fair to partly crazy, deep down we're all the same, Every single one of us knows some kind of pain.\\"
B0000262QW|5.0|The only reason I don't rank this as the BEST Return to Forever album is because \\"Light as a Feather' and \\"Musicmagic\\" are even better! La Fiesta is worth the purchase price alone. Stan Getz was so impressed by this and the \\"Feather\\" album that his Captain Marvel album features contains 3 cuts from the 2 albums, and features Chick Corea on electric piano, Stanley Clarke on electric bass, Airto Moreira on percussion. Flora Purim fits perfectly and effortlessly into the mix. Quite honestly, I've listened to this album so much that I am sick of it. (I have it in vinyl from the 70's.)
B00068NVI4|5.0|What can I say that's not been said before? Five outstanding musicians that conform an excellent band. This concert compiles 35 years of music craftmanship and passion. The first half of the second DVD is an acoustic section with several of their beloved classic songs. Don't miss by any means that piece of art called \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" ... it's worth the price of the double DVD by itself. <br />Yes fans, don't waste your time reading any longer... click for it!
0345363132|5.0|Although I'm an avid reader, I'm fairly new to the historical fiction genre. Having recently read two good historical fiction books, and seeing all the rave reviews for this book, I decided to check it out from the library; I am definitely glad I did! This is not only the best historical fiction novel I've read, but it's also one the best books I've ever read!    Penman completely flips the \\"standard\\" character of Richard III that many of us are familiar with; instead of presenting him as an evil, manipulative hunchback, we are introduced to a character that's honorable, kind and romantic. Penman adroitly manuevers Richard and a large cast of characters through one of the most confusing periods in history (in my opinion)--the War of the Roses.     Richard III is probably most notoriously known for being the (probable) murderer of his two young nephews. However, Penman presents us with an alternative solution that is quite compelling. Will we ever know really whether Richard III murdered his nephews? Probably not. But does Penman (who has made the reader fall in love with Richard throughout the novel) make you fervently wish that Ricard is innocent? You bet.    If you're a fan of historical fiction (and even if you're not), please give this book a shot. You won't regret it!
B000683VI4|5.0|I'm so glad I watched this at home because I was crying my eyes out at the end. The storyline may not be the first of its kind, but the movie is simply beautiful. One cannot help but wish and pray for Allie and Noah to be together. Definitely a tear-jerker. I haven't cried this much over a movie in a long time. I absolutely love the bittersweet ending, and the last words said between Allie and Noah stay after the credits have stopped rolling.
B00008DDXC|2.0|That's what my mom called it once, and thus the name has stuck. <br /> <br />Anyone who's read my review about the third movie knows that I don't really want to like Harry Potter (although his greatness at what he does - whatever he wants - does entice the veiwer to be more amiable) <br /> <br />I shall assume that I am writing for people who already know the limitations of my applause for Mr. Pot..er...Potter.   <br />Let it be known that I gave this movie two stars for two reasons. <br /> <br />1.  Again, I like the music.  As a musicin, my one weakness is that I can really get into the credits of any movie.  Of course, that may also be my Mistie training.... <br /> <br />2.  It has Siegfried in it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Translation: It has a two second cameo of the actor who plays the character Siegfried in the \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" Series.  (He's the Fudge guy who follows Hagrid out of the hut after the latter says something about \\"following the spiders\\") <br /> <br />...Anyway...I personally think that his quality of acting is so great that he (along with the music) makes even watching the Chamber Pot bearable. <br /> <br />*REFLECTION - Has anyone noticed that even though the Potter stories are about the gnostic chosen ones, Christianity cannot be avoided? ie...CHRISTmas, \\"Oh GOD\\", the phoniex (which symbolizes CHRIST)  Just a thought....* <br /> <br />In JMJ, *a Pot scrubing teen*
B000BBOUU4|4.0|I have seen Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory over 100 times and I've ready Charlie and the Chocolate factory at least ten. It is safe to say that neither the older version nor this new one were truly faithful adaptations of Dahl's work. <br />The earlier one added the whole gobstopper background, this one adds tales of Willy's childhood.  No fizzy lifting drinks in this one and no decapitated chickens, but the puppet sequence is gruseome.  <br />Overall I liked this movie.  It wasn't the same as the older version and I liked it for different reasons.  Side by side I'd say: <br />Ooompa Loompas goes to the old one.  The songs in this one, which are from the book, are overproduced leaving the vocals really muddy and difficult to understand, even on the soundtrack.   <br />Factory - the new one. <br />Wonka - the old one.  I love Johnny Depp, but I really didn't like the changes in Wonka.  I think sometimes with movies it's worse to change a character than a whole scene. <br />Veruca's exit - the new one.  The squirrels are scary for kids though. <br />I'm definitely getting this one when it comes on DVD. <br />And Grampa Joe?  Well, he's still a ratbag industrial spy.
B00009W0U4|5.0|There is a rape scene in this movie that is so nasty and brutal it makes the rape victem in I Spit on your Grave seem like she got off lucky.  I wish Irreversible could be discounted as cheap, exploitative trash so that it would not leave me so emotionally scarred. This film presents it's disturbing message in such a daring, orginal way that it's impact lasts for days. The story is told in \\"reverse\\" starting with a graphic act of violence in what seems to be one of the darkest pits of hell then proceeds to tell the story by showing what preceeded each scene including the most brutal rape scene ever commited to celluloid.  Each scene is one contineous and extensive camera take leaving the viewer amazed, horrified, and drained. The \\"end\\" of the movie is the morning of the ensuing horror: a morning filled with light, hope, and peace. Showing me such a horrible end first then showing me such a hopeful beginning and subjecting me to such a graphic rape played havoc on my sensibilities. This is filmmaking at it's most daring and extreme. If you are one of those people who like to be \\"entertained\\" and think movies should be \\"fun\\", for you I give this 0 stars. For movie fans who think they are \\"seen it all\\" and think movies should leave a lasting impression (even a harsh one), then you need to watch this movie.     This movie gets 5 stars but remember to brace yourself for a harrowing time.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This record has been hyped by serious music lovers for months, and I figured it was time that I got it. I wish I wouldve gotten it sooner.<br /><br />Well, thats not for sure, because Frances The Mute is one of those albums where you might not \\"get it\\" immediately. It took me two or three listens to really get it, and I cant help feeling like I might not have even two or three months ago. All I'm saying, as a disclaimer, is that if you get this album and dont like it right away, dont hide it in a corner and forget about it. Keep going back every few months to see if something clicks.<br /><br />As a guitarist, one of the first things I listen for in an album is the guitar work, and the guitar work here is super-human. Any guitarist will appreciate the very, very tight rhythm work and interesting abstract soloing of Omar Rodriquez-Lopez, and will be delighted at the two fantastic John Frusciante solos on 'L'via,' which is most definately the funnest song on the disc.<br /><br />Its rare that you find a band where every single member stands out as extraordinarily talented, but one is found with The Mars Volta. The vocals are a brilliant falsetto of rapture and emotion, the bass is tight and right in the pocket, and the drumming is just fantasticly syncopated goodness, not to mention the surprisingly great trumpet solos and backing by Flea.<br /><br />The lyrics are catchy, interesting and, most importantly, fun to listen to. The parts sung in Spanish are really great sounding and provide a nice avenue away from mainstream rock.<br /><br />The one complaint I have about this record is its length. I understand that its telling a story, and it would hold my attention all the way through, if only 'Miranda That Ghost Just Isnt Holy Anymore' was gone. If this boring, 12 minute amalgom of noise moved the story along in any way, I wouldnt mind. But it doesnt. At all. Its nothing but artistic filler, which would be good if it werent so long winded. I usually skip over it in spite of myself.<br /><br />If youre toeing the line on whether or not to get this, get it, because in the longrun, at least, itll be worth your while.r it in spite of myself. <br /> <br />If youre toeing the line on whether or not to get this, get it, because in the longrun, at least, itll be worth your while.
B000002N3N|5.0|This is the best Enya CD I've ever listened to.  It's soothing and inspired.
B000001E18|5.0|U2's old school fans were able to tolerate Achtung Baby.  It still had several straight forward songs though none that were as anthemic as what the band put out in the 80s with the song One being an exception.  I think many of the old school fans found Zooropa to be the line and the following album, Pop, to be a step beyond it.  I think they had a reaction worse than the one that fans of the Boy/October/War era had when they heard the richly textured, more subdued The Unforgettable Fire.  Still, Unforgettable Fire featured Pride and Bad, two pillars of U2's live act.  Zooropa has not been so fortunate.   <br /> <br />But what does it matter if you keep pleasing those fans, putting out the anthems ad infinitem when you really are an artist that wishes for something more challenging?  Zooropa is certainly a challenging listen from both a lyrical and musical perspective.  It's probably the most different of any U2 album as there's very little straight forward rock here.  It also features characters completely lost, guys who just don't get it.  The album is a ball of confusion representative of people seeking identity but finding all the wrong conclusions.  All the songs take greatly perverted or distorted views with the final song, The Wanderer, seeming to restore reason to the equation but also getting to the wrong conclusion in the end. <br /> <br />There are some \\"techno\\" aspects to be found here.  Lots more orientation towards the rhythm and very little traditional guitar.  Edge's instrument is almost always distorted.   <br /> <br />I'm one who thinks every track is a winner here, though I especially love Numb, Lemon, Dirty Day, and The Wanderer (great cameo by Johnny Cash).  Stay (Faraway, So Close!) is the most conventional song here and Dirty Day is the closest to straight forward rock.   <br /> <br />This album is not recommended to those who do not want to listen to music that leans towards the experimental and the electronic.  Listening to Achtung Baby can get you ready for it but not entirely prepared you because it is THAT different but equally excellent nonetheless.   Open your mind, realize this is the album of lost souls, and give it a few listens.  You might just find that you love it.
0743233832|3.0|This translation of the Greek writings that the author called \\"To Himself\\" is smooth, deft, and self-assured; the book sits well in the hand; the subject index is thorough.  For generations Marcus Aurelius has proven not only a welcome counselor, but a worthy opponent to measure oneself against.  Why does this version leave one feeling not refreshed but harangued? <br /> <br />  In an earnest attempt to reach modern readers, something has gone wrong with the tone.  The pages are peppered with the imperative contraction \\"Don't,\\" and the \\"You\\" being addressed is not a man conferring with his soul, but a smug preacher hectoring us with his own perfection.  Yet consider how often Marcus returns to certain themes---that you should not mind what other people think of you; that you should cease to assign blame, or feel resentment for ill-treatment; that since life is but breath you should not care whether yours is long or short.  The very repetition shows how hard it was for him to attain permanent detachment:  you need not exhort yourself to meet standards you have already mastered. <br />   <br />  Perhaps a claim made in the introduction, explaining the rationale for a new edition, hints at what seems amiss in The Emperor's Handbook:  \\"[W]e tend to conceive of freedom, even the religious freedoms we take pretty much for granted, in largely political terms, perhaps because, second, we have come seriously to doubt our psychological freedom, or freedom of mind.\\" (9)  (How's that again?  Rather, in an era of contracting public freedoms and increasing pressure toward conformity, many contend that the only true liberty lies within.)  A version inspired by such assumptions skews the even-tempered voice of the fellow human being who wrote these meditations.  The layout, with bullet lists and sound bites, makes the book look like yet another treatise aimed at the tired businessman; and the new title seems a marketing ploy.  The world needs no more emperors. <br /> <br />When judging a work in a foreign tongue, it is wise to use one translation as a corrective for another.  By all means buy this version, as I did:  the celebrated and successful give it high praise (see dust jacket).  And buy one of the other renderings; consult the reviews on this site for Hays, or Staniforth.  Then read them in tandem, compare and contrast, in order to better \\"See things for what they are\\" (Book 12, Section 10) for yourself. <br />
0790729628|4.0|Where do you vote in rating the Philip Dick book, the Ridley Scott theatrical film release and the director's cut version? Personally, I go for the theatrical release version of the film. I'd love to see the rumoured director's cut of the director's cut.<br /><br />What Dick's book is about is the effect man made and man like machines have on the society he lives in, one of Dick's most important themes, which crops up again and again in his books. The film drops Dick's focus on (near future) society for a more action focused plot. In both versions of the film the 'replicants' are actually the heroes, super humans in experience and power who yet are doomed to die at the expiration of their term, a safety device built in by their creator to remove their danger to humanity. It makes them more desperate. In the film these androids are sexy, glamorous and attractive, and Rutger Hauer has one of the best dying speeches in all cinema. In both versions of the film another 'star' is the superb sets, some of the best ever made. The sets alone would elevate this film into classic status, because they create an overwhelming atmosphere against which the action takes place.<br /><br />Deckard, the blade runner, is an ambiguous protagonist. If you think about it, the police know who these replicants are, and when they are going to 'expire'. Blade runners take out escaped replicants because it is government policy to do so, no more than that. The replicants are dangerous, but so is everyone in this society. Deckard is not a hero, just a bureaucratic killer who is hired to tidy up. Both versions of the film build on his ambiguous status: the theatrical release slightly emphasising more the relationship with Rachael (OK, a conventional romance) while suggesting that she too might be (is) a replicant. The director's cut goes further: Deckard protects Rachael against the replicants but it is hinted that he himself is one.<br /><br />The director's cut takes out the voice over of the theatrical release, redolent of 40s noir, and so reduces the mystery element of the film in favour of the sci fi action element. Gone also are some of the interaction scenes with Rachael. Deckard becomes more of a standard actioner 'hero', gun raised protectingly over the conventional helpless female. Gone also is the superbly ambiguous ending (\\"But we don't know how much time we have (together)\\". \\"Who does\\".) which reinforced the romance and the personal relationship theme of the first version. Overall a much more conventional, special effects based action film, with a very deep conflict with Dick's basic theme. Probably why so many critics liked it better.the theatrical release, redolent of 40s noir, and so reduces the mystery element of the film in favour of the sci fi action element.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|Of course they're not going to sound like they did back in the late sixties! Probably the first time in almost 40 years for them all to play together sober and/or not stoned out of their heads.  <br /> <br />Ginger escaped drugs (amphetamines), Jack showed up with a fresh replacement liver less than a year old from a long history of drink, and Eric's history of heroin and other stuff addiction is part of history. I was glad to see them ALIVE. <br /> <br />Yes, I think maybe I would have liked to see Eric playing an SG or 335, but as the interviews stated they were all about coming out and playing as themselves now. It was therefore logical to see Eric with his Strat \\"Blacky\\". <br /> <br />Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker are really the standouts. Makes you wonder why they were not possessed of way better careers than Eric.  Seems more a tribute to lucking into better management than lack of self-destructive tendencies which they all seemed to have. <br /> <br />The modern amplification choices are an improvement. You get to hear the phrasing and technique a few decades adds. Yes, maybe more reserved players compared to the youthful abandon of the sixties, but their interplay now is absolutely amazing. As a bassist who used to play the Gibson EB-3 into a screaming tube bass rig, it was an incredibly sloppy setup and covered a multitude of sins in your playing. To hear Jack playing a real quality fretless instrument where you either have to be competent or everyone will hear you suck famously was great.
B0000JCFPE|3.0|One of the greatest of thrillers, this film throws it all overboard for a 'shock' ending. After two hours of mounting tension based firmly on an 'innocent but complex' character reading of the two main characters, the ending reveals that the villain was guilty after all. The psycho killer made fools of us as well as of the cop. It's really been two hours of the swamp monster kills again straight out of z grade movie history and as boring as could be. To compromise your audience like this is, hey, maybe avant garde, guying the thriller conventions and audiences' implicit sadism in watching this kind of stuff. But the film made a lot of money,  so I guess the film maker is just showing contempt for his audience after all. Roll up, roll up, and be exploited.And it could have been so good.
B00003CXD0|4.0|In 1982, when \\"Tootsie\\" was released, audiences flocked to see it.  As I watch it now on DVD, the film still holds up exceptionally well.  Surprisingly, the jokes, the relationships, and the theme of the movie don't seem dated at all.  That's probably why \\"Tootsie\\" is the number two comedy of all-time according to the AFI (\\"Some Like It Hot\\" being number one, with a theme not too coincidentally similar to Tootsie's). <br /> <br />Dustin Hoffman turns in one of his best performances as a womanizing, self-centered actor who learns what it's like to be the opposite sex.  After all these years, this movie still makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br />My only complaint with the DVD is that there are not many features on it.  There was a lot of notoriety surrounding the production of the film, and it seems that there were a countless number of screenwriters who were hired to polish the script.  It would be interesting to hear some interviews with Dustin Hoffman, director Sydney Pollack, and screenwriters Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, who admitted never having even met one another until after the film was released.  Perhaps in the special edition.
B0000214F0|4.0|This 1979 film is reminiscent of Fellini Satyricon (1969) and I Claudius (1974). From the first it takes the monumental doom laden sets and the cast of loonies being 'depraved'. From the second it takes the snarling personal politics of royalty attempting to rule a worldwide empire.<br /><br />The sets really are superb. Enormous attention to detail and a collection of the world's best set and costume designers make this film a work of art. The actors all put in a fine job, except that O'Toole and McDowell get to overact on more than one occasion, showing the lack of directorial control that bedevils the film.<br /><br />Forget about historical correctness. Most evidence has been lost (true for most periods in history) and what remains is partial and biased, written by members of the senatorial class whom Caligula attacked. The film is both memorable and convincing, however, which cannot be said about many historical films.<br /><br />The pornography is a sales device. That is, we are told that Guccione interpolated sex scenes after the film was finished and that this alienated the director, Tinto Brass, who removed his name from the credits. But Tinto is into pornography, and helped organise the final orgy which seems really typical of the free love 70s. The pornography is restricted to one scene, the senatorial brothel, integral to the depiction of Caligula's humiliation of the Senate. Elsewhere it is little more than nudity (and the Romans didn't wear many clothes except on formal occasions) and a couple of flashes of two actresses labia. The brothel scene did have several scenes of fellatio and one insertion, but these scenes were not emphasised; they added to the effect of the scene, and effectively so.<br /><br />Although the motives of all concerned with the film are reasonably suspect, it did succeed in depicting Roman times, Roman morality and Roman politics in a believable manner. Lack of an integrated directorial style may have caused Caligula to fall short of being a 'great' film, but it is a very interesting failure indeed. And was America in the 70s like this too?o fall short of being a 'great' film, but it is a very interesting failure indeed. And was America in the 70s like this too?
B00001U0DP|5.0|Until I saw \\"Life Is Beautiful,\\" I didn't go to see many foreign films.  After I saw it and fell in love with it, I acquired a new appreciation for Italian, French, and German cinema.  It really opened my eyes to international moviemaking. <br /> <br />\\"Life Is Beautuiful\\" plays like two movies; the first hour a charming romantic comedy, the second hour a drama set in a concentration camp.  But even in the face of death in the second half, this film makes me laugh and cry, a rare emotional quality few movies have offered in recent years. <br /> <br />Roberto Benigni is hilarious as a waiter with a Chaplin-esque style of physical comedy.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the music is wonderful, too. <br /> <br />Some have criticized \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" as being too schmultzy.  Maybe it is, but I still loved every minute of it.

You can get as good or better copy by taping one of the frequent showings on TCM (Turner Classic Movies.) Most reviewers concentrate on reviewing the film itself rather than the quality of the DVD or VHS transfer, however, I want to emphasize that I was not impressed with the DVD quality. If you want the DVD strictly for the film, that's one thing, but if you expect a quality DVD transfer (considering the higher cost), you'll probably be as disappointed as I was. But, it's your call and your money--just don't say you were not warned. Ratings: Film 5, DVD quality 2.  ADDENDUM 9/2009: The selling price was about $30 when this review was first posted.

6302484723|4.0|Wow - just finished watching this.  And I'm glad to say Mike's Video and Music lets you rent kid's tapes for free for one night.  If you have a copy of \\"Essential Iron Man\\" Vol. 2, this will look very familiar.  Basically you're looking at two stories - the first has the Mandarin (with a really BAD stereotypical Asian accent - \\"Wheara do you keepa da prans, Iron Man???!!!\\") kidnapping Happy Hogan, who has donned IM's armor to stave off suspicion that Tony Stark and Iron Man are the same.  Mistaking Hogan as the *real* IM, the Mandarin kidnaps Happy and basically kicks the crap out of him.  Stark builds another Iron Man suit and subsequently kicks the crap out of the Mandarin.  Anyway... the second story has Iron Man fighting the Chameleon and Kraven (spelled \\"Craven\\" on the sleeve\\"), and somehow Captain American gets mixed in and on we go.  There's a really big shark out there too.  Anyway again...<br /><br />From what I know, this is a copy of two of the old IM cartoon from the 60s, so don't expect much if you crave excellent animation.  Basically it looks like a bunch of stills were taken straight from the comics, put into a cartoon, and shaken up to provide \\"animation\\".<br /><br />There are a couple of highlights - the music is awesome!  The theme song in particular is a real blast.  On top of that, I don't recall many superhero cartoons from any era that actually displayed onomatopoeia.  You actually see \\"ka-blam\\" and \\"whoosh\\" during the shows.  Very, very cool.  Also, the tape I saw had Spider-Man telling us to register to vote - wow!  A register-to-vote PSA from our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!  Very, very, very cool!<br /><br />So if you're looking for some good, cheesy fun for a half hour or so, dig in.  If you're looking for something a la the Ultimate Spider-man game... just hope your rental place offers 1 free night...
B00006RJHG|4.0|A slasher film to be appreciated. While you only see 2 murders ( 1 a smothering and the other a stabbing, which is pretty brutally done ), the others are all there and you know, and although they dont show the murders, this movie keeps you in suspense. A well done plot and very creepy feeling to the moviE.  <br /> <br />Basically a sorority house full of young ladies start getting very menacing and threating perverted phone calls, only to find out that the stalker is making the calls from inside the house and trying to kill them off one by one. <br /> <br />While this movie lacks in gore extremely, it doesnt lack in anything else. The acting is fine, the directing/edioting is fine,  the feel of suspense and terror is very much so there. When you are done you will appreciate this for what it is and thats a top of the line slasher flick that does not have to use tons of vi=ewable gore and violence to make the film good just the feeling of knowing what is going on, truly  one of the best slasher films ever made. <br /> <br />It took me a second time of watching to truly appreciate this and realize it was made on intelligence and thrived on a very good story line and very EERIE feeling than anyything else a sup[erb money worth getting and with no question a classic. <br /> <br />I found this in a local DVD store for a bit pricey at about 30$, and being I never saw it took a big chance cause I dont like spending that much unless I know what im definitly gettinmg. Like I said pricey but definitly worth it. They have the cheaper regular edition here so for those who never saw it and want to take a chance get the cheap one, you may like it enough toto buy the special edition. But this movie is worth the purchase I had it for about 12 months now and have watched it numerous times very good and enjoyable one of the best slasher flicks to ever be made. IMO atleast.
B00019PDKC|5.0|This is no ordinary rock album. <br />This is different, and very beautifully so.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I thought that this CD was excellent  with just a few problems on it. on the CD there are 13 tracks 12 of them are brilliant, the other 1 should be taken off in my opinon. That 1 is \\"Whatsername\\" this song is ok but not up to the standard of the other songs so it sort of pulls down the album. But dont let that put you off buying the album I've had th album for nearly a year and never stopped listening to it for a long period of time. The other song is \\"Are We The Waiting\\" this song is better than whatsername but not as good as the other songs.  <br /> <br />I would review this album 9/10 <br />and <br /> <br />Whatsername 4/10 <br />Are we the waiting 6/10 <br />the rest of the songs 10/10 <br /> <br />I have given this album 5
0066620996|5.0|I found this book to be invaluable in realizing what it takes for a good company to make the leap to great.  The amount of resarch and effort it took to complete this book is well documented and verified.  It changes the way you look at your company and personnel as well as yourself.  You challenge yourself more and your fellow employees as well.  Also, you look at other companies differently with the knowledge gained from this book.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I was so happy when the word leaked that Alicia was doing an unplugged album - I was curious to see how she'd rework her earlier releases and also to see what new music she'd release on this album. Alicia is one of those vocalists who people either love or hate (based on comments on other messageboards) - the debate about her singing reminds me of similar debates about Vanessa Williams, Sade & Erykah Badu.<br /><br />Anyway this is the 1st unplugged album I've purchased since Maxwell's so it's been a while but Alicia's was well worth the wait.  Currently Alicia is in the crop of young performers like Fantasia, Leela James, Dwele, Kindred & even Keyshia Cole who try to keep some soulfulness in their music & singing style and I greatly appreciate those who don't feel the need to add a rapper to every other song to make it \\"hott\\".<br /><br />The old songs that were reworked sound fantastic, my faves are: Heartburn, A Woman's Worth (really great reworking of the Isley Bros sample + her backup vocalists sound AMAZING on this track), Goodbye/Butterflyz (it was great to hear these two songs which were two of my faves from her 1st album).<br /><br />**Also I could hear Diary & If I Ain't Got You a trillion times and not get sick of either.  Diary is really reworked for a more acoustic feel and Jermaine's crazy solo at the end MAKES the song hotter than it was.  I'd never heard Streets of NY before but really enjoyed the poetry/jazz feel of this rendition.<br /><br />Now to the new:<br /><br />I love Unbreakable (it had to grow on me but...), I like the sentiment of the song and the message she's trying to convey.<br /><br />Stolen Moments is INSANE - I closed my eyes and listened to it over & over because the entire production of this song truly reminds me of Stevie Wonder in his heydey, it builds to a cresendo, her vocals, the backup vocalists, the music...just WOW!!!<br /><br />Wild Horses - didn't like it when I initially viewed the Unplugged show (Levine's vocals bug me) but after a few listens, it's ok.  Their voices mesh well when they sing together but his solo parts just do nothing for me.<br /><br />Every Little Bit Hurts - another great cover by Alicia.  Her voice and the soulful hurt she puts into performing this should help bring the song to life.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase and again contend that if given time and creative freedom, Alicia can eventually produce an album as prolific as Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life.evine's vocals bug me) but after a few listens, it's ok.

0670033375|3.0|I liked the tenor of this book, however, I wonder how much is in error: <br />the Great Northern RY WAS NOT a land grant RR, DID NOT come near Missoula (the Northern Pacific was/did).
B0002J54JG|5.0|This is my favourite Dylan album as it embodies all that is great about Dylan, the brilliant use of words and in this case, the emotional outpouring that is very personal and heartrending.  Anyone who has gone or is going through any emotional rollercoaster ride can identify and empathise with this album.  It's also a great way to recuperate knowing that even the great Dylan himself isn't immune to such downtimes.  Almost makes us feel the great man is also one of us.  This version has been remastered and comes in a very nice looking mini-lp replica sleeve as well.  Highly recommended!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This is one of Dream Theater's must get cds. If you don't have this cd you have to get it. It is filled with double kick drum maddnes in Panic Attack and in the fist song, Root Of All Evil, Mike portnoy goes crazy on his floor tom. There are some slower songs on this cd like Answer Lies Within and Sacrificed Sons but one of my favorite songs is the name song octivarium. In this song the begining is like when the Grateful Dead do space and from the middle to the end there is quiet singing but this cd is da bomb. So invest and BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B00000FC5H|5.0|This is the best one-disc compilation of EW&F that is out there and the remastered sound means they've never sounded better.  All the tracks are worthy selections and 17 songs means you get great value for your money.  If you are new to EW&F and want to get a good representation of the band without having to get all the albums, then this one is the one for you; tracks that stand the test of time.  Highly recommended!
B00005JMAH|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. My mother forbid me to watch and well what did i do? i watched it. Always the rebel. Anyways i felt that this was as faithful to the book as a movie adapted from a book could be.I liked the first two but really felt as if they were kids movies.But with the 4th, 5th, and 6th book, Rowling takes a complete u-turn from happy kiddie book and movie, to an adult level with suspense, terroe, death, and the ultimate battle between good and evil. The director of this film, apparently wanted to start that dark journey early. I dont disagree with this move at all. To me it tells parents of younger children, that it gets a lot darker and worse here on out. Fortunately i only one or two gripes about this adaptation. For one, i didnt like that the patronus was portrayed as a shield instead of a Stag that chases the dementors down. my second gripe is a minor one but it was a bit disappointing to me anyway, was when they were in the shrieking shack and Hermione told Lupin she knew he was a werewolf, he explained why the shrieking shack got it's name and told a small side story of James, Sirius and Peter. I know it's stupid to be mad about that but thats me. But other then that i loved the film and cannot wait to see the last 4 movies because they become a little darker and i am excited for the 7th and final book.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|I've also like you seen all the hype and the consistent top-5 placings in most lists of greatest albums ever etc and to some extent, I do agree with those who ask why?<br /><br />His voice sucks, the production is so bare and yes, even painful to the ear at times but I guess the answer as to how others can listen to the same thing and say this is the best thing since whatever is to take this whole album in the context of its time.<br /><br />Timing is everything and is especially so in the pop music world.  Just ask the Beatles and even Elvis.  When this album came out in the mid-60s, no one treated the music that was out there at the time as anything other than a cheap and simple way to entertain and that was it.<br /><br />With Bob Dylan, though, he was basically a poet who used the medium to showcase his brilliant talent with words.  His raspy voice and irreverent approach to melody and the sound quality of his offerings seemed deliberate as he wanted people to focus on the words which to him was most important and not to let the other stuff detract or distract from them.<br /><br />This approach influenced countless others who realised that it was possible to tell a message using pop music without having \\"talent\\" in a sense of having a brilliant voice or being a brilliant musician.  Of course you had to be good at something but you had to have a good story to tell.<br /><br />Would Dylan have succeeded today or even in the 50s?  Probably not as we've seen earlier, timing is everything.  Because of Dylan's approach to music, his influence gave the confidence to many other greats with a message to tell to just do it!  The Beatles' style changed from their boy band teeny bopper image to what amounted to their most brilliant work (anything from \\"Rubber Soul\\" onwards), Jimi Hendrix (he was always conscious about his voice but was encouraged to come out after hearing Dylan), Bruce Springsteen (just see the writing style especially on his early records) and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />For these reasons, and the fact that this album epitomises most of what makes Dylan great is why this album is and will always be at or near the top of any greatest album list.  Like it or not, the whole pop music history owes a great deal to Dylan, the man who showed that even the humble pop album can be a work of art.rds) and the list goes on and on.  <br /> <br />For these reasons, and the fact that this album epitomises most of what makes Dylan great is why this album is and will always be at or near the top of any greatest album list.

B00008977N|5.0|My wife and I first saw this concert when it aired on T.V. god knows how many years ago.  We were leaving to go on a date and I was reaching to shut down the t.v. when I stoopped for just a second to see what it was....that was all she wrote.  Ever since my wife and I have been the equivalent of brainless giddy crying screaming groupies when it comes to this concert.  I taped it off the t.v. then bought the VHS tape and ultimately got the DVD.  Is the video grainy..I don't know and I don't care.  Did they re-dub anything...I don't know and I don't care.  What I do know is that I watch it at least once every 2 months and love it as much each time.  Take it from a guy who hates groupies but couldn't help but become one, get this DVD and play it until the plastic warps.
B0000541AM|5.0|Get this one. Don't buy the \\"ultimate Directors cut\\" unless you want to see the special features which are the actors talking about the movie etc... This is the original movie that made it a cult classic. the other one has animation storyboards that go from scene to scene making it like a comic book and taking alot of the drama out of the film. <br />
B000BBYMA2|5.0|This movie kicks so much ass! And you can still get it NEW at Amazon UK...Just look it up, and make sure you get the NTSC 5.1 version. I paid roughly $35 american, and it was way worht it.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|I would have much rather scene deleted scenes then his Animated Story Board scenes which completly takes the drama out of the film. There was no need for this to be added to this great cult classic. <br /> <br />LAME <br /> <br />get the original quick!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Excellent series and DVD. If you like Sci-Fi, complex characters, or good story telling, then this series is for you.<br /><br />You do not have to be a fan of the original TV series to enjoy this. My wife never saw a TV episode of \\"Firefly\\", but she is watching every eposide of this DVD with me, and enjoying it.
0671027387|5.0|As usual this author's hit a home run.  What a great read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was originally told I should watch the Buffy series, and I got hooked on that and watched them all.  The same people suggested Firefly, and because it was from Whedon, I thought okay, perhaps.  I rented disk 1 and it sat around for days, but then I saw that Nathan Fillion was in it, and he was a fine sight to look at in the last episodes of Buffy, so I figured I should watch Firefly.  Thats  all it took.  Now there are no more episodes to watch and I can only dare to hope there will be more.  Being over 40 and long ago having posters of Captain Kirk on my wall, these shows are a great improvement over Star Trek and Star Wars.  It is mind boggling that a show like this got cancelled so early while other shows less worthy go on and on.  Don't let the western aspect of these shows turn you off, it is refreshing and superbly done.  And yes, Captain Reynolds, you are tooooo pretty!
1563894696|4.0|Having been thoroughly disappointed by Miller's Dark Knight Strikes Again, I was more than eager to appease my appreciation for Batman with this title, \\"The Long Halloween.\\" Unlike Strikes Again, I was not disappointed in the least. The Long Halloween builds upon the world of Miller's Year One, with Gordon a captain in the Gotham Police force, Harvey Dent a struggling D.A., and Bruce Wayne a posh, young millionaire.  <br /> <br />Yet when the waring crime families of Gotham come to a head, and one by one, members of their own families are being picked off, who is to blame? And why does this malicious serial killer only strike on holidays, earning the apt nickname \\"Holiday\\"? The reward of Long Holiday is the payoff. Loeb, with Miller's blessing, has a created a rich crime-ridden, noir style mystery masterwork within the context of Batman's early years, and Sale's artwork richly depicts the terrors of the Gotham underworld, from the halls of Arkham, to the tops of immense skyscrapers, nothing escapes his pen. His line is communicated vividly, in every rippled Batsy bicep.  <br /> <br />Long Halloween is an outstanding audition to the Batman catalogue. It combines the best of the Batman villans, the best of artwork, and the fine tuned storytelling of Loeb in one stunning piece of work.
B0002858YS|5.0|These days I rarely listen to radio and prefer to find out about new music on the internet.  Being \\"Generation X\\" myself, I was intrigued a few months ago as I started reading on the net about the \\"new wave revival\\" featuring a proliferation of bands who are resurrecting that old 1980's sound with a bit of a modern, emo style twist.  The band that I kept reading about, the one that seemed to be cited most commonly, was The Killers.  That frequent recognition, coupled with my exposure to the driving single \\"Mr. Brightside\\" (a great tune), motivated me to buy this album. <br /> <br />Initially the album was just okay, but after listening to Hot Fuss repeatedly over the last several weeks, it has truly grown on me.  There are some very infectious tunes on this album.  These guys are clearly having fun; the music is compelling, and the band sings and plays with an intensity that will draw you in.  Generally this album is synth-backed, guitar-based, new wave/emo style pop-punk - and it ultimately works.   <br /> <br />The Killers have included enough variety on the disc to keep you interested.  I must say that contrary to the suggestion from the lead Amazon.com review, I LOVE the chant on \\"All These Things that I've Done\\" -- I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier -- that is the most singular moment on this disc, one that you will remember and might even sing to yourself, a place that opens to an unexpected but exhilirating passage through a gospel-laden choral crescendo.  A similar but moderated moment bubbles up during \\"Andy, You're a Star.\\"  There are several other lines from this disc that I just can't keep out of my head, like the opening of the syncopated \\"Believe Me Natalie.\\"  These songs and lyrics aren't especially profound, but they are undeniably fun. <br /> <br />To sum it up, in my opinion, \\"Hot Fuss\\" is deserving of the attention it's been receiving.  If you like the single(s) you've heard from this album, you'll like the rest of the tracks as well.  I'm sureother bands will jump on the \\"new wave revival\\" bandwagon, but I'm not convinced that many will be as effective as The Killers.
038073186X|4.0|'Shutter Island' is perhaps the most entertaining Dennis Lehane book I've read, and I've read them all.  In it he diverts from the Boston private eye(s) tracking down horribly violent sleazeballs and changes the venue to an island in outer Boston harbor where facilities for the criminally insane are housed.  We are also cast back to the early 1950s when some \\"pioneering\\" experimentation on the brain (specifically, lobotomies) was considered at the forefront of medical science.  Throw in a hurricane and some very bizarre mischief and you have the ingredients of a perfectly creepy, enjoyable novel.<br /><br />Now as for the story, it is a bit complex.  There are many twists and turns until the very end.  Suffice to say we have a couple of investigators sent to the island to determine the fate of a dangerous killer (a woman who drowned her children).  But we soon learn nothing is what it appears to be.  Lehane does a brilliant job keeping the tension tight and the reader guessing.  Unfortunately my only complaint is that he was perhaps too clever for his own good; the final plot twist was a bit much for this reader.  Less would have been more.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000AMPZF8|2.0|If you like over done, contrived music, then you'll like this.  The singer is annoying constantly singing way above his range with way too much vibrato.  Sounds like he's being killed. <br />It's like Radiohead combined with ranchero music.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Against my better judgment, for I know I shall reap a storm of negative votes for saying it, I'm just going to say the first thing that comes to mind when I watched this film:  \\"Where are the commercials?\\"  In all seriousness, STARSHIP TROOPERS felt like a UPN, Sunday-afternoon, made-for-television science fiction show.  The acting is horrendous, the characters have been cut out of a bad comic strip, and the dialogue serves up such gems as:<br /><br />\\"Hey Johnny!<br /><br />\\"Yeah.\\"<br /><br />\\"You kill bugs good.\\"<br /><br />\\"Thanks.\\"<br /><br />If the film had been directed by anyone else (and I mean anyone), I wouldn't even give this picture a second look.  But since I respect some of Verhoeven's work, here I am trying to make sense of this awful movie.  Okay.  So let's say that the movie is not supposed to take itself seriously.  Following in line with other reviewers, let's assume that STARSHIP TROOPERS is a satire of militarism, fascism, and Nazi ideology.  Okay.  All I can say is, if that's the case, Verhoeven could have done a much better job.  If you're trying to make a satire, let's make an intelligent satire.  Sure, perhaps we are supposed to imagine that this film is engineered to look like a cheesy, wartime propaganda film.  If that is what STARSHIP TROOPERS is trying to do, then it hits the mark.  But, it also fails to involve the audience on a deeper level because its lack of complexity and intelligence limits its potential.<br /><br />Either you're making a satire or you're making a 1950s B-movie with a host of special effects.  I say, \\"Choose.\\"  I'd place this film in the latter category.  If you're a fan of Verhoeven, I would suggest that you skip this film.  I can't say that I recommend STARSHIP TROOPERS to anyone.
B00002SSRZ|1.0|If you're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review.  <br /> <br />That said, this DTS disc sounds terrible. Why?  <br /> <br />1- If you're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs, you will hardly recognize them here. The multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix; in other words, they sound totally different from each other.  <br /> <br />2- This disc doesn't have the fidelity of the SONY re-mastered Abraxas. The tape hiss is very noticeable, and the overall sound is very dull. Just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley. <br /> <br />Save your money and \\"maybe\\" someday SONY will release a multi-channel SACD from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd.
B00005UDFZ|5.0|Almost a year ago I was away on a one week photo workshop. After a few days our teacher treated us to this dvd while saying that \\"this is to show you that real artists also struggle to achieve what they want. They are not merely superstars that always can deliver at the tip of a hat\\".......... The film started and we watched the great ensemble of artists giving their all to get the best possible result out of the recording sessions. I have to say it was kind of encouraging for me to watch and to hearing a voice saying \\"take 132\\" while the great artists are getting ready to record. It shows that no man is infallible. We're getting a really interesting glimpse into how things are working when an artist is recording an album. I was sitting there watching and then came the clip where Carreras is singing Maria and my mouth just fell wide open. Something went \\"click\\" in my head and it's possible that my heart skipped a beat too and I was completely hooked on this absolutely beautiful voice. The first thing I did when returning back home was to order a copy of this dvd and then I started checking out Jos Carreras and at the moment I'm the proud and delighted owner of a substantial opera collection - all of them of course with Carreras singing the tenor role. <br /> <br />This dvd is showing us clips from rehearsals and recording sessions as well as some brief comments from the singers about how they feel about working with Bernstein; Troyanos and Te Kanawa are talking about their \\"connection\\" to the music of West Side Story and of course we have the more or less (in)famous episode where Carreras is cut of in the middle of \\"Maria\\" and someone is saying that this was the end of the session and they have to continue the next day. Carreras, who obviously had worked a lot to get into the right mood to sing this song, in addition to the tension because of a vital top G still not recorded, gets cut of and reacts in a very natural way, I think. He utters a few words in Spanish; (not saying anything nice, I guess) collects his notes and then storms out of the studio. However, the next day he returns in resplendent voice and delivers his top note without any seemingly problems..... <br /> <br />It's also really fun watching the recording of \\"America\\" where the artists in addition to Bernstein himself are literally dancing around the studio. I just love watching this. I especially love the look on the face of one of the singers when the song ends; you can see the satisfaction just glowing, because she knows they have pulled it off perfectly. <br /> <br />There are lots of things I could say about this dvd, but I don't want to spoil all the fun for those who haven't watched it yet. What I can say is that this is a \\"spirited\\" injection for all those people out there struggling to achieve something, in addition to being a wonderful testament to Bernstein and his music as well as the musicianship of Carreras, Te Kanawa and the late Tatia Troyanos. Don't miss this opportunity to watch real geniuses at work...... <br /> <br />PS. I just have to add that \\"my\\" workshop ended with almost all the participants going around singing \\"I feel pretty\\", becuase we felt that we had triumphed at last, and I can tell you that this song is really \\"contagious\\"....
6304806426|1.0|A boring, slow, meandering, uninteresting, shallow story about selfish people told with a lot of money, exotic locations, period costumes, and blaring orchesteral music that fooled the critics into believing it was \\"supposed\\" to be a good movie.    I have seen many reviews saying it was good, but I have never met anybody who enjoyed watching it or liked the story it was trying to tell.    I think you can get a great deal of insight into what type of movie this is and who the target audience is (and decide ahead of time if this movie is for you) by reading the reviews of the people who liked it.
B000B5XOYI|3.0|The secretive & masked superhero character Batman (initially named Birdman) was first created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger for the comic book company known as \\"Detective Comics\\" (or DC Comics) back in May, 1939; and has remained a very popular comic book superhero ever since.  The popularity of the character inspired the production of a live-action big-screen film in 1989.  Simply entitled \\"Batman\\", it was directed by the well-known Tim Burton.  To play the leading role of Batman, whose unmasked identity is millionaire Bruce Wayne, was actor Michael Keaton.  Battling Batman during this first film was his arch nemesis the Joker, who was once the man named Jack Napier (Jack Nickolson).  Determined to take over the fictitious metropolis of Gotham City, the Joker wreaks havoc as he takes over full control of the criminal underworld.  Powerless to defeat the Joker, Gotham City Police Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) must put his trust into the caped & masked Dark Knight known as Batman to stop the Joker once and for all. <br /> <br />Using a mix of dark cinematography, good special effects and reasonable acting, the 1989 \\"Batman\\" was a relatively good film that I would rate with 4 out of 5 stars.  Three years later in 1992, Michael Keaton again played the Caped Crusader Batman in the next Batman film entitled \\"Batman Returns\\".  With the Joker safely imprisoned, Gotham City's underworld is ripe for being taken over once again by another deadly criminal, this time in the form of the disfigured man who becomes known as the Penguin (Danny DeVito).  Again directed by Tim Burton, \\"Batman Returns\\" was even darker than the first, but allowed Batman to fall in love with a woman named Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) that decides to become the masked criminal known as Catwoman after being pushed out of a window and aided by alley cats.  Between Penguin's bomb-carrying penguins and the obsessive love/hate relationship that develops between Batman and Catwoman, Batman again has his hands full in trying to keep the citizens of Gotham City safe.  Overall, I rate the sequel \\"Batman Returns\\" with 3.5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />Three years later in 1995, Joel Schumacher was given the opportunity to direct the third Batman film.  Entitled \\"Batman Forever\\", the Caped Crusader/millionaire Bruce Wayne was played by Val Kilmer instead of Michael Keaton.  This film begins at a circus' (owned by Bruce Wayne) performance in Gotham City, but it is disrupted by the evil villain known as Harvey Two-face, who was once a police detective named Harvey Dent (Tommy Lee Jones) that turned to evil following a disfiguring chemical accident.  Unfortunately, the attack by Two-face occurs while the famed Grayson family is performing their trapeze act.  Three of them are killed, but one survived: the young Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell). Feeling responsible, Bruce takes Dick under his wing, but Dick doesn't want to stay there until Bruce shows Dick his huge collection of motorcycles.  In the meantime, one of Wayne Enterprises' employees, Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey), becomes increasingly delusional and transforms himself into the villain the Riddler.  Using a sophisticated device of his own design that allows him to send and receive thoughts directly from people's minds, the Riddler joins Two-face in an effort to control Gotham City and destroy Batman; but this time, Batman is not alone.  Begrudgingly, Batman accepts a partner: Dick Grayson as his faithful sidekick Robin (at the urging of Bruce's long-time butler Alfred, played by Michael Gough). <br /> <br />Though not as well-received as the first two Batman films, I rate \\"Batman Forever\\" with a respectable 3.5 out of 5 stars.  However, few people (including myself) found the fourth Batman film in any way entertaining.  In 1997, again under the direction of Joel Schumacher, Batman (this time played by George Clooney) and his sidekick Robin (Chris O'Donnel) must fight two new villains: the evil Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) who becomes the evil nature-loving Poison Ivy in the film \\"Batman & Robin\\".  This time, though, Batman & Robin have another helper: Commissioner Gordon's niece Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) who puts on a mask of her own to become Batgirl.  Unfortunately, with a mixture of terrible acting, poor direction, bad writing and a too-comical appearance, \\"Batman & Robin\\" was a truly awful film that earned a 1 out of 5 star rating in my book. <br /> <br />Hence, for the first four Batman films, I give a combined average rating of 3 out of 5 stars. If you are a true Batman aficionado, this is truly a good set of DVD's for you to own; but in my book, the best Batman film to date is the 2005 \\"Batman Begins\\", which is not part of this four-film set.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|This is one of my 5 star albums. Each song is awesome and unique and Josh sings wonderfully. <br /> If you liked any other music by QOTSA, then buy this one because you will probably love it.  <br />Don't miss out! Get ahold of Lullabies to Paralyze! <br />
B00028HBKM|4.0|I'm not religous so probably not as meaningful to me, but a good movie to watch. Very graphic scenes of torture though - not for the faint hearted. An example of how cruel humans can be towards each other
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I see that alot of people aren`t too thrilled with their latest release, all mainly because M. Shadows doesn`t scream? Excuse me? For all the ignorant people out there, he can`t because if he had continued singing/screaming the way he had like on \\"Waking the Fallen\\", he would`ve lost his voice by the time he hit 40. So they decided to continue on without the screaming. <br /> <br />And in my opinion I think it`s still a great hardcore metal album. I think it`s also really stupid how some people randomly decide to hate a band just because they`re on MTV or just become really more well known in general. Why is that? They`ve worked their asses off to get their name known and when they finally do, some \\"fans\\" decide to hate on them? These are probably the same kind of people who claim to have loved My Chemcial Romance BEFORE \\"Helena\\". Riiiiiight. I myself am not a big fan of MTV but that doesn`t mean I`m going to burn down their studio. Get real people and try to get an open mind on things.
B0000024YL|4.0|Peace, love, and great music. Let's face it, this stuff is immortal. Some of the best songs ever came from Simon & Garfunkel, and this compliation CD proves it.<br /><br />Simon & Garfunkel is a guilty pleasure of mine. Even though I'm into a wide range of music, I usually don't go for the lighter kind. But there's just something about that beautiful harmony caught between these two musicians. There's plenty of music out there to get us down and bummed out on life, but few bands actually have that power of puting a smile on our face just by playing a song, and S&G do it with perfection. If there's any band that should represent the true power of peace and love, it's these guys.<br /><br />The songlist is just about perfect. You get all of your favorite styles from this wonderful duo. To name of a few of my favorties, \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" is an upbeat classic sure to lift your mood. \\"For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her\\" is a heavenly, soft, romantic song played live with an acoustic guitar instead of a full band. \\"The Boxer\\" is a great hit of theirs, very catchy and powerful at the end. Another superb live track with only an acoustic to accompany them is \\"59th St Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)\\", which is definitely a spirit-lifter and alot of fun to hear because of its poppy harmony. \\"The Sound Of Silence\\" is another well-known hit, and certainly deserves the recognition with its poetic lyrics and memorable tune. Of course, \\"Bridge Over Trouble Water\\" -- possibly their most popular and arguably best song -- is included here as a live version with a full band. \\"Bookends Theme\\" is a sadly short song, but is absolutely superb nonetheless. \\"Homeward Bound\\", \\"I Am A Rock\\", and a few others give that finishing touch to the disc. There are a few tracks on here that I don't listen to very often, but for the most part \\"Greatest Hits\\" is an ideal CD for any Simon & Garfunkel fan.<br /><br />All in all, I feel any fan of the 60s folk/pop music should own this album. Unless you want to spend more money on a box set, this is perfect for your S&G needs. They're an excellent example of how far music can take us, and what we need more of in this world. Long live love!x set, this is perfect for your S&G needs. They're an excellent example of how far music can take us, and what we need more of in this world. Long live love!
B00006L83N|5.0|This is my first Sympohny X album and it certainly won't be my last.<br /><br />Being a big Dream Theater fan, I decided to check these guys out after being compared to DT tons of times. After checking out all their album on the web, I decided to make this my first. After buying it, I'm very impressed. I still like DT more, but these guys aren't too far behind either. This is possibly SX's heaviest and best album to date. Russell Allen is a great singer, and Mike Romeo is an amazing guitarist. Everyone else is this band is great, too (too lazy to remember their names). The epic title track alone is worth this album. Overall, a 5 star masterpiece, and a great introduction to this great band. Oh yeah, before Iforget, be sure to see these guys live since they rule live!<br /><br />The songs:<br /><br />1. Inferno (Unleash the Fire) 5/5 A great heavy song, great riff.<br /><br />2. Wicked 5/5 Also great, has an even better riff.<br /><br />3. Incantations of the Apprentice 5/5<br /><br />4. Accolade II 5/5<br /><br />5. King of Terrors 5/5 Very heavy.<br /><br />6. Turning 5/5<br /><br />7. Awakenings 5/5<br /><br />8. Oddyssey 6/5 Holy crap. What needs to be said this song that hasn't been said before? The best song on the album, and definitely one of their best. This song ALONE is enough to buy this album, enough to justify the cheesy, power metal-esque cover.<br /><br />So, if you like metal, this is an album that belongs in your collection. I also reccomend this to those new to Symphony X.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This CD is absolutely phoenomenal. I didn't realize how much of a Ray Charles fan I was until I saw the movie and heard so many songs I already knew. Getting the CD was a must. Mr. Charles certainly opened my eyes to a whole new genre. Don't wait. Buy it NOW!
B000B0WODA|5.0|Franz Ferdinand's debut was full of hooks, hooks, and hooks, and some pretty decent lyrics. I loved their album, but at best I gave it 4 stars. The slow songs weren't really that great, and some borded on annoying, while Take me Out and This Fire were some of the greatest songs. I heard in an interview, after the choice of colors would be green black and red, that this album would be darker and harder. Immediately I was excited- anyone who knows Weezer's history knows that Pinkerton was a darker album preceeding a huge debut, and that it was one of the best albums in the past 20 years. So, the day it came out I stumbled upon it and rushed home to put it in. <br /> <br />The lyrics are definatly improved from the last album- they made me laugh at least once in each song and made me shiver and crawl in others. I loved them all, and they break free from the repetitiveness of FF. <br /> <br />It starts off with some distortion and blasts off into the song 'The Fallen', which I am proud to say is one of my favorite songs ever, not just Franz's songs. It explores all areas of the band, and leaves a feeling so incredible I can't really describe it. <br /> <br />The Fallen- This song is crazy- an awesome intro and chorus, catchy bridge, and the lyrics are a parody of Jesus', except not really offensive. As I said before, this is probably my favorite song right now, and it deserves to be. <br /> <br />This Boy- A funny song with a catchy chorus and singable lyrics. Better than anything off the first cd and I bet you'll be singing 'I want a car' after this. <br /> <br />Walking Away- A ballad, except instead of a not appealing Auf Ashe, it has a catchy chorus, awesome lyrics, and great replay value. THIS is what a Franz ballad should be. <br /> <br />Elenor Put Your Boots On- This is like a Beatles-esque ballad, and not only that, but it is good. It has an acoustic guitar and piano, and really steers away from the guitars and synths, which really does a great job of making anall around better album. <br /> <br />Basically, every song on here is at least a 4. Many I would rate as 5's. The lyrics on this cd are awesome, and really take you away while staying true to the Franz style. <br /> <br />Also, to the reviewer who said there are no hooks in here, what? This album is overflowing with hooks, and you will find yourself dancing after a while to 'That Was Easy' and 'I'm Your Villian' (which I consider the equivalent of This Fire). Belive me, this album is worth buying, and boy am I glad I did.
B0009F2C34|5.0|The old one disc version is no longer in production. The two disc version is the only version you can buy of Endtroducing. Also for the record, the 2nd disc may not be as cohesive and incredible as the first disc, but that is because it's leftover cuts that didn't make the album. Those tracks are there for history and background into what went into make Endtroducing. In short, it is unfair to give this new release anything less than you would have given the old release, because the old one is no longer available, and it contains all of Endtroducing and some extraordinary extras.
B000002H5I|4.0|I bough this album for my girlfriend as she really like Tracy Chapman - I've just always been indifferent I guess.  However, after several car trips I have heard this album a few times and it isn't half bad.  \\"Fast Car\\" is the best song on the album and one you'll want to listen to several times.  Not a bad album at all.
B0009QZ4CE|5.0|a brief layoff, a solo album or two and a long a hello.  then, 1975, there's godbluff.  if you're reading this review, you're probably already interested.  if you are a casual progger, then you should look away.  there are no synths.  there are no solos.  there's only van der graaf.  sax, organ, drums, vox and some clavinet on this one.  and let me tell you, there's a lot of vox.  i'm currently replacing my old vdgg cds and buying the reissues.  this is one of the best.  buy it for the sound alone, but the bonus live tracks only add to the experience.  ph always said this was a band that bordered between chaos and control.  not only do the studio tracks affirm this; the live tracks underline it.  vdgg is a dangerous band.
B00005JO0J|4.0|It was pretty good for a series turned to movie...movie.  I was thoroughly impressed.  Now, I'm not sure why I liked the movie so much.  I don't know if it was because I really liked the series, or because the movie was indeed \\"just good\\" despite the short lived series.  Who knows.  I do know that the people I went to see the movie with, who had never watched the series, liked the movie as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it \\"babied\\" those who didn't watch the series or know anything about the series for too long.  If this had been the season premiere of Firefly, many things they showed you and talked about in this movie would have been editted out.  I was like, \\"yeah, we know this already, let's move on\\".  But being the fan I am of this series, I let it go and didn't let it ruin my experience.<br /><br />After the movie I asked, how was it that it blended science fiction, drama, romance and comedy so well together?  Very funny movie.  So good.  This is one of those movies you watch and don't feel like you wasted your money.  This time, the movie was actually better than the previews, an achievement in itself.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />Sure I wish for a Serenity 2, but I'm not certain it should be made.  This movie was made in such a way, I don't think it could be topped by another.  It's like when Michael Jorden retired, he should have stayed retired.  Joss Whedon may be very talented, but I think he should leave this series alone, for now.  I'll still like to read the books though.  I think this may be the last we see of anything Serenity for a long time on the screen, and that may be a good thing.  It further places the Firefly - Serenity ideal in the hearts of those who deem it a legend.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a Buffy fan, I considered the premiere of Firefly on network TV something of a consolation prize for the post-slayer era, and I approached it with caution, but not without hope, because I have faith in Joss Whedon's vision. I watched the premiere on TV and couldn't figure out what had gone wrong - had I missed three episodes? Was I just in a confused funk because Buffy was over? I just didn't get it and I couldn't believe Joss would introduce a series in such a user-unfriendly way. <br /> <br />I gave up quickly and it wasn't until a friend and fellow-Joss fan suggested I try again that I gave it any thought at all. We rented the entire series on DVD and lo and behold! A different pilot! A two-hour introduction to the characters and universe! What a good idea! Turns out Joss had planned it this way but the network took issue and had him air a later episode first. Silly network execs. What's the point of running a Joss Whedon series, whose main audience is likely going to be Joss Whedon and Buffy fans and then not listening to what he has to say? <br /> <br />Anyway, I LOVED the series - it's smart, deep, funny, well-written, well-played - the cast has  chemistry and comraderie and the stories have multi-cultural/multi-historical references and timeless lessons with metaphors that work and language that works overtime. Brilliant idea to use Chinese to curse on network TV, too. <br /> <br />Recently I purchased the whole series (one box) for my boyfriend, so he could get up to speed before Serenity was out. He only had to watch the pilot to enjoy the film, which was also wonderful. There are contradictions in plot between the series and the movie, but nothing so egregious that you can't chalk it up to a different retelling of the same story. It has a mythical quality, grounded in a mix of future and history that, as I said, gives it a timeless quality. We are what we are, and we probably always will be. <br /> <br />I guess it's not surprising that something of such high quality didn't survive on the air. Firefly can now take it's place alongside Freaks and Geeks, Sports Night and other short-lived but outstanding television series.
1878424319|5.0|Sometimes the simplest things carry the greatest power with them. Don Miguel Ruiz's book, \\"The Four Agreements\\" is one of those simple things in life. The four agreements he presents to the reader are so simple that they may almost strike you as funny at first (I won't go in to repeat them since they've been mentioned enough in other reviews). But once you begin to read the book, you feel as if it was written for you: the scripted behaviors and answers we have for things, the way we carry our lives and how we suffer as a result of it.<br /><br />His recommendations provide a fantastic practical framework that can direct you into a life of fulfillment where you will be armed with tools to spread peace and happiness around you while you are at peace within yourself. However, the simplicity of his four pieces of advice can be deceiving. Our habits are so deeply hardwired that you will find yourself falling into the same mistakes again, even while trying not to. But the greatest reward the book offers comes in the discovery and the trip it presents to you, where each step brings you closer to an ideal place of peace and happiness.
0553274503|5.0|I read this as a short story when I was a child, and I read it again just recently as a novel. Flowers for Algernon is an absorbing story. It challenges your perception of intelligence and makes you think about what makes a person worthwhile. You cry.<br /><br />Flowers for Algernon is at its best as a short story- it's a concise and powerful story with intimate implications. The novel seems padded, and it loses some of its punch-but if you read it as a welcome addition to the Flowers for Algernon canon, the meandering, wavering structure of the plot will provide some interesting insights into Charlie's mind. The only problem is that Charlie is transformed into a less sympathetic character when you begin to know him better.  For the tear-jerker that it is, it's best to still really love Charlie all the way through the book.<br /><br />If you haven't yet read the short story, go read that first. Then let the story percolate in your brain for months or years; after that, read the novel as a side trip or a return to a study. It works best that way..<br /><br />...and grab your tissues either way.
B00005JNQS|1.0|i hated this movie it was sooo bad ... it waas not funny... the  puns were stupid ... robert williams made a mistake by being in these movie ... the plot was stupid... there was 3 seconds of funny never c this music
0792844890|4.0|I wish they hadn't shown they knew it was all a movie. Airplane the movie did great without letting you know they knew it was a movie. I loved a lot about Spaceballs. Joan Rivers (by voice) providing the Jewish C3PO lady is good. She said a mini-model of that on  a chain on QVC. I love the mini Alienesque monster singing \\"Hello My Baby, Hello My Honey\\" and so much else too.
B000002UB3|5.0|Brilliant. That's all. Listen to it, I can't do justice by writing about it.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is the best Depeche Mode album to date and my #1 favorite album of all time. I must have listened to this album over 2000 times over the years. This album actually uses a lot of guitars and was probably the turning point were DM went more towards guitar based sounds and less synth based. But the balance is real good on this album, with enough electro sounds to make the synth heads happy. <br /> <br />The track \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" is a masterpiece and probably their best track and most favorite of their fans if a vote was to be collected. Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys said that DM's \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" is \\"the best pop song ever written.\\"  Every single song on the album is a 10 out of 10. Specially good were the singles. \\"Personal Jesus\\" is a cathy beat driven track with chantings of \\"reach out, Toouch Faith\\". \\"Policy of Truth\\" is a guitar driven catchy track. \\"World in My Eyes\\" starts out with a very catchy synth bassline that uses different velocities of the bass notes that continues to the end of the song. This basline os so good that if they looped this bassline for an our, I would not get tired of it. \\"Halo\\" was a single only in UK and uses a similar bassline to \\"World in my Eyes\\". <br /> <br />Do not forget the single B-sides that came out of this album. Specially good were \\"Sea of Sin\\" and \\"Happiest Girl\\" from \\"World in my Eyes\\" single and \\"Dangerous\\" from \\"Personal Jesus\\" single, all of which could have easily been an album track.
B0007P3582|1.0|Let me see if I got this straight, this bubbling idiot got shot has two cds and thinks that he should be bigger than Samuel Jackson in  his sorry movie! what? Your music is okay but the rap is so weak  we need a translator to know what the hell you are saying.  You are so hardcore but yet you live in one of the best cities in Connecticut.  You throw at Jarule, Fat Joe, Nas and Jadakiss but you can't hold a candle to them.  You know your first problem, hooking up with the west coast. Soon the bubbling rap will get old, then what? back to the streets.<br /><br />This cd sucks, like everything else produced by the idiots Eminem (just out of rehab), Dr. Dre (has been)and by someone who actually  calls himself 50cents.<br /><br />Your next cd should be called: \\"What Fries with That?\\" (your next job)
B0007CNXUU|4.0|Finding Neverland offers chills, tears, and magic. It's not an epic story- it's a very intimate one. The movie's not clever or snappy or dangerous. It's personal in scope, and it offers thousands of shades of gray in what ultimately becomes a sympathetic and close examination of some of the more tender sides of the human spirit. Many films out there attest to the power of imagination, but this one shows-vividly-how incredibly poignant, colorful, and vivid the mind of the truly imaginative can be.<br /><br />There are characters and plot points that are predictable, but the movie more than makes up for that by showering you in goosebumps.  We've all seen versions of the theme before, but this one is a whimsical, gently rendered affirmation of its central message: \\"Believe in magic; it's good for you.\\"
B00005LMBK|5.0|Yahoo!! I love Gorillaz so much! they are my favorite band ever! this cd is great and it hasen't left my cd player. their music is so addicting its like being on drugs--only its more safer (i would never take drugs)yes i am a total fangirl and i love all the songs on this cd. Plus I have a crush on the lead singer, 2-D (yay! im one of his fangirls) I would say that this cd is better than their demon days cd, which is also very good (i have both of their cds) Go out and get this cd, trust me you will love it.
0783225849|5.0|What more can I say about this film? If it hadn't been for the original Psycho, I wouldn't be interested in the stalker/slasher films that would follow. Please pardon the \\"morbidity\\" and maybe \\"partial, if not complete, blasphemy\\" behind this but, thank God for the late and ex-real life psycho Ed Gein! Why? In my opinion, without Gein, there'd be no Psycho, let alone the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deranged, Unhinged, Dressed To Kill, Homicidal, and Don't Go In The House. As a fan of \\"underground\\" and \\"old school\\" horror, in my opinion, \\"there's 'something,' dare I say 'charismatic,' about cross-dressing and horror.\\" Also, in my opinion, the original Psycho is the \\"Beatles and/or the Rolling Stones\\" of horror films! Thank you Mr. or Sir Alfred Hitchcock! RIP!

Talk about paying your dues for a band you like, I left all those shows black and blue all over.<br /><br />Look, I liked Van Halen too - A LOT, saw them at the US Fest in '83 when I was just a pup, but DLR lost the edge, and the rest of the band while great, I mean Eddie on guitar forget about it, but they brought in Sammy and it was done, OV-ER.

0790740443|4.0|Soldier is a movie that bombed at the box office.  Made for a reported $75 million, it didn't make back a quarter of that.  Critics on [...] gave it a 2 percent consensus, which makes it one of the worst movies ever as fair as the critics were concerned.  I have to ask why?    Like most of the other people here on the \\"Zon,\\" the movie accomplished what it was looking to and did it believably.  There were no notable bad actors, overly bad scenes, the plot was thin, but fine for most action movies.  The only thing I can think of is that critics just don't get science fiction as well.  They more understand the hundredth review they do on a revenge theme, or a crime and punishment theme, or more character driven personalized type of saving my daughter type of action movie. Throw a spaceship in and they are lost!                In a lot of ways I thought soldier made a good point on how we handle our military today.  It should be observed that soldiers returning from long stints fighting terrorists, and then trying to re-enter society is going to have problems. It also may have shown some light on the often unthinking, unfeeling attitude you see with how the government treats its soldiers.    Despite the subtle politics, Soldier is a good action movie.  Much of the movie played out in a similar vein like movies such as Die Hard, and Rambo that fill the action venues.  Kirk Russell is convincing as a trained killing machine that no personal ambitions outside of doing his duty as a soldier and doing it well.  When asked to describe his thoughts, feelings, he answers \\"Fear and Discipline, Sir.\\"    I'm a science fiction and an action movie fan.  I still doubt I would have committed so much money to a movie with nothing special to attract larger audiences.  This is a movie that should have been made a little more on the cheap.  When I saw the production values on TV, I wondered why I had never heard of this movie.  Probably because the movie had little fanfare, and may have opened, then closed in the same week.  Still it's a good movie, and I'm glad to see the other reviewers here at Amazon, know what they like.
0553573403|5.0|This book made me so mad that I threw it across the room. Then I picked it up, forgave it for breaking my heart, and kept reading. Oh my Lord! It's so... rich, so complex, and so utterly absorbing. It's a cruel book. I know that authors are supposed to throw stones at their characters, but George R.R. Martin uses trebuchets to level boulders at babies-and it all makes sense. Read this book and you'll shatter, temporarily, into a thousand pieces-but you'll be so caught up in the intrigue and adrenaline that you won't be able to stop reading. It's really very, very good. Pick this book up. Read it-but don't let your bright eight-year-old child read it. The nightmares would keep them up for ages.
B000000W5P|1.0|As other reviews indicate, the music on this CD is awesome.   <br />HOWEVER, the medium on which they sell it is ABSOLUTELY nasty and will not burn to Itunes, will not play on my Sony (PC) CD player, nor will the copied files upload or play on Windows Media Player, Media Jukebox or Itunes.  So you buy the music and do not get to use it. <br />Programs won't even play the MUSIC purchased on this album from a networked drive that does recognize it.  This MUSIC is in some kind of toxic format. <br />DRM control on this MUSIC appears to be here for the protection of those starving artists.  Nonetheless, I'd sure like to use the music that I paid for.  This was my last Amazon/Stones purchase.  Why buy MUSIC that you can't use the way you want to use it?
0689865384|5.0|So, I took this out of the library thinking it looked a bit weird was not at all sure whether I would like it or not. However, it's a great book with a really unique and interesting plot. The only niggling worry at the back of my mind is that from my experience, authors that write their books really quickly and write an entire series at once tend not to have such great books. An example being the Daughters of the moon series. But Scott Westerfeld has recently written the entire series of Uglies, Pretties, and Specials, the Midnighter series and another new book, Peeps, which I just got from the library. So far all of them have been great though, (pretties and specials haven't been published yet). I've enjoyed all of his books even though he must really write them quickly. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to Uglies. This book is great because it takes a interesting spin on prevalent issues in society today, like the need to be perfect and pretty. In this book \\"everyone who is normal is ugly\\" and everyone has extensive plastic surgery at 16 that completley changes their appearance and makes them pretty.  This book was great, after finishing it, I kept thinking about it and can't wait untill Pretties comes out. <br /> <br />Give it a chance and I'm almost certain you'll enjoy it.

Talk about paying your dues for a band you like, I left all those shows black and blue all over.<br /><br />Look, I liked Van Halen too - A LOT, saw them at the US Fest in '83 when I was just a pup, but DLR lost the edge, and the rest of the band while great, I mean Eddie on guitar forget about it, but they brought in Sammy and it was done, OV-ER. It pained me, I tried to like it, but it was like an old girlfriend who was really hot and then you see her 10 years later and she's fat, and you're like damn, wish I had just let the memory of that one lie.<br /><br />Say goodbye, goodbye to RATM, goodbye to S.G., goodbye to V.H. It doesn't last and that's because it isn't supposed to. Think bonfire, starts small, gets really big and hot, and then it's all downhill from there.<br /><br />Young friends, this is the ageing process and it's sucks, but that doesn't make it stop. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THIS GROUPS MUSIC, YES IT WILL BE PAINFUL, BUT LET . . . IT  . . . GO ! I'm sorry but it's over, hopefully you enjoyed it while it lasted, and if you didn't, well that's the good thing about rock bands, they're like the city bus, another one will be along in 20 minutes or so.other one will be along in 20 minutes or so.

B00006FXB6|5.0|This album is the pinnacle of the mountain that is Queens of the Stone Age.  Quite a collection of talent in one place and forever...Josh Homme...his killer guitar tones and monster riffs and smooth vocals (did I mention the song writing)...Nick Oliveri's manic bass skills....Troy Van Der whatever adds great dimension with his guitar work...Dave Grohl smashing the heads right off the drums...Mark Lanegen's vocals (the harmonies between Lanagen and Homme over these songs is the cream filling of your favorite dessert...the dessert of desert rock). <br /> <br />I was fortunate to catch Queens on tour in Denver just after this was released...man, they delivered the goods...totally blew me away..it was the most righteous musical experience EVER  (see 'em at a small venue so the sonic ferocity permiates your very soul)..they played nerely every song on this album plus some of their older stuff... <br /> <br />The opener MILLIONAIRE shreds right out of the gate (There's a slower version of this song on Desert Session Vol 4/5 where the lyrics are easier to understand...it's good too but this one is the best...this song is also on the XXX soundtrack) <br /> <br />NO ONE KNOWS really showcases the talents of Homme as a song writer and guitarist...the quirky riff in an odd time proves there are none like the Queens out there. <br /> <br />SONG FOR THE DEAD...one of the best songs on the album (and in the rock universe)...here everyone really showcases their talents..it starts with Homme's wicked riffage (and tone), then becomes punctuated with Grohls brutal drum attacks...the whole band kicks in..pause...guitars trade licks..and then they take off again...this a titan among rock songs... <br /> <br />THE SKY IS FALLING...is a marvel of textured and layered guitars... on top of it all is Homme's and Lanagan's sweet inteplay of vocals. <br /> <br />GO WITH THE FLOW...is a fun and really accesible song on the album...the lead guitar is really smooth and seductive (the video is really cool too) <br /> <br />DO IT AGAIN...this song is really in the Queens mold of older albums...it's a song about sex..in fact according to Homme  90% of the songs are about sex.... <br /> <br />GOD IS IN THE RADIO...this was a song Homme wrote while with KYUSS (get SKY VALLEY today) but didn't fit with the band's musical direction at the time...but it's a bad-a$$ song  (...\\"you come back..another day...and do no wrong\\"...)  the solo is the mightiest of all solos on the album. <br /> <br />SONG FOR THE DEAF is just epic (especially live). <br /> <br />This album is their best..hands down...get the version with the DVD (you get to see them in studio and at early shows with Grohl...plus Homme directs Grohl on some of the songs...the DVD is really insightful). <br /> <br />Just click 'buy now' so your life can be better.

B0007TKH66|5.0|This is much better than I heard it was as a show. It has a strong first season. It might hard to explain some things that go on here that supposedly happend before the first star trek series but besides that it is very good throughtout the first season. The main enemy in the first season is the Suluvond and the temporal cold war. You have the intorduction of the Kliogns  looking like they are in the later series ds9 and voyager as descpecpancy but it doesn't interfer with any story lines except they are greater villans in the first star trek series then they are in this one or later series.
B00065GX64|5.0|Peter Lorre is the psychopathic child murderer who turns a whole German city upside down trying to track him down. The underworld gets in on the chase after the police, in doing their job so thoroughly, harass them so much they can't conduct business as usual (pretty funny when you think about it). Thus we have a race between the cops and the crooks to see who'll find Lorre first. The crooks win after getting a tip from a blind balloon seller (the blind leading the blind?).<br /><br />Any other director might have been satisfied with this ironic satire, but Fritz Lang goes after more: Lorre is what really interests him, the workings of a psychotic killer, the uncontrollable drives, the fear, the guilt. And Lorre, sweating profusely, eyes bulging, makes us feel what it must be like to be trapped in who he is. That is what makes this film so memorable. A great movie. Definitely worth a watch.
B000AV2G3I|4.0|Beware: Some songs have been re-mixed.  Whatever Gets You Thru the Night has had the drums mixed out leaving only handclaps for an example.   <br /> <br />Also, the track list on the back of the CD case does not indicate alternate versions are used on some songs or indicate that at least one song is a duet.   <br /> <br />Also, the booklet is lacking.  It would have been nice to have at least a short essay to put the different periods in Johns' life in perspective relating to when the albums were recorded. IE: the Primal Scream era, the \\"Lost Weekend\\", and the House Husband era to name a few.  It is not like these are all cheerful love songs, so to put them in order would focus more on where he was at the time and why some are so bitter and biting.   <br /> <br />A listing of who was in the various bands listed would be cool as well.   <br /> <br />Additionally, evidently the songs have been re-copyrighted because the copyright dates listed in the booklet are about 30 years later than when the songs were recorded.  Not asking for the Billboard charting history, but some background and actual recording dates would be nice for someone experiencing John for the first time.   <br /> <br />My nephew would probably get a kick out of this CD and this information would be cool for a 13 year old.   <br /> <br />I agree with other commentors that chronological order would be better.  Come on Yoko.  Quit criticizing Paul, and focus on Johns' history and promote his legacy.   <br /> <br />5 stars for the music.

B000AA305M|5.0|I heard a review of David Gray's new CD on NPR and was so taken by it that I immediately ordered it.  I have been listening to it for the past 3 hours while I put in some time at work on a Saturday afternoon. I can honestly say that it is excellent.  \\"The One I Love,\\" \\"Nowa and Always\\" and \\"Life in Slow Motion\\" are even better than I was expecting.   <br /> <br />However, actually being able to listen to this CD has been an adventure I was not expecting.  Fortunately, I decided to check out other reviews on Amazon before sending in a repair request to my IT department staff to replace the CD ROM in my PC.  I now realize that there is nothing wrong with my PC/CD player.  Seems like rather primitive strategy on someone's part to limit access to this beautiful music.  Unlike my other favorite (and legally purchased) CD's, I guess I won't be able to make permanent copies to keep in my car and office which will limit my listening.
B0002YLC24|5.0|\\"Before Sunset\\" is the sequel to 1995's \\"Before Sunrise,\\" which followed Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) on a magical night in Vienna.  Nine years later, our protagonists are older, wiser, and more wounded by love and relationships, desperately clinging to the idea of how their lives would have changed if they had met each other as planned six months after their first encounter.<br /><br />Jessie is in Paris promoting his new book at Shakespeare and Co. bookstore, on the last leg of a whirlwind publicity tour of ten cities in twelve days, when Celine shows up at the question and answer session. Floored, Jessie slips out with Celine for a quick coffee, which predictably turns into a late afternoon bathed in Paris's charms and beauty: a bateau mouche (boat ride) down the Seine (\\"It's for tourists!\\" Celine protests weakly), walking through quiet, manicured gardens, sharing a coffee in a typical Paris caf&eacute;, and finally, listening to Nina Simone in Celine's charming (and cluttered apartment).<br /><br />The late afternoon light bathes Paris in a hazy film of romance and possibility. The locations, from narrow Parisian sidestreets, cruising under ponts (bridges) on the Seine, to landmarks such as Notre Dame, are stunning, and seem much more alive than did Vienna in the first film. Jessie and Celine have grown up: Jessie is married with children, and Celine is in a relationship with a war photojournalist, but the initial attraction in Vienna is still there, only tempered with anger and bitterness at life's unfairness. Much of the film is spent in arguments about the cruelty of love, trapped in loveless relationships, and giving up on the hope of ever meeting \\"the one.\\" This film is much more grounded in reality, and as such, is missing a bit of the feel-good romance from \\"Before Sunrise.\\" There is also much more graphic dialogue concerning sex and sex acts in frank, frequently explicit language, although no sex occurs in the film.<br /><br />The ending, at least, is much more open-ended and positive than its predecessor, and Ethan Hawke mentions in the behind-the-scenes feature that he hopes to follow Celine and Jessie down the road, perhaps every ten years or so. The DVD comes with the theatrical trailer and a ten-minute behind-the-scenes feature which shows limited filming on location and interviews with Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and director Richard Linklater. Bonus: the French-language track was dubbed in Qu&eacute;bec rather than France. (For someone from Qu&eacute;bec, there's poetic justice in hearing Parisians speak with a (loathed) Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois accent!)

B00005BL2A|5.0|Exciter was the first Depeche Mode album that I bought and it is one of my favorites. Dave's voice is absolutely beautiful. The whole album is so soothing. I like to play it at night to put me to sleep or when I'm driving by myself to clear my head. If you like Exciter, I suggest you check out Ultra next.
B0001LJC2K|3.0|I thought I'd be all original and compare them to Radiohead, but seems a lot of people on here have beat me to it /  lol<br /><br />Anyway, Muse is awesome, definitely like a more rockin', less subtle version of Radiohead, and I actually like them better.  'Stockholm Syndrome' is an excellent track and will give you an idea of how energetic and bad-ass these guys can be.  Maybe it's not for strict hard-rock people, but fans who like variety should get into Muse.
B00005QAPH|5.0|8 1/2 is Federico Fellini's most famous film, and for good reason. The hardest thing for any director to do is make the film following their big hit because one always feels they have to top it. La Dolce Vita (1960) was Fellini's awakening to the world of international cinema, and he was left bemused on what his next project should be. So in one of the boldest and most brilliant moves in cinema history Fellini made a film about the troubles of making that film. 8 1/2 is full of nice imagery, both real and surreal, and the inner emotions of the director come flying out in wonderous scene after scene. The human psyche has never been shown so artistically, and Fellini is able to balance the outrageous moments with more quiet moments in the film to create a thoroughly engrossing, dramatic, and fantastic film masterwork.
B00008BXJ6|4.0|If you like this type of music, you'll love this album. Sure, a lot of it is a bit childish and sex-obsessed, but the sheer, energy, joy and power of it go a long way toward making up for that. For me, the all-time classic A Long Way to the Top is worth the cost of the album alone. This is Bon and Acker Dacker at their absolute peak. It may seem a strange thing to say about an AC DC song, but I actually find the bits with Bon playing the bagpipes quite moving - it's a man paying respect to his heritage, in a way that is just pure joy. Particularly the part where the guitar riff and bagpipes 'play off' each other. A unique rock 'n' roll moment. The song is about how hard the rock 'n' roll lifestyle can be, but (and this is one of the things I really like about AC DC) it doesn't have a moment of self-pity - just total, no-nonsense, hard rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br />The other tracks I love most - The Jack (wonderful, bluesey, but still hard, and very witty), High Voltage (if this one doesn't grab you and make your heart beat faster - check your pulse, you're possibly clinically dead), and TNT (never has the word 'explosive' been more appropriate to describe a song. Pure Bon, and pure attitude.) <br /> <br />
B000AJJNPY|5.0|After hearing one of their pieces on an NPR compilation album, I bought all of their albums.  I'm new to their work, and to this whole genre (Post-Rock), so we will see how I feel about their albums in a few months from now.  I've enjoyed all 4 of their albums.  At the moment, I like Takk best.<br /><br />I've recently heard some other good Post-Rock groups, like Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai, and GY!BE - and so far I give the highest ratings to Sigur Ros, for the level of their artistry.  Maybe someday their work will be included with classical music - time will tell.<br /><br />Added thoughts in 2007... After hearing several other Post Rock groups, including Andrew Bird, Rachel's, Mum, and M83, I still like Sigur Ros best.<br /><br />They reach high, and succeed well for the most part, IMO.<br />The themes I find in their music include: nostalgia for innocence; finding innocence; spiritual awareness; purification; transformation.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|These guys, Avenged Sevenfold, ar pretty cool, especially if you, like me, are a big fan of curretn metal stuff as well as the 80's best, such as Iron Maiden and similar acts.<br /><br />Avenged Sevenfold have a lot of different styles that they roll up into one.  There's something for everyone here; tho i actually thought the first two tracks were the weakest.  Favorites of mine are the frantic 'Bat Country', likewise 'Sidewinder'.  'Stength Of The World' is a cool little epic song and even has a western-movie-theme at the beginning which really got me into the song.  If you sample some cuts from the album i'm sure you'll be able to decide for yourself if Avenged Sevenfold are for you or not, but my opinion is that this album is one of the most intelligent selections a discriminating metal-head can make.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|Blow-Up is another one of Antonioni's ambigious and ambitious films. Not many directors can carve out a lasting career on films with no substantial plots, but Antonioni has done it with style. Blow-Up has an intersting premise that never finds a solid conclusion, which is it's real appeal. The film's meandering style is at times interesting, and other times tedious. Antonioni is famous for having changed normal film grammar with L'Avventura (1960), but in Blow-Up the style wears a little thin by the end. Swinging London is nicely photographed, the colors and fashion are bold, and David Hemmings is perfect as the disenchanted photographer. Antonioni's creative use of a possible murder plot, and his examination of reality are well concieved. The only real problem in the film is the ending moment that Antonioni dubbed \\"his moment.\\" It just doesn't work and comes off as a little silly.

B000667FN8|5.0|This Cd is very good. Simply put. The band's sound has occured much more on this record. Although, I did like the first record more. I do think though that SP should bring back some of they're more energetic songs. I'm all for the whole \\"maturing\\" thing, but common. Some of us WANT an immature group of twenty-something year olds. Maybe not neccicarily immature, but, more fun.  <br /> <br />Shut Up!: 10/10 I absoulutly love this song.

Good beat though. <br /> <br />Promise: 9/10 Lovely beat, cliched lyrics. AWESOME guitar solo. <br /> <br />One: 4/10 Im sorry, I love the guys but, please shut up. <br /> <br />Untitled: 9/10 You would think they could come up with a title. Very moving song. Beautiful.

Send more music like that.
B00000634J|4.0|My favorite rock album has always been Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle\\" (herein \\"E Street\\") - with its sounds and smells of hot summer nights in the inner city, and trips to the Asbury Park Boardwalk to cool off.  E Street gets its strength and energy from the mix of our hometowns and old neighborhoods - and from a very talented band.    I remember the controversies of the late 60s and early 70s, centering on Yoko Ono's influence on the Beatles breakup, because of her developing relationship with John Lennon - she was always a woman of strong will with an ego and creative energies of her own.  Beatles fans on both sides of the Atlantic wanted to set her afire at the stake for stealing Johnny's heart, for the couple's unconventional lifestyle, and for their newly dissonant music and performances.  I heard only the controversies - seldom John and Yoko's music.  In listening to it now, on the \\"Lennon Legend,\\" it's difficult to hold back tears -- for an early, untimely death, and especially for the youthful idealism and music beating in his heart.  The vision here is much broader than seen from an E Street perspective; and it is also more unashamedly personal and intimate.      There may have been controversies; but there were also happy family days - weekend outings to San Francisco, with a playful father flying a toy airplane for their beloved son.  And if we fault Yoko for breaking up rock history's legendary band, then we must also credit her for the emotional and musical growth of her husband thereafter.  The CD is a beautiful anthology - you won't like all tracks; but gut it out - because the good stuff is \\"world class,\\" as most of you already know.  The music's subject matter, special effects and percussion, controversial 25 - 30 years ago, are in harmony today; and Yoko's \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over),\\" is now a holiday favorite.  Right on, Yoko-chan - we are with you for the rest of the journey.
B00005JOGU|4.0|I've always thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman was a wonderful actor.  And this film, which will probably win him an Oscar nomination, really brings out his talent.  He's cast as Truman Capote, the eccentric writer who became famous for his book \\"In Cold Blood\\".  At that time, Capote was already well known for \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", and was a writer for the New Yorker.  Highly intelligent and an eccentric, he was public about his lifestyle and was known for his exaggerated effete mannerisms and self absorption.<br /><br />The film is the story of his obsessive research for \\"In Cold Blood\\" and his relationship with the murderers of a Kansas farm family in 1959.  Chris Cooper is cast as the policeman in town who allows Capote access to the arrested men.  Catherine Keener is cast Nelle Harper Lee, who wrote \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\".  She a dear friend of Capote's since childhood and traveled with him to help him with his research.  She and Capote smoke a lot of cigarettes and drink a lot of martinis.<br /><br />Capote was instrumental in helping the killers get postponements and reprieves after they were convicted.  This went on for five long years during which time Capote became more and more devoted to one of them, Perry Smith, played by Clifton Collins, Jr.  Their relationship was complex because if Perry admitted too many details, he would be re-enforcing the fact that he committed the crime. I applaud the director, Bennett Miller, for being able to capture these multifaceted elements of each of the characters.<br /><br />This is a really fine film.  I see many awards in its future.<br /><br />But then, why was I bored?  The whole film was only 90 minutes long and I must have dosed off a half dozen times.  Perhaps it was just too subtle for my taste.  After I got to understand Capote's character, the rest of the film dragged.  There was also no surprise about the outcome because I was aware of the actual story.  So therefore, ever though I do recommend Capote, I cannot give it the rave reviews that I think it deserves.  I suggest you do see Capote though.  And make up your own mind.mend Capote, I cannot give it the rave reviews that I think it deserves.  I suggest you do see Capote though.

B0009NCQJ6|5.0|Had heard the title track to this album on a radio station a few weeks back, but was driving in traffic at the time. It took a couple of days to find this album, then just had to have it.<br /><br />Had never heard of Bond before (am I culturally deprived?), so cannot comment on their earlier releases, but this album knocked my socks off, so to speak. Then I played the DVD side for a close friend who sings and usually listens to female vocals. She was quite favorably impressed, and we ended up listening to the audio side of this double-sided DualDisc a few times. It became more enjoyable each time we heard it, the way we wish all albums were.<br /><br />Bond is a stunningly attractive female string quartet made up of Haylie Ecker, Tania Davis, Gay-Yee Westeroff, and Eos (who has no last name). They are based in the UK, are in their mid-twenties, and each has strong classical music training (found most of this from their bios on their Website). Their music seems to be an exciting and original blend of classical, world rhythms and lively dance beats. But underneath it all, one can easily recognize that all of the members of this quartet have a deep love and understanding of classical music.<br /><br />There's not a single mediocre or bad track on this album, and though some reviewers have commented that certain tracks were better on some earlier releases, this one was enough to convince this listener that purchasing more of their prior releases.<br /><br />Enough said - on to the tracks.<br /><br />Victory: Stunning - what a great way to start this album. Strong and brilliant, with a polished orchestral background that blends well with their strings.<br /><br />Explosive: Lives up to its name - truly explosive - and wait until you see the extremely creative and original performance on the DVD side!<br /><br />Fuego: Spanish for \\"fire,\\" and it lives up to its title. Evocative of the Victory track, but with a faster pace.<br /><br />Viva!: This track starts off with the quartet performing acoustically... and one can hear the strong Vivaldi classical base, then it gets into an almost-joyous dance remix sound. Another bonus will be when view the DVD side that opens in a bullfight arena - joyous sound.<br /><br />Shine: Lovely track, slightly different from the others. Seems to have an Indian ambiance, yet is still a strong offering.<br /><br />Wintersun: Fast-paced, an exciting mixture of instrumental and dance rhythm.<br /><br />Scorchio: Slight break from previous tracks, and it fits in well with a strong opening then going to an easier, softer pace.<br /><br />Duel: Understand that this track is a string duel\\" between Eos and Haylie, and it's probably one of the best tracks on this CD. Would love to see this in a video.<br /><br />Gypsy Rhapsody: Lives up to its title, with a definite gypsy theme. Really rounds out this album.<br /><br />Caravan: If you're a classical or jazz music listener, then you'll either love or hate their rendition of this one. This listener loved it.<br /><br />Sugarplum: Young or old, you recognize their delightful adaptation from Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker.\\" Familiar, yet original.<br /><br />Carmina: Another that classical music fans will recognize, Bond's adaptation of \\"O Fortuna\\" from Carl Orff's \\"Carmina Burana.\\" This was a wonderful way to end this CD, and this listener must confess to having run this track on repetitive replay on more than one occasion.<br /><br />The DVD side is an excellent bonus. Ran this DVD on a variety of systems, from component surround sound to a PC equipped with surround sound software and hardware, and found the results to be quite pleasing in all instances. The music videos are outstanding, and seem to be mastered quite well. As with most Surround Sound DVDs, you will possible have to tweak your individual settings to get the most out of this disc. As they say, when it comes to stereo equipment or computer hardware, take the time to RTFM (Read That Fine Manual) - enoughsaid on this.<br /><br />There's a handy discography on the DVD side as well, handy for \\"Bond Newbies\\" like this reviewer to determine which album to purchase next.<br /><br />This quartet offers the kind of music that will please many listeners from ten to those in their sixties. I know, because my 10-year-old son immediately liked most of the tracks (especially \\"Victory,\\" \\"Viva!,\\" \\"Explosive\\"), and he really enjoyed the music videos on the DVD side.<br /><br />This is a CD that will appeal to most open-minded music fans. Check out the sample tracks here and find out for yourself, but they don't do justice to the range or quality of sound on the DualDisc CD/DVD.

There can hardly be a reader of any nationality, any age or any reading persuasion who is not aware of a rough plot outline which is at once extraordinarily simple yet sweeping in scope and grandeur - nothing less than the continuing quest to find The Holy Grail! Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, the chief curator of the Louvre and grand-master of the centuries old secret society, The Priory of Sion, has been found brutally murdered. His grand-daughter, cryptologist Sophie Neveu, and author/symbologist, Robert Langdon, follow an exciting and ingenious trail of clues intended to direct them to the final resting place of the real grail, the remains of Mary Magdalene. Bezu Fache, captain of the Central Directorate Judicial Police, is hard on their heels throughout the novel, believing them guilty of this murder plus the gruesome slaying of the three second level senechaux of the Priory's command structure.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is fictional! But its runaway popularity seems based on the controversial interpretation of the history of the grail and all the surrounding issues - the Priory of Sion, the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, the contention that the Roman Catholic Church has been suppressing the truth about the role of Mary Magdalene in the life of Jesus Christ for two centuries and the interpretation of religious symbolism in art and architecture. Are Brown's interpretations of his research accurate? Is the history of the suppression of this information by the Roman Catholic Church correct? I'll leave that judgment to people who are much more clever than I. Suffice it to say that Brown has an extraordinary ability to weave his version of the historical background completely seamlessly into his story and make it just as gripping and compelling as the murder mystery itself!<br /><br />The historical writing is exquisite! As a thriller, Brown has composed a taut, compelling, proverbial page-turner! And, what a bonus, all that is accompanied by descriptive detail and character development that can stand proudly beside the output of any author that I'm familiar with.<br /><br />Unless you're a scholar and a medieval historian, don't try to judge it! Just go out and get a copy and read it!roverbial page-turner!

0790729369|5.0|I just watched this movie again for probably the 50th time. I must say I rarely enjoy watching love stories, but this movie is about so much more. Forget all the reviews from those of you that only see the immoral side of this movie because of the extra-marital affair. If the truth be known, the same ones that criticize have probably longed all of their lives for the type of love and passion that this movie unfolds. When I first saw this movie with a friend of mine over 10 years ago, it touched me so deeply i wanted to go back and watch it alone, which I did. Since then I get so emotional, I regret ever turning it on. This movie is one of the most beautiful love stories ever written. It is deep on a level that most people can surely relate to, but many would never open their minds and acknowledge their true passionate side to admit it. There is nothing dirty or immoral about this movie. So what, the affair maybe was wrong, but it was REAL, and it was BEAUTIFUL! This movie is for all of us that have a very strong passionate side to us, and never get to truly release it and be the real woman many of us long to be with that special man who recognizes it and knows how to give it back and make us feel loved in a way that no other man could ever make us feel.
0596007124|5.0|This is the first book on Design Patterns where I really \\"got\\" it.  I've read other books, and thought I understood them, but I really didn't - not deeply.  This book really helped me to develop a deep understanding of Design Patterns, how and when to use them and in particular, how they relate to object oriented programming principles.  I really like that the authors don't assume you understand everything about object oriented programming before reading this book, like a lot of other books do.  And the fun style of the book just made me want to keep reading, which made learning much more enjoyable.
1590581814|5.0|When I first opened the pages of Drive, I really didn't know what to expect? When you read about the plot, it comes off rather dull, about a person who drives, that's all they do. But in the end, I came away a winner. The character of Driver is intriguing, mysterious, and gratifying in a philosophical sort of way. You can't help but like him, for his simple thoughts and observations about the experiences he goes through. This is a highly recommended read and if you like this check out: The Man in My Basement by Walter Mosley.
B0009WFFS6|1.0|My friend bought this and I watched it last night with him. This is absolutely the lamest dvd ever produced. I know from Cream and not even a nostalgic notion nor even a serious flashback could lead me to appreciate this concert. If you think this is a good dvd, then I have a bridge I would like to sell you in Brooklyn. A Madison Square Garden Concert?....please...call National Security and tell them that terrorists are coming in the form of a geritol generation attack of banality. Perhaps we should raise the terror alert to orange.
0975991477|4.0|I have just completed reading this book which was so refreshing and exciting. I think the book has made a good case to challenge the Newtonian approach to science and posits a case for considering energy as the source of matter. This means that what we see is more then matter and therefore the possibilities are infinite. Spirituality has always made a case for things outside the realm of matter and this book will enable many to explore this other dimension for health and healing. Hopefully complementary medicine will have a stronger footing to explore the realms that have so far been seen as pseudoscience and this applies to psychiatry as well. Psychiatry has courted with allopathic medicine and therefore has undercut its progress in the area of the subconscious. Now we have some evidence to explore this area for health and healing. High time we pushed forward in this area and spear head the frontiers that are yet to be explored for our good.<br />There are other approaches to access the subconscious then just the Psyche-K approach. I would recommend those interested to explore the field of Neurosemantics, NLP and Clinical hypnosis.
B000002JSN|5.0|Phisycal Graffiti offers some more great Led Zeppelin tunes like \\"The Rover\\", \\"In My Time of Dying\\", \\"Trampled Underfoot\\", \\"Kashmir\\", and \\"In the Light\\".  This is a two-disc album, the first with six songs and the second with nine songs.  The first disc offers six tremendous songs, but the second disc seems to lose some of its magic.  All in all, though, it is a great album to be expected of Led Zeppelin.  If I were to choose an album that best describes Led Zeppelin, this would be one of my top candidates.  I would recommend listening to Led Zeppelins 1-5 before listening to this one.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon is Pink Floyd's most popular recording, and for good reason. From start to finish, this album exhibits technical and instrumental excellence. Not since the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" or the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" has one recording been so influential for musicians and studio engineers alike. It is also their first true concept album, centered around two of Roger Waters' favorite subjects - despair and insanity. The songs seamlessly tie together, giving the illusion of one magnum opus, which it is. Memorable cuts include 'Breathe', 'Time', 'Money', and 'Us And Them', though each one is tremendous in its own right. But unlike most of Pink Floyd's albums, the guitar doesn't play a big part, though it doesn't seem to take away from the experience one bit. Not only is this required for all Floyd fans, it is essential for all fans of rock 'n' roll...period. Dark Side Of The Moon didn't remain on Billboard's charts nearly 15 years by accident. This is one of rock's most triumphant moments, and it got me, like many other people, into the band. They are now my second favorite band (The Beatles being my absolute favorite), and \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is my favorite PF album.<br /><br />So, do yourself a favor, and buy this album, or download it. Just get it. It's awesome. They DEFINITELY don't make music like this anymore, sadly.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old
B000AARKOO|4.0|KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is not just another Hollywood epic with a cast of thousands laying pillage to the earth and fellow man.  Yes, it is a mammoth production with enough spectacular sets, battle scenes, violence and atmosphere to satisfy even the most ravenous Big Picture appetite. But is also has a fine script (written by William Monahan) that elects to focus on a rather intimate series of stories that have sensitivity and tenderness and, perhaps more importantly, offers some historical background for understanding the ongoing battles over the city of Jerusalem.<br /><br />Balian (Orlando Bloom) is a recently widowed blacksmith in France in the 12th century whose long absent nobleman father Godfrey surprisingly informs him that Balian is his son and pleads with him to accompany him to Jerusalem for the Crusades, a challenge Balian slowly accepts.  Godfrey is killed in battle but manages to bestow his knighthood on Balian before he dies, leaving Balian to assume the important role of humanist in the multifaceted struggle for power that exists in Jerusalem.  King Baldwin of Jerusalem (Edward Norton) lives a holy life hiding his leprosy behind a mask and bids Balian to protect the people of the city of Jerusalem against not only the evil undermining of the Knights Templar led by Reynald (Brendan Gleeson) and the incipient King of Jerusalem Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), but also against the Saracens led by Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). Balian  is assisted by mentor Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) and by his innocent love for Sybilla (Eva Green) who unfortunately is the wife of Guy! Balian remains true to his ideals of knighthood.<br /><br />The military logistics of the various battles are a bit confusing to follow as the variation in uniforms is minimal.  But it is Balian's ever-present protection of the people of Jerusalem that leads to the historical moment that ends the siege of the city well described in history books.  The film ends in a manner that emphasizes the importance of humanity over greed, lust, war, and destruction and opens the path for compassion for the centuries long schism that still afflicts the holy city.<br /><br />The cast is excellent with small roles made large by such fine actors as Michael Sheen, David Thwelis, Velibor Topic, among others. The musical score is a magnificent blend of Western ecclesiastic themes (including Bach!) with  Eastern ones under the writing direction of Harry Gregson-Williams. John Mathieson is responsible for the vivid cinematography.  But major kudos go to Ridley Scott for making what could have been a loud blood and guts period piece into a film with a quiet heart and soul. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is an inspiring  film to see.

B00005NB8K|5.0|Formed by Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek at a night on the beach after Jim read some of his poems to Ray, The Doors became one of the greatest rock bands of all time in the late 60s. Jim Morrison was one of the first rock n roll rebels and wrote some of the darkest, deepest songs ever (\\"The End\\", \\"Strange Days\\", etc.) Even Iggy and the Stooges and the MC5 started a band themselves after being mesmerized at a Doors concert. The band started in 1965, and released their first album in 1967, and sadly the original band ended in 1971, due to Jim Morrison's unfortunate death.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's film is more about Jim Morrison than the band, to be honest. Val Kilmer's performance is so convincing, you'd think you're watching Jim in the film (and in some shots, you are!). It has been said that even the surviving Doors members had trouble distinguishing Kilmer's vocals from Morrison's own. Val Kilmer should've at least been nominated for an oscar. The actors playing the other Doors members (Kyle MacLachlan, Kevin Dillion, and Frank Whaley) have some screen time, but as I said, the movie is basically about Jim. I think this is an excellent bio-pic, but some would disagree. So, check it out if you're a fan, or even if you aren't a fan. It's a masterpiece. Oh, and Oliver Stone is an admitted fanatic Morrison fan, in interviews he has said that he views him as something of a god.
B000AA302U|1.0|This album is garbage!  A lot of people are saying that it reminds them of Traveling Without Moving which I don't understand because THAT my friends is a GREAT album but not this one.  Jamiroquai's first three albums are masterpieces in my opinion.  The horn arrangements in Emergency On Planet Earth and Traveling are tight and funky.  This album lacks the funk and arrangements that made me such a big Jamiroquai fan. <br /> <br />I keep buying his albums hoping that they will get better but they are only getting worse.  If you're a fan like me and have to have it, I say buy it used.  I was so excited to buy this album that I bought the import before it came out in the states.  What a disappointment.
B000AARKOO|4.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a fictionalized account of the events leading up to the Siege of Jerusalem in the year 1187, after which the city changed hands from Christian to Moslem rule. Godfrey, Baron of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), returns to France from the Holy Land in 1184 seeking forgiveness from his illegitimate son Balian, a blacksmith who has recently lost his wife and child. Hoping to erase his own sins and those of his wife, Balian (Orlando Bloom) joins his father to return to Jerusalem, takes the oath of a knight, and vows to protect the city's inhabitants. In Jerusalem, King Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) has made peace with the Moslem Sultan Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) but is constantly at odds with Reynald de Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson) and the Templar Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) who want war with the Moslems at any cost. Balian finds distraction from the escalating political tensions in a romance with Sibylla (Eva Green), the King's sister and wife to Guy de Lusignan.<br /><br />The major events of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" are true, and it seems that filmmakers strove for accuracy in the 2-week siege of Jerusalem in particular. But the character of Godfrey is fictional. Balian of Ibelin was a real person, but he was born a nobleman in the Middle East, not a peasant in France. Tiberias, Marshall of Jerusalem, is fictional but modeled on Raymond III of Tripoli, advisor to King Baldwin IV. The romance with Sibylla is also fictional. Sibylla stayed with her husband until her death. And Balian had a wife and children in Jerusalem. In fact, he was only in the city when it came under siege because Saladin had granted his request to enter the city to retrieve his wife. He stayed because Sibylla and the Patriarch Heraclius implored him to take command of the garrison. Saladin did, indeed, accept the surrender of Jerusalem on very generous terms, allowing most of the city's inhabitants to be ransomed at essentially discount prices.<br /><br />There were so many religious and political factions in 12th century Jerusalem that it isn't possible for a 2-hour film to explain most of them, and it is not always clear who every group or individual is in this film. \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" focuses on the clashes between Latin Christian (Crusader) factions who wished to live in peace with the Muslims and those who wanted war. To that end, the ideological and political rivalry between the knights Templar and the Hospitallers is personified in Guy de Lusignan, who wanted war for profit, and Godfrey's trusted Hospitaller friend played by David Thewlis, who advocated \\"right action\\" in all things. The constant struggle between those Crusaders and Pilgrims who had been in the Holy Land for generations and learned to live with the Muslims and the fanatic new arrivals who trickled in from Europe and wanted Muslims removed from Christian holy sites is a theme that comes up throughout the film. Honestly, I could have done with less romanticism in the portrayal of Balian's exploits and origins. It stretches credibility and diverts the film from more interesting material. But \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\"'s political and religious themes are thoughtful and instructive, and the Siege of Jerusalem is captivating in widescreen.<br /><br />The DVD (Fox Home Entertainment 2005) includes an optional historical reference guide called \\"The Pilgrim's Guide\\". If you activate this feature, historical facts related to the events in the film show up as text at the bottom of your screen. Some of this is interesting and relevant, some dull and tangential. But it appears in a big red box that covers up a significant portion of the picture, so you don't want to watch the film for the first time with \\"The Pilgrim's Guide\\" turned on. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.

B000AL730Y|5.0|This is by far one of his best albums in a long time. This cd is played all the time in my house and even at work sometimes. He also has tunes on the CD that will make you sing them meaning they will stick in your head one song that I can't get of my head is \\"Fine Line\\". I recomend that you buy this album you will not regret it
B00005LC1H|5.0|The only harsh criticism I could possibly rail against the Fawlty Towers series is that it ended much too soon. This collection is comedy at its finest; the talented ensemble cast, the quaint hotel setting, and the incredibly genius plots all work together charmingly in creating laughter in abundance, some of it quite rioutous and unavoidably laugh-out-loud. My absolute favorites are \\"Basil the Rat,\\" \\"Communication Problems,\\" and \\"The Psychiatrist.\\" However, they are all first rate. Enjoy. Cheerio.
B00005V1WO|3.0|Lord Byron (Gabriel Byrne) throws a bash like no other! Gathering his friends, including future author of Frankenstein, Mary Shelly (Natasha Richardson), Byron sets out to have a night of haunts and fear. Of course, true to the period, everyone gets blasted on laudanum (opium mixed w/ alcohol) and spends the evening in deepening states of hallucination and terror. Russell's never been my favorite director. However, he does know how to present narcosis on screen! As in ALTERED STATES, we are treated to many nightmarish images and a heavy, forboding atmosphere. While not particularly frightening or disturbing, GOTHIC has memorable sequences throughout, like the randy suit of armour, the thing in the coach, and the infamous \\"look into my eyes!\\" scene. Not bad...
B000BC8STM|5.0|IF YOU THOUGHT THAT \\"THE FAREWELL TOUR\\" WAS GORGEOUS, WHEN YOU SEE THIS REAL EXTRAVAGANZA, YOU'LL REALIZE YOU WERE WRONG.

THIS VIDEO SHOWS CHER AT HER BEST, A SEXIER THAN EVER CHER...WEARING SOME OF HER MOST EMBLEMATIC OUTFITS [\\"BANG BANG\\" - \\"FOUND SOMEONE\\" SET]. AND NOT JUST THAT...HER VOICE PERFORMANCE IS AWESOME! HER COREOGRAPHIES ROCK! <br />SOMETHING VERY ATTRACTIVE IS THE FACT OF CHER SINGS SOME COVERS FROM HER FAVORITE GROUPS, AND SHE REALLY DOES WELL. <br />AFTER WATCHING THIS DVD YOU'LL AGREE WITH ME; CHER IS THE GREATEST FEMALE ARTIST OF ALL TIMES. <br />
B000050FEN|5.0|Please stop calling it a thriller! Sure it has some of thriller's elements but it's a straightforward drama. If you read Dostoyevsky you'd notice that \\"Se7en\\" is very much alike his works. 'Cos it's about good and evil and how fighting evil sometimes can turn you into evil yourself. It's a message about violence which can't be stopped with another violence. When violence is directed against violence it ends up with... right, violence again. Vicious circle. And someone has to stop it. Detective Mills couldn't and that's why we feel so sombre after the end. Not because of Gwyneth Paltrow (you know what I mean).<br /><br />One more time we received an evidence that our world is chaotic, that it's not going to be a nice place, that it's violent and that even good intentions won't make it a better place. Forgive me my English but I assume they say: \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\\".<br /><br />\\"Se7en\\" is one of the most realistic and therefore depressive films of all time, it's a serious piece of art and by calling it a \\"thriller\\" people steel much of its value. And if you always considered it just a thriller watch it one more time, try to see what's inside and you'll be amazed at what you find.<br /><br />By the way this two-disc edition is one of the best DVD-editions ever. Audio and video transfers were remastered specially for this occasion, bonus features will take some of your precious time but you won't regret it. Definately a must-buy for anybody who likes cinema and purchases DVDs once in a while.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Finally the best Batman movie been released for the first time with bonus features. Great gift to all the Batman Fans.<br />I don't know how some people could say Batman Begins is bit better, no way it's better. The funny thing is the first time I saw Batman Begins I thought it's good as orignal 1989 Burton version. I decided to go see that movie second time and it wasnt as good as I saw it the first time but this movie (batman) from 1989 I could watch everyday. So before anyone says B.Begins is better go watch it second or third time before you make that final decision.<br /><br />Rating: from 1 to 5.<br />Batman (1989) *****<br />Batman Begins ****<br />Batman Returns **<br /><br />ONE LAST IMPORTANT THING: You might wanna keep the original first Batman DVD you bought(released 1997)cause it comes in Full Screen and Wide Screen. The new version of the movie only contains Wide Screen.
B0000399WI|3.0|Shawshank is one of those movies where you watch it, are amazed and like \\"OMG THIS IS SO GREAT\\"... and then a few hours to a day later, you suddenly realize \\"Well, I guess it wasn't THAT great.\\"  Overall, it's a good movie.  Definitely entertaining and very uplifting, even made me get teary-eyed sometimes.  But, there are some major problems with it.... <br /> <br />For one, it's so black and white.  The good guys, though rough on the edges, are still so incredibly good and likable that you are rather unable to imagine them having committed the crimes that they did in order to land in there.  The bad guys are people so stereotyped that it's ridiculous: the hypocritical, vindictive Fundamentalist Christian warden (he even had a freaking southern accent, what's up with that,) the brutal guards who only leave people alone whenever they get something out of it.  <br /> <br />I think a big problem was the decision to make Andy actually innocent.  If he had actually committed the crime, it could have been a lot better.  It would have been less \\"System crushes an innocent man\\" and more about the power of redemption.  It could have been like Dostoevsky... I guess they didn't think that people would be able to sympathize with a murderer.  So instead they rely on a crazy coincidence: it just SO HAPPENED that the night Andy was drunk and considering shooting his wife and her lover, they got murdered by someone else!  Wow!  Now THAT is timing! <br /> <br />The part that was most ridiculous to me was when they killed Tommy.  Why wouldn't they let Andy get a retrial?  Why did they actually MURDER the kid and not just, like, threaten him or send him to an insane asylum or something? <br /> <br />Another part that I found rather dumb was how Andy escaped.  I guessed from day one that he kept that rock hammer in the Bible; it's one of the most cliche stowing places of all time, so why wouldn't they check it during a cell inspection?  Wouldn't they also make sure that nothing was behind a poster? <br /> <br />And I'd like to know how a former convict breaking parole could make it to Mexico.  Also, how the heck Andy got a suit to go to the banks in. <br /> <br />Still, it's a good enough movie, it's just not a masterpiece.  It's something you should watch if you need a soulful movie.  One of the best scenes is when Andy blasts the duettino \\"Sull'aria\\" from Le Nozze di Figaro over the prison loudspeakers.  I also like how the ending made all little things throughout the movie completely pull together, almost like a Dickens novel. <br /> <br />But overall, I just can't overlook those problems.  Why is it called the Shawshank Redemption if Andy is innocent?  And no one else was redeemed; from day one they were fine, upstanding people--like I said, you had to keep reminding yourselves that they were convicted criminals.  No need for redemption.   <br /> <br />I mean, don't kid yourselves, guys.  It's a good movie, but the story is no \\"Crime and Punishment\\" or \\"Les Misrables.\\"

0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi is a very easy book to read.  It is easy to get into, and it is almost as if you do not realize you are reading.  I am not usually a reader who can sit with a book for a long time, but I was able to get through this book rather quickly, which shows how it kind of pulls you in.   <br />    The ending of the book I actually really liked.  It isn't the typical ending but that is what I like about it.  It isn't how you would invision it.  The thing that I liked about it was, well at first I thought it was kind of funny, because I thought it was just so unexpected and it was almost frusterating at the same time.  My reaction at first was that I felt like I was tricked or something which made me kind of laugh.  I was like I can't believe I read all this for this ending but anyway, it got people talking and that was probably the idea of the author.  It separated it from other books.  I enjoyed it!
B000002UAX|3.0|THIS REVIEW PERTAINS TO THE MEDIA IN WHICH THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED ON.<br /><br />With all the reissues coming out with bonus tracks, remixes, alt versions/takes and remasters, it stands to reason that the Beatles catalog should be at least remastered, maybe even remixed with today's technology in order to make the tracks more cleaner sounding.  The Yellow Submarine album was remixed (by \\"remixed\\" I mean simply mixed down again - not dance mixes, hip-hop etc) sounds better as the vocals are on both sides instead on to the left which wrecked havoc on my sense of balance when I listened to it with headphones.<br /><br />When I go into a music store and see this title it is going for close to $30, and it is not even an import!  I would have at least liked to see it remastered (remastered does not mean remixed or re-recorded and does not mean to change the music.  It has to do with sound quality).  However perhaps some b-sides or unreleased material - if any - would have been nice.  Maybe the MSFL could get ahold of the mastertapes and half-speed master them and press them to Gold cds like they have done for other classic rock and new age titles.  It would sure make sense.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|We gr.5 teachers in our town took our students to see the movie at the local theater. I am the type of person that if I am not hooked into the movie in the first 20 minutes, I know it is going to be a long sit with a nap to boot! However, my students were riveted, I was riveted into the movie from the first minute onward.<br /><br />The computer animation was very intense. The scenics, the details, the inter-relationships of all aspects of the movie were very much on target, highly synchronized, and surround-real. If there was anyone who could not follow the storyline, the rides themselves were mind bending. Rollercoastering up the and doen the mountain, skidding across the ice, looking down into the off tracks abyss of the train-central roundhouse! If that doesn't get your adrenaline going, shame on you!  Then there were the quiet moments in the film, just at the right spots, to keep you feeling safe and secure.<br /><br />I can see why this movie was more successful using computer animation rather than real actors. The action would be entirely too dangerous for both adult actors and child actors. This is the type of movie that requires the mind to take flight in a fantasy in which the child in all of us takes in fanatasy that is real and into a reality that is fantasy.<br /><br />I realize that I am a little cryptic on this topic, but I don't want to spoil the effects for those who have not yet seen this movie. It is a must see. It is also a large screen adventure in order to be the fly on the wall or the engaged spectator in the film.  Yes, this movie is so engrossing that you feel as if you are a silent part of the story, right in there with the characters. Can this movie be frightening? Yes, it can be. But then so is reality at times.<br /><br />Age group viewing?  I wouldn't encourage this movie for children younger than 6.  Children need to be old enough to have experienced remembering a few Christmases past in order to enjoy the nuiances of the children's individual delimmas on the Polar Express train. The older viewers need to have a safe person with them to hold onto during those wild rides in, on top of the train, and throughout the different sceneries.<br /><br />The music played throught was wonderful. I really liked the duet of the boy and girl over Josh Groban's contribution. But since he is the current spotlight songster soloist with a recognizable name, he got the top billing.

The older viewers need to have a safe person with them to hold onto during those wild rides in, on top of the train, and throughout the different sceneries. <br /> <br />The music played throught was wonderful. I really liked the duet of the boy and girl over Josh Groban's contribution. But since he is the current spotlight songster soloist with a recognizable name, he got the top billing.

0786890754|4.0|P.S. I love you - it's a book which made me found myself alternately smiling and tearing up throughout reading. Holly, a woman who`s love much husband, Gerry, died in brain tumor had to learn how to stay alone and went through the time of the darkness in her life. She received a package after her husband left a month. Thus, her hardness time was helped along by a monthly letter which left behind by her husband. Every letter was written in the last time of Gerry, every letter was coded `P.S. I love you' at the end, every letter you can find the word of love and care. It didn't carry lots of words, just only one or two sentence, but you will tear with Holly when you read it. The author use very clean and easy word to tell a good story, following the life of Holly, who is forced to deal with the loss of her husband. It is a book, I have read where I have had to stop reading to dry my eyes and take a deep breath before continuing.  <br /> <br />I can't imagine losing my husband and attempting to pick up piece he left behind. I am not sure did Gerry as he said just stay in somewhere around Holly, but I wish. I can imagine that when the time he wrote thus little letter, it is hard for him to leave away Holly that let her to stay alone in the left time. He wanted her to be brave, to be independent, and to be fall in love again. It is lucky for Holly has such a husband and it is also unlucky for her that he passed away to early.  <br />
0553573403|5.0|I first heard of this series when I was reading Tad William's \\"Otherland\\" series.  Which, I'll say if you're a fan of any sci-fi/fantasy, you should check it out.<br /><br />My experience in fantasy is not that deep.  My first fantasy series is the \\"Otherland\\" series.  And while it was a very well written book, sometimes it drug on.  It was also very formulaic.  However, that's nothing new.  Nearly every book is the same...<br /><br />Good versus bad guy.  Bad guy is notably \\"evil\\"(the author will make sure you know this).  Good guy faces many pitfalls.  However, said good guy prevails in the end.  Then of course, the famed \\"happy ending\\".<br /><br />You see this everywhere, in books, on TV, in movies...<br /><br />George R. R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" does away with the usual, boring formula.  This world is a world so much like our own.  Yet, the biggest difference is that there are no set seasons.  Summer and winter can last decades, with winter being incredibly harsh.  Let me just say that this concept is so simple, yet adds something to the setting that is just so...fresh.<br /><br />The characters are so rich.  While, GRRM does a wonderful job at describing his surroundings, I don't think that is the best aspect.  The story rests wholly on his characters, or so I believe.  Even the chapters are set up differently.  Each chapter is named after a character and it's from their perspective.  All the characters have their flaws.  And their flaws are made known.  These characters don't seem fake or made up to make the story better.  The story is full of the best and worst in us all.  There is no true \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" in this book.  Don't misunderstand this, though.  There is a notable good and bad side, one side wants to do good, while another wants to do bad.  However, the \\"good\\" characters will cheat, lie, steal, maim, or even kill, just to do what is right...<br /><br />Oh, and be warned GRRM is not afraid to kill off main characters.  If someone is in danger and there's a chance he/she will die, don't expect someone to rescue them.  They WILL die.<br /><br />This is also a world comprised of humans.  There are talk of mythical beasts and supernatural beings, but it's a human world.  Which is a good change.  Magic is present, but there is very little.  So, it makes it more special when you do see it.<br /><br />This book was wonderful and if it's any indication to the rest of the series... I can't wait to read the rest of it.in danger and there's a chance he/she will die, don't expect someone to rescue them.  They WILL die. <br /> <br />This is also a world comprised of humans.

B000AL730Y|3.0|As others have mentioned, Fine Line bears some resemblance to Flaming Pie, Jenny Wren is Blackbird redux, and I'd say Friends to Go has some striking similarities to Another Day. This Never Happened Before? Yes, it did. At The Mercy (my apologies to the many reviewers who seemed to like it) sounds like it was written in five minutes, at gunpoint. English Tea proves that Pie isn't the only thing Flaming in Macca's repetoire. And I cannot believe that someone who recorded You Know My Name (Look Up The Number) to spoof lounge singers would come up with a Perry Coma vehicle like A Certain Softness (reminiscent of Till There Was You). Quality of lyrics are also inconsistent. But having said all of that, this is still a listenable and worthy body of work. The production and musicianship are reminiscent of Beatles albums, tight and crisp. Paul sounds every bit of 63, but he can still sing remarkably well. As always, he makes the best of whatever material he has. Not his best, not his worst, and more authentically Beatlesque than anything else you'll find out there.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|All the tracks are good and some are great.  <br /> The biggest one has the killa and eek-a-mouse on it! <br />
0395389496|5.0|A few years ago I had the privilege to read this book at a Middle School Christmas Party in Webster City. I could not believe a group of adults would be awe struck  by me reading a children's book. But there I was reading and after it was over with a great round of applause!! Everyone enjoyed riding the Polar Express on that December afternoon. This is a book that will be enjoyed by everyone whether children or adults! The pictures are a delight to enjoy too! Happy Holidays!!
B000AA305M|5.0|I'm in awe....excuse me...I have to wipe the tears from my eyes.  This is incredible music and David Gray is an incredible singer.  This IS what once WAS the undescribed power of Van Morrison, Cat Stevens, Tim Buckley and so on.  Gray is probally the only male singer current that taps into the same realm they did.  I'm moved by the songs in the same way I'm moved by \\"Moonshadow\\" or \\"Brand New Day.\\"  I sing also and I've found new inspiration for myself.  Gray is just incredible.  I saw him perform \\"The One I Love\\" on Late Night With Conan O'Brian and knew I had to pick up a copy of the album.  My best friend has owned \\"White Ladder\\" for sometime and I loved it when he played it for me a year or so ago.  I planed on buying it but didn't get around to it, I will now though.  This is easily one of the best albums of 2005.  David Gray makes me believe that living life in slow motion may actually be possible.
B000B5IPLK|1.0|Would Alicia Keys have a major record label is she was not pretty. There are tons of better singers, songwriters, piano players then her but they are not actrative like alicia. One more thing why did she do a duet with that sissy for marron 5 could'nt she got someone less lame and mainstream. The other guest artists on here have cds to promote so that is why they are here. If mtv is going to bring back unplugged then get bands and singers that sound good acoustic. Mtv really sucks they should just change there name to Reality tv that way people would not complain about then not playing videos that much. Mtv used to be great when i was younger i watch it all the time it was i think TRL that ruin it. Don't be suprised if next they come out with a ashlee simpson unplug cd now that is a thought that would make you cringe.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is for people who like punk and rock music with lots of guitar.  <br /> <br />I was never really into Green Day until I heard 'American Idiot', the first song released off the album. Then I knew, I had to be one of their fans, so I got some more of their stuff. <br /> <br />'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' is one the the great slower songs from the album. In the video it shows what happens after the 'Holiday' video. <br /> <br />'Jesus of Surburbia' and 'Homecoming' are the longest songs, both lasting over nine minutes long and are fantastic! I personally love every part of 'Jesus of Surburbia'. <br /> <br />I think the best song is probably 'St. Jimmy'. It starts well, slows down a bit, then speeds up. It's really upbeat and you just wanna jump around, headbang or something!
B0009YA3YU|5.0|I have a small collection of movies in UMD format, and I try to collect any anime releases that come out in that format. Some of the releases are disappointing. For example, Ghost in the Shell and Ninja Scroll (both Manga releases) have no extra features - no choice of audio track, no subtitles, rudimentary menus, and and overall \\"soft\\" image quality. Ninja Scroll is also presented in the controversial \\"wide screen\\" version even though the original film was in a 4:3 aspect ratio. All in all, Manga has given short shrift to the UMD format, bringing out barely adequate releases. <br /> <br />Geneon, on the other hand, has produced superior products in their UMD releases. Akira and Appleseed (both Geneon releases) act and feel like their big brother DVDs. Interesting menus, audio tracks in both the original Japanese and English, and English subtitles. Picture quality is razor sharp, the way it should be for the PSP's superior screen. <br /> <br />The Akira UMD has very good stereo imaging, and a crisp image. If you are a fan of this landmark anime you will be pleased by the excellent presentation that Geneon has given it in the UMD format.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I love this movie. The actors/actresses chosen for the roles in the movie are perfect, seeing Richard O'Brien in a recent film, I was half expecting him to start the Time Warp! The new adaptation of the fairy tale Cinderella is not as shocking as the Romeo and Juliet film with DiCaprio but this film with Barrymore was softer, kinder and much more romantic. Angelica Huston portrayed the wicked stepmother perfectly and the one sister, Margaret, was the best portrayal of a ratty stepsister, competely mean! I would recommend purchase of this film if you like romance/comedy movies. If you liked \\"Never been Kissed\\" then you will love this film. I would place it in the same category as \\"The Princess Bride, Never Been Kissed and The truth about Cats and Dogs\\" the whole rags-to-riches-finding-prince-charming thing!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|For this old \\"coop\\", as my 6 year old daughter calls me, this DVD set brings back a flood of memories.  I saw them 6-16-68 at Camden County Music Fair and again 11-1-68 at the Spectrum.  Still have the photos from the first row!  I think the added years and simple survival put a tear in my eyes and chills down my spine.  They still have it, that special something that lights my fire.  I haven't really followed Clapton since Cream went south, but the guy can still flat out play.  And it's just great that JB survived his illness, and Ginger, well he's still Ginger after all these years, flubs included.  And unlike other \\"survivors\\" (hello Mick and Keith) they don't make fools of themselves trying to act as though all those years hadn't passed by.  It's not a nostalgia concert, it's three premiere musicians at the top of their game. The songs are all well played, the improvs are exciting, the camerawork is A+.  It would be a delight if all four nights were released in a box set, but I'm so glad to have this.  Now if McLaughlin and the rest of the guys would get together...oh well we do have the Mahavishnu Project.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|This CD is good but it's missing a few songs that should be on here like Mr. Brownstone, Nightrain, etc.  Overall, its a good greatest hits <br /> <br />Welcome to the Jungle: This is a no brainer, instant classic <br /> <br />Sweet Child of Mine: Great intro, great solo, one of the greatest songs ever <br /> <br />Patience: Slow but overall a good song <br /> <br />Paradise City: This song is a masterpiece from start to finish. One of the best if not the best Guns N Roses songs ever. <br /> <br />Knocking on Heavens Door: Good but gets old. Don't listen to it 60 times a day like my brother did or it will get old. <br /> <br />Civil War: Great lyrics and overall good song <br /> <br />You could be mine: This song is catchy and pretty good <br /> <br />Don't Cry: Very good song although it's at a slow tempo <br /> <br />November Rain: The best 9 minute song ever created and the last minute and a half is incredible <br /> <br />Live and Let die:  This song is a cover but i like it more than the original one. Crazy fast paced tempos are what make this song cool <br /> <br />Yesterdays: This song is okay. Not the best but not the worst <br /> <br />Ain't it fun: I dont like this song <br /> <br />Since I dont have you: I dont really like this song either <br /> <br />Sympathy for the Devil: This song is a cover of the Rolling Stone's Sympathy for the Devil. Not as good as the Stone's version but this version aint that bad <br /> <br />Overall, if you're just getting into Guns N Roses, you should get the greatest hits or just get Appetite for Destruction.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I have been an avid Dylan fan from the begining. I doubt any other director than Martin Scorsese could have captured such an elusive target as well as he did. I do rank \\"The Last Waltz\\" a sligh notch higher.<br /><br />My few complaints with the film are this: First of all, in spite of a lot of footage of them, The Band is barely mentioned. After not touring for 8 years it was The Band he toured with. Several of their members were about the only people he ever co-wrote songs with. Two of the most famous bootlegs were \\"The Basement Tapes\\" and the \\"Royal Albert Hall Concert\\", both with The Band. Some of the finest music ever.<br /><br />Secondly, I wish there was more of his carrer than after 1966. The tidbit with one of his heroes, Johnny Cash is just mentioned.<br /><br />Inspite of this, it is a great look at a great man. By today's hyper-commercial music as product era, I can't imagine news that people were booing at a Britiany Spears concert for selling out!<br /><br />In the second disk you see him begin to unravel. The innane questions at press conferences show real humor. I loved the one where he was asked how many protest singers there were. \\"About 136\\", he said! He really paid an emotional price for playing the music he wanted and this clearly comes out in the film. Thanks to D.A. Pennebaker's work. This is summed up in the end of his European tour when I says in an almost plaintive voice, \\"I want to go home.\\"<br /><br />Last thing, I hope that D.A. Pennebaker releases \\"Eat the Document\\" after seeing so much of it in this film it whets my appetite for the whole thing.
B00005JO0J|5.0|My wife hates sci-fi.  It is hard to get her to watch anything with me that involves sci-fi.  But after seeing Serenity, she wants to buy the DVD.  It is a wonderful movie that is about characters which drive the plot and not fancy computer created graphics.  The antagonist in this movie is, by far, more menacing than any dark jedi.  I recommend that everyone see the movie in the theater and not wait for the DVD since it plays so well on the big screen.
B000002HD5|5.0|This is about as emotionally intense as it gets. Apart from Dylan's classic album \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" I can think of no other record that so perfectly encompasses the bitterness and beauty of heartbreak.<br /><br />There's a venom that lines the music and lyrics, and everything is is almost masochistically brutal and occasionally just nasty. It's dirty and raw, and filled with an honesty that music rarely has the guts to even try to emote.<br /><br />This is not some angst-ridden whining that typifies what music today offers up for expression. This is a portrait of the brutality that simultaneously tortures and enriches relationships. Loaded with malice, bitterness, insight, guilt, pennance, and love, Gentlemen is a seminal work that feels as though it's always been there. It's a soundtrack to your pain, and it aggressively forces you to confront yourself. As another reviewer put it, this album is something of a confessional, and it is hard to not identify with it, as harrowing as it can be to do so.<br /><br />When Sub Pop was making it's big push, the two bands they were placing their bets on were The Afghan Whigs and Nirvana. I guess it's obvious that Nirvana \\"won\\" that contest, and while there are commonalities between the bands (and I would say that the Whigs deserve a bit more public acclaim than they have recieved), Nirvana never created anything as naked as this album. There's nothing obtuse about this; it's as straight forward and 'in your face' as rock music can be.<br /><br />If you're already a fan, I would also recommend hunting down the \\"What Jail is Like EP,\\" which features some of the best cover songs ever... namely the cover of The Assponies \\"Mr. Superlove;\\"  which belongs up there alongside the soaring accomplishments of Gentlemen.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie was great. My ONLY pet peeve (you gotta have one..)was the child's acting during the murder scene. It just wasn't very good. He didn't even cry or scream. Yes, i realize thats petty but it really did bug me. If your parents were killed in front of you..  chances are you'd do more than sit there looking sour. Thats all i'm sayin'. But don't get me wrong, am i gonna buy the DVD?! hell yeah!! Great movie and i look forward to the next one with the Joker! Wonder if Jack Nicholson's too old to return...  he was awesome. <br /> <br />The bonus DVD is really kind of a hassle. Its cool looking but not very user friendly. Sort of annoying, actually. To get to a particular feature and bypass others... its a headache. And forget it if you pick the wrong one..  The idea is great but its not worth the effort.  <br /> <br />I agree to some extent with a review who said when he talks as Batman its a bit much. The gnashing teeth and growl is a bit much but only enough to notice. I wouldn't say it ruined anything for me. However i hope for more action next time around now that the character has been set up.
B000301YY8|5.0|I love this CD... If you have a pulse you'll have a place in your heart for this man's beautiful and emotional voice.  Just get it you won't regret it.  Think David Gray, meets<br /><br />Jason Mraz(youthfullness) with Chris Martin's(coldplay) Lyrics.. You'll absolutely never be disappointed by this album!
B000002B1M|5.0|This 1996 Hip Hop sophomore album is easily one of the best releases in the genre coming from Nas, although maybe not as strong as his debut. \\"It Was Written\\" features rhythmic, musical beats rather than much of the hardcore sampling you would hear from many other hip hop artists. Also, Nas uses his sensational flow, great lyrics and artistic talents to make this a great listen.<br /><br />\\"The Message\\" is the perfect opener to follow the Introduction, with Nas flowing quickly and accurately. This is easily one of the more catchy songs, and ultimately a big highlight. \\"Street Dreams\\" is a classic parody, with some sweet rhymes. The set of songs that fall in around the middle of the album all feature some fantastic beat hooks, solid lyrics and great rapping from Nas, however are generally a little less memorable. \\"Nas Is Coming\\" features an appearance by Dr. Dre, one of the most influential and famous rapper/producer in the hip hop industry.  \\"Affirmative Action\\" is my favourite on the album, featuring a great guest appearance from a female rapper.<br /><br />With myself a part of a rap group called \\"The Authentics\\", hearing Nas certainly gives me different perspectives on how to approach composing a song, however our group does not have a sound that in any way mimicks his style or beats. The latter half to \\"It Was Written\\" maintains the solidity present throughout the first half, with classic beats and rhythmic qualities. The last track was a pretty big hit, and ends the album very well.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this album to any Nas fan, a hip hop fan, or anyone exploring the genre, because it is certainly a great place to start. Highly recommended.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is the best Cast Recording I have ever heard for any play. A friend sent me one song, \\"for good\\" and I was hooked. I automatically had to get ALL the songs. And now I listen to the CD everyday anytime I can. This has made me want to see it on stage now, so come May, I am going! I would recommed this soundtrack to anyone and everyone.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Speaking with others who have seen this movie, it seems that there are two camps; the \\"I love this movie!!\\" camp or the \\"This is the worst movie I've ever seen\\" camp. If you are looking for a fast paced movie with quick and witty dialogue, this IS NOT for you.  <br />The film started slowly and there are some scenes that are just plain weird. But as the credits rolled my husband and I looked at each other and said the same thing, \\"that was really fun!\\"
B00005JO0J|5.0|When Gene Roddenberry first pitched his concept for Star Trek to networks execs he presented it as \\"a 'Wagon Train' to the stars\\".  It is unclear whether Star Trek ever achieved that vision.  However, there is no doubt that Joss Wheedon did succeed when he created the television series \\"Firefly\\" and the current major motion picture \\"Serenity\\".    The story so far.    Five hundred years from now the earth is used up and humanity takes to the stars.  They discover hundreds of planets and moons that they terraform to become new earths.  Some of these planets are \\"rich and flush with the new technology; some not so much\\".  The Alliance tries to bring all planets under centralized control.    There was some disagreement on that point.  A civil war ensued between the Alliance and the Independents. After the war many of the defeated Independents drifted to the outer reaches of the known universe (or simply the 'verse in Firefly-speak)  and they are made to get by with only the most basic of technology.    Enter the crew of the cargo ship Serenity, an amiable and good hearted group of outlaws just trying to get by in a screwed up universe, I mean 'verse.    The movie opens where the TV shows leaves off.  Simon Tam (Sean Maher) has rescued his sister River (Summer Glau) from the clutches of the Alliance.  You see River is a prodigy and the Alliance has conducted experiments on her in an effort to enhance her abilities which has the side effect of leaving her psychotic.    They take refuge on board Serenity but are pursued by an evil agent of the Alliance known only as \\"The Operative\\", played with icy panache by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  Ejifor's performance is one the best in the film and his is most memorable villain.    We are then whisked off on a wild ride to discover the secrets of not only River's psychosis but also the awful truth behind the origins of the cannibalistic sub-humans known as \\"The Reavers\\".    I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Though the special effects are good they are in no way in the class of Star Wars.  However, where Star Wars tends to fall flat in the areas of acting, story and dialogue \\"Serenity\\" wildly succeeds.  The story is well told and plotted and Wheedon suffuses the whole with moments of whit and humor.  Some of the best comic moments are reserved for engineer Kaylee Frye, played by the incredibly gorgeous Jewell Staite, and tough guy Jayne Cobb, played by the always reliable Adam Baldwin.     The entire cast, which is lead by Nathan Fillion as Captain Malcolm Reynolds (think Robin Hood meets Han Solo), reprise their roles without missing a beat. Unlike some of the failed Star Trek movies, Wheedon does an excellent job of utilizing his entire cast in a way that never seems contrived. Each character is given their own unique moment in the film.  Other returning members of the cast include Gina Torres as first mate Zoe Washburn, Alan Turdyk as the pilot simply known as \\"Wash\\", Ron Glass as the intriguing clergyman Shepherd Book and the exotically beautiful Morena Baccarin as Ambassador Inara Serra.    Another reason \\"Serenity\\" is so successful is the Wheedon resists the temptation to condescend to his audience and does not fall back on tired plot devices.  This leads to some surprising moments, including the deaths of two major characters.  Wheedon also does not succumb to the temptation to provide a romantic moment between Fillion and Baccarin.    Fans of the television show should and I think will adore this movie.  It picks up and embellishes on the original episodes and provides a satisfying conclusion should this be the end of the line.  I certainly hope it is not and I have read that the entire cast has signed on for a sequel should \\"Serenity\\" prove sufficiently successful at the box office.    If you have never watched the show before the movie provides enough backstory for you to jump right in and enjoy.  Some of the character bits will not be as meaningful but there is more than enough here for you to enjoy.   So please do all of us \\"Firefly\\" fans a favor see \\"Serenity\\" so that there might be a future for this great story and these great characters.
B000002JSN|5.0|Yes, Lep Zeppelin IV is the deservedly \\"classic\\" release, the one that oh so many lesser bands have struggled mightly to imitate. Physical Graffiti, however, is so grandiose in it's ambitions and so epic in it's scope that you gotta love it. And at two discs worth, that's a whole lotta love. All facets of the group are on display here, from sturdy, no frills crunch (\\"The Rover\\")to almost cinematic imagery (\\"Kashmir\\"). A double disc set that does it all, and a must have for the dedicated Zep fan.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|When this made-for-TV movie came out, I remember being scared out of my pants for days literally...  The fact that this was at the height of the Cold War era, and many people believed that Ronald Reagan was... well crazy enough and so were the Soviets made this broadcast so real.  Oddly enough though, the British managed to outdo it with THREADS, which made me about twice as physically ill when it aired on TV.<br /><br />The Broadcast was scary, and I remember after a panel of experts appearing on a special Nightline and a special call in to discuss issues.  - - Could it happen ?  Could anyone survive ?  Would the living envy the dead ?  - - and even more horrifyingly the fact that one of the more controversial elements of the broadcast was the arguement that the broadcast presented an OPTOMISTIC view of what it would be like to survive a nuclear holocaust.<br /><br />Though just a made for TV movie (in an era when made-for-TV movies were usually corny), I have found this broadcast to be the most disturbing movie I've ever scene because at the time it was such a real possibility.  (Even now it is... but then you could really sense that the U.S. was at a \\"let's see who blinks first\\" stand off with the Soviet Union.)<br /><br />In conclusion, THE DAY AFTER actually wasn't the first broadcast of its type... about 40 years earlier there was actually a radio drama centered around the aftermath of a Nuclear War called THE FIFTH HORSEMAN...  check it out ! ! !
B0009PVZWI|5.0|In Your Honor is by far one of the best albums of 2005.  It took a few listens for me to get fully into but I've been listening to it everyday for about the past 3 months.  Disc 1 you listen to when you want ROCK!  Disc 2 when you feel more mellow and you're chillin'.  This album showcases the true versatility of this amazing band.  Whether you're into acoustic, rock, or both you will not be disappointed.  Highlight tracks are \\"Best of You\\", \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"Friend of a Friend\\" (which Grohl wrote about Kurt Cobain), and \\"Razor\\". A truly remarkable album from beginning to end.  The Foo Fighters deliver on every level.  Well done!
B000007489|5.0|This has to be the best punk, most hardcore album ever made.  From the psychotic cackling at the opening, to the nonstop assault of sound, to the most real lyrics about angst, aggression, and how f!@# up the world is, this album stands above all other punk/hardcore, especially the pop crap that's been mainlined into the teeny-bop mainstream.  G.G. Allin's lyrics may be more evil and demented, the Dead Kennedys may be more political, but nobody else touches the musical rage of this CD.  The later Suicidal albums are definitely disappointing in comparison, and sound like an attempt to go in a much slower and more studio direction.<br /><br />If you want to hear real punk, get this CD.
B00005JNEI|4.0|First I should say I'm neither a liberal nor a conversative and can't call myself any particular political stripe, since, depending on the issue, I range from liberal to conservative, and more likely indifferent these days. I think America has fallen from the great country it once was politically and socially, mainly due to 40 years of mediocre presidents and inept and venal politicians who care very little for the welfare of the American people and only about lining their own pockets. I don't see much reason to care at all anymore or to vote, which is too bad, since at one time I was quite patriotic and really loved this country. Sure, we have freedom and free speech, which is great, but sadly that hasn't prevented the country from still going to the dogs over the last several decades.<br /><br />I heard so much about this film, so I had to finally rent it. It's a decent film but I didn't find it as engrossing or interesting as it had been made out to be, but I will give him four stars for effort since, if all the allegations about the Bush family's ties to the Saudis and Bin Laden family are true, this needs to be said. But there's no doubt about Moore's central premise, that the U.S. is mostly in Iraq for oil and money. As Major General Smedley Butler said two generations ago, when the dollar gets tired of making 6% at home, it starts looking for ways to make 100% abroad, and the flag follows the money, and the soldiers follow the flag.<br /><br />Whether one is liberal or conservative or independent or whatever, it's time for the American people to take back their control of the political process from the special interests and politicians who have no other interest but their own.<br /><br />Actually, at this point, I would be happy to embrace with open arms a president of almost ANY political stripe as long as he had some geopolitical and economic smarts and at least had a coherent plan. I'm tired of the clueless office spaceholders we've had for almost 40 years. We used to have giants for presidents in the past, at least once in a while--Lincoln, a Teddy Rooseveldt, FDR, even Truman was pretty cool. Now we get pygmies 100% of the time. Only it's more like totally clueless and inept pygmies. At least a good pygmy knows how to shoot a blowgun.<br /><br />By the way, on the oil and money issue, most people don't know that many years ago, when Saddam was bombing the Kurds, Rumsfeld met with Saddam, long before he was Secretary, not to complain about his killing Kurds, but to negotiate an oil deal. The meeting was secret at the time but it eventually got out that he'd met with Saddam during this time. Guess what, Rumsfeld didn't say anything about the Kurds issue but we were concerned about getting a juicy oil contract.<br /><br />Oh well, that's all I have to say on this depressing issue of present America's moral, social, and economic decline (the current war expenses and deficit and high gas prices will likely cause inflation and serious economic consequences eventually. There's a reason why economics is called \\"The dismal science\\"). I hope America eventually finds its moral compass and goes back to being the sort of great country it once was, but I doubt that will ever happen. Great countries don't just happen, they are built by great people working with great leaders. Those seem awfully hard to find in this country anymore.years.

B0009S4IHY|1.0|Empty storyline, stupid jokes, predictable ending.. Only the fights are somewhat good.. See Kill Bill it's way better
B000B8I8X2|3.0|I only gave this album 3 stars because it didn't really blow me out of the water or anything. there are SOME kick-ass songs on the album but there are also SOME that I personally just cant get into due to the cheesy singing. It is amazing what they did with bringing this many artists together and I respect them for that but as far as an album that I can put in my car stereo and crank up, there are a lot of songs on here lacking.
B00004Z459|1.0|iF YOU REGRET BUYING THIS ALBUM AND THROWING YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY AWAY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT PRESS YES. IF YOU FIND THIS ALBUM A GREAT INVESTMENT AND SOMEDAY THIS WILL BE A CLASSICAL ALBUM THAT WILL GO TO BE AN ALLTIME GREAT PRESS NO.
B000006UNG|5.0|COLOUR OF SPRING is an album that pushes all the limits of pop music to extreme beauty ; the sound has a complex structure so well composed that you might wonder if this music was done by an ordinary bunch of artists ; COLOUR OF SPRING has depth , atmosphere in it ; you get the feeling that the sound is coming from the ground and echoeing in the air : IT IS THE PERFECT ALBUM TO GET YOU OUTSIDE YOUR ROOM AND YOUR BODY !!! <br />By buying this album you will be offering yourself 45 minutes of pure ecstasy !!! <br />
B00005JNX0|3.0|Madagascar is a mediocre movie. Not the best when it comes to family entertainment. <br /> <br />The CGI is great (especially with the details in it) The casting is ok. A lot of good names. The problem is the plot. It's boring and has no bunch. The jokes are lame (maybe because I'm not 10) While other movies have jokes for parents and kids, this movie doesnt seem to have them. Madagascar needs to be a funnier movie.
B00006IU73|5.0|Easily one of the most lush, ambient, and overall haunting musical achievements of our time.  Something to just kick back and enjoy life to on a cold rainy day, if you're like me at least.  A personal favorite of mine and must have for everyone! <br /> <br />Its not too hard to see why either.  Steve Wilson's ultra crisp production perfectly accents and enhances these 12 gorgeous songs, all of which are packed with enough atmosphere and depth to keep you coming back again and again.  This is where it all came together, where it finally clicked for these guys.  Strictly in a commercial sense, that is, as this is their most accesible album to date.  But accessible strictly in that Porcupine Tree sort of way, as you may already be fortunate enough to know. <br /> <br />Steve Wilson just may be the Mozart of our time. The man quite simply has a natural gift as far as music is concerned, and his ear for sonic clarity sets the modern day standard.    <br /> <br />Overall a must have for music fans of all ages.  Personal favorites include Blackest Eyes, Trains, and Prodigal. <br /> <br />Go BUY IT!
B00003BDXG|3.0|I never saw this when it origanally came out. But 11 years later the criticism of the media is still true (or even more true) The artistic views of Stone is well done (colorful and original) The violence is not so bad by today's standards. The shock value is gone and the film becomes a little tedious.
015603008X|5.0|There are few science fiction stories as touching as Flowers for Algernon. We care about Charlie because he's the focus of the story, not the experiment that makes him a genius. The ending moves us because we witness what's happening to him in human terms, not scientific ones. All good fiction is about the characters, something Daniel Keyes clearly understood. For that reason, Flowers for Algernon is- and will remain- a classic. A newer novel with a fairly similar theme- and very memorable characters- is An Audience for Einstein. Both books have a strong emotional impact that lingers. <br />
B000002LEE|4.0|Never in the history of rock and roll was a band so original as Janes Addiction. One of the biggest and best and most influential bands of all time. Nothings Shocking was Janes Addiction's first album, well techically there second, but its there first studio album, is it as good as there other albums, no not really, but it does have somehting the other three albums dont have, the enjoyment of making the music. When Janes got the record deal to record this album they said they would only do it if the could have complete and total creative control which they had on all their albums but this is the only one where that is aparent.<br /><br />On Ritual the band was trying (as much as they dont wanna admit it) to make a big album. The two albums are nothing alike. This sounds like a band having fun making music for the sake of making music. Ritual sounds like a band trying to make it. Strays sounds like a big areana rock album. Those two albums are far better then this but the point is this one is more true.<br /><br />The album opens with a Janes classic 'Up The Beach' which why its a classic I dont understand. Apart from a few guitar solos and cool riffs this is just a boring ten minute song. 'Ocean Size' is one of the better songs the band ever made, great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship. 'Had A Dad' 'Ted Just Admit It' and 'Standing In The Shower' are all good songs but they could have been a whole lot better. They just sound like average rock songs to me, and comming from a band that is capable of so much more that is jsut not excpeptable. 'Summertime Rolls' is one of the best and most beautiful love songs ever written and recorded. This song is just amazing and needs to be heard to appreciate. 'Mountain Song' is one of the best songs ever. Easily one of Janes Addictions best songs ever. The opening line sets the pace for and amazing rocker. What makes this song ever better is that the way they relate comming down a mountain to comming off Herion. But the opening bass line was ripped of by Judas Priest on Revolution off of the album Angel Of Retrabution. 'Idiots Rule' is a very good song, I really just did not enjoy it. I dont need to say anything about 'Jane Says' because as anyone who has heard the sone kows it is one of the best pieces of music ever made. Simpley amazing! 'Thank You Boys' is pointless. 'Pigs N Zen' is suppost to be an amazing song but it just isnt. Its not a very good way to end an album.<br /><br />I can say that this is an album that is hard to get into but once you do get into it its really pretty good. Also I was dissapointed when i bought this because I thought it was going to be better. The guitar Playing by Navvaro is amazing, Stephen and Eric play a great rythym section, and Perry's vocals are great and so are his lyrics, but I dont think I this album they knew how to mesh those four talents together properly yet. So I would recomend this album to anyone who is interested in something weird and different.g bass line was ripped of by Judas Priest on Revolution off of the album Angel Of Retrabution.

B000286RNY|5.0|Turned off by the title? Martial arts plus soccer... can it get any duller?! That was basically my reaction when this movie came out. I couldn't even take enough interest in it to even dismiss it from my mind. It just went in one ear and out the other, and I never thought of it again. <br />Everyone out there who's actually WATCHED this movie is now thinking what a fool I was. And let me tell you, so am I. <br />Anybody out there who enjoys martial arts... seriously... get this movie. Get this movie and Kung Fu Hustle. You've never seen anything like this stuff. Wild doesn't begin to describe it. <br />And Stephen Chow: make as many movies as you can. Can't wait for the next one.
B00065VTU4|5.0|While I dont agree that 461 Ocean Boulavard is Eric Claptons best album of his carear or the 1970's for that matter I will say that it is one of his better albums. When this was originaly released in 1976 it became Eric Claptons biggest selling album at the time. While this is more pop then blues-rock it was still a great album. Filled with blistering guitars by the legend himself and great song after great song it was no wonder why this sold so much.<br /><br />This album was filled with classic Eric Clapton songs. 'Willie And The Hand Jive' 'I Shot The Sheriff' 'Let It Grow' and 'Steady Rollin Man' are all classic Eric Clapton songs and the first three still get regular air play on the classic rock radio stations. While the rest of the album didnt pruduce any other hit singles or \\"classics\\" the songs are still good especially 'Give Me Strength' which in my honest openion is one of Eric Claptons all time best songs. My favorite thing about this album is that it is very laid back and mellow, but at the same time I always wished this album had a little more kick behind its songs, but oh well what are ya gonna do.<br /><br />The live disc is amazing, as are all live Eric Clapton disks. Clapton's playing on this disk is amazing as always, 'Layla' the Cream classic 'Badge'and the classic 'Let It Rain' what more could you ask from the man. Then you get the all time blues classic 'The Sky Is Cryin' and while I think Clapton could have done it better he still did a pretty good job here. The best thing on this disk though is his cover of 'Little Wing' its just absolutly amazing.<br /><br />The bonus songs on the first disk are great as well but they could have been better and seeing as those versions have laready been availabe they are kind of pointless, but they do add something extra to the mix.<br /><br />So overall I would say this is an excelent reissue of a classic Eric Clapton album, and I wish they would do this with more of his albums, especially his albums from the 1980's becuase while they were not that good with a little help they could be ever better.from the 1980's becuase while they were not that good with a little help they could be ever better.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This is a great martial arts movie. Great, terrific, amazing, pick your compliment. Others have already written thorough reviews. I'm just here to register my opinion. Nobody else is making movies like this, but nobody. Wild martial arts, genuinely funny comedy (which is really pretty rare in this genre), and at least one scene that if pure cinematic brilliance... really, one of the most extraordinary moments I've ever seen on film. If you've seen this movie, you probably know what I'm talking about. If you haven't all I can say is: when you hear haunting music, don't... look... away. Great stuff. <br />Stephen Chow: keep 'em coming.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|When I first heard of this all-star album I was really excited to see what would come of it..........and let me say if you love metal this album is for you. 18 songs with 18 singers.  From extreme metal to pop metal and in between. Great variety as you can hear the different styles of guitar,bass and drums blend together on this monster of a compliation. Wait there is more.......a bonus dvd....yes.... a behind the scenes look at how this all came together. With interviews from the team captains down to the players and engineers. WOW....I am totally floored. Now I bought mine from Best Buy and it came with this dvd. Hopefully all will receive it when they buy the cd.  Amazing stuff in each track. You will be happy you picked this gem up..........so metalheads..........WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!
0307276902|5.0|I hadn't heard anything about this book previous to reading it.  It sounded very interesting, but as I opened the book, I didn't know what I was getting myself into.  Frey writes in such a way that you can almost feel his pain.  He's truely written an amazing book, and I plan on purchasing anything else he has out.  Frey is a very talented writer and not afraid to share his story with anybody.  I would reccomend this book to anybody.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|From the moment that I heard the music of Alica Keys my first thought was an 'unplugged' performance with REAL instrumentalists emphasizing her abilities as a singer,composer and pianist.On 'Unplugged' Keys tickles the ivorys and works the fender rhodes with her own special flare especially on some super funky music such as \\"Heartburn\\" and her new<br /><br />number \\"Unbreakable\\"-it's as if hip-hop had never invaded R&B and covered it over like a blanket.She certainly brings her youthful vigor to classic soul covers of \\"If I Were Your Woman\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\" but her most exciting moments are when she faithfully essays ghetto-soul/rap poetry on \\"Streets Of New York City\\".Hip hop (and reggae) show up on the closing \\"Love It Or Leave It Alone\\".As far as I am concerned 'Alicia Keys Unplugged' is my favorite contemporary R&B album of the year.It nods to genuine funk,soul and jazzy pop with the featured artist in her natural setting and I recommend this not only to fans but anybody with a closed eye on modern R&B who think it's still all hip-hop based and shallow because this is not.So take hold of your good karma and enjoy.
B0002OOUP0|2.0|First of all, this set should have started at '72.  \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Wild Horses\\" are repeats from several other compilations and singles collections; and take up space of songs they left off from this era (such as \\"She's So Cold\\" and \\"Shattered\\").  Second, the disc has a really harsh copy protection on it.  This means that you can't listen to it on your computer or MP3 player.  Every time I put the disc in my laptop, it crashes.  It is really annoying that I paid for this CD, and can't even listen to it while working or while at the gym.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I first heard of LOG on Uranium I think.  I didn't like them at that time because the song was from NAG.  But, on ATPB Randy Blythe changed his vocals and they became more growly and stead of screaming.  So, when I heard their single from ATPB, I was surprised that they were the same band as far as the vocals sounded. And I actually liked the song.  I picked up ATPB and I liked it, the pounding riffs, especially at the end of the final track was like a JACKHAMMER.  Till this day I like this album and this band sure embodies the \\"new american metal\\" slogan they have gotten.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots have always been, in my book, an essential band to rock. Lead by one of the best frontmen rock has seen in years you'd think that was all this band had going for it, but no. You also have a band that even outshine Scott at times, and that is saying a lot about how great this band is. In my mind I think if they were still together making music they'd be the rulers of their genre, God knows they were in the '90s alongside Pearl Jam. As for this CD, I can't find a single song I don't like. From beginning to end this is one of the best releases in over a decade. It's got the radio anthems (Vasoline, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty), and you've got the songs that didn't get airtime yet are still just as good as the singles (Meatplow, Lounge Fly, Unglued). If anyone doubted STP could top Core, they were proven wrong with this release.<br /><br />Starting with Meatplow was a wise decision, it bridges the gap between releases very well. Meatplow moves through the verses and choruses with ease, there's no slow point to this song. Vasoline is the reason I ended up getting this CD. At first it didn't sound like STP but after repeated listens it just gets into your head and you're stuck singing it to yourself days after hearing it. Lounge Fly is a pretty consistent song that stays stalled in between hard and light music. While the music is pretty hard throughout, Scott just sings throughout the song. I have no complaints though, I think his voice is perfect any way he uses it. Interstate Love Song has got to be one of my top ten favorite songs of all time. I've heard it an uncountable amount of times yet it still sounds fresh, like the day I heard it for the first time. I can't help of thinking of a summer day when I hear it. Pretty Penny is one of the best rock ballads I've heard in recent memory. Although it grows a bit stale over repeated listens the lyrics still beg your attention. I'm hardpressed to think of a song so touching. While Big Empty is a bit flat through the verses the chorus simply soars, Scott's voice has yet to be better. The lyrics aren't extremely good but the mood and way they are presented makes for a great song. Kitchenware & Candybars is, I feel, the best way to end this CD. It's not as hard hitting as Core was so there's no need to end with a song like Where The River Goes. No, just a brooding song dripping with emotion like Kitchenware does is more than you could ask for. It's only fitting that this CD ends this way too. The not so hidden track is a comedic listen at best, although I do wish they would've just faded out with Kitchenware. But no big complaints about it, it just reminds you that this is a band who enjoys making music.<br /><br />All in all my favorite songs are Meatplow, Vasoline, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty, and Kitchenware & Candybars. I feel that whether you like commercial rock or underground rock, whatever kind of music you listen to, you will be able to see the beauty this CD contains. Hands down, this is one of the best CDs of the 90s, not to mention STPs best. If you have yet to hear this then you should feel ashamed letting a gem like this go unheard.t flat through the verses the chorus simply soars, Scott's voice has yet to be better.

B0002S94OS|3.0|I do like this album, it has better production, thus the quality sounds better. And LOG have matured on this album with some of the greatest riffs going.  I can't compliment Morton and Adler enough and the rest of them.  But, some of the songs got political and were too long.  LOG jumping on the band wagon of politics/anti-Bush gets to me.  I don't support Bush, but I like to hear music to get away from the corrupt politics of America and the rest of the world.  NOT to hear about them on a LOG album.  And Randy Blythe squaking about how bad the Iraqi war is won't change anything.  LOG are using this \\"against Bush\\" theme like a gig, it is becoming their gig and cover...GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!.  I prefer As The Palaces Burn.  That album was real, AOTW isn't so real to me.
0634029355|2.0|I bought this DVD and I'm returning it.  The description and editorial review are misleading.  This is NOT a Clapton video.  Certainly some clips from Clapton, but generally this is a \\"how to\\" video.  Also applies to Clapton The Solo Years.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This takes hip-hop to a new level.  Kanye has broken away from the gangster bragging sell outs that have ruled it for the past 6 years.  This is new and it's hot.  His own production is incredible, and he revists the product he dropped for Jay-Z's 'The Blueprint', which was an incredibly hot album.  The best thing about Kanye is he raps about more important things than slapping women, shooting people in drug deals and buying bentleys.  'Jesus Walks', which is one of the top cuts from the album, establishes Kanye as a man who is very opinionated, and knows how to effectively deliver his opinions to the public.  Tight release, definitely pick it up.
B000AL730O|4.0|Paul is on a quiet roll.  If it takes a few listens to get into this CD, that's because it's a restrained, even stately effort, and not because it's pervaded by grating, sappy excess or frustrating near-misses.  Unlike the vast majority of Macca's albums, you can get into this one without having to be in denial about its shortcomings.  Up front, the bad news is that the album isn't very diverse stylistically.  Most of the songs are mid-tempo ballads, and are sung in that \\"mournful\\" voice that Paul seems to favor lately (cf. 1998's \\"Calico Skies\\").  This tends to create aural fatigue.<br /><br />But most of the news is positive.  There is virtually none of the MOR fluff and bombast that has plagued Paul's solo career.  His lyrics are refreshingly adequate, consise and frequently sharp.  And yes, the melodies here truly are as good as everyone is saying.  Maybe best of all, the arrangements and performances are exquisitely tasteful, bringing out the best in the songs.  Major kudos to Nigel Godrich for pushing Paul to excel.  Beatley flourishes abound, and they fit the songs well.  Nothing feels forced or excessively self-conscious.<br /><br />Are any of the new songs up to \\"Beatles standards\\"?  Actually, yes, as long as that is understood to mean \\"good Beatles\\" and not \\"great Beatles\\".  (And that's not just true for this album; everything since \\"Off The Ground\\" has had at least one great song, and there are several on \\"Driving Rain\\".)  Here, the songs start slow, but build with a euphonious elegance that leaves you wanting more, so you play them again, and hum them.  Some of these are bound to be at least minor classics, particularly tracks 5 through 7:  \\"Friends to Go\\", where he plays everything and doesn't waste a note (and gets back to the classic trick of ambiguous lyrics that somehow make sense); the fey but ironic \\"English Tea\\", with his best melody in years; and the heartfelt, gorgeous \\"Too Much Rain\\".  Also outstanding is the evocative closer \\"Anyway\\", with its hidden coda of studio snippets, just Paul doing the one-man-band thing... as usual, his \\"throwaways\\" are surprisingly good.  \\"Fine Line\\" is really good too (and shouldn't it constitute adequate penance for \\"Freedom\\"?).  The gentle, lounge-y \\"A Certain Softness\\" is another standout.  The penultimate ballad \\"This Never Happened Before\\" is really something: they used it in the film \\"The Lake House\\" and it was perfect.  It evokes the feel of \\"My Love\\", but with a lyrical and instrumental restraint more reminiscent of \\"And I Love Her\\".  Good, good stuff.<br /><br />Paul also is dark and moody side on a couple of tracks, a la \\"She's Given Up Talking\\" from \\"Driving Rain\\".  Really, all of the songs are very good or better in terms of melody and arrangement (other than \\"Jenny Wren\\", and that isn't bad).  Obviously, Paul's been through some rough times, and I wouldn't wish that one anyone, but at least he seems to be channeling his challenges into some great music.<br /><br />I consider myself an appreciative realist when it comes to McCartney's career.  I love the Beatles, and for a long time had the same love-hate relationship with Paul's solo stuff that many Beatles fans do.  With the exception of a few sterling tracks and near-greats, I just can't get into most of his post \\"Junior's Farm\\" (1974) stuff, although I came to like \\"London Town\\" and \\"Tug of War\\".  But he seems to be figuring out how to put the right pieces together again.  This one rewards repeated listening, which luckily doesn't require swallowing hard and overlooking the sappiness in order to get to the pop gems.  It's pretty easy to like as long as you don't mind his voiced, which has plainly aged, but is still expressive and has range.<br /><br />\\"Chaos\\", along with the less-melodic but deeper AND funner \\"Driving Rain\\", is a high point in Paul's catalog.  (Update: same with 2007's \\"Memory Almost Full\\", which is very upbeat.)  After too long in the wilderness, Paul is achieving a welcome and classy consistency that befits an artist of his stature.<br /><br />For context, my take on the other best solo Beatles records (sorted by ranking, then release date):<br /><br />5.0  All Things Must Pass<br />4.5:  Plastic Ono Band, Ram, Imagine, Band On The Run<br />4.0:  McCartney (1970), Walls And Bridges, London Town, George Harrison (1979), Double Fantasy, Cloud Nine, Driving Rain, Brainwashed, Chaos And Creation In The Backyard, Memory Almost Full<br />3.5:  Red Rose Speedway, Ringo (1973), Dark Horse, Venus and Mars, Tug of War, Flaming Pie, Off The Ground  (hon. mention: Ringo's Vertical Man is a solid 3)<br /><br />Cool how their later stuff holds up... this album isn't the only good one released by a middle-aged (or older) Beatle.  If only we could hear John's.<br /><br />(revised Jan. '13)
B00001QGPR|4.0|Another solid album from David Bowie.  If you grew up with his early stuff, it is hard to make the transition to his new attempts to break in to the modern market.  What he does manage to come up with is an album that doesnt stray much from his original theme, which is dance music meets old school bowie.   <br />Very listenable, and one of his best albums of the last 10 years.
B000AMJDHY|2.0|You could push this review to the bottom by voting it useless. You could ignore it, and go on ignorantly enjoying this type of music. But could you listen to the lyrics, and tell yourself that \\"yeah, this really is meaningful stuff\\". I've listened to every song on this album and not heard one positive message. I haven't heard one thing that could have any moral value to anyone, and this is the music that teaches our kids values. Unfortunately, somehow credibility goes hand in hand with how much a band rocks. Since these guys seem to rock, they've got credibility, and in turn the kids will say \\"Yeah, 'Is it still me that makes you sweat?'... That's what it's all about!\\" <br /> <br />Here's some music to prohibit kids from gaining any integrity. This is catchy music, I'll give it that, but unfortunately that's not what music is about. Buying this CD is the musical equivalent of buying a hummer for city driving. I give it two stars for lookin' heck-a-cool, but it looses 3 for it's lack of integrity.
B000084T18|5.0|This brings Gangster into the modern era.  I'm no longer a fan of 50 since his latest album, but this takes it back to his mixtape era, before he sold out, and before he had made it big.  His brags are believable when backed with the story of his shootings, his hustling and his gangster past.  A solid release, but one I doubt will ever be re-visited by the biggest sell-out of the last 10 years in any form of music.

0786890754|3.0|I bought this book to read on planes and in hotel rooms during my last vacation, and it fit the bill perfectly. Holly, the primary character in the book, is a young widow who has lost her husband, Gerry, far too soon to a terrible disease. Gerry, who knew that he was going to die, prepared a series of letters for Holly, with explicit instructions for her to follow each month for the entire first year after his death. Gerry has Holly sing at a karoke bar, get a new job, and holiday in Spain with her girlfriends. Each step brings Holly a little more back into her normal life, and by the end of the book, she's begun to deal with the loss of her husband.<br /><br />What's great about this book is that the story moves quickly along, with Holly's friends providing some hilarious comic relief. I remember several lines that made me laugh out loud. (After a night of drinking, Holly phones one of her married friends. Her friend replies, \\"My name is Sharon, I think . . . The man beside me in bed seems to think I know him.\\" Holly can hear Sharon's husband guffawing in the background.)<br /><br />This is not deep reading, and you won't be scratching your head or re-reading passages trying to tease out the author's meaning. But sometimes, that's exactly the kind of book I want. (Particularly when I'm lazing on the beach or languidly reading over afternoon coffee.) The book reads quickly, and I enjoyed every page.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|For an artiste to perform a 15 song-set live, it's no mean feat but neo-soul wonder Alicia Keys with her band (Onree Gill as musical director) and superb background vocalists manage to keep the beats going and the soul flowing. Unplugged gives no sense of the stripped-down minimalism that audience expected from live performance and instead her keen musical sense gives a richer sound production and colourful arrangement for most of the song pieces. Right from the start of strings-laden \\"Karma\\" to the grooves of \\"Heartburn\\", the enthusiasm is infectious. In a rework of Prince's \\"How Come You Don't Call Me\\", Key's staunch last cry will make you jump off your seat. \\"If I was your woman\\" and \\"If I ain't got you\\" are two lush ballads that speak heartfelt emotions. In \\"Fallin'\\" and \\"You Don't Know My Name\\", the arrangements in both even surpass the original. Keys plays it subtle in the affecting duet \\"Wild horses\\" with Adam Levine of Maroon 5 and bumps it up in the give-it-up recklessness of \\"Unbreakable\\". Mos Def and Common provide a befitting finish in \\"Love it or Leave it alone\\". This is the best unplugged CD in a long while. For music that appeals to the heart and mind, look no further - Alicia Keys has got the moves all right in this one.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|IT took a long time for um to do it but they finally gave McLintock the special treatment this version doesn't suffer from the out of focus problems that plague the original release. This was one of the first dvd's i had ever bought back when the players were 800 bucks <br /> <br />The Video: <br />THe video is in widescreen format which those movie lovers know is truly the only way to view a classic its beautiul for being 42 years old they did a nice job with it. It doesn't go out of focus like the original and stays true to the greatness of this movie <br /> <br />The Movie <br />Here we have john wayne in his best surrounded by a supporting cast including maureen ohara whom is the only woman who can go toe to toe with the duke and make beleive it. It takes the antics of a cattle baron and his wife troubles to the exteme. its as good as blazing saddles and doesn't use volguraity to do a rareity n any movie. The addition of Patrick Wayne his son and Yvonne De Carlo shows her talent as his mother in this film u will also notice jerry van dye among other in the cast to love <br /> <br />The audio <br />Suprisingly the 5.1 audo comes thru crisp and clean and no mainly front loaded. even the spanking goes surround sound very impressive for its age. The Comemntaries aren't bad they are interesting once to listen too <br /> <br /> <br />The Good <br />A Movie you can watch with your kids and not worry its funny its also cheap to buy and just a blast to watch <br /> <br />The Bad <br />Leonard Maltin why they are adding him to introduce movie is beyond me. It wouldn't be so bad but u have the option to view then u are forced to watch it at the start of the movie its annoying and completely just a waste of there money and our time i hope in the future they no longer use this though it is used in Hondo very annoying.
0684800713|5.0|I have read several of Ernest Hemingway's novels and he never fails to amaze me with his elegant prose. Both concise and detailed, his sentences seem choppy when separated from a passage but when strung together flow with aesthetic quality. And it is the simple beauty of not only the language with which he writes, but his ability to capture the human psyche perfectly within in each of his characters that makes this novel timeless. It has no need for the overly dramatic plots or climatic scenes that make modern novels so frivolous; the characters are all that is needed. Each one that was introduced into the plot was easily identifiable; I saw within each my best friend, my brother, and my neighbor, I knew exactly the types of people he wrote about. And it was this character interaction that kept the novel afloat. Whether it was Jack, Brett, Bill, or Mike's ever present drunken follies or the love triangles constantly being roused by Lady Ashley, Hemingway never missed an opportunity to comment on the lost generation; those poor, hapless souls, drained of hope and morality by the Great War, who drank away their years in Europe. With lost morality these friends loved, lived, and lost for a sunny week in Spain that helped reveal just how complex human relationships can be. Nothing was as subtly insightful though, as the underlying theme of the impotence affecting Jack which reveals that a loss to masculinity is not just physical but mental too.  <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemingway has once again created a masterpiece with his laconic, masculine prose that when vaguely skimmed appears elementary and choppy but when savored reveals it's wisdom and beauty. For prospective readers out there- pick up this book and love it for the subtle ways it reveals a grander meaning.  <br />
B0002PUH2Y|5.0|I love this cd. I saw her video \\"Malo\\" for the first time on Mun2, it was so simple, yet so powerful,her face, her voice, the pain wow!!!. Since that day I searched for her on itunes planning just to download one song, yet when I listened to the other clips there was not one bad song! so I ended buying the whole album and it was worth it. Finally a great new artist with original songs and great melodies... I am so tired of the Thalia's, Paulina's etc etc. that seem to take the most attention in the Spanish Media here in the US.  <br /> <br />Excellente Job BEBE.
B0008ISM40|5.0|You've read plenty of reviews on With Teeth and I'm among NIN's many fans. I have very little left to say about the album other than that it's excellent and a natural evolution for Trent Reznor. Afterall, you can only be so depressed and angry at the world before turning to look at yourself. Flow of ideas in the NIN catalogue goes from feeling victim of world (Pretty Hate Machine) to anger towards world (Downward Spiral) to hatred of world for mistreating people (Fragile).<br /><br />Now, With Teeth is about moving on to embracing yourself as being run over victim of world and not giving a fu** about it anymore. In some ways, Trent Reznor is more depressing while in other ways you can see that he's grown a lot stronger. I love the message he conveys of being destroyed by the world inside and out, but you still hold your own despite it all, by focusing on your inward self. Some critics have called his new album selfish and petulant but I think With Teeth is more about acknowledging pain and recognizing that you have to endure it. After Trent's drinking and drugs abuse, it can be said that With Teeth is about no longer using substances to filter out the pain in your life but that you have to take your pain raw and sober. By no means is any of the misery over, Trent Reznor is very true to NIN's hard rock roots, but that the person has changed and can take the world's blows a lot better.<br /><br />With Teeth definitely shows growth in the man and the band NIN. I don't see the album as a return to earlier albums. Rather, NIN's sound has always worked in a pop context and has always been pretty accessible if you gave it a shot. Any similarity to earlier albums exists only because it all originates from one brain. For example, The Collector has some notes that come directly from I'm Looking Forward to Joining You, Finally from The Fragile album. Reznor's brain does a lot of slicing and dicing but the end products always are different from earlier works. This is a solid album. At least one song on With Teeth will get you hooked so that you have to listen to it over and over again. All of the songs will grow on you as you have different moods each day. Lots of favorites are posted here and mine is Sunspots.<br /><br />But just remember, NIN has never been about happiness or uplifting spirits, it's about seeing the naked world in all its ugliness. If you're a happy go-lucky type, this album is not for you. Try playing the CD when you're having a bad day for example, this will bring you to the same place he stays everyday. This album is raw and with a biting edge (hence the name With Teeth), don't expect watered down or filtered emotion that can be spoon fed to the mass public - you have to be akin with Trent Reznor to tune into NIN's new sound. If anything, this album gives me a craving for NIN's new album, expected next year. I just can't get enough...bum.

0790734850|5.0|Many modern films attempt to duplicate the film noir genre (think \\"Mulholland Falls\\" or \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\") but none quite delivers the excitement, the believable plot, and the hard-boiled grit of \\"L.A. Confidential.\\"  This film nails the strange and potent combination of Hollywood decadence, police corruption, and racial tension which lived cheek by jowl with  the suburban atomic-age boosterism of mid-century LA.  You get a bird's eye view of it all, \\"Off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush.\\"<br /><br />The plot of the film has been well-described in other reviews, so I would like to explain why it is believable: much of it is a fictionalized account of events that actually happened.  James Ellroy, the author of the novels on which LA Confidential was based, has explained in an introduction to Jack Webb's book \\"The Badge,\\" that the book got him hooked on writing LAPD-based crime stories.  Many of the ficitionalized incidents in LA Confidential really occurred and are described in that book.  For example, as in the movie, there really was a \\"Bloody Christmas,\\" where police beat prisoners, and there really was a major scandal involving corruption in the vice squad. The scene at the \\"Nite Owl\\" cafe is similar to a real, sickening event at the \\"Mecca\\" bar.  Obviously, \\"Badge of Honor,\\" the television series in the movie, was \\"Dragnet,\\" which Webb made with the significant involvement of the LAPD; and everyone knows about Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner.<br /><br />Although I am a big film noir fan, I must admit that LA Confidential is better and more realistic than any post-war film noir.  For one thing, had this movie been made in 1952, there is no question that almost every actor would have been white -- even though Los Angeles at that time was nearly 50% minority.  Second, a film noir of the time would never show high-level corruption in the police force without making sure in the end that only the squeaky clean survived.<br /><br />Among other things, the DVD version of this film contains a nice interactive feature called \\"the LA of LA Confidential.\\"  Click on a location from the film, and you are told and shown exactly where it was filmed.  A very fun feature for those who know LA.<br /><br />Overall, a must see.  The best modern film noir, the best film of 1997 (the award went to Titanic, but this film is better), and one of the top 20 movies of all time.r things, the DVD version of this film contains a nice interactive feature called \\"the LA of LA Confidential.\\"  Click on a location from the film, and you are told and shown exactly where it was filmed.

B000002P72|5.0|Coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences, Blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:Soulful Blues, Drinking Blues and Guitar Blues. \\"B.B King - Live At The Regal\\" is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three. <br /> <br />This recording is dear to my heart as I can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother (God Bless) used to play this on 8-track. She used to love herself some Riley \\"Blues Brother\\" King. This recording ALWAYS seemed to be in the player when my cousins and I would come over to visit and rest assured, You WILL hear it before you left to go home. <br /> <br />At that time, Being the young naive kid that I was, I remember saying that I hated it and that it was old folks music. All grown up now, In an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on CDs, I have a newfound respect for real stuff like this. So instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating, You have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music....The Blues. <br /> <br />In my opinion, \\"BB King Live At The Regal\\" is one of Mr. King's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums, This is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like. Maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved. The arrangements were put together nicely & the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence. BB's pickin' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or BB King enthusiast.  <br /> <br />It sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted tohear good music while having a good time. The ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and BB was playing at his best. The only gripe I have about this disc is that it is very short; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in Blues (especially Blues Guitar). I recommend getting this and BB's \\"Live In Cook County Jail\\". They both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard. <br /> <br />Good choice if you get this one.
B000641ZA4|5.0|Seeing these brings back memories. It has been many years since I saw them on TV. These are better than what I had taped.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This was an excellent CD, a return to their alternative roots and an expansion of their talent.  It is supposed to be a rock opera, but being alternative rock stars, I am not certain they know what that is.  But the album is great!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead already rank as one of the greatest rock bands in history, so they could pretty much pack it up now and still be remembered as legends 50 years down the line. Since that's not going to happen anytime soon, we should listen again to their previous work in anticipation of their seventh studio album, due out some time next year. The band's sixth album arrived in June 2003 titled \\"Hail To The Thief.\\" A subliminal attack on Bush's America, the album was politically-charged and electrifyingly eerie in its attempts to warn us about a world crumbling in a post-September 11th world. The discontent and uncertainty of the entire global population is felt strongly on this album, as Thom Yorke uses very clever metaphors and imagery to express his anger.<br /><br />After Radiohead abandoned pure rock in 2000 to pursue lush, ambient electronica in \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Kid A,\\" this sixth record was supposed to blend the two together and return the band to the centre stage. I'm sure this wasn't the band's aim, more their record company. However, it didn't quite work that way. Hail To The Thief was a big seller, storming to No.1 in the UK and No.3 in America, but it didn't quite please fans. Some people love this album, while others simply don't. The people who don't are obviously people still hung up on the pure genius of \\"OK Computer.\\" This puts Radiohead in a very difficult position; everything they ever release in the future will be compared to that masterpiece.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"2 + 2 = 5 (The Lukewarm.).\\" This is a great opener, and runs for little over three minutes, so it's quite short. It has a stifled first couple of minutes but then explodes in a flurry of guitars and drum beats as Yorke screams, \\"You have not been paying attention!\\" It ends abruptly too, before giving away to the next song, \\"Sit Down. Stand Up. (Snakes & Ladders.)\\". This is an even better song than its predecessor, because it builds gradually over the course of four minutes, with a tinny pattering noise to start off with. Strange ambient echoes them creep in, as the song builds pace before turning into a grand epic in the last minute as rain comes cascading down.<br /><br />\\"Sail To The Moon. (Brush The Cobwebs Out Of The Sky.)\\" is one of the album's stand out tracks. This song is so evocative of a Van Gogh painting to me. I could just see a pitch black night sky in Paris, littered with stars and a full white moon. The piano is chunky and gorgeous here, and the vocal delivery is just dazzling. \\"Backdrifts. (Honeymoon Is Over.)\\" has one of the most ghostly, eerie intros I've ever heard. To me it sounds like the sound of water caught in a backdrift, funnily enough, rushing backwards at lightening speed. A light, tinkling piano dances across the frigid and desolate surface as Yorke gives one of his most brilliant vocal deliveries. I love the arrangement of his voice in this song, it's very stifled and suffocating. \\"Go To Sleep. (Little Man Being Erased.)\\" is a more guitar-orientated song, and has very precise vocals. This is a great song but I prefer other ones on the album.<br /><br />\\"Where I End And You Begin. (The Sky Is Falling In.)\\" is four and a half minute of pure catchy prog-rock! I love the beat to this song, it's kind of a mix between guitars, drums and electronic bleeps all rolled into one. The vocal delivery is chilling and the lyrics don't quite make sense, but this simply makes the ending all the more powerful, as Yorke seethes, \\"I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive!\\" The next song, \\"We Suck Young Blood. (Your Time Is Up.),\\" is rather bizarre and has a ghostly clapping beat that drags out like it has no life in it. The title of the song reflects the mood of the song: it's as if Yorke is sucking the blood out of whoever he's singing about, before the song miraculously changes pace in the middle, only to slow down again. \\"The Gloaming. (Softly Open Our Mouths In The Cold.) is another very brilliant song that opens with a strange inhaling noise, that is actually made with tape loops going faster and faster. It sounds so surreal and undulates over in your ears. Yorke's vocals are drawn out, like he's singing in a large hall or cave as insects crawl around him in search of a meal! It's a very cold song but ultimately works very well. An album highlight.<br /><br />\\"There There. (The Boney King Of Nowhere.)\\" was the album's first single and is probably the most commercial song on offer here. It's actually a very catchy song if you listen to it properly. The guitars and drums bounce off each other, until a great guitar solo comes in after 30 seconds. Yorke's vocals are very powerful as the song builds pace, especially at his awesome wail of \\"There there!\\" as the third minute approaches. It's the only time he sings it in the whole song and it sure stands out. The melodic guitar also comes in at 3:15 and becomes more effective at 3:57. A brilliant piece of work that pretty much goes catatonic in the final minute. Check out the video too, you'll be blown away. \\"I Will. (No Man's Land.)\\" is a short interlude of sorts, yet it's actually a great song as well. It's not even two minutes long, and almost sounds like a continuation of the album's third track. Yorke's vocals are grim and rather groggy, making for aural bliss. \\"A Punchup At A Wedding. (No No No No No No No No.)\\" has a catchy guitar riff that falls on itself, and a harmonious piano melody that builds over time. It's obvious to everyone that Yorke is using a wedding as a metaphor for something else. Whether that's political or social or perhaps even personal, we can be sure his intentions are to baffle the listener.<br /><br />\\"Myxomatosis. (Judge, Jury & Executioner.)\\" is another album highlight. It opens with an erratic prog redux that shows just how powerful melody can be when in Radiohead's capable hands. The vocals are mumbled yet suddenly clarify in the chorus as a melody comes in and takes over. Great track that has endlessly enduring appeal. \\"Scatterbrain. (As Dead As Leaves.)\\" is a more inspired piece with a crooning melody and guitars that evoke the first half of the album. There's a rather happy-go-lucky tone to this song, which is obviously a front for the darker subject matter that lurks beneath. The album closes on a high note with the brilliant \\"A Wolf At The Door. (It Girl. Rag Doll.). This is where Yorke lets most of his rage fly in a vocal delivery that is hopelessly indecipherable because of the stream of consciousness style adopted. The chorus is quite melodic and works very well in their Slavic jazz-blues approach that was explored in the latter half of the Amnesiac album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />I've had this album since January this year, and for some reason I just couldn't get into it! I'm not sure why exactly, Ii guess it's just because I hadn't listened to it properly. I had been frustrated with elements of Amnesiac that were resolved after repeated listening, but this album has 14 songs, and I felt it was perhaps too lengthy to attempt a proper listening. This album does, indeed, require repeated listens to fully absorb the wonderful music at play. I was initially going to give this album three stars, then four, but now it's a definite five out of five. Radiohead are a genius band, despite the criticism they receive from the ignorant reviewers on here. Hail To The Thief has a real message, a strong concept, beautiful music, great artwork and some stunning compositions. It's probably my second favourite Radiohead album, and that's pretty good going for a record I wasn't too fond of a few months ago.trange inhaling noise, that is actually made with tape loops going faster and faster.

0812975219|5.0|I came across the book while visiting San Francisco, and i think this is a \\"dangerous\\" book, in a sense that it will change the way you see success and randomness. I am now looking at people's successes in more \\"critical\\" way in the shadow of randomness. It has the similar effect as Osho change the way you see life and religion.<br /><br />This is a good book, in the gerne of Blink; Freakonomics; Coincidences,Chaos, and All That Math Jazz; and a host of other now-popular-psychology books. A lot of uncommon sense that happens around us. But this book has a persistent angle of \\"randomness\\" horizon to see things. Moderately easy to read.<br /><br />I have been an antrepreneur for 19 years and 9 months, and i have seen plenty of successes and failures, and chaos and growth and mess ( I live in Indonesia; natural rich country, with Economic crisis, corruptions, and Bombs etc)and I can feel a lot truth in the randomness that happen. We blame strategy and we praise skills when actually randomness is all that.<br /><br />I read about 5 to 10 books a month, and sometimes i think about a book more than others, the book change the way you see life, and the impact will change you as an individual. You will partly agree and partly disagree what the book said (similar to my view of Osho), but then, in the end, the books will still change you somehow. And this book is one of that few.<br /><br />Tanadi Santoso, Surabaya, Indonesia. 16 October 2005

B00006GO99|5.0|This is probaly the best record to go to if one needed to check out Thelonious Monk in a quartet setting, or any setting for that matter.  <br /> <br />Most Monk albums have a few of his classic tunes, and a few standards, and this album is no different. It sounds like Monk and the rest of the musicians were very on top with this recording. It's very well arranged, and everyone plays great. <br /> <br />I think one of Monk's best drummers was Frankie Dunlop, and he appears on this album. He had the perfect style for Monk's creative playing, more than Art Blakey and Roy Haynes had for him.  <br /> <br />Bye Ya, and Monk's Dream are too tunes that standout, and Bolivar Blues is another Monk classic. I dig them! This whole album is great.  <br /> <br />Another thing I realized while listening to this album is just how good a solo pianist Monk is. Sure, everybody knows he had a couple of solo albums out, but not many think of him as a great solo pianist.  <br /> <br />Certainly not the most ideal accompianist for a horn man, Monk is exciting and ingenious all the way. This is a classic recording!
B000AJJNPY|4.0|Sigur Ros has created yet another beautiful album. When I heard their last album (Von)I was disappointed, and speculated the releasing of Takk.  However, I was in love after just the first listen and decided to order it that same night. The intricate instruments blend harmoniously with the vocals in a lullaby fashion. The album is tranquil, like wind chimes on a summer night. I recommend this album to new and old listeners. Put it in, lay back, and close your eyes; you will not be disappointed.

0393327655|3.0|Sam Harris' book The End of Faith is, ostensibly, a book meant to dismantle the notion \\"faith\\" and \\"religion\\" in contemporary society. That is, he wishes to convince the reader to forego his belief in \\"ridiculous\\" religion and become a reasonable person.  I concur with Harris primary thesis that this is a most important change which needs to catch on in 21st Century society. However, the book that Harris has written might as well be called \\"an introduction to contemporary philosophy\\" for he often distracts himself with other philosophic issues that he feels a need to expound on.  <br />     In \\"The End of Faith\\" Harris covers the topics of religion/atheism, epistemology, meta-ethics, the mind/body problem and the phenomenology of the spirit.  Toss in a few non-philosophic chapters on the history of brutality in the Christian tradition as well as an analysis of contemporary Muslim and Christian faith and you get an idea of how far-reaching Harris' book attempts to be.  Instead of this breadth being a testimony to the grandness of the books goals, it actually hinders it.  As anyone who has read philosophy will know, arguments, to be truly convincing, most move slowly.  The counter-argument must be presented with total conviction to be adequately refuted.  Harris is not one to indulge in such a laborious methodology.  Religion is written off from page one as obviously illogical and unreasonable.  I agree totally with Harris that it is, but his deficit of counter-argument leaves me thinking that a true believer would have a hard time renouncing their faith in light of his writing.  No mention is made about the many philosophic arguments for the existence of God, and the refusal to address these famous counter-examples leaves his own argument weak.  Thomas Aquinas receives nary a word, nor does his ontological proof of God's Existence (considered the most well reasoned of all his \\"proofs\\"). Nor does Harris do much historical biblical scholarship--certainly learning about how the Bible was actually written, and it's historical place in Western Society could convince many readers of the Bible's invalidity.  Harris doesn't bother.  He is too busy.   <br />    Harris realizes that for many people, dare I say most, morality without religion is a total canard.  Of course anyone who has ever studied ethical theory knows that this is most surely not the case. Indeed, one could even argue that if morality is a canard than it simply is so, religion or no. Harris sketches out a bare bones ethical theory in the book; a theory that seems, on the surface, to represent a utilitarian perspective.  However, utilitarianism is never is directly discussed, nor is Kant and his categorical imperative, both of which are the basis for all contemporary ethical debate.  He regulates his decision to avoid these terms to a footnote, \\"the linkage between happiness and ethics (in Harris' writing) is not a mere endorsement of utilitarianism...I have elected to bypass the categories of moral theory that usually frame any discussion of ethics--utilitarianism and deontology being the most common. I do not believe that these categories are as conceptually distinct, or as useful, as their omnipresence in the literature suggests.\\" That is quite a claim about ethics he has made. Indeed, Harris is shrugging away 300 years (at least) of ethical theory with a mere footnote.  Perhaps I am being a tad hyperbolic but, it is clear that, more than his brevity on the subject, it is Harris' cavalier attitude toward the rigor of Philosophic argument that makes him an ultimately unconvincing writer.  If he, in the footnote, had explained that it was merely a matter of simplifying the subject for the reader, or keeping focused on his thesis that made him elect to bypass these traditional arguments about morality in the chapter the educated reader could move on.  Instead, he makes a rather ambitious claim about ethical theory, and then feels no need to argue for it.   This trulyis philosophic chauvinism.   <br />   I was also saddened by the fact that Harris' often spoke of including animals in our moral sphere as sentient creatures but never even suggested to the reader, even in a footnote, how such a view of morality might force a person to change some of their habits, particularly in regards to how we use them for food.  He does not even suggest further reading on the topic. I agree the book is not about such issues but, when Robert Nozick brought up the issue in \\"Anarchy, State, and Utopia,\\" it was not entirely germane to that books over-arching arguments either. Nozick nevertheless gave the reader more to ponder about the way in which we treat non-humans sentient creatures. If you are going to bring it up, then... <br />  The books last chapter deals with consciousness and problems with identity. Strangely, the chapter becomes an endorsement of Eastern philosophy and meditation.  Forceful claims are made about consciousness itself and he attempts to argue them in light of thinkers ranging from Buddha to Sartre.  Certainly Harris' is trying to offer the reader a rational spiritual alternative to dogmatic religious faith but the scope of this chapter is just too broad.  Not only does he criticize all of Western Philosophy since the days of the Greeks, he does so for their inability to recognize what he sees as the faultiness of normal subjective experience, that is the experience of the \\"I\\" in existence.   He endorses a Eastern view that through meditation one can experience consciousness without the \\"I\\" being present, that is to say, consciousness without the normal modalities of identity and subjectivity.  This is all fascinating stuff and his arguments for it seem relatively sound, if sketchy. However, by the time a person reads this chapter the focus of the book has lost nearly all it's coherence.  It would have served Harris better to write an entirely different book on this subject and keep \\"The End of Faith\\" about what it claimsto be about.   <br />  Despite my tirade of criticisms above, \\"The End of Faith\\" is still to be recommended.  In an age where theocracy is on the rise and books like the argument-free \\"Purpose Driven Life\\" sells millions (and \\"inspire\\" criminals to confess their sins), a book that endorses rationality and faithlessness is sorely needed.  For a better look at some thorough arguments against religion I recommend George H. Smith's well-argued \\"Atheism, the case against God,\\" or even Bertrand Russell's classic, \\"Why I am not a Christian.\\"  No doubt Harris' book is geared toward the masses and he would say that it is not a philosophy text.  If that was his goal, he has failed. He has written a philosophy book whether he likes it or not. It's just not a very well argued one.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|When George A. Romero first shocked moviegoers back in 1968, it was with \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", a dark, brutal zombie film saturated with atmospheric black and white cinematography and unflinching gore, which was quite unheard of at the time. <br /> <br />So audiences may have been somewhat suprised when they saw Romero's follow-up, \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" in 1978. The suspense factor has been turned down considerably, the eerie atmosphere (largely due to the gorgeous B&W cinematography) is all but gone, and the cynical commentary on human nature has been replaced with a rather different, though still somewhat cynical explication of mankind, which I'll get to later. <br /> <br />First, the story. \\"Dawn\\" supposedly takes place right after the events of \\"Night\\", even though Romero has made no effort to hide the progression of fashion from the '60s to the '70s. The film centers around four people: Francine (Ross), a headstrong woman trying to prove her worth; Stephen (Emge), a helicopter pilot and also Francine's boyfriend; Peter (Foree), a laid-back SWAT team member; and Roger (Reiniger), a rowdy and at times juvenile SWAT team member. After Francine and Stephen escape a chaotic TV studio and Peter and Roger survive a brutal raid, the four of them take to the sky in a chopper to find some kind of refuge from the ever-growing zombie epidemic that is engulfing the planet. What they find is a sprawling shopping mall that has been abandoned by everyone except a substantial amount of undead denizens. They land, grab some supplies, and, eventually, make the mall their home. <br /> <br />As I said earlier, \\"Night\\" featured some very cynical social commentary on human nature, but Romero has moved on to what's bugging him now: modern consumerism. The zombies in the mall are meant to represent the raving masses as they flock to shopping centers to buy things they don't need. This is made rather obvious at many points in the film, especially during this exchange: <br />-Francine: \\"What are they [the zombies] doing? Why do they come here [the mall]?\\" <br />-Stephen: \\"Some kind of instinct, memory of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives.\\" <br />Is there even any doubt as to what Romero was trying to say? <br /> <br />But don't worry, horror fans, for while Romero was layering in all his clever little metaphors and commentaries, he didn't forget the one important little element that makes \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" so infamous: gore. \\"Night\\" was nothing compared to this. We're talking graphic, unrelenting, envelope-destroying zombie carnage, complete with beheadings, disembowlings, and more than enough head-shots to go around, including one particularly memorable scene where a zombie loses his entire head due to a shotgun blast. While the blood itself looks extremely fake, Tom Savini's groundbreaking make-up effects more than make up for it. In fact, the candy-colored blood actually adds a certain indefinable something to the film, as it tends to focus more on macabre humor than actual horror and suspense. <br /> <br />The acting is cheesy and rather poor, but this IS a 1970s zombie film. The dialogue is at times decent and at times laughable (in a good way, sort of). The Goblin's score is, like the acting and dialogue, cheesy, but still manages to create a certain appeal. It grows on you, trust me. The direction is quite good most of the time and maintains a very cohesive visual feel throughout the 127 minute running time (or 139 if you're watching the extended version, or 119 if you're watching Dario Argento's cut). But the flaws I mentioned are minor and can most certainly be overlooked due to the film's good qualities, which are staggeringly high. <br /> <br />The recent surge of zombie films has yielded some good (28 Days Later) and some bad (Dawn of the Dead (2004)) results, but no modern film full of sprinting undead will ever surpass \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", a true classic and the quintessential zombie film that will reign supreme for years upon years to come. <br /> <br />9/10
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not a fan of space movies and TV shows, and I never got around to watching this show because I figured it wouldn't be that good since it got cancelled so early...I was wrong.  So I figured I'd finally give this a shot since they decided to make a movie out of it.  I think it's an awesome show, and it has definitely left me wanting more. <br /> <br />So don't just brush this off if you don't like typical futuristic space shows.  This is far from it.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|The recent surge of horror remakes has been replete with glossy, flashy movies full of generic scores mixed with meaningless nu-metal music, unoriginal storylines, carnage suitable only for cookie-cutter teen audiences, and the problem of taking themselves all too seriously. What's happened to the inventive, darkly funny horror films of yester-year, such as \\"The Evil Dead\\" and \\"Dead Alive\\"? Hollywood has all but forgotten what once made horror films great, but it seems that the UK is out to remind them. First with \\"28 Days Later\\", a film that put a new spin on the zombie genre, and now with \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", a hilarious romantic zombie comedy, or \\"rom-zom-com\\". <br /> <br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is about, well, Shaun (Pegg), a man who is at a crossroads in his life. He works a dead-end job, he lives with his slob of a best friend, Ed (Frost), and he was just dumped by his girlfriend of three years, Liz (Ashfield). In the midst of trying to sort all of this out, a zombie epidemic just happens to break out, and this only \\"exacerbates\\" things for him. <br /> <br />Right from the first frame, we get the feeling that this is a thoroughly complete horror comedy, as right away it features The Goblins' score for the original \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". The references to classic horror films and filmmakers just flow and flow constantly, as the film gives a nod to everything from Romero's \\"Dead\\" series (obviously) to \\"The Evil Dead\\" to Lucio Fulci. The way the film approaches the zombie invasion is extremely clever and well-handled, featuring several brilliant sequences, one of which shows Shaun routinely walking the streets of London on a perfectly average morning and then walking them again on the morning of the undead, or, dare I say it, the \\"dawn of the dead\\" (insert eye-roll here), without even noticing the difference. But what really makes the film outstanding is not just the horror element, but the fact that this would be a hysterical and wonderful film even without the zombie twist. The acting is excellent, especially from Simon Pegg, who delivers gags with perfect comic timing, pulls off heated confrontations expertly, and even nails the film's demanding emotional scenes (yes, there are demanding emotional scenes). <br /> <br />Not only does the film keep the laughs and the inventiveness flowing, but it also delivers what so many of the sleek Hollywood horror remakes of late have been forgetting: gore. It's complete with squirting blood, gushing bites, head-shots, and even a disembowling. Also, the ending, though something of a deus ex machina, is still extremely inventive and is most certainly a crowd pleaser. <br /> <br />Edward Wright (co-writer/director) and Simon Pegg (co-writer) have delivered a film that will satisfy the demands of horror purists, romantic comedy fans, and just about every other kind of moviegoer there is (except for maybe the teens that are in love with \\"The Grudge\\" and \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" (2004)), for it is truly a film that doesn't forget any of the elements of a great horror movie, comedy, or drama. <br /> <br />9/10
B00005JNJV|4.0|I am a big fan of the Batman movies becouse when I was a kid Batman was my favorite charactor. The first Batman movie was great and then Returns was pretty good but then Forever and Batman and Robin sucked. Now a complete new start to the franchise and what a way to start. The movie was great the acting was good the directing was good almost everything about this movie was good. There are some problems witht he movie I did not like Katie Holmes acting lots, I like to see more of the villians they could of done more with the scarcrow and finaly the movie was way to long almost 2 and half hours they could of cut some things out. I liked Micheal Cane and Morgan Freeman alot to great actors and they where relyl good in this. Overall a great film to start a new series Batman fans will not be disapointed.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Simply stated, Charlie Kaufman is one of the most talented, original presences in modern film. So far, he's delivered the strikingly innovative \\"Being John Malkovich\\", the quirky and amusing \\"Human Nature\\", and the vibrant masterpiece, \\"Adaptation\\". I find \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" to be somewhat more difficult to rate. I will tell you why later in the review. <br /> <br />First, the story. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a man heart-broken by the loss of his eccentric girlfriend, Clementine (Winslet). He finds out she underwent a controversial new procedure (offered by a company named Lacuna, Inc.) that erases a selected memory from the human brain. Her selected memory was the long, meaningful relationship between her and Joel, which came to a bitter end. After learning this, Joel impulsively decides to have the procedure done on him. The film then shows us what goes on inside Joel's head while two young Lacuna employees (Wood, Ruffalo) carry out the procedure. Joel relives his relationship with Clementine, revealing all of their most intimate moments and quirks, and in the process, realizes how much he loves her. He then attempts to hide from the memory erasure with Clementine, burying himself in his most humiliating memories, trying to save some memory of the woman he now does not want to forget about. <br /> <br />The film features wonderful performances from the entire cast, Carrey especially, who delivers arguably his best performance. The writing, of course, is top notch, Kaufman is a genius. The directing from former music video director Michel Gondry is teeming with life, vision, and personality. The film itself is absolutely excellent, as it perfectly portrays one of the most realistic, down-to-earth relationships ever conveyed through film, striking a delicate balance of joy and pain, revealing the couples most intimate and candid moments while never exploiting sex between the two characters. <br /> <br />Now, here's my dilemma in rating thisfilm. For some reason, I just don't love it like I feel I should. I don't know, for some reason it just doesn't connect with me like it does others. But this is just me personally. If I were rating this film on quality alone, I'd give it a 10/10. But since I rate films based on how much I like them, I give it an... <br /> <br />8/10

Everything about the movie is good the story, the excellent direction, the acting and the great score. The movie should of won best picture, director for Hitchcock, acting for Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. A great film that is still great to this day.
B00005JNTX|5.0|There has certainly been no shortage of comic book movies lately. From \\"Spider-Man\\" to \\"X-Men\\", for one reason or another, it just seems to be the current craze. Most of the films in this group are nothing but pointless Hollywood garbage full of drawn-out action sequences and cheesy dialogue. However, there are those select few that stand out. \\"Sin City\\" is one film does just about everything but get lost in the crowd. <br /> <br />The film, based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, follows three stories. One is about Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a \\"bum ticker\\" on the verge of retirement who rescues a little girl from a rapist with political ties (Stahl); one is about Marv (Rourke), an odd-looking man searching for the killer of his \\"true love\\", Goldie (King), a prostitute who slept with him and \\"was nice to him\\" - something no other woman had ever done; and the other is about Dwight (Owen), a man who aids a group of prostitutes in the murder of several men, which sends Old Town (a city run by prostitutes) into a war. And this is all tied together by several elements, including a prostitute waitress (Murphy) and a cannibalistic serial killer (Wood). <br /> <br />By now you've probably realized that \\"Sin City\\" isn't exactly a cookie-cutter PG-13 comic book movie, due to all the prostitutes, murder, and what-not. In fact, it's a violent pop-culture celebration, featuring one of the most remarkable casts in ages and being directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Frank Miller himself. <br /> <br />The film's visual element is undeniably fantastic, as it remains strikingly faithful to Miller's graphic novels. Using a gorgeous mix of black and white and strategically placed color, the film creates an atmosphere reminiscent of the classic noir films of the '30s and '40s while still maintaining a distinctly modern feel, and also moves at a deliberate pace, as it is loaded with snappy dialogue, clever editing, and over-the-top violence. <br /> <br />The film's only real flaw is its hit-and-miss acting, but I guess this may have been done somewhat on purpose, perhaps to further enforce the comic book element? Maybe, but I doubt it. <br /> <br />But that aside, \\"Sin City\\" is a truly great, original film that screams for numerous sequels, as it seems like it just has so much more to show us. It almost feels like this film is just an appetizer. Let's hope Rodriguez doesn't destroy the sequels to this wonderful instant classic, which is arguably the best comic book-to-film adaptation ever made. <br /> <br />9/10
B0009P42S2|3.0|I'm still learning the ropes when it comes to anime, which means I can't compare Steamboy to Katsuhiro Otomo's legendary Akira.  I can, however, say that I enjoyed Otomo's contribution to the film Memories more than I did Steamboy.  Both share the same kind of heavily industrial world of the past, cast in sepia-like tones reflecting an atmosphere of gloom.  That was more than okay for Memories' \\"Cannon Fodder,\\" but the world of Steamboy eventually grew tiresome to me.  The animation of this film is excellent, but it consisted of far too many scenes of exploding machinery, to the detriment of character development and storyline.  Frankly, I just didn't care about this plot all that much.<br /><br />You've got a young, inventive boy who finds himself in the middle of a conflict over the nature of science.  It's an argument that will erupt in loud, frightening chaos over the city of London.  The boy's name is Ray Steam, and steam is definitely the key word in all of this.  Ray receives a parcel from his grandfather containing an ultra-powerful \\"steamball,\\" and almost at once he's forced to honor his grandfather's request to keep it out of the hands of \\"the Foundation.\\"  His father, however, or at least a somewhat mechanized version of him, happens to be in cahoots with the Foundation, and he begins to win his son over to his own version of science.  He has used the vast power of steam to take his own father's vision of a Steam Castle and turn it into a well-armed weapon, complete with steam-powered flyers, subs, and mechanized fighters.  The grandfather, looking much the worse for wear, shows up to try and sabotage his evil son's efforts, and he confronts Ray with his own peaceful vision of science.  Fortunately for the audience, there's a spoiled little rich girl (by the name of Scarlett O'Hara - I kid you not) to add some life to all this philosophizing and artificiality.  The whole thing soon breaks down into a not-so-small war over London.  If you like explosions and scenes of utter destruction in your anime, you'll definitely want to check out Steamboy.  That's about all you'll find in the second half of the film.<br /><br />To me, Steamboy is a case of style over substance.  None of the characters are as fully developed as I would have liked, and the whole story never manages to take on very much depth.  Motion pictures, even anime, cannot live on cinematography alone if they want to be truly successful.  With its underdeveloped storyline, Steamboy just didn't prove satisfying to me.ns and scenes of utter destruction in your anime, you'll definitely want to check out Steamboy.

B000AARKW6|4.0|It seems like there is a point in many directors' careers when they feel the need to try and recreate a former glory they once had. This attempt usually results in a not-so-glorious film. Scorsese did it when he tried to practically remake \\"GoodFellas\\" with \\"Casino\\", Coppola did it when he made \\"The Godfather Part III\\", and De Palma did it when he made \\"Carlito's Way\\". <br /> <br />\\"Carlito's Way\\" is the story of Carlito Brigante (Pacino), a street gangster who is acquitted of a thirty-year sentence after just five years thanks to his weaselly lawyer (Penn). He then tries to make a legitimate life for himself by running a nightclub, but ties to his old friends sucks him unwillingly back into the criminal underworld. <br /> <br />The film is incredibly well made. De Palma has become a masterful director by 1993, and he showcases his full talent in \\"Carlito's Way\\". Every shot is thought-out and followed-through excellently, resulting in a film with perfect direction that maintains an extremely coherent visual feel throughout its 140+ minute running time. <br /> <br />So why only a B+? Well, the fact is that \\"Carlito's Way\\" is just not very original. There are multitudes of gangster films out there, and sometimes it's just hard for one to stand out. Also, as I stated earlier, De Palma is repeating himself. An ethnic gangster...a nightclub...Al Pacino...a life of sex, drugs, and violence...any of this ring a bell? Any of this sound suspiciously similar to \\"Scarface\\" (1983)? Although, this is something of an anti-\\"Scarface\\". <br /> <br />But all that aside, \\"Carlito's Way\\" is still a well made, thoroughly enjoyable crime film, and really, anything Al Pacino is involved in most likely warrants at least a viewing or two. <br /> <br />8/10

B00005JKG7|4.0|The quaint seaside community of Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th anniversary, but along with this revelry comes ghastly horror in the form of a thick, glowing fog that bears legions of murderous undead lepers with a vendetta against the residents of said community. <br /> <br />While viewing The Fog, I couldn't help but laugh at the sheer absurdity of the plot; watching people suddenly become afraid of fog when they really have no way of knowing that it's dangerous. Seeing people actually close their windows, lock their doors, and speedily flee from the fog in vehicles. Maybe it's just me, but if a thick fog engulfed my house, my first reaction probably wouldn't be one of terror. The story seems all the more ridiculous after summarizing it on paper (err, in an internet comment box). <br /> <br />However, John Carpenter has a talent for making potentially laughable stories into frightening, well-made films (Ahem, a certain steak-knife wielding psychopath wearing a William Shatner mask, anyone?). The Fog is no exception. Carpenter drenches the film in gorgeous ocean backdrops and a highly unnerving atmosphere that creates a tense, palpable sense of dread. From the first moments of the picture, the viewer is immersed in an eerily silent small town midnight when strange, frightening things begin to occur. This, like many other similar sequences in the film, works very effectively and probably would have faltered at the hands of a director not so well-suited to such a laid-back genre film. At 89 minutes, The Fog moves along at an appropriately brisk pace that does not stretch the entertainment value out of the relatively straightforward story. <br /> <br />The acting from such '70s/'80s staples as Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis is, for the most part, competently handled. The better performances include those of Tom Atkins and Hal Holbrook. By the way, notice the strange similarity between this cast and that of Creepshow? I don't know if there's any actual connection, but it's amusing nonetheless. Oh, and Psycho's Janet Leigh also makes an appearance. <br /> <br />The ending, at first, may seem sudden and anti-climactic, or it might even seem like something of a deus ex machina, but wait a couple more minutes, as Carpenter delivers a fun final \\"And by the way, SCREW YOU!\\" <br /> <br />Overall, The Fog is a frightening, heavily atmospheric, thoroughly enjoyable, and worthy horror film that, like almost every other classic horror movie that has been butchered, did not need to be remade. <br /> <br />8/10

6305252521|5.0|A must see.  A must own. <br /> <br />This movie is not only funny but mind and spirit probing as well.  Who knew that a Jim Carey movie would be philosophical?  My favorite parts are when Truman is a kid and that guy pops out of that Christmas gift beside the tree.  When Truman is escaping for the first time and the flash that fire on the road and THEN when he passes that they have those guys with giga-counters or whatever out there saying everything is radioactive.  When Truman is at the travel agent's office and there's that picture of an airplane being struck by lighting that is captioned \\"IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!\\"  When Truman goes into that building and sees the fake elevator and then leaves, smacking the electrician on the bottom with his briefcase as he learns that if he does anything unscripted that people pretend it didn't happen.  And how can I forget the part where he hears them play-by-play tracking his morning route over crossed signals on his way to work and almost hits that lady with the umbrella.  I could go on, of course, as this film is FILLED to the brim with stuff like this that is only amplified with Carey's personality which is ideal for this character really.

B00065MDRW|5.0|It's stunning to actually comprehend that this album was released in 1969. King Crimson was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY beyond their time on this album; both musically and lyrically. ITCOKC was very influential and innovative, mainly towards the genre of Progressive Rock, but also towards to the rest of the music industry.  It started the electronic age in music with the staggering \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\". <br /> <br />The album starts with the epic \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\"; possibly the greatest Progressive Rock song to the date. Also contains one of the greatest drum performances via Mike Giles, and a great guitar solo.  \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" is a timeless ballad, filled with a soothing woodwind section.  \\"Epitaph\\" is possibly the best song off of this album, and contains some of the most masterful lyrics that Peter Sinfield came to write. \\"Moonchild\\" starts off great, but then dives into some inaccessible-progressive-wackiness that may be hard to digest at first, but the jazzy guitaring sucks me right in. :).  \\"The Court of King Crimson\\" is the closing track, and it is a gem. Slightly uplifting, this track is a perfect album closer. <br /> <br />One of the greatest albums of all time.  If you listen to music with an open mind, then you will have no problem listening to, and thoroughly enjoying this album.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I started becoming a fan of FRIENDS when I picked up a simple one disc Best of Friends Vol 1.  I watch it, and then had to go get the other three that were out.  As soon as the seasons started being sold, I was first in line to buy them, one by one.  So you can imagine the money I have invested in them. <br /> <br />A friend of mine sent me the link to this page this morning and said \\"see what kind of money you could have saved\\".  My reply back to her was, yes I could have saved a ton of money had I waited to buy all 10 seasons at one time, however they have brought so many tears, laughs, and emotions to my life over the past 5 years that I have been a fan that I feel all the money I have invested in  them was worth every single penny!  How I miss the gang every week and feel that they could have continued on, but at least I know whenever I need that \\"dose\\" of FRIENDS, all I have to do is pop in a disc and they are right there with me.
B00005QXXO|3.0|When this album came out I had a very low opinion of it. \\"Why release an eight-track album at nearly full price?,\\" I wondered.  \\"Why leave off essential live tracks of the tour like 'You and Whose Army?' and 'Packt Like Sardines...'?\\"<br /><br />Well, I still don't know the answer to those questions, but these days, the album's tracklist seems very well chosen.  Every track included save Dollars and Cents is much different from its album version, making it essential listening for fans who first heard these tracks on album.<br /><br />Kid A tracks The National Anthem, Morning Bell, Idioteque, and Everything in its Right Place find a new dynamism live.  Though none is the best live version I've heard, they're all high quality performances.  Most notably, Everything in its Right Place begins with a revealing Peter Gabriel reference: \\"Here comes the flood,\\" and ends with incredible real-time remixing of Thom Yorke's vocals by Jonny Greenwood.<br /><br />It's the Amnesiac tracks, though, that make this album essential.  I Might Be Wrong, appearing in its original form as a driving rocker, includes the original lyrics from the coda, \\"the waves go out, come in again,\\" excised from the album version.  With the obfuscating studio work stripped away, Like Spinning Plates is exposed for the aching work of beauty it is.  Dollars and Cents sounds like any other version of Dollars and Cents, including the studio version -- it can't all be epiphany.<br /><br />True Love Waits, appearing here officially for the first time, is a good song, but a little insubstantial.  It feels like a Bends b-side, which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Be aware: The album was recorded very badly.  Bass, the key ingredient in several of the songs, is nonexistent.<br /><br />Low production values and short tracklist aside, this is an essential album for fans and a good sampler for the curious.  It could have been better, but it's not bad for what it is.<br /><br />An aside: I was lucky enough to be at the show this version of Like Spinning Plates is from -- the first time it was ever played live.  There had been rumors for months it would be played on the tour, but nobody knew for sure, and it hadn't happened yet.  Before launching into the piano intro, Thom said something along the lines of, \\"We're going to play a little game of 'Name That Tune' here.  Shout it out if you know what it is.\\"  On this record you'll hear people complying with his request.  A magic moment.he first time it was ever played live.

B0009I7NNA|1.0|I'm sick of hearing people call A7X a metal band. If you are confused at all about just what exactly this band is, let me help you out. This is NOT metal, I dont care if your MTV's Headbangers Ball c.d. says so.this is nothing more than punk rock posers trying to pass themselves off as metal to people who don't know any better. This band is a fraud. if you still like them, go download there music from one of those free sites(although I am not recommending illegal activity, it's just a figure of speech) but this band does not deserve support from anyone who is tricked into believing that this garbage is metal. Bands like this are the ones responsible for the pop/rock wave that is taking over the airwaves. If your going to but music, don't waste your hard earned money on this.
B00004XONN|5.0|this album is sooooooo great. It was only my 2nd example of their music, but from the first listen I was hooked. Just put on a pair of headphones, sit back and you will be transported to another world. Their music is perfect to lay around and mediate for me. This would be a great first purchase, then I recommend getting The Bends, and OK Computer. If you like long, floating journeys of sound then this album is for you.

B0001KZM3O|3.0|If almost anyone other than Gilmour, Mason, and Waters put this album out it probably would be considered edgy, and pretty damn good. From them, though, it feels a bit tired, like they are taking the PF name and sound to the studio with them and putting out something just to put out something. There's a lot of Waters' ego blasting from the speaker on this one. The band, uh, hit the wall on the previous studio work and probably should have stopped there. As always, Gilmour's guitar is astounding, but the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Waters' vocals are overwrought - though given the personal subject, some of that is acceptable. Of course, the entire CD is worth the price for just the quality of the sound and, especially, the first few seconds of the track \\"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert.\\" This isn't a PF CD to buy unless you're fairly hardcore and so looking to fill out your collection; otherwise, as much as I hate saying this, you might be better off sticking to their better known works or their earlier works from when the band was really coming together.
B000A6T1JU|2.0|When I purchase a directors cut, I expect to see additional scenes that where cut during original production. I don't want to see a bunch of new stuff thrown on top of an old movie so that they can call it a \\"special edition\\". While this DVD does have very interesting interviews with the actors and director, the newly added comic book style cut scenes are terrible. The new cut scenes total destroy the rhythm of the film, come on guys. My advice is rent this one for the interviews, but buy the original.
B000002UA2|5.0|This is a fun album. Different from the other work PF was doing at the time, with some pretty rock-ish tracks. The sound is, thus, a b it more pop than the two albums within which this one is sandwiched, but the musicianship is tight and flowing. For the real PF fan, this is an essential, especially when considered in historic content.
1558908323|5.0|Mimic is an extremely smart movie that respects the intelligence of its audience,and that may be its greatest downfall.<br />  I won't go into the atmosphere and effects, all of which are excellent. The other reviews here pretty much cover that gambit to good effect. It's a great horror flick, crawling with the sort of subtle and interesting touches that give good movies that 'something extra'. Not to mention an \\"abduction\\" scene that's guaranteed to scare the screaming bejeezus out of you.<br />  My peeve isn't with the movie itself, but rather with the \\"dumbed-down\\" advertising and descriptions that lead to all sorts of miscomprehensions in reviews, not to mention a couple of bad sequels that took off in a very-wrong direction.<br />  If one were to read and accept these reviews, and had any understanding of genetics or evolution, they'd be prone to dismiss the movie off-hand. Don't make that mistake. The story simply went over their head.<br />  This isn't a dumb monster flick. Much the opposite, it's so smart the copywriters and reviewers didn't \\"get\\" some of its more intelligent aspects.<br /><br />Just see it!
B000000OQF|5.0|if you like rock music, then your gonna love this album.  if you like music, then your gonna love this album. If you have a pulse, then your gonna love this album. <br />This is the best album I personally own--and you know it's a good album when you get excited listening to it. Every single song on this album rocks...it's diverse, just like the members of the band.  If captures raw power, anger, love, lust, angst---all those primal feelings...ways only Axl Rose can express them.  personally, I was too young when this album hit the scene (7 yrs) and it wasnt until Novemeber Rain hit the charts till I noticed who gnr was.  But it wasn't too late for me to capture their spirit---with the help of this album. Please, do urself a favour and pick up this classic yet contemporary album! <br />Oh, and if you work out/run, then this is highly recommended---it pumps you up!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah with her\\" come away with me\\" and Anoushka with her \\"Rise\\" will take over the music world. The Shankar sisters just rock. Well done girls!! You have done your father and mothers proud.
B000008GAC|5.0|if you like rock, then this is an album u havta have.  If you like music, then this is an album u havta have.  If you have a pulse, then this is an album u havta have.  <br />Basically this album should be owned by everyone who likes music and appreciates the art form.  This is obviously a classic album, yet is contemporary. You know its a good album when after x amount of years, and you still wanna listen to it.  I myself am a huge gnr fan.  I got into the music when November Rain hit the charts (I was a preteen then...oh and I suggest you do urself a favour and get those illusion albums). Anyways, AFD is the best album ever--I still listen to it till this very day, when I go out for my jogs.  If you are not familiar w/ the group, let me explain some things: the music is catchy, deep, raw, intense, violent, sweet, dance-able, all wrapped into one.  each and EVERY single track is an awsome song--it's like a greatest hits album!  This was their debut album (1987) and it was a shot in the arm to the stale hair bands of the 80s. Trust me, you will like it, and appreciate it for all it's worth.  All the members of the group played an integral part in the making of the best album of all time, and you will thank them for that!
B0007GAERG|1.0|It's hard to let go of the diva-greatness that used to be; therefore many people will literally buy into the hype behind this boring atrocity of a cd.KEEP my money, Mariah - I want the hour of my LIFE back! (Actually, I suffered through this garbage more than once just to make sure it was this cd and not my kitchen garbage that stunk so badly - and it was this poor excuse for music!) Even if it sells a BILLION - it's still CRAP!!!   Were the guest-artists good at what they do?Maybe - but that's good for THEIR cds.      Mariah's projects have always been brilliantly bigger and better than this childish caliber of weak and un-melodic excuses for songs and un-inspired computerized production.In fact, many barely learned preteens will be able to create better than this in their bedrooms with the Casio keyboard they'll get for Christmas!I don't blame Mariah. She has \\"People\\": These people USED to be proven Songwriters, expert Arrangers, and uncompromising Advisors that SHOULD have said, \\"The music AND the artists of this album are BENEATH you! STAY YOUR INCREDIBLE SELF, Mariah!\\"There's no doubt that Mariah Carey is still a great talent, but except for unit sales, her \\"people\\" have failed Mariah Carey; and the result is a sonic debacle of a project that could have been put to better use for that vocal-hack Fantasia.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather trilogy is, hands down, the best trilogy of all-time (in my opinion, at least). This trilogy has some of the best character development I've ever seen, as you see the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). From a war hero that had nothing to do with the family business, to a cold-blooded Mob boss.    The Godfather  The plot is kind of hard to explain here, as it keeps unfolding more and more throughout the duration of the film. But to sum it up, The Godfather is about \\"Don\\" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the head of a New York Mafia family. After the Don is shot, the rest of the family has to step in during a violent mob war. After Vito steps down, Michael (Pacino) is forced to stand in as the new \\"Don\\" (head of the family). Keep in mind, this is only my poor summary, as it's much more interesting than I'm making it sound. Also starring James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire (Adrian of Rocky fame)    This movie has been voted the #1 movie of all-time at [...] (it's not like they're the be-all, end-all of what's good and what isn't, but come on, 138,538 people can't be wrong!!), and is considered by most to be one of the 3 best movies ever. Needless to say, that's a lot of hype. Does it live up to it? Yes. The more I watch this, the more I like it. It's pretty much flawless in every way, and the twists & turns of the plot keep it entertaining. The end is so simple, yet so awesome at the same time. Of course, there's also good performances all around from the great cast. *****. Highly recommended to anyone who knows quality movies, and likes dramas.    The Godfather: Part II  In the 1950's, Don Michael Corleone attempts to expand the family business, and deals with an assassination attempt. In the end, Michael makes a ruthless decision that'll haunt him for the rest of his life. Also, we see how a young Vito Corleone (played by Robert De Niro) rose up from a petty breadmaker to the head of a Mob organization. The brilliant aspect of telling these two stories together is how they contrast so much. As Vito became more and more of a family man, Michael alienates himself with every decision he makes. Vito starts off alone and ends up surrounded by family and friends, while Michael starts off surrounded with family and friends, and ends up alone. I don't want to spoil too much here, but the end perfectly captures this message. Once again, something so simple can be so powerful at the same time. Most of the cast is the same, only Marlon Brando isn't in this one, and James Caan only has one scene (the flashback sequence at the end)    While not as good as the original, it's still an excellent film on it's own right. The only problem that I had is the fact that it's a lot slower than the first. While the original had a good plot that moved along nicely, Part II sort of stretched some storylines out a little. But, every scene is essential to the plot, and there's no real filler. Other than that, Pacino was fantastic here, probably his best performance yet. His acting was a huge step up from the first one (which is saying something, since he was pretty good in the first one). Robert De Niro was a nice addition ina role where 99% of his lines were done in Italian. Overall, a definite *****.    The Godfather: Part III  Taking place about 20 years after the last movie, a regretful Michael Corleone tries to legitimize the family business by joining with the Vatican and getting out of the violent mob underworld. He quickly learns that this is hard to do, as rivals such as Altobello (Eli Wallach, best known as Tuco from The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly) and Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna, voice of Fat Tony from The Simpsons) conflict things. Along the way, Michael has to deal with his fiery nephew (Andy Garcia), who's interested in his daughter (Sofia Coppola, daughter of director Francis Ford Coppola).    Okay, where do I begin? This is an uncalled for, un-needed, and unnecessary sequel. I suppose it's good for those that absolutely need closure, but Part III is not even in the same league as the first 2. The cousins as lovers was pointless, and just plain sick. Apart from Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire, none of the actors from the first 2 appear. But you know what the worst thing is about The Godfather part III? Sofia Coppola. Most fans agree: she definitely ruined this movie (okay, maybe I wouldn't go that far, but she ruined every scne she was in). She's just terrible in every way, and it's absolutely unforgivable to put her in such a big role. One of the worst casting decisions ever. Apart from that, Pacino gives his usual good performance, and Keaton does a nice job as well. Garcia is decent, but doesn't have the magic that James Caan and Robert Duvall before him had. Not to mention, he's put in a limited role, and never given a chance to fully display his angry side. Overall, I give this ***1/2. There are a few good scenes, but on the flip side, there are a few terrible scenes as well. To put it simply, this movie fails to really hold your interest. Unlike the last two, there are quite a few throwaway scenes (actually, everything with Garcia and Coppola interacting is throwaway). It feels like they stretched things out just so this could be around the 3 hour mark like the previous two. Slightly recommended, as the ending was great, but a real letdown nonetheless.
B000AL730O|5.0|This is one of the best albums Paul has ever done. <br />I love every song. <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Outstanding Performances by extremely talented women. David Downes did a fantastic job with the arrangements and as the musical director. I hope they put more of their performances on DVD.........I for one will continue to purchase and enjoy them. Thank You ........ Bob Diaz
B00068IOWM|5.0|I just wanted to add something seeing as the few reviews I did read were rather \\"blah\\" for lack of a better word! I think this album is a great album, mind you, like all of U2's albums, it took me awhile to get into it. But thats how it works, they keep mixing it up to keep themselves and the audience on their toes. Not sure about buying this super deluxe edition, but the album is a must for any U2 fan (hardcore or not).
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Not a typical Adam Sandler movie as for his character-he's not his typical Billy Madison, Happy Gilmour-self but it is still a funny movie. The reoccurring McDonald's \\"cheeseburger\\" character was hilarious. If a wrestling fan you will notice 3 wrestlers in it-Stone Cold Steve Austin, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash. The football game was action packed. Besides being funny it was 100% entertaining and well worth the admission. The movie itself was about 2 hours long and not being a big fan of MTV itself they did do a great job of making this movie.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Did some critic or other say this movie is boring? THis movie stretches the boundary of Vanity Projects! Pointless self indulgence comes to mind. If you're into celebrity skin then probably this is for you but then again I'm even seriously thinking is this DVD worth the space in my collection?
B00006F7S4|5.0|Not everybody will have the kind of emotional connection I instantly had to this album.<br /><br />The very first chord of this CD conveys the message of the whole album: meloncholy, somber, but, most importantly, hopeful. Every word of misery has an undertone of hope. Every \\"this sucks\\" has its own \\"but itll get better.\\" Thats why this album is so perfect for a time of emotional desolation. Its sympathetic, but assuring.<br /><br />This emotional breadth layed over a wonderful musical background. Complex, interesting string arrangements, intriguing chord progressions; just interesting, fascinating music, as is the norm for Beck.<br /><br />The music is good, so thats kind of trivial. Whats most important is the emotional anguish obviously eating at Beck on this record. If you can feel this emotion, you'll get something out of this album.
B00005JNTX|4.0|The film adaptation of Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" graphic novel is one of the strangest film experiences ever. The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.<br /><br />However, the plotting is weak. The four stories that encompass the movie are too short, and when one ends, we immeadiately jump into another one. For a normal film-goer, this could make it a confusing movie.<br /><br />Another draw-back is that the film is just too graphic. Some of the violent images are needless, and seriously detract from the film.<br /><br />The acting is good, though. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King and Jessica Alba give some of their best performances to date.<br /><br />Overall, this is a strange-but-good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B
0451191153|3.0|I enjoyed Atlas Shrugged - which I read first - and to a lesser extent The Fountainhead. My feelings about these two novels can be best be summed up by what my sister once said about White Castle burgers: they're good in a sick kind of way. Whereas Rand really hit it out of the park with Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead lacks a conflict we can care about and protagonists that act in ways that make sense. It really seems like Rand wrote Atlas Shrugged with an eye toward correcting the mistakes made in The Fountainhead. With the exception of being somewhat overwritten, Atlas Shrugged is superior in every way.           Howard Roark is a brilliant architect who is so dedicated to his progressive modern style he is willing to starve rather than compromise his art. He doesn't do compromise or design by committee. So far, so good. He meets the fabulously wealthy Dominique Francon and they fall into that hyper-intense state of psychotic love that only Rand characters can achieve. At this point everyone should live happily ever after - but if they did we wouldn't have a story and besides, these two are crazy-stupid. More accurately, Howard makes a couple of really stupid decisions that complicate his life needlessly and Dominique is just plain nuts.      Howard is too stupid to realize that by marrying Dominique he could have the love of his life and also be able to pay his electric bill, thus making his unwillingness to compromise much easier. But his big bonehead move comes when he allows his design for a government housing project to be submitted under another architect's name - with the nonnegotiable condition that no changes be made to the design. Expecting to get your design through government red tape without changes is ridiculous - government, after all, being the ultimate example of decision by committee. Suffice it to say, he's no John Galt.     Dominique is so crazy that she decides to dedicate her whole life to destroying herself because one of Howard's buildings is mutilated by its owner, even though Howard moves on with his life without giving the matter a second thought. She marries two men whom she despises, sublimating her real self to become a Stepford wife. As the image of a Rand woman, she isn't fit to hold Dagny Taggart's dirty underwear.    Rand uses the conflict of bold, progressive architectural design versus the staid, classical style favored by the majority to argue for her belief in individualism over collectivism. I'm all for individualism, but it's hard to get too worked up about the creeping influence of collectivism in architecture. Who cares? In Atlas Shrugged the collectivists were literally killing the country with their policies, something that doesn't seem possible to achieve through architecture.    Skip this one and read Atlas Shrugged.
B000065PUE|5.0|if you dont already own this album, buy it now.  hands down one of the top 5 albums EVER made.  im not kidding. buy two copies and give one to a stranger.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Outstanding CD! Wonderful songs, wonderful artist, it will be on my all time favorites list.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is an odd movie, cataloged as a comedy and much like Accidental Tourist is actually not a comedy or even funny but very entertaining. <br />Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind explores memory, but unlike Memento and Identity, no one is phychotic yet this movie has similar qualities as those two movies and has a validity to it although the premise is impossible in reality. <br />Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a realistic love story with the dissapointement one can expect from real relationships. <br />The lovers come to realize they had, at one time rejected each other....... <br />You have to see it to understand what I mean by that last statement.
B00097A5HW|5.0|A totally different Shakira on this CD.  It certainly shows her diversity in music and singing abilities.  Most definately Sharika,  she is truly skilled in a blend of north-south-east-west pop and folk.  Can't wait to buy her next project!
B0002858YS|5.0|I'm a 48 year old femaile, and try as I might to keep up with what's happening musically, sometimes I fall short. This was one of those times. I'd seen The Killers mentioned in numerous music mags, and paid no attention whatsoever. I'd heard \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and loved it, but never bothered to find out who sang it. I'd written them off as just another one of the \\"The\\" bands, (of which there are WAY too many, in my rapidly-approaching old-age opinion).  <br /> <br />Marty Casey from Rock Star: Inxs changed all that for me. His rendition of Mr. Brightside, as well as his specific mention of The Killers and Franz Ferdinand opened my eyes and ears. I bought Hot Fuss and have been playing it incessantly. I absolutely LOVE it. I haven't been able to say that about any CD in quite a while. THANK YOU, MARTY!!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I saw this movie becuase so many people said it was hysterical.  Perhaps I just don't get their idea of funny.  I do not think it is funny to laugh at someone so pathetic, it feels like bullying to me.  I felt his pain, but mostly this move was like a train wreck, only one that I could look away from.  I am forever grateful for my fast forward button.  I got the jist of the movie without all the long tedious pathetic scenes.<br /><br />But the dancing at the end was funny.  People could watch that.  Skip the rest.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|First a few words on presentation. The audio and video are fantastic. The camera work is great and on the musicians %99 of the time. I've been frustrated with other concert videos, when the camera panned to the audience at a crucial moment in the performance, not so here. Another plus is the perfectly timed use of the split screen, which allows the viewer to see all three musicians (and not just the soloist) up close simultaneously. This is a great technique also used to great effect in \\"Woodstock\\". Also, the best performances are drawn from the four night engagement. The editing is great and the concert flows with continuity.<br /><br />Now to the music. What a Treat. Each of these guys has truely  attained a master level of musicianship. My eyes and ears were glued to the screen for the entire concert but especially for Spoonful, Sleepy Time Time, and Badge. Then I was completely blown away by high powered blues of Stormy Monday and Born Under a Bad Sign. Baker, Bruce and Clapton take it to another level on Stormy Monday (my personal favorite). I watched in awe as Clapton closed his eyes and leaned back to deliver a series of searing blues riffs, all the while Bruce is busy digging into his Gibson fretless bass and kicking up his leg to emphasis his point. Ginger Baker's Toad is pure bliss. I replayed Toad four times in a row the first night I got the DVD. By the fourth time my seven year old daughter came into the room, looked at was happening on the screen and promptly exclaimed, \\"wow, they're good.\\" Yes, I said they are the Cream.<br /><br />Enjoy, this DVD captures a truely historic event. This music transends boundries and will appeal to all fans of great music.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|If a zero rating were possible, I would give this pathetic film that rating. It is beyond boring; it is beyond depressing; it is beyond bad acting and the most unlikeable characters ever created in fiction. There is nothing to like about this film....if you can stay awake... oh yes, I can see this film as a great sleep drug. The only film I hated as much as this one was Rushmore. I am a person who loves independent films and IFC is virtually the only channel I watch on TV, so I am not looking for Hollywood crap. In summary this film has nothing going for it and I cannot imagine anyone liking it for any reason.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|First thing,I have never gotten the clapton is god thing.I have always bought his solo stuff,only to turn around and sell it.Never listened to cream.But,after one listen to this,I now understand why people went nuts for clapton.And,now,I am looking to go buy all the cream and bluesbreakers and derek stuff I can find.I have never heard him play like this,and I dont really give a rats behind if it compares or not to what went on 40 years ago.I do know his new cd makes a great frisbee.
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|Paramore is not the first to go down the road that Fueled by Ramen offers to other pop-punk/emo acts succh as the hugely successful fallout boy and The widely acclaimed \\"The academy is...\\"  Lately this label has been introducing to us a slew of new bands in that genre.  The list goes on and on:  Panic at the disco, Days Away, Gym Class Heros, and more.  Paramore finds itself among these bands.  Sure, they might become the next Fallout Boy if they play their cards right, and they Female singer might have as many guys looking at her as there are girls swooning over \\"the acedemy is'... Singer.  But the real question here is:  Do these kids sound good? <br /> <br />The CD opens up with the strong \\"all we know\\"  The chorus makes for a very catchy opener that instantly delivers.  It's already evident at this point of the recording that this band has a great Rythm section.  There's also a nice solo in this song.   <br /> <br />Pressure, the second track is another great song.  Probably better than \\"all We know\\"  The riffs on this song rock.   <br />Probably one of my favorite tracks is \\"brighter\\"  It's got the slow sad verse and then a dynamic chorus that's just executed well.  Hayley's amazing vocal range is well showcased in this song.  The remainder of the CD has some pretty diverse tracks.  There are a lot of mixed emotions on this CD, ranging from homesickness to heartbreak and conspiracy.  There are only a couple of tracks here that I don't care for.  Other than that, this CD rocks pretty good, with a vibe that says clearly: a am pop rock...with some punk here and there. <br /> <br />I can't help thinking though, this band has a lot of growing to do.  First off, the guitarist sings well, but not enough.  They need to find more parts for him to dual with hayley.  Also, the lyrics are a bit shallow.  They do touch on deeper moods here, but nothing too deep.  I say if they can fix these things up, and a few sound tweaks, they'd be much better. <br /> <br />So in a nutshell, this is a pop-punk band with rock elements mixed in.  The production is great, they are quite catchy, and they have a girl singer, which is far too rare in this genre.  So what are you waiting for...  Buy it! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00079FUI6|1.0|I'm sorry but this is just one huge commercialized Series.  The acting an writing are hideous, along with the fact that it is a dumbed down version of a much more brilliant show Twin Peaks.  When you have two cast members of the show, in character, advertising Sprite Plus, you know this is a DESPERATE grab at money.  The quality is very poor, but it seems as if the audience doesn't care.  After all they have been lowered over the past 4 years with the reality craze.  The new craze?  Stupid non-reality.  Do your self a favor and pick up seasons one and two of Arrested Development, funniest show in the history of television with brilliant writing/acting/plot.  You will die lauging-me and my friends do all the time.
1891252089|5.0|I've reviewed most ashtanga books out there,and this is by far the best!!! The fact that it can sit on the floor with the spiral binding is a real bonus to any student or teacher.I really like how Mr. Swenson gives options to many poses giving accessability to everyone that can't stretch like \\"Gumby\\".Highly Recommended!
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden's self-titled first album, released in 1980, was truly a trendsetter in what at the time was an emerging genre. While this was not their breakthrough record, it started them off on an aggressive note that gave them the foundation for their more polished works in later years.  <br /> <br />All the pieces seemed to fit together for this recording session. At this period of time, heavy metal had not strictly been defined. Thus, the songs burn with a fierce energy, and the band seemed more interested firing out a unique style rather then trying to \\"conform\\" to a certain established sound. The singer at the time, Paul Di'Anno, who would be gone after their second album \\"Killers\\", was the perfect compliment to their early approach. He could sing in this rough, raw tone, at times sounding like a possessed demon, while at other times singing in this serene, beautiful manner. Steve Harris, the bassist, was (and always has been) a monster on the bass, and the guitars (Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton) were uncompromising and uninhibited.  <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, well, many tracks off this album (six out of nine) turned into frequent concert staples. Not bad for one album. Iron Maiden proved from the get-go that they could play as hard as any band around, and yet do it with passion, musical expertise (with amazing compositions), and even some sentiment. A couple tracks show a heartfelt lighter side. Listen to Strange World. Absolutely beautiful! <br /> <br />There is a magic to this album that could never be recaptured (by Maiden or any other band). The early time period, the emerging sound of faster metal, and the rawness of the band, all collectively joined to create a special piece in musical history. I would recommend the album, not only to fans of metal, but to anyone with an appreciation for all types of music. Sit back and let yourself mentally drift to a small club in 1980. You'll feel like you're really there. <br />
B00003CXAE|5.0|Grease is without a doubt the best movie in the world. Perhaps my crush on John Travoltra rates it higher in my opinion, but I am postive that everybody who has seen it agrees with it's perfect cast and enjoyful songs and lyrics. I believe that this movie earns more than just 5 stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I seldom review movies or DVDs, however this one deserved my praise.  Let me start by saying that I only saw one show on fox (The Train Job) and thought it was a one-shot fill in.  I thought it was great and hoped that they would make it a permenant series. Since it appeared to be pre-empted by sporting events several times and moved to different timeslots, one could come to the conclusion that fox for some reason, possibly the quick advertising buck of sports events, chose to go the economic route rather than allow the fan base to develop for this show. I believe this to be the case based on the overall sucess of the series and the film. (in my opinion)  <br /> <br />Now in saying it had something for everone, I shall now elaborate (Spoiler alert) <br /> <br />1.  This show had genuine character chemistry. You did get the feeling that the characters really did care about each other. They had disagreements, they had fights, one hit another over the head with a big wrench when a betrayal took place. In short, you could see where this group of people could be like a close knit family. Ron Glass (Preacher) said in one of the extra features that when the group came together on the set it was like one big family, and it showed. <br /> <br />2. This show was FUNNY. I found myself laughing at the characters and what they did, said, or did'nt do. I watched the episode over again and was still laughing.  What made it great is that I could see myself  doing the exact same thing in the situation.  It was not unrealistically funny, but funny in a way that most people probably would do the same thing.  For example the doctors reaction in Jaynestown. <br /> <br />3. Romance - (Spoiler) - Ok the Captain and the Companion, and the mechanic and the doctor, the near misses, the ovious attractions, the crushing disappointments, the endless possibilites.  Is there anything more that can be said ? <br /> <br />4. Culture - The combination of English and Chinese laungauges was first rateand possible profetic. The current demographic studies show that Chinese will eventually be spoken by more people in the world then any other launguage.  The blending of cultures over time is a historical fact, this show gives up a possible looking into our culture future. <br /> <br />5. Action, Drama - The crew of the Serenity are basically mercenaries with hearts willing to do almost anything to survive in a world not of there chosing (like we all are). This brings them into confict with both the elements of criminal organizations and goverment groups. You can use your imagination on this one, however not all problems are settled with guns.  <br /> <br /> <br />So what it comes down to is that this has something for everyone, I have even hooked my collegues at work on this series. It is a series worth watching and owning, it has all the appeals that make a true classic.  My hope is that future movies or another TV series will be produced after the phenominal sucess of the DVDs and movie. <br /> <br />
B000B5XOYI|2.0|I love Seal, so why no music video. There's everything else. I'm very dissapointed. other extras are ok I guess.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The third part of the Harry Potter series is better than its predecessors, but still lacks the emotional resonance of other literary adaptations (e.g. \\"Lord of the Rings\\").  Moments of awe abound, but the plot and sub-plots seem disjointed and superficial.  The problem is still the source book.  Rowling books contain a series of peaks to be digested in several sitting sessions, each chapter or group of chapters being sometimes radically different adventures that together conform a plot.  Those books don't have the scope of Tolkien work, or the movie-minded shallowness of, say, Dan Brown's \\"The DaVinci Code\\". So, their translation to the screen present progression problems that Cuaron hasn't solved.
B00005YU1O|5.0|\\"Waking Life\\" requires more than one viewing in order to \\"get it\\".  This is a very dense discussion of a wide range of issues regarding consciousness, both waking and dream.  It considers the trajectory of evolution of consciousness, and suggest where we might be going.  The nature of our physical world, and it's relationship to consciousness, is the next big frontier facing humanity, if we expect to survive another century.  This DVD sketches out the scope of the issue.
B0002DKCMG|3.0|Fun, fun, fun.  An excuse to jokes, and well done at that.  But like all this kind of films, in the end is a conservative call for a united family and the one-girlfriend forever style of life of the Fifties.  Self conscious, to say the least (\\"well, there you have your R Rating\\") but with a bland hero and the tendency to abandon suicidal (and interesting) leanings and falls in the way of normalcy (Eastern Europe and the sisters, the Papal incident, etc).  A little bit serious, longer and bolder, and this would have been an interesting satire.
B000B8I8X2|3.0|Three and a half stars<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Roadrunner Records, and not a fan of compilations/tribute albums/soundtracks.  Needless to say, I was a bit hesitant when I first heard of this anniversary collection, but when I heard the concept/process behind it, I was quite intrigued.<br /><br />And what you end up with here is a disc of some great tracks, and some tracks I'd rather not hear again in my lifetime.  Let's get this straight, you would be much better off first spending your money on recent Roadrunner artist's individual albums.  Soulfly, Opeth, Machine Head, Fear Factory, Trivium, and even Slipknot, who I'm not a huge fan of, have released Roadrunner albums which blow this CD away.<br /><br />Having said that, I know that most of you metalheads out there probably have these albums, and if that is the case, then it is definitely worth your money to check this out for the music and the collector's appeal.<br /><br />At its strongest points, Roadrunner United demonstrates why this label was, and continues to be such an important player in the landscape of metal.  \\"In the Fire\\", led by King Diamond is a great melodic thrash piece with soaring solos, the traditionally dynamic Diamond vocals, and manic drumming.  \\"Dawn of a Golden Age\\" brings some much needed extremity to the album in the form of heavily melodic black metal, and while I am not a big fan of the genre, I love the composition and riffage of this brutal track.  \\"Baptized in the Redemption\\" is another standout track with fierce vocals and blistering ryhthms.  \\"Roads\\" is a slower-acoustic track, but with the incomparable Mikael Akerfeldt leading the way with the vocals, and well-composed instrumentation including some classical violin, this is one of the highlights on the album, even if it only clocks in a little over two minutes.  The traditional hard-rock/metal sound of \\"Blood and Flames\\", and infectious neck-breaking thrash of \\"Constitution Down\\" round out this album's bright spots.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks can be described along the range of \\"good, but not memorable\\" to \\"outright lame and unfit to be on a metal release.\\"  As for the latter description, the silly and uninspired pop-punk \\"No Way Out\\" and Velvet Revolver clone \\"Tired N' Lonely\\" will never convince me that they belong on an anniversary collection for an important metal label.  And sorry, the completely forgettable \\"The End\\" sounds more like something you would hear on VH1's top 20 countdown rather than on the extremely diluted, yet at least heavy metal themed Headbanger's Ball.<br /><br />Aside from these abysmal tracks, the others are certainly worth a spin, but with such great material released in the metal world this year (Opeth, Nevermore, Soulfly, God Forbid, YOB, Pelican, Arcturus, Between the Buried and Me, The Black Dahlia Murder, Biomechanical, Cephalic Carnage, Meshuggah, Gorod, Yyrkoon...ok, I think we get the point) I predict that I will only throw this CD on for the standout tracks mentioned at the beginning of the review.  Again, if you have yet to pick up the slew of great metal albums released this year, I would suggest making that your priority.  For the rest of you headbangers, pick this one up for its historical significance and for the truly spectacular instances when this brilliant, and mostly successful, idea really hits the mark.. <br /> <br />The rest of the tracks can be described along the range of \\"good, but not memorable\\" to \\"outright lame and unfit to be on a metal release.\\"  As for the latter description, the silly and uninspired pop-punk \\"No Way Out\\" and Velvet Revolver clone \\"Tired N' Lonely\\" will never convince me that they belong on an anniversary collection for an important metal label.

B0002KVUKM|2.0|I don't know why people vilified this movie so much.  Probably because of the cheap CGI (like in \\"Mummy Returns\\").  The story is stupid, the action sequences over the top, and all is irrelevant, but is fun nevertheless, and every action (even the stupidly impossible ones) is sliced in understandable bits of information (that is more that you can say about so many Hollywood films these days).  Is a grandiose \\"B\\" movie (or rather a \\"direct to video\\" film) with a budget closer to \\"Titanic\\" than to \\"Re-Animator\\".  But I will continue viewing Sommers' films, if he manages to slow down and acquire a better technique using the overblown effects that he likes.  In the summer of 2004, two of my hopes for the pop-corn film (Sommers and Twohy) had failed (or at least that's what the public, the critics and the B.O. dictaminated).  What went wrong?

B00005ATQH|4.0|Unrelenting black comedy with Peter Sellers tormenting James Mason over his decision to do everything to go out with a nubile teenager with her own agenda (Ah, from here comes the \\"new woman\\", so manipulative, so destructive of societal bonds!).

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|This is certainly worth picking up.Daron comes to the forefront of the microphone a little more but it truly works within the context of the music.The key standout tracks include: <br />Question! <br />Sad Statue <br />Violent Pornography <br />Lost in Hollywood <br />Radio/Video <br />There are no filler tracks.Its a great buy.I think the emphasis on this CD is more in the balanced vein of sweeping/soaring harmonies which in delivers on in subtle spades.This is a more pop friendly CD then say, their self titled but it proves not to be a bad thing.Its not brutal or musically dense like that disc but it still provides its own catharitic power, especially when dealing with humanity's wrestlings with dark and troubling themes like war,pornography,global pursuit and..war again.Some really beautiful moments amid the cascading sonic din.Its not a stone cold hard musical excercise in politics for those unitiated to the musical agenda and thematics of SOAD like say, Rage against the Machine.It primarily deals with themes most all of us have experienced whether indirectly or directly.A strong musical and emotional offering only to be slightly outdone by the upcoming Hypnotize(its volume 2 counterpart).
B000B5XOYI|3.0|Compiling the first four Batman films, which as a previous reviewer noted both helped resurrect comic to film adaptations and nearly kill them as well, the Batman Anthology is better left on the shelf and the Special Editions of the first two films are the only ones worth purchasing.  The first film, released in 1989 and directed by Tim Burton, cast Michael Keaton as a brooding Dark Knight trying to save Gotham City from the diabolical Joker (Jack Nicholson) while wooing reporter Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger).  This first film was revolutionary in it's tone and delivery when first released, and it hasn't aged very well, but the page it takes out of Frank Miller's classic Dark Knight Returns helps seperate it from the campy television series, which is why it became the blockbuster it did.  Nicholson was perfectly cast as the Joker, and his performance will go down in history as one of, if not the, best comic book villains of all time.  The second film, Batman Returns, was released in 1992 with Burton in the director's chair again and Keaton reprising his role and this time taking on the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the sexy Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) as well as a crooked mayor (Christopher Walken).  Batman Returns was one of the few super hero sequels that managed to successfully capture the spirit of the first film, and be it's equal as well.  The third film, Batman Forever, saw Joel Schumacher take over as director, and Val Kilmer dawning the cape & cowl this time around to take on the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (an overacting Tommy Lee Jones).  Bats is also joined for the first time by Robin (Chris O'Donnell) as he woos the beautiful Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman).  This film was a split between critics and fans alike, as the dark tone is pretty much gone and replaced by an uber-campiness, but it's nowhere near as bad as what would follow it.  1997' Batman & Robin is arguably the worst comic to film adaptation of all time, with Schumacher back at the helm and the miscasting of George Clooney as Batman, with Chris O'Donnell returning as Robin, and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.  They take on Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), but before you get to that point you'll be wondering how this piece of crud ever got greenlit.  Each film has been re-released in Two-Disc Special Editions with an assortment of extras, but this box set features no exclusive features itself.  If you're a Bat-fan, then you already know to skip this set and just buy the first two (and maybe the third depending on how much you liked it) instead of getting this.nd the miscasting of George Clooney as Batman, with Chris O'Donnell returning as Robin, and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.

B000AL730O|3.0|I put the CD in the player and waited. The high never came The days of Wings and my encounter with the lads from the balcony of the Hammersmith Odeon in 1965 is how I remember Paul. <br />Redemption however is possible. At 56 I am raving to the songs of Simple Plan and Green Day that blast from the bedrooms of my three teenagers. \\"Holiday,\\" by Green Day should bear the same influence on Paul as Muddy Waters did way back when.

B00005R62K|2.0|I consider myself a Priest fan. The new cd \\"Angel of Retribution\\" really inspired me to complete my Priest collection (well, up to '84's DOTF anyway) I had two left to buy; Sin After Sin and this. Maybe it was a mistake to buy these at the same time, Sin is just so much better and a 5 star cd which actually surprised me quite a bit! <br /> <br />Stained Class has a very, almost cheesy and thin chorus effect running through most of it, the riffs are fairly weak, and the production is tight but uneven. It does oddly enough contain 2 five star tracks and they are of course, Better By You, and Beyond the Realms... the rest is mostly filler. It seems maybe nostalgia is just too powerful a thing for people to distance themselves from the product but I cannot for the life of me figure out why people love Exciter so much, it just seems very generic to me and for people that do not like Judas Priest, Exciter is the perfect example of what I'm sure they would expect. Stained Class, Invader, and Savage are \\"fair\\" but hey, when we are talking Priest, that doesn't cut it, and don't even get me started on \\"White Heat... Red Hot\\"... groan.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|OK, first of all this is my all time favorite show. if you realy listen to the music and and the lyrics the whole story unfolds. all the songs are great except for \\"something baaaaaad\\" its realy baaaaad and \\"A Sentimental Man\\" but other than that its great. in defying gravity when idina goes up in the air i get the most powerful feeling. its amazing. i hope you enjoy it too
B000AARKOO|3.0|The cinematography was fabulously done, costuming, acting WOW and general plot line was riveting.  <br /> <br />However, snarl snarl... my main gripe with the movie stems not from the overly nice treatment of Islam, which provided only the good half of Islamic experience and some nuances that could easily be lost to the viewer who knows little of Islamic life style and culture.  The concern is with the excessively heavy handed and one sided presentation of European Christianity (Roman Catholicism). The European Church of this period, which was essentially one unified Church, (pre protestants, pre reformers, pre rosaries, pre born-againism), with both negative and positive aspects. The movie misses the reality of the pageantry and religious practices of the Christians. The only prayers shown are the corporate prayers of the Muslims.  <br /> <br />Christians of the period would have had community based services with Divine Office (up until Vatican II the Latin 7 times a day prayers of the \\"Orders\\".... those Templars.. and fervent Believers), pageants, plays, processions through towns with icons, and other religious symbols. The Churches were extremely ornate, the movie ends with one empty room with one bronze cross that Saladin puts back on a table. Bull-cookies! The Churches of Jerusalem would have had a strong influence of the Orthodox (the third group of Believers of the Book slaughtered by the European Christians with the Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem). The Churches and Holy Sites would have been (and still are today) covered with carvings, statues, stonework, Icons of Saints, or Christ. Icons covered in gold gilt, encrusted with precious stones. The intensity of awe inspiring beauty, the bling-bling, of the Church was in strict contrast to the crappy life of the average poor half starved peasantry. The Church's faade represents paradise of Heaven the power of God.  The movie never once even shows a Eucharistic, smells and bells, service the central pillar of thehistoric Christian faith.  The Dome of the Rock (A Muslim Holy Site) was of equal stature, the majesty or bling-bling of the Islamic architecture also is to show the Glory of God to the masses, which in turn is the hope of Paradise, for Muslims that lived crappy half starved peasant lives.  <br /> <br />The differences in life and faith practice between the Muslims and Christians would have been a fantastic showing similarities and differences. But no this movie and the corresponding A&E and History Channel documentaries are definitely against Christianity.  <br /> <br />One leaves the movie thinking what they are supposed to, the Kingdom of Heaven is a slick propaganda piece that shows everyone why they should hate Christians today and especially those who follow the practices of the Historical Christian Church. <br />  <br />One final thought regarding the martyrdom that the movie espouses. A martyr is killed by a person of a different faith, that requires a Muslim to be killed for the sake of being Muslim by a non-Muslim, and conversely a Christian killed by a non-Christian for believing in the Christ, both faiths would have had the same teaching at that time. Martyrdom was like a first class ticket to Paradise / Heaven. My point here, is the priest toward the end who advocates conversion to Islam, was a plant for the propagandistic message of the movie, Christians and in particular the historic - 2000 year old faith and practice - Christians of Europe suck and had no real Faith. <br /> <br />I would suspect that the lack of commercial success is due to not so subtle Christian bashing.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|This DVD is awesome.  The animation is spectacular and the story is totally believable. This is a classic.
B000AL730O|4.0|If you are a McCartney fan you'll enjoy \\"Choas\\". Paul's writing is a bit dark and subdued but very melodic. It took a couple of listens to get the feel of the album but I get the sense that he put alot of effort into this one and it basically shows where he is at today at age 63. Definitely worth a serious listen.
B000002KEV|5.0|This is probably the greatest live rock performance ever captured, so it rates five stars. Thank God, these guys never took themselves too seriously...a lot of riffs similar to Zeppelin, but they thankfully lack Zeppelin's ridiculous pretensions to seriousness. Lazy, Smoke on the Water, and Space Truckin stand out here. They're masterpieces. They're also ridiculous, juvenile, and self-indulgent. The vocals are great. If you are any kind of rock fan, you need to own this thing.
B00005JLWN|5.0|What aspect of a film designates it as \\"excellent?\\" <br /> <br />Is it eye-grabbing action? Heart-pounding drama and suspense? Wonderful acting? Well-organized plot? Never-before-seen bits of entertainment? <br /> <br />Equilibrium just so happens to have all of this. <br /> <br />It starts by taking a few aspects from the revolutionary film, The Matrix. Then it blends these aspects with bits of another revolutionary work, Fahrenheit 451. <br /> <br />The result is this film. Bale and his fellow actors nail everything down perfectly. The plot is undeniably intriguing and gripping. And one can--and should--NOT miss the action of Equilibrium.  <br /> <br />You will all but forget The Matrix.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Of course it doesn't hurt that Kill Bill (volumes 1 and 2) is one (or two, rather) of my favorite movies. But the soundtrack is simply superb. Only the RZA tracks were written for the movie. The rest of the music is vintage stuff that Quentin plucked from obscurity to use in his movie. However, as is the case with all of Tarantino's soundtracks, the music forever becomes associated with the film. For example, will you ever be able to hear \\"Stuck In The Middle With You\\" without thinking of Michael Madsen slashing a cop's ear? Dick Dale's \\"Misirlou\\", of course, is already irrevocably linked to Pulp Fiction. You won't be able to hear Bobby Womack's \\"Across 110th Street\\" without thinking of Jackie Brown.  <br /> <br />The songs on the Kill Bill soundtrack are so utterly perfect, that it's mind-boggling. Of course, you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it. I feel that Kill Bill is one of the most perfect marriages of image and music to ever come out of Hollywood. Just on Volume 1 alone, you've got tracks like \\"The Grande Duel\\", \\"Battle Without Honor or Humanity\\" and \\"The Lonely Shepherd\\" that are so perfect in the movie that you would that they were written for the movie. But they weren't. Just imagine that climactic duel between Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu without \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". It would not be the same.  <br /> <br />I think that the Kill Bill soundtrack is one of the most perfect non-score soundtracks ever. It's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's genius that he is able to perfectly assemble music to complement his images and still make highly listenable soundtrack albums. The Volume 2 soundtrack is equally excellent and features such gems as Chingon's \\"Malaguena Salerosa\\", Shivaree's \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and lots of Ennio Morricone. Highly recommended.
B000001OAA|5.0|I CANT SPEAK ON ANYONE ELSES BEHALF, BUT AS FOR MY OWN OPINION I THINK GARBAGE IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPEND TO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. PERIOD! SHIRLEY MANSONS STRENTH AND INTELLIGENTS COMES ACROSS VERY STRONG IN HER LYRICS. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE GARBAGE FAN MYSELF. I FIND MYSELF CRAVING THIER MUSIC ON A DAILY BASIS. THIER SOUND IS SOOOO INFECTIOUS. I HAVE TURNED AVID ROCK HATERS INTO COMPLETE GARBAGE ADDICTS! AND I LOVE IT!!!! EVERY TIME THEY RELEASE A NEW ALBUM I FIND MYSELF TOTALLY INTRANSED BY SHIRLEYS VOICE. AND THEY ALWAYS LEAVE ME WANTING MORE.I SUGGEST CHECKING OUT ANGEL FISH.AN ALBUM PUT OUT BY A BAND IN WHICH SHIRLEY MANSON WAS A MEMBER BEFORE SHE WAS WITH GARBAGE.
B000AARKOO|3.0|A good, certainly not great film. <br />I expected more from Ridley Scott. <br />The story kept jumping around & left you hanging about what was going on with the characters. <br />What was the story behind Balian & Sibylla?  I did not understand this side story at all. <br />Orlando did a good job. <br /> <br />DVD wise, I had trouble with disc 2 accessing all the features. <br />
B00006AW2M|4.0|It is interesting that this album is generally judged in reference to Sgt. Pepper. Admittedly, the Stones were occasionally playing catch-up music during the burgeoning cultural landscape of the latter part of the sixties. This album, however, does not warrant a lot of the neat, pigeon hole dismissal it has faced over the years. The only regrettable moment comes in the form of Sing This All Together(See What Happens). A poor man's version of the musical climax perfected in 'A Day In The Life'. Elsewhere, the flowery psychedelia and potent rock'n'roll crunch meet with a consistency of compositional strength. Classic tracks such as 2000 Light Years From Home, She's A Rainbow and 2000 Man exist comfortably next to the album's lesser known tracks. <br />Pepper is still the more cogent expression of 'spirit of 67 grandiosity' but time has bridged what was once considered a chasm between them.
B0009IW88A|3.0|I am not going to lie by saying I wasn't excited about the fact that Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard were going to compose the music for \\"Batman Begins\\".  In fact, I enjoyed it when I heard it in the movie.  On this album, however, I was kinda disappointed.  Really.<br /><br />For starters, I was expecting a lot of action music on this CD, but I have to settle with 'Eptesicus', 'Myotis', and 'Molossus'; in fact, I believe those tracks are the best points in here.  However, I wonder where the rest of the action went.  I was also hoping for a better representation of the love theme, but it's so scattered all over this album.  The rest of the music on this CD is just noise.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the \\"Batman Begins\\" album is a fine listen, there are little important moments to hold on to, not to mention a stronger theme, instead of a two-note motif.  I'm glad there are more coherent and better structured BatCDs out there, like Danny Elfman's \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns; Elliot Goldenthal's \\"Batman Forever\\"; and Shirley Walker's \\"Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm\\".  Let's hope an expanded edition of the \\"Batman Begins\\" is released some day in the future, and let's see if we get a better representation of this music score, which was written for a movie that is, in my own personal opinion, the best movie of 2005 so far.
B0000024VP|4.0|This is one of the more evocative records in my collection. Many of the tunes benefit from the lush string and harpsichord adornments that, some of the more pop'n'roll tracks aside, conjure a misty, medieval feel. I was a little curious as to the editorial comment from Roy Francis Kasten with reference to the Pennebaker film 'Don't Look Back'. For a kickoff, it was Donovan who requested that Dylan play 'It's All Over Now, Baby Blue' as opposed to it being a pointed 'put down' on Dylan's behalf. As for the metaphorical disappearing into the wallpaper, maybe that was part of the DVD special features 'cos I don't recall it.
6305212112|5.0|My husband had been asking me to watch this movie with him for years - it was one of his favorites (from before we met), even though he continually called it a \\"chick flick\\"...  I was hesitant to watch it because I had the idea that it would be a sad movie - and I just don't like movies that leave me blubbering & saddened for the rest of the day.<br /><br />However, last weekend we finally sat down and watched it together, and I was pleasantly surprised!  Although there was 1 or 2 parts that led me to cry, it was not what I would categorize as a \\"sad\\" movie - in fact, when I really think about it, it was quite uplifting...<br /><br />\\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" weaves the life experiences of 3 very different women - 2 of them lived their youth about 50 or 60 years ago, and one is currently 40 something years old.<br /><br />The story revolves around an \\"old\\" woman who is sharing her & her friends life experiences with the younger, 40-something woman.  This younger woman is quite depressed, feeling like a weakling who doesn't really matter.  She gains strength and a will to really LIVE through the stories shared with her.  Spending time with the \\"old woman\\" becomes an important, life changing event for her - helping her to step-up and be the woman she truly wants to be.<br /><br />This movie shows the importance of being willing to listen & learn from others - as well as the wealth of knowledge & experience that our elderly population has - if only we would take the time to engage them in discussion & listen to what they have to offer.<br /><br />Overall, I give this movie \\"2 thumbs up\\"!  If you're at all interested in human growth, and the \\"good old days\\", then this movie's for you!
B000AL730Y|5.0|Short and to the point as I can get. The New Album should get a grammy and Mac fans should shout that out loud to the award committee. I am sick of the Mac writers who still talk about \\"Silly Love Songs\\" If you have ever seen him he Rocks out at 63 yrs old better than most every artist mumbling lyrics out there today! Helter Skelter live is Mac and always has been a major part of who he is!(Nothing silly seeing this done live) This album is the closests to a Beatles album since their demise. This decade so far has seen him deliver several solid noteworthy albums and nothing short of  several GREAT tours with outstanding Rocking performances! GIve this guy a break and get off the press releases from the early 70's Knocking him down because of dissappointments over the Beatles breaking up!  he has earned it. His last several years alone is more than most artist ever contribuite! Enough! from the BULL pen. If you dont like his music thats fine and fair but give the guy his due! Mac is one of the greatest of the Century. Few musicians have done more! Mac Rock on , Its time for RESPECT with no reservations. Mac fans should unite and scream this out loud. This guy is flat out amazing! A Grammy I say with him on the Show performing HELTER SKELTER LIVE for the young one's to see what all the fuss was and still is about!
B000001ESP|5.0|A phenomenol display of musicianship and production.  RUSH really proved the depth of their artistic ability here.  Even if you don't like RUSH you would appreciate this album.  The terry brown and RUSH production team works well here.  Geddy Lee's vocal range is unparalleled along with his incredible bass and keyboard playing.  In this album geddy lee uses alot of bass riffs that substitute a rhythm guitar section.  His keyboard playing is also well balanced with alex lifeson's guitar playing.  Neil Peart's drumming is crisp and technically superior to all. The drum acoustics are also well balanced with the rest of the sound.  Alex Lifeson's playing is also incredible.  He uses so many unorthodox guitar riffs and patterns.  I think the thing I like about this album is the constant change of rhythm and pace in the songs.  There are very few 4/4 beat songs on this CD which is refreshing because most popular rock albums are in 4/4, 8/8, or 16 times.  This is the album that got me into RUSH.  Yeah, there's the standards Tom Saywer and Limelight.  You also need to listen to YYZ, Red Barchetta, and the Camera Eye.  This album was far superior to anything else in 1981 or all that preceded it.  The production value is phenomenol and should be used as a scale for all albums to compete.
B00005JNTX|4.0|It is hard to explain in words what kind of film,...... \\"Sin City\\" is !!! I could probably best explain it like this,... it has the outline of \\"Pulp Fiction\\", the style of \\"The Matrix\\", the darkness and gritty feel of the \\"Spawn\\" comic series; with a bit of a horror feel like \\"Friday the 13th\\", and the Jason and Freddy films during some parts. With bit of a \\"Punisher\\" feel as well, if you take a look in the movie. It also has the whole innovative comic like feel of \\"Hell Boy\\". Let me tell you if you saw the \\"Kill Bill\\" films; and thought that they weren't bizzare or violent enough. Chances are I probably just confused you and/or gave you a headache, but if you watch the film you'll see what I mean by all that.<br /><br /> The film is based on Frank Miller's creation of the original \\"Sin City\\" graphic novels; with help from great directors(Tarantino, Rodriguez). Before, I watched the film I didn't real know what to aspect or hope for until, well I started watching the movie. I love the CGI animation, and the whole comic book feel. I never would of guessed that they were going to make a movie like \\"Pulp Fiction\\". If you never seen \\"Pulp Fiction\\", the set up is like this. You get multiple stories from different characters, and throughout the movie they will show how each of their different stories or points of view coincide into each other to form a circle which is called a story.In this film you'll hear the main tales of the old cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a rogue named Dwight (Clive Owen), and a big tough guy named Marv (Mickey Rourke); living in Basin city which is ran by a crooked gangster like major leaving the city in his dark shadow. I think that the black and white look makes it fell like an old gangster film; with a bit of imangination. There are many other charcters as well like Jessica Alba, Brittney Murphy, Eliah Wood, Devon Aoki, and some others.<br /><br /> Hartigan(Willis) is an old cop on the verge of retriment; with some heart issues. He is up in years, but still as tough as ever. Hartigan is out on one last job, he must save a little girl from a mad rapist, who turns out to be the major's son. The major is crooked and of course has many connections; and would make his life a living hell if he attempts to save her. So he has a choice, save the girl and throw away the rest of his life or he can walk away!!! Hartigan can't just leave that poor little girl in the hands of a maniac, so he confronts him in a fierce battle. In the end he does save the girl; and manages to wound the major's son, but then he himself is shot up pretty badly and he thinks to himself \\"An old man dies a little girl lives.... fair trade.\\" then the film fades into the next story.<br /><br /> Marv(Rourke) is a tough guy; with a rough past is out for vengenace after Goldie(a hooker) is murdered. He wants answers, and is willing to kill his way to find answers. Marv is more like character like the \\"Punisher\\" a dark hero. Marv is obviously the most rememberable character. He doesn't seem to be afraid of anything; he in fact is able to take out 13 or 14 cops single handedly; thats what I mean by Matrix style. He even takes Eliah Wood's character a psho cannibal boy and manages to cut all his limbs off and feeds it to a wolf; which kind of tells you that this is no Pg 13 Marvel super hero film, and you probably already got the idea by the title of the film; and believe me nudity galore. This film is very dark and gritty with a ganster feel.<br /><br /> Then you get to Dwight's tale (Owen) who is plainly a rogue. Who is pissed off at some guy who has been getting a little too clos to his girl(Murphy). He teaches him a bit of a lesson, but not sastified. He goes after him, and chases him into the other side of town, which is ruled by a bunch of wild Amazon like hookers; with assault weapons,.... boy oh boy. Well, they end up taking care of the guy; but he turns out to be an under cover cop. This act would indeed cause a war between the Hookersand cops led by the dark (King Pin like character) in a civil war. THat's pretty much where the creativity part comes in. He must destroy the edvidence, but on the way he runs into a lot of trouble. He must face rouge mercenaries, and must spill blood with his Amazon friends.<br /><br /> Hartigan(Willis) is far from done yet though, he finds himself in jail being framed for the crime; he though refuses to testify, and keeps recieving letters from the little girl who keeps her idenity secret. He eventually gives in, after a bluff and he stops recieving letters from her. After 7 years he's back and he is able to track down her who has really grown up and turns out to be (Jessica Alba); he must save her from the mysterious looking man who turns out to be the major's son once again. Basically, Hartigan is the hero like redemption story and must finish what he started years ago.<br /><br /> The world of Basin city is very complex and explict \\"Sin City\\" is very, stylish and entertaining film. \\"Sin City\\" though is a little darker for some people's tastes so you'll either absolutely love the film or absolutely hate the movie. THis film is awesome; it's just amazing to me that they were able to combind 3 graphic novels into an awesome combo such as this. 2 hours of fun. Yet, it's no \\"Pulp Fiction\\" by any means, and very different that anybody that saw the movie expected it to be.<br /><br /> Overall I will give this film a 4/5, a great film with loads of style. \\"Two Thumbs Up!!!\\"<br /><br />Acting: 5/5 I loved all the characters but especially Rourke's character, that character was pretty much made for him and heck Willis is an expert at playing the role of a cop; just see the Die Hard films.<br /><br />Presentation: 5/5! Loved the comic book style, with the Matrix/ Pulp Fiction feel. Like I said nothing quite like this not by a long shot. Absolutely loved the black and white gangster/underground feel as well!!! Kudos to (Tarantino, Rodriguez) and the creator Frank Miller.<br /><br />Showtime Value: 4/5 Great film!!! Very, fun to watch and is great buy for comic book fans or people who like action and violence and such. The film though is rated r fo a reason and may be to dark for some people. There were no bonus features as well. The film itself is a great buy for the right people.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5<br /><br />-Rogue Fox \\"Rogue\\"
B000002J2D|5.0|Steve hackett is finally gone and in my opinion held Phil, Tony, and mike back musically.  Mike rutherford had his hands full with all the guitar and bass parts in the studio.  I think that rutherford showed that he could cover the guitar role well.  Up until this album hackett did most of the lead guitar stuff.  mike had already established himself as a great bass player.  phil did a bit more writing on this one but mike and tony did most of it.  Down and out is a great opening and has one of the most difficult song structures I've ever heard.  i think it's in a 13/8 beat.  I love undertow and it's the first genesis song where you hear the trademark yamaha electric piano that genesis and phil collins used on the road and studio until the 90s.  i also love the cosmic keyboard songs on tyhe lady lies and the mood set on say it's alright joe.  This album shows just how strong Phil's voice and drumming are.  This is also the last genesis album with all acoustic drums.  This album's sound is very consistent and, once again, like every new genesis album, the sound has been entirely recreated. This was the 3rd phil collins era album and it is the strongest genesis album.  It also is a precursor to a world tour that got genesis into america and japan.  By this time genesis had established themselves as an intellectual band but then there was follow you, follow me that got the chicks interested.  This album and duke also produced the most emotionally and musically charged tours and performances in the genesis timeline.  1978-1980 is my favorite genesis period because it produced the two best produced albums in history.  this is a must for any genesis novice or hardcore fan.  Also good luck finding any live stuff on DVD and CD from this period.  It's out there but hard to find.  These guys are the most underated musicians in rock history.  So this really is the breakthrough genesis album musically and commercially.  Obviously, they got much bigger.  also this album's tour introduced daryl steurmer to the guitar line up.
B000002UAR|3.0|ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!  The proof is in.  People, many of them, will consider anything the Beatles have done to be a 'masterpiece'.  What are they actually hearing that I'm not on THIS one?  Yes, it's obvious Revolver is the precursor to the overhyped Sgt. Pepper but that does not mean it's a masterpiece or that it has many great, or even good songs on it. <br /> <br />I've always been a take it or leave it kind of guy when it comes to the Beatles but I will admit that Abbey Road is one the greatest and most innovative records in rock.  I also love John Lennon's solo work as well as his songs on the White Album.  However, his counterpart, Sir Paul, often sounds like he's attempting to write a children's nursery rhyme on many of his songs.  Apparently grown adults love nursery rhymes too. <br /> <br />The album kicks off fine enough with Taxman-a great george Harrison tune.  It then drifts into the surreal and haunting Eleanor Rigby.  This is an amazing song in production.  Not only is it melodically sound, but how many rock songs that you know of that lack drums, guitars and any other instrument aside from strings, sound this incredible?  In fact, it sounds so good I had to point out to a friend that the only instruments used in this song were strings and he had never noticed before.  That's a statement in itself. <br /> <br />I'm Only Sleeping and Love You To (the second Harrison composition) are mere filler. <br /> <br />Yellow Submarine-the most annoying song in rock? history.  This makes Kiss songs sound mature.  A nursery Rhyme and I've heard better.  If you like this, go get yourself a Wiggles video. <br /> <br />Side one closes with a Lennon song, She Said She Said.  It's a good album track, but nothing more.  Nice layered sound on the guitars.  At least side one ends on a high note. <br /> <br />Side two kicks off with a sterotypical McCartney song, Good Day Sunshine.  It's a bouncy, catchy song and a highlight on the album.  And Your Bird Can Sing is anothergreat album cut by Lennon. <br /> <br />For No One sounds like the inferior version of Yesterday.  Not nearly as good but not awful.  Pretty catchy but nothing to consider a 'masterpiece' either. <br /> <br />Doctor Robert is an ode to Lennon's drug dealer.  It's second rate Lennon.  Not as good as the previous mentioned songs by him on this release.  Filler! <br /> <br />I want To Tell You is Harrison's 3rd composition on the album and that's just too much.  He was a decent songwriter, but hardly prolific and 3 times within 12 songs is a little too much.  FILLER! <br /> <br />Got To Get You Into My Life.  GREAT song!  Great horns!  Great melody.  The epitome of the perfect pop song! <br /> <br />Tomorrow Never Knows is now what sounds like a dated attempt at psychedelia.  Must have been fascinating at the time but now it just sounds like, well, a dated attempt at psychedelia. <br /> <br />There you have it-4 top notch songs of single potential, surrounded by several album cuts and even more filler.  This album, as I see it, is a holding pattern-not as good as Rubber Soul before it and not as good as Sgt. Pepper after it and it contains songs reminisent of both. <br /> <br />Hardcore fans-BUY IT NOW! <br />Casual fans-PROCEED WITH CAUTION! <br />Beatle Haters-THERE'S A LOT HERE TO MAKE YOUR CASE!

B000002UB6|3.0|A HODGEPODGE OF MEDIOCRITY.  SOME GREAT SONGS SURROUNDED BY LEFTOVERS AND INCOMPLETE NOODLINGS (MORE OF THE LATTER THAN THE FORMER).  I KNOW, I KNOW PEOPLE WILL GIVE THE BEATLES 5 STAR REVIEWS IF THEY FARTED ON TAPE, BUT I'M NOT ONE OF THEM.  AN AVERAGE EFFORT.  GO GET ABBEY ROAD AND RUBBER SOUL.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This DVD has to get 5 Stars because of its historical importance. The Beatles can't do this. The Rolling Stones have no Brian Jones. The Beach Boys, enough said. I have read all the previous reviews and would like to make a comment.<br /><br />I saw Cream live in 1966 and 1968 and I also played in bands doing their stuff around New York in the 1960s. I met Jimi Hendrix in 1967 in the Village and he loved Cream. When I saw them in 1966 they did \\"I'm So Glad\\" and Clapton's solo included the 1812 Overture, but my ears hurt for a week! When I saw them in Phoenix in 1968, they opened with their biggest song \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" first-it just wasn't done! I thought it was great-the unexpected.<br /><br />This Concert IS the unexpected. These guys play an \\"New\\" version of themselves. I find it entertaining, enlightening and exactly what they should have done. The set includes some of everyone's favourites. You can't please everyone. Bruce explains that they couldn't do \\"I Feel Free\\" because it was a studio recording and so was \\"Strange Brew\\"-It had several guitar parts with the Albert King solo from \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\"! However, doing \\"Pressed Rat\\" for the first time live was a good idea. It think it is very telling that during \\"Crossroads\\" you see a very happy Brian May. So much for the critics! The new version is clean and cool. Also the wah-wah pedal is an effect that can disguise an average player. I think it was a good idea for Clapton not to use it and play clean on \\"White Room\\".<br /><br />The whole concert and outtakes are well presented. I don't look too much at the overall camera work, the sound is good. Many reviewers wanted Clapton and Bruce to go back in time with Marshall Stacks and so on, well you can't can you? They themselves said that. Why would you want to replicate the 1960's stuff anyway-do you need to? We have the CDs and the Farewell Concert! What another version? And Ginger's laid back drumming-I prefer it!!! He is a jazz drummer and he sounds better now. When I bought the Cream's records in the 1960's I always skipped \\"Toad\\" who wants to hear a 15 minute drum solo-On this DVD it's shorter, but it is too long for me!!! That is the only negative thing I have to say.<br /><br />Eric Clapton has done so much to promote the guitar and especially Blues guitar for 40 years I don't know why people are so keen to knock him. He moved on from the big sound of Gibsons after he heard the Band and Bob Dylan. He plays a replica of \\"Blackie\\" his most famous Strat. It was done by the Fender custom shop and is great to see after his last two flashy \\"Avant Garde\\" models. Perhaps his contract with Fender made him choose not to go back to Gibsons. However, it's a different sound and this is a different concert. He also uses  a Fender'57 Twin re-issue tube amp with a Leslie speaker cabinet, very cool. Jack Bruce shows a lot of skill on his fretless bass. He could could have used a 5 or 6 string bass.<br /><br />Clapton's playing is his usual melodic style. Comments have been made about he's old, bad tone, always plays the same old thing- well there is the pentatonic scale and it's how you use it. Albert King always got knocked about his same old riffs-but were they really the same? Buddy Guy always plays those \\"overbends\\" and decending pentatonic runs on the 5th and 4th chords, B.B. King plays that Major Pentatonic scale and so it goes. You like it or you don't.<br /><br />As far as the set list. \\"Badge\\" is great. Clapton did a great version of this on his Hyde Park Concert and this is a highlight and a tribute to George Harrison. \\"I'm So Glad\\" is a great beginning. It kicks the Blues end off. This song had it's royalties go to help keep Skip James (who had cancer) alive long enough to rerecord his original recordings! \\"Outside Women Blues\\" maybe should have had a little Albert King tribute solo from \\"Strange Brew\\", but it's great. \\"Stormy Monday\\" gives these guys a jam together with a classic number and, very interestingly, asa tribute to British Blues, they do the Chris Farlow (with Albert Lee) version, the UK's first Blues hit. \\"We're Going Wrong\\" probably the best performance on the DVD-probably because like \\"Double Crossing Time \\" (about Jack Bruce) on the Bluesbreakers LP it has been a forgotten classic! \\"Sitting On Top Of The World\\" is cool with Bruce playing harp (Dylan-style) and bass not like the record and on White Room they start by reversing the vocal parts. This is why this concert is so good.<br /><br />If you are into 1960s music, blues, are a current or ex-Cream fan, a fan of Clapton in general, you will like this DVD. I think it's great that one 1960s band reunited before I retire. Mayall sort of did this with Clapton and his 70th Birthday Concert, but it wasn't the original Bluesbreakers (and Clapton didn't use a Gibson there either). In an age when guitar playing has become judged like an Olympic event-fastest, loudest, most rigorous technique and so on-with multiple effects I would say to the critics: Let Eddie Van Halen, Steve Vai, and others sit in with Eric Clapton on his next Unplugged Acoustic session. He still sounds good without an amp!rlow (with Albert Lee) version, the UK's first Blues hit. \\"We're Going Wrong\\" probably the best performance on the DVD-probably because like \\"Double Crossing Time \\" (about Jack Bruce) on the Bluesbreakers LP it has been a forgotten classic! \\"Sitting On Top Of The World\\" is cool with Bruce playing harp (Dylan-style) and bass not like the record and on White Room they start by reversing the vocal parts.

B00001OH7O|5.0|Long before the world would reckon with the Spiders from Mars, this insightful gem teased and delighted the adventurous listener.  \\"Is there life on Mars\\" sums up a generation's searching; while \\"Oh You Pretty Things\\" announces to the world that a new generation has taken center stage (with all of its wonderful contradictions). <br /> <br />No song is a less than grand.  This is a five star affair from beginning to end.
1594200653|4.0|This book is likely to be the textbook for some years to come on Postwar European development. It has been most widely and favorably reviewed. Among the points of praise\\" Its excellent Eastern European country- by - country survey of the collapse of Communism. Its full presentation of the Marshall Plan in putting a devastated continent back on its feet. Its tracing of the European Union idea which has led to the present amalgam of four- hundred and fifty million European economic citizens, the greatest internal market in the world. Its presentation of the political rivalries within the Union, especially an excellent survey of British - French relations. The book has been faulted for claiming that the Soviet collapse came about for internal reasons primarily, and not because of Reagan-American Administration Star- Wars pressure.<br /><br />Anthony Gottlieb has suggested in the ' New York Times' that the book tends to somewhat downplay the clouds hanging over the European future i.e. the demographic dearth,the rapid aging of the population, the relatively high - unemployment.<br /><br />The work is a primarily positive look at present European development, especially the rapid growth and amalgamation of the past twenty years since the fall of the Soviet Empire.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|As great as this album is (read the other reviews), the song versions in this 2 cd set are the same (meaning taken from the same nights) as in the DVD.  Contrary to what the AMAZON editorial says, all of the exact performances on here are on the DVD, not alternate takes of the same songs, taken from different nights.  The lternate takes on the cd are repeated on the DVD, which has 2 more songs, thus a better buy.
B00008972S|5.0|The ironic thing is, this movie was trying to point out peace and discrimination issues, and being made in 1961, led to an era of peace and anti-discrimination battle cries. This movie is in retrospect, the best musical of all time. With its deep mysertious characters and chaotic plot, the movie keeps you gripping your seat til the dramatic conclusion. The Puerto-Rican sharks vs. the manhattan raised Jets take you once again back to the time of when gangs roamed the dirty side of the cities. the plot (William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' brought to a new time period and light) revolves around the characters of immigrated Puerto-Rican Maria, her sister Bernardo, his girlfriend Anita, Maria's given lover Chino, Her real lover Tony, who's best friends with Riff, who's the leader of the Jets. With a rumble following a community dance where Maria and Tony first meet, the leaders of the Sharks and the Jets, Bernardo and Riff, are knifed and killed. Overcome with emotion, Tony, who killed Bernardo after Bernardo killed Riff, wants to turn himself in, and finds himself unworthy of Maria's love. Chino has Bernardo's gun, and a bullet he intends to use on Tony. Maria can't see the hate, she wishes to love everyone and everything. But taking sides involves hate unfortunately, and love is stuck in the middle of it. The movie comes to an end with Tony being shot by Chino, and Maria finally gets the message out to everyone: Hate can cause so much sorrow, why do people even hate? The movie has many brilliant dance and song numbers, and a deep, revolving plot. The fast paced number America (\\"Things are all right in America! If you're a white in America!\\") brings latin spirit and is a simply amazing seaquence to the film. Winner of 11 Acadamy Awards, more than any musical has ever won, this movie clearly states all over it that it is a true classic.
B0000029GA|5.0|The then 20-year-old Muslim Nas would have never expected Illmatic to be added to the hall of fame of rap albums (this is not hip-hop by the way). I highly reccomend this album to people who are more familiar with the bling-bling commercial hip-hop to take a break for a minute and listen to this. Look how hungry rappers were back then. Look at the rhymes. Lyrics overpowered beats. Now look at people like Lil'Jon and Nelly who can't rap, make beats or write lyrics and are making millions.

U have 2 listen 2 this one really closely 2 appreciate it. i can imagine it on an NBA Live soundtrack) <br />06-MEMORY LANE *SITTING IN THE PARK*-4.5/5 (should hav been a storytelling track. pretty good though.) <br />07-ONE LOVE-4/5 (should hav been about his friends, enemies or fights he got into) <br />08-ONE TIME 4 YOUR MIND-5/5 (niiiiiiiiiiiiiiicccccccccccce!) <br />09-REPRESENT-5/5 (best beat on the album) <br />10-IT AIN'T HARD TO TELL-5/5 (good way 2 finish off the album) <br /> <br />In conclusion, proof that this album rox is that it was released in 1994 and is still creating a large buzz in 2005. This album just goes to show u that u don't really need big-ass beats for a good songjust like eminem did with Infinite, Common did with all his albums along with Zion-I. I hope i can find more rappers like nas in the future and less rappers like lil' romeo. rap is really at it's dying stage and needs someone to pick it up quick. The Game, D12, Ludacris and Common are currently doing the best job of it.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Its hard to beleive \\"Dookie\\" \\"Insomniac\\" were made by this band, in fact they were'nt. \\"Nimrod\\" and \\"Warning\\" were a bit, well they were godd enough albums.  <br />But \\"Good Riddance\\" destroyed the bands repespectable reputation as it became a mainstream pop hit and slowly its been down hill from their. Not entirely though. At least it was still reasonably good music at least. <br /> <br />This, this is not music! This is a commercially overhyped album, that sold well with singles and albums, cause kids who like pop music bought it. <br /> <br />Because thats what it is is, its flavour of the month nonsense <br />and because Green Day now seem to be more concerned with their image (make up, mascara,hair styles?!) and because they are more popular than ever, many would hope they are'nt fooled into thinking what they're doing is doing anything for music. <br /> <br />Unfortunatly that looks more than likely. <br />Billie Joe called this dangerous rocknroll? <br />What is it exactly thats dangerous about it? Because it has a title of a stereotyped \\"American Idiot\\"? <br />Because its about annoyance at politicalness or anger at war. <br /> <br />So whats that endangering? Nobodies opinion, thats what.
B00006G9QN|4.0|I picked this book up after watching an interview with the late author, and was impressed by his candor, his apparent honesty, and his astonishing thesis. <br /> <br />The book is an odd amalgam of what appears to be factual information, mixed with wild speculation, mixed with hard-boiled prose from a dime-store novel, mixed with numerous asides and diversions.  In all, whether it's true or not, it's a great science fiction story, like a Philip K. Dick alternative future tale (\\"The Man in the High Castle\\"), or an alternative history of the 20th Century.  I have no idea whether the central claim is correct, but it was a fascinating read anyway. <br /> <br />Mr. Birns, who apparently wrote the book with Mr. Corso, does bite off more than is necessary, however.  Many times he has Corso committed to certain positions when it is clear Corso has no first-hand knowledge, such as the details of the original 1947 crash itself.  Or his many asides on CIA spies for the Soviets, or knocks against the Kennedys, the use of nuclear missiles by the US to ward off aliens, or his fanciful alternative history of the Gary Powers U2 crisis. <br /> <br />In all, if you take it all with a grain of salt it's a quick and enjoyable read.  I believe Corso would have been well-served wuth a better writer helping him, and a better editor limiting the many opinions expressed in this book to the one central claim over which Corso does seem to have first-hand knowledge:  that there were alien technologies recovered in Roswell that were then farmed out to government contractors, who reverse engineered these technologies for application by the US military.
B0006399FS|1.0|The talk about this album before it was released was quite extrodinary considering what this album actually turned out to be. <br /> <br />What was it announced as? <br />It was announced as \\"A return to the early U2 updated\\" <br />                    \\"There best album yet\\" <br />                    \\"I've heard it, its their best album yet\\" <br />                    and so on.... <br /> <br />There are two different types of people in this world, people who love music with a passion and enthusiasm, and those that listen to chart hits, or whatevers in the charts or pop music. <br />Pop music is actually just a song, its not music. Although its called music. <br /> <br />U2 fans are, or were people who loved U2s music with a passion, and excitement. Its not about reinventing the wheel with every album. U2 did'nt purposley set out to reinevent themselves with Zooporopa or Actung Baby, or even Pop.  <br /> <br />They sounded different on those albums because they were musicians, who had a passion for making music, music is a natural progression and alternating thing. Thats whats so exciting about it, you don't know whats going to happen next. <br /> <br />Theres no plan, no rules, no theory, music comes from another place. Ask any songwriters and they'll tell you that, they don't write the song, something else does, but they have the passion for music and to write, and thats what makes music so amazing. <br /> <br />Thats why you get so many bands that are flavour of month and then they get forgotten about, because they are careerists not people who love music. <br /> <br />\\"How to dismantle an atomic bomb\\" is hugely dissapoiting. To think fans waited for 4 years for this is quite horrendous. <br />\\"All that you can't eave behind\\" was lacking because it followed the same trend as this album. <br />It did'nt seem to be about the music so much anymore, it was about writing songs, like they were so well known for. \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" \\"Angel of Harlem\\". <br /> <br />Unfortunatly, you can't repeat your self as an artist, those songs were a natural progression in the bands search to make music, that has its place and time, but you should not manufacture that, because it will just be a pale retread. <br />eg. How does \\"Beautifull Day\\" stand up against \\"Desire\\"? <br />    How does \\"Walk On\\" up against \\"Bad\\"? <br />    <br />If you enjoy music, and not just a typical song you'll realise the difference, thats if you really enjoy music. Theres many that don't care, and thats fine. But we need music! <br /> <br />Who knows what U2 could be doing now if they stuck with what comes naturally to them and did'nt try and take the wheel and steer of what they should be. <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|In time, music lovers will look back at American Idiot as one of the classic rock albums of all time. It'll be in a class with The Wall, Hotel California & Born In The USA. There's no doubt comparisons will be drawn with other Rock Operas such as Tommy, Jesus Christ Superstar & Quadrophenia. In all likelyhood Green Day has assured their spot in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with American Idiot. Blvd. of Broken Dreams one day will be mentioned in the same breath with other classic songs such as Layla, Who Are You & Life In The Fast Lane. If you like Rock music on any kind of level & don't own this CD my only question to you would be: What are you waiting for?
B000059Z8M|5.0|TOY STORY 2 is one of those sequels that is just as good as the movie that spawned it.  With even more brilliant Pixar animation and the return of all the main characters from the first, with some additional new ones, TOY STORY 2 is a delightful tale of toys and humans and the bond that exists in spite of the fact that one day the humans will grow up and abandon their toys.  Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar and all the other great actors who voiced the characters bring life to these delightful toys and the animation once again is superlative.  A wonderful film for the entire family to enjoy.
B00005JGAB|4.0|If you like The Ramones tracks on this album, you should check out Screeching Weasel's album \\"Kill the Musicians\\".  They do some rad covers of the Ramones including Chain Saw, Sniff Some Glue, Havana Affair, etc.   <br /> <br />Screeching Weasel, The Queers, and Green Day (well, early pre-Dookie Green day) developed their sound in part due to the genius of the Ramones. <br /> <br />Lookout Records has some good bands if you like this sound.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|I apologize, I found the xtras!!!  Great DVD!    BTW Leonard Maltin - Johnny Horton san NORTH TO ALASKA, and Gene Pitney sand THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALENS.      Yes, this is the real one.  CinemaScope, surround sound, etc.  It is GREAT.    BUT, the box lists a bunch of extras that are not there:    The Corset: Don't Leave Home without one?  Photo gallery?  Original trailer?    All missing.  We do have commentary about the movie, but not what one would expect.  Not much commentary about the scenes as we move along, but mostly commentary on how movies have changed over the years.      And, yes, as a previous reviewer commented, you cannot get rid of Leonard Maltin, eventhough the menu says you can.  After hearing it once, that is enough!    But all these aside, it sure is nice to see this finally come out after being promised for many years.  TV always shows the pan and scan version, but in Europe I saw it in wide screen on TV, wonderful!

B0007Y08QA|5.0|All I can say is EXCELLENT! This movie is reminiscent of the movies of the late 1940's or early 50's. In true Hitchcock style. Trevor Reznick, played by Christian Bale, plays an American Machinist, where the film is intended to take place in LA. (Which is actually filmed in Spain.) A definate Film Noir. Special care was made in making this film as a classically beautiful one. Even though the story line is just the opposite in story and some horrific scenes. The music score was marvelous. The cinematography was superb! This movie reminds me deeply of the movie \\"Jacobs Ladder\\". Things that are real, are really not real and so forth. Yet, they are all real in Trevors mind. This is definately a psychological thriller! I cannot wait to watch it a few more times. Peace DJ Todd
B000B8IA2G|5.0|After having discovered that an ancient race of advanced humans are the builders not only of the Stargate Network on the Milky Galaxy but also of the city of Atlantis, a team of international experts embarks a one way journey to the Pegasus Galaxy (without the possibility to return home until they find an energy source) where the Ancient City is submerged under the water. <br /> <br />Stranded in an unknown galaxy and without enough power to restore Atlantis to its full glory, the new team must face a new powerful enemy called the Wraith (who managed to defeat the ancients not because of superior technology, but due to superior numbers and unending persistence), who are vampire like bug humanoids that practically drain life from their victims.  <br /> <br />As the series unfolds, the team is in a desperate quest to find as much as they can about the city, the ancients, a power source to feed Atlantis called ZPM (three of these zero-point-modules are needed and they have none) and above all, to protect not only Atlantis from an imminent siege from the Wraith, but also to prevent them from ever finding Earth's location (or they will \\"feast\\" of all human life in the Milky Way galaxy). <br /> <br />The story develops nicely, and the mythology of the series grows this season each episode, building the hype for the second season with a cliffhanger.  <br /> <br />Some prefer Stargate SG-1 over Atlantis, but considering that SG-1 has had 8 years to evolve into what it has become, Atlantis is getting there quite fast. The concept of exploring the city of the ancients in a new galaxy has tremendous potential, more enemies besides the Wraith are introduced (Genni) or hinted (the ones who created the devastating virus of the episode Hot Zone are promising).  <br /> <br />Overall, this is the start of another great series. Highly recommended.
B000067DNC|3.0|This season is mostly an experimentation phase and they also start the backbone story line for the Asguard, as well as a new pain in the neck, the Tok'Ra. All-in-all for a SG fan its a good season just because its SG-1. If you're not a fan than you can do without seeing.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This is an incredible album.  Takk... is so orchestrated and beautiful, with soaring, majestic, uplifting, epic songs.  All these tunes are deliberately and artistically crafted, composed and performed with special attention to mood.  Songs advance from one phase to another with captivating grace; the album is simply a wonder to hear.  Sigur Ros takes the time to develop its musical landscape, exploring themes amply and weaving a shimmering melodic tapestry.  If you like blends of instrumental and vocal, electric guitars and strings, the earthly and the divine, then this album is for you - Takk... is nothing short of spellbinding.

B00005JKG7|3.0|It's been a long time since I've seen this movie, so I won't comment on it too specifically, but I feel I've gotta say something now that it's being discussed a bit more.  Simply put, this movie is passable, and certainly not one of Carpenter's better efforts.  In their eternal rage over the recent popularity of the remake, some people like to imagine that whatever original is a classic.  This one isn't.  It wants to be atmospheric, but it's mostly just uneventful, and endless shots of fog banks aren't especially fascinating, and the bland characters yakking it up aren't terribly remarkable either.  The ghost-sailor-zombies are pretty neat, but they don't actually do all that much that we get to see.  I don't remember much of anything about the characters at this point, so they must not have been very fascinating, though I do recall being irritated by Jamie Lee Curtis, as per usual.  Again, this film is passably interesting, but Carpenter just can't quite generate enough  atmosphere to make up  for the fact that nothing is actually going on.  And though the fog looks pretty nice most of the time, the cinematography is generally pretty bland.  (There is one major exception in the form of an excellent shot of a number of ghosts standing in the church, but that's about it.)  And, the opening attack on the ship at the beginning is pretty well done, nicely transferring Carpenter's slasher skills to a new genre.  But, the film is a whole is just kinda blah.  Not quite boring, but far from engrossing, and it has a fairly anti-climactic ending.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie is a perfect candidate for  remake.  Good concept, passable execution.  Course, the remake is pretty lousy, but it didn't have to be.  If they'd hired some talented people to write and direct it, it probably coulda been pretty good.  Though I find it utterly hilarious that people are whining about how this  material will 'watered down' for the remake. Hah!  This movie isn't gory at all, as in it doesn't have ANY gore in it.  We see a few blades and hooks poke at a shirt.  That's about it.  The remake is actually substantially more graphic than the original, and there is no way in hell that this version would be rated R is it had been released this year. (Well, I won't go quite that far.  The MPAA might give anything any rating at any time, but they'd have to be far more confused than usual to place an R on this again.)  Apparently some people failed to notice that modern rating standards are a helluva lot more lax than they used to be.  Hell, 'The Fog' was less graphic than some PG movies even at the time.  'Jaws', for example, is far more graphic than this, and that came out like 7 years before this.  I think they use the, ahem, f-word like once in this movie, which may well be the real reason for the R.<br /><br />Most people are gonna tell you, 'Don't see that crappy remake, see this amazing, innovative original!!!'  Well, I dunno if you really need to see either of them, particularly if you're not a huge horror fan.  Just go watch 'The Thing' again, or perhaps check out Carpenter's underappreciated 'In the Mouth of Madness'.  If you're a non-discriminating horror junkie like me, you might as well see them both.  It's actually a kinda interesting case study, as the original is a too low-key, whereas the remake is way overdone, particularly at the end. (Where it becomes quite comically over the top.)  Though, you definitely shouldn't see the remake until you've seen the original.  It just isn't proper, and it is the better of the two, if not by all that much..  But yeah, whatever, I've already talked about these films more than they deserve.<br /><br />Grade: CY gore in it.  We see a few blades and hooks poke at a shirt.  That's about it.

B0009UC7H0|3.0|I read Mr. Cussler's book several years ago and thought it was pretty good for a Dirk Pitt story. This movie isn't a whole lot like it, I'd heard Cussler was suing the producers over it and I can see why on viewing \\"Sahara\\". If you haven't read the book there's a lot of action and interesting scenery, the plot isn't so bad- sort of James Bond with more humor.   If, however, you have read the book be prepared to see something that only touches upon what Cussler wrote because it is a very liberal adaptation. Lot's of bits have been dropped, other's rewritten or rearranged- it's no wonder Cussler got upset.   The movie is a fun way to spend an afternoon but if you've got to have it the way the book was, go get the paperback here at Amazon and save yourself some money. The movie isn't bad at all, it just is not what the book was. It is much better than \\"Raise the Titanic\\" was.
0316172324|3.0|This is a subject of great interest to me:  what kind of thought goes on that we are not \\"conscious\\" of.  What powerful, parallel algorithms are executed by the brain, but outside of the step-by-step process we call rational thought.  The anecodotes are great and give a real feeling for the wonders of the mind, but Gladwell's analysis seems a little sketchy.  The fundamental criticism is that the experts he discusses have spent years learning their unconscious skills.  Gladwell is obviously aware of the theory of learning, how sequential thought eventually gets turned into pattern-matching parallel systems in the brain, but the tone of the work is more \\"magical\\".  This makes for fun writing, but leaves you feeling a little disappointed.  I would really rank this as 3.5 stars...it is better than average, but there are lots of 4 star books out there one could read instead.
B00005JNTX|2.0|Any filmmaker that dares to try an adaptation of a comic book faces many problems. In order to put page to screen within a tidy two hour package, it is absolutely necessary to change elements of the comic that will get even casual fans up in arms.  Also, comic books overwhelmingly tend to feature characters and events that defy reality, making special effects take front and center over the characters that are often the main appeal in the first place. <br /> <br />Director/Editor/Writer/Composer Robert Rodriguez has managed to circumvent some of those problems while taking others head on. Sin City is based on a black and white comic book series that very few people in the audience would even recognize. Rodriguez left the Director's Guild of America to bring artist and writer Frank Miller on as co-director to duplicate the comic panel by panel. In the process he effectively sidesteps any criticism from hard-core fans. Going in the opposite direction for effects, Rodriguez takes a story that could be done with very few special effects and no computer imagery at all and completely soaks each and every black and white frame with as much technical wizardry as he can. Shot entirely with digital cameras and using very few sets, it is clear Rodriguez had a ball making the picture, but as all students of film know, making a good movie is about as fun as a root canal with no painkillers. <br /> <br />The plot itself consists of three interweaving tales dipped in incredibly gruesome violence, rolled in hard-boiled noir, and sprinkled with macho male fantasy. Indeed, the three heroes soak up bullets like a tank and don't die, and every woman in the movie is either a stripper, a prostitute, or just plain naked. The first and by far most interesting tale is that of Mickey Rourke's Marv, a hulking brute of a man who relentlessly kills his way across the computer generated Basin City to avenge the death of a prostitute. Next up is Clive Owen butchering an American accent as Dwight,one of those people who doesn't seem to have a specific role in society but who still manages to get himself and an entire town full of prostitutes into grave danger. Ending the miniature trilogy is Bruce Willis as John Hartigan, a cop with a bad heart(literally) that protects a girl from a repulsive but powerful pedophile. Aside from Rourke, the star-studded cast is generally calm and unmemorable. Most surprising of all is the normally reliable Willis, who speaks his lines as if he has a sore throat and is reading them from a note card held up by a production assistant. <br /> <br />In adapting Frank Miller's excellent work to screen, Rodriguez brought everything but the kitchen sink and the soul. Style and effects is the name of the game here, with the story itself a very distant third. Despite the ferociousness of the violence, it fails to make an impact as the film never ratchets the emotional intensity of the characters to anything above a whisper. When Willis' character struggles through a heart attack to save a young girl, he seems more like he has a bad case of diarrhea than a serious heart condition. Noir style dialogue that lights up the comic book falls completely flat when said with the painful lack of flair demonstrated by the majority of the cast. The strict adherence to the frames of the comic is a fatal flaw. The lack of versatility in the shots leads to awkward moments that resemble the type of cartoon the film needs to avoid. A subtle but deeply damaging aspect is the music, which attempts to be noir but sounds like it was composed a few hours before prints were to be shipped out to theaters. <br /> <br />It is interesting that both Rodriguez and Sin City are so frequently compared to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Rodriguez and Tarantino are good friends, and Tarantino even \\"guest directed\\" a short segment of Sin City. As I watched that segment, I longingly thought of Tarantino's films, celebrations of all that is film and pop culture, bringingthe best elements of both together. Sin City definitely has similarities with Pulp Fiction, but where Sin City lacks a serious consideration for the thoughts and feelings of its characters, Pulp Fiction revels in any and everything to do with the people on screen. Watching anything by Tarantino gives you the awe-inspiring sense of watching a master at the top of his game, while Sin City just makes you sadly shake your head at a big kid playing with his digital toys. <br />
B000002JSR|3.0|Fittingly a tribute to both John Bonham and a final bow for a great band, 'Coda' was released in November 1982 to \\"clean out the vaults\\" so to speak. For a record buying public hungry for new material, this compilation didn't disappoint although half of the eight songs are mediocre at best, but a few classics are found here. Jimmy Page commented at the time that this was all that was left but how could he forget \\"Hey Hey What Can I Do\\" and \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\"? (maybe he didn't being the savvy business man he is, why not wait eight years and drop a box set!) Highlights include two cuts from the Royal Albert Hall: \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" (blows away version from album 1!!), the former a set opener at the time. Blistering!! Two other standouts, \\"Poor Tom\\" (an obvious Zep III leftover) and \\"Wearing and Tearing\\". For many who thought Zeppelin would have sailed a less heavy course if Bonzo hadn't downed his 40 vodkas in 1980, \\"W and T\\" is kickass hard rock, recorded in Sweden in 1978, same sessions as 'In Through the Out Door'. The band fired on all cylinders here, too bad no more was to be heard. 'Coda' is for Zeppelin completists only but is a brief snapshot of what made this band so great. Medication indeed!

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Batman Begins is by far the best Bat-film ever. For this film to be as great as it was,was absolutely necessary.The Batman took a hard punch in the face with the Batman and Robin film and ruined the series. The Tim Burton films and Batman Forever were good movies, but flawed.Good, but not great.With those films,we never got a real sense of who Batman was or really why he chose to do this. And they also had a very surreal world theme to them. Batman Begins answers all the questions,has a real world feeling and fantastic performances.This is the Batman movie I have been waiting for! I enjoyed this more than I did Spiderman 2(A Great Movie!). Batman Begins finally got it right!!

0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men was written by John Steinbeck. It took place in the early 20th century. This story starts off with two characters near a stream. There names are Lennie and George. Lennie is slightly retarded and George is his long time care taker slash best friend. These two friends have a dream of owning there own farm one day. But first they had to make money, so they left on a small journey to find a job. They had a couple of jobs but Lennie couldn't control himself during the jobs so they got fired. They finally found a job at a farm. Lennie got into a fight. But they got to keep their jobs. Lennie messed up again, and accidentally killed Curley's Wife. Lennie ran back to the stream. The other farmers gathered and went to kill Lennie. George got a gun and killed Lennie before the farmers did.  But Lennie was happy when he died because he was thinking of their dream farm. <br />For the most part of this book I like it. It was a good story. I liked the conflicts. I felt bad for Lennie, because he's really a genital giant and it's not his fault that he freaks out when people scream. He also couldn't control himself and I felt bad for him because of that. Some thing I didn't like about this book was it said Jesus Christ a lot and that offends me. But other than that the book was easy to read and it was short...that's the way I like it.  I liked the tone that the book was written in, old country slang. I like how the author wrote. I do recommend this book if you ever want to read a short and easy book. And overall it was a good book. <br />

B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is how Batman is supposed to be.  Batman does not arrive in a 4th-of-July-esque hailstorm of flashing lights.  He appears, attacks, and vanishes.  There should NEVER be a glowing blue bat-mobile.  There should NEVER EVER be nippples on the bat suit.  That is an atrocity.  Possibly a war crime. <br /> <br />The earlier films lined up four men too small to be the Dark Knight, and ended up making the films about the villains, not the hero.  Batman Begins embraces the darkness spun around the myth of Batman in the decades of comics.  Batman isn't cute.  Batman punches hard.  Bale buries himself in the role, and is the best Caped Crusader to ever play the role. <br /> <br />With Bale, Holmes, and an incredible allstar supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldham) who combine for 3 Oscars & another 8 nominations, this is easily the Best Batman film to date, and possibly the best comic book film ever.  Sorry Spidey.
B0009F9O6M|5.0|Several years ago on this site, I wrote a review of another album by this band and titled it \\"Band in need of a reissue series!\\"  Well, EMI/Virgin must have been listening because my prayers have been answered.  H to He is the first one I've picked up and based on the excellent quality I will absolutely be getting more.  Peter Hammill himself handled the spiffy remaster, in consultation with his former bandmates, all of whom were involved in the production of this series.  There is a 16-page book with lyrics, photos, credits and liner notes, and best of all two bonus tracks, a studio run-through of \\"The Emperor in his War Room\\" recorded 6 months before the album version, and the legendary \\"Squid/Octopus\\" recorded live in the studio.<br /><br />VDGG were a progressive rock group of the highest order, featuring keyboardist Hugh Banton, drummer Guy Evans, woodwind virtuoso David Jackson and the inimitable Hammill on vocals, guitar and piano.  Outgoing bassist Nic Potter appears on about half of the record, with Banton filling in on bass pedals for the rest.  H to He Who Am The Only One was their second proper record and remains a great album to this day.  As much as I love The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other, I think this one is the superior record.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Killer,\\" is the all-time prog classic here and sounds amazing in remastered form.  VDGG were one of a number of early prog groups on the Chrysalis label, along with bands like Lindisfarne and Genesis, that suffered from murky production that sounds dated to modern ears.  The detailed, cleaned-up sound here is revelatory and a real godsend for fans.  The melodic piano ballad \\"House With No Door\\" is also here, featuring Jackson's wonderful flute work.  Sometime VDGG collaborator Robert Fripp turns up to lend some electric guitar bite to \\"The Emperor in His War Room.\\"  \\"Lost\\" and \\"Pioneers Over C\\" are two excellent prog epics, with the latter going completely over the top a la \\"After The Flood\\" on the previous record.<br /><br />But I'm saving the best for last!  \\"Squid/Octopus\\" is a 15 minute jam filled to bursting with everything a prog fanatic could dream of and more.  This is the only surviving track from an aborted live in the studio album intended to be part of Pawn Hearts before Chrysalis torpedoed the double-album idea.  This is an absolutely killer prog epic of the highest order, unbelievably brought to light after all these years.  Words really fail me except to say that it is reason enough to buy this CD.<br /><br />I am now salivating over getting some more of the VDGG reissues in this series, but for now it is one outstanding addition to my prog collection and I highly recommend it to progheads.e Flood\\" on the previous record. <br /> <br />But I'm saving the best for last!  \\"Squid/Octopus\\" is a 15 minute jam filled to bursting with everything a prog fanatic could dream of and more.

B000929AJQ|1.0|I've loved every halo, single, soundtrack song etc that NIN has put out over the years. This on the other hand. No. I cannot force myself to digest this. All I can say is better luck next time. Basically Trent pulled a St. Anger on us. Yes I use that to describe really bad things these days. That should give you some idea of how bad I think this album is.  <br /> <br />  An artist cannot always produce terrific albums every time, but this could have been better. Much better. The hype was so great but the music is so mediocre. I say buy something else that you don't already have from NIN. Like Still or Things Falling Apart. That way you can bypass the waves of dissapointment.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|Over all just a little bit too slick for my liking. Without a doubt it was great to see them play again, but if I had a say in the matter they would have used the same amps, guitars, and basses from the old days. (I know Jack says they tried that approach in rehearsals but \\"didn't like it\\") I found Jack's  hi tech bass rig sounded too clean, and was under mixed. I thought the drums sounded fabulous as did Ginger's drumming. That brings me to Eric, sigh...would it have killed him to strap on a Gibson for some of these songs? The Strat sounded good on stuff like \\"Badge\\", and a couple of others, but \\"Crossroads\\"?... c'mon! That's like playing \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" on a banjo. I have to echo what others have said here about song selection on the DVD, No \\"Tales of Brave Ulyses\\", but we get \\"Stormy Monday\\"...that ain't right!  Oh, and \\"White Room\\": Eric, the wah wah is that long skinny black pedal on the floor beside the Leslie switch.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the greatest concert video ever created.  I was only a casual Talking Heads fan, that is until I saw this movie and it destroyed by brain.  I couldn't believe how incredible this DVD is. <br /> <br />Quickly, without giving away too much:  The concert starts with David Byrne and a boombox with a cassette of a drum beat.  He strums his acoustic guitar with the tape to \\"Psycho Killer\\" (It takes balls to open with your best known song).  Eventually, the other members come out to play along, one at a time, gradually building the set and musicians in the same way that a movie is built.  ONce the entire band is onstage, the set picks up with the more complex Talking Heads catalog, and all of the songs are FLAWLESS. <br /> <br />Another great thing, is that you never see the audience until the  last minute and a half or so.  This was done on purpose so that the viewer never feels like the movie is telling him/her that he/she should enjoy it becuase the audience is.  You get the band and the songs, and that is more than enough. <br /> <br />Aside from the great commentary, there are some fun extras, such as David Byrne interviewing himself as different characters.  Just right the right amount of bizarre!
B000002LE6|5.0|'Lovesexy' holds a special place in my heart because it feels like a hootenanny, Paisley Park style. Yes, it's sloppy but it's so damn fun, so straight up funny (Google the lyrics to 'Lovesexy'...hilarious!) and so damn warm that I can't help but feel the love. 'Lovesexy' captures that Sly Stone vibe without trying too too hard...it's light and summery but with a gospel levity that harkens back to Robert Johnson, refers to Aretha, and looks forward to Outkast and all their craziness.  'Lovesexy' boasts some seriously awe-inspiring B-Sides:  'Scarlet Pussy' is  just plain demented in the best way possible.
B00018D44U|3.0|I don't understand why this CD is rated 'Enhanced' rather than 'Content Protected'.  I cannot play it in my computer, and I cannot transfer songs from it to my phone.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|Hey kids. Remember when this awesome band came out after the fall of a mediocre songwriter (name started with a K, hmmmm) and released an awesome self titled and terrific follow up album then plummeted into musical mediocrity. Well they're back and this time they actually brought some music with them to share with us. <br />To make it even better the music actually sounds like they spent time writing it. Wow. Isn't that great. I think they learned they're lesson and have returned to apologize through good music. <br />I say Foo give yourselves a pat on the back for a job well done.

6305127697|4.0|I'm surprised there hasn't been a review to suggest what I think is the REAL mental condition of Edward Norton's character. Its called antisocial personality disorder, well known for a lack of remorse or regret on the part of a perpetrator of a crime (i.e. Scott Peterson, Ted Bundy, etc.). Responsible for the crime? Yes. But I'm still surprised the possibility of this diagnosis has not been brought up (since multiple personality disorder was brought up in the movie). I gave the movie four stars because I think the movie industry has a fantastic duty to go beyond just the making of a movie for financial gain, and use their influence to educate. There are many movies that have \\"special features\\" devoted to educating the public about issues. I think this could have been one of those movies.

Not to mention the vocalist,\\"no I will not refer to him as a singer\\", sounds like a dying brain damaged horse. Well it certainly doesn't help.  <br /> <br />I feel bad giving them one star because I don't want them to feel like I got anything  out of their \\"music\\", because frankly that would be lying. <br /> <br />Oh and for anyone who doesn't want to read my entire opinion and wants a summary in layman's terms. This CD sucks.
B0000033P2|5.0|Finally got around to replacing this old vinyl!!  This was one of the very first \\"albums\\" I ever bought, and loved it-It got me hooked on classical and rock music all at once!  So, when I heard it again for the first time in many years--I was once again in high school!!! Neat use of the 'Moog' synthesizer-which was cutting edge back then, and incorporates classical themes in rock!!
B0002858YS|4.0|Why oh why didnt I pay attention to the hot fuss about the Killers last year when their praises were being sung? I heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" for the first time ever a few days ago and I was floored. Memories of being young, in love, brave, free, fast and furious flooded me -- it was like discovering New Order all over again! Even though the Killers rock alot harder than New Order, the influence is undeniable. I agree that there is also alot of the Cure and Joy Division mixed in with their style. Honestly, \\"Hot Fuss\\" is so refreshing in the mess of everything that is supposed to be rock and roll these days. The highlights for me are \\"Brightside,\\" \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" and \\"Believe Me Natalie.\\" This album is fast paced and positively energetic. If you are a generation x-er still in love with 80's New Wave music, this is a MUST to add to your collection.

B000007R1E|5.0|This album was the last of the classic 7 from the Moody Blues from the period from 1967 to 1972. It was also, like the 6 preceding it, different from the others. \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is the most middle-of-the-road rock album of the bunch; very little progressive rock, no real experimentation, just plain solid rock.<br /><br />The Moody Blues had become better and better at orchestrating their style of music throughout the six classic years period. By the time they reached this album, they were fully mature in a rock style all their own, and yet fitting with the times.  Looking back, it is difficult to see how they went from \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" to this album. EGBDF was progressive rock with a fair amount of fantasy and science fiction. Seventh Sojourn is very down to earth, reflecting a more mundane and earthly orientation.<br /><br />The synthesizer is a fully matured instrument in \\"Seventh Sojourn.\\" In the Moodies previous albums the mellotron was used for novelty and to enhance the unusual nature of their albums. In \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" the Chamberlain replaced the mellotron and became part of the orchestration. The use of the Chamberlain is sometimes so subtle that I find it difficult to know when the Chamberlain is used.<br /><br />With all these differences, the change to a more earthly orientation, a middle-of-the-road rock sound, and a new instrument, you might worry that the album was so different that it is no longer true to the group. Not correct in this case. When you listen to the classic 7 in order from \\"Days of Future Passed\\" to \\"Seventh Sojourn,\\" there is a feel of evolution, and perhaps, a feel of balance. Sometimes I become sad when I listen to this album because I know the group would never be the same group again. However, as we all know, the group has continued to evolve while trying hard to stay true to their roots. The results continually amaze me.<br /><br />Of the classic 7, this album is the least cohesive in terms of a common theme, and yet there are themes. As noted earlier, the principal theme is the orientation back in the world as we know it. No dreams, no people from other planets helping us; merely a recognition that this is the place and time in which we live, and darn, while we wish it would be better, it's us that has to make it better, and we can only do so much. What more of a theme do you need?<br /><br />This album is excellent. The themes are excellent. The Moody Blues came back to earth and said: We aren't magic; we have to focus on the real world; we are just a rock and roll group, we are as lost as you are. These thoughts were sobering for those people that somehow thought the Moodies were gurus for a new world order. They were not and did not want to be. \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is a reality check.<br /><br />Given all the positive comments about the album, which should be one of the best 100 rock albums of all time (and is not, according to those narrow-minded people at VH1), it does have one flaw: It is too short! There are only 8 wonderful songs; two each from Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and John Lodge, one from Ray Thomas (\\"For My Lady,\\" my favorite Ray Thomas song from any album), and one that was a collaboration between Graeme Edge and Justin Hayward.<br /><br />\\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is the most polished of the classic 7, and would rank as one of the best Moody Blues albums by some people. Of course, other people did not care for the melancholia and mundane topics and got all bummed out and gave it a bad review, which just goes to show, you can't please everyone all the time. I read one reviewer who hated \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" and loved \\"Seventh Sojourn.\\" Another reviewer described EGBDF as being original and true to the group while \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" was too much pop and not the Moody Blues' best work. Who do you believe? Listen for yourself. When I'm in the right mood, this album is awesome. Other times I need something uplifting, and I listen to another group completely.<br /><br />All good groups generate controversy. The Moody Blues are no exception (which by definition should make them a good group). They have always defined their own path in a unique way. \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" closed the first chapter in the story of The Moody Blues. Enjoy it for what it was and what it is: a good album by a good group.<br /><br />One final warning; this version of the album requires a DTS decoder, so it you do not have a DTS decoder you may wish to seek out one of the other versions.group completely. <br /> <br />All good groups generate controversy.

0525948023|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has a brilliant writing style that transcends the egoic mind to bring humanity into a state of pure inner peace, as well as into a heightened state of Self that we all came into this life to live. This state obliterates the shackles of ego that vacillate between chaos and confusion based on what our egos are clinging on to while it embraces our life purpose. Anyone with an open mind and heart will benefit greatly from the wisdom Eckhart has written for meaningful personal transformation.<br /><br />The text flows beautifully, and deeply, just as in all of his books, this book especially hits home and make a lasting difference.<br /><br />It's an extraordinary contribution to humanity and for all who wish to evolve into their highest Self.

B00028U6B8|4.0|Yes, well, that revolution may not have succeded, but Volunteers as an album certainly holds its own with the preceding Airplane albums. It is highly underrated because its political stance so overshadows the rest of the album. In fact, only two or three songs really take a \\"radical\\" political stance.    Sure, \\"We Can Be Together\\" has lines like \\"We are all outlaws in the eyes of America.\\" Whether or not that still has relevance is for conservatives and liberals to battle out, but the music is among Jefferson's best, the opening riff is dynamic, and the band certainly sound engaged throughout this classic. If the political statement is a little dated, it's very hard to deny the passionate delivery - Jefferson Airplane believed that music could change the world.    Realizing that the guitar riff was classic, Marty Balin and Paul Kantner reused it for \\"Volunteers,\\" a brief but effective rocker whose catchphrase - \\"Got a revolution!\\" - remains the most political statement on Volunteers. One of the greatest Airplane songs of all time, it was rather ridiculously used in an ad for something - jeans, if I'm not mistaken. Well, I guess jeans have something to do with revolutions. Maybe...    Between those two counter-culture anthems lie a number of songs that hearken back to their less political days (the wonderful \\"Hey Fredrick,\\" the straightforward classic \\"Turn My Life Down\\"). Others emphasize a pastoral, rural theme (\\"The Farm,\\" \\"A Song for All Seasons\\"), and Jorma Kaukonen and Paul Kantner each contribute an adaption (\\"Good Shepherd,\\" a coffeehouse staple, and \\"Meadowlands,\\" the Soviet army's theme, respectively). The band also cut their own version of \\"Wooden Ships,\\" arguably better than CSN's version (admittedly a classic), and \\"Eskimo Blue Day,\\" a somewhat disjointed song that (maybe) touches on environmentalism, in Grace Slick's own obscure way. But it's a very good song. Actually, the latter's lyrics mostly sound like a description of an acid trip.    Volunteers was met with heavy criticism upon its release, and many have said it's the worst Balin-era album, but it's every bit as good as Crown of Creation. They are both strong, solid efforts from a band at the top of their game.
B000059HB7|4.0|I remember watching with my own father and I commented about how the bad guys in this film just happened to have a rope on them just when they needed it! I was only 15 when I caught that. The music numbers are good (Get along home Cindy Cindy) but if it is exciting western action you want this is pretty slow, watered down and restrained stuff. Dickinson does shine in her not-wasted role as another plus.
B00006HBBL|5.0|Many rock groups have been described as \\"progressive\\" during various times in their careers. To truly understand the definition of progressive rock, put yourself in 1968 listening to this album for the first time. The Moody Blues surpassed the Beatles with exquisitely complex orchestrations, using instruments that often were (and are) played only in obscure classical presentations.<br /><br />This album was a follow up to the ground-breaking \\"Days of Future Passed\\" album, and set the expectations for all future Moody Blues albums.  Many groups get into a groove and keep playing that groove endlessly and monotonously. The Moody Blues made seven concept albums in a row, none of which was identical. Most were only similar in that they had elements of fantasy, science fiction, and hope for a better world and a better life. The expectations for each Moody Blues album was (and continues to be): what unusual thing are they going to try to do this time?<br /><br />In this album they played with using instruments to achieve various effects, such as the doors opening on the \\"House of Four Doors\\", and the combination of instruments on \\"Om.\\" The use of the sitar on the song \\"Om\\" is one of the best in a rock album.<br /><br />This album ranks as one of my all time favorites. There is no need to evaluate individual songs because they are all very good. This album deserves to be ranked with albums such as \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and Led Zeppelin's Runes or ZOSO album.  In some ways you may consider this album as a peak for the Moody Blues; reviewers frequently compare their subsequent albums to \\"Days\\" and to \\"The Lost Chord.\\" Fortunately the Moodies have never been disheartened by the unexpected success of their first two albums, and have kept on making more music.<br /><br />If you are new to the Moody Blues, you will find this album to be one of their best. However, you will find that even an \\"average\\" Moody Blues album is better than the \\"best\\" of many other groups. Typical criticism of a Moody Blues album comes from comparison to other Moody Blues albums, because it is difficult to compare the Moodies to other groups.  If you like this album, you may also enjoy \\"To All Our Children's Children's Children,\\" \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" and \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.\\" Each of these is similarly experimental, with varying degrees of success.<br /><br />Regardless of your feelings toward this album, it helped defined progressive rock as a genre with the few other progressive rock groups of the late 60s and early 70s, and will always hold a special place for those who looked forward as rock evolved beyond the Beatles.<br /><br />A final caution regarding this particular version; this version is the \\"Japanese\\" release, and there are less expensive variations available.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Words can't describe how incredibly fantastic is this DVD. Quality is quality... the music is timeless. Generations before have, and generations to come will still be enjoying these songs. Every song and performance is top class. You feel you are right there in the concert. The audio and camera work supurb. There is just no end to describing how good is this. <br /> <br />The only thing is that with my favourite song \\"Hotel California\\" I would have preferred to have had the guitor part played without the horns. There is just something about that guitor part that you just want to hear raw (if you know what I mean). Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it and so did the crowd. As I say \\"a good song is a good song\\". Still 5 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />This is a collector's item... a Must Have. Filled with all their best songs and also their latest. Do not hesitate. Go buy this DVD. I assure you, you won't be sorry. It will be one of your favourites now and still in years to come.

The settings are absolutely fascinating, and this is the most tasteful treatment of necromancy that I've ever seen.  The writing is lyrical, the characters are striking, and the story itself is the sort that will cause you to be preoccupied at work.<br /><br />Clearly, I think Sabriel is pretty wonderful. The next two books wrap up the story, but I maintain that Sabriel is the best of the lot.

B000002J03|4.0|This is the best Zep album, especially if you are a guitar freak who just wants to hear Jimmy Page wail! <br /> <br />Whole Lotta Love - This song has a really bad chorus, but that ends soon.  They go into some weird sounds and vocals until a really great solo kicks in from Jimmy. <br /> <br />What is and What Should Never Be - This is an awesome roller-coaster of a song.  The verses go from slow to fast and quiet to loud.  Anotehr great solo does the same. <br /> <br />Lemon Song - A cool song that has some great licks from ma man Page.  It's really awesome, you gotta hear it. <br /> <br />Thank You - A terrible song, I wont lie. <br /> <br />Heartbreaker - The best Zep song in the world!  Forget stairway.  Heartbreaker has an awesome riff and a solo that'll make you want to explode in your pants! <br /> <br />Living Lovin Maid - A perfect follow up to Heartbreaker.  It's a really groovy throwback tune. <br /> <br />Ramble On - It's an OK song, but you gotta love the reference to The Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br />Moby Dick - I'm not a drummer, so I can't really comment on this one.  The guitar part is good, though! <br /> <br />Bring it on Home - An awesome song that starts off kinda funny with Plant sounded retarded (litterally).  But in the middle it has one of the best guitar riffs that is really fun and easy to play. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a MUST HAVE for guitar lovers.
0780020685|5.0|`The Seven Samurai', written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, is easily one of the top ten movies of all time, along with such greats as Fellini's `La Dolce Vita', Renoir's `The Rules of the Game', Eisenstein's `Alexander Nevsky' and `The Battleship Potemkin', Welles' `Citizen Kane', and Michael Curtiz' `Casablanca'. Just by being Kurosawa's best picture is distinction enough, since Kurosawa has done so many great titles. Even in Japan, it is considered both the very best `Samurai' movie and one of the very best movies of all time.<br /><br />One thing which makes this stand apart from those other greats is that it is a pure action / adventure movie, a genre which rarely gets mentioned in the same breath as `Casablanca' or `Citizen Kane'. Even such great action works as `Raiders of the Lost Ark' are usually discussed only in comparison to other action movies. I must say that its substantial length helps, as many great movies are longer than average. And, the greatness of the film is enhanced by the fact that the director maintains a constant pace of action over the full three hours and twenty minutes.<br /><br />This movie is also the greatest achievement of the collaboration between Kurosawa and the actor, Toshiro Mifume, a cinematic pairing comparable or even greater than DeNiro and Scorsese, Mastroianni and Fellini, and Keaton and Allen.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, with all this time, there is very little dwelling on the personalities of the major characters. If fact, one almost finds more details about the mercenaries' and bandits' motivations in the great American western adapted from this film, `The Magnificent Seven', starring Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen. Unlike the American western, Kurosawa's original really deals primarily with the problems and motivations of the farmers who hire the mercenary samurai. The plight of the farmers is even reflected in the history behind Mifume's character who is a Samurai wannabe who steals a family history in which to place himself to give legitimacy to his `warrior' inheritance, when he is actually the orphan of a farming family killed by roaming bandits, exactly like those who threaten the farmers at the center of the story.<br /><br />The story was faithfully copied in `The Magnificent Seven', so if you know that movie, you know the story of `The Seven Samurai', with two big differences. In the original, the farmers recruit the seven ronin (samurai without a master) by enlisting the aid of one especially astute samurai, Kambei, who is dogged by a young amateur who wishes to apprentice to the master. Kambei recruits four other expert fighters and leaves for the farming village with his five colleagues, shadowed by ersatz samurai Kikuchiya (Mifume's character). (Horst Bucholtz' character in the American movie is a combination of the characters of the apprentice and Mifume's character).<br /><br />The samurai and the villagers directed by Kambei, construct defenses for the village after the barley harvest and the samurai train the villagers in basic tactics using bamboo spears. Here, we discover the farmers' dirty little secret in that they have a cache of samurai weapons and armor lifted from samurai passing through and down on their luck. This is added to their other distrust of the samurai being around their daughters and wives, who have a bad habit of falling for the highly capable fighters.<br /><br />The last third of the movie is taken by the battle between the band of forty bandits and the villagers and their samurai allies. Unlike Eli Wallach in American Western, we never get to meet and talk to the bandit chieftain. All we adduce from their behavior is that they are even more tired and hungry than the farmers, which is why they continue to press the attack even when they are whittled down to only thirteen fighters.<br /><br />This Criterion Collection edition of the film has one of the most valuable extras for any film, let alone a foreign film dealing with a distant time and place. This is a running commentary by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck, similar to the excellent commentary to Renoir's `The Rules of the Game'.<br /><br />One of the most remarkable things about `The Seven Samurai' is how subtle are the clever filming and editing by Kurosawa and his team. When you watch `Citizen Kane' and Sergei Eisenstein's films, it is obvious that the filmmaker is doing something special with lots of shots. `The Rules of the Game' is a bit subtler, but you can see it there too. The only thing which stands out in `...Samurai' is the superb use of body language and business in conveying things about the characters. Mifume alone seems like a parody of what he is trying to be. Every action is exaggerated, almost to the point of absurdity.<br /><br />I have seen several of Kurosawa's samurai movies such as `Yohimbo', `Throne of Blood' (Japanese version of `Macbeth'), and `Rashoman', but `The Seven Samurai' is head and shoulders above even these notable movies. I have probably seen it at least half a dozen times and I always find new things to admire about it, expecially with the excellent commentary track to bring out new things about which to marvel.a distant time and place.

B00005JO0J|4.0|I saw the film Serenity a couple of weeks ago. Based upon the short-lived TV series Firefly, the film is a science fiction actioner...fast-paced, with twists, and with a sense of humour.<br /><br />The cast of the TV show re-united for the film. It's a likeable, solid cast--all no-name character actors, which emphasizes the ensemble feel.<br /><br />While the film spends a few minutes introducing the \\"Firefly universe\\" at the start, for the most part the characters are introduced on the fly. The setting: some 500 years from now, Earth has been abandoned, with humanity setting out into the universe to re-settle, and a military conflict has recently concluded with the outcome of uniting all the settled worlds under a rather intrusive central government. The intro allows folks not familiar with the series to come up to speed pretty quickly.<br /><br />As for the story, it would appear to be the intended end of the series' first season. For those not in the know, the \\"Serenity\\" is the ship populated by most of the main characters, who are a band of smugglers and thieves who descended into this lifestyle following being on the losing side in the aforementioned military conflict, with a few stragglers (read: fugitives) picked up along the way. One of these fugitives is a character by the name of River, a psychic who has learned some nasty truths about the central government's actions in the past few years, and the government would rather she were dead, than walking about with those secrets. It is the discovery and unfurling of those secrets that is at the heart of the plot.<br /><br />It's an entertaining story. The characters, despite being on the bad side of the law, are flawed but good at heart, and they care for each other like family.<br /><br />All in all, it makes for an enjoyable film.<br /><br />It is a film with violence, and death, but older kids should be able to handle this quite well.
0345349571|4.0|My copy of \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is aptly illustrated with the ominous vision of the pale horsemen leading the legions of the dead against men.  The men of the picture are an army themselves, caught while besieging a city.  One of the unfortunates, on spotting the column of cadavers raises his arms in surprise, though he could just as easily be rebuffing death itself - \\"we're busy now - can you try back, like during the Renaissance?\\"  In fact the pages of \\"Mirror\\" are so redolent with death and suffering - owing largely to ceaseless and purposeless wars, plague and other unfortunate events, one wonders how death itself was able to keep pace with mankind.   <br /> <br />\\"Mirror\\" charts the bloody ebb and flow of the calamitous 14th century in Europe.  With the crusades over, and the renaissance yet to begin, 14th century Europe saw endless fighting - most of it between England and France.  The combatants tear at each other for land and for ransoms, but are inspired by a sense of chivalry - which means that the combatants were better at romanticizing wars than fighting them.  While ennobling the institution of Knighthood, knights themselves were prone to freebooting, sack & pillage and other acts that darkened the word \\"medieval\\" but were miserable failures at actually winning their battles.  The \\"Hundred Years War\\" bookends the story, but historian Barbara Tuchman focuses the story on Enguerrand VII, Sire De Coucy - an uncommonly wise noble atypically free of much of the avarice of his class.  Coucy is seldom much of a director of the events of the age, but his peculiar strength of character provides a valuable frame of reference for Tuchman's often incisive survey of the \\"Calamitous 14th Century\\".  When the nobles aren't fighting their futile wars, marauding soldiers rove the countryside of France, Italy and the German states selling their services (or buying \\"protection\\" from those services) from nearby towns.  When the soldiers aren't busy enough, the plague picks upthe slack, decimating whole populations.  The nobles, endlessly hungry for revenue to fuel their wars, increase the tax burden on the survivors.  Religious fervor underlies much of the conflict, but also fails to make a dent on the course of events - that is until the great schism of the Roman church.  With a pope and cardinals reigning in each of the cities of Rome and Avignon, the Papacy is fatally divided.  Coucy aside, the principal actors in this sorry tale are the successive French and English Kings, and the bellicose nobles on either side - Lancaster, D'Anjou, Berry, Burgundy to name a few.   <br /> <br />The fatal flaw of the age isn't simply being medieval - with all of primitive connotations our conceited era has condescended to attach to it.  Rather a lack of genuine nationalism, makes it impossible to end what we now call the Hundred Years War.  Lacking the cohesion of national identity, combatants have no critical reason with which to favor one side or another, and end up plotting against each of the other sides.  Instead, each side fights for prospective sovereigns - either English or French contenders for the throne of France.  Neither is there the stability of the modern nation state.  Ironically, the stability would come in the next century with the rise of Charles VII, ill-famed as the effete weakling in Shakespeare's \\"Henry V\\" and the legend of Joan of Arc.  But until then, Europe suffers the hubris of the age of chivalry, of ignoble wars, the Black Death and papal schism.  European rulers stir themselves to martial pursuits with the intention of uniting against \\"The Grand Turk\\" but spend more time fighting against each other.  Tuchman closes her tragic survey with the battle of Nicopolis, when the pretensions of European chivalry - with its love of silks, guilt armor and traveling pavilions - are crushed by determined Turk foot soldiers. <br /> <br />For all the dry boredom one could associate with medieval European history, Tuchman makes for 500+ pages of unstoppable reading.  Tuchman's talent for sentence structure and word usage, her understanding of social dynamics and a superhuman capacity to avoid condescension makes \\"A Distant Mirror\\" a book that sticks in your mind, at times becoming - dare I say it - a book I couldn't put down.  I was first introduced to Barbara Tuchman through her unforgettable \\"March of Folly\\" which, to this book, is merely a primer.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Last summer's runaway indie comedy smash ($400,000 budget, $40 million gross to date), Napoleon Dynamite, won't make everyone laugh. OK, maybe most people won't laugh, but this is a film with a fiercely loyal cult following (count how many Vote For Pedro shirts you see on your campus) that will appeal to former teen outcasts, nerds and Aspies (OK, so maybe the Aspie bit is redundant). Napoleon is a geeky high schooler/prodigal Aspie who wears snow boots in summer, draws Pegasus and unicorns in his Trapper Keeper, and lives with his very butch grandmother, a finicky llama named Tina, and Kip, his nerdy older brother who \\"chats online with babes all day\\" and is training to be a cage fighter (yeah, right).<br /><br />Napoleon's school life consists of getting beat up by the resident jocks, and his home life isn't much better. (\\"How was school?\\" his grandmother asks Napoleon. \\"The worst day of my life, what do you think?\\").  He soon meets Deb, a geeky, painfully shy neighbor who is earning money for college by producing glamour shots in her basement and selling those funky boondoggle keychains (I am SO a child of the `80s!), and Pedro, a Mexican fresh across the border, who answers everything in a syllable or less, wears holy medals, and has santo candles ringing his bathtub.<br /><br />The movie is filled with out-there moments: after Napoleon's grandma breaks her tailbone on the sand dunes (don't even ask!), his obnoxious Uncle Rico (which means \\"rich\\" in Spanish, appropriate because Rico is full of failed get-rich-quick schemes) comes to stay. Rico and Napoleon engage in heated battle, including flinging steaks and grapefruit at each other from moving vehicles, testing a time machine they bought online (which produces groinal electrocution), and Kip finally meets his Internet chat room honey LaFawnduh in the ample flesh (I thought, after a prolonged setup, that....well, never mind, put the pieces together for yourself. Hint: it involves Kip's comment about never seeing a full bodyshot of LaFawnduh before they meet).<br /><br />Napoleon now has a gang of loyal geek outcasts, and the trio try to make their way through another horrible school year, including the prom and class elections. This leads to the film's funniest scene involving Napoleon, an awesome Jamiroquai song (Canned Heat), and D-Kwon's Dance Grooves. Actually, I found this film to be hysterical, being a) a child of the `80s and b) an incorrigible social outcast in high school. Warning: if you are one of the people who enjoys this kind of humor, be careful not to inhale your popcorn and choke during the many funny scenes that creep up unawares.seeing a full bodyshot of LaFawnduh before they meet). <br /> <br />Napoleon now has a gang of loyal geek outcasts, and the trio try to make their way through another horrible school year, including the prom and class elections.

0790729350|4.0|The Woodstock Music and Art Festival was the culmination of the cultural and sociological undercurrent of the turbulent and radical 60's. Held on a farm in upstate New York on Aug. 15-17, 1969, the festival was a gathering of what is said to be half a million people with most of the prominent musicians of the time performing. The Dionysian entertainment was the foremost announcement of the \\"Love and Peace\\" generation of their severance from the past and their inevitable return to it.<br /><br />The DVD edition of the famous event begins with noticeably substandard sound but is effaced by the sterling performances of the most memorable acts. Many of these artists began their claim to fame in the concert: highlights include Richie Havens' intense folk strumming starting the show; Santana's well-paced performance of their Rock Afro-Cuban instrumental classic \\"Soul Sacrifice\\"; Joan Baez's soaring \\"Joe Hill\\"; the frenzied Pop Music hybrid of Sly & the Family Stone; Joe Cocker's writhing Rock n' Soul version of \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\"; one of the best rendition's by The Who of one of their best and most popular songs, \\"See Me, Feel Me\\"; Janis Joplin's impressive and gut-wrenching Blues-belting; Crosby, Stills & Nash harmonizing on their acoustic masterpiece, \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\"; Guitar Paganini Alvin Lee leading his group Ten Years After into a revved-up \\"I'm Going Home\\"; and last but not least, Jimi Hendrix's version of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". The choices and selections in this transfer are not perfect though: Jefferson Airplane's spirited version of \\"Volunteers\\" should have been picked over the two dull Blues based tracks shown. Grateful Dead's performance should have been featured, even at least one song, regardless of the group's protestations. Interspersed with these are features of the festival offstage with Hippies smoking their preferred substance, Yoga classes, skinny-dipping, playing in the mud, and interviews with performers, promoters, audience members, and residents surprised but generally appreciative of the masses of \\"Freaks\\" who have come to visit.<br /><br />Many people in the present who lived through those times and those who didn't but wished they did glorify the era with the hindsight and distance of time, coating it with sentimental nostalgia. I could imagine how memorable the decade was: with it's defining innovations and groundbreaking events it's impact and influence are benchmarks in world history. But the reality of the moment can clearly be seen in the film. In no way does one get the feel of being in a momentous life-changing event - observing the audience one can see that people went there just to watch a gig. This revealing truth is the crux and heart of \\"Woodstock\\": the 60's counterculture movement revealed to a highly conservative America and hence the world the importance of  cultivating the mind and spirit, and the essence of social interaction which is the manna of man. Unconsciously, these same people showed the importance of a balanced structure of life and society which they ironically tried to destroy and detach themselves from. The drug casualties, the splintering of the movement, and the eventual inclusion of the tribe in their middle-ages into the corporate world quite embarrasingly disclosed this. That this was already known even at the festival, considered the peak of the movement, is shown at the film when a young hippie is interviewed together with his \\"free love\\" partner. I was impressed that someone as young as he was could be level-headed and mature enough to know the actuality of the times he lived in, to distance himself, considering that he was a part of it. He relates eloquently, to this effect: \\"Why would half a million people come here? Is it just for the music? I don't think so. They're here because theire looking for something, lost and misguided people searching for something to put meaning into their lives.\\" Though one can notice with a pang of nostalgia that people looked quite more mature and deep back then.<br /><br />Despite it's flaws, \\"Woodtsock - 3 Days of Peace & Music\\" is an essential and revealing experience, a time capsule on a moment in history that ushered change, with all the good and compromise that come along with it.oked quite more mature and deep back then.

6304696515|5.0|Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) and Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich) are the lead characters in this movie. Both of them were determined to get what they want, revenge for the Marquise, and glory and notoriety for the Vicomte. And together they orchestrated an arrangement that would destroy the virtuous and innocent Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the nave Cecile (Uma Thurman). The plan went off track when one of them fell in love with the prey and what follows was a power struggle between the Marquise and the Vicomte that would lead to everyone's destruction.       Glenn Close gave a marvelous performance in a role she's so adept at playing. She had that \\"period appropriate\\" spunk and edge that made you believe that she's some sort of society goddess. When she finally got what she deserved in the end of the movie, she magnificently conveyed a person crushed by defeat. And is it just me or is her fate more tragic than the fates of the Vicomte and Madame de Tourveil combined? John Malkovich, the chameleon himself, matched Close every step of the way. His arrogant and assured characterization of the Vicomte was very effective, physically he may not be the most attractive man but he made you believe that he was THE MAN of that time.    Pfeiffer gave a touching and devastating performance. She perfectly captured the different stages of the character's development from the harmless, righteous woman to her struggles to the advances of the Vicomte and eventually of her own feelings, to finally surrendering and allowing herself be part of that \\"dangerous liaison\\" and finally to being heartbroken of how that liaison concluded. Her best scene was when she was subtly but visibly fighting her own emotions as she was clearly falling for the Vicomte. The guilt, self restrain, and the helpless and inevitable surrender she conveyed in that scene was an acting ahowcase for her. You believe that it was \\"beyond her control\\".    The number of times this story has beentold in movies as well as in other mediums (novel and theater) somehow shows how fascinating the story is. The main structure of the story was brilliantly put into the screen. It's engaging, elegant, and very interesting. The different character intersections with each other through out the movie were nicely done as they used each other to act out their lust, revenge, deceit, and manipulation. The three major characters were all fully realized characters. All of the three's last scene (which happen to be not with each other) provide memorable and powerful closures with Close's character appropriately getting the very last scene as her societal reign was tragically put into an end.    Grade: A-
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First off, I will tell you that I am not just writing this review because I am a diehard fan of Final Fantasy. I have yet to play a single FF game, and the thought of spending 60 hours of my life on FF7 does not sound appealing right now. <br /> <br />I saw this at a friend's. I was immediately hypnotized by the gorgeous graphics. The movements, the textures, everything was beautiful. The fight scenes remind me of The Matrix crossed with some Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. You can really tell the bodies were originally real actors by the fluidity of the movements, which really adds to the effect. I can't emphasize enough how great everything graphically was. <br /> <br />Vocally, they could not have chosen better voices, in my opinion. I am really picky when it comes to voice acting, and I think it was as close to perfect as I have seen. Even though I only understood about half of what was being said, I could listen to the voices without even watching the movie. Just... Wow.  <br /> <br />Also, as you have probably realized, Nobuo Uematsu is a great musician. He completely blew me away with the soundtrack to this movie. Other than the male-vocal songs (like the end credits), the music is perfect. I would seriously avoid listening to the end credits though... I really was not a fan of his voice, but that's the only real problem I had with the whole movie. <br /> <br />Plot wise, I'm a little sketchy on because I'm not fluent in Japanese... But from what I can tell, it seems pretty good. Needless to say, it's mostly fighting (but it's based on a video game, so that should be somewhat expected), but the dialogue and plot seem pretty intense. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend buying this. I just pre-ordered it, and I can't wait until I get it. This movie is perfect eyecandy, even if you aren't a fan. This is one of the few movies I would probably force anyone to watch.

B00000JCOV|5.0|And again. It's me. Writing another review. <br /> <br />742617000027 - 0/5 - Pointless honestly. All it shows is Craig's sampling skills. Which are good but we're talking about the song, not the person. <br /> <br />(sic) - 4/5 - The only thing I have to say about this song is (sic). <br /> <br />Eyeless - 4/5 - Interesting chorus. Particularly interesting due to the fact that some homeless guy said it. Goes to show that the most random things make good songs. I'm not saying take this approach when writing songs, it worked for this song. I like the middle where it slowed down slightly with Corey's screeching. <br /> <br />Wait & Bleed - 5/5 - Great lyrics. Amazing vocals. Corey never seems to dissapoint me with his voice. It's either growling out vulgarities to prove a point or pumping out heart-felt emotions in the form of the voice of an angel. <br /> <br />Spit It Out - 5/5 - I like the rap/growl type dealie he does. It's very suiting for this song. The song has a great riff and the beginning with the growls is just awesome. The end of this song also leaves you wanting to listen to it over and over again. <br /> <br />Tattered & Torn - 3/5 - I liked the MFKR version so much better. Even though Corey's vocals are so much hotter than Anders' are. Anywho. On with the show... <br /> <br />Frail Limb Nursery - 5/5 - If you don't understand why I jsut gave this sample dealie a 5, read on. It comes right before the song Purity, and it just adds on to the sickness behind the whole Purity story and why Corey wrote about it. Which leads me to the next song... <br /> <br />Purity - 5/5 - Heart-felt lyrics with a dollop of Slipknot. It's a really sad story. If you read up on it and then listen to this song, you'll feel more emotional towards it. <br /> <br />Liberate - 5/5 - Overall great song. Even though the beginning kind of sounds like he says \\"Liberate my bananas...\\" I laughed so hard when I heard this so for the first time. But it's a good song overall anyways.  Goodlisten. Guarantee you won't waste your time. <br /> <br />Prosthetics- 3/5 - Corey's lyrics never fail to amaze me. Same goes for this song's lyrics. But the instrumental parts are just a pain to listen to. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but it's still not a masterpiece. <br /> <br />No Life - 5/5 - I love the lyrics to this song. Good everything. There's no other way to explain it. <br /> <br />Diluted - 4/5 - Sad lyrics in a way but the song isn't all that great. Not much more to say about it... <br /> <br />Only One - 5/5 - Way better than the MFKR version. Thank god they redid this with Corey on vocals. Love the lyrics (as always). Great song. Listen to it. <br /> <br />Scissors - 10/5 - This song is so sad and amazing I can't even explain it. It's just so amazing. I love it. <br /> <br />Average rating is 4.2 and I'm going to round it up to 5 because I really like this CD and somewhere along my rant of vocals and guitars, I probably messed up on a rating. But this definately deserves a 5.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|A mix of metalcore and punk which is def a new trend that has evolved from melodic/death metal. I would say these guys are one of the best hybrid bands if you were to mix 80's and 90's metal with a dash of punk. Best avenged sevenfold album to date!!! I was kinda dissapointed from the change of sound in \\"City of Evil\\". I guess they are leaning more toward punk nowadays. This album is more toward my taste in metal and the first few tracks just blows you away. Best picks would def be \\"Unholy Confessions\\", \\"Chapter Four\\", and \\"Clairvoyant Disease\\". Enjoy! <br /> <br />~puNk
0553382179|5.0|This book is fantastic.  I am a two week old flybaby and while that seems early to proclaim my life changed, I usually experience burnout in my personal improvement projects on week one.<br /><br />This book asks the reader a lot of common sense questions and forces examination of all aspects of your life.  For example,  Why do you buy and collect stuff and clog up your house and life with it?  The book goes on to answer with a \\"here's what to do intstead.\\"  It gives the overwhelmed homekeeper (or figurehead as I was) a starting place and do-able recommendations, putting a positive spin on what was my own personal idea of Hell.  I am no longer slaving away for nothing.  I am blessing myself and my home and most importantly, my husband.  And my recently blessed environment has given us such peace in the last two weeks that I want to continue to bless it!  I actually look forward to coming home and working on my zones, hotspots, and new habits.  I feel like this book has forced a healthy assessment of my thinking and has given me information to spin my whining into a proactive and productive lifestyle.  Are you in a rut and feeling bad all the time?  Check out this book and Flylady's website.  I promise if you are ready for change this will help you!

But that's where it ends, Muse are amazing, listening to there music one has to wonder how 3 boys from Devon can make so much fantastic noise!!<br /><br />I had been wanting to buy \\"Origin Of Symetry\\" after hearing some of the tracks for a while and was eventually pursuaded by a friend and huge Muse fan. Glad i did, after buying that i bought \\"Showbiz\\" and \\"Hullabaloo\\" and then \\"Absolution\\" when it was released! Not being there best album it is still very good! It has to be said Matt Bellamy, lead singer, is a god! he plays guitar and piano with the skill of a prodidgy and has the voice of a classicaly trained singer.<br /><br />If there is one thing that i can say about Muse then it would be that they are a welcome alternative to some of todays crap and very under rated.<br /><br />Do not call them Radiohead, Muse have talent and can play there instruments, can Radiohead?
B000002LND|5.0|Released in 1990 this album basically summed up Madonna's career to that date, since then she has become more controversial and successfull. But most people miss the Madonna of days gone by, the 80's. The Immaculate Collection shows off Madonna's talents and voice well and highlight her huge impact on the music industry during that period. Her biggest hits, Like A Virgin, Holiday and Like A Prayer are included as well as two new tracks, Justify My Love and Rescue Me. This album is very enjoyable because it shows firstly the development of her music and the progression of her voice. All the songs here are good with the exception of Justify My Love which I find rather bad.<br /><br />1. Holiday 10/10<br /><br />2. Lucky Star 10/10<br /><br />3. Borderline 10/10<br /><br />4.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The best scifi I've seen! Joss Whedon's use of humor is is perfect. The best writing anywhere. He develops every character slowly and carefully, giving you a little bits and peaces over the whole series. By the end you begin to know and feel for these rebels fighting the lost cause. I loved this series. I want more. Everyone I know who has watched this series love it. I give firefly my top recommendation.
B000002UCN|4.0|Love the voice, the music, but unfortunately not all the songs are great.  I usually get 2-3 good songs from a CD and that was it for me.
0393324818|5.0|Nice book. Easy to read and some swell stories in here. Not just about Billy Beane and the Oakland A's, also about Bill James and plenty of others. Good book.<br /><br />Only complaint is the rather poor copy editing job. At one point, the book says the A's are \\"looking for more Barry Zito's.\\" Looking for more OF Barry's Zito's somethings? Looking for more Barry Zitoes? Zitos? Sheesh. I don't know. Just some goofy things like that in here that are like that little piece of napkin on the edge of your glass when you're drinking some really good scotch. Not a deal-breaker, but kind of a pain nonetheless.
0694013889|3.0|I think it gives kids the general idea, but it really didn't hold either of my girls' interest. My 3 year old trained at 2 1/2 and I don't think the book helped her at all. My 2 year old is just getting ready to train and she really has no interest in the book. I was thinking about finding something a little more appealing to help her out. I think I'd keep looking.....
B000002KIE|5.0|Ok ok, so really if you don't already own this than your 1 of 3 things 1.really really young and just getting into good music 2. a greenday/good charlotte fan and this is too \\"punk rock\\" for you or 3. a complete idot. Theirs a reason this album is mentioned so much people,cause every damn song on it is a brooding storming punk classic. The Pistols proved with this album that its not how fast you play (all these songs are pretty much mid-tempo) but the actual content of your songs! If anyone asays the Pistols were dirty punks that couldnt play or write than their DEAD WRONG! Aside from Anarchy and God Save the Queen if you can't sing me at least half the lyrics to Bodies or No Feelings than I don't wanna' talk to you!  <br />p.s. Sid Vicious is not on this album!!! Glenn Matlock barely is! So thank Jones,Cook and Rotten for a lovely time.
B00005JNJT|5.0|The DVD:<br /><br />You have a choice here, if you want to buy the DVD for the latest Batman movie.  You can buy the wide or full screen versions, which should be reasonably priced, and contain this fine film and not much more in the way of special features.<br /><br />Or, you can spend more, and get the two-disc deluxe version, which has no less than 7 documentaries, a 72-page comic book and is for true Batman fans or those who really appreciate seeing just how much the format can offer.<br /><br />Your choice!<br /><br />The Movie:<br /><br />Batman Begins, this summer's entry into the Batman film legacy, redefines the series. Director Christopher Nolan, who has already captivated me with his takes on \\"Memento\\" and the Al Pacino vehicle, \\"Insomnia\\" finds the story and the star to tell it. It's a dark piece, and owes far less to the comic book than the Tim Burton versions. All of the action and adventure is tied to the psyche of the man who becomes the dark hero. I don't think Nolan worried about that, because it is obvious that the fan base and the money men wanted a return of the harrowing aspects of the Dark Knight, following the successes in bringing the Marvel comics to the screen, and wanted the cartoon (Jim Carrey, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Batgirl and Poison Ivy) parts gone.<br /><br />To get there, Nolan relied on storylines and backdrops from the excellent graphic novels that have grown up around the Batman legend, then paired with David Goyer to write the screenplay. The result is that this film is far and away the best of the five, and edges out the third film in the Star Wars trilogy for the best big screen adventure movie of the year, so far.<br /><br />Christian Bale plays a stripped-down, emotionally unavailable Batman, and his character is thoroughly outlined.  You know exactly what his demons are, and you go through the decision-making process he takes with Alfred (the outstanding Michael Caine) to build the Batcave, and find the identity of the hero who will finally make criminals feel his presence.<br /><br />The origin of Batman's training, the ninja backdrop, and the presence of his fearful mentor, Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson, better as a Ninja than a Jedi), open the film, and we see Bruce Wayne traversing through some of the most dangerous spots on the globe, in Asia, to meet the fearsome Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, on the screen for too short a time). Ghul is fighting against crime as well, but has chosen Gotham City, Bruce's former home, as his battlefield. His League of Shadows wants to destroy the city, and the crime with it. Wayne cannot go along with the plan, and his escape from the Tibetan stronghold is perilous and destructive.<br /><br />Wayne's return to Gotham City introduces those he aligns himself with; Assistant DA Rachel Dawes, a childhood friend (Katie Holmes), Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman, a scientist at the Wayne foundation whose work has been buried by the big business aspirations of Empire Wayne and the head of the company, Mr. Earle (Rutger Hauer digs himself out of B movies for a guest shot), a youngish police inspector, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman in a great cameo), and of course, the stylish presence of Alfred.<br /><br />The villains here in Gotham, the Scarecrow and mobster Carmen Falcone are less interesting than Ducard and his men, but, in the end, they nearly succeed in their own destruction of the city. Cillian Murphy was cast as the Dr./Scarecrow, but I found his onscreen resemblance to Lara Flynn Boyle, albeit decked out as a guy, too distracting. Tom Wilkinson played Falcone with some over-the-top flair.<br /><br />The actual battle scenes are tense and inspiring, the Batmobile is undoubtedly a star of the movie all on its own. Camera shots and cinematography are second to none in this production, and all of it carries out Wayne's/Batman's message....<br /><br />\\"I went around the world, searched in all the shadows. And there is something out there in the darkness, something terrifying, something that will not stop until it gets revenge... Me.\\"n the darkness, something terrifying, something that will not stop until it gets revenge... Me.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00070Q8DQ|3.0|The band's name says it all. This album is one nasty mamma jamma, for sure. The triggered / replaced drums are laughable though.
B00005JNZP|5.0|I didn't read the book, so I'm not reviewing this film with the same perspective as many of the other reviewers. That said, I really enjoyed Everything is Illuminated. I'm a big fan of Russian language films and this one didn't disappoint (granted, it's not a purely Russian/Ukranian film).  <br /> <br />What this film does is convey the importance of connectedness and remembrance. It's important to remember those who've gone before us, and it's important to want to be remembered when we go. It's a great part of our humanity, and this <br />film 'illuminates' this tenet perfectly.  <br /> <br />There are two wonderful performances by elderly actors, Boris Leskin and Laryssa Lauret. There is so much beauty in aging and in the wisdom and pain that is accumulated within. These two actors portray all of this perfectly: their eyes speak volumes, their smiles probe deeply. Supporting actor and actress nods would be well-deserved, but because this is a limited-release film, it is highly unlikely that this will occur.  <br /> <br />The film starts out as a comedy, but ends solemnly with much to reflect on. Highly recommended.
B00005JNTX|5.0|as a film noir (crime fiction featuring hard-boiled cynical characters and bleak sleazy settings), excellent
B00005JNTX|5.0|Visually, it's perfect. Every shot could easily be transferred into a frame of a comic book. It's mostly in black and white but it's beautiful nonetheless. The use of shadows and light is amazing. Each of the stories I found interesting but it did take a little while to develop an interest in each one of them. I think the movie ran a little long but, still, I really enjoyed it. It made me want to read the comic. I hope there's a Sin City 2.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I loved this movie I thought the actors had so much chemistry, it may just be them walking and talking, but its a story about life, love and so much more.  I think ethan and julie had done a supurb job in this movie, I don't think too many people could of pulled it off.  It definitely make's you think about getting older, and your first love, or even maybe someone you lost once. It tells alot of what is really inside people, its a movie you can really relate too..Everytime I watch it, I come away with so much more, it's inspiring and most of all insightful.
0316172324|5.0|Heard an interview with Malcolm Gladwell, the author of BLINK, on NPR earlier this year. It was just after I had to make a critical spot decision in seconds... then wondered for hours whether it had been the right thing to do. As it turned out weeks later, it was the correct decision to make, and in those weeks I had taken the opportunity to read this book, an impromptu personal gift from someone very close.<br /><br />Had I read the book before, I would have felt more confident in my ability to make an intuitive snap decision that was right.<br /><br />We all have to make quick decisions in our daily lives, some mundane and some critical. We make quick decision as simple as to what we will eat for lunch. We may also have to make fast critical decisions, such as how to avoid an impending car accident: do we brake, swerve or accelerate. And it's just this \\"rapid cognition\\" that Gladwell writes about so well that can make the difference.<br /><br />One could easily assume that BLINK is about dealing with intuition, as a colleague of mine thought when I described the book. That's not what it's about, because intuition is more of a concept used to describe our \\"gut feelings,\\" our emotional reactions that aren't always very rational. BLINK deals with those rational first two second that are our rapid cognition.<br /><br />Gladwell points out that contrary to the way were raised from childhood, there are times of stress and high pressure when fast judgment calls and first impressions are a better choice than slow, deliberate thinking for making sense of the world around us.<br /><br />His examples are superb: code breaking during World War II, speed dating, marriage, medical malpractice (insightful - do read it twice). He even covers things as unusual as what you can discover about a person by being aware of what you see when looking around their bedroom, and interesting views about the best car dealer in New Jersey. You'll just have to read the book to understand where rapid cognition fits in.<br /><br />There is an entire chapter dealing with the power of \\"thin slicing\\" that deals with what some psychologists have recognized is our ability to make good judgement calls based on the \\"thinnest slice of experience.\\" The author delves into this subject quite well, and the examples that he offers are amazing.<br /><br />But can rapid cognition go wrong? It it always the right way to approach things? Just read about what Gladwell calls the \\"Warren Harding Error\\" for the answer. He makes a compelling case for the fact that we can and will make \\"Warren Harding Errors\\" in so many types of circumstances, especially when it comes to hiring personnel. His suggestions here will help one recognize the differences between good rapid cognition and bad rapid cognition. Split-second decisions can often be either more accurate than many months of project management or scientific planning, or they can become tragic disasters. In this book the author shows that you can educate and exercise your rapid cognition to avoid hazardous traps.<br /><br />We all recognize the importance of what happens in dating relationships at that instance when two people first meet. But it seems difficult to face the significance of what happens in the critical first seconds when we interview someone for a job, someone offers a new idea, or when a police officer has to make a critical quick decision at the moment a crime is being committed. Gladwell makes a compelling case to make us take rapid cognition as a part of our critical thinking process.<br /><br />BLINK deals with those small situations we all face in our daily lives, with assumptions that show up when we meet new people, make important personal and business decisions under stress, or when we are forced to meet complex situations head-on.<br /><br />This is one of those books that comes along and changes the way that you see the world around us. It's a fairly fast read, neither too light nor too heavy, and if you're anything like this reader, you'll want to read it a second time just to get a bit more out of it.<br /><br />Highly recommended, a keeper and easily worth a five-star rating. And now I have to get and read Gladwell's previous book, THE TIPPING POINT.<br /><br />Please also see my review of FREAKONOMICS, by Steven Levitt. Another reader emailed me, noting that Gladwell had said that Steven Levitt \\"has the most interesting mind in America.\\" I agree.time just to get a bit more out of it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never been so addicted to a TV show, and that goes for everyone else I've let borrow it! Everyone in my office and all my family members took it thinking, I'm not really going to like this - it's not my type of show. Well, EVERYONE has become addicted!<br /><br />Watch it. Buy it. And watch it again. Watch the special features - there are some great deleted scenes! Then go watch the movie Serenity. And pray that Joss (creator) will make another movie or TV series.
031286504X|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorites.<br />My only critique is that he sacrifices description for action.  The audience has to realy on its imagination to fill the visual cues.  Of course, that is also Matheson's greatest strength.  We are not bogged down with overly picturesque descriptions that distract from the dialogue and action.<br />It revolves around Robert Neville, the last man alive on Earth.  Everyone else has succumbed to a strange virus that has turned all others into vampires.  Now he works tirelessly to solve the riddle to save himself--and perhaps others.<br />I have met some people who were put off by Nelville's obssessiveness on researching the virus strain.  I disagreed, thinking it was the one thing that kept him from going insane from his isolation.  It is his only outlet.<br />Matheson deftly articulates his craft, able to give the reader just as much angst, despair, desperation, and disappointment as Neville.  He does find other humans and they lead him to new highs and lows in life.<br />Next to Dracula, this is the best Vampire Novel of all time.  And Matheson proves why he is one of the best writers of the 20th Century.
B00000295Y|5.0|Black Sunday alone is enough to know why The Hill is one of the best latin Hip Hop group ever.  They spit out extreamly catchy, crazy beats and Sen Dawg/B Real spit out vers by vers and keep it real.  This is probably 2nd place for best Hill album(first going to Temple of Boom and 4th being IV).  Some of the best work The Hill has done is featured on this amazing hip hop album.  I for one don't understand why Kroq plays \\"Insane in the membrane\\" on there station, sure the Group has gone a little \\"rock\\" but that doesn't mean they have abandon they're true hip hop(ness?...)Plus there 5,6th and 7th albums were just plain average(and those were when they started spitting out metal/rap or how ever you want to call it)...If you want a true Hip Hop CD to listen to cop this now.  The best tracks on this amazing CD is \\"I want to get high\\" which is a pretty good song to listen to when YOU'RE high, \\"Cock the Hammer\\" which is the best song on the album, \\"Hits from the bong\\", \\"I ain't going out like that\\" \\"Lick a Shot\\" \\"When the Sh...goes down\\" \\"Lil Putos\\" \\"Hand to the Glock\\"...Amazing album... <br /> <br />5/5 Star Material...but that doesn't mean it's still better then \\"Temple of Boom\\" which is by far there best Album ever..
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I enjoyed every moment of this movie. It followed the comic to true form and added a little spice with the Rash Al Goul character. I wish they would have added more about the Joker in the next film. But hopefully they make the Joker as badass as the Batman. The man behind the Bat was an excellent choice and having Chicago as Gotham City was a plus.
B00004R9A4|4.0|In 1971, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, a film many call a Mary Poppins rip-off, premiered at Radio City Music Hall, but in a version in which nearly half an hour of footage, including full songs, was removed. For its 25th Anniversary in 1996, Disney re-inserted all of the deleted footage except for one musical number in which the picture was lost. The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences screened this in 1996, but it didn't get a theatrical release, and for years, the only way Americans could get it was either by the 1997 laserdisc release, an import of a European video, or by catching it on occasion on the Disney Channel. <br /> <br />Finally, in 2001, for the film's 30th Anniversary, Disney released a DVD with this extended version of the film. Restored and remastered, the film now has a clearer plot, extended musical numbers, and songs previously deleted. The brilliant \\"Portobello Road\\" number is now restored to its original running time, as well as Miss Price's response verses, titled \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" during Mr. Browne's song \\"Eglantine,\\" and the previously entirely deleted songs \\"With A Flair\\" and \\"Nobody's Problems\\" are restored to the film. <br /> <br />The DVD is a mixed bag. The transfer is quite nice, but Lowry Digital, who did the recent Mary Poppins, Bambi, and Cinderella DVD restorations, could punch it up a little, as on occasion, I saw a bit of grain, and the occasional film artifact, especially during the closing credits and Walt Disney Pictures logo. However, this film has still never looked better on home video, so it's fine with me. <br /> <br />The extras could have been better. An actual making-of on the film would have been nice, including footage used in the Music Magic featurette. While that featurette does give some nice insight on the restoration, there's nothing behind-the-scenes about it except for the creation of the music score. Nothing about the effects, actors, nothing. But it's worth a look for info on the film's 1996 restoration. A larger gallery would have been nice. I do like the inclusion of the two cartoons. And of course, I'm happy to see that they have included theatrical trailers. <br /> <br />The best supplement, however, is the deleted song A Step In The Right Direction. That song was the catalyst that jump started this restoration project to begin with, so there's a bit of irony here in the fact that they couldn't find the footage of the song. So the supplement on the DVD, which is ported over from the 1997 laserdisc and was shown after the movie when the Disney Channel aired the restored version, is reconstructed using still photos of the scene and the original soundtrack. Hopefully one day, the footage will be found and they will be able to reinstate the number into the film, or at least they'll decide to include the photo reconstruction a la the restored version of A Star Is Born with Judy Garland. <br /> <br />Some have complained that there isn't an option to watch the original, shorter version due to its length and/or the poor dubbing of the voices in deleted scenes. (For much of the non-musical deleted footage, original dialogue soundtracks could not be found, so many of the deleted scenes had to be re-dubbed.) While I prefer the restored version despite the dubbing flaws, I think it would be wise of Disney to release both versions on DVD. Next year is the 35th Anniversary - maybe Disney will make a 2-disc DVD featuring both editions, with bonuses spread out on each disc, to appease all fans. Or better yet, a 3-Disc Collector's Edition, with discs 1 and 2 containing both cuts of the film and disc 3 with all the supplements. While neither edition is likely, the 2-Disc is a more likely option. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I can heartily recommend this DVD. The film has been lovingly restored and remastered, featuring almost all of the footage left on the cutting room floor in 1971, and features a nice handful of bonuses.
B000000H6D|1.0|type o negative started out as a kind of hate metal thrash band with their debut \\"slow, deep, and hard.\\"  they certainly sounded nothing like they do today, but their style back then was fun in a mean-spirited kind of way.  they had a \\"live\\" album which was basically a rehash of their debut, and then they made \\"bloody kisses.\\" <br /> <br />i guess you could call \\"bloody kisses\\" the precursor to modern type o negative.  the general tone is there, the intense gothic elements, and peter steele's vampiric moan.  except that unlike their albums starting with \\"october rust,\\" this album is simply terrible.  one good song does not a good album make. <br /> <br />\\"christian woman\\" is the album's sole good song.  the rest contain varying amounts of stupidity and downright suck.  \\"black number one,\\" despite being popular, is stupid.  it's basically a goth in-joke with idiotic lyrics.  and the rest of the album gets worse as you go.  minor highlights among the badness are \\"we hate everyone\\" which is funny for about ten seconds, and the occasional good musical bit among peter steele's godawful lyrics.  in fact, a few songs, like \\"bloody kisses\\" and \\"too late frozen\\" might have been better without the lyrics. <br /> <br />i want to stress that type o negative is my favorite band.  \\"october rust\\" is the best album in the world, and their most recent \\"life is killing me\\" is amazing as well.  if you like the gloomy stupidity of goth stereotypes, then maybe you'll get a kick out of this album, but if you actually want good music and lyrics to accompany the gothic undertones, then get type o's later albums.
0066620996|5.0|I may, by now, be the last person in America to read Collins' best-seller. No matter, it's exceptional. Using extensive quantitative research, Jim Collins and his team arrived at a set of fundamental differentiators that distinguish great companies from merely good ones. <br /> <br />How, for example, did Walgreens outperform the market by a factor of fifteen times, while its competitor Eckerd turned into an industry laggard? How did Kimberly-Clark meet and beat the master marketers at P&G? And how could Nucor take on -- and soundly defeat -- US Steel? Simple, Collins tells us: all exhibited a suite of traits that supercharged corporate performance. <br /> <br />To illustrate the point: had you invested one thousand dollars in Walgreens in 1975, that stake would have been worth over $560,000 by the year 2000. Contrast that performance with the great names of corporate America: Intel ($309,000), GE ($119,000), Coke ($73,000), Merck ($64,000), and the general market ($37,000). <br /> <br />In a nutshell, the traits include: <br /> <br />o \\"Level 5 leadership\\" - leaders that exhibit a unique combination of personal humility and professional discipline with ambition focused on the company, not the individual. <br />o \\"First Who, then What\\" - getting the best people on board, then worrying about fine-tuning corporate direction. <br />o \\"Confront brutal facts, without ever losing faith\\" - also termed \\"the Stockdale Paradox\\", this trait involves seeking the truth of the current situation while maintaining a certainty in victory. <br />o \\"The Hedgehog Concept\\" - fundamental discipline at the intersection of what your organization has passion for, what it can be the best at, and knowing the single metric that drives your economic engine (e.g., dollars per customer-visit, if you're a retailer). <br />o \\"A culture of discipline\\" - sustaining excellent results requires nuturing a culture of displined people taking displined action, consistent with the Hedgehog Concept. <br />o\\"The flywheel\\" - good-to-great transitions never happen in one grandiose re-org; instead, they are the result of a consistent sequence of buildups and breakthroughs, one after the other. <br /> <br />Like all great ideas, from the perspective of hindsight, Collins' characteristics look simple, dry, and boring. The book is anything but: it is a unique combination of research report, historical retrospective, and incisive analysis. Put simply, if you work in a business (!), you owe it to yourself to read this book.
B00005JKDR|5.0|If Cars is good, which I hope it is cause trailers don't make it look good, then Monsters Inc is probably my least favorite Pixar film. But of course like the saying goes, it's not my favorite but it's still good. It just doesn't have the hilarity of Toy Story 2, the amazing technical ability of Finding Nemo or the energy of the Incredibles. In the end, Monsters Inc is like films such as Bambi or Dumbo, they're not funny but they still entertain us regardless. <br /> <br />In the world of Monstropolis, their power comes not from traditional electricity but from childrens' screams turned into energy. So we have \\"scarers\\", monsters who use a vast supply of doors that lead into a child's bedroom and literally scare the kids to get the screams. Only problem is kids are getting really hard to scare. Top scarer Sulley working late one night finds a door left behind, and a kid. And monsters have been conditioned to believe kids are dangerous so he tries avoiding her only she's really attached to him.  <br /> <br />Only he can't really bring her back because Sulley's rival Randall is after her. Helping out Sulley is Mike, his assistant, and figuring out how to bring \\"Boo\\" back to her own room without being detected. This leads to an impressive animation sequence where they see just where all the doors are. <br /> <br />The film may not be as funny as previous entries(or for that matter, the next 2) but it's certainly got a warmth and heart to it, something definately lacking in today's animation films. Pretty much bringing all the charm almost single-handedly is \\"Boo\\", the girl who ends up in Monster world. Speaking in baby talk and a word now and then, she's certainly the kind of child you'd want to have. Billy Crystal plays Mike and he's got that manic voice going on that Robin Williams did in Aladdin(and again in Robots). <br /> <br />One thing that is a sight to watch is the technical aspect of the animation. One scene early on when Mike and Sulley walk to work certainly looks vibrant and colorful and Sulley's hair looks great plus the aforementioned \\"door room\\". The humans are certainly looking better too, the Toy Story humans definately looked odd but they've gotten better, with their best probably being their last film, the Incredibles. <br /> <br />The only one I'm missing for Pixar films on DVD is Toy Story 2 and of course that comes out boxing day(and obviously Cars but that's not even in theatres out, here's hoping it's good) but this film certainly is good, even if you have a child(ren) or not.
0446677450|5.0|The first time I read this book was six years ago on a visit to a cousin in California. It impressed me with its common-sense approach to accumulating wealth and letting money work for you instead of your working for money.  Being a high school economics teacher, I decided to make this book mandatory reading for my gifted and honors classes.  This may be one of the best decisions I have made, since this is one book I do not have to MAKE them read; they WANT to read it.  I give it a top rating not only for the lessons it teaches; but the WAY it teaches.  The approach is simple, straightforward, and uses real-world examples that appeal not only to adults, but teenage readers as well.  The lessons learned will make anyone more likely to build assets and not let liabilities rule thier lives.

0316172324|3.0|This is a strange book. There are some flashes of brilliance, of \\"Wow! I had not thought about it\\", but there are also many moments in which it becomes really hard to understand what Gladwell wants to communicate.    The author's main point seems to be that we have the ability to make quick judgements and analyses of people/ artifacts/ situations. This is an argument \\"against\\" the typical idea of a complete, thorough, time-consuming analyses. It's an interesting proposal and its based on psychological studies of people's behavior.    But, beware!, he asserts that we should notice that this quick judgements and analyses must be somehow based on \\"looking at the right items\\" (a sort of Pareto -80/20- rule) in each situation. Being quick does not mean being right.    So, his point is that, carefully trained (thus with the ability to distinguish what is truly relevant), people can make snap assessements with a good level of accuracy.    On the positive side, I will say that:  - The author's main point is worthy of a book  - As in \\"The Tipping Point\\", he provides many interesting examples and anecdotes, from many sources (by example: military exercises, autist experiments, art, food tasting, etc.).   - In general, his writing is \\"smart\\" and in some moments in makes you reflect upon your own life and situations you face in it where you could apply his theory    On the negative side:  - The structure of this book is terrible. I think I got the point of the book now, when I'm writing this note. But it moves you back and forth between different \\"dilemmas\\" and you never are really sure what we wants to say. Not even at the end. Terrible structure.  - Well, his argument is not rocket science. If you're looking for ground-breaking thougths, this will not amuse you.     In short, this is a nice book with some interesting thoughts, backed with many anecdotes and results from psychological tests. Read it if you have time, if you just want to enjoy the stories behind the argument, and if you do not mind the confusion in its structure. Otherwise, skipt it. Time is short. There are other better sources of information and entertainment.    P.S.:   1 - I have the sense this book could be the source for a nice documentary. Many of the experiments and situations (for example, face reading) are very well suited for the screen.  2 - Due to the hype surrounding Gladwell's work and to the fact that the Tipping Point was really a cool and ground-breaking book, I have rated this book a 3. Had it been his first book, it could have been a 4.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Many people mock and ridicule Jesus Christ but I think after watching Passion of the Christ many would change their attitude towards Jesus Christ. Mel Gibson does a marvellous job at showing the world what it would've been like for Jesus Christ the day he was crucified. Jesus Christ deserves respect and admiration for what he went through for what he believed in and Mel Gibson has done a fantastic job at showing people how it would've been like. If anyone mocks Jesus Christ I ask them have they watched Passion of the Christ and 9 times out of 10 they haven't. Those that have from my experience have changed their attitude towards Jesus Christ thanks to Mel Gibson's movie. However, Jesus Christ's life wasn't just about the crucifixtion but also, the resurrection. I was disappointed to see Mel end the movie after Jesus' death. I think the story is really incomplete because the resurrection is just as important. With that said this is one movie I would recommend to anyone even those who don't believe in Jesus Christ.
0689878451|5.0|I'm not sure what planet \\"Lou H, Children's Librarian\\" is on, oh that's right, it's South Carolina.  How very sad for the children of South Carolina to have such a closed-minded librarian in their midsts.  Lighten up, Lou.  There's no \\"propaganda\\" or  \\"indoctrination\\" between the lines of this lovely and true story.  As any biologist will tell you, this kind of pairing in nature takes place all the time. <br /> <br />And it is a lovely story.  It could probably be a bit easier to share on a broad scale had the author(s) left the purely subjective line out about keeper Mr. Gramzay thinking penguins Roy and Silo \\"...must be in love.\\"  But overall, it is a beautiful (true) story about families and loving fathers.

B000AADYRQ|2.0|Let's get right to it:  This cd is slow and boring and overproduced.  Positivie reviewers might call it \\"melancolic and soulful\\"...but it is boring.  I'm a Death Cab fan and I wanted so badly to like it...but I just can't.  It makes me sleepy everytime I listen to it.  If you are expecting any of the semi-upbeat sound of Transatlant...you will not find it here.  <br />My suggestion, save your money or spend it on Arcade Fire's cd called Funeral!!!
1573223026|3.0|I am a big Hornby fan. I loved \\"About a Boy\\" and \\"High Fidelity\\" even before they were made into blockbuster films with attractive leading men. But Hornby kind of lost me with \\"How to Be Good\\" and he's only partially recovered my loyalty with this, his latest novel. The story of a Gang of Four who become a dysfunctional family of sorts when they meet at the local do-yourself-in tall building on New Year's Eve, \\"A Long Way Down\\" is told from mutliple points of view. Hornby does an excellent job of adapting perspective in a believable manner, and though the premise is far-fetched, his versimilitude in terms of language and life philosophy gets this reader to suspend her disbelief. The book lags in the middle third, and only partially recovers by the end. There are more laughs than in \\"How to Be Good,\\" and the ending is quite light, considering where the book began. Worth a read, but far from his best.
068987474X|5.0|Nine months ago I was dating a man who was displaying all the signs of being \\"just not that into me.\\"  Towards the end of our relationship he would only call every few days, and claimed he was busy studying every single weekend for months on end.  However, I knew the truth deep down was that he just did not want to be with me anymore.  I ended up reading and purchases this book just three days before he called me up and tried to break up with me on the phone.  Even though all my common sense and this book told me not to, I begged this fellow not to break up with me.  Well our relationship lasted exactly one week longer and it ended with me telling him how much he hurt my feelings in front of his friend.  Guess what?!  He never called me again!  So I should have just followed the advice in this book and let the guy break up with me when he wanted to.<br /><br />This book is very good and helping me see that:<br /><br />1. You should never pursue a guy who has made it clear he is not into you.<br /><br />2. You should never IM a guy a month later to find out why he never contacted you again.<br /><br />3. You should focus on your own life and you will meet the \\"one\\" when you least expect it, and at a time when you are doing productive things for yourself.<br /><br />I am an educated and successful woman, but I have made some STUPID mistakes when it comes to \\"love.\\"  My advice to all young ladies is if a guy cannot manage to call when he says he will and makes you feel uncomfortable, even if he is \\"into you \\" he is not worth having.

B0006FFRVG|5.0|Keane has got to be the best band to come along in years, if you love brilliant pop music (esp. of the UK variety). Keane songs are indeed brilliant. <br /> <br />Every track on this record is amazing. Most are upbeat, but even the slower ones stick in your head. <br /> <br />I hope this band writes more stuff FAST. And how about a concert DVD or two? If you haven't heard them live yet...they're even better! <br /> <br />BTW, I haven't had a single problem backing up a Dualdisc yet. I like to back up all my CD's so I don't have to worry about scratching them, etc, and store the originals in a safe place. I've backed up both the CD and DVD sides of my Dualdiscs on recordable CD/DVD's no problem. I'm a Mac/OSX user, though, so I'm able to back up even copy-protected CD's without issue too. Can't speak for windows OS.
1400034779|4.0|When someone who isn't a mystery reader recommends a mystery, I always want to read it, and this one was recommended by my sister-in-law. It's a sweet little book, and while I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped, I did enjoy it. I prefer more traditionally-constructed mysteries. Worth a read, and I definitely plan on picking up some of the author's other series
B0000047EC|5.0|One of the most relaxing CD's I have ever heard.  Well worth the money and then some.
0385474547|4.0|I enjoyed this book but found it underwhelming--initially.  I wondered if I missed the point so decided to check out what others thought about it.  Seems like many experienced this book as a profound and gut wrenching story of the destruction of a way of life.  No doubt it is, but Achebe's ambiguous rendering of it left me with mixed feelings.  I now believe this is his intent, and the genius of the story.   This is not some sob story about the destruction of the noble savage, nor does it show, as some have written, that the imperialists are \\"better\\" than the backward Africans.  (These are the folks that actually missed the point.)  This story is simply about things falling apart, which is what they tend to do.  Achebe leaves the judging and moralizing to the reader, but I think I'll not commit that sin. I wondered why I am so uncomfortable with ambiguity when that is actually the way everything unfolds... or falls apart.  This book is good because it approaches the truth rather than attempting to package it for us.
B000AL730O|3.0|As others have mentioned, Fine Line bears some resemblance to Flaming Pie, Jenny Wren is Blackbird redux, and I'd say Friends to Go has some striking similarities to Another Day. This Never Happened Before? Yes, it did. At The Mercy (my apologies to the many reviewers who seemed to like it) sounds like it was written in five minutes, at gunpoint. English Tea proves that Pie isn't the only thing Flaming in Macca's repetoire. And I cannot believe that someone who recorded You Know My Name (Look Up The Number) to spoof lounge singers would come up with a Perry Coma vehicle like A Certain Softness (reminiscent of Till There Was You). Quality of lyrics are also inconsistent. But having said all of that, this is still a listenable and worthy body of work. The production and musicianship are reminiscent of Beatles albums, tight and crisp. Paul sounds every bit of 63, but he can still sing remarkably well. As always, he makes the best of whatever material he has. Not his best, not his worst, and more authentically Beatlesque than anything else you'll find out there. <br />
0783240287|2.0|Even for the musical genre, even for the Christian theme genre, this movie is silly beyond words, without being funny.<br /><br />It is \\"Springtime For Hitler\\" as envisaged by Zero Mostel in the Producers with every trite dance move ever invented.<br /><br />Joseph's brothers as would be Elvis/Billy Ray Cyrus impersonators takes the cake.
B00063F8B2|5.0|One of the reasons I have this soundtrack is the song \\"Believe\\" by Josh Groban! This is certainly going to be a new holiday classic. The C.D. also has some wonderful tracks from years gone by! It will be something you will enjoy listening this and every Christmas!!
B0007OASII|5.0|Fantastic vocals, superb musicianship, exceptional songwriting and stellar production all meshed perfectly on this one. <br /> <br />This was my first disc from Kamelot and while I have since purchased their previous three discs, all of which are very good, this one is absolutely amazing.  Not since \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" from Queensryche have I been floored like this.  This is easily my favorite music purchase in the last few years and I can't say enough about it.  Do yourself a favor, buy it and enjoy it. <br />

B000929AJQ|4.0|I am 25 years old and have been listening to NIN since I was allowed to. To me it's not as much as how you remember NIN as it is how much you've followed their journey. Now granted, With Teeth is a different, albeit BOLD turn from the general feel of their older things but it isn't bad by any means. If there was no internet, no way to absorb hype, and no worries of what newbie teenie-boppers (who automatically give this album 5 stars) think and just the general skepticism hovering over this album even before it's released, then you wouldn't be as inclined to start pointing out every single pro or con with this album. I swear people must sit and listen to this and just look for anything that doesnt sound pleasing to the ear just to falsely magnify what the general concensus thinks is wrong.  <br /> <br />I'll use one song as an example. \\"Only\\" - -  the people comparing it to a casio keyboard - sure it does (the casio SK-1 sampler 'disco' beat to be exact) sound like that initially but think of the memories this song invokes, the retro-synth sounds, reminds me of days long ago when i used to play with that casio, and being a retro gamer (nes) it reminds me of the archaic yet utterly satisfying chops of 8-bit times... When he made that song he knew he was creating a retro-atmosphere and to someone like me it hits home. Thats just one example... I could go on about the other songs but this isn't a novel. <br /> <br />    Trent is an artist. You don't have to listen to his music. For me it's looking at it from different angles and enjoying it from his perspective. Anything it invokes upon the listener is bonus. This album is not as much of a journey from start to finish like The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, nor does it have the endless layers of ambience and hypnotism of the aforementioned but it's more like bits and pieces of a much larger puzzle. Anyone whom NIN applies to not having this album is seriously missing a very important piece in their NIN lineup, if notmusic itself.  <br />
B000002A46|5.0|I love this C.D. with Mariah! Two of my favorites is All I Want For Christmas Is You and Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child! The latter is a hand clapping Christmas tune I know you will enjoy. All of the tracks are first class! Enjoy this one!!
B000BNX3AU|4.0|This was a good movie and cute, but it wasn't brilliant.  I always love John Cusack - he's great, talented, handsome and fun to watch, but this lacked something.  I think the writting was bad.  No one in the theater laughed at the 'funny' lines and neither did I.  The story line was good and kept me interested, but it just wasn't strong enough.  Stockard Channing was very good in this and Dianne Lane too.  It's a shame that this didn't quite pull off what I'm sure the director/producer etc hoped to.  It is definately a chick flick and any fan of John Cusack will love it.
B000002LBH|5.0|It's fun to read reviewers in hushed tones and aging skin describe the depth of their souls touched by this album. It's fun because I know what they are talking about. If forced to choose, I'd say this is their best.
0767827791|2.0|The movie itself is classic entertainment, and my wife and I have enjoyed our VHS tape of it (in \\"letterbox\\" format) many times. However, our recent purchase of the DVD was a disappointment due to (1) the \\"pan and scan\\" format and (2) the poor color quality characterized by a brownish tinge throughout much of the movie, making it look \\"old\\".  <br /> <br />Until a restored version is available on DVD, I recommend avoiding the DVD and settling for the VHS tape. The sharpness of the DVD may be a little better than the tape, but the letterbox and color tones of the tape far outweigh the surprisingly marginal quality of the DVD. Such a great motion picture deserves a better DVD.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|There is just something enticing about witnessing a band during the initial stages of their musical careers, especially when they have all the trimmings to be the next big thing and trust me, Paramore, a little rock band from Franklin, Tennessee are just that. <br /> <br />As such, it's easy to take a band like Paramore to heart; you want them to succeed as much as you want that backstage pass for Warped Tour and its' great to know them now when they are still approachable without tons of bodyguards sheltering them. I ask this question, how could you not like a good rock/pop album full of well-timed anthems all fronted by a cute girl vocalist. <br /> <br />Again how could you not like it? All We Know Is Falling is the most refined rock infused pop/punk album you're ever likely to find...with a lead vocalist (Hayley Williams) aged only sixteen years. But don't let this discrepancy fool you, she is well beyond her years. Williams has formed her entire life around fine-tuning her voice for just the right moment such as this. \\"Brighter\\" and \\"Conspiracy\\", a collection of songs that let Williams soar with poise allowing her to convey every note with that exact and tuneful precision on both the low and high ends of the scale. She truly does have a voice and her lyrical messages are both clear and direct. <br /> <br />Don't begin doubting the backing band either. The remaining members of Paramore (bassist, John Hembree; guitarists, Josh Farro and Jason Bynum; and drummer, Zac Farro) pack enough punch on \\"Emergency\\" alone to thrust them into the limelight of pop/rock where they certainly won't be overlooked with strong instrumentation. One listen to their first single and you'll think twice about classifying them as another band trying to deceive listeners into a false sense of talent. It's also apparent that after a few listens, they are anything but marketable material derived from the mind of some corporate executive waiting to get rich quick, they do their music from the heart. <br /> <br />Sure, they stuff All We Know Is Falling with a hell of a lot of poppy choruses, but I'll be the first to admit, I'm just a sucker for a catchy hook, all it takes for me to get reeled in is a good 15 seconds. And when that's backed by sophisticated riffs and skillfully contorted picking that most bands could only dream to create on a debut album, especially again at this very young age. Still don't trust me? Think I'm only jumping on an early bandwagon? Williams' own classification for the band claims \\"it's high energy, and it's pretty aggressive and intense...and it's cool that we aren't being looked down on because we're a girl fronted band. I don't think that just because we're different in that area it's going to limit us.\\" <br /> <br />While Paramore's struggle to find balance and normalcy amongst continual touring and recognition becomes evident on \\"Franklin\\", the slowest song on the album. All We Know Is Falling makes a strong cover story suggesting otherwise; successfully drawing off of real life experiences that prove Paramore can overcome the loss of a band member (Jeremy) in the crucial stages and still come out strong. If you didn't know any better, you'd think Paramore are veterans to the scene, not just entering it for the first time. And with the help of other bands such as Fall Out Boy, The Academy Is..., Copeland and Straylight Run, it won't be long before we all start hearing of them. <br /> <br />I guess what I love so much about this album is its' honesty, sincerity and most importantly in today's music world, simplicit nature.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I avoided this show thinking it was just a cheap teenage version of the great character Superman. I read some good reviews and I knew the show had survived for 5 seasons now, so I rented this entire season. I'm glad I did! The show is fun, funny, sweet, and just plain cool at times. I am also in love with Kristin Kreuk (My God...what a beautiful face). I would watch the show for her alone, but thankfully the show is almost up to par with her looks. I will be watching the new season that is currently running and I will rent the remaining seasons in the future.
0312305060|2.0|I have gone through it,not without prodding myself to forge ahead despite quiet boredom setting in gradually.I started reading it and thought it was well written and we might be heading into something interesting,then i just could not help feeling i did not care much for the characters. What can i say? It was a disapointing read and the ending twist was not much of a surprise. Sorry Mr. Cunningham  your talent for writing and the telling of the story did not happen for me in this book.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Hugh Grant hilariously redefines the word \\"playboy\\" in the first half of this film (directed with surprising tact by the Weitz Brothers, better known for American Pie), then gets human, without losing his comic edge. <br /> <br />\\"About a Boy\\" exploits Hugh Grant's edge and much of his considerable charm in its story of a 38-year-old London bachelor who accidentally becomes entangled in the life of a 12-year-old boy. In addition to being a smart comedy, it's an honest movie about childhood that avoids sappiness and sentiment and goes in unexpected directions.  <br /> <br />Throughout the hilarity of the script, the movie is really about the two boys -- the big one and the little one and about how each has something the other one needs.  I appreciated and enjoyed the humanity of the story, as sentiment is earned and not forced, and is always balanced with caustic humor.
B000A158TM|3.0|Manga has spent very little effort to bring this classic anime to your PSP. The only audio track is the English dub, so therefore there are no subtitles. Worse yet, the movie is presented in a widescreen format -- the original movie was not widescreen, so presentation in this format just cuts off the top and bottom of the scene. <br /> <br />Image quality is soft, and looks to be a straight conversion from the poorly done DVD Manga brought out a few years ago.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series.  Too bad it was cancelled, but awesome it was made into a full length film.  Of course, anything to keep actors off the streets is a good idea.  Even better when it's a worthwhile series like Firefly.
1410102033|5.0|I was so tired of reading all the ignorant reviews of this book that I had to share my point of view.  First off, political views aren't grounds to deffecate on a book that is a first hand account delving into THE MOST BRILLIANT AND SADISTIC MIND the world has ever known!  What else could you want in a reading.  haha Hitler Liberal?  Someone can actual fathom the thought of someone that wants to control everything as liberal?  Are you serious?  L. Boyles Sir I think you might have your facts messed up, because she meant that they were a right wing organization because they like to control anything and everything, from Newspapers to peoples choices, IE look at the US government right now trying to make womens choices for them by trying to make it illegal to be prochoice.<br /><br />Back to the book already!  It's nothing short of incredible.  I think everyone from any background or race should read this book.  It's just great.  You have to understand that to respect and actually enjoy this book you don't have to AGREE WITH IT!  I'm no nazi, I'm no racist, I'm simply a man with an open mind and open eyes.

B00081U6EG|3.0|...I agree with much of what has been written here. Just to summarize, as a musician, I enjoyed watching most of it; but it's pretty lame for such a momentous anniversary. Also: <br /> <br />1. Couldn't Fender round up some of it's signature artists (Clapton, Blackmore, etc.) ... even for taped appearances? <br /> <br />2. How lame to have a band with no keys, players using Gibson and other brand guitars, some musicians most people have never heard of. <br /> <br />3. How lame to see Paul Rogers struggling to read the lyrics to the finale (stay with me) and Ronnie Wood trying to direct the others; couldn't they have done a couple of rehearsals for such an event? <br /> <br />4. Ronnie Wood's voice shattered my fish tank and killed a guppy
B000002H33|5.0|Excellent follow-up to the classic Ride The Lightning, evolving even more with this one, more melodic intros, melodic breaks and stuff, and longer than most on Ride The Lightning, For instance \\"Disposable Heroes\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" are both 8 minutes, and \\"Orion\\" is 8 minutes long, the production is even better than Ride The Lightning, James' vocals are even better here, and of course the whole band does, like I said, it's alot more melodic than Ride The Lightning, adding more acoustic stuff, but don't let that fool you, it's a classic album, and the melodic breaks and intros and such adds more of a variety, don't get me wrong, Ride The Lightning is THE best, but this is a VERY good album, this album proves why they were one of the most known thrash band back then, not taking away from Megadeth, Exodus, Testament ect at all, so don't think that, this is NOT an overrated album, as I've seen/heard that it is, I grew up on this, and I'm sure alot of Metal fans did, people that say Metallica always sucked are just trying to be elite, and bash Metal classics, to make themselves feel more elite, anyways, heres a rundown... <br /> <br />Battery 5/5, a great opener, nice melodic acoustic intro, then moves into a wicked riffage thrasher, love the breaking riff before the solo, very catchy, great chorus too <br /> <br />Master of Puppets 5/6, probably the most known on the album, and it's indeed a thrash classic, 8 minutes full of great riffs, vocals, lyrics, very good epic song, most everybody has heard this <br /> <br />The Thing That Should Not Be 5/5, a nice SLOW song, more groovish sound, but very heavy and interesting, great lyrics also, Immoooooorrrrrrtal! <br /> <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) 5/4, the worst song on the album, still a good song though, just too slow and melodic, but gets kind of heavy, nice solo though <br /> <br />Disposable Heroes 5/6, GREAT song, picks up ALOT from the last track, alot faster/heavier, great riffs being thrown around here, thechorus is great, very catchy song, 8 minutes of Thrash! <br /> <br />Leper Messiah, 5/5, a little slower than the prior track, but in a heavy way, not as slow as The Thing That Should Not Be though, love the chorus, and the riffs are cool, BOW TO LEPER MESSIAHAAHHH! <br /> <br />Orion 5/6, They pull it off again, a great long instrumental, great riffs, acoustic melodies and such, alot of people don't really like it though, I don't get it, I always liked it, I think I even like it better than \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" off Ride The Lightning, I'm not taking anything away from that one, it's great, but I like this one <br /> <br />Damage, Inc 5/5, a nice closer, it's fast and furious, not much to say about it though, it's just a good song <br /> <br />There it is, this album is hailed as one of the best Metal albums of all time, and when you hear it, you will hear why, it's got great variety, and diversity, it's melodic and heavy all thrown into one album, I still like Ride The Lightning the best, but this is certainly a five star album, so is the next album \\"...And Justice For All\\" which focused even MORE on the melodic stuff, more acoustic intros, longer epic songs, theres not a song under 5 minutes on it, some say it was Metallica attempt at Doom, which could very well be, anyways, great album, another classic, should definetly be checked out if you're a Metal fan, later!

B000002H2H|5.0|Usually bands suffer a follow up to their debate, not Metallica, this is even BETTER, than Kill 'Em All, Kill 'Em All is great, but this totally blows it out of the water, the production is a bit better, James' vocals improved ALOT, the cover will give you a hint what you're in for, one hell of a thrashing, everything is improved on this album, from songwriting, to vocals, to guitar...Mustaine co-wrote to songs off this, whereas Kill 'Em All had 5 co-written by him, the ones he wrote are EXCELLENT, but Metallica could also write songs back then, coming out in 1984, same year as Iron Maiden - Powerslave (Also a great album)...Exodus - Bonded By Blood was SUPPOSED to be released this same year, but record company problems made it not so, if it was released when it was supposed to be, it may have been embraced as a landmark by more Metal fans today, BUT, it IS a landmark, I strongly suggest you to check that out, anyways, heres a rundown... <br /> <br />Fight Fire With Fire 5/5, A nice melodic acoustic intro, don't be fooled by it, when the guitar kicks in, you know what you're in for, WICKED riff on that, killer solo <br /> <br />Ride The Lightning 5/6! Jeez! what an intro riff, this song cannot be explained in words really, just listen to the riffs after the spectacular intro, then when it speeds up, AMAZING riffs, and a wicked solo makes for a killer song <br /> <br />For Whom The Bell Tolls 5/5, A slow, more groovish song, but it's still good, the riffs are cool as hell, and the outro, with the church bells and stuff, sounds dark and evil, it's a little outplayed, but I still enjoy it <br /> <br />Fade to Black 5/4, I know you guys are saying (5/4?!?!, he's nuts!), but, while I still like this song, it doesn't fit in that well, with the 3 tracks that come before, it's definetly a cool song, but not like the others, sorry guys, GOOD WHEN IT GETS HEAVY THOUGH! <br /> <br />Trapped Under Ice 5/6, KILLER, KILLER song, very thrashy, and heavy as all hell, interesting fact, I guess they stole this riff from Exodus, if you listen to Impaler off Exodus' Tempo of the Damned, the riff when it gets really fast, is IN THIS SONG!, but, whatever happened, both songs are great, it's not ALL the riffs in the song that were the same, just that one, but...whoever wrote it originally, GREAT RIFF! <br /> <br />Escape 0/0....PHEW, what a stinker, this doesn't even SOUND like Metallica, let alone BE on this album, it doesn't belong on ANY Metallica album, the only cool part is the outro with the sirens going off, other than that, this is a bomb <br /> <br />Creeping Death 5/6, WHAT A GREAT SONG, it MORE than makes up for the last track, GREAT intro, chorus, riffing, great solo...everything about it is EXCELLENT, skip Escape after the great Trapped Under Ice, Escape is no where NEAR this <br /> <br />The Call of Ktulu 5/5, a very nice instrumental, great way to close off such a great album, nice riffing in this, 8 minutes, making it the longest song on the album <br /> <br />A great album, a classic, wish they would have stayed like this, but, money talks, if you like Kill 'Em All, you'll like this even more, it totally kills Kill 'Em All, I'm not taking anything away from Kill 'Em All, it's a great album, but this one is the gem, everything about it is perfect, except for Escape, don't pay attention to that one, it's an awful song, as I stated, also, Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for All are classics also, even The Black Album is great...after than though...Gone, anyways, if you've never heard this, you're in for a treat, IF, you like Metal, if you don't, stay away from it, and if you like Nu-Metal, stay away from it, you won't like it, the riffs are more than one string open and close riff, LATER!
B000022TSH|5.0|In the brief interview writer Robert Towne, he said he spoke to a police officer whose beat was Chinatown.  The officer said in Chinatown you don't know if you are helping someone to commit a crime or if you are actually helping someone.  You could never know who to trust. \\"Do as little as possible when in Chinatown\\"....<br /><br /> Watching this classic for the first time with no preconceptions of what it was, other than the title, I have to say it lives up to its name.<br /><br />Not ever seeing the film,I thought Jack's detective character, Gittes was going to reveal the truth. Somehow he would find justice for his client.<br /><br />Just the opposite.  Like real life, he's powerless against the system. John Huston's character rules the town. Any good that he does is covered up by the police ...and he almost loses his life in the process. There's no Clint Eastwood style gun battles here where the good guys win. It's a timeless tale. It's like the world of today where mega corporations rule and sweep ethics under the rug...
B0000075ZB|4.0|I'm a huge bee gees fan and a huge Dionne Warwick fan so it was just a blast for me when I found out about this album. <br />You can hear the sweet sound of the bee gees doing back up for every single song on this album which adds much more flavor to Dionne's songs. <br />Overall, a very good album!
B000AM4PBS|5.0|this box set looks very tempting to me. I am thinking seriously to buy this. I have many friends who love the series. I just find the cast too much of an eye-candy. And I tend to associate pretty looks with bad acting. I could be very wrong, given that I have seen some episodes and the very promising film career paths the entire cast has so far.  <br /> <br />What the heck. I will get this. But first of all, need to find a storage space big enough for this.
B000002KLG|5.0|WOW!!! 2 incredible talents working on 1 album, you know there are gonna be fireworks!! <br />The new generation really needs to listen to albums like this in order to apreciate REAL TALENT!!! <br />I'm at my 20's myself and am discovering old music everyday and I must say that this album is one of the many few that's worth every penny becouse every song is incredible!! <br /> <br />
0783225903|5.0|Reading through the reviews here, I have a hard time finding a single one that fits the film at all.  Some of them were looking for an action based science fiction film like The Matrix or The Minority Report.  Others were looking for a screwball comedy (this is directed by a Python after all)  If that is what you want, then this film is not for you. <br /> <br />Brazil is catagorized as black comedy.  That makes it a sort of elaborate inside joke that takes a bit of thought.   <br /> <br />Brazil is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination. <br /> <br />It is a satirical 20th century world view on a bazaar imagination.  I'll actually admit here that it isn't the same kind of funny as Monty Python.  But it does share a satiracal note with Python works- if you think long enough you will realize just how familiar this science fiction world is. <br /> <br />So, I'll try digging for a proper comparison.  Fans of other Terry Guilliam works will like this film(12 Monkeys, Time Bandits)  People who I know who liked this film are fans of the works of Stanely Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange)  Many also love the works of Fritz Lang (Metropolis, M) and the rather less known science fiction film Pi. <br /> <br />Or people who love reading Franz Kafka.  In Fact, I'd say that Kafka is the best comparison I can make, hands down, and highly recommend his complete works (which I'm still reading). <br /> <br />Be warned, this is one of cinema's strangest.  That is why it defies catagorization so entirely.  That is likely why there are people who love or hate this film so quickly.  I rank it highly, but still have difficulty explaining it.
0780020693|5.0|I love Fellini's movies but for some reason, this was one I had missed until recently. <br /> <br />I agree with some people posting that the flatulence jokes and poor dialog took away from the movie. However, if you are telling a story from the point of view of a young teenage boy, then perhaps making fart jokes with your friends and being obsessed with sex is part of that experience. <br /> <br />Like Fellini's other films though, I found this movie to be very engaging. His technique is simply masterful! <br /> <br />My favorite scene in this movie was the one that takes place in the fog. A deep fog has rolled in and the evening is very quiet. The grandfather is beginning to wonder if he has died. He's experiencing confusion and he is having trouble finding the thing most familiar to him: his home. He only becomes re-oriented when he asks directions from a dark figure who is bicycling in the fog--a man who appears to have almost no head as he returns to the deeper part of the fog again. <br /> <br />The grandfather opens the gate to the family home and he sees his grandson leaving for school. As the boy walks along, the trees appear distorted and twisted, like witnesses to some awful destruction. A seemingly 'phantom' convoy truck with soldiers in the back passes by, perhaps foreshadowing events in the boy's own life just years ahead. Then, the scene becomes even more silent and the silhouette of a large bull becomes recognizable in the fog. Upon seeing the bull, which is looking at him dead center, the boy halts and very slowly takes a few steps backward. He freezes, and his profile begins to shrink, as you see this overwhelming sense of fear and helplessness on his face. To me, this scene appears as a disturbing prophetic vision of what was lying just around the corner for Italy and the rest of Europe.  <br /> <br />It's powerful scenes like this and the attention that Fellini puts into them, that makes his movies so wonderful to watch.  <br />

B000B5IPLK|5.0|MTV made a right move by having Alicia Keys relaunch the much anticipated rebirth of Unplugged. If her numerous performances at the 2005 Grammy's, 2005 VH1 Save the Music, and so on...are not convincing enough of her undeniable ability as a live perfomer, then you are obviously oblivious to her unparalled voice. Whether she is sitting down on the piano, or livening it up with a hype band, Alicia Keys manages to lure her audience in impressively. She doesn't have to dance, or do a choreographed number to get you interested. That factor alone makes it all the more reason why this live album is luring to an audience; she is simply doing what she does best...singing. Her impecable ability to write music that is not only relatable, but good to just listen to. Her masterpieces are always her ability to perform her music, and this is just a collection of masterpieces of R&B. A genius of her genre, Alicia will do for R&B what Marvin Gaye was able to...she is able to bring it back to life. Though the background singers did have a lot of intake in some of the performances, it only reflects off of Mariah's Unplugged when she dueted with Trey Lorenz, making a remarkable #1 hit together, and launching accessability to back up singers without controversy. Alicia is only expanding and will continue to exceed her role and title. She always outdoes her self, and respectably manages to keep it true to the music. Regardless of what you think of her, you cannot deny her. Love her, hate her, dont care for her...you still cannot disregard her. She brough it back to MUSIC with this one...and I love her for it!
B00004WLXZ|5.0|I do not understand why Leni Riefenstahl has been criticized so strongly for making this film.  For me it is an excellent documentary that could have given a warning what happened after 1934.  The blind trust in Hitler; the shell shocked SA whose leaders had just been executed; the arrogant Reichswehr general who looks rather bored when he has to watch the not exactly in synchrony marching Para militaristic organizations; the Reichswehr soldiers who are goose-stepping like an oiled machinery; the extremely arrogant and self-confident Himler; and Streicher whose speech must have so dumb that Leni could use only one sentence from his entire speech.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|I had to get this CD after listening to Buddy Guy's stunning live jam on NPR's World Cafe on October 13 and checking out the new songs on his web site.  This is one of the most beautiful complete albums I've heard in a whiile.  It's got some totally awesome, upbeat and timeless music, unlike the processed churned-out stuff today. Most pop albums nowadays have only one or two good tracks, the rest sucks. All tracks on Buddy's new album are quality and offer variety for different tastes. The breath of Buddy's musicianship, repertoire and dynamism amazes. Guitarists -- listen to Buddy's playing and weep.  He's a national treasure, too bad more Americans don't appreciate him as much as the rest of the world does.  Maybe Amazon needs to promote his music more, like they do for BB King.   I like the production on this album just fine.  If anything, it's a little underproduced in parts.  Buddy's albums have all been produced differently, and I like them all: Buddy's Baddest, Sweet Tea, Slippin In, Damn Right I've Got The Blues (Expanded Edition), Stone Crazy, Live: The Real Deal and D. J. Play My Blues are my favourites.   Last, the excellent reviews here shouldn't bother a few people.  Most reviews are very helpful to most people, informative about the album or artist, and not boring to read.
0800141660|5.0|What a great movie!  Have seen it several times before but DVD on big screen HDTV looks and sounds great.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is made up of a group of best friends who understand what being a kid is about. Songs like \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" and \\"Grow Up\\" are about being a teen and how annoying life can get. They sympathize with kids and everyone else.  <br /> <br />\\"I'll meet you there\\" says that no matter what happens in life, nothing can keep me from you. \\"I'd Do Anything\\" talks about a lost love and how they'd do anything and everything to see them again. \\"Perfect\\" is a shout out to parents and letting them know that it's hard to be a kid and they need you.  <br /> <br />Some people might say that they complain and hate their lives. They do not complain or hate their lives, their performing for the fans. They write songs about what kids deal with. They don't write about themselves, and frankly I wouldn't want a band to be talking all the time about their problems-i'd want them to be talking about me.  <br /> <br />Simple Plan's music has always been there for my friends and I as well as some adults I know. I can never get tired of this album. I find that Pierre's voice can cut through everything that is going on in the world. Just for a few minutes I can escape the world and be in a happier place.  <br /> <br />I think if a band is more concerned with their fans than themselves, they are worth listening to. Simple Plan has donated to LIVE8, the tsunami victims and Katrina. They always are there when the world is in need. Simple Plan has never labled themselves \\"Emo\\" or \\"Punk\\" or \\"Pop\\". they just play the way they want. I guess it could be labled \\"Rock\\" but in a Good Charoltte, Blink-182, Sum 41, Motion City Soundtrack way. If you are looking for \\"Emo\\" check out My Chemical Romance, The Used, and The Starting Line. And of corse if you are looking for \\"real\\" rock then go buy an AC/DC album because they kick butt. <br /> <br />The reason why I gave SP 5 stars is because they've earned it. They've been working since they were 13 and deserve RESPECT for giving it. So go buy this album and enjoy it. Or you can learn to respect people who are doing more than the average band.
B00006RU5B|4.0|You've got to be a metal fan in order to listen to this entire album straight. I Like rock, and a lot of metal, but good grief this is bordering on hard. I love it, and just bought the album for 'Like A Stone', I just can't listen to this whole thing. So with that said, go ahead and buy it and take your time.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|I really liked this movie.  I liked the Tim Burton trademark on it.  I loved the look of Johnny Depp.  I'm still not happy when people compare him to Michael Jackson, though. Where did that come from!? Still, I think the original movie is better for one reason.  It has to do with the character of Willy Wonka and I am not talking about the acting ability of Johnny Depp compared with Gene Wilder. Both of them are great actors!  But, the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka was definitely a morally better character than the Johnny Depp version.  The Johnny Depp Willy Wonka had some serious problems himself.  The back story of Willy Wonka in the new movie has nothing to do with the book and I believe there is a good chance that Roald Dahl would likely have objected to it.  (Note that he was on the set of the first movie.) I think it all combines to make the Johnny Depp character appear to be more of a \\"psychotic\\" Willy Wonka, especially when compared to the \\"eccentric\\" character of the book and the Wilder movie.  The moral high ground that the Gene Wilder character seems to have, makes it seem more natural that he has the authority and right to teach the kids and parents their lessons.  That being said, the new movie is otherwise a bit truer to the original story.  The advance of special effects allows them do some things that they couldn't do in the older movie. Moreover, the older movie looks dated, especially the scene of his mother working in the laundry.  My suggestion is to watch both movies.  On top of everything, don't forget to read the book.  It's a wonderful story.
0316666343|1.0|Usually I never read anything fiction, but I was grabbed by the idea of the author.  The haunting way the victom died still sits uncomfortably with me today.  It is too descriptive for a young reader, which it seems to be geared for.  Great Idea, But <br />not a good book for children or even teens.  I felt, that the subject was precariously written with too many assumptions...even as fiction.  It was a deeply disturbing depiction of a young girls life and death and afterlife with too many presumptions for any one with an education. What bothers me the most is the ommission of phisical and emotional and spiritual mingled thoughts the/a young girl might/would have <br />had before her untimely death instead of the methodical way the <br />death for the victom occurred, which might have gone over better for me if the writer was writing methodically for the <br />killers train of thought.  A young girl would have been traumitized, in shock and gone a many different places in her  <br />mind and soul than where the writer let the most important character in her story go.  I would have read on and finished the story if the death was less graphic and more emotionally fulfilling and realistic.  2ndly, the human nature instinct seemed to have  <br />gone out the window regarding the victoms reaction to being enclosed in such a small area with a stranger.  It would have <br />been more realistic to me if the author introduced the character as a child who was \\"simple\\" because then I could understand that particular chapter and persist with reading the <br />whole book.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Will a music CD be available some time soon? <br />I can't watch it in the car!! <br />Excellent!!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This album is simply fantastic.  The melodies are fascinating-Plant's experimenting with world music with great results.  Lyrically inventive.
B000062Y98|4.0|I love good rock and roll with influences of many different styles of music. Some of my favorite bands are Kansas, Jethro Tull, Rainbow (with Dio at the helm), Iron Maiden, Blackfoot, and Cat Stevens. <br />I don't understand why fans of one band think they must denegrade another band that plays a similiar style. <br /> <br />I'm starting to appreciate Blind Guardian. I had never heard of this band prior to a week ago. They have great talent and know how to make a great record. They, along with bands such as Iron Maiden, are expanding Heavy Metal beyond the confines of the typical shout chorus and songs about drugs and sex. I hear influences of many great bands such as Jethro Tull and Queen in their music. But there is no need to denegrate other bands just to prove how talented Blind Guardian is. <br />Above anything else, music should speak to you in a very personal way. It is all about the music. <br /> <br />Rock On!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is the best album of Mariah's career by none!  I've never heard her sound this R&B ever.  And she has took her game to that next level.  Your so use to hearing her songs on soft rock radio, but not anymore.  I loved how her voice carried through songs like \\"Circles\\" and \\"Joy Ride\\".  The R&B and Hip Hop beats of \\"Belong Together\\", \\"Like That\\", and \\"Say Something\\" is off the chain.  J.Durpi did great on his producing with Mariah and he deserves \\"Producer of the Year\\" from the Grammies!  So yes cope this album it has Grammy nominations written all over it.
B00001IVOR|4.0|WU-TANG SI BAAAAACK!We are in 1997 (R.I.P. Biggie Smalls),4 years after \\"Enter The Wu-Tang\\"'s boom.That cd was (and is) a classic. Can the Wu drop another classic?I'm sorry,but this double album hasn't got something.First of all,there are many differences between the discs:Disc n.I is an incredible whole of hits.RZA's sound becomes dark,noir and obscurus.You can listen it in songs like \\"For Heaven's Sake\\",one of the best Wu-Tang works,or in \\"A Better Tomorrow\\",masterpiece of \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\" produced by that genius of 4th Disciple.This last song is composed by pretty rhymes,wisdom,knowledge and sentiments.Every verse has got an important significate.Try to listen U-God's verse.You will cry.Beautiful.And,listen!In Disc n.I there is also \\"It's Yourz\\",powerful Wu-banger that appears also in \\"Legend Of The Wu-Tang\\",Wu's Greatest Hits.<br /><br />...Disc n.II is not so fantastic.Wait,there are great songs like \\"Triumph\\" (an epic reunion song),\\"The MGM\\" (\\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...\\" strikes back,produced by True Master) or \\"Little Ghetto Boys\\" (sad but genial),but there are incredible neadless pieces,too.A title? \\"Dog S**t\\",solist song of Ol'Dirty Bastard (r.i.p.). This is probably the worst \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\" song.ODB's voice is not very sweet and that RZA's beat sucks. Some track is average,not very impressive,like \\"Deadly Melody\\"(doped?maybe..).<br /><br />If you are a Wu fan you MUST have this cd in your collection.If you want listen something of dark and good,buy \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\".You will not remain dissappointed!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Ok, so here's the DVD version of one of the BEST SHOWS OF ALL TIME - WELL, I did say ONE of the best. It's an excellent show, and anyone who loves to watch this show MUST own the dvd! If you've never seen Veronica Mars before, WATCH IT! It makes you feel like you're right there in Neptune, CA (Fictional city?!?!?)  But it's a great little city, and I miss california so much, so it's great cause every week, on that tv station which ususally doesn't have that good of shows on, i can be there in california, solving misteries and checking out the cute surfer guys in California!  Gotta love the show, gotta love the DVD! <br />Bill :0)
0375757422|5.0|I tried to read this book when I was in middle school and quickly returned it to the shelf when I found it slow and boring.  I decided to give it another try and couldn't believe that I hadn't enjoyed it before.  \\"Emma\\" is not a work of deep and intense literature, but Austen deftly explores human motives and emotions.  Emma is consumed by the class system and buys into its importance, much like Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  Emma feels she has the power to change the system, especially where her friend Harriet Smith is concerned.  Emma must find out the hard way about class distinctions and friendship. <br /> <br />I'm not an avid Austen reader, in fact I'm quite a novice as far as she is concerned.  Maybe after I've read some more of her novels I won't value \\"Emma\\" as highly, but for now, this novel is high up on my list, and I enthusiastically reccomend it.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|A 3 hour special effects demo without a sense of historical accuracy, made only to collect ticket money from hormone-raged teenage girls obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. The only people who like this movie are girls. I've never known a single guy who likes this movie. <br /> <br />The only thing \\"Titanic\\" about this movie is the disgustingly large budget it was filmed on. The most successful movie of all time? Well, of course, teenage girls who work at McDonalds have more disposable income to use for things like going to the movie theater than any of us. Stay away from this big budget piece of Hollywood trash, it's not going anywhere near my collection.

B000BNX3AU|4.0|Nothing really new in the movie when it comes to romantic comedy - it's you average plot (no brain surgery here) I'm a big fan of Diane Lane, and she's great in Must Love Dogs. Cusack is great too -  and makes a great love interest to Lane. Even though the plot is typical, it's hard to ignore the sweetness and its funny jokes.

B0002EQ7E2|4.0|As a long time fan (since the 60's) of Simon and Garfunkel, I have all of their albums and most of their subsequent solo albums.  I bought this one on the recommendation of a friend.  It is great but not the Paul Simon of Kodachrome fame that I had come to appreciate.
B000AARKOO|4.0|First off this film is much better than Troy and Alexander combined. Ridley Scott's direction shows that he hasn't lost the ability to manage epics of this size. His talent as a former cinematographer and art director shows in spades in this film. The color palette changes from the cool, almost black and white scenes in France to the blistering earth tones of the scenes in the Middle East. If one can find any faults in Kingdom of Heaven it won't be for its art direction and cinematography. There are faults in this film, but not enough to ruin the film or slow it down the way it did for Troy and, to a greater degree, Alexander. The story seems to not want to create a specific bad guy to root for. Even the characters whose motives and behavior scream \\"villain\\" can be excused by their religious veiwpoints. This is one film where everyone involved makes decisions that can be seen as good or bad depending on the individual audience's point of view.<br /><br />The cast did an admirable job in getting lost in their roles. One specific stand-out has to be Ghassan Massoud's portrayal as Muslim General Salah al Din (Saladin to the West). Massoud has presence and is actually one of the few characters who seemed to go beyond the petty, religious politicking this film has piles of. I must admit that I never really believed Orlando Bloom as the character of Balian of Ibelin. He makes a convincing enough knight, but never as the protector of Jerusalem. Eva Green makes for nice eye candy, but I looked closely enough at her character develop and she did a better job as a young married princess much too cynical and old than what her appearance and age would suggest.<br /><br />But most people will come to see Kingdom of Heaven for its many battle set pieces. Outside of The Lord of the Rings battles, Scott's work in pulling off the battles between the Crusader and Templar armies against those of Salah al Din would count as some of the most brutal and massive engagement in film history. Scott did his homework well for these set pieces. As a military history buff I'm usually more critical of epic films depicting historical battles on film. There's not much to be critical about the accuracy of the Siege of Jerusalem. The final battle does look like it owes some of its execution to the Siege of Minas Tirith in the end of LOTR.<br /><br />The film succeeds well enough in recreating the fight for Jerusalem and the politics involved from all sides. The acting is very good overall though a few casting choices could've been made better. Overall this film is very underappreciated. Maybe people are not ready for an intelligent film about a contentious time involving two of today's major religions.homework well for these set pieces.

B00005OAIE|4.0|This album was received as a gift recently and although I had already been captivated whenever Mayer would be seen playing live on TV or video, I wasn't expecting such a refreshing album to completely encapture me.  The first six or so songs are completely the type to rewind and play over and over again, the following 7? songs are themselves, too, seeming to slowly grow into their own potential the more I listen to them.   <br /> <br />All in all, the album truly speaks to the listener - And Mayer's lyrics, being completely honest and down to such a truthful, vulnerable level, makes you thankful that such an artist can be willing to reach within to not only expose himself, but reveal that same place we all have within ourselves, too. <br /> <br />A+++++++++ Simply a \\"Must have\\" album for sure.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|After watching this movie after two years of procrastination, I asked myself why did I wait for two years to find such a gem.    If you are a fan of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\", \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\", then, you probably know what to expect on this one.  To make a subtle comedy romantic movie isn't easy because the storyline has got to be good, the cast needs to have chemistry, their comic timing has got to be impeccable, and the scripts need to be tight. I have to say that other than minor glitches, this movie simply breezes through.  What other reviewers said about underutilising Frances McDormand, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet is true but what bothers me more is that whilst all efforts are made to ensure that Jack's and Diane's characters are as wholesome as possible, Keanu's character seems to be a cookie cutter character with a rather two dimension perspective.  Whilst the ending is what all dreamers like you and I are wanting, right in the snowy night in Paris, and that they all live happily ever after, I find it too formulaic and too good to be true.  Still, the journey heading to the final destination is such a joy to watch.  There are elements in this movie that reminds me fondly of \\"The Producers\\" which is now to be converted into a movie medium.  I find the DVD great with two versions of commentary, one with the main cast and the other with the Director and Producer who are covering the dryer and technical aspect of the movie.  The commentary of the cast commenting upon some of their funnier moments in the making of the movie is hillarious and funny for its own sake.  Well, don't miss this one like I did.  Highly recommended.

B000002MK8|5.0|Sometimes performers get so caught up in the studio that they forget their business is to entertain.  Rod Stewart apparently remembers how to entertain well as is proven by this excellent CD recorded back in 1993.  Rod Stewart clearly enjoys himself and the crowd enjoys Rod as he rocks his way through a string of classic songs.<br /><br />The range of songs is quite good.  There is the classic \\"Hot Legs,\\" with Rod Stewart growling his way in a gritty fashion that rarely comes across in the studio.  There is an excellent rendition of \\"Tonight's the Night\\" that feels more honest and sensual than the studio recording.  \\"Handbags and Gladrags\\" shows a poignant side of Rod Stewart.<br /><br />For a change of pace Stewart rocks his way through \\"Cut Across Shorty,\\" an upbeat song that gets everyone moving.  After this song everyone is pumped and Stewart keeps up the pace with another rocker, \\"Every Picture Tells a Story.\\"  The studio version of \\"Maggie May\\" is as good as any studio version is, but the live version here is far superior.  For some reason Rod Stewart comes across better in this live regarding.  If you have ever been a fan of this song you should buy this CD for this song.<br /><br />Remaining consistent with the quality of the other songs is \\"Reason to Believe.\\"  This version is again, in my opinion, better than the studio version.  I think Rod Stewart's voice matches this venue better than a studio.  Or perhaps Rod Stewart's voice has reached the point where he sounds great.<br /><br />\\"People Get Ready\\" has wonderful strings backing Rod Stewart's vocals.  Rod Stewart does justice to Curtis Mayfield's song.  I usually object to the backing vocals in live performances, but the backing vocals on this song are performed well.  The pace remains steady in the love song \\"Have I Told You Lately,\\" yet another winner on this CD.  \\"Tom Traubert's Blues (Waltzing Matilda)\\" is gloriously poignant and can easily affect your mood, and is yet another in a series of mellow songs.  The pace remains slow with the tear-jerker \\"The First Cut Is the Deepest.\\"<br /><br />The pace picks up slightly with \\"Mandolin Wind,\\" particularly as this song gets into the fourth minute, when the speed picks up substantially and Stewart manages a few yells reminiscent of the 1960s.  \\"Highgate Shuffle\\" is a blues song that Stewart and the band have a lot of fun with, as evidenced by the casual style of the song.  I suspect that had they been allowed to go on the song could have been much longer.<br /><br />The CD finishes with \\"Stay with Me\\" and \\"Having a Party.\\"  The former song has dynamic vocals and a fast pace.  The last song is a fun song and though Stewart sounds a little tired at the end, it seems to me that he is enjoying himself.<br /><br />As I have expressed in a number of previous reviews, I am usually not a fan of live albums.  However, with improved technology, the right venue and the right artist, the results can be surprising.  I consider myself a casual fan of Rod Stewart, but this CD is worthy of having in any pop-rock fan's collection.  Rod Stewart sounds very good throughout this CD, and I consider many of these performances to exceed his studio recordings.  Stewart is enthusiastic and animated, and the quality of his voice is perfect for the songs and the environment.  Fans of live pop albums will want this CD.  Fans of Rod Stewart will absolutely require this album.mellow songs.  The pace remains slow with the tear-jerker \\"The First Cut Is the Deepest.\\" <br /> <br />The pace picks up slightly with \\"Mandolin Wind,\\" particularly as this song gets into the fourth minute, when the speed picks up substantially and Stewart manages a few yells reminiscent of the 1960s.  \\"Highgate Shuffle\\" is a blues song that Stewart and the band have a lot of fun with, as evidenced by the casual style of the song.  I suspect that had they been allowed to go on the song could have been much longer. <br /> <br />The CD finishes with \\"Stay with Me\\" and \\"Having a Party.\\"  The former song has dynamic vocals and a fast pace.  The last song is a fun song and though Stewart sounds a little tired at the end, it seems to me that he is enjoying himself. <br /> <br />As I have expressed in a number of previous reviews, I am usually not a fan of live albums.  However, with improved technology, the right venue and the right artist, the results can be surprising.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|This is a great DVD and concert.<br /><br />The songs are performed with great passion and love.<br /><br />Eric has never sounded so good and Ginger Baker was exceptional behind the drums.<br /><br />The only concern was the obviously failing health of Jack Bruce who gave the best performance he could but is not 100% well these days considering the illness he has had.<br /><br />Overall it's a great DVD for anyone who loves a good guitar solo and great Rock and roll power trio's such as Cream.
B0000025HG|5.0|Not many artist have the talent and experience enough to record an album with homogenity such as this interesting and somewhat strange concept album. It does evoke a feeling magical yearning that I myself couldn't explain.    As the title suggests, the album contains songs which have something to do with water. Contrived?Mmmm perhaps but still inventive.    Streisand's voice, as she was in her late 30's was pure and golden (now in her mid 60's is more dark but still powerful) and she sings with a different technique.    I specially loved After the Rain and Kiss Me in the Rain. You definitely will fall in love.So So beautiful.
0060934913|5.0|if you have ever worked in the \\"industry\\" this is a must read but the tv show is kinda lame
B000002KIE|5.0|Yes, the one and only studio album from the pistols. It is brilliant and should be a part of punk rock school 101 for little indie kids who still haven't heard. In terms of power chord rock and roll, this is a kind of throwback to the old days but the spirit is very punk and very british. Speed punk does not apply here. This is pure.
B00007KQKM|4.0|For anyone who has seen the 1981 film adaptation by Just Jaeckin and was dissapointed then this is for you. The 1981 film, I feel, failed to capture the essence of Lady Chatterley's character whilst this version has got it almost perfect. I think the filming and editing in this version far exceeds the film and the acting is a darn sight better. Joely Richardson does the lead justice and Sean Bean (although much better looking that the book describes Mellors but really, who's complaining?) compliments her well. The screen play is faithful considering filming constraints and all together I really enjoyed it. I'm now studying the novel for a university module and this has made me appreciate what is essentially a book/adaptation that pushes class boundaries through the guise of female sexuality. It caused a lot of controversy because of the female lead apparantly being stronger than her husband, taken to extreme in her sexual escapades, rather than being simply an object owned my him. At the trial of the book in the late 1920s the procecutor famously opened with the statement \\"Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?\\" Need he say more? <br />If you do not want to look at the story that deeply then it really doesnt matter, it is a beautifully made adaptation and well worth the 4 hours viewing time.
1594200106|5.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon has written a magnificent novel; one of the finest I have ever read;  a bibliophiles dream. As La Vanguardia wrote: \\"It is a thriller, a historical novel, and a comedy of manners, but above all, the story of a tragic love.\\"<br /><br />A young boy is taken by his bookseller father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, and asked to pick out a title. He must thereafter guard that title against any attempts at destruction. Daniel finds that the book he chooses proves as dangerous to own as it is impossible to forget.  I shall defer to the above eloquent plot synopsis by the Washington Post; let us just summarize that The Shadow of the Wind is impossible to put down. Zafon's intense narrative style is pure magic.<br /><br />There is a reason this book screamed to the bestseller lists and remained there for much more than a year in Spain, Germany, and all of Europe prior to its release in the States.<br /><br />Just get it. Don't hesitate. This one is destined to be a classic for centuries.
B00004URWV|4.0|This album is full of nostalgia if you like 70's synth music. The style is adventuous for the time and naturally slanted at the disco maket which was popular back then. Although many of these tracks may be less familiar to a U.K. buyer, apart from their major U.K. hit 'Magic Fly', for those in the rest of the world and more familiar with their other hits and U.K. buyers who want to hear what they missed out on at the time, this is a good collection to start with and appreciate this under-rated French band who were ahead of their time. <br />
0805076476|5.0|Is it true? Has our society debilitated so far that we require pain, extreme violence and organized mayhem to feel alive? Has political correctness, imposed morality, middleclass convention and excessive consumerism turned most of us into desensitized automatons, pushing endlessly for a better adrenalin rush to experience something meaningful, something with definition, the ultimate sensation?<br /><br />According to the narrator of Fight Club, modern man has failed to grow up, we are merely boys raised by women, and it will take a powerful leader to take us to the heights of manhood never dreamed of before - we've been lied to from the beginning, told that we all can become rock stars, movie moguls and national heroes, when in fact most of us have grown up to pump gas, wait tables, stare at computer screens, work menial jobs for minimum wage and are powerless to do anything about it. We have no control over our lives. The message of Fight Club is clear: it is time to take control, rise up out of our apathetic, consumerist daze, create positive anarchy and start all over again. We desperately need a person like Tyler Durden, Fight Club and Project Mayhem - before it's too late.<br /><br />This has to be one of the darkest most uncomfortable novels that I've read in many years. Palahniuk has touched upon the modern malady, and that is, as a society, we are spiritually deficit, lost in our self-created perfect worlds of Swedish furniture, minimalist apartments, nine to five jobs and the endless stream of reality television. Generally we are lost in a consumerist haze, and it will take someone like Tyler Durden to show us that we have the potential to instigate change within society and ourselves. Men have always beaten each other up for fun and profit. Nothing has changed in this respect. But the notion of an organized underground movement, free of charge, to beat the hell out of strangers in order to feel alive, is certainly original.<br /><br />Palahniuk has a unique voice that is hard edged without sounding like it is trying to be so...the prose is direct and descriptive, boiled down to the irreducible basics, flowing from one hard hitting scene to another, seamlessly. This is good writing, entertaining writing, from an author who feels to me to have his hand on the pulse.<br /><br />This is an excellent novel that actually has something relevant to say. This is cutting satire, black humour with disturbing realism - in my opinion this novel is almost flawless.a unique voice that is hard edged without sounding like it is trying to be so...the prose is direct and descriptive, boiled down to the irreducible basics, flowing from one hard hitting scene to another, seamlessly.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Just when you think that \\"Batjac\\" would never release a widescreen version of this film, here it is and it's dirt cheap as well...the price that is.<br /><br />\\"McLintock\\" is one of the most fondly remembered of John Wayne's films, despite the rather sexist twist and crude stereotype characters that inhabit the movie.  John Wayne is G.W. McLintock, owner of half of Oklahoma (or Arizona, there is no official explaination but the new settlers are referred to as \\"Sooners\\", so I guess it's Oklahoma) must deal with incoming settlers, upset Indians, a befuddled Mayor 'n Governor, a prissy Indian agent, and most importantly his stuck-up wife played by Maureen O' Hara.  Sub-plots abound in this production, but it ultimately comes down to Wayne getting so sick and tired of his wife's attitude that he finally chases her down and spanks her good with a fireplace shovel.  In it's defense, this film is sort of a western remake of Shakespears' \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\", but the lead actors seem about 20 years too old for this to really work.<br /><br />Another annoying aspect is the stereotypical \\"Chinese Cook\\" (H.W. Gim) who speaks in pidgin English and rants on about how miserable his \\"crummy family\\" is. Not to mention the Indian sub-plot which is really too serious for a film like this. Yet, it does effectively lead to the climax of the picture.<br /><br />The film does have some big laughs and what really works is the relaxed pace, allowing us to get to enjoy many of these characters. The entire cast and John Wayne in particular seems to be enjoying themselves a lot.  Wayne has some memorable lines and seems quite comfortible working in a comedy.  Of particular note is his scene with the lovely Yvonne De Carlo where he declares that his tossing his hat onto the weather vane \\"309 times in a row...gotta be a record!\\" is particularly good.<br /><br />There is the famous big fight sequence, complete with a muddy slope which Wayne, O'Hara, & and the rest of the cast take at least one trip down.  As well as some numerous famous lines such as Wayne's \\"Pilgrim\\" speech he gives just before the fight.  But my favorite has to be the one given by bit player \\"Big\\" Jim Hamilton, who declares just after the Indians shoot up the town, \\"Aw folks, we're not gonna let a little old Indian raid ruin a good bar-b-que 'n rodeo, are we?!\\"<br /><br />I found the DVD transfer of the film to be sharp and quite good.  And I cannot say enough about seeing this film in widescreen which makes the experience even more enjoyable.<br /><br />The DVD extras are plentiful and informative.  Particularly the recent interviews with Stephanie Powers and the still-regal Maureen O'Hara (who is closing in on 90 years old).  The \\"2 minute fight school\\" is a rather nice piece from two stuntmen who demonstrate the classic technique used in \\"McLintock\\".  The commentary from Leonard Maltin & Frank Thompson is particularly good, especially when combined with other comments by O'Hara, Powers, & Michael Pate (who played \\"Puma\\"). I do wonder why Jerry Van Dyke was not included as I can't believe he was busy that day...<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD for John Wayne fans and those who want to see the \\"Duke\\" in a more comedic role. So despite some flaws, it gets the highest rating from me and I hope that \\"Batjac\\" will keep producing widescreen DVD versions of the rest of John Wayne's films.e numerous famous lines such as Wayne's \\"Pilgrim\\" speech he gives just before the fight.

B00016POFE|5.0|This was an exceptional CD on its initial release and in DTS, it is positively, jaw dropping amazing. Give Steve Wilson credit for writing songs with a sense of dynamics unparalleled among his peers. The conclusion of this DVD-DTS is the most achingly beautiful conclusion to an album since the final 3 minutes of Yes' TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS. <br />The separation of the musical instruments, the sheer surge and emotional force of the use of silence as well as power, the deft touch of the musicians themselves and the material make this in regular CD format a phenomenal record. In this extended definition version, it simply goes beyond description.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I am a huge Led Zeppelin fan, I listen to them everyday, and own quite a few of their cds.  I'm only 14, and a freshman in High school, and very very lucky that I started listening to Led Zeppelin.  I am very in to classic rock, and hate Green Day so much.  And on a whim, I bought : Early Days, and Latter Days, the best of Led Zeppelin, volume 1&2. Then thats when it all started, my love, then obsession, for the greatest band of all time.  <br /> <br />I recently bought this DVD, and Family Jewels (AC/DC is my second favorite band).  I just have to say that this Led Zeppelin DVD is the best thing I have ever heard/seen in my life.  I love Led Zep, and to all those who think that they aren't any good, then I suppose you probably have never heard any of their songs.  Get rid of all your Green Day cds, Buy Led Zeppelin I, and Highway to Hell - AC/DC.  Then have an open mind about other bands, and get - Boston's Greatest hits, and Young Hearts - Best of the Steve Miller Band, and where would anyone be without Fourty Licks - Best of Rolling Stones?  I have soo many great cds, and none of them are the stupid rap stuff.  They are all classic rock.  And as far as Music DVDs go, I have AC/DC - Live at Donnington, Family Jewels, and this Led Zeppelin one. <br /> <br />So if you ever have liked any type of music ever, this DVD is for you. .  . Well that may be a broad generalization from some people's points of view, but it is true.

B000301YY8|2.0|Well! We all thought Leo had faded away back in the early eighties, after a string of albums and hits over almost ten years. (Go ahead, sing to yourself a few bars of \\"When I Need You\\" . . .) But here he is, back and sounding exactly the same as if it's 1974 all over again. Except . . . . . I remember him as a waif-like short fellow with wiry hair, whose plaintive voice and songs matched his appearance. Somehow, in the intervening years he's managed to completely change his appearance, turning into a ruggedly handsome guy with cool long hair! (Plastic surgery? Even to make him taller?!!) And apparently he's spent those years as a British soldier in the Balkans, and as a guard for the British royal family - or something like that. Amazing! How did li'l Leo do it? (Was it some kind of community service sentence for some ill-doing? Say it ain't so, L-e-o!) Well, who cares? Since he's returned to what's apparently his first love -- singing emotive, drippingly romantic soft-rock in that virtually timeless style that he perfected back in the seventies - and still with that quavering, almost off-key falsetto. So what's next, Leo - err, I mean \\"James\\" (nudge, wink)? A duet with Mariah? Breaking into a rap, or better yet, having a rap star guest on one of his songs? Will this album come out in a new version, remixed for the dance clubs by today's hottest DJ's? Or will it come out later, in a more expensive version, repackaged to include a DVD of Leo/James's videos? Ah, soft-rock fluff-pop . . . . forever bubbling under the trendy styles, never quite making a comeback, but always threatening to . . . and always, always, \\"Giving It All Away\\".
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Aside from the singles released off of Toxicity, I started listening to their first CD, Toxicity, and this album all at the same time. This was after I went to their concert and realized I seriously needed to start listening to them.  <br />  Having listened to their 3 albums in order all at once has given me an interesting perspective on how their music has evolved. Although I like a lot of their first album, much of it is just too hard with not enough melody or musical complexities for my taste. Toxicity was greatly improved in that respect, with songs like chop suey and ariels maintaining the bands ferocity while containing great melodies. It was with Toxicity that I also began to notice and appreciate the rhythmical and sometimes melodical complexities that SOAD incororated into their heavy sound.  <br />  However, w/ Mezmerize this band has taken it's songwriting abilities to a new level. The songs are as heavy and intense as ever, but contain so many great  ideas and awesome melodies and harmonies that it's a consistently entertaining and great listen. Anyone rock fan should like this, but I recommend it to all. Keep an open mind!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|MY GOODNESS!!  This is the best CD I've heard Metheny do!  If I can describe it, take all of his recordings from the last 30 years, put them in a bowl, mix it all together, and you would get this.  A miaculpa of every album he's ever done.  It's almost like listening to a history lesson of his life.  Metheny is a musical genious and this CD is incredible to listen to.  It's his finest work to date!  A modern masterpiece!
B0009P42SC|5.0|Steamboy is no Akira, and for many fans I think this will end up as a crime. Akira was a complex, violent, and disturbing film. Steamboy seems more akin to Walt Disney. Unfortunately for me, I bought this movie expecting Akira and I was obviously disappointed. But then I watched it a second time; I forced myself to, with a mindset that didn't include Akira. I told myself that I've seen and enjoyed anime of this type before (Spirited Away), so it couldn't be all that bad.<br /><br />I was right. The film was excellent the second time (and the first time as well, only I was of the mind to hate it because of it's less-mature themes). In the end, I realized it was actually very close to Akira in that it was a story of a young boy trying to save his family and friends from a technological catastrophe, and has to do all this with very mixed emotions of what is right and wrong (no more spoilers, I promise). When I realized how good this movie actually was, I also realized that, like Akira, it's a groundbreaker. It proves what Studio Ghibli has been attempting to prove on its own: that anime does not have to be violent, strange, or downright macabre to be good.<br /><br />Pick this film up if you want to see a new side to anime. And remember, it's no Akira, Ghost in the Shell, or Ninja Scroll, but it still deserves its name among these anime greats.
B000AMWIVM|1.0|Cary Elwes doesnt even deserve to be making films - this movie was just terrible and I could not believe how bad the acting was.  The concept was good and in better hands - it couldve been an okay film - but in this case a laughable farce that shouldve gone straight to video.  Definitely deserves to be in a list for the top 10 worst films - it would almost be the top of my list.

B000AL730O|4.0|The Good<br /><br />I have to say that I really haven't listened to a Paul McCartney solo album since Give My Regards to Broad Street (and I was 8). Sir Paul starts things off with a simple 1, 2 on \\"Fine Line\\". The driving piano changes and subtle falsettos are sure to draw you in. The lyrics are about returning to the spotlight as a musician. I still can't tell if it's about Paul himself or someone he knows. However, it's not hard to figure out that \\"How Kind of You\\" is a ballad geared solely at McCartney's lady love. \\"At the Mercy\\" is a nice mix of piano driven rhythms and beautiful vocal melodies. The addition of warm strings helps enhance the emotional level.<br /><br />\\"Friends to Go\\" is an acoustic heavy number that builds as it progresses. It explores being in a secret relationship of one that is looked down upon by others. It's quite clever. \\"Too Much Rain\\" uses piano and acoustic guitars to set the background for it's tale of heartbreak and tears. \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is layered with multiple instrumentation and has plenty of emotional peaks and valleys. \\"Promise to You Girl\\" begins as if it's another ballad, but quickly switches to an up-beat, piano driven rocker.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" (lyrically) & \\"English Tea\\" (musically) were just a little too artsy for me.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />I wasn't quite sure how to approach my conclusion, but here's what I've taken away from this record. Paul McCartney's a legend. He's written numerous hit songs over his lifetime, plenty of which everybody knows and loves. After attaining that legendary status, it's tough to write another hit song because all people want to listen to are the classic favorites.<br /><br />Let's not forget about the fans now. Devoted fans will listen and accept any music that comes from their favorite artist, good or bad (collective opinions of course). Although I don't hear any real hits on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard (although \\"Fine Line\\" might cut it) that would bring in any new listeners, I do hear plenty of simple, well-written, and well arranged music that is sure to please his fans. Isn't that what made Paul McCartney a legend anyway?uld bring in any new listeners, I do hear plenty of simple, well-written, and well arranged music that is sure to please his fans.

B0006J28BO|4.0|Let me start off this review by saying the movie itself is a five star treat. I rented, after being on a Miyazaki and Ghibli streak, wanting to see all this Japanese studio had to offer. This one blew me away. It made me renew my love for cats, and I know this is one that my best friend, a feline fanatic himself, will probably be proudly displaying next to his What's Michael? japanese comics. Something the collective asian conscience gives them an affinity for cats, and it helps this movie shine. Anyone who has kids or cat lovers will enjoy this tale, but some may be a little lost. There was a movie before this one called Whisper of The Heart, not translated into english, but it isn't the same storyline, just the same characters, so you wont be missing any info, just dealing with a huge plot. Its worth investing in though.<br /><br />WARNING!: Long Plot Ahead! (You should probably just skip to the end and then watch the movie, but it's here for the confused)<br /><br />School girl Haru has problems. She can't seem to get up on time, make it school, or keep it together in class. She has a crush on the coolest kid in class, but he just got a girlfriend. Her self esteem is way down. On her way home from school, her and her friend observe a cat with a gold chain carrying a package. They watch it look both ways, and cross the street. It's carrying a small package in its mouth, and trips in the street, dropping the little package. They gasp, and Haru rushes into the street. As a truck is about to squish the little cat, she scoops him up with her lacrosse stick (carried home from school) and sweeps him into a bush. Upon landing in the bush alongside, she breaks her stick. The cat gets up, and then stands on it's hindlegs. After brushing himself off, he bows and says 'Thank you for saving my life. I will repay you.' and skitters off. Haru thinks she's crazy. When she tells her mom she replies that she has said the same thing before, that she could talk to cats when she was little. She shrugs it off, and heads to bed. In the night, however, the King of Cats and a procession of cats (including the most hilarious black cats, who have a suit-and-tie pattern in their fur, and are the kings secret service) and walk up to her door. She has snuck down to see the commotion, and the steward for the king speaks. He tells her that the cat she saved was Prince of the Cat Kingdom, and they would repay her starting the next day, handing her a list of the gifts. She sleeps and wakes, thinking it's a dream. But, the scroll remains, and the things start happening from the scroll (a hilarious scene where her friend is at school, knee deep in lacrosse sticks had me laughing for about five minutes). Soon, she is overwhelmed by it all, and the last gift is revealed. She must marry the prince, and go to the cat kingdom to live in their palace! Distraught, she is told by a mysterious voice to find a big white cat, and he will lead her to the Cat Bureau. Once found, big cat Muta leads her to a tiny town, with a tiny cat. This is the cat pictured on the box. He introduces himself as Baron von Gikkingen, but The Baron works fine.(because his creator gave him a ridiculous name). A crow statue named Toto comes to life and Haru finds out that Baron and Toto were both given souls because their creators loved them so much, and started the Buearu with refugee Muta. With that, The Baron agrees to help Haru and visit the Cat Kingdom to talk sense into them. Just in time, because the cat vanguard arrives to take her away. The Bureau pursues, and Muta and Haru are whisked away, with The Baron and Toto in hot pursuit.<br /><br />Whew.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is by director Hiroyuki Morita, his first head directing credit. Most other Ghibli movies had been done by Miyazaki or Takahata, with the major exceotion of 'Whisper of the Heart', a detailed picture about a young writer who meets the Baron and he inspires her. Miyazaki wrote it and boarded it, then passed it toYoshifumi Kondo, who died tragically after the release. So, Miyazaki passed this project (the 'sequel') to Morita. Many on the review boards don't like his style. I think it's grand, a soft and more modern approach for the story of a soft and modern girl thrown into a fantasy world. It's still beautiful and has great art direction throughout. The cats are well done, making me marvel at how they captured so many nuances. In just an hour and almost a half, Morita tells his five hundred page storyboard, with 900 lines of dialouge. And it never gets boring, kids wont be dulled by the dialouge and they'll learn a lesson (it's not just about believing in yourself, it's about loving who you are)<br /><br />The quality of the video is great, not the best of the disney transfers, but its soft lensed look adds instead of subtracts from the story, and the audio is amazing. The score is special, as it contains a complete orchestra, something that Ghibli hadn't done before. The theme song is also unique, as its theme was done by an artist Ayano Tsuji, with just her amazing vocals and a Ukelaili. All of the info on the audio and art can be seen on the Making of featurette.<br /><br />Speaking of:<br /><br />There is a Behind The Microphone featurette, covering the voice cast of the american dubbing. This features stars such as Cary Elwes as the Baron (from Princess Bride), Anne Hathaway as Haru (from the Princess Diaries), Peter Boyle as Muta (the dad from everybody loves raymond), Tim Curry as the King of Cats (from lots of movies) and Andy Richter as Natoru, secretary to the king (from... no one remembers his show). Next is an in depth Making Of featurette, that covers the original, the process of making the movie, scoring it and promoting it. Last, the second disc, which features a Complete Storyboard. It's just the audio from the movie set to these storyboards. It's a treat for art students and superfans, casual observers and families will pass this disc by.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic movie, with a great and deep plot, proving that Ghibli has a bright future even after Takahata and Miyazaki aren't directing their features. Compassionate, creative and cool, Cat lovers and families need this movie!ed it to Yoshifumi Kondo, who died tragically after the release. So, Miyazaki passed this project (the 'sequel') to Morita.

All of the info on the audio and art can be seen on the Making of featurette. <br /> <br />Speaking of: <br />There is a Behind The Microphone featurette, covering the voice cast of the american dubbing. This features stars such as Cary Elwes as the Baron (from Princess Bride), Anne Hathaway as Haru (from the Princess Diaries), Peter Boyle as Muta (the dad from everybody loves raymond), Tim Curry as the King of Cats (from lots of movies) and Andy Richter as Natoru, secretary to the king (from... no one remembers his show). Next is an in depth Making Of featurette, that covers the original, the process of making the movie, scoring it and promoting it. Last, the second disc, which features a Complete Storyboard. It's just the audio from the movie set to these storyboards. It's a treat for art students and superfans, casual observers and families will pass this disc by.  <br /> <br />Overall, a fantastic movie, with a great and deep plot, proving that Ghibli has a bright future even after Takahata and Miyazaki aren't directing their features. Compassionate, creative and cool, Cat lovers and families need this movie!
B000AL730Y|4.0|The Good<br /><br />I have to say that I really haven't listened to a Paul McCartney solo album since Give My Regards to Broad Street (and I was 8). Sir Paul starts things off with a simple 1, 2 on \\"Fine Line\\". The driving piano changes and subtle falsettos are sure to draw you in. The lyrics are about returning to the spotlight as a musician. I still can't tell if it's about Paul himself or someone he knows. However, it's not hard to figure out that \\"How Kind of You\\" is a ballad geared solely at McCartney's lady love. \\"At the Mercy\\" is a nice mix of piano driven rhythms and beautiful vocal melodies. The addition of warm strings helps enhance the emotional level.<br /><br />\\"Friends to Go\\" is an acoustic heavy number that builds as it progresses. It explores being in a secret relationship of one that is looked down upon by others. It's quite clever. \\"Too Much Rain\\" uses piano and acoustic guitars to set the background for it's tale of heartbreak and tears. \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is layered with multiple instrumentation and has plenty of emotional peaks and valleys. \\"Promise to You Girl\\" begins as if it's another ballad, but quickly switches to an up-beat, piano driven rocker.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" (lyrically) & \\"English Tea\\" (musically) were just a little too artsy for me.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />I wasn't quite sure how to approach my conclusion, but here's what I've taken away from this record. Paul McCartney's a legend. He's written numerous hit songs over his lifetime, plenty of which everybody knows and loves. After attaining that legendary status, it's tough to write another hit song because all people want to listen to are the classic favorites.<br /><br />Let's not forget about the fans now. Devoted fans will listen and accept any music that comes from their favorite artist, good or bad (collective opinions of course). Although I don't hear any real hits on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard (although \\"Fine Line\\" might cut it) that would bring in any new listeners, I do hear plenty of simple, well-written, and well arranged music that is sure to please his fans. Isn't that what made Paul McCartney a legend anyway?uld bring in any new listeners, I do hear plenty of simple, well-written, and well arranged music that is sure to please his fans.

B0001XAPY2|4.0|Hayao Miyazaki has many hobbies, and these show up in the long list of themes in his movies.<br /><br />His movies almost always have a strong female lead. This is because he's a feminist. He loves machines, especially airplanes and the entire field of aviation. He loves bizarre and cute creatures, and likes to include tough old men (like himself) as the mentor or teacher. This movie was one written for Miyazaki. He made a movie he wanted to see. In fact, it was originaly written for business men and airplane enthusiasts, as he said in an interview after its release. Yet, because it's such a good story, and the feelings involved are all good ones, all ages love this movie. As I have said, and will, these Disney re-masters (Cat Returns, Nausicaa, Porco) all are a great addition for family, Ghibli fans, or anyone who like animation and great stories.<br /><br />Porco Rosso is the story of Marco, a man changed into a pig by a strange curse after the war. It takes place in the Mediterranian, over the Adriatic Sea, then takes us to Milan in Italy during the 1930's. All of these are beautifully done, so much so that you may just want to visit the ocean. And the period deals with (basically only touches on) the fascism in Italy at the time. But, now that he's a pig, and no longer a soldier (because of the regime), he has become a seaplane bounty hunter, under the name 'Porco Rosso' (thats crimson pig in italian). When the sea pirates he hunts band with a hotshot american pilot named Donald Curtis, Porco and Curtis are more than ready to meet in the sky. After an amazing dogfight sequence with Curtis, Porco's plane needs repairs, so he heads to Milan where his mechanic Piccolo resides. Once there, he meets old man Piccolo's gorgeous granddaughter Fio. She's only 17, and for her first job, she may just have to engineer Porco's entire plane. This is only the first third, and there are so many more points, but the story is never too confusing, or convoluted. Anyone can follow it and it never gets too adult either.<br /><br />The quality is great, anyone who has seen Kiki's Delivery Service or some of the other Ghibli films with the European cityscapes, these are done by the same amazing art director. He has such detail, from the middle of the ocean, to Milan, everything is crisp and well colored. They show up beautifully on this version, and Disney really out did themselves with such a good transfer. They have kept the film intact, but without any pops, jitters, or fuzz. The sound is great, another one with a grand score. If you have surround sound this one is probably the best for effects, plus the orchestral score just pops out, making the flight scenes as moving as the romantic ones.<br /><br />The special features are the standard for these collections, with language options and subtitles, japanese TV trailers and spot, and 2 more familiar featurettes.<br /><br />This time, it's the Behind the Microphone from the other Disney releases, only they seem to cover a lot more of the voice replacement process. It features Michael Keaton of Batman fame as Porco, Susan Egan (meg from hercules) as Gina, Cary Elwes (from Saw) as Curtis, the Mamma Aiuto Boss by Brad Garret from Everybody loves Raymond, David Ogden Stiers as Grandpa Piccolo (he is so many disney voices, and Winchester from the MASH series). One thing it left out was the french dub they did, which featured many famous french actors including Jean Reno as Porco, but maybe they did a PAL version with french features...<br /><br />Second on the featurette list is an interview with the producer, Toshio Suzuki. This is informative and funny, and if you are a Ghibli fan, this is sure to please.(Not as good as the one on Nausicaa though)<br /><br />The second disc rounds out Extras with a Complete Storyboard. Again, this is the audio from the movie to Miyzaki's own drawings and boards. Think audio comic. Not all that grand for specials and that's why it lost a star. In another ten years,the second disc will be bigger I'm sure, and I will not feel so bad about taking a star away. But you just exoect more with two discs, and for such an amazin movie, they should be rolling out lots more red carpet. Overall, a fantastic movie worth buying, and if you don't get any of these Miyazaki movies, try your best to SEE this one. Or, do like me and buy them all....the second disc will be bigger I'm sure, and I will not feel so bad about taking a star away.

0385486804|5.0|Krakauer provides the reader with a well-researched and fairly balanced portrayal of a young Man, Chris McCandless, an experienced outdoorsman, who starved to death in Alaska in an abandoned bus during the winter.  How did McCandless end up in the predicament that led to his death?  Why did he abandon the trappings of society and his education to live in the wild?  Was he a reckless fool or did he have a run of bad luck?<br /><br />Krakauer does his best to fill in the pieces of McCandless's motivations and decisions, by tracing his steps, talking to other people who live close to nature, looking at historical records, interviewing people he know or talked to, and reading his diary and letters.  The reader never gets a definitive answer about McCandless, but they are presented a lot of information to help form their own opinion.  Kakauer's association with the story started as a magazine article, in which he freely admits he unwittingly published some misinformation about the case that made McCandless seem more foolish than he was.<br /><br />In the end, Krakauer states that McCandless was simply born into the wrong century.  A topographic map, a must-have for any Alaskan outdoorsman, would have shown McCandless how to get out safely when he was injured and starving, but he didn't have one.  [p. 174] \\"McCandless yearned to wander unchartered country, to find a blank spot on the map.  In 1992, however, there were no more blank spots on the map--not in Alaska, not anywhere.  But Chris, with his idiosyncratic logic, came up with an elegant solution to the dilemma:  He simply got rid of the map.\\"
0385338686|4.0|The Undomestic Goddess was a very entertaining book with a social message.  The main character is quite likable and the book poses interesting questions about the price that women -- or men -- pay for success in terms of the loss of their free time.<br /><br />It was funny and easy, but parts of the book were implausible or based around clich&eacute;s.  If readers can get past that, it's definitely a book that's worth taking to the beach or on a long bus ride.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald<br /><br />Author of D'Amour Road

1573223026|5.0|This is the second book that I've read by Nick Hornby and I must say that I was really impressed.  The thought of all those suicidal people made me fear that the book was going to be unduly depressing, but that wasn't the case.<br /><br />Hornby managed to explore a delicate topic and to give us interesting psychological and philosophical insights while making the book hysterically funny.  That's hard to do and I was surprised at the number of times that I laughed out loud while reading this heartwarming tale.<br /><br />You don't have to be suicidal to feel overwhelmed by life at times.

B00002EPJH|5.0|An earlier review criticises the recording quality of this album and i would like to explain to the reviewer why it is of low quality. <br /> <br />Jarret recorded this album by himself in his shed, it was not intended for comercial release, it was a gift for his wife. <br /> <br />He recorded it after suffering a stroke and being unable to play the piano for many years, this is why he went back to basics and kept it simple.  <br /> <br />This is one of the most beautiful collections of music ever comitted to CD and the context of the album perpetuates it's beauty. <br /> <br />

B00005JNTX|2.0|The first and most important element of any decent Sci-Fi/Action movie is a good script with strong characterisation, plausible dialogue and a believable motivation behind the lead characters. Without these, the film invariably descends into a campy parody of itself, and that is precisely what's happened here. <br /> <br />It doesn't matter how closely this movie sticks to the comics that spawned it - when you move to a different medium you need to make changes to reflect the move (like the cut-down character backgrounds in the X-Men movies, or the plot tweaking and omission in the Harry Potter series - two extremely successful sci-fi/literary adaptation franchises), and sadly, 'Sin City' seems to think it can get away with having the actors spout the same kinds of dialogue as they do in the comics. <br /> <br />This doesn't work for several reasons. On the printed page, we need to have things spelled out for us that comic art - particularly the kind of comic art contained in the Sin City books, a hugely graphical and stylised look - can't capture. Character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - all of these are things that comics more often than not need to have as printed text, and in the comic book medium, this works. On film, these things - character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - are all possible to achieve with visuals - facial expressions, body language, montage sequences, and so forth. The movie of 'Sin City' has its first major failing, then, in that the characters - grim and gritty men and women of action and consequence - wax lyrical over themselves, their current situations, and their previous histories - until they end up sounding like pedantic Drama majors about to embark on their first audition. The Valkyrie speech? The White Light line? The entire opening monologue? Three of the most horrendous offenders that are so full of their own self-importance that it makes the rest of the script surrounding them pale into mundanity- which isn't too much of a problem since it was all pretty mundane to begin with. <br /> <br />The second problem with 'Sin City' is the amateurish use of spot colours, here and there, to suggest a tie to the excellent style of the comic books. 'Schindler's List' used this ploy to great effect, but sadly, here it just looks overdone. Not that this is a bad idea in theory, but thanks to some pedestrian direction (particularly in the first and second stories) it seems to be there just for the sake of it, as opposed to highlighting anything actually important. Case in point: the blue eyes of the young hooker in the second plot are just annoying because there aren't enough worthwhile close-ups of her face to make the colour stand out. It becomes a mere annoyance noticing these small splashes of colour against, it must be said, an overall rather effective visual style of high-contrast black and white areas.  <br /> <br />Direction is run-of-the-mill action fare. <br /> <br />Performances are forced and difficult, particularly the action movie veterans like Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. It can't be much fun having to deal with such clunky dialogue as this. They do their best but sadly, as is the case with the more traditionally artistic actors like Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro, fail to deliver the mawkish, over-the-top lines with anything other than palpable disbelief. <br /> <br />Two stars for a brave attempt is all I can award this movie, such a potential wasted and with such a horrible, forced script, it's lucky to get even that. Pick up the comics instead, they're far more rewarding and not half as annoying.

B00006AW2M|5.0|I saw the Stones on their current tour and they were excellent as always. However, it's a rock n' roll shame that they never play any cuts fromm Satanic. This album is completely different from the rest of their music, but definitely a classic that certainly deserves some stage time. \\"She's A Rainbow\\" would be a definite plus to their already perfect stage presence.
B00005JNJV|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked this batman, but I grew up watching the original batman. All of this depends on what type of style bat flick you will like. I liked the more creative look at batman as Burton portrayed. This movie had some good action scenes, but if Burton had today's special effects, who knows what he could have created. Nolan did a good job re-telling the tale. He stayed closer to the plot of the comic book. In my opinion,Bale was a close second behind Michael Keaton as the best Batman. he did a good job though! I am looking forward to seeing who portrays the joker in the next Batman. Jack Nicholson will be pretty hard to top  considering he's one of the greatest actors of all time. Overall, if you like a batman closer to the comic books, then buy this movie. I'll buy it because I am a hardcore fan. Michael Caine was great as alfred and Morgan Freeman was good too. but, Katie holmes in my opionion, had no business being in Batman Begins. This movie was good but not excellent. Also, the music score for the original batman was far better then this one. The original music fit batman better then Hanz Zimmer's score. Danny Elfman and Hanz Zimmer are both great composers though.

B000001GGV|5.0|Domenico Scarlatti and Ivo Pogorelich share much in common, even to the kind of upbringing they had.  Both lived in a Mediterranean coastal community that was 'off the beaten path', as it were.  Scarlatti was from Naples (at a time when it was not a major city), and Pogorelich is from Dubrovnik along the Croatian coasts.  Thus it might seem like a natural to have the pairing of Pogorelich playing these pieces by Scarlatti.<br /><br />Domenico Scarlatti was son of Alessandro Scarlatti, also a noted Baroque composer.  Domenico was composer of well over 500 sonatas, most of which were not published in his lifetime.  His career was spent largely in Portugal and Spain, a bit far from the centre of gravity of the Baroque era, and so he is often overlooked; his father's compositions are better known in many ways, also, which adds to his being overshadowed.  However, there is a unique power and vitality to the composition of Domenico, which made his music very popular.  However, according to one commentator, ' The sonatas' technical difficulties have often caused them to be regarded unjustly as mere studies in virtuosity, and modern pianoforte technique owes much to their influence. They display a harmonic audacity, and adventurous use of modulation (changing from one key to another), a freshness and variety of invention and a vigorous intellectuality in thematic and structural terms which belies their \\"popular\\" tone and their apparently careless appearance on the page.'<br /><br />Ivo Pogorelich is a popular musician in the musical sense as well as in the success of his career.  He is also very skilled in interpreting the kind of technical requirements as well as the spirit of the compositions of a composer like Scarlatti.  Pogorelich was educated in Moscow, and won many competitions, but perhaps his elimination in the International Chopin Competition in Warsaw made him most famous (one judge quit in protest that he was eliminated in the third round).  Pogorelich continues to work on behalf of music education, being named a UNESCO ambassador of goodwill for musical enterprises.<br /><br />Pogorelich's playing on this disc is a wonderful performance, technically proficient and energetic in expression.tinues to work on behalf of music education, being named a UNESCO ambassador of goodwill for musical enterprises.   <br /> <br />Pogorelich's playing on this disc is a wonderful performance, technically proficient and energetic in expression.   <br />

Except for one song, all the rest are no shorter than ten minutes and they all are great songs. The production is excellent and if your fan of Opeth's other albums then buying this is a no brainer. My favorite cd by them is still Blackwater Park but this one is still excellent. Be sure to give it a listen.

It isn't true that Clint Eastwood is the Only good song on the album, in my opinion it's all good, Clint Eastwood is just a high point.<br /><br />Please Disregard any 1 star reviews, they obviously have no taste and can't understand how amazing this band is.<br /><br />It's like 21st Century Pink Floyd.

B0002IVN9W|4.0|I bought Funeral on a friend's recommendation, listened to it once, and hated it. I listened to it twice, and tolerated it. I listened to it a third time and loved it. It has been in or near the front of my CD case ever since. <br /> <br />The Arcade Fire seems to take pride in being a band that cannot accurately be compared to anything at all. The instrumentals, the vocals, the name, the cover artwork, all seem to be intentionally as unique as possible. In many cases, this works for the band. Songs like \\"Neighborhoods #3: Power Out\\" and \\"Un Annee Sans Lumiere\\" are indescribable, with lead singer Win Butler wailing out nonsensical lyrics over pounding beats and raw guitar riffs on the former and a more restrained, controlled sound on the latter. <br /> <br />My one complaint with the band is their tendency to overdo it on some songs. Butler's mournful lyrics can get grating after prolonged listening, and the occasional songs in which Butler's wife, Regine Chassagne, is overused, or used in ways not befitting her unique voice mean that I actually have to use my skip button on a few tracks. <br /> <br />That said, the Arcade Fire is one of the most promising bands I've heard in recent months, and I absolutely cannot wait to buy their next album, whenever it may come out. <br /> <br />Amazon offers a free download of \\"Neighborhoods #3: Power Out,\\" one of my favorite songs on the CD. Download it. If you don't like the song, don't buy the CD. If you do, then absolutely buy it. You're in for a treat.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I'll admit, I've always been a Green Day fan. I saw them in concert, bought the CDs, wore the t-shirts. That said, I still found it a bit hard to separate the boys from the oh-so-many other pop-punk-rockers out there, especially in the past year or three. <br /> <br />American Idiot changed all of that. The competition? What competition? With this high-concept, amazingly listenable LP, Green Day has separated itself from the pack, showing that Billie, Tre, and Mike really are the world's biggest punk (well, \\"punk\\") band. There's not a single song on the disc that I dislike, and the nine-minute \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is practically a revelation. It's true, some of the songs don't necessarily make sense, and the supposed grandeur of parts of \\"Homecoming\\" did have me rolling with laughter at their... well, pretention, to be honest, but Green Day deserves a little ego. They're one of the driving forces behind the music industry today, and this album is a blinding example of why. <br /> <br />Buy this album. If you don't have the money, save up, and then buy it. If you're looking for an album full of songs just like the title track, maybe this isn't for you, but if you want to listen to some actual mature punk-rock (and no, that's not an oxymoron anymore), this album is absolutely a necessity.
B000069AUI|3.0|I don't hear that much musically in common with Radiohead (as others have stated). Instead, the comparisons I'd make would be to Travis (the melody and chiming guitar), U2 (the falsetto wails and layered reverb), and a dash here and there of Dave Matthews Band.<br /><br />Virtually every song here possesses a tuneful melody that makes it instantly \\"pretty\\" to the ear and makes you want to sing along. This resulted in 3 hit singles: \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\" and \\"In My Place\\".<br /><br />Where it falls apart at times is the lyrics: Too often Martin seems to have settled for words that are teasingly evocative rather than heart-rattlingly direct, making for songs that \\"sound emotional\\" rather than convey real feeling. (\\"Politik\\",\\"Daylight\\")<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"God put a Smile on Your Face\\" seems a bit at odds with the band's general downcast tone (\\"Don't ever say you're on your way down/when God gave you style and gave you grace/And put a smile upon your face..\\"). In the end, the quiet menace of the guitars keep it from being truly \\"sunny\\". \\"The Scientist\\" is far and away Martin's finest lyrical achievement here as he pines for the lover who's long gone in the face of his dispassionate love. (\\"I was just guessing/At numbers and figures/Pulling your puzzles apart/Questions of science/Science and progress/Do not speak as loud as my heart..Nobody said it was easy/Oh it's such a shame for us to part\\") \\"Clocks\\" gets over largely on its charging euphoria. Its relentless piano arpeggios are the musical equivalent of scaling a mountain: reaching a summit only to find it's just a plateau on the way to the peak. Lyrically, it's a bit facile though. \\"Green Eyes\\" breaks the formula with just a touch of alt-country and a stark sound that suits the gentle ode to Martin's lover.

B0002KVULG|5.0|This Dracula is far from the bloodfest that most modern vampire movies are today. It is also nothing like Bela Lugosi's classic but stereotypical/cardboard portrayal of the Transylvanian Count. Made in 1979, this film stars Frank Lagella as a handsome, sexy and romantic Count who belives he has found his true love and Bride in Kate Nelligan's character, who, seduced by the Count, is willing to give up her blood for him. The music is romantic and moody and the cinematography is brilliant. The use of fog, authentic turn of the century costumes (and automobiles/Model Ts)and the darkness, candles and crumbling castle full of cobwebs is a nice touch. Much of the movie seems surreal and symbolic. A lot of it is covertly sexual. This is probably the best Dracula version out there. He is even less frightening than Hammer's Dracula movies starring Christopher Lee. Fran Lagella is doing a terrific job. Laurence Olivier, in one of his later roles is doing a fine job as Van Helsing. This film strays from the original source of the story- Bram Stroker's novel. For one thing, there is no victimizing going on. Dracula seduces these women. He borders on a kind of spiritual romanticism when he tells Kate Nelligan's character \\"at last you will be flesh of my flesh and blood of my blood\\" which is an actual quote from the Bible - its what Adam said when he first saw Eve. The atmosphere of this film is a combination of Gothic romance and savage vampirism. There is absolutely no flaw in this film scriptwise or direction wise. A must have for fans of the many renditions of Dracula on film.
1400049628|5.0|This book is not only a great conversation piece, but makes the perfect coffee table book, or bathroom book even if you go for that. So basically you *can* read this like a novel or just read parts of it at random and still be entertained over and over again. I would only have been more impressed had it actually been written to look like an actual US Military FM (Field Manual).  <br /> <br />It is well written and the authors perspective is consistant throughout. The subject matter is treated seriously in such a manner that it.. *almost*.. makes you think twice. Its humor that you won't find yourself laughing at, but you will find yourself enjoying.
B00000AFWW|5.0|I really LIKE this album, despite Courtney Love's, um, checkered past.  Her voice sounds better here than on her other work, and the song-writing is good.
B000002UAN|3.0|There are many Beatle fans who highly rate RUBBER SOUL as the best of the Beatle albums. However I can't be quite as enthusiastic as that. To me RS has always sounded somewhat like a stop-gap between HELP a more consistent album, recorded 6 months earlier in 1965, and their masterpiece, REVOLVER, released 8 months later. That doesn't mean to say RS is not up to scratch, because there are some real jewels in here, but there are also a number of mediocre tracks included to make RS only a partly satisfying experience.<br /><br />The opener, 'Drive My Car' is not Lennon/McCartney's strongest start to an album, and just seems to lack something. On previous albums like HELP, AHDN and BFS, there were much stronger opening songs. Likewise, the last track on RS 'Run For Your Life' is Lennon's weakest song here, and instead of RS ending on a high note, it further contributes to the feeling of being let down. Other weak tracks are 'The Word', a monotonous dirge that goes nowhere. 'You won't see me' is just ordinary. 'What Goes On' is a rehash of 'Act Naturally' with Ringo on vocals, similar arrangement and arguably one of the worst Beatle songs. 'I'm Looking Through You' starts promisingly, but the song just peters out at the end of each verse. It just doesn't quite gell. 'Think For Yourself' is one of two George Harrison compositions here, but is the lesser one, although it's passable. However as I mentioned there are some gems included which surpassed just about anything else Lennon/McCartney had written up to then.<br /><br />'Norwegian Wood' is one of Lennon's greatest songs and is highly original in both sound and arrangement. 'Nowhere Man 'is a superb Lennon song, with clever lyrics and warm harmonies 'In My Life' shows Lennon at his most introspective, and one of his best ballads.  McCartney's wistful ballad 'Michelle' is classy and is partly sung in French. On 'Girl' Lennon's vocals come across strongly as does the whole song. And Harrison's other composition, 'If I Needed Someone' was his best to that date, and showed that he could match Lennon/McCartney at their finest. In fact these particular songs are that good that they almost compensate for the poorer material. But unfortunately that's still not quite good enough overall, and makes the album a bit disappointing for me anyway.s his best to that date, and showed that he could match Lennon/McCartney at their finest.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|Cream live in 2005 has to be, even to the most jaded fan of Cream or Clapton in particular,a revelation.The playing on this far exceeds anything one could hope for or expect.The way in which they play together now is far more enjoyable to listen to,than the way in which they use to jam in their heyday.They actually listen to each other and play off of each other in a way that leaves todays jam bands looking pretty amatuer.The emotion and timing Clapton uses in his solos combined with the fluid bass playing by Bruce and the taste of the drum fills by Baker make it hard to pick out just a few moments as highlights.Everyone that plays an instrument, especially guitar players, should own this,not only is it enjoyable as a concert but there is alot to learn from it on a musical level.Take it all in and enjoy,simply spectacular.
B000001FS3|5.0|No need to get all wordy here... The disc is a classic and should have a place in everone's music collection! <br /> <br />Put it right next to the Stones Sticky Fingers CD :^)
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|Like so many other listeners of this CD, I had never heard of Sia until I saw the heartbreaking finale of Six Feet Under on HBO. The musical selection for the ending of this show could not have been more inspired even if it had been written specifically for that sequence. The music was hauntingly beautiful, and a good amount of the rest of the songs on the CD are in the Sarah McLachlan vein, but without the wailing or desperate longingness in the voice. Here, the singer's melancholy is revealed through soft, but clever, lyrics, and a soft, hushed voice that seems to mask a lot of pain, suffering, and trials, but with enough hope and faith that there is still something good to sing about yet. Thankfully this is not a one good song CD, it is mature and confident, and will stand up to multiple plays over the years, I'm sure. <br />Highly recommended as a good chillout album. ;) <br />
0300108834|5.0|Most people know Gombrich through his magnificent \\"The Story of Art,\\" which is simply the best overview of art ever written. Although \\"A Little History of the World\\" is on a much smaller scale, it is just as beautifully crafted. He does a wonderful job of providing a quick and insightful overview of (primarily) Western history. In particular, he transforms history into a compelling story that pulls you along from chapter to chapter. I can think of no better gift to give a young person in this day of sound bites and history-lite. And even though it was written for young people, it provides us older folks with a healthy and enjoyable refresher on where we and our society have come from. I've read several comprehensive world histories (in particular J.M. Roberts classic History of the World) and Gombrich's little book serves as a wonderful complement to such larger and more comprehensive works.
B00005JNTX|2.0|This movie was simply too boring and stuoid to keep watching.  It's basically a darker version of Dick Tracey.<br /><br />Skip this one unless you like the comic books.
B00000I2UC|4.0|I don't know why alot of people crap on this album, it's one of my favorites of theirs. Another record I love is \\"Darklands\\", and while \\"Automatic\\" came afterwards, it's alot more rocking and aggressive. \\"Here Comes Alice\\" is a great opener, and \\"Blues From A Gun\\" was a minor hit I believe. One of their best known songs is \\"Head On\\", and I admit it's probably the cream of what's here. Mellower tracks are \\"Halfway To Crazy\\" and \\"Drop\\", the latter covered by Hope Sandoval on her solo debut. Obviously \\"21 Singles\\" is the best place to start for newcomers, but this is listener friendly as well.
B000AARKOO|4.0|It wasn't Gladiator but it wasn't bad.  It was actually very entertaining, which is the director's intention.  I'm a Medieval History buff myself with particular interest in the Crusades, and I (like some of you) could go on about this film's historical inaccuracies.  But being historically accurate is NOT the director's intention.  Ridley Scott directed a work of fiction, not a documentary.   <br /> <br />As to the film itself, I viewed for what it is and enjoyed it very much.  The climax seige of Jerusalem was very well done; I'll never tire of watching trebuchets in action (especially real ones as opposed to CG ones).  Good movie.
B000002H4Q|4.0|As much love as some of their other albums get, be they genre-defining or just consistently amazing, this might be my personal favorite. And I own them all. \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\" isn't just their longest disc (actually a double LP), it's also their most diverse. Upbeat pop and moody goth are all present here. To start, \\"The Kiss\\" is one of the absolute best non-hit songs they've ever done, and I never tire of it. Three of their biggest 80's songs are also included, \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\", \\"Hot Hot Hot\\", and of course \\"Just Like Heaven\\". However, tracks like \\"Torture\\", \\"How Beautiful You Are\\", and \\"One More Time\\" I love just as much. \\"The Perfect Girl\\" and \\"A Thousand Hours\\" are well worth mention also. In fact, the only negative thing I can say about this disc, is that the song \\"Hey You\\" was omitted for time reasons. It is on the double-record and cassette though. Although I'm sure others have said it before, between the music and even the cover art, I find this album to be \\"Just Like Heaven\\".
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse has a sound unmatched by any band around. I first found them, oddly enough, on an iMac commercial when the Showbiz album first came out. The song Sunburn was played while they showed all the different colored computers floating around the screen. I spent around 7 hours online trying to find out who the band was and where I could hear more. I finally found a file entitled \\"Muse - Sunburn (iMac commercial)\\" so I downloaded it. Luckily it was them, and I've been in love ever since.<br /><br />They seem to have combined a great classical sound I've only heard in Queen, with a great blues sound I've only heard from artists long gone. Most kids are looking for that \\"Emo\\" sound, but there's nothing more emotional than the sound you'll hear from Muse. If you have only heard this album, you know how amazing they are, but at the same time you're ripping yourself off. Both previous albums Showbiz and Origin of Symmetry are fantastic. The maturity of the band is clear on Absolution, however, and the \\"End of the World\\" theme is the perfect medium for a sound like this.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|This is his softer stuff...and so so so beautiful.   <br /> <br />Who has the right to put Neil Young down anyway? It's Neil Young! I think he has earned the right to do whatever he wants...and this album is downright lovely! <br /> <br />
B00003CXDB|5.0|Michael Douglas delivers a dynamite performance here as the ultra-rich, heartless, stop-at-nothing stock broker Gordon Gekko.  Perhaps at the time people thought the Gekko role wasn't suited for Douglas, but in retrospect, it seems like a role that couldn't be more up his alley, and he really goes to town with it.    Charlie Sheen does an excellent job as well playing the role of Bud Fox, a younger stock broker who finds himself drawn like a magnet to Gekko's world... ...at least for a while.  Bud Fox's dad Carl is played by Charlie's real-life dad Martin Sheen, and the conflict of interests that occur between Gekko, his British rival Sir Larry Wildman (played by Terence Stamp), and the two Foxs, provide the movie with a healthy amount of edge-of-your-seat drama.  Daryl Hannah's character is rather secondary, kind of like window dressing, but it works well in that respect and she does get the job done.    Interestingly, the ending of \\"Wall Street\\" has something of an \\"evil will prevail\\" vibe to it which is an unsettling, but chillingly effective way of wrapping up this supremely entertaining 1987 movie.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|Special Features are great, movies are obviously great, and the sketch book inside is awesome too.
B00003CY5J|5.0|Granted, there is a certain sense of deja vu that comes from watching \\"The Score\\".  The De Niro character, Nick Wells, is extremely familiar, like a cross between the roles he played in \\"Midnight Run\\" and \\"Heat\\".  And that's not to mention the whole idea of Nick getting sucked into doing 'one last heist' by his associate partner Max, played by none other than Marlon Brando.    Despite the fact that it's somewhat lacking in originality, \\"The Score\\" makes for a hell of an entertaining movie anyway.  It's extremely suspenseful, thanks to the excellent pacing, and to an engagingly clever twist or two in the story.  De Niro is very much in his element in a role like this, and his performance is typically excellent, including the compelling interplay between him and Brando.  Edward Norton does double duty--he does a spot-on job of portraying a younger hotshot thief named Jack Teller who's out to prove himself; and he also does a mind-blowingly convincing job of portraying a mentally challenged janitor named Brian, used as an alter-ego to help Jack gain entry into the location where the heist will be talking place.  You might expect there to be a ton of violence in a movie like this, but actually, there's not very much at all, and with the suspense level being so high anyway, the effect is refreshing.    Ultimately, \\"The Score\\" is top-notch entertainment that delivers the goods.
0441172717|5.0|But is is what it is. I never liked Science Fiction, and much rather preferred reading Fantasy books. Then I read DUNE. This is the SciFi book for fantasy book fans. It is a great mixture of mysticism and adventure, with a dose of realism blended with high adventure. Frank Herbert truly created a masterpiece with DUNE, a storyline with deep characters and intriguing plot. It is a balance of all the things I love about reading books, and it's a fun read because of it.
B000793BAU|5.0|Paying homage to the Nat Cole Trio, the most popular jazz combo of its day, Diana Krall (piano), Russell Malone (guitar), and Paul Keller (bass) bring some long-time favorites and some lesser known Cole Trio hits to life. The arrangements are terrific, ranging from slow, bluesy numbers, to swing, a torchy ballad, and forties-style jive. In every case, the emphasis is on the trio, and though Krall sings on every track, more than half of each song is instrumental, with extended solos on piano by Krall and guitar by Russell Malone.<br /><br />Krall's voice is a full, sometimes husky, alto with very little vibrato, and though she can sing scat, and does on \\"Frim Fram Sauce,\\" she is at her best singing slow songs of aching loss, where, occasionally, her phrasing reminds me of Sarah Vaughan. \\"Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You,\\" sung slower than Cole did it, is a sad, bluesy number with wonderful, casual jazz piano riffs. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" my favorite on the album, is torchy, the imagined tears kept under control as Krall pines for lost love, with the piano ranging into chromatic variations. In \\"You Call It Madness\\" and \\"I'm Through With Love,\\" Krall keeps her voice whispery, singing slowly, almost confidentially, as she maintains the slow beat and melancholy mood. By contrast, \\"Hit That Jive, Jack,\\" moves in a quick, toe-tapping rhythm, as Krall, Malone, and Keller sing together and have fun.<br /><br />The album has plenty of variety to the selections and features three fine jazz instrumentalists who toured together and perfected their ensemble for several months before recording this album. With the earthy voice of Krall added to the instrumental mix, this album is certainly one of Krall's best--a huge success. There are no drums here (except on \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\"), but that is not a limitation, and, in fact, may be an advantage, since the listener's attention remains focused on the tunefulness of the songs and their jazz variations. This is a fine homage to the Nat Cole Trio, which would have been justly proud of Krall's recording. Mary Whippleine homage to the Nat Cole Trio, which would have been justly proud of Krall's recording. Mary Whipple <br />
0307276902|5.0|I read this book in two days...couldn't put it down.  I loved the writing style.  Never mind some customers griping about Burrough's, et. al.....this is an addiction memoir for the 2000's.  Language is a living thing and as such it evolves.  This is evident in Frey's language.  I have no personal experience with addiction, but I felt compassion and sorrow and hope for James and the friends he made in rehab.  Great job.

1896597890|5.0|The hauntingly sparse artwork is matched by a near-perfect economy of words -- there is not one wasted panel in the whole of this book.  Delisle's observations are sharp and pointed, but never confrontational.  This is an easy book to read in one sitting because it is a difficult book to tear yourself away from.  An absolute must-read.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|Being an 'old fogie' of 58, I find it harder and hard to find movies that don't offend my sensibilities.  My husband and I caught this on cable and liked it so well, I ordered it right away.  For me, it is right up there with 'The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain', 'Foul Play', and 'The Accidental Tourist'.  I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate great dancing and a quirky plot.  What is true of dancing in this case is also true of life.........
B00005JKCH|5.0|Dear Fellow Spidey-Fans,  <br /> <br />As a young boy, I always imagined the fun I would have if I had the abilities and commensurate strength of a spider, so in college I studied genetics and biochemistry in the hopes that one day I would have the skill to transfer the powers of a spider to myself. Unfortunately, I had to find work quickly to support my young family and took up a job selling insurance, but in my spare time I set up a molecular genetics and biochemistry lab in my garage. <br /> <br />Thinking back on my youthful fantasies, I created a mutated strain of spider having all the abilities mentioned in the movie. I then infected the spider with a virus that incorporated the spider's genome into the virus's own DNA.  <br /> <br />Much like in the movie, I allowed the spider to bite me and inject the virus into my bloodstream, and also paralleling the movie, I felt woozy and collapsed to the floor. When I woke up later the next morning, I looked in the mirror with high hopes, but found my vision was distorted. On closer inspection, I realized that my vision was distorted because I had grown six extra eyelets, like a real spider. At first, I was horrified, but then I gradually came to accept the change as the price of greatness. But that was not the end to the transformations.  <br /> <br />I too, can spin a web, but it doesn't shoot out of my wrists. Instead, like a real spider, my spinnerets are located in my anus, so I have to pull down my pants every time I want to create a web.  <br /> <br />I also have a deep craving for the blood of insects, and my family has left me because my favorite food are live flies I catch with my web.  I eat them as a real spider would, by injecting my venom and digestive enzymes into their bodies to liquefy their innards and then sucking out the deliciously bitter and creamy soup. <br /> <br />Anyway, I wanted to warn all you spidey-fans out there who are thinking of allowing yourselves to be bitten by genetically-modified super spiders that you may get more than you bargain for. I no longer resemble anything human, and soon I will need to banish myself from human society for the sake of all that is good and holy. Please take heed, fellow spidey-enthusiasts, of my tale of Faustian woe. <br /> <br />Your arachnoidal friend
B00028HBKM|1.0|Curiosity got the better of me and I had to go see this film; unfortunately it was a disappointment & quite confounding.<br /><br />It focused overwhelmingly on the torture & crucifixion that Jesus experienced, but so little on the positive messages he preached.<br /><br />Can someone explain why this torture is so important?  Granted, it was awful and the movie does do a wonderful job of portraying the gore.  Although, I still do not know what value this has?  There were many others then who experienced the same thing, as there are many today who experience equally gruesome torture (even including people who have stood for justice & righteousness - just as Jesus did...but should this even be a requirement for humane treatment?).<br /><br />Summary: Too much painful imagery; not enough of the beatitudes
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|it would be downright moronic to pretend that pop-punk hasn't made a huge comeback since the late 90's and early 00's. for a while, it seemed as if all the mainstream acts who started out doing pop-punk had totally changed, becoming either more hardcore or experimental. however, pop-punk has always had a strong following in the underground indie scene, and with the recent success of bands like Fall out boy and my chemical romance, it seems as if pop infused punk rock has found it's way back into the hearts of the mainstream, reinvented of course. in this day and age, it's a race to see which pop-punk band can become the \\"be all\\" for it's second wave. paramore is clearly in this race. their angle you ask? they're a post-punk act, with the occasional screaming and breakdowns, fronted by a young female vocalist. at the surface, it doesn't sound like much, but after a couple listens, you start to get it.  <br /> <br />Lyrically, paramore is pretty good, with concepts that are neither too shallow, nor to complex to grasp.  <br /> <br />Musically, it's pretty much the same, nothing too out there, but nothing tired or stale either.  <br /> <br />\\"all we know is falling\\" isn't perfect, and because paramore's members are all really, REALLY young (15-18), minor flaws are apparent in a good majority of the songs. at the end of the day, it's hard to say where paramore will end up in 3 or 4 years, but for now, \\"All we know is falling\\" is a great addition to any pop/punk/rock collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly has an intriguing plot, realistic characters, and witty comments that keep you glued.  There are no perfect, idealistic characters in Whedon's universe.  They are people trying to scrape by with good and bad qualities who learn and change throughout the show, making them sympathetic and realistic. Joss Whedon's writing resembles Buffy in the fact that the show cannot be seen out of sequence without you missing something, usually involving the evolution of the characters, but it is not fair to compare it to Buffy/Angel.  This is a new universe.  As Star Trek was supposed to be a Sci Fi Western, concealing the Western aspect, Whedon does the same, but unabashedly flaunts this \\"New Frontier\\" with horses and cattle.  The result is a show that appeals to a wide range of viewers of all ages.  Sci Fi lovers, Western lovers, and many in between. I know very few people that  have been introduced to Firefly that were not hooked after the first episode, which did not air until it was canceled.
1400049628|2.0|I thought the book would be rather humorous considering the fact that it is classified as \\"humor\\" but the author writes almost in a technical sense as though zombies actually exist. Therein lies the \\"humor\\" I suppose, but I was still disappointed.
B000286RNY|5.0|Director-star Stephen Chow is one of the most refreshingly original artists in film today between his work here and in \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\".  He borrows from American films as well as Eastern cinema but adds enough of his own unique touches to distinguish himself from other filmmakers.  The film carries on the tradition of great sports films like \\"Rocky\\" and \\"The Bad News Bears\\" but adds martial arts into the mix.  There's also a touching love story here that doesn't bog down the proceedings.  Chow is a greatly imaginative visualist and the film contains any number of hilarious sight gags.  Chow also provides great verbal dialogue if the subtitles can be trusted.  I didn't see this film on it's initial run because I found soccer as much of an anethma as baseball is to overseas audiences.  Don't let that be a turn-off because this movie is alot of fun.

0895260131|5.0|The truth shall set you free. From what college and my pro's has told me that Islam is a peace loving religion. Yeah ok! I've read the Koran, read alot and wrote essays on the compare and contrast of the crusades and Islamic history in general, and still felt that Islam was a violent religion. Most people forget that the Muslims attacked Europe first before the crusades. But that is the norm nowdays that the Christians are bad becouse of the crusades among other things. Don't get me wrong I don't believe two wrongs make a right but when Islam thought it could invade Europe and conquer them, what does one expect? For the European nations to not fight back? That is the funny thing about Islam is they attack nations around them not thinking that they are going to get attacked themselfs. Anyways it was a good book worth the read if you agree or not.
B000065VA1|5.0|When I listened to \\"Sledgehammer\\" for the first time few years ago, it was doubtless the huge title of Peter Gabriel. <br />The mix is both new and exciting, and these are the qualities to be a great hit.
B0002DB52M|5.0|The movie was a tad bit too long - just a tad.<br /><br />With that stated, the acting is phenomenal. There are no special effects to liven things up. There really isn't any set to speak of. This is a film that is firmly centered on the script, the ideas, and the actors' abilities to convey the words and thoughts. The rest is up to the viewer.<br /><br />Dogville has my mind spinning. It forces you to confront some seemingly simple ideas. The one concept that has me all conflicted is: arrogance vs. forgiveness. Everyone will walk away with a variety of issues to discuss with others. And, I would imagine that some of these conversation will be rather heated.<br /><br />Dogville isn't entertaining. This isn't a movie to watch if you just want to flake out. There are many powerful scenes and a tremendous amount of dialogue that will keep you engaged. Just make sure you're in the mood for almost three hours of thought.

0743219619|4.0|As always, P.D. James has crafted a story that not only works as a mystery, but at a much deeper psychological level.  \\"The Black Tower\\" may be the most diverse of the offerings in the Adam Dalgliesh saga simply due to its plot.  The beloved detective finds himself on the sideline in this novel, leaving the readers to wander and wonder through much of the story before the resolution is given.  It also doesn't help matters that throughout much of the novel Dalgliesh has resolved himself to not being a detective ever again.<br /><br />Recovering from a sickness (or perhaps near-death experience), Dalgliesh reluctantly takes up an invitation from an old family friend to visit at Toynton Grange, a home for the terminally ill.  Yet upon his arrival, Dalgliesh discovers that his family friend, Father Baddeley, passed away nearly two weeks prior to his visit.  And despite his desire to quit his job, his detective instincts go into suspicion overload when he looks into the happenings at the home; there was a suspicious suicide and more strange deaths to follow.  Surely there must be more to the story than what is being put forward, but still weak and beleagured, Dalgliesh cannot put his finger on what it is.<br /><br />\\"The Black Tower\\" was perhaps the most difficult read I've had so far from P.D. James.  While it is a finally crafted story, it lacks the quick pace that most of her mysteries have.  The reader is left in the dark just as Dalgliesh is, and when the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, there seem to be too few substantial clues to make the connections, only mere speculations that the reader may have missed.  Also, the tone of 'The Black Tower\\" is much darker than some of James' other pieces, adding to the slow pace and fatigue almost that overtakes the reader as they try to figure out the mystery.
1559409002|5.0|Producer/director Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962) is a brilliant and scary nightmare with an eerie organ score by Gene Moore and magnificent B&W photography by Maurice Prather.  Like a nightmare, it is a movie filled with eerie images and phantom characters who cannot be explained.  Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) survives a drag racing car crash in Lawrence, Kansas, then takes a job as a church organist.  She keeps seeing a pasty-faced ghoul in her rooming house that fellow boarder John Linden (Sidney Berger) does not see.  In a movie partly filmed in Lawrence and partly in Salt Lake City, Mary  finds herself drawn to the abandoned Saltair Pavillion amusement park on the salt flats.  A dream sequence-actually several sequences-has Mary present but neither seen nor heard in a department store and inside a bus depot.  But a bus is filled with ghouls for Mary, again a nightmare.  CARNIVAL OF SOULS climaxes with a terrifying and memorable dance macabre, with all of the ghouls dancing at Saltair's merry-go-round at night and Gene Moore's unforgettable organ music going nuts.  Is Mary Henry alive or also a phantom figure?  Did she really survive the car crash?  Who is The Man, as the head phantom ghoul is termed?  Harvey told a screening audience that there are a lot of things that happen at night, but cannot be explained in the light of day.  He was after \\"the look of a [Ingmar]  Bergman and the feel of a [Jean] Cocteau.\\"  I have never seen a Cocteau movie; he made dream-like fairy tales.  And the film certainly does evoke the harsh B&W lighting and allegorical plots of Bergman. <br /> <br />I am reviewing the labor of love two disk Criterion DVD edition of CARNIVAL OF SOULS.  Disk one has a curious presentation of the edited version of the movie, running 78 minutes.  It played on the Deep South drive-in circuit in 1962, financed by a company (Herz-Lions) that went bankrupt.  Disk two has a restored and remastered 35mm print of the 83 minute Director's Cut, with very insightful commentary by producer/director Harvey and writer John Clifford.  The two men both worked for Centron Films in Lawrence, Kansas.  Raising $13,000 from local businesses in one weekend (!), Harvey shot his movie during a three week job hiatus with a drama student cast and a crew of six on location in Lawrence and at the Saltair Pavillion outside Salt Lake City.  The rest of the cast were local extras, approached by Harvey with a chat like, \\"For $25 and an hour or so, can we borrow your store to make a movie?  You are the store manager and this actress here (Hilligoss) is unseen by you?\\"  He would approach strangers all over Lawrence and ask them if they would like to be in one scene of a movie playing themselves or a phantom ghoul for free or small change.  The town had fun! <br /> <br /> In the end, CARNIVAL OF SOULS got made for $13,000-plus $12 to pull a car out of a river and fix a broken fence.  But in 1962 no distributor knew what to do with an 80 minute B&W art film made in America, not Europe.  The movie was recut and booked, as I said above, on the southern drive-in circuit with something called THE DEVIL'S MESSENGER.  CARNIVAL faded fast from memory, without ever playing a walk-in theatrical engagement in the rest of the country.  But then something strange and wonderful happened.  CARNIVAL became a word-of-mouth cult classic from late night TV showings during the 1970's.  Fantasy and horror magazines wrote about it, film festivals begged to show it, and Siskel and Ebert reviewed it on TV.  Finally, in 1989, Herk Harvey, John Irving, and surviving cast members gathered in Lawrence's movie theater for a screening of the uncut movie.  This is all documented on disk two of this lovely Criterion set. <br /> <br />Ironically, as revealed on disk two, CARNIVAL OF SOULS was just one three-week gig for a writer (Clifford) and director (Harvey) who took a leave of absence from their jobs to make it.  Then Harvey edited the resulting movie after hours at Centron Films, where he and Clifford both worked.  Actually, Harvey joined Centron in 1947 and Clifford joined in 1960.  Harvey made a staggering 400 industrial and educational shorts over 35 years.  A slide presentation by Ken Smith, called CENTRON: HOLLYWOOD IN A LIKEABLE TOWN, documents the history of Centron and shows us five of the 400 films.  They range from job safety to juvenile delinquency to travelogues to personal hygiene.  During the 1950s and 1960s, Centron was a giant in producing short films for schools and businesses.  But Centron was slowly allowed to die in the mid 1970s after a company called Coronet bought them out to acquire a backlog of educational films. <br /> <br />Disk one for CARNIVAL OF SOULS takes us on a \\"then and now\\" tour of Lawrence and Saltair, and also gives us at least half an hour of Gene Moore's ghostly organ music over film outtakes.  In the end, we cut back to Harvey (who died in 1996) and Clifford (seemingly still alive).  \\"It's nice to think our movie has that much hidden meaning and complexity.  What was our intention for this or that scene?  You are talking to two guys who can't  remember what they were doing last week.\\"  CARNIVAL OF SOULS is a masterpiece of the macabre, a real twilight zone nightmare, and certainly a must-see at Halloween season.  And Criterion, which admittedly is charging a lot more than other companies, has the finest print plus tons of interesting  bonus material.  If you want to own the definitive DVD edition, you want the Criterion edition. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JO0J|4.0|\\"Serenity\\" is one of the most enjoyable genre movies I've seen in a while: exciting, original, funny (very, VERY funny), yet very believable and HUMAN. THIS is what science fiction is all about, George Lucas, not the garbage that made up the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels. The movie sagged a bit in the middle (hence the missing star in the review), but the rest of the film more than made up for it. I have yet to see \\"Firefly,\\" but if it's anywhere as good as \\"Serenity,\\" sign me up for the DVD!
B000B0WODA|4.0|The main knock I have with Franz Ferdinand's debut was that though every song was catchy and had foot tapping moments, the tempo of all the songs was the same. There were no slower songs thrown into the mix(you can make a case for Auf Acshe) to switch things up or calm down your beating heart. With 'You Could Have It So Much Better' they remedy this problem and that's a big bonus.    Particularly with the slower songs Eleanor Put Your Boots On and Fade Together you see another side of Franz(and one that sounds a bit Beatles-esque no less). These two songs are placed at good points in the album but that weakness still sneaks up a bit. All of the songs pretty much have a catchy beat and it's rarely repetitive. The things that seems to drag a bit is the amount of up tempo songs. This album is only 41 minutes long but it seems to go on longer because of that similarity between some songs.    The first single, Do You Want To, is the best song they've done IMO. Even though it has the same formula as Take Me Out it just has a catchier beat and really gets me moving. It's also the only song that would seem to belong on FF's debut. Other strong songs are The Fallen(one of the best and most unique of theirs), This Boy, Evil And A Heathen, I'm Your Villian, and Outsiders. As you can see, I find the beginning of the album to be really song with it kind of running together during the middle to end. Outsiders is a great way to end the album though, as it's a rather unique song with some of the effects and the overall feel of it.    The bottom line here is if you liked their debut you should love this effort. It's the same Franz you know and love but with some new twists and many new catchy tunes. If you weren't much of a Franz fan but like these retro bands then you still might want to check this out, there's a better amount of variety(though more is still needed). I look forward to seeing where they go from here.

His music, energy, and rapport with the audience is truly amazing.  He puts his heart and soul into each and every song.

B00005JNJV|5.0|In 1989 the long awaited film debut of the Dark Knight, BATMAN, was released. The movie was directed by Tim Burton and Burton, with his child-like imagination, gave the world a BATMAN movie that was worth waiting for. Despite the \\"controversy\\" about the nipples on the Batsuit and the casting of Michael Keaton as Batman, Burton's BATMAN has remained as the best of all Batman films and one of the better film adaptations of a comic book. As brilliant as Burton's film was, in his own way he began the downfall of the franchise with BATMAN RETURNS. That movie, like the first was rather dark and sinister, but too much so and the characterizations which had developed in the original were thrown by the wayside in favor of a macabre worldview. After Burton gave up directing the franchise, things went totally downhill, first with BATMAN FOREVER and then with the cartoonish romp, BATMAN AND ROBIN (the Batman tv series was better than that).  Warner Brothers was in deep trouble and with a flagship franchise on the verge of completing sinking, they got serious and took help from those who knew best.<br /><br />After years of entaglement, rewrites, changes in directors, etc. BATMAN BEGINS arrived. It was worth the wait.<br /><br />BATMAN BEGINS revises the original Batman films. Christopher Nolan and company probably knew there was no point in trying to continue the series (and there was no way to salvage anything from the last two films in the series), so pulling their own \\"DC revision\\" they rewrote Batman's origins.  Batman doesn't even appear on camera until about 1/2-2/3rds of the way through the film. Instead, the audience is presented with the struggles of Bruce Wayne.  His fall down into a cave where hundreds of bats swarmed around him, the callous murder of his parents (sadly the Zorro reference has been altered in the film), his aimless wanderings around the world to discover his identity are all explored. These experiences make Bruce Wayne the man he is and in turn, allow him to become the Dark Knight.<br /><br />Those who are more inclined for an action-filled picture will abhor the first 1/2 of the movie. However, it is essential to the plot and makes the characters on screen much more believable and realistic.  However, once Batman shows up, the action quickly picks up until a dramatic showdown on a runaway train.<br /><br />For a picture based upon a comic book, the acting is superb.  But of course with a cast that includes two Oscar-winners and a few more nominees, one shouldn't expect less. Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman is the best person in the role to date--he fits both as Bruce Wayne and as Batman.  Michael Caine is a wonderful Alfred, Morgan Freeman is perfect portraying Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman (one of the most underrated actors today) does a remarkable job of pulling off a young Jim Gordon. Katie Holmes looks beautiful, but despite the working-class roots of her character comes off as little more than a piece of eye-candy. Unlike Man of Steel, Batman is a knight, and a true knight can never be with the lady he loves.<br /><br />All in all, BATMAN BEGINS is a great action movie and the best Batman picture since Burton's 1989 adaptation.allow him to become the Dark Knight. <br /> <br />Those who are more inclined for an action-filled picture will abhor the first 1/2 of the movie.

B0002XH9Z4|4.0|As everybody has noticed, Michael has released a number of greatest hits albums (and video sets) that lack completeness.  Each one has a couple of hit tracks missing, replaced by a couple of new tracks that force you to buy each album to complete your collection. <br /> <br />As great as this collection is, sadly it's no different.  New tracks like \\"The Way You Love me\\" and \\"We've Had Enough\\" are wonderful, but leave that \\"why did I buy an entire set for this\\" taste in your mouth.  Other hit tracks are sometimes replaced by early demos, or remixes that take from the nostalgic value this this album could be.  Disappointingly, \\"Heal the World\\" didn't make it on this disc set. <br /> <br />On the contrary, hard-core fans will find everything they're looking for and more.  The rare demos and remixes will complete an already established collection for heavy MJ fans.  Tracks like \\"We Are Here to Change the World\\" (from Captain EO at Disneyland) previously existed as poor quality bootlegs.  For people looking for these extra gems, here they are.  The tracks from The Jackson 5 and The Jacksons are also a wonderful addition for those who enjoy the earlier years. <br /> <br />The booklet included is very nice and has a good amount of content in it. <br /> <br />The included DVD of the Dangerous tour in Bucharest is definitely...interesting...lots of fan shots, but also an opportunity to see the man in his prime, live in action.  Again, if you are looking for that collector's item, here it is.  But nostalgia-wise, this is no comparison to the amazing amount of time invested in his music videos.  Remembering Michael Jackson's unique moves through his well directed and choreographed videos may disappoint when viewing the Bucharest show.  While the man can dance like no other, you simply can't expect him to keep his repertoire of moves fresh through the entire live show.  After a while you start to see a definite repetition that live show recordings exhibit. <br /> <br />The boxset case is actually a tri-fold out book.  It's very nice, but it is white...which picks up a lot of scuffs easily.  Take this into consideration for purchasing online. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a wonderful final puzzle piece for those who have established collections.  However if you are looking to build a collection, you may be better off purchasing his individual albums before thinking about this set. <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I heard Amy Lee's voice...wow.  I only had to hear the one song and I knew I had to have this cd.   <br /> <br />p.s. my boyfriend is always stealing it from me!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I would like to say that I hated the film Monster.  You are probably wondering what that has to do with the film The Machinist?  Let me tell you.  In Monster, Charlize Theron goes \\"ugly\\" in attempt to capture the character that she is trying to portray.  She wins an Oscar, not because her acting was good, but because people could not believe that was Theron so \\"ugly\\".  From that point on I was a strong believer that you could dress up the actor all you want, but deep inside it is still the same actor.  Charlize Theron ugly is still Charlize Theron.  So, needless to say, I was skeptical at first to see how Christian Bale would do with dropping 65 pounds to play the role of Trevor Reznik, an insomniac factory worker with a forgotten secret.  Was it going to be like Monster and spend two hours watching Christian Bale play a skinny Christian Bale?  I my utter surprise, it was not.  Bale, by dropping the weight, accomplished what so many \\"physical\\" actors can only dream about.  He gave depth, a physical persona, and a very frightening image to this character that took us away from Bale the actor.  Throughout the entire film, I could only see Trevor Reznik.  Perhaps it was a trick.  Perhaps Bale couldn't do the character otherwise, but for me, a viewer of the film, it helped create the dark ambiance that shook me to the core until the very end.<br /><br />My first applaud goes to director Brad Anderson for his simplistic, yet chaotic filming of this story.  Throughout the entire viewing, you are given this impression that something is going over your head.  You know that you are missing something and that the ending will shock and amaze you.  For anyone that has grown up in the Usual Suspects or Sixth Sense era, you can smell this film coming from a mile away, but it is the way that Anderson provides the story to you that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  After a vast array of \\"shock-ending\\" films, it is hard to come up with a new, original, and tactful idea that will keep audiences talking long after the credits roll.  Anderson has done a brave new job with The Machinist in providing that chatter after the film.  He showed us his darker side in Session 9 and he doesn't go too commercial in this film.  It is haunting, riveting, and challenging all at the same time ... to say that about a director's work is rare today.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Jennifer Jason Leigh again gives us the beauty of grime and the ability to transform this very small character into a powerhouse role.  She gives so much emotion and humility to her character, which makes you forget (or perhaps not notice) what her true \\"profession\\" is.  There are also so many secrets about her that you cannot help but sit around after the film and think of her story outside of how she reacts with Reznik.  I don't know if anyone else did this, but I couldn't keep her out of my mind.  She was amazing.  Then you have John Sharian playing the polar opposite of Bale in such a frightening way that he nearly steals every scene away from Bale.  He is huge, bulky, and rather transfixing as perhaps the living conscious of Bale.  Following Leigh's feminine role is that of Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n playing Marie.  This very unknown character that seems to be the only smiling face in the film.  She gives comfort to not only Reznik, but also to us.  She is our guiding light at the end of this dark tunnel that surprises you to the very end.  Then you have everyone that is around Reznik like his co-workers, his landlady, and even himself.  A powerful cast that is accentuated with a bold and original story.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that outside of the talented acting and bold direction, you actually have an amazing story.  I know I have mentioned this several times, but you cannot walk away from this story without discussing it thoroughly with friends and family afterwards.  It is like a cinematic drug that you cannot get enough of.  Ithought that with my second viewing that I would have already seen all that I could, but instead I was provided with moments, mere glimpses of truth, that I just completely missed during the first viewing.  It was inspirational to see such dark, yet powerful storytelling to come from a nearly recycled Hollywood.  Sure, there are elements of Fight Club, Sixth Sense, and Usual Suspects all mixed into this film, but Anderson gives it his own flare.  Bale goes to a new extreme proving that he can manage both big box office hits, and these itty-bitty gems.  The Machinist is a refreshing moment for both you and your DVD player.<br /><br />Overall, I really thought this was one of the most powerful films to come out of Hollywood this year.  I would love to see Bale take home a golden statue for his portrayal in this film, but I noticed that Charlize Theron is going to be \\"ugly\\" again in North Country, so I think he will be passed up again.  Bale is becoming such a strong actor because he is constantly working with the quintessential directors in Hollywood.  Not the Bruckheimers, not the Bays, but with these smaller directors that are not afraid to take a leap of faith with Bale.  I have not been disappointed with his work, and I think all that watch this film are going to walk away and see Bale as more than just the \\"man in a bat suit\\", but instead a strong voiced actor that can tackle any role.<br /><br />Grade:  ***** out of *****ht that with my second viewing that I would have already seen all that I could, but instead I was provided with moments, mere glimpses of truth, that I just completely missed during the first viewing.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie surpasses the hype, and infact, blows it far, far away.    The only reason not to see this, is because if you're not an avid fan of Final Fantasy VII, and haven't played nor beaten it completely through, then you will NOT understand the storyline of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, at all.    That set aside, this is a really...really...extremely...good movie. The plot is as follows (for those whom just don't understand it):    The movie is about a disease called Geostigma in which a major portion of the movies setting town Edge, contracts. The movie (for the most part) is about Cloud (the movies hero) trying to rid Edge (not Midgar!) of Geostigma, and save the world from Kadaj, Yazoo, and Loz. Whom are three guys, whom look like Sephiroth...sorta. They're basically Sephiroth wannabes and or clones. Anyway, they're trying to bring about the second \\"Reunion\\" with the remains of Jenova, in which only players of the original FF7 game, will understand what are. But the basis of this second \\"Reunion\\" is to rebirth Sephiroth. An ex Soldier member, gone mad. He was the final boss of the FF7 game. And they're trying to bring him back. And that's pretty much it, right there. I'll sum it up in order, to be understood easier.    -Edge has the Geostigma disease.  -Yazoo, Loz, and Kadaj want to recarnate Sephiroth through a second Reunion using the remains of Jenova.  -Cloud must stop the 3, prevent the return of Sephiroth, and cure Edge of Geostigma before the movies end. All while grieving over the loss of Aeris (a character whom died in the FF7 game).    That's the plot. Yes, the movie DOES have a plot. It just isn't very aparent to those whom haven't played and beaten the game. But it DOES have a plot, and the plot is exactly what I just noted above.    At any rate, the graphics in this movie are off the wall. They look extremely real and less \\"created\\" for a CGI movie, unlike the graphics of the previous CGI Final Fantasy film, \\"Spirits Within.\\" The action is intense as well, and nothing is out of place, looks stupid, or seems like it was put in as filler. There are a few \\"bullet time\\" scenes in there, but those are absolutely necessary, and add to the thrill of the movie.    Nothing about this movie really turned me off, nor made me wanna skip through parts, and that's saying ALOT about it. Considering the last Final Fantasy movie was absolutely HORRIBLE. I hated it. But Advent Children has become my current addiction.    I don't know anything about the English dubbed version, as I haven't seen it yet. I only own the Japanese (with English subtitles) version of the DVD, which I just recently purchased. And Japanese-wise, the voice acters are AMAZING. Absolutely flawless. No one could've done better. The emotion put into everything vocally, really captures the suspense, and drama the movie wants you to feel.    The overall look of the characters in Advent Children is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! The way the three Sephiroth clones look, is so stunning. You'd have to see it for yourself. Even the way they made Sephiroth himself look, is extremely detailed and captivating. But the best looking character (by far) in the movie, is Tifa.    Then finally, the music is flawless. It was written by none other than the original composer of most ALL of Final Fantasy's music, Nobuo Uematsu. It's all mostly piano oriented (nothing taken right directly from the game itself, but piano re-constructions of the game's music) but very beautifully piano oriented music indeed. There's even a seriously WICKED remix of \\"One Winged Angel\\" (the song from the final battle with Sephiroth in the FF7 game) at the very end of the movie, that has been completely altered, lyrically. And has electric guitars, bass, and drums, added to it. It's like a METAL remix of the song. This one is to NOT be looked over. But yes, the music is possibly the 2nd MAIN reason to see this movie, other than the beautiful character design.    Overall...there's absolutely no reasonNOT to see this movie, unless you haven't played the game, and actually mind not understanding the movie. So if you haven't played the game, I suggest you do so before seeing this, or just skip it. In the end, I think this was a movie strictly meant for the fans alone whom would know what was going on. But who am I to complain? I understood it, and I was reading subtitles for 2 hours. Plus, i've beaten and understood the game. Which is a prime factor in seeing this movie.    I highly suggest Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, but only if you're a hardcore fan and know the game like the back of your hand. Otherwise, you're not going to understand the movie that much. But if that doesn't bother you, and you're just looking to see an action packed beautiful CGI movie, then by all means, consider putting Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children on the top of your \\"to see\\" list.    I give it a 5/5, it blew the hype away.  The hype can't even touch how great this movie is.

B000001Y2U|5.0|It's common knowledge that Marilyn Manson's first few albums sounded like they were made by a bunch of teenagers who were doing their best to sound like a parody of themselves. But then Trent Reznor stepped into the scene and, all of the sudden, Marilyn Manson emerged with what might be the most brilliant album of their career.<br /><br />Like Nine Inch Nails' 1994 album, \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" this is a concept album (meaning it tells a story) which frequently has intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics. \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" supposedly tells the story of a person who is dead inside (this person is referred to as \\"The Worm\\") who is in love with a self-abusive rock star. But there is dispute among fans about what the story is, because, unlike \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" is deliberately vague; it lets the fans put their own meanings to most of the songs.<br /><br />The musicianship on here isn't the best you'll ever hear; the guitars mainly just buzz or beep and make sound effects, and the drum beats are usually simple and thrown in for background noise. Fortunately, \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" has enough stellar songwriting to make up for the not-so-special music. Plus, vocalist Marilyn Manson uses a very wide range of vocal pitches, styles, and tones. He can go from whispering to singing to high pitched vocals to yelling...all in the same song!<br /><br />The album opener, \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem,\\" begins with the sound of a crowd cheering. Then the actual song begins and, during the verses, Marilyn kind of sings in a way that he sounds like Trent Reznor. The choruses are heavy, though; the heavy guitars kick in and Manson yells \\"F*** it!\\"<br />Track two, \\"The Beautiful People,\\" is Manson's first ever hit single. Plus, with only one drum beat (which sounds like Middle Eastern drums at times) and a few crunchy riffs, this is also one of the simplest but catchiest tunes Manson ever wrote.<br />\\"Little Horn\\" combines fast, churning riffs with creepy whispers.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I admit, I never saw Firefly when it was on originally.  I kept meaning to catch it, but somehow never did.  And lo and behold, at about the same time I heard about Serenity coming out, Sci-Fi started airing reruns of the series, in chronological order, something Fox seemed unable to accomplish back in 2002.  I was hooked from the first episode, and had to own the set.  Finally, a science-fiction show where good and bad was simply based on your individual perspective, the machines were dirty -- basically it had more of a realistic feel to it.   <br /> <br />The cast has a remarkable chemistry -- you believe that these people have a history together.  One thing I will say about Joss Whedon -- the man can write.  To this day, I cannot stand Buffy or Angel, but Firefly has become one of my favorites from the first episode.  If you're into solid storytelling, then I recommend this DVD set.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|If you're looking for a movie that's just for laughs, then this is maybe not it.  Sure, there are a few funny parts, but the overall tone is very serious.  Jim Carrey is magnificent in this movie.  Not just a funny bloke but a serious one at that.  If you're looking for a movie to make you think, then this is the one.  The soundtrack is great too, and I suggest you get that as well.
0307276902|4.0|This is Frey's own account of his six-week stay in rehab for drug & alcohol abuse. You're blown away by a lot in this book: Frey's tremendous addiction, his denial of anesthesia during root canals in rehab, & in general, the de-glamorizing of a world hooked on drugs & alcohol. <br />This book is hard to put down. Frey is minute in detailing the events from rehab & his style of writing thus enhances the atmosphere of confinement & monotony. <br />He deserves the utmost credit in writing this horrifying, vivid account. Yet, I was annoyed at his attitude & behavior during rehab. He continued to reject the tradional method recommended for recovery, even knowing that only 17% do not relapse (a high success rate for rehab facilities). He came across as this stubborn, obstinate brat who listened to no one. Having said that, apparently he learned how to make that strong will work for him, not against him. I hope though this unusual method of recovery does not become glamorized, as Frey's example is quite rare. <br />This book will stay in you long after you finish it. Frey does a superb job in explaining what addiction truly is & the life of pure hell that it embodies.
B000002OTL|5.0|Probably no film director is more aware of pop culture than Quentin Tarantino, and few understand the importance of contemporary music in life and therefore in film. His soundtracks are among the best song soundtracks (in contrast to film scores) around, because his juxtaposition of film and music is so intelligent and so thoughtful that the songs become inseparable from the scenes. Can you still hear 'Stuck in the Middle With You' without envisioning Michael Madsen prance around and pour gasoline on a poor cop? If so, you're in minority. As much as he has a knack for creating catchy and quotable phrases and dialogue, Tarantino creates perfect scenes in which the music plays an essential part. <br /> <br />The Pulp Fiction soundtrack is the most eclectic of these collections, and yet it all hangs together perfectly. Tarantino is the only one who could make that sudden change from Dick Dale to Kool & the Gang in the beginning of the movie work, and so it works in the soundtrack - like the different stories hanging together loosely but perfectly in the film, so do the songs. The music here ranges from Chuck Berry to Al Green to Dusty Springfield to Dick Dale - these songs would never work together normally, but again, the songs in Tarantino's films are not background music but an essential part of the film; and therefore the soundtrack is not a collection of songs but instead a film score as complete and coherent as any by John Williams. The few spoken parts included in the soundtrack almost sound out of place, hindering the pace of this bizarre musical creation; they're probably the weakest part of the soundtrack, there mainly to appease casual listeners who bought it only for love of the movie. <br /> <br />Other than the fact that it revived some forgotten greats and fantastic artists who have long ago faded into history - Dick Dale wasn't popular in years as when Pulp Fiction came out - this is also one of the most coherent song-based soundtracks in existence. Ifyou like this kind of soundtracks or if you like Pulp Fiction, don't hesitate to buy it.
6305903182|5.0|This is a sweet film. Mabye the best in the Scream series? I dunno. S2 was good as well. Now, heres S3 and Heres the review:<br /><br />After the death of COtton, a Talkshow host, SId decides to investigate a horror movie called STAB 3, created by Roman. The film is shut down and now the chaos gets worse. Then, the crew come to a good fight.<br /><br />This was great! Not a good as I expected but otherwise great. You should see it!
B00000K2UX|5.0|I LOVE this cd ... soudntracks are almost always the best way to get the songs you love.  This one came with all kinds of bonus tracks and every song is as good as it was in the movie.

Thriller is a classic album and so many good songs...You will never get tired of it. It's not just the sales that make it so big, it's the music that speaks for itself.
B000063JDE|5.0|With Blue Velvet, David Lynch creates a world of the truly bizarre. You will never see Dennis Hopper being more creepy than you will in this movie.  A great performance and great film; one that belongs at the top of Lynch's impressive resume.
B0000025F7|5.0|Michael Jackson is the greatest artist in history....This album is what started him out on his successful solo career <br /> <br />1. Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough  10/10 <br />A Michael classic....If you didn't ever dance to this...You must of never heard it...You can not touch a masterpiece like this.This song hit #1 on Billboard Hot 100 and #1 On R&B singles chart. <br /> <br />2. Rock With You   10/10 <br />The second single from the album...Another classic..I never get tired of this song....This song shot to #1 on the pop and r&b charts...One of my favs <br /> <br />3. Working Day And Night  10/10 <br />Why wasn't this song a single..This could of been a #1 or a Top 5 hit..This song is another favorite of mine...Even though it was the flip side of Rock With You it got alot of airplay on the radio. <br /> <br />4. Get On The Floor  9/10 <br />A good disco song from Michael not one of my fav's but still good.  <br /> <br />5.

She's Out Of My Life  10/10 <br />I like this song alot because you know Michael put alot of emotion into this song..at the end you can actually hear him cry...and they recorded this song like 13 or 14 times and he always cried after and realized that is how the song is suppose to be....An MJ classic shooting to #10 on the pop charts and #4 on the R&B charts. <br /> <br />8. I Can't Help It 8/10 <br />An average song...It's a good song you want to play over and over. <br />       <br />9. It's The Falling In Love 10/10 <br />I like this song because it has a nice beat to it...and It was suppose to be a single but was canceled. <br /> <br />10. Burn This Disco Out  10/10 <br />Great way to end the album....It makes sense...Disco was dieing out and a perfect song to end the album....since it was 1979 <br /> <br />This album remains one of my favorite MJ albums but its no where near my favorite MJ album Thriller and Dangerous... <br />
B000002GKT|4.0|I owned the album back in the 70's, when it first was out, and I literally wore out the grooves! Now hearing the CD so many years later, it takes me back to my teen years up in my room, playing air guitar and screaming along with Steve Marriot I / DON'T / NEED / NO DOCTOR!  <br />It's only Rock and Roll at it's purest level.... Live, and with a routy crowd...just how it should be! <br /> If you were not a teen in the 70's , I'm not so sure if you'll like this CD. It's just like some funny situations or jokes we laugh at...you had to be there to understand.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|\\"Testimony\\" is a very creatively done musical production.  I have listened to this CD repeatedly and still find little nuances that delight the senses.  It only takes one listen to pick up on Neal's influence in the Spock's Beard (SP) classic - \\"Snow.\\"  While I believe that \\"Snow\\" was one of the better SP pieces, I actually feel that \\"Testimony\\" is a better CD, at least musically.   <br /> <br />One feature of \\"Testimony\\" is that some of the musical pieces are repeated throughout the CD.  What's particulary striking is that the same musical piece (or movement) can be altered slightly, yet still retain its rythmic integrity.  More importantly, the second version will sound just as good as the first version.  It's this type of simple genious that makes this such an enjoyable CD.   <br /> <br />The music is very solid otherwise.  Those of us who are Neal Morse fans will require no convincing, and I'm sure that we will continue to enjoy his music as long he is an artist. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this is essentially a musical \\"Behind the Music\\" (VH1 biography) with a Christian and spiritual flair.  Regardless of your religous views, this tells a captivating story.  The lryics are very well done.  Sophisticated, but to the point. <br /> <br />My recommendation is that if you enjoy prog rock, pick this CD up.  It's uplifting and you'll enjoy it with every listen.  I can hardly wait to catch Neal's new CD - \\"?\\" <br /> <br />Neal - hats off to you.  Please keep them coming.
1563894696|5.0|I've always been a big Batman fan and he'd probably be considered my top favorite comic book superhero if I took the time to stop and analyze and risk removing Spider-man from the shared #1 spot (though Spidey doesn't have any good graphic novels that I can think of, at least at the level of Batman's).  Anyway, I got a collection of Batman graphic novels and this is, hands down, one of the best, if not THE best that I've read.  Great story AND great art.  There aren't any other Batman novels I can think of that have equally balanced the two as this one has and I honestly enjoyed it better than Year One or Frank Miller's stuff, which in my opinion are good but still sort of feel like \\"Batman: Alternate Reality\\" and an official Batman storyline.  At any event, this is a good read for any comic book fan.  This story made Two-Face cool enough a character that I think he should take center stage in the next Batman movie, as opposed to Joker.  I think his appearance would make much better chronological sense and if you read this book you'll understand why...Joker should be saved for the third movie...this graphic novel should be read right now!!!
B00002DEGZ|4.0|These discs have to compete with giants of the pianoforte (as opposed to the fortepiano). In general they are successful - but nothing can erase some of the greatest modern performances - by Annie Fisher, Murray Parahia,Zimmerman  etc.<br /><br />But it is a close run thing - and to hear these works as they were originally intended is revelatory. Sir John's contribution cannot be underestimated and reveal new depths to the orchestral part.<br /><br />Malcolm Bilson is first class - and reveals new delights in every concerto. But I have to wonder what other pianists might do, if they took up the challenge of the fortepiano?<br /><br />So - not up to the absolute best new versions - but worth having for the balance and sound that Mozart would have heard.<br /><br />In essence - a great alternative version,
B000002KCC|5.0|\\"Tonight's The Night\\" is, in many respects, the most remarkable record Neil Young has ever made. More to the point, it's an album so marked by pure and unprocessed emotion that you can be certain that you will never hear anything like it again released by a major artist on a major label.  <br />And by 1973, Neil Young was a major artist. Both financially and creatively. \\"Everybody knows...\\", \\"After the Gold Rush\\", and \\"Harvest\\" had all been released, delivering to Young some of the biggest hits of his very long career. But by 1973, Young's success as an artist was being tempered by the losses to excess he was experiencing among those around him. First Danny Whitten, a guitarist with Crazy Horse and songwriter (\\"I Don't Want To Talk About It\\") overdosed on heroin in 1972, using the money Young had given him along with a plane ticket home, fired after a disasterous recording session. Then Bruce Berry, a roadie with Crazy Horse, died at the same hand a year later. <br />With this emotional backdrop, Young recorded several late night sessions with his band of semi finished tunes and less than flawless musicianship. The result is not polished, not always coherent, nor for that matter, in tune. But it remains an extraordinary document of a significant artist grappling with his deepest demons. And he recorded it. Listen to \\"Borrowed Tune\\" with it's lyrics and melody confessing the artistic theft so plainly (\\"I'm singing this borrowed tune, I took from the Rolling Stones. Alone in this empty room, too wasted to write my own\\") and consider the chances you'll ever hear such honesty on record again.
B0002Z1EG2|1.0|Someone has to stop this \\"murder on music row.\\" If artists like Shania and Faith wish to continue producing this trash, do it under another genre than country, for it is NOT. Shania's lyrics have to be the dumbest ever written and hopefully do not indicate the intelligence level of the people purchasing it. Please stop buying this crap for the good of country music. If you like the way she looks, buy a poster, but stop making untalented people filthy rich for releasing this stuff. Hey Shania, try modeling!!!
B00005JNQA|2.0|The underlying plotline is an interesting one; a dictator (or any politico) deflecting heat by making the world witness a reason to feel sympathy for him.  However, the entire line of the story having to do with the interpreter, played by Nicole Kidman, does not make any sense. <br />Assuming the bad guys could set her up to overhear the conversation, what would have happened had she reached Pierre and found out her brother was indeed already dead, ergo he could not have anything to do with the plot?  Would she take the issue further?  Why would she ... where was her motive? <br />Even if you buy into all the improbabilities to do with the interpreter, why would the Secret Service make her a target of investigation? <br />Also, and the capper for me, why would the dictator's henchmen want to kill her ... or, in the alternative, assume they wanted to kill her, why get into her apartment, steal a ceremonial mask, and then stand on the fire escape to scare her???  Why?

0385512104|3.0|I've never read a book from the view of an autistic boy before...but i'm glad i did. It really got you thinking about the way this boy feels and thinks... i feel bad for him. I would reccomend this book to teenage readers who like unique books that make you think.
0553213342|3.0|For the ladies can you imagine a world in which you have no career options except that of being a wife, a world in which everything depends upon how much money you have, and if you're at a loss for lucre, then you'd better marry into some moolah! You don't do anything except go to dances, mooch off richer relatives, and hope you marry somebody before you become a spinster! If you're a man, it's pretty much the same thing, except your career path is more open. You can do a lot if you have money, but like most of the male characters in Sense and Sensibility, why bother?! You got a rich relative to pay your way through life! Just spend your time hunting, whether it be game or a woman, especially a rich woman, if you're a debauched ex-noble who's lost his fortune in disreputable consumerism. All these examples pretty much sum up the world of Jane Austen as portrayed in Sense and Sensibility.<br /><br />Three sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret...Well, let's forget about Margaret, since she's basically a non-character in the book....Well, 2 sisters, Elinor and Marianne are on the prowl for a husband, a well-off husband, since their father has died and left control of his estate to their half-brother, who happens to be married to an uppity and greedy wench of a woman who cuts them out of most of their dead father's money and land. So the sisters and their mother are \\"banished\\" to a charming cottage in the English countryside. Oh, the horror of it, while a lot of England working class and poor were just lucky to find something to eat for dinner in that time period. Elinor is the common sense sister and hopes that Edward loves her, but she can never figure out what his feelings for her are. But she's not going to do anything rash to find out. Just keep a cool head Elinor. Marianne is the exact opposite, youthful, idealistic, passionate, and brash, and falls for the first guy that satisfies her sense of the dashing Byronic hero, even if he might be a cad!<br /><br />I don't know, something about this book rubbed me wrong, even though I thought it was pretty good. All of the characters just seem like parasitic bums, even if they are psuedo-aristocrats. They're lazy, judgemental, and obssessed with appearances, even though they hardly ever have the courage to look under those appearances to see the truth. They really have no activity in their brains. Like animals they are only seeking comfort and security, nothing beyond the most basic of human needs. There is no aspiration to anything. Well, except aquiring money. At some points in the book you wish all of these people had been in France during the Reign of Terror. Then they would have found out their real priorities. I guess, while I could understand the problems of the girls, I didn't sympathize with them. While the spoon they were born with was not silver, at least they had A spoon. It was left to Dickens and Balzac to see how the other half lived. To me, the book's only redeeming value besides Austen's excellent and entertaining style, was to show just how far women have come in the past 200 years, and how lucky they are for being born in the 21st century instead of the 18th!
B0002IVN9W|1.0|This \\"Funeral\\" album got it's share of hype, but it really amounts to nothing more than tripe. <br /> <br />This work has been mentioned in Top 10 lists, album reviews, on Amazon, etc.  I reviewed each song from \\"The Funeral\\" here on Amazon, and I wouldn't spend a single penny at a BMG blowout on it.  I needed a funeral for my ears, as the lead vocals are painful at best.  The album, a limp-risted work, sounded like a cross between Queen and Modest Mouse, and that's probably an insult to Brian May.  The music isn't that good.  If this sounds like your bag, go get this CD.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just finished watching the disks....they are way better than I thought they would be. When my geek friends suggested I watch Firefly I was doubtful. I avoided it for a year at least. Finally I gave in.  I stayed up late after the kids were in bed to watch 2-3 episodes a night; after the first episode I was hooked.  I must see the movie (Serenity) now. <br />Don't be put off because it's sci-fi; and don't be put off because some call it a \\"space-western\\". It's like nothing you've seen before.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This was my first deal at Amazon. I am very happy the way whole deal was setup and complted. The CD itself is a master compilation of the best boy bands ever!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I own this album, and I enjoy it immensly. But I have a few things to say. That dude from LA. I think you need to get out of that smog for a while cuz it's REALLY affecting your thinking. Yeah, you. You know who I'm talking about. You did SO many things wrong. I just hope you know that John Mayer is not spelled \\"Maher\\", it's \\"Mayer\\" you idiot. And he's not \\"EMO\\". He's what we people who actually know music call \\"soft rock\\" or \\"pop\\". Anyways, Creed isn't emo either. How in the hell could you call Creed emo?????????? If you haven't noticed, Creed is rock, and so is Puddle of Mudd. Have you ever listened to them? I bet you haven't. And you should also be beaten with a hammer for listening to My Chemical Romance. And why are you being so hateful? They should be respected for actually having the guts to go out there and make music, even if some people don't like it. But, I do agree with some of your music choices. And by God, if you say anything about me being a redneck jut because I'm from the south, I will personally beat you up. I bet I make more money in a year than you would in 10. So KISS MY ASS!!!!
0395951054|3.0|Well, I've read this book (or tried to) quite a few times and I will admit that it is interesting in spots especially when Hitler describes his beer hall battles with the Reds and the socialists.<br /><br />Ridiculous in some parts, insightful in others, it is overly wordy and I am sure that in many places, Adolf, lost in his torrent of words, even forgets his train of thought until, a few pages later, he seems to find it again.  He does this more or less throughout the whole book.  What anyone else could say in ten words, Adolf uses 30, 40 or even 50.  A good editing could have chopped Mein Kampf at least in half.<br /><br />The political concepts are typical to a half educated mind with an extraordinarily narrow outlook.  Of course, he outlined what he intended to do and eventually did and for this reason alone, you can try reading the book but if you want philosophical enlightenment or insight, read Houston Stewart Chamberlain's 'Foundations of the Nineteenth Century' or Alfred Rosenberg's great work, 'The Myth of the Twentieth Century'.<br /><br />I believe each better explains many of the points and philosophical arguments Hitler is trying to make.
B0006419J6|5.0|Very good sci-fi.  Does not completely follow the book but still is a good movie.  Will Smith fits this movie great.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I cried when it came in the mail and it was very hard to contain myself while I watched it.  Thank you for this gift.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This movie is becoming a classic. Julia and Rochard are at their best. I love a romantic comedy with a happy ending. Call me old fashioned but this is hard to find anymore. This fills the bill!!!!
B00005JO0J|1.0|Horrible film. The characters are shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom. What's missing from Serenity is genuine vision and seriousness--without which, the humor is just sophomoric smalltalk, so formulaic that you can set your watch by it.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|I really was worried how well I would like the second movie of this plot. I really enjoyed the first one and wanted to enjoy this one as well. It took me awhile but I decided while at the movie place to get the film and I must say I was relieved that this film was just as witty and interesting as the first one. Bridget is a cool character that you just have to watch and she doesn't fail on the second story on her. It's a romance comedy in all its glory and even though I usually find romance comedies silly and overdone at times I find both Bridget Jones great and original.  <br />I love the little quiz they give throughout the film as well that makes the movie fun- and that is what this movie is fun and just a film you watch with your friends or when you just need to lift your spirits.  <br />PS- Daniel and Mark fight again- don't miss it it's hilarious.

B00006690G|3.0|I don't know what you think or have heard, but Eminem is the best rapper in the music industry.  Its scary, but he's just as good as 2pac.  \\"The Eminem Show\\" is a nice rap album/  I only gave this album 3 stars because Eminem's interludes essentially follow the same formula, he needs to grow out of that.  The production on some songs is better than others, but the overall production is just above average.  The lyrics on here get pretty deep, even if he is being an ass about it.  His guest appearances are nice as well.  On the overall average, it's a really good album.  It has its share of songs where Em is purposely trying to piss certain listeners off, (i.ei his mother in \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" and \\"Without Me\\").  He also makes a whole lot of sense in some songs like \\"Sing for the Moment\\" and \\"White America\\".<br /><br /> \\"White America\\" is one of the album's best songs.  This is one of Em's deepest songs.  He goes all out lyrically in telling his listeners his opinion about the government.  Everything about this song is on point.  His voice is on this song is something to point out.  He sounds very irritated and angry, helping to get his point across.  \\"Business\\" is a good song, but not one of Em's best.  The production is kind of corny, but him and Dr. Dre are doing their thing!  \\"Drips\\" makes some good points, but it's kind of eerie and scary if you really take a listen.  The production on this song is just weak.  (Sorry Em, don't curse me out in your next song).  \\"Til I Collapse\\", \\"When the Music Stops\\" and \\"Soldier\\" are all fillers.  They are alright lyrically, as a most of his songs, but the songs as a whole are not good.  Most people who have this album like \\"Superman\\".  This song is really funny.  It's one of \\"The Eminem Show's\\" better songs.  It's funny how he likes the female one minute, and hates her the next.  Eminem really did an excellent job on \\"Sing for the Moment\\".  Pay special attention to this song's lyrics.  This is one of the deepest songs I've ever heard.  The way he makes words rhyme that aren't supposed to is creative.  He's definitely the most creative rapper ever.<br /><br />  I recommend this album to rap and r&b fans.  Why, to an r&b fan?  Because usually fans of rap also like r&b, the two music genres coincide essentially.  They are both black folks music.

B000AARKO4|1.0|What a terrible movie!  According to \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" Christians are adulterous murderers, stupid cowards who lose their religion at the first sign of trouble.  Muslims, on the other hand, are wise, peace-loving, tolerant of other religions, and above all, righteous. <br /> <br />What on earth does Hollywood hope to gain by producing this blatant piece of propaganda?  Years ago, it might have been an interesting \\"see other side of the story\\" movie about the crusades, biased in favor of the Muslims.  But to produce it today, after Muslim terrorists have spread their violence across the globe, is as pointless as a movie showing Hitler kissing Jewish babies. <br /> <br />As far as the rest of the movie goes, the fight scenes are overly long, boring, and far too numerous.  The large battle scenes look heavily edited, too much fake smoke and dust obscuring duplicated soldiers and horses, maybe.  The adulterous romance between Orlando Bloom and his princess closely mimics his adulterous relationship in \\"Troy\\".  Don't waste your time on this one.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|The infusion of wailing guitars of 70s rock monsters and the flashy action sequences are all that really separate this movie from the old black-and-white movies I would watch on rainy Sunday afternoons. Matthew McConaughey is buff, Steve Zahn is funny, Penelope Cruz is more than a pretty face, jam-packed with action scenes - all in all this movie was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|Typical Whedon nonsense. The characters are shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom. What's missing from FireFly is genuine vision and seriousness--without which, the humor is just sophomoric smalltalk, so formulaic that you can set your watch by it.
B000AARKO4|4.0|I have watched a few historic movies lately and they have either bored me or irratated me. When my friend picked this up I thought oh no another one. Of course I gave it a shot though because I found Orlando Bloom a great Legolas in Lord of the Rings and thought maybe he could carry that magic into this film. He actually did too. I thought for he to play such a big role he carried it well. I don't know what some of the critics were talking about because I found this movie to be a lot better than some of the other historic films I have watched. The battle scenes were good, at times the pictures were beautiful, the plot was well done and the actors actually were pretty well played out in their characters. Although I still consider Lord of the Rings the strongest point in Orlando's acting career, I think he did a good job with this film- it showed how much he truly can do and this will probably carry him on to even better roles so this is a good step for him.  <br />I recommend this film over many other historic films.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's best film ever. Plot is more complex than Pulp Fiction, Citizen Kane, Memento, The Butterfly Effect...You really need to see this film over and over to understand what is really happening and what is only a dream/fantasy. With its mysterious aura, Mulholland Dr. needs a full-focus, concentrated mind to grasp what might be going on but never satisfies the audience fully. If you want to watch a film that is neither narratively logical, nor has traditional values (beginning, middle, end) or (problem, event, solution, or happiness), this is one of the best films ever made to fit into that post-modern conditions. Maybe there is nothing real in this film after all. No accident, no one becoming a star, no one commiting suicide. There may also be elements of alternative universe in this film; only, we have to take for granted that what is a dream is actually happening. If you buy this film, be sure to watch it with clear mind and complete attention. One of the best films of the 21th century...Thank You David Lynch...
0740748475|5.0|This is by far my favorite comic strip. I own every book made, even the best of's, and am looking forward to buying this just so I can read it without any repition. While I love Calvin, I can't get enough of Hobbes and his philosophical views on life. Some of the quotes in this book are just amazing and have had quite a large impact on my thoughts on life. There is just no other comic strip like this and I highly recommend anyone buying this collection, along with maybe Citizen Dog.
B0002OERI0|5.0|My review on this album is that is is one of the best CD's I have ever heard, even though Dooki was my fave. Give it a try and see what you think about it. Personally I think it is really great. Good for you, Green Day, Keep it up!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a latecomer to Firefly. I had heard very little, and not much to interest me when it was on the air (if the people at Fox understood the show better, they could have promoted it more effectively IMO). But I started hearing good things. With the movie coming out and Sci-Fi running the series, I decided to tune in. I am so glad I did. There are few  shows in very few series that have left me in awe and Firefly has more than its share for so short a run.
B000A59PMO|5.0|i found this dvd set quite by accident while browsing in the BX one day.  I had never heard of this show since i am currntly living in England and it has just started to air over here.  I bought it on a whim not even sure I would keep it.  After the first episode I was hooked.  As an adult its funny to watch the \\"teen drama\\" and remember all the stupid things that were so important than that so arent now.  The mysteries are what kept me watching.  It is a well written and highly entertaining show.  I am anxiously awaiting season 2 to be released or aired over here.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A couple of weeks ago, I was looking for something different to watch and found Firefly in the top 10 dvd sellers on Amazon.   I had never heard of the show before.  I noticed there were over 1300 customer reviews.  I was really surprised because I've never seen that many reviews for any dvd or tv show.  After reading some of the reviews, I was very intrigued and thought of purchasing the show, but I was skeptical because I never really cared for Westerns - although I do like Sci-fi. I decided that for under $40, it was worth a shot and I purchased the set.   I was pretty well hooked after the first couple of episodes and have watched the whole set.   This is a really good show and I'm surprised that it was cancelled.   Many say that FOX didn't give Firefly a proper chance and after having watched it and seeing how good it was, I can see how that may be true.   If you like sci-fi and would like something different, I'd recommend buying this dvd set.  If you like Westerns and Sci-fi, you will probably LOVE this show.  I introduced my boyfriend to it and he said it's one of the best shows he has ever watched.   I'm sorry that this show didn't get a better chance on TV and I hope that it can return in some form.  I was thrilled to find out that the movie Serenity which is in theatres now is a continuation of this series.  I am going to see it today and plan to add it to my dvd collection when it comes out.

B000BB1MIC|5.0|Gilmore Girls is one of those rare shows that has maintained a consistently high standard of quality throughout its run and has even managed to get better with age.  The show started with the Lorelei (Lauren Graham) & Rory (Alexis Bledel) as mother & daughter who are best friends.  Rory was an innocent intellectual who was starting a prestigious high school as sophomore.  Through the years, the show has transformed her from a young girl who lost herself in books and education to a young woman who is experiencing life first-hand.  The change started at the end of season four when Rory sleeps with her ex-boyfriend, the married Dean (Jared Padalecki) and continues in this season with her relationship with the rich Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry).  The change in Rory is startling and Lorelei has a tough time dealing with it thus creating rift between the two.  This season also shows the blossoming of her relationship with Luke (Scott Patterson) and how that relationship is handled by her parents Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Hermann).  One particular funny episode involves Richard taking Luke golfing.  The best episodes of the season involve Richard & Emily's wedding to renew their vows and the fall-out from Emily's visit to Rory's father Christopher (David Sutcliffe) who shows up at the wedding and gets into a verbal fight with Luke.  The season ends with Rory and Logan stealing a yacht and Rory decides to drop out of Yale.  Lorelei goes to her parents for help in this matter and they agree Rory shouldn't drop out.  They provide the cruelest slap of all in Lorelei's face when they renege on their promise and Rory ends up moving into the pool house.  Ms. Graham is particular superb in this season and fact she was snubbed for an Emmy nomination is criminal.  Gilmore Girls continues to be among the best shows on television and season five only reinforces it greatness.
B000B5XZLU|4.0|The thing with Jamiroquai's albums is, when you've heard one of them, you've (almost) heard them all. This album, while groovy and contagious, truly doesn't bring along much innovation to the table. Think of the classic 70s and early 80s disco-meets-Motown sound and you will have a perfect idea of how \\"Dynamite\\" sounds. Not bad, not boring: simply more of the same Jamiroquai. This guy, in spite of the \\"trend\\" in pop that has moved ahead to reviving the 80s, has stuck to his sound. I will give it four stars: I like it, but I don't love it to the point of giving it five stars.
B00003CXDB|5.0|\\"Wall Street\\" is iconic.<br /><br />But let's step back a second: I'll beging with a little Wall Street habit called Full Disclosure: Oliver Stone's stunning, iconic \\"Wall Street\\" is an amazingly hard movie for me to review, in part because it was, for me, one of those rare watershed events that shaped my futue and changed---even charted---my career.<br /><br />One of Oliver Stone's best movies, it was intended as a morality play in which Stone's mouthpiece, played by Martin Sheen as a stoic airline mechanic who has seen it all, condemned the helter-skelter rampant greed of the corporate raiders, Wall Street insider tycoons, and high-flying investment bankers of the 1980's, the much maligned \\"Decade of Greed\\".<br /><br />But let's stop for moment, and consider: how many of you who've seen the film wanted to *be* Gordon Gecko, \\"Wall Street\\"'s cigar chomping, greenmailing uber-dealmaker, who ratcheted up Ivan Boesky's \\"Greed is OK\\" into what became the motto of deal-makers the world over: \\"Greed is Good. Greed Works.\\"<br /><br />I sure did. Born during the hippy Summer of Love and a proverbial child of the eighties, I saw \\"Wall Street\\" and knew, immediately, what I wanted to become. I sliced off my mohawk, grew my hair, and slicked it back, and dedicated my life to mastering high finance and the art of the deal.<br /><br />And I wasn't the only one, to judge by fellow MBA alums and investment banking colleagues; even a sequence in \\"Boiler Room\\" shows a new generation of deal-seeking young Turks watching \\"Wall Street\\" on a plasma TV, regaling each other with their word-perfect recitation of Gecko's lines.<br /><br />\\"Wall Street\\", then, should be served up piping hot to the innocent with a dollop of caution: as one reviewer noted, what Stone had intended as a bloody criticism of greed gone rampant quickly became a full-bodied recruiting video for the investment banking industry.<br /><br />And what a recruiting video it is: Stone perfected his quick cuts and 'wall of information' with \\"Wall Street\\", proving his mastery of the new MTV-era of rich, lush, rapidly moving images and an editing style that wouldn't have been out of place in a music video.<br /><br />Stone is like that. As a director, he has an uncanny ability to glamorize that which he most wants to criticize, just as he did with the alluringly violent Mickey and Mallory Knox in \\"Natural Born Killers.\\"<br /><br />And \\"Wall Street\\" is one of those rare reversals where life imitates art: throughout top-tier MBA programs and modern investment banks, the image of the stalking, cigar-smoking, summer-home in the Hamptons, limo-insulated, braces-sporting deal maker has become the ideal, sometimes getting the better of real Wall Street mavericks who let romance cloud their common sense and appeared on the covers of Fortune and Forbes---only to be shot down by their envious employers.<br /><br />The plot is nothing new: a Horatio Alger story in which hungry young stockbroker (played perfectly by Charlie Sheen) Bud Fox tires of spending his days in a cheap Queens apartment chasing small retail investors, and sets his sights on the 'elephant': the maverick corporate raider Gordon Gecko (played by Michael Douglas in the role of his career).<br /><br />Fox, for once, has an opening beyond Gecko's favorite box of cigars: he knows his father's airline, Blue Star, is worth more than the market thinks it is because of impending deregulation in the airlines; Gecko takes the bait, and brings Fox, quickly, into the high-octane world of deal-making and insider information---as Gecko's spy.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly good: apart from Sheen and Douglas, you have the inimitable Sean Young as Gecko's social-climbing wife, Darryl Hannah puckish as fashion designer Darien, pre-\\"The Limey\\" Terence Stamp hard as nails as a British corporate raider and Gecko's nemesis, and a troop of veteran character actors: Hal Holbrook as Fox's brokerage house mentor, James Spader as a naive M&A attorney,and the immortal James Karen as Fox's fickle boss.<br /><br />From the opening riffs of Sinatra's \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" to the closing image of a trading grid imposed over the lower Manhattan skyline, Stone's editing and direction is fast-paced, frenetic, and exotic: the viewer, like Fox, is pulled into the upper reaches of a world where anything is possible and money is the common denominator.<br /><br />There are some subtle touches, like Gecko's beach house, festooned with atrocious artwork kept only as an investment---and as a barometer of the notoriously fickle and fast moving Market itself.<br /><br />And for those \\"Wall Street\\"-heads who have seen the movie a thousand times (I must be getting close), there are some sweet glitches the editors never caught: when Gecko makes his pitch for a 'friendly' takeover of Blue Star, watch his feet carefully.<br /><br />Often imitated, never surpassed, \\"Wall Street\\" is a stylish, intoxicating, stunning embodiment of an era when anybody could carve his way to the very top of American society by ruthless ambition and sheer determination; it was true when it was made, and it is possibly even more true today.<br /><br />So strap on your braces, slick back your hair, light up an Esplendido and fire up the DVD player---money never sleeps, pal.<br /><br />JSGSpader as a naive M&A attorney, and the immortal James Karen as Fox's fickle boss.  <br /> <br />From the opening riffs of Sinatra's \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" to the closing image of a trading grid imposed over the lower Manhattan skyline, Stone's editing and direction is fast-paced, frenetic, and exotic: the viewer, like Fox, is pulled into the upper reaches of a world where anything is possible and money is the common denominator.  <br /> <br />There are some subtle touches, like Gecko's beach house, festooned with atrocious artwork kept only as an investment---and as a barometer of the notoriously fickle and fast moving Market itself.  <br /> <br />And for those \\"Wall Street\\"-heads who have seen the movie a thousand times (I must be getting close), there are some sweet glitches the editors never caught: when Gecko makes his pitch for a 'friendly' takeover of Blue Star, watch his feet carefully. <br /> <br />Often imitated, never surpassed, \\"Wall Street\\" is a stylish, intoxicating, stunning embodiment of an era when anybody could carve his way to the very top of American society by ruthless ambition and sheer determination; it was true when it was made, and it is possibly even more true today. <br /> <br />So strap on your braces, slick back your hair, light up an Esplendido and fire up the DVD player---money never sleeps, pal. <br /> <br />JSG
B000002OCP|3.0|well, this is the kind of album that drives blues purist nuts, but, since i'm not in that bunch i can freely suggest to give it a listen. yeah, at the time it was a sort of quickie, but in some strange way it passed the test of time. With a superb band Muddy delivers a vocally strong performace but it's the ensemble playing that is really mouthwatering, expecially the fine work of pete cosey, later of miles davis agartha period fame, that delivers stunning solos all over an almost ferocius rhythm patterns. This album also resurfaced as the core of the scorsese blues story dvd, namely on \\"goodfathers & sons\\". This is a great introduction to this strange album, and public enemy chuck d clealy explains its impact of the music to come.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|This soundtrack was better than the mini series soundtrack. I have listened to it non stop in my car for a month. I love it and am hoping they do a season 2.
B00000K0E5|4.0|Typical of the 007 genre this one has all the chase scenes and explosions you would expect or want including Bond chasing the bad guys through St. Petersburg in a tank destroying everything it his path. The plot is interesting and the whole thing is less camp than some of the Roger Moore flicks. That's true even with a Russian villainess who's thighs squeeze the life from her prey leaving the corpse with a smile on his face. There is a Russian computer nerd named \\"Boris\\" and I have to admit expecting a line about \\"making big trouble for moose and squirrel\\" but it never happens. There is no sign of Grace Jones in this Bond either so I'm happy on both counts.  <br /> <br />On the home front \\"Q\\" has become even more crotchety and impatient of 007 and \\"Moneypenny\\" has been replaced with a newer model more suited to the younger Bond's innuendoes.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|If long-time DCFC fans think 'Plans' is a sell-out I have some advice: Get over yourselves!  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  It is by far the best album of the year and it would not surprise me to see multiple nominations come Grammy time.  Vividly beautiful and haunting it showcases Ben's best songwriting efforts and the band's best performance ever.  The only thing that has changed with DCFC is that the move to a major label allowed for a better studio and production value.   <br /> <br />This should be in everyone's CD collection!  <br /> <br />

All the melody's come creeping on you and they won't let go. So your going into several phases in liking one song best!<br /><br />Paul has made a brilliant album, going deeper into his lyrics, sounding mature and still find room for joy in his music.<br /><br />He does play almost every instrument himself, which makes it even more intimate. Go out and listen to it. If you don't like it after 5 times, then you missed the point. When you like it after 5 listens your hooked forever.<br /><br />Paul thanx again for your musical magic.<br /><br />1. Fine line- nice little boogie typed rocker. Piano is pumping, great hooks.<br /><br />2. How kind of you - a song that grows and gives me shivers.<br /><br />3. Jenny Wren - acoustic classic.<br /><br />4. At the mercy - a real album song, fresh sounding, a bit sounding like some \\"tug of war\\" songs.<br /><br />5. friends to go - paul sings with himself in different voices, the \\"harrison\\" song. great<br /><br />6. English tea - very beatle like, happy song with great bridge (\\"when i'm 64\\" meets \\"you gave me the answer\\")<br /><br />7. too much rain - heavy lyrics, one of many highlights, a comforting song<br /><br />8. a certain softness - play it often, i did get it after 8 or 9 listens, a latin feel, with a 1920/1930 sonwriting craftmanship, he is showing off here!<br /><br />9. Riding to vanity fair - lots af tension in this song, you'll hear the most \\"radiohead\\" connection, lyrics strong about losing friendship.<br /><br />10. Follow me - a different song from the rest, the  middle eight is very beatleish, went well during the live performances as well.<br /><br />11. a piano rocker -  could have been on \\"ram\\" and thats a big compliment, listen to the funky guitar solo.<br /><br />12. this never happened before - for the lovers, loving, not sentimental, and beautiful off course.<br /><br />13. Anyway - another love song, why not, he pulls it of again, with a great ending (you inmediately want to hear it again)n, with a great ending (you inmediately want to hear it again)
0385484518|5.0|Everyone must read this book - teenagers through adults will love this book.  Everyone has somebody that Morrie will remind them of, somebody that touched their lives in an amazing way.  Morrie reminds us all that life is too short to hold grudges, too short to disappear from the world and too short to care only for money and material things.  The people around us, the ones who touch our lives in some way, are all gifts we should cherish.  Thank you Mitch Albom, what a wonderful story to share with the world.
B00005BL2A|2.0|Sometimes it's better for bands not to release an album for a while.  This is a perfect example of that.

B000AARKOO|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so historically inaccurate it wasn't even funny. I watched this on vacation on the in room movies and I wanted to throw myself from the balcony. The acting was terrible, but that doesn't even matter. It was like they completely ignored the histoy while writing this movie. I had just taken a college history course at my university and we had discussed the Third Crusede (the one this movie is supposed to be about). The main struggle was between Richard the Lion Hearted and Saladin. Not Saladin and some random blacksmith. Yes, Saladin took Jerusalem before the Third Crusade, but it did not happen in any way like it was portrayed in the movie. And that's not even the half of it. There were so many things in this movie that were historically inaccurate I could probably write a hundred pages on those alone. Stay away from this movie.

It is a wonderful book that I would recomend to any theater or Wicked fan.  It is one wickedly good book!
B000063JZQ|5.0|Here we have an example of film enhancing the quality of the written word rather than degrading it; which is, unfortunately, all too often the case with popularizations. This version of MacBeth, the product of the vision of Roman Polanski and the late but outstanding writer Kenneth Tynan, does justice to a play that is perhaps the finest in the English language. The movie accomplishes a great many things such as giving viewers newfound respect for Hugh Hefner who was its executive producer. This is literature that speaks and bounds with the edge of man and the blood of centuries.<br /><br />Macbeth captures the mood of the middle ages and the blackness present, at some level, within us all. In its gore and violence, it is a distinctly Mansonesque take on the classic. This should not be surprising given the unhappy recent events which befell Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate. We are given a concrete reminder of that hellacious crime with the visual revelation of MacDuff being hacked out of his mother's stomach before she could give birth to him. If you ask me, Jon Finch is the perfect Thane of Cawdor and Francesca Annis makes a maniacal and breathtaking Lady MacBeth. This is a study of madness, guilt, and the true results of man's lust for power. Yet, unlike real life, here, the wicked end wickedly which is why it is great art. This is a production worthy of Shakespeare. Polanski's talents are appropriately rated.
B000002INR|5.0|This is a Classic, all songs are great, heavy pop- heavy ballads, classics such as 18 and life, I remember you, one of the best 80's music on a great CD, I think must be re-released on a Remaster 20-bits or better, add classics such as: \\"Holydays on the sun\\" cover, Demo of \\"Forever\\" and the 5 songs from the B-Ourselves, there is enough space on the 80 minutes on a CD, will be very attractive to buy again  What is waiting the Rhino Records?

If you like the \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" series, then you will LOVE this one.  It is exciting and keeps you on your toes.  It has a fabulous cast with wonderful dialog.  I can't say enough good things about this DVD.  The commentaries are funny and give you a peek into the actors themselves.  The actors are all equally as talented and each has characters intergral to the overall plot of the series.  The worse thing about the DVD is that when it ends, it leaves you wanting more.  Don't miss it!!   The WB really missed the boat with Firefly.  How sad for all of us!
0060005424|4.0|If you were to read Lirael as a stand-alone book, you'd miss out. While Sabriel, it's predecessor, functions well by itself, Lirael, instead, is definitely part of a set. In this book we meet Lirael and Sameth, and follow them as they evolve from sheltered children into adventurers.<br /><br />The story we absorbed in Sabriel is expanded upon, and the new saga is nearly as interesting. There is one sore point: it's far more obvious in Lirael that this is reading meant for a younger audience. Garth Nix's tone becomes more condescending, and he over-explains too many points of the premise.<br /><br />In short, Lirael is just fine, but read it only if you mean to read Sabriel beforehand and Abhorsen after.
0790729407|5.0|I disagree with the person saying that \\"Ireland was not a colony\\". A tactic of imperial powers has historically been to legitimise their rule over a colony by officially annexing the territory into the state. That allows them to say afterwards that such a place is not a colony but part of the overall stste etc. England (the predecessor the Britain) conquered Ireland in 1169 because a traitor called Dermot McMurrough (also known as Dermot na Gal - Dermot of the Foreigners) invited them in during a power struggle with the High King of Ireland Rory O'Connor.  <br /> <br />I also object to the claim made by a user from Houston TX that Collins was a terrorist. Most countries on the map today would not exist today but for insurrection against an imperial power e.g. South and Central America broke away from Spain, the US broke away from Britain, African countries often only became independent after revolts. In the main, the Old IRA (1919-21) as distinct from the later IRA's (Anti-Treaty IRA, CIRA, RIRA, PIRA) did not target civilians. It is true that collaborators with the British government were targetted. However, the same was true in Vichy France where the French Resistance attacked collaborators with the regime. I think that a right to insurrection exists where a people are being oppressed.
B00005JNQS|4.0|I gotta tell ya, I just don't get some of these one and two star reviews. Sure, this isn't \\"Finding Nemo\\" or \\"The Incredibles\\", but it's still a nice little CG film. <br />  <br />Some of the reviewers complain that the plot doesn't make sense. Well, I didn't have any problem following the plot. <br />  <br />All of jokes and sight gags may not be side-splitting hilarious, but they're amusing. <br /> <br />The CG is excellent. <br /> <br />Basically, the plot and voice work get three stars and the audio/visuals get five stars, so the movie averages out to four stars.
6304708491|4.0|This updated review refers to the recent Deluxe Edition release of HELP! Bottom Line Up Front: The Deluxe DVD edition has quite a few extras, but the movie remains essentially the same as previous releases.  For purposes of this review all upper case references to HELP! refer to the movie, whereas upper and lower case entries, Help!, refer to the song.<br /><br />HELP! took the group from their quasi-realistic beginnings in A HARD DAY'S NIGHT to a fantasy world where bad guys with evil plots are foolish enough to take on the Beatles.  In short:  Ringo dons a new ring on his finger.  Unfortunately the ring is a piece of sacrificial jewelry and the high priest, played by Leo McKern, travels to England with his henchmen to reclaim the sacred relic.  In their efforts to relieve themselves of the ring the Beatles are also pursued by a mad scientist, played by Victor Spinetti, and his assistant portrayed by lovable Roy Kinnear (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory).  The on and off again chase follows the Beatles around London, Salisbury Plain, Austria, and the Bahamas.  Quite different from the simple plot in their previous movie.<br /><br />Originally released in 1965, HELP! received generally favorable reviews, although over the years its popularity has been overtaken by its predecessor A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.<br /><br />This is the fifth copy of HELP! I have purchased over the years.  The first was a remastered MPI VHS copy that was released in 1987.  This release followed a similar and prior year's re-release of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  In both cases the films were restored and the plan was to get the movies back into theaters.  Unfortunately in the case of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT the re-release had minimal distribution and thus was disappointing in terms of revenue.  As such HELP! went straight to VHS and laser disk.<br /><br />It was great to finally have HELP! on home video, but the VHS version was not the same one originally screened in theaters in 1965.  Much like A HARD DAY'S NIGHT the mono music soundtrack was replaced with an overdubbed (or remixed if you prefer) stereo version.  Replacement of the mono track also removed - actually blanketed -- some of the film's original sound effects.  Of greater concern was that the replaced tracks did not closely match the Beatles' original lip-synching to a highly calibrated Nagra recorder.  This is not to imply that the original 1965 film gave the impression of live performances.  It is just that they looked and sounded better synchronized in the original film.<br /><br />The most notable difference between the film and the subsequent releases is the replacement of the movie's theme song.  The original cinematic release of the movie features Help!, played at both the beginning and conclusion of the film, was identical to the version that appeared on the Capitol 45 rpm single (and later appeared on the Capitol Rarities album).  An ever so slightly increased vocal tempo version of Help! appeared on subsequent domestic and imported albums, as well as in the remastered VHS and DVD versions of HELP!  The last time we were treated to the virgin unaltered version of HELP!, complete with the original mono soundtrack, was several years ago on AMC.<br /><br />Following the 1980s HELP! was released on tape two additional times and was subsequently released on DVD.  The DVD version was almost identical to the VHS release.  The special features were limited to film trailers, radio spots, and black and white stills and various black and white film footage.<br /><br />The current deluxe set has a lot to offer in the way of extras.  There is a copy of Richard Lester's annotated script, a book with lots of color photos from the movie, five-by-seven reproduction color lobby cards, and a movie poster.  Additionally the set contains a special features disk.  The special features disk includes a short documentary on the making of the film including interviews with Richard Lester.  John, Paul, George, and Ringo are also heard in interviews taken from 1965.<br /><br />There is also a segment regarding the color negative restoration and subsequent digitized cleanup.  No doubt a very time consuming process.  However the end result differs very little from previous releases.  This new release of HELP! was advertised as including a lost scene. Remember that A HARD DAY'S NIGHT advertised the same thing and the missing scene of Paul and one of the dancers ended up being nothing more that a couple black and white stills on the special features disk.  The same holds true for the \\"missing\\" scene in HELP!<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition is worth your while if want to add the script, book, lobby cards, and poster to your collection.  Otherwise you are best served sticking with the standard edition.is also a segment regarding the color negative restoration and subsequent digitized cleanup.  No doubt a very time consuming process.

0140177396|4.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" in my opinion was a great book, it had all the things that cought my interest. But as the story went on and bad things kept happening and happening it just made me dislike the book that mutch more.  Like the fact that lennie kept doing things accadentally doing things wrong and getting in trouble for them even with his condition just made me think the book wasn't my style. I probably disliked this book also because the fact that it was a school assignment and for me when it is a school required book it never seems that good. By the time i got to the end of the book i was kind of fed up with the book but i still thought it was generally good, but when i finished the book i was angry becouse all i could think about was, \\"how could they do that to such a great character!\\" the way the book ended makes the book seem bad to me but if you were to ask me when i was half way through the book i would say its a great book. Over all the book is very good but has some bad twists, i would recomend it.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Some said laughing at this gentle affectionate comedy is an act of cruelty. Maybe the fact that they feel constrained from laughing reveals a deep sense of superiority to the world portrayed in this wonderful film. Why is it that some say we should not laugh at others? Is it bcause they laugh out of derision while others laugh out of self-recognition, sympathy and a good dose of irony? I laughed or smiled through this entire film. The only people I felt deserved derision were the bullies and the self absorbed adults. The bizarre take on the nature of romance that permeates this film is wonderful and offers some truly hilarious moments as well as some very touching, heart warming ones. The technical qualities of this film are superb and really helps to create a picture postcard flatness that enhances the surreal, almost David Lynch like pace and nature of the film. Unless a viewer is harboring deep seated and repressed animosity to this world or thinks that every movie that pokes fun at the soft underside of the belly of America is being cruel,everyone should be able to watch and enjoy this unique piece of American cinema.
0393317552|4.0|The presentation, although Historically correct, has in its slant a definite liberal bias.  The approach is slanted to the left in analysis and wording.  Early human development is simplistic and trite.  Geography is hinted as the major determiner of the development of Eurasian technology and social forms. This is a new and interesting premise.

B000002IAZ|3.0|I love the Buffalo Springfield and all of the songs on this CD... however it is an OLD analog recording which I did not realize when I bought it.  The sound quality is not good. So trying to mix it in with other music it sounds flat and the recording volumes are lower.  So now I will be surfing to find something by them that has been digitally remastered.  It sucks to get such great music and have it in the old analog format.  So while I highly recommend the songs on the CD, I would try to find them on something that has been digitally remastered to avoid disappointment.

3822835412|5.0|I'm surprised someone hasn't reviewed this book yet.  It's quite a treasure. <br /> <br />Some months ago, during an excursion to the Met in NYC, I was feeling a little homesick for Paris, so my eye was immediately drawn to this book.  I'm really quite glad that I found it, for it's easily one of my favorite photography books.  It actually reads like a book of essays, but in a photographical format.  There is an introduction at the front (in French, English, and German) giving a brief background in the history of French photography, but one can easily enjoy the book without bothering with this intro.  The pictures pretty much speak for themselves, from mid-19th century Parisian alleyways to the joy on people's faces during the city's liberation in 1944. <br /> <br />First things first: the book is slightly taller than most books, so it may be a little tricky to store on a shelf.  I made do, particularly since I use those metal cube shelves you get from Target, which are substantially taller than typical bookshelves.  All of the photographs are in black and white, which forms some really nice contrasts and creates an overall sense of timelessness.  We're dealing, after all, with Paris from the advent of photography to recent fashion (I believe the latest picture in the book is from the 1980s). <br /> <br />As stated earlier in this review, things like the Liberation are covered, as well as lots of other historical events (the Occupation, the student riots of the 1960s, ect).  But these great moments in history are the anomalies.  For the most part, the book chooses to focus on everyday events in Parisian life, past and present, like little children skipping rope in the 1920s, or well-to-do ladies watching a horse race at the turn of the last century, or two college students trading a kiss in a bistro in the 1970s. <br /> <br />It's the little touches like this that really bring the city to life.  Coming from someone who has lived in Paris twice and considers it another home, this is a very nice compliment, and I think it would make a particularly nice addition to one's coffee table.  I only wish it were a little bigger, but it's already over 200 pages, so I guess I'm just trying to prolong a good thing.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Being someone who just bought FF's second album and not the first (due to money constraint and etc), I have not much expectation. I am very happy that I bought this album just a day ago and could already remember the lyrics to all the songs. The songs are very catchy and very easy to listen to. This album is probably the catchiest album I've ever heard. Songs like The Fallen, Do You Want To, This Boy, Evil and a Heathen, make you wanna just stomp your feet and dance away. All the songs are single potential. The lyrics are witty and very entertaining too. Time passes very fast when you listen to the album. You just have to buy this album - it's really great. I don't know if it's better than the first, but after listening to this for a solid day, I am so hooked, I'm buying more for my friends :) <br />

0962477060|5.0|After wrestling with the concepts and philosophies presented by Mr. Bill Edwards in Fretboard Logic SE, I am confident, as a guitar player of 15 years, that Fretboard Logic SE (in conjunction with Fretboard Logic Volume III) has provided me with more useful guitar knowledge than any other product on the market that I've tried.  Believe me, there have been a lot of products.  I'm a guy that likes to understand \\"Why.\\"  This book not only answers that question, but it also gives answers to all the fundamental \\"How\\" questions about the guitar. Unlike other so-called \\"methods\\" advertised in guitar magazines, this work actually provides a methodology for understanding the nature of the guitar's tuning, fretboard organization, and the physical requirements of playing tones with a guitar.  Presented here is the \\"framework\\" of the instrument as opposed to techniques built upon that framework.  This knowledge is indespensible for learning to be a practical guitarist, and it transcends the meager boundaries of style books and videos in order to make the reader a source of knowledge regarding the guitar. <br /> <br />  It is correct that Mr. Edwards did not reinvent the wheel with this book.  All of these concepts have been floating around since the guitar or any of its cousins have graced the world of music.  Nevertheless, the clarity and concise nature in which Mr. Edwards presents the information has not yet been replicated or improved on successfully.   <br /> <br />  It is also correct that this book does not teach \\"Music theory\\" in the conventional sense.  This book teaches \\"guitar theory,\\" and it teaches that theory very well.  Upon reading the reviews of Fretboard Logic SE, I was amused consistently by the the comments made by the method's detractors that \\"it dosen't teach music theory,\\" etc.  Well, yes, Mr. and Mrs. Uniformed Critic, you're right.  It teaches only enough music theory as to explain the organization of the fretboard matrix.  I suggest to you detractorsthat you examine Mr. Edwards' third volume of the Fretboard Logic series prior to engaging in further pointless criticism.   <br /> <br />I suppose Mr. Edwards could have presented all of the information in the series as one volume in order to pass savings onto the consumer.  On the other hand, for those that wish to save money, he does offer the course in one package deal.  So, really, the whole \\"we need to buy more books\\" argument is kind of fallacious.  Moreover, even if we assume, in arguendo, that the argument is true, the guitar is an expensive hobby, and if you're using it to make money, there's a lot of overhead involved.  So, suck it up and get over it; educational expenditures for a professional are tax deductible. <br /> <br />  Will Fretboard Logic make you a guitar legend?  Perhaps it can lead you in that direction, but the perseverance necessary to achieve that goal lies only within the student.  Will you play well enough to impress your friends and get girls (or boys)?  Maybe, but there again, its all in your level of devotion to the instrument.  Doing something worthwhile takes effort, and if you love it, the effort will be worth it.  In that same vein, learning all the facets of something you love gives you perspective and more than a passing degree of humility regarding your own abilities.  I thank Bill Edwards for helping me along that road of learning. <br /> <br />   <br />
B000784WMW|3.0|Jane Eyre is my absolute favorite book, so I've seen nearly every film adaptation of it, including this one. Timothy Dalton couldn't have been more perfect as the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester, but Zelah Clarke drove me nuts as Jane, one of the best literary heroines ever written. Clarke is WAY too old to play 18-year-old Jane, and she misses the whole idea of Jane's coming-of-age. She acts like what she is--a 25-30ish woman. She's not a terrible actress; she's just not a good fit for the character. <br /> <br />And the look of the film itself bothers me a bit. The cinematography makes it look as though someone took his/her home camcorder and taped the whole thing from one vantage point in each room. Don't expect sweeping vistas or a rich soundtrack, but on the whole it isn't a bad adaptation.

0393324818|5.0|Baseball runs a distant 4th in my pantheon of sports behind football, basketball and boxing, but I was still impresssed by the profundity of his arguement on the true nature of the game.  That said, this is not just a baseball book.  Baseball & the aberrant success of the Oakland A's vis a vis their free market competitors is only the medium for a broader discussion about how we assess and assign value.  This is a book for those who champion the rational, the scientific method, the slaying of myth, the quantifiable & demonstrable vs. those who champion mysticism, lazy tradition, and the sequestering of knowledge to \\"the properly credentialed.\\"        The depth of the parallels that can be drawn from this book to financial markets, geopolitics, and government/business are limited only by the capacity of the reader.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|First of all I have the Old RCA version on CD... not an audiophiles dream, nevertheless..I think this version is just fine...the slight distortion accentuates the classic feel this awesome Album gives you.  All songs sound good. The main thing all these audiophiles forget is the MUSIC itself. I love this album...I wish I could time warp back to 1967 and see this band perform, take some hits and hang with tha gentiles. You know, that whole love and peace movement...it gave people a new awareness that the crew-cut 50s could never offer...but you know that! Grace's voice is the highlight of this group.. With all the numerous changes this band continued to go through, you think they might've released an album 1/4 as good as Surrealistic Pillow.. The thing is ...this band seized the moment of the times and put out a classic that will never be duplicated. It is # 146 on The Rolling Stone 500 Best albums of all time...should be in the top 100 at least.
0142000663|4.0|By Nicole Fasola<br /><br />I thought The Grapes of Wrath was a very well adapted movie, from the original novel by John Steinbeck.<br /><br />The movie (and book) was about Tom Joad, a man (played by Henry Fonda), whose Oklahoma based family is forced to move out after the Great Depression. Their only chance to find work was to pack up and move to California where 800 workers were supposedly needed. They then go on a long journey to California to find out that workers weren't really as needed as they thought.<br /><br />One of the things that really differentiate the movie from the book was that a majority of time in the book was spent actually looking for work once the Joad's were in California. In the movie, it seemed like they were in the car the whole time. I think that one of the problems with adapting such a long book like The Grapes of Wrath into a movie is choosing what to include. The screenwriter's chose to go into more detail about how difficult it was to get to California, and all that they faced going there, instead of when they actually got to California and had to search for jobs.<br /><br /> Some other things about the movie that were different from the book were how minor characters in the books didn't have as big of roles in the movie. For example, in the book, there was a couple called the Wilson's, that actually traveled with the Joad's for a while. There were not included in the movie at all. Some other characters that weren't included were minor characters who would go to work with the Joad's, or eat with them.<br /><br />I thought that the cast of The Grapes of Wrath was very good. I especially thought that \\"Ma Joad\\" was very much the same in the book and movie. She had the same toughness in both installments, and also had an emotional side. I thought the transition from book to movie for Tom Joad wasn't as good. In the book, he seems more like a tough, scary kind of guy, while in the movie, he seems more sensitive, and emotional. He didn't seem like he could have actually killed a guy.<br /><br />The last thing that they could've added into the movie would've been the last part of the book! The movie ends when Tom leaves the family and the family packs up and moves somewhere else. They never even got to the part where Rose of Sharon has her baby. That part of the book isn't essential for the story, but it does help conclude things nicely.<br /><br />Even though there are many thinks that I think they should have done differently, I still thought that it was very well made. It really showed how difficult it was to get to California, how the family was breaking apart, and how difficult it was finding work. The book and movie are both worth investing time in..

B000BKVQTS|1.0|The Brothers Grimm (* 1/2) comes off as a what the hell was that boo disappointment movie Directed by Terry Gilliam, who I like, but this really is a far cry from his other movies like Twelve Monkeys and The Fisher King. Will Grimm, played by Matt Damon, the good Ben Affleck (upcoming Scorsese movie The Departed, Dogma) who loses the accent along the way somewhere in the film and his jittery brother Jake Grimm, played by Heath Ledger (Lords Of Dogtown, 10 Things I Hate About You), are two brothers who make up stories, well Jake does the work and Will plays along with it. In the beginning the brothers vanquish a witch from a town, which is a fake, they made it up. Then comes the real deal where they go to a village where 11 girls have gone missing...two including one dressed up like Little Red Riding Hood and the other named Greta (Gretel). The Grimm brothers set out, with a huntress, played by Lena Headey (The Cave, Gossip). Her father vanished a long time ago and it was so obvious that the wolf in the woods was her father..duh. She tells them about this witch, this witch who was in a high tower and over the years she withered and died. The Grimm Brothers then set out and find that the forest is alive and maybe it's not in their imagination. Then, they find out that the witch is still in the high tower and see needs 12 girls for their youth. Funniest part in the entire movie was when actor Peter Stormare (Constantine, The Big Lebowski) kicks a kitty cat into a spinning whirly device. The rest is a big mixed bundle of disappointment...granted, there are some clever ideas in there but it just didnt cut it for me. Also starring Monica Bellucci (The Matrix Revolutions, Brotherhood Of The Wolf) and Jonathan Pryce (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Ronin). What the hell was with the muddy ginger bread cookie man? Did we need that Terry Gilliam? No...what about the horse swallowing the girl? No, No. Ledger and Damon do what they must in this very off movie. When I saw the shiny gold ring in the movie I was remembering back to Lord Of The Rings and I was expecting Viggo Mortensen or Orlando Bloom to pop out and shove the Brothers aside and show them how it's done. Peter Stormare's French man is annoying as hell
B000002KGT|5.0|This is one of the few albums that I can listen to from beginning to end on a regular basis.  Very few albums don't have a true miss on the line-up.  Sure, I have my favorites, but there is truly not a bad song on the album.  It is a piece of rock history that will never go away.  It is a timeless classic.
B0002IU988|5.0|Sure, I liked Creed, but finally Mark Tremonti gets a chance to show off some of the shred that didn't quite fit into Creed. Its cool that he uses an alternate tuning to get some original sounds into his solos, particaulary on the track \\"Open Your Eyes\\". Compared to those in alot of the other modern music of today, Kennedy is very talented as a vocalist and does not need to scream to make his point. There is hope for modern rock.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Not a short and pithy fable such as Aesop would write, but a morality play nonetheless, \\"Crossroads\\" presents a side of Ralph Macchio (\\"The Karate Kid\\") we never knew existed -- excellently twinkle-fingered on the guitar. <br /> <br />Reminiscent of the song of the devil going down to Georgia and getting into a guitar-playing contest, the champion of which wins a soul, Macchio's character has a play-off with the Devil, played by Steve Vai, for the soul of an old blues-man who sold his soul for fame and is now facing his mortality. <br /> <br />Along the way, Macchio learns that suffering and grit have more to do with being a real blues man than his Julliard classic training. Yet, it is this classical training that eventually beats the devil. <br /> <br />As in life, technical excellence, tempered by suffering and experience, become the stuff of character building. <br /> <br />If you don't like morality tales, watch it to see Steve Vai in action. Macchio is quite a surprise on the guitar, performing almost all of the scenes himself. He was coached extensively by Vai for this movie.
B00025ETIW|1.0|What's happening to popular taste in music these days? I see dozens of kids my age every day who are big fans of this stuff, but it just isnt appealing. The guitar work is pretty thin and the vocals of this album (and albums in this punk/emo/gothic genre) are annoying after a few minutes. I'm glad there are still a few bands that are staying true to the appealing roots of rock and not just rebelling against the good music of the last few decades. There are a lot of starving artists and great guitarists out there out there with much more MUSICAL talent than this popular band.
B00004S35Z|5.0|I just revisited this album, which is my favorite Stevie Wonder set.  I forgot how good these songs really are, from beginning to end.  No tracks are too short nor do they last forever.  We know Stevie can be guilty of that from time to time (hello, Songs In The Key Of Life!), but no such thing occurs on FFF. <br />  <br />I think the thing that really took me by storm this time around was the quality of the remastering.  For years I had the old CD reissued by Motown with no liner notes and muddy, airy sound.  Well, I received the remastered version a couple years ago with full liner notes and credits ... but this is the first time I had a chance to really BLAST it while I was on the road on a solo trip.  All the songs sound full and clear with plenty of bass, and every note of every instrument and vocal lick are apparent.  In 1974 Stevie was still singing songs rather than doing acrobatics all the way through them, and his vocals are well-recorded and effective, a perfect fit for his own music.  Listening to Smile Please all the way through to Please Don't Go while driving through hills lined with autumnal-colored trees and silvery skies was an awesome experience, and gave me an even deeper appreciation for this set of songs.  <br />  <br />Creepin' is probably the most widely-known song from this set.  It has been done justice many times by a wide variety of artists, but Stevie's remains the definitive version, a timeless classic. <br />  <br />I would implore anyone who likes Stevie, 70's music, or just good music in general to check this album out!
B000063DFQ|5.0|This album has some of the great Iron Maiden tracks, although I would not consider it their best album. The harmonized rhythms are what really add to these songs as in many other Maiden albums. \\"The Trooper\\" is fast-paced with great harmonization in the melodic theme and excellent vocals; it is one of my favorite Iron Maiden tracks. \\"Die With You Boots On\\" also has some nice vocals and effective twin guitar rhythm, and \\"Flight of Icarus\\" is a classic. While the last three songs are not quite as good in my opinion, this album still rocks to the end.
6304981635|5.0|What else can you say about \\"Enter the Dragon\\"? The movie itself is one of the best I've ever seen. Now add to that all the extra material (interviews, bios, etc). What else could you ask for?
B00004Z459|2.0|I am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 because I'll admit for about a year after it came out I got some pleasure out of it...but that was before I realized what real music is. After I listened to more and more bands from the 70s,80s, and 90s, I found that bands like this don't measure up in musical quality. This band became too popular because its songs have hooks that an inexperienced ear from this generation will at first think is the best thing that ever came out. The bands that last 25 years, like Iron Maiden, have more substance to their songs.
0783235380|3.0|The story is fairly simple. A groom on his way from New York City to Savannah, Georgia gets thrown together with a beautiful but reckless girl. They started out on the same flight but engine problems prevent their departure. They work together to try and find their way south. This provides for some amusement along the way as they get themselves from or mess to another but that is not the real story. The real story is how they fall for each other. This is particularly bad timing since the groom is expected to be a \\"groom\\" the next day. <br /> <br />The two seem mismatched and they are. Even so, each helps the other along. What gets in the way is faithfulness. It discloses nothing secret to say that the groom has second thoughts. Sandra Bullock has that effect on men. The real story is in how those second thoughts are handled.  <br /> <br />This is by no means a great film but it does have its moments. Besides, Sandra is worth watching just for the scenery. <br />
B000063DFN|5.0|This is my favorite of the Iron Maiden albums that I own, largely because I am a big fan of great guitar work. The harmonized rhythms, leads, and solos of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray are very satisfying, and there are enough great riffs to keep a praciticing guitarist busy for a long time. The vocals are heavy but melodic; I especially like the fast-paced verse of the opening track, Aces High, in which the vocals are sung to the same rhythm as the guitars. This album came out a couple years before my time, but I can still relate to it very well. It is a must-have for anyone who wants to experience some of the best of metal or wants to get away from the screamo lyrics and trashy guitar of some of today's popular bands.
0345403959|5.0|If you are one of the many fans of \\"The Belgariad\\" and \\"The Malloreon\\", here is another treat for you. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading those wonderful epic fantasy series, make yourself a favour and read them before tackling \\"Belgarath the sorcerer\\". You can thank me later for introducing you to a wonderful new imaginary world and to likeable characters :)<br /><br />\\"Belgarath the sorcerer\\" starts just where \\"The Malloreon\\" ended, that is the book \\"Seeress of Kell\\". And, strangely enough, it is nothing less than Belgarath's autobiography. As those who have read the series already know, Belgarath is a notoriously lazy sorcerer, probably the least likely person to feel the need to write his story. Unless someone compels him to do so, of course. But to know who or what could do that to an all-powerful sorcerer, you must read this book.<br /><br />What is in it for you?. Well, lots of fun, and the opportunity to know how things really started, from the point of view of one of the main characters in the series. You get to accompany Belgarath from his birth in the small village of Gara, to the fateful day when he met Aldur and became first his pupil and then his disciple. In case you are as curious as me, you will also be grateful to know that this book will allow you to learn more about Belgarath's family, and to live wondrous adventures with him and his friends.<br /><br />Personally, I found the opportunity of \\"living\\" the things I had merely read about in the previous books specially rewarding. The fact that Belgarath's memories span thousands of years gives the reader the opportunity of gaining a good perspective on all the things that happened, thus preparing him to read the previous books in the series in a different way. A warning is in order, though. If you haven't read the previously mentioned books, this book has big-time spoilers, so please don't risk ruining the surprises those series have for you. Do first things first, and read \\"The Belgariad\\" and \\"The Malloreon\\" before \\"Belgarath the sorcerer\\".<br /><br />All in all, I loved reading this book, and I highly recommend it to those who aren't ready to leave the world of Belgarath and his friends. Enjoy it!<br /><br />Belen Alcatriad\\" and \\"The Malloreon\\" before \\"Belgarath the sorcerer\\". <br /> <br />All in all, I loved reading this book, and I highly recommend it to those who aren't ready to leave the world of Belgarath and his friends. Enjoy it! <br /> <br />Belen Alcat
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This was the first real progressive rock album I bought and I was impressed enough to follow the genre and the band farther. John Petrucci is a true virtuoso on the electric guitar, which is manifested in songs such as \\"As I Am\\" and \\"Endless Sacrifice\\"; Petrucci's guitar-playing in this album first inspired me to begin practicing very diligently on my instrument. The other band members also play their instruments with excellent musical expression: the keyboard solos are fantastic and the vocals are not annoying or too unoriginal. I have since bought other Dream Theater albums, but this reamains my favorite because it remains heavy and interesting throughout with a brief and appropriate slowdown on the melodic \\"Vacant\\".
B000092T6M|3.0|I picked up this special extended edition precisely because it had additional Alan Rickman/Geraldine McEwan (Sheriff/Mortianna) footage which I thought improved the movie a good deal. Don't get me wrong. The story still holds up fairly well and is enjoyable as an action movie, but is marred by the stilted acting from Kevin Costner and indeed even from the usually enjoyable Morgan Freeman. The movie was rushed into production and it shows in places. Out of the entire cast, only Rickman, McEwan, and a couple of the Merry Men seem to really be having fun; everyone else is very, very serious and oddly flat. Geraldine McEwan does not get enough credit for her role as the witch, Mortianna. She is clearly having a high old time as is her co-star, Alan Rickman. Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham is totally evil and completely mad and yet comes across as oddly sympathetic. He and McEwan are definitely the best reasons to watch this film. I didn't find the DVD extras that compelling. If you want to watch the commentaries, stick with the one that features the author, Pen Densham, Chris Slater, and Morgan Freeman. Kevin Reynolds (the director) and Kevin Costner also do a separate commentary, but they are so self-congratulatory and full of themselves that I just wanted to reach through the screen and strangle them.
B000001FOS|5.0|This is the first CD I bought of Yngwie Malmsteens and I am very impressed. He is an awesome guitarist and proof that you can have both speed and melody even while improvising solos. \\"Rising Force\\" has a great rhthym guitar part and the break into the first blazing solo of the song is stunning. I also particularly enjoyed the instrumental \\"Bite the Bullet\\" for its expressing soloing over almost no backing instruments and the classical guitar sections of \\"Dreaming\\". While Turner is a talented vocalist I don't have much taste for this type of 80's glam rock vocals, but it did not ruin the guitar work of Malmsteen for me.
B00004Z400|5.0|I remember the time when this album came out. It was the summer of 2000, and I was ready to give up on rock as it was. The sound of nu metal, once promising, was going down the mainstream drain, when the genre torch was handed to people like Fred Durst; it seemed for me at the time that the only hope was Deftones. This band from Sacramento was never my first choice when it came to rock. I always thought that Around the fur was an album with a lot of the right elements, but it was focused on one, heavyness. Nevertheless, \\"Be quiet and drive\\" is one of their best songs, \\"if only their next album would be more like this\\", I thought. The day before White Pony came out, I was really excited, I couldn't wait, for me it was like, \\"Either Deftones save rock, or I'm moving on\\", it was that crucial. I didn't even wanted to listen to their first single. The day came, I bought it, put it on my car stereo, \\"Feiticeira\\" started, I thought, \\"still heavy, still Deftones\\", but then the magic started, \\"Digital Bath\\"\\", my jaw dropped, the clock stop, I wanted everybody to listen to this song. I played it again. \\"Which one is the single?\\" I tought. \\"Change in the house of flies\\", played it, I almost cried. And from there it was just pure genius. \\"Street Carp.\\", \\"RX Queen\\", \\"Teenager\\", \\"Knife Party\\", and \\"Passenger\\", oh my god, with Keenan; at that point, they did not needed anybody but them on that record.  <br />White Pony defined my taste in music, my lifestyle,they way I approached music, etc. I remember I was talking to a friend about starting a band two weeks before White Pony came out, and after listening to it, I called him right away and started writing music and lyrics, he was a fan too, and he was as inspired as I was.  <br />Deftones raised the bar pretty high on this album, so it was no surprise to me when they decided to went back to their heavy roots on their follow up and Chino started wrapping up his side project Team Sleep's debut. I don't know if they ever will or will try to top White Pony, but I know is going to be freaking hard.
B00005LOUQ|4.0|This was an excellent movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  HOWEVER, there are several missing scenes!  I always thought movies were cut for TV and the DVDs had the entire movie.  I saw scenes on TV that were not on this DVD.  I was very disappointed and a little aggravated.
B00006EXL5|5.0|this is one of the best CD's I have ever heard in my life. Please, go out and buy it. It's kinda better than Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge if you ask me. The lyrics are by far some of the best i've ever heard. Please buy this CD, if you know what is good for you..
B00005JNJV|5.0|I went to see this film the nite it opened in theaters and I was very impressed! I kind of had the feeling the film would be good since the producers got alot of the ideas for this movie from Frank Miller's \\"Batman: Year One\\" comic series. Thanks to Miller, comic books enjoy the popularity they have today since he injected real-life elements into comic book character's lives. In the case of Batman, Miller was able to reintroduce Batman as an obsessed crime-fighter like Batman's creator, Bob Kane, made him. This version of Batman is a reflection of Miller's ingenuity and towers above Burton's film since it has all of the elements of what a good movie should have: a believeable story-line, great special effects and action scenes, solid acting and good chemistry between the cast. Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne and I like the performances of Neeson, Crane, Freeman and Hauer too. Katie Holmes was good and, in a way, its too bad that she won't be returning for the film's sequel. When I saw Burton's films, I felt they tried too hard to be like comic books. This film, however, approaches Batman in a much more realistic manner. I can't wait for the sequels!
B000002UA0|4.0|I really like this entire album because it is so different from the later Floyd releases.  It has touches of 60s psychedelia and displays the emergence of the band that changed how the world listened to rock.  Very weird stuff on here, but none the less great for a first try.  Syd Barrett displays his genius on every song.  My personal favorites are, Astronomy Domine, Lucifer Sam, Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk, Matilda Mother, and Bike. <br /> <br />A must have for any Pink Floyd fan!
B000068FUS|5.0|Have you ever noticed that there have been a couple of albums (and then CD's) that came through your life that you handled differently?   <br />Those few that you treated with a reverence that you never used with most of the rest of your music collection. <br />You didn't have to think about it or try, you were just automatically careful to only touch the edges, and you always had to blow off any traces of dust before you slid them back in the cover.  <br /> <br />I'm trying to think of the few that I've treated like that. There weren't many. I know Gold & Platinum was one. <br /> <br />I treat \\"Southern Rock Opera\\" like that.  <br />Same reverence. <br /> <br />Listen to these three songs: <br />\\"72 This Highway's Mean\\" <br />\\"Shut Up and Get on the Plane\\" <br />\\"Greenville to Baton Rouge\\" <br />And then notice how careful you are when you take it out of your stereo. <br />I guess that explains everything.
0553802534|5.0|This book took off like a rocketship,very fast paced. I have never read a lisa gardner novel before. I tell you this much it won't be the last. My next step is to start from her first novel and work my down to her latest work which comes out next year I believe.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|The movie is great - old good Clint is on the top as usual. And DVD is also very very good. A lot of interesting features. I'm glad to have this disc!
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I played Final Fantasy VII pretty much from the moment it was released.  I fell in love the first time I played it, and I still play it regularly to this day.  When I heard about Advent Children, I was really excited.  I finally saw a copy my friend had, and I couldn't believe it.  The sheer beauty of it was amazing.  I loved it almost as much as the game.  The fight scenes were amazing, and the adaptions of the characters were great.  Now, only fans of the game will enjoy this, any others will be lost by the story in the first few scenes.  Like an earlier review said, this is a love letter to Final Fantasy VII fans.  If you haven't played the game, but want to see the movie, do not ask for an review of the game, your friend will probably lose you, and you'll hate the movie when you see it, so either rent it or pick up a copy of your own.  Now, the reason that I didn't give Advent Children Five stars is because t was missing something in lines of story.  It just didn't capture my imagination as the game did.  Still, It's a movie worthy for any Final Fantasy VII fan.
B00002E224|5.0|Richard Linklater has got an ear for real-world dialogue.  His characters don't speak in a hyper-cool, overly-stylized dialect that tangentially (if entertainingly) related to English, like the cons of \\"The Usual Suspects\\" or any of Quentin Tarantino's characters.  Nope.  Linklater's characters engage in ordinary, yet intelligent banter that makes them almost unnervingly familiar.  And invariably endearing.   <br /> <br />In his earlier movie, \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" Linklater followed around a bunch of high school students on the last day (and night) of school back in the 1970s.  Through a huge cast and an antiplot that careened from character to character linked virtaully only by their conversations, Linklater created the delightful sense that the audience was going back in time to their own high school years and seeing old friends. <br /> <br />In \\"Before Sunrise,\\" the plot is not nearly as universal as \\"the last night of the school year.\\"  Ethan Hawke is Jesse, a slacker-ish American riding the Eurorail to Vienna.  Julie Delpy is Celine, a young French woman heading to school at the Sorbonne.  United by a distaste for overbearing Germans on the train, they strike up a conversation that lasts for the next 14 hours.  When the train stops in Vienna, Jesse convinces Celine to help him spend time in Vienna before his flight to the States the next morning.  Intrigued by both the man and the offer, Celine agrees. <br /> <br />What follows is an extended dialogue that belongs right up there with the great screenplays for romantic comedies, including \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"Shakespeare in Love.\\"  Wandering from locale to locale, Jesse and Celine bump into numerous colorful Viennese characters.  But the focus of the movie remains firmly on their conversations with each other as they explore their mutual hopes, dreams, fears and desires, all spiced with that wonderful special something that inhabits every conversation when you know you're talking to Miss Right (or Mr., as the case may be). <br /> <br />Hawke and Delpy give virtuoso performances in this movie, as their deliveries and silences perfectly capture the dance of awkwardness, delight, and surprise as they continually discover each other.  Similar characters, yet distinct, they have much in common and also have many unique traits.  Given distinct yet intelligent voices, Jesse and Celine are as fascinating at the closing scenes as they were at the outset -- which is an achievement, considering how much talking has been going on. <br /> <br />Vienna and its sundry haunts play a vital role in the movie, as the melancholy beauty of this old city provides the perfect backdrop for a relationship that may or may not only last 14 hours.   <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Before Sunrise\\" may be one of those rare movies that is better enjoyed at home than in a theater.  Very few \\"laugh-out-loud\\" moments, numerous long stretches of conversation, and several meaningful silences make \\"Before Sunrise\\" an excellent movie to enjoy on the couch by yourself or with a loved one, for there is much to think about.  I have rarely cared as much for two characters in a movie as I did for Celine and Jesse . . . the end of the movie leaves one anxious to learn more about both.  Here's looking forward to \\"Before Sunset\\"!   <br /> <br />A must for the film library.
B000002JR8|4.0|PANTERA - Far Beyond Driven.  -  This is by far, my favorite Pantera album if not one of my favorite Metal Albums of the 90's.  This album had some classics: Becoming, I'm Broken, 5 Minutes Alone.  But more so this album had so many amazing metal songs that were more underground classics: Strength Beyond Strength, Slaughtered, Shedding Skin (May be my favorite Pantera Song), and Use my Third Arm.  And to close off this brilliant album is a good cover of Sabbath's Planet Caravan. (Which sadly never made the Nativity in Black Tributes: However their version of Electric Funeral on there is great!)  This album may be overrated by many die-hard Pantera fans as the greatest metal album ever made... But, underrated by people who hate Pantera.  Honestly what person, who likes metal, can fairly give this a 1 STAR.   -4.5 STARS       -Now as far as the conflict between Pantera fans and \\"Pantera Hater\\" here is my 2 cents.  First things first when musicians die it is no more tragic than if anyone else dies.  Dime will always be remembered as a great guitarist but lets not go overboard.... He was far from a god.  Also I'd prefer to remember him from his Pantera days and not Damaged Plan (which was far from his finest hour) He did have a great style... although not overly original from a guitar perspective it was quite original from a metal perspective.     Opinions are like... Well everyone knows what their like....  Truthfully the man is dead so show a little respect....  And you don't have nothing nice to say, kindly shut your mouth.  In fairness, stop praising him like a god!  He's just another cat that could play the guitar.  Enjoy this CD for what is:  Classic Pantera at the top of their game.      IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:  \\"Was this review helpful?\\"

B00005JLKN|4.0|After I watched \\"Manhunter\\" the so called \\"Better\\" of the two movies, I decided to rent red Dragon. I thought Manhunter was okay-good, I kind of got bored along with some other faults but it was nowhere near bad. I waited a while to rent Red Dragon because I thought it was going to be a needless, exact replica of Manhunter. Boy, was I wrong. Once I really got into Red Dragon I loved it. It was compelling, dark, and once I got into it, very different and new to me. Most people wouldn't give this 5 stars, myself I waved between the 4 and 5, but some reviews say this is a very needless, bad, remake which it isn't. Sure the story, some scenes, and characters are the same but most of the scenes and actors are alot better than manhunter's. Manhunter was a little too 80s and not dark enough for me, Red Dragon is so different. The last 45 minutes completely differ than that of the previous movie. If you saw manhunter in the 80s and loved it obviously you'll probably hate dragon. People who have not I strongly recomend Red Dragon. Its the stronger and better of the two movies.
B00005JO0J|4.0|Having never seen the show I made sure that I read enough to know a bit about the characters and the universe they live in to understand what was going on. I loved it! I'm a big sci-fi fan and watch most stuff that has a vaguely interesting premise (not sure how I missed Firefly when it was on in that case). Anyway I thought the film was well acted considering the absence of any well known film actors though sitting there trying to work out what I had seen Jayne in before. I'm now waiting to buy this when it comes out and would recomend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi and a good action story. <br /> <br />Julia
0393317552|5.0|This book was an excellent value. It should be a reading requirement for all college students enrolled in world history courses. It is informative and interesting.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This long awaited CD X&Y is a cure for my gastric distress.  When I first hit \\"play,\\" the intestinal fluids began to flow in the most soothing natural way.  I especially like the song about meeting a polar bear and sheep and making them all die of boredom.  Chris Martin is a lyrical genius and let's make him our polar bear soverign of white icy meleancholy.  As my intestines began their regenerative glory, this album whished the bile to and fro, the perfect inspiration for my bowels.  This is some of the very best enema music I have yet heard.  I am a 78 year old grandmother but I think Chris Martin is hot.  He came over last night and let me tell you he is such a gentleman in the bedroom.  Thanks Chris from all the grannies who love the foulest of corporate rock.
0525948023|5.0|I have been a life-long spiritual seeker (one of those seekers/never-finders that Eckhart refers to - rightly).  This book is absolutely marvelous and stunningly practical.  I find Eckhart's orientation toward spiritual teachings to be refreshingly direct and free of traditional dogma, yet touching on all the perennial threads that are the underpinnings of all spiritual teachings.  I have great respect for his ability to approach ideas and concepts that are effectively ineffable and communicate them well and with a gentle and encouraging invitation to try them out for yourselves.   <br /> <br />And that is where I find his teachings have the greatest strength and potential to improve immediate, personal, and eventually collective, lives - by trying out the teachings and practices that he suggests.   <br /> <br />In particular, I am very grateful for the emphasis he places on the power of watching and witnessing our own thoughts - and how that small, but profound act can begin to permit us to view our thoughts and life-patterns in a different way.  This, to me, is a deeply liberating concept.  <br /> <br />Read his books, or better, buy some of his audio works.  I found them to be more powerful because some quality came through the voice that doesn't on the printed page.  <br /> <br />There is goodness to be had here.
0743454537|4.0|I picked this book up at Target and wasn't sure how I would feel about reading it. I don't like reading things with concrete storylines... I like books that aren't predictable. But for some reason, I felt that I had to pick this book up and give it a try.  <br /> <br />\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" uses a different format than most other books - narration is split between the members of the family, the lawyer and the guardian ad litem. Each \\"view\\" is divided as a chapter. To further emphasize the narrators' differences and uniqueness, the fonts for each chapter are different. At the beginning, this makes your eyes go all wonky, but it doesn't take long for your eyes to adjust to the constant switching. <br /> <br />This book touches on an issue that I've never thought about before: having a baby for the soul purpose of saving another. Throughout the book, I felt anchored in Anna's shoes. I couldn't understand why her parents would possibly make her sacrifice her own body so her sister could live.  <br /> <br />I did not, however, agree with the ending. It was abrupt and painful, but very predictable. The obvious ending of the book was chosen. It was like after 412 pages, Jodi said \\"Ok, I'm done thinking on this book. What's the most likely ending?\\" I think the book would have been better without the charitable ending. I wanted an honest ending to this book - not a flappy, fluffy \\"Expected\\" ending. The ending could have been more drawn out and alot better.
B000AYEIZY|3.0|Why oh why Messrs. Bruce, Baker & Clapton did not play \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\", \\"I feel free\\" and one of my all time  Cream favourites, \\"Strange Brew\\".I wish Clapton could play note for solo on \\"Badge\\" which on the original sounds sweet and short. <br />The DVD could at least include ( as an alternate takes) their 1993 one time peformance during their induction to R n R Hall Of Fame. I am terribly dissappointed that the producers of the DVD chhosed to include alternate takes of the same songs from different nights.I hope they duly take note of this if they intend to produce another DVD of the Cream's impending three night gigs in New York later this month. <br />The Cream's versions of \\"Stormy Monday\\" and the 37 years later version of \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" is worth the price of the DVD.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD has been reviewed numerous times on this site, so I'll be brief. OK Computer is quite simply the best rock album since Harvest. Better than Ten, better than Rumors, better than Exile on Main Street. THIS IS THE ONLY RADIOHEAD CD I OWN. I find them a bit tedious on most of their CD's, although invariably, there is always a song that reveals their potential as a band. However, on this CD, their potential is very much realized. Trust me, it will be a valued asset in your music library.
6303011012|5.0|As in many videos I have viewed the VHS version is on par with the DVD version. I am watching the VHS right now and it is just thrilling. It has the most dramatic footage ever filmed of Yanni in concert with some music not included on the album. Not only is this video excellent in quality, but it is also very affordable in the quality used product market. Everyone can have a musical delight at a very affordable cost. Enjoy!
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|this band im not really inot but this cd is ok , but y is in it number 1 on the death metal chart, this is more like hard rock than death metal, i mean cmon. This cd is more for fans of shadows fall and staind. but this is not death metal
B00006FR47|5.0|This is the reason why I liked Chicago from the beginning. The blend of jazz, rock great vocalization and creatividy make that musical concept an everlasting one.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|i tried to listen to this band when i first them but im not into them because they have no talent to begin with, maybe a few good riffs here and there with some screams but nothing orginal. I have to say i saw there music video on mtv and it is one of the worst videos ive seen. this band is selling out for sure.
B00005JO0J|1.0|Serenity is a glorified Battlefield Earth. Whedon is the L. Ron Hubbard to the more zealous browncoat's church of Scientology. Ironically, for all the browncoat bashing of Lucas, Gene Roddenberry, and the fans of other genre franchises-their leader, Whedon, wants to be the very people his followers viciously insult and attack. <br /> <br /> <br />Whedon doesn't want to be Kurosawa, or Cronenberg, or Kubrick, because none of the truly gifted film makers have achieved the pop culture icon status that the Spielberg and Lucases of the world have. Whedon wants to be the star, the icon, the visionary. He's just as self-important and pretentious as Chris Carter. He's similar to Steven Sommers, the writer/director of the craptastic \\"Mummy remakes\\". Writers and directors who grew up during this era of film tend to lack originality and geniune artistic vision, which is why they are constantly ripping off Spielberg and Lucas. <br /> <br />Which is, needless to say, also ironic since Spielberg and Lucas were also ripping off the truly great directors and writers in film history-the difference is, of course, Lucas and Spielberg freely admit when they borrowed or stole-and for all their <br />faults, (and they have many) Spielberg and Lucas have talent and vision-even if it has become muddled by technology and the 'yes' men they surround themselves with. <br /> <br /> <br />Perhaps I am bias. Perhaps I'm giving Lucas more credit than he deserves. But I'd rather sit through the crappiest moments of the Phantom Menace than watch the best moments of Serenity or Firefly. I mean, at least Lucas don't pretend its high <br />art.
B0007XT7V8|4.0|I bought this CD for one song and ended up liking most of them. The main thread of the CD is that the songwriter got burned by his significant other. A little more uplifting songs would have been nice. But overall, I am enjoying the music - some rock, some ballads. Pretty consistent sound.  I will look forward to their next one.
0790733226|5.0|`Contact' has evolved into one of those movies that people either seem to love or hate.  This reviewer loves it.<br /><br />`Contact' is a fresh story, and is particularly great for those who enjoy their sci-fi light : science fiction movies that don't require laser guns and spaceships, etc.  Its subject is thought provoking, its characters are memorable and well portrayed, and its overall presentation is top-notch.<br /><br />The events following the signal's detection are spot on, as director Robert Zemeckis captures brilliantly the reaction and events that would most likely follow an event of this magnitude.  I view what he presents not as a swipe at humanity, but as a snapshot of its current state.  Religious zealots to scam artists to a media feeding frenzy are presented here, not to mention rather accurately and believably.  The political, religious, social, and moral fallout of such an event are also presented here extremely well.<br /><br />The movie's climax (Ellie's final destination) is not only satisfying, but also intentionally ambiguous, forcing the viewer to think about what they have just seen, and where she might actually have been.  For the sake of anyone who hasn't seen it, I'm being as vague as possible, so as not to ruin anything.<br /><br />It's probably redundant to say that Jodie Foster was fantastic, but I'll say it anyway.  She is in a category by herself, in terms of acting talent, and she is supported by a great cast featuring Tom Skerritt, Matthew McConaughey, David Morse (a terrific actor in his own right), Angela Bassett, John Hurt, and James Woods, among others.  Also featured are many well-known media figures who had cameos in the movie, adding a level of authenticity to the film.<br /><br />`Contact' definitely deserved more attention at Oscar time the year it was released, and why it didn't receive more, I can't say.  Suffice it to say that this is a movie that, no matter what you believe spiritually, has the ability to either force you to question that belief, or it will re-enforce your beliefs stronger than ever.itually, has the ability to either force you to question that belief, or it will re-enforce your beliefs stronger than ever.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|\\"In the settlement of New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's investigation of Sony BMG Music Entertainment last week, the ugly side of an industry was exposed -- again. Sony e-mails revealed what Spitzer called a 'pervasive' practice of payola, or bribes for radio airplay.\\" That quote was from a story that broke on August 9, 2005 by NPR's Neda Ulaby, and one of the albums cited by Spitzer's investigation was this Franz Ferdinand record. Any album that had to bribe it's way onto the charts deserves to have the crap kicked out of it. This is what I would refer to as \\"canned music.\\" My artistic standards are a little more lofty than this. Sorry, but in spite of its bright moments, I refuse to give this album any stars. This record MUST be punished. The hell with major labels. They should burn in hell.
B00005JNZP|5.0|Everything is Illuminated is a fantastic movie. Elijah Wood is great as the American who travels to the Ukrain to learn about his Grandfathers past. He is quirky because he collects nearly everything.<br /><br />The character actors in the Ukrain really make this an outstanding film. The Tour Guides that show Elijah Woods character around are fantastic.<br /><br />The film deals with a serious subject, and there are alot of moving elements to the film. But at the same time there are little quirky funny parts that are just as amazing. Liev Schreiber did an outstanding job on this film.
B000059XUO|5.0|The Crow is one of the coolest movies I have ever had the pleasure to see.  <br />You know how Goth, black clothes, and creepy Halloween make-up looks cool but very few people can pull it off with looking like wanabee dorks? No idea what I'm talking about? Forget it.  <br />The crow is the cool idea that if you find true love but get brutally murdered a crow brings you back to avenge the wrong. You can dress up Goth and tear fother muckers apart for being the drunk, crack head, heroin, loser, thieves, and killers they are.  <br />Brandon Lee was born for this role. He is and always will be the best crow. His style, charisma, looks, the stunts and fight scenes it's all there and duct tapes your peekers to the screen.  <br />The music in the crow is perfect for the feel of the movie cool songs by My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult, Cure, and Rage.  <br />NUDITY: You get some quick flashes of breasts a hot Asian chick's round dumper, and that's it. But you don't watch the crow for T&A. <br />It's about action and there's plenty. The fight scenes are actually fairly brief but powerful and satisfying. You'll adore watching the crow hunt down shred his enemies.  <br />In order to make a good action flick you absolutely must have a great villain(s) (like Darth Vader, The Joker form the first Batman). The villains in the Crow are all memorable and good. Smart and evil. `I ain't Skank, Skanks over there, Skanks dead\\". \\"Fire it up! Fire it up!\\" Great lines from the movie <br />The crow is a beautiful movie to watch. It captures the dark gloomy antihero feel.  <br />I recommend it check it out. <br /> <br />

B00005JNTX|5.0|Review form the Darkside <br />What I liked, plenty of violence. Chopped off heads, tons of gunshots, blown off hands, blown off heads, mucho sadistic torture, no mercy in the violence department. Stretched the R rating to the limit here. <br />Hot women. I don't fricken know how but this little flick got away with totally turning women into horny sex slaves. Refreshing and very nice. I don't find empowered self-righteous chicks entertaining. All the babes looked totally wacka doo hot. You don't get any full frontal but you get a couple very perfect (almost too perfect) juicy melons. And fellas WOW some insanely perfect rear ends. I can't explain or put into words how flawless these buttocks where. But you'll know when you see the movie. <br />The story was brutal, basically it's about well...sin. Bad people doing bad things. Mix in a couple cool dudes with consciences and a death wish for your two protagonists and you got the story.  <br />You get an all-star cast so the acting is all top notch. Even Brittney Murfy who I find creepy and freaky is very cool in Sin City. The dialog is clearly straight form the graphic novel so it seems unnatural at times but you get use to it and dig it after a while. <br />The special effect and CGI are everywhere I love that shiz so I dug it and reveled in the lush artwork and city scrapes.  <br />The best character in this black and white fistfight of a movie was Marv played by Mickey Rourke. He was totally tough and likeable for a drunk, twisted, thug, loser, horny, smoke pipe, sadistic murderer. Kind of like John Travolta and Sam Jackson in pulp fiction when you first saw the movie, before they became played out and old.  <br />Sin City is very comic bookish, violent, sexy, and will have you glued to the screen for 2+hours and wishing it wouldn't end.  <br />I recommend it check it out.  <br />
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|It is in my opinion that this movie was horrible. The purpose of it was to make fun of other horror films but they did not do a good job. In fact it was stupid. Who wants to waist 8 dollars on a movie ticket to see people act like characters they have already seen-- no-one. This movie can be summed up in about two words-- a joke! I give this film 1 star because that is the most it deserves.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|I drag my girl to the movies to see this flick. I hate Gwyneth Paltrow But I like Jude Law and this movies is suppose to be like Star Wars right?  <br />Wrong! <br />You know what there is and will always be only one Star Wars ok. Shizt! <br />First off this movie is shot through some flickin weird blurry assh filter. It's extremely irritating at first but you get use to it. <br />The dialog is corny stupid 1920s bozo talk. But the technology is super science fiction advanced. What meathead thought of that dynamic dual? Some disconnected Hollywood privileged heb.  <br />Beware of the tin man from wizard of Oz. The main villains. WTF! <br />NUDITY: Nothing, nada, zippo. (It is PG) <br />You do get a couple cool airplane dogfights but stupid fat head Gwyneth Paltrow is in the plane in her idiot 1920s trench coat and hat. It ruins the scenes. Sky Captain Judd Law has one decent fight with a bug-eyed assassin but that's it.  <br /> This movie is super corny and painful to watch. Understand I like a good science fiction flick. It doesn't have to be dripping with sex or have over the top bloodshed. (I love Star Wars.) But please skip this cheesy drip bag. <br />
0517548232|5.0|This is the easiest book that the average person can use to grasp economics, and in particular, the economics of all groups of people over an extended time period - ie: government policies.  <br /> <br />The book is a single, simple, practical example, followed by a series of examples of how governments break with the lesson and the outcome of doing so. It is a simple lesson, followed by simple examples, for people who have no experience with economics, or those who find the mathematical approach in college either overwhelming or irrelevant. <br /> <br />For the average person, there may not need to be much else one needs to consider when weighing matters of import as a voter. <br /> <br />Some of the reviews that are negative seem to express a dissatisfaction with the structure of the argument as being polemic. But, this is either nonsensical or a misunderstanding.  When one wishes to illustrate the impact of a single idea, and the consequences of abusing it, and to do so on a vast scale, against those things which we assume daily to be successful, then one can choose to be Adam Smith, and drag the reader through tortuous detail with which he is unfamiliar, or one can paint broad debates, with which one is quite familiar, and which can be applied to one's daily experiences.   <br /> <br />This is simply the strategy one uses to communicate such ideas to a population that requests such an approach. It is not that such ideas cannot be conveyed through more detailed means, or that such a thing has not been done by other authors elsewhere, such as Hayek, Mises and Schumpater. <br /> <br />For those on the left, who are in a long term campaign to destroy individual property rights, and those who deny that there is a necessary ignorance in individuals, groups or institutions, in a complex division of knoweldge, production and labor, this entire line of thinking appears either faulty or disingenuous.  But it is not only honest, but true. <br /> <br />For those that thinkgovernment policy over the past 100 years has been successful, it has been successful in the same way that an inheritance given to a college student, allows the student to spend down the work of his predecessors.  Money is not the only capital that must be earned and produced, so is knowledge and especially that knowledge which one cannot gain of one's own accord, but only through the experience of those who came before him.  In particular, his family and culture. <br /> <br />It took thousands of years to develop the capital-store of knowledge in European civilization, of which we are a part, and this knowledge resides in very simple ideas that we are surrounded by every day. This knowledge is a set of principles by which we can exist and prosper in an ever-expanding division of knowledge and labor, producing more and more complex goods and services in a larger and larger population, most of whom do not know each other, and who may not even know the end consumer, or what use their goods are put to or why. In a world of this complexity, we are necessarily ignorant, we must face an uncertain and ever changing future.  <br /> <br />It is expressly NOT a community of similar people all of whom know each other and share equally in production and it's results - which is the philosophy of a village or tribe. It is a simple primitive economic strategy for use by those who know little, and have few options.  <br /> <br />This evolution is the process of making peasants into princes. It is the process of transforming primitive social capitalism, which involves economic units of villages and families -- who do the same thing repeatedly and are certain of it, into modern western capitalism which involves economic units of families and individuals -- who do different things all the time, and are uncertain of everything. It makes all men into entrepreneurs. And in doing so, makes all men service all others, even if he does not know them.  <br /> <br />No man who has risen from poverty by building a business through discipline and hard work in the productive economy (versus the political, religious or academic economy - which are consumptive) and who would have his childen do the same, does so without learning this lesson.  <br /> <br />When a government prints money or redistributes money, it interferes with the process by which the generations in the population learn those habits traditions, ethics and behaviors that allowed them to raise from one economic strata in the division of knowledge and labor, into another.  A loan to start a business is one thing, for it is the same as financing an education.  A gift to make your life easier is something else altogether. It is giving a man a fish, not teaching him how to.  <br /> <br />This process works from the opposite direction as well.  Even charity, which was the material obligation of those who were wealthy before government interference in the economy, and the traditional obligations and social pressure for the wealthy has been eroded. <br /> <br />In the act of redistribution, the goverment indirectly manufactures economic ignorance in it's populace. Hazlitt does not say this directly, but he still says it. <br /> <br />Our economy fell apart in the 1960's and 1970's, with what in the future will be called a great depression of the 1970's.  It has been wealthy enough to tolerate this behavior since the 1980's, largely because of technological innovation and the prosperity that came from the competitive need to adopt it.  But our position in the world is changing.  European redistribution of wealth and social programs is failing now, and will of demographic necessity fail in the next two decades.  It will fail here as well.  Why such ponzi scheme's are comprehensible to the investment community, and not to the body politic will be a question to answer for sociologists for years to come. <br /> <br />The peasants need to develop trust in one another, need to earn that trust in one another. They need to become comfortable with an uncertain future where they cannot understand all that happens in the vast universe of human cooperation, and to think longer term than their traditions tell them.  And they must save.  Because the future is uncertain in either case, and the repetitive certainty of the peasant philosophy was always an illusion. The had little to learn and learned little. There was little change and they changed little.  They knew those close to them and knew others little. People starved. They died in ignorance and poverty. In a division of knowledge and labor, everything is so cheap, and increasingly so, that they  instead, prosper and populations increase accordingly. And the price we all pay for this luxury is constant change, constant learning, and psychological uncertainty. <br /> <br />There are means by which such inter-generational economic knoweldge can be imparted to a population, and by which the people can be compelled to adopt it despite the fact that they do not understand it.  One can use religion and social ostricization as did the calvinist protestants and european jews, one can use ideological government by way of force and violence, as did the communists, socialists and facists. These methods remove choice from the individual and prescribe how we should act. But one can also achieve this end by using property rights alone, and a judiciary who does not prescribe anything at all, but only resolves differences in conflict over property, and nothing else is necessary. No politicians, prophets, intellectuals, sages. The population learns to serve on another without direction and prescription. This is the lesson. <br /> <br />This is a conflict between princes and peasants.  It is between property rights, individual responsibility for himself, savings, entrepreneurship and courage in the face of uncertainty, versus communal property, perpetual dependence, poverty and the comfort in the certainty of that future.   <br /> <br />Wecan all be princes of countries of one, or peasants in a country of billions. Hazlitt tells us the one lesson we need to know if we would all be princes. <br /> <br /> <br />

No just kidding. Or am I? <br />Sahara is a remake? I think so, big fluting surprise.  <br />A dastardly evil plot (pollute the earth to make money, now what sicko would do that in real life) is discovered by mucho sexy black haired raveness and saintly doctor Penelope Cruz. Treasure hunter McConaughey and his dufuss sidekick Steve Zahn decide to risk their lives to help Cruz and save the world. I know McConaughey is working for pu$$y rate to be paid in full at the end by Cruz, but I don't know what Zahn's angle is. <br />This is a big budget cheesy Indiana Jones wanabee stealing ideas from National Treasure or vise versa. It's a good way to kill 90 minutes on a weeknight if Law and Order is a rerun. But I would stay clear. <br />NO NUDITY HERE. Just Cruz's big beautiful Latin eyes and supple peaches under her skintight wife beater.  Lots of unbelievable fist fights, chase scenes, and boat wars, camel riding, and lots of silly shiiieet getting blow to fricken bits. Did I metion McConaughey and Zahn have super bullet proof powers in this flick. No matter how many machine gun wilding Africans shoot at them they are invincible. It's insane. And just wait till the end it's a bonzer of and ending. My house smelled like cheeeese for a week after this steamer.  <br />Judge this book by its cover and stay the fuke away. <br />
B000777J2S|5.0|When I first listened to Antony and the Johnsons I wasn't sure if I liked them or not. Usually when it takes me time to like music, I end up really liking it. I think Antohony Hegarty's voice is amazing. Somewhere between Tim Buckley and Aaron Neville. His tone is really clear. The band recently won the Mercury Music Award in Britain and is appreciated by the likes of Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson. Enough said.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Perspective is the by product of age, and age is the byproduct of time. I've read all the reviews, some excellent, some not so good. A good many reviews complain about Crem not being \\"Like they were.\\" It would be nice if Amazon requested each poster to indicate his or her age (while I'm on this, Amazon should include \\"spell check\\", some reviews are tough on the eyes. Myself, I'm 52 in June 2005. I was 14 when i first heard \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", that was my introduction tho Cream. I've played in rock bands on and off since age 15. The Perspective Thing: Nothing is like it used to be. Even myself, just a \\"local amateur bass player\\" I don't play like I did at 15. Not that I can't. Just don't choose to. It just suppose it's age. And these guys are in their 60's. The fact that they played the Royal Albert Hall (and now MSG) is like an unexpected gift from an old friend. They have compensated for their age, and I'm sure, after 37 years of playing in many groups, their playing styles have evolved. Cream are simply playing as they can. Can you do the things you did (at the same intensity) you did 37 years ago? Or even 20 years ago? My thinking is they CAN play like they did before, but it make more sense in their 60's to play as they do now. In the Interview, Jack Bruce says they tried the Marshall stacks and Gibson EB-0, but it just didn't work for them. Again, Time & Perspective. The DVD is one of those events you thought would never happen, and now a lot of people are finding fault. Before the reunion, everyone wished for a reunion. Well, here it is! Love it for the fact there is a reunion. <br />The DVD production is excellent, the segues between the nights are tastefully done, the 5.5 sound is phenomenal (will they redo the original albums in 5.5?)and the overall experience par none. Highly recommended. They played that way then; they play this way now. But it's still Cream! Buy this DVD!!!

B00000J2PH|5.0|It would be pretty stupid for me to try and write the history of \\"Tapestry\\" expecting a lot of folks to read what most already know that this is about the best 70's album ever recorded. Put aside all the long hair hard rock hippie garbage and all the top 40 and Motown mum-bo jum-bo and push through the pot smoke looking for something with some substance from this time period and \\"Tapestry\\" will float to the top of an era like sweet cream on fresh milk. Being a hard core Hillbilly fan this was the first modern record I heard in 71 that I was able to apperciate. These songs by Miss Carole King are ageless and about some of the best stuff to be put on an LP. I will go as far to say that this record changed the path of music. Most of us who were teens in the 60's and early 70's had nothing to chose from with most music being drug ridden dung (unless you were into Western Swing & Bluegrass like me). This music gave young people something to really hear without just hearing screaming guitars, banging base drums and loose lipped lyrics. Enough said this is the best CD if one is searching for 70's classics without all the birdseed. If they are truthful I'll bet that this album is also the favoriate of many dopers from those days...crap on the dope all you really need is a good stereo to enjoy this timeless classics. <br /> <br />                          \\"Enjoy\\" Joe Kopeck
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|ok. first things first.  if you heard of a7x through the radio and city of evil, i don't consider you a true fan.  another thing is that this is an entirely different album with screaming, and i guess more hardcore in general, not teh metal junk they're playing now (not saying that city of evil is bad at all, but out of their album's it's their worst).  This cd is my favorite cd.  A7X is insane.  they are the best band around.  Waking the Fallen is proof.  Looking at Unholy Confessions, Clairvoyant Disease, Eternal Rest, and just every song, you have to say to yourself, \\"they are f*****g amazing.\\"  in my opinion, if you like a7x because you hear Bat Country on the radio, stick with city of evil.  you won't like this album or sounding the seventh trumpet (which is such a sick cd as well) <br /> <br />that's it.  basically, when you buy this. sit back and prepare to be amazed.

The movie is breathtakingly beautiful and detail oriented.  Everything was though of.  The incredible backdrops, the scenery, the props, all of them intriguing and exquisite.<br /><br />I have never been a Brad Pitt fan, but this movie makes him seem almost unearthly, out of this world gorgeous.  His acting and appearance are both magnificent and left me breathless for a couple of seconds.  Claire Forlani definetly fits the \\"Susan\\" part and is incredibly radiant and beautiful in this film.  Her eyes are so blue and hypnotic.  If death were to fall in love with someone it would definetly be her.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins meets up with death in the body of a young man(Brad Pitt) whom Susan met earlier that day.  Of course, death takes the young man's body in order for it to understand human nature.  Death takes a \\"Holiday/Vacation\\" and uses Hopkins's as his guide to show him the way to human life and nature.  He uses Hopkins's character as his guide because according to him he is an \\"exceptional human\\" and has achieved a great deal.  During this time death falls in love with Susan, Hopkins's daughter. Though, time is running short and Hopkins must make amends with his family and business before saying good-bye to this world.  Death also has to leave and say good-bye to Susan.

Jon Anderson is also a great lyricist and the track \\" I'll Find My Way Home\\" is one of the best songs that I have ever heard for its intricate yet not over the top lyrics. I honestly have no idea why this song did not become a number one on the charts since it certainly has all the right qualities for a hit song, splendid vocals, immense lyrics and awesome muisicianship. \\"The Friends Of Mr. Cairo\\" sounds like a sound of days gone by with a thematic story telling quality to it. The rest of the album remains with this high standarad and I would most definetely recommend it.

B000B0QOJA|3.0|Yet another \\"found\\" recording to surface this year-- \\"One Down, One Up\\" presents about 85 minutes of live Coltrane from 1965, recorded at the Half Note and broadcast by Alan Grant on radio.  These recordings have circulated the bootleg and grey market circuit for years and are seeing legitimate releae for the first time in this package.    Coltrane at this point was still working with his \\"classic quartet\\"-- pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones, a group he kept together for four years.  The band had a number of triumphs, not the least of which was the recently recorded \\"A Love Supreme\\", when these sessions were held.  The quartet was nearing their end-- Pharoah Sanders would be performing regularly with them shortly and by the end of the year, both Tyner and Jones would leave the band.  As such, these recordings present a rare opportunity to experience the band in full flight.    The first disc picks up in the midst of a bass solo by Jimmy Garrison during \\"One Down, One Up\\" (Grant would later point out this broadcast began 35 minutes into the performance) before turning over to the legendary solo by Trane.  Trane rails away freely-- associating linearly and nonlinearly in and around the piece, bringing his monsterous technique to bear.  Tyner seems uncertain, pounding away for several minutes before dropping out and letting Trane stroll.  Garrison eventually drops off as well, leaving Trane and Jones in a fierce and noteworthy dialog.  The second piece, \\"Afro Blue\\", features Trane stating the theme before a simply fantastic and lovely solo by Tyner and then Tranee on soprano.  Unfortunately, the recording drops out just as Coltrane really starts cooking (the broadcast was only 45 minutes)!    The second show at least has the luxury of starting at the beginning of the performance-- \\"Song of Praise\\" rises slowly then comes to a boil, with Coltrane again taking an extended solo of awe-inspiring ferocity.  It seems though that Tyner is a bit tentative at first again, though he eventually sinks deep into the piece, particularly during his solo space.  But perhaps strangest on the record is the performance of \\"My Favorite Things\\"-- it's pretty far out for most performers, but for the Coltrane quartet, this is positively a tame performance that really doesn't live up to the frantic energy of the other tracks here.  Of course, it sounds like Trane was just winding up on his second solo when the recording fades out...    Sonically, this recording has some issues-- in particular the title track.  The source for this was clearly not in the best shape as the volume fades in and out, distorts and wavers.  It's really only the title track, the rest sound like something dubbed from the radio (which is pretty much what they are)-- a bit quiet, but with minimal flaws.  Also of note is the liner notes-- including essays by Ashley Khan and Ravi Coltrane.  Khan details the performance, the venue, the radio show and interviews several musicians for what turns out to be one of the better reads in CD liner notes, Ravi Coltrane focuses on the title track and its performance.    This isn't going to win any new converts-- the fidelity is too poor to.  If you're a fan of late period Coltrane (and make sure that's LATE PERIOD), you'll likely find quite a bit to like here.  Still, I don't find this compares favorably to other contemporary live recordings-- the sound quality is a bit too confused and quite frankly, it's pretty clear on listening that parts of the band were starting to disagree with Trane on where they wanted to go.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|I did not see this at the movies, but bought it because of recommendations, from friend's and I must say this Movie is Raunchy, and Disgusting (in places); BUT it is very funny. The basic STORY is that Kim Jong Il is plotting with terrorists to destroy the world; His plan includes enlisting many Hollywood actors (because of there terminal naivete, thinking that he will bring peace) to help him. Hey that's actually half way plausible-Hollywood loves dictators and murderous thugs like Castro; but this is not a serious movie; it basically makes FUN of everything and every one (poor Matt Damon). The movie is worth it alone, just to see how the Hollywood stars, puppets, meet there demise in such funny ways. I must also say the weird sex scene in this movie is totally disgusting and disturbing and well very funny-but not for kids. And You have got to see the scenes where team America misses there mark when firing at terrorists with missiles, just HILARIOUS. Also the way the puppets move around is crawling around on the floor funny and when the puppet's are in real scenic places, well, its just too funny. I think anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy Team America.

B00000F14B|5.0|one reviewer indicated what a long time it took for \\"the music man\\" to transfer from the stage to the screen...what nonsense! the music man premiered on broadway december 1957.....the film premiered in 1962.....just wanted to set that straight...otherwise I'm a prefectly sane and welbalanced person :-)
B00005ATQF|5.0|This movie had some of the best acting I've ever seen!  If you love war movies, and you haven't seen this one yet, you're missing a real gem.  Ermey was sensational as the D.I.!  The person who played Pyle, was also outstanding!  I never get tired of watching this movie.  Definitely a classic worth owning!
B000B5IPLK|3.0|I am a huge Alicia Keys fan. She's one of the few that combines raw talent and beauty. However, I find that while this Unplugged CD is NICE, it's not something I would go 'wow', or go out and tell people to get it. It's decent--no surprises. She does the intros very well. As a piano player myself I certainly appreciate her mixing classical music to her brand of soulful songs, but this album lacks SOUL...I like it overall, but her very first album is by far the best of all.
0060989157|5.0|This book is a fast paced , well delivered bio of one of the most famous rock bands of recent times. <br /> <br />Some of the problems with the book: <br /> <br />1. There is not enough material from Mick Mars and what is there feels more like the ghost writer(or Neil Straus) putting it on paper. Each band member should have been obligated to contribute equally. <br /> <br />2. Dates of events would have made more sense in this book rather that assuming that the reader knows when things occurred. <br /> <br />Pros: <br /> <br />1. The photos are pretty good, especially the young school shots of everyone.  <br /> <br />2.  Its funny to realize that Tommy was able to respond to what Nikki wrote earlier in the book and comment on that --especially regarding women. The book turns out to be a testament confessional of bad deeds and here is the place where the other guys find out about it at the same time we do. <br /> <br />3. Good chapters on John Carobi, the replacement singer. This material was not skimmed thru as what could have happened. <br /> <br />4. Excellent  yet depressing stuff about family. <br /> <br />I would have liked to have read more of  details during recording sessions, not necessarily why they wrote songs, but how the success of certain songs brought them specific fame(ie GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS was number 1 in japan etc). <br /> <br />The guys indicate at the end of the book that ther willbe a second book. It should be an interesting read.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Although not the first place to start for a new listener of sigur ros, i certainly think it is the best.  This album does not really have lyrics and it certainly doesnt need them.  unlike alot of bands who use there music to send a image through their words, sigur ros uses their instrumentation to send you into their world.  Best listened to using headphones, \\"()\\" is pretty much pink floyd stripped of their psychadelia, and guitar solos, leaving pure energy given in random doses. check out tracks 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 <br /> <br />if you want a more accesible listen, check out takk
B000ASATWQ|3.0|Welcome to Jamrock is by far the best and only really good track on this album.  The rest are o.k.  I thing this cd was over publicized very disappointed with this purchase.
0307276902|5.0|Not since I read \\"Don't Shoot We Are Your Children\\" have I been so affected by a book. \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" left me feeling as if I had just skidded 100 feet after falling off a motor cycle.  It's raw, it's real and it is riveting.   Like an accident beside the road, you want to put the book down but you can't stop looking...
B000AA305M|3.0|I was expecting more, after reading the glowing reviews.  I even listened to snippets here on Amazon before purchasing, but I'm not so impressed.  C+
B00007E8V4|5.0|I bought this album for the song \\"BOOM!\\" ,and really liked the whole album.The best songs are \\"Mr.Jack\\",\\"A.D.D\\",and \\"Chic'N'Stu\\" <br />If you are a Soad fan You must Own this album!I got it cheap,but <br />don't waste time this cd is awsome!
B00006LLOG|4.0|lou reeds transformer is his best solo album and is defintly a classic.his songs range from early altenitive rock to some classical peices. his lyrics are great, but on some tracks they dont really work. like on \\"andys chest\\", it started out good, but i got lost in his lyrics...shaving baby bears????c'mon!
B0009A1B7C|4.0|This album is okay.I bought it from Walmart,and it was cut and <br />clean.This was a pretty good until you got to \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" <br />that is the only crappy song on it.
B000002MJ0|5.0|this album is one of the greatest examples of how great pop rock is. this album is a must-have for fans of joy division, blur and oasis.
B000002H97|4.0|(...) it's obvious that this album is good, you guys just don't like it because it's popular which is stupid, sure it's slower, not my thrash here, but it's well put together, no this is not as good as the prior albums, but give me a break, it well deserves more than one star, it's catchy, it's got riffs, it's diverse, it's got veriety, it's what would come AFTER this album that was completely a turn-off, \\"Load\\" \\"Re-Load\\" \\"St. Anger\\", THOSE are 1 star albums, this is NOT, most of the songs have a certain groove to them, making this album different than the others, while the others had a groove, this has more, not saying it's the best, because it isn't, but ,certainly is damn good, there are spots on this album that remind me of \\"...And Justice For All\\" like \\"Holier than Thou\\", and I'm sure you would agree.    As for the production, it's got great cute production, you can hear everything, and yes the bass is here, Bob Rock produced it, so that's why the sound is clear, but, later on, Bob Rock would screw Metallica, I blame him for \\"Load\\" \\"Re-Load\\" and \\"St. Anger\\", but nice job with this one.    Enter Sandman 5/5, EVERYONE knows this song, it's a little outplayed, but I still enjoy it, still love the soloing!    Sad But True 5/5, slow, but very heavy, very cool sounding, another song everyone should know    Holier Than Thou 5/6, SOUNDS LIKE ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL!, pretty fast-paced, love it!    The Unforgiven 4/5...it's alright, not my favorite, much better on this album    Wherever I May Roam 5/6, LIKE THIS!, this song is so creative, the riffs and everything, one of the best!    Don't Tread on Me, 4/5, pretty good...not much to say    Through The Never 5/6!, ANOTHER ...And Justice For All sounding track!    Nothing Else Matters 0/0....sorry guys, I hate it, this was a bad idea, WAY to soft    Of Wolf And Man, 5/5, great song, cool chorus    The God That Failed 5/5, Cool riffs, leads, and stuff, love it    My Friend of Misery 4/5, it's pretty cool, just not as goodas some of the others    The Struggle Within 5/6, GREAT closer    Well, there it is, the last good Metallica album, and to people who don't like it because of it's popularity, that's just dumb, I have no problem admitting I like it, although it's not my favorite, and I will admit, it was the start of the downfall, but they weren't totally bad yet, because it's still very heavy, in a slower way, you could kind of tell where they were going with ...And Justice For All, while that was still Thrash, it was a bit slower than the previous efforts mostly, this is a bit more slowed down than ...And Justice For All for the most part of it, it's got those crunchy sludgy guitars, making it heavy as hell, abd catchy as hell, don't pay attention to those fools that say \\"OH THEY GOT POPULAR ON THE BLACK ALBUM, THEREFORE IT SUCKS\\" because it doesn't, it's very good for an album that started the decline, what I mean by that is, you could tell they were going to go slower than this on the next, and slower was not good, it was horrid, maybe someday they will come back!
B0002YLC24|1.0|This movie is basically nothing more than a dialogue.  Close your eyes and you won't miss anything, except Ethan Hawke's constant smirking.  The dialogue is very dry and boring.  After stringing us along for what seemed like 12 hours, the movie doesn't even reward is with some kind of resolution to their relationship.  It's not ambiguous in an interesting way.  It's just flat.  It deflates any interest you may have had in the story, such as it is.  This is an insufferable movie; maybe not the worst made in 2004, but the worst I saw in 2004.
B000002H6C|5.0|Production is not everything, and it's not that bad either, theres MUCH worse production out there, quit whining about it, Thrash wasn't really meant to have clean production, it was meant to sound old school/raw, no, you can't hear the bass, it's not there, although I would love to hear the bass, and Jason is a very good player, for Metal, the guitar, drums and vocals pretty much make it up, although, I do love bass solos, and there is none here, but oh well, I've always dealt with the production, at least it isn't muddy sounding.    Anyways, this is a VERY underrated album, coming off the great Master of Puppets, which went very well, they came out with this, and it's an excellent follow-up to MoP, although most songs aren't as fast as some on MoP, they still rule, for the most part, the songs are long, and epic, the shortest track is 5:12, most of them shoot towards 6-10 minutes, especially the title track and To Live is to Die, it's very different from MoP, more melodic, and like I said, more epic, but full of killer riffs, great solos, and James' vocals just rule, especially on this album, the songs are very catchy, and well structered, put together very well, Eye Of The Beholder is probably the slowest track on here, but it's a very good song, and catchy, a run down of the songs...    Blackened 5/6, EXCELLENT opener, very catchy and heavy, anti-war song, a very cool chorus too    ...And Justice for All 5/7, BY FAR, one my favorite tracks on the album, the nice melodic acoustic intro, and then the drum beat leads to the guitar riff, love the way they did that, it's long, and epic, and great, and heavy    Eye of the Beholder 5/6, A slower song, but you know how Metallica were, slow songs were heavy also, it kind of mixes elements of Blackened and the title track, very cool    One 5/7, ABSOLUTELY KILLER, one Metallica's best songs, it's about war you can tell, very nice the way the melodic music leads into where it gets heavy, and then all of the sudden, it getsfast as F*CK, killer!    The Shortest Straw 5/5, Not much to say about this one, it is a good song, cool chorus    Harvester of Sorrow 5/6, A very heavy chunky song, catchy as all hell, love the leads, and the riffs    The Frayed Ends of Sanity 5/7, ANOTHER favorite of mine, I love the way this song was put together, heavy as hell, well written, cool lyrics too, the way James laughs at the end \\"MEEEEEEYAHAHAHA!\\" is just awesome    To Live Is to Die 5/6, they pull off another great instrumental here, right up there with Pulling Teeth, The Call of Ktulu, Orion, Cliff wrote the lyrics towards the end, may he be remembered, killer bassist!    Dyers Eve 5/6, the shortest song on the album, clocking in at 5\\"12, a nice way to end the album, very cool riffs, lyrics, nice closer    Well, there you have it, AGAIN, a great album, and very underrated, just because of the production, it mostly got ignored, and that's BULLSH*T, don't pay attention to the production, it's not THAT bad, sure, it could have been better, but it could have been ALOT worse, it has a nice old school sound to it, very good album, it's always been in my top 10.
B000AARKOO|1.0|Being a history major focusing on medieval and Byzantine studies I really wanted to like the film.  I even saw it again a second time hoping I was just not into it the first time.  The Acting was poorly done.  The plot was totally unbelievable.  Every person of faith in the entire Movie was EVIL, not just a little off, but EVIL. Priest in the opening scene-evil. All Knights of faith-evil(atheist knights were all very good), Bishop of Jerusalem Evil.  Non-believing Hero-Good.  Religion is an oppressive evil institution used only to make evil religious people rich.   Actually, after studying history what bothered me the most is that EVERY good character had a 21st century concept of reality, freedom, rights and view of the world.  The middle ages had its own mindset, and this movie did NOT even Attempt to enter into the historical period.   Lastly, the Orlando Bloom character gave the Worst Inspirational speaches I had ever heard.  Why anyone would have followed him is beyond me.  That is all I can say without giving away plot and scenes.
B00009MGR6|5.0|I've come to the conclusion that EVERY AC/DC cd is worth FIVE STARS. Even if it sucks, it still ROCKS! AC/DC pounds blasts of fire and thunder and unprotected sex into EVERYONE.<br />Anyone who doesn't admit it has some sort of ego to protect.<br /><br />Not me, I once got crabs in my eyebrows after letting a strange punk rock chick sit on my face behind the dugout at the high school baseball feild. So what?<br /><br />This one almost crossed the line, I think one song MEANSTREAK almost starts to sound like a Huey Lewis and the News track, it narrowly escapes though and proceeds to ROCK! Dear god on that one, but the rest is more AC/DC greatness. GO ZONE; KISSIN'DYNAMITE; SUM SIN FOR NOTHIN' and evrything else will KICK YOUR A$$!
0553382179|5.0|Even though all this information is available on-line for free, this book brings it all together.  Yes is it simple but for some of us that exactly why we purchased the book.  If you are already an organized person then this book is not for you.  Don't rate it poorly just because you are not the target audience.  I rated the book a 5 because it writes what exactly it intended to convey.  It gives you an easy way to start getting out of the chaos and disorganization.  Thanks for helping Flylady.
0783225903|5.0|If film is where one finds the Cryptocracy communicating its coded messages and telegraphing its next move, \\"Brazil\\" may be an early pre-figuring of the world we find ourselves in now. Consider how the movie begins: as the camera moves through clouds in the sky, the song \\"Brazil\\" plays over the shot. Then, a time is shown on the screen -- 8:49. That's interesting. Eleven minutes before nine. Hmm. And, just as the \\"nine-eleven\\" signature appears, the lyrics from the song sing, \\"we stood beneath an amber moon and softly whispered someday soon.\\" As these lyrics are being sung, we see on the screen, \\"Somewhere soon.\\" Then, we see a city sidewalk and a storefront full of televisions. Suddenly, without warning, an explosion occurs. The camera then moves in close to a television that is still functioning. On it, a government official, head of the Ministry of Information (yes, that's the French \\"Moi\\"), is answering questions about the lastest \\"terrorist bombing.\\" He tells the man interviewing him that the terrorists are bad sports, that they aren't willing to play \\"the game.\\" For those who have read Kipling's \\"Kim\\" and are aware of the masonic significance of the \\"great game\\" in that novel, it's an interesting choice of words. Especially given the great game currently underway. The movie then proceeds to describe a world like Orwell's 1984. \\"Terrorists\\" are accused of carrying out attacks which presumably justifies the State's totalitarian organization and complete obliteration of anything real.  Like our current world, everything is simulated and facades mask reality. People are hypnotics, spellbound by the alchemy practised through social programming, propaganda, and terror. It's not even clear if the \\"terrorist\\" Tuttle is real or simply an agent provocateur assigned to ensure that the illusion of a real opposition continues to exist. Also of interest are the propganda posters pasted on walls in the industrial parts of the city -- some of them similar to posters used recently by the UK with eyes on them warning people to be on the lookout. In the end, \\"Brazil\\" captures the message of the \\"Matrix\\" and \\"1984.\\" There are no terrorists -- there is only the State that creates the illusion of terror to keep people distracted and dependent on the State.  Given all the other references in movies throughout the 1990s to that fateful day in September, one has to wonder what the director knew and when. For more examples of the Cryptocracy in film, check out the release date of the movie, \\"The Siege,\\" as well as it's original running time. Get the numbers, rotate them 180 degrees clockwise. Of course the plot speaks for itself --
B00008J4P5|4.0|I am into 60's and 70's stuff, and usually a bit contemptuous about late music! But this is really good! <br />That's a punk record! Drums are very basic but only made to <br />offer a perfect counterpoint to Jack's playing and singing! She is the extension for his guitar! <br />Nothing really else to be said! Raw and efficient music, never over the top, keep it to the roots! Jack is talented in his simplicity: a humble record, that I first heard over the last week, because I iniatially refused to listen to them after all the hype around them (yes, even in France!), they never show off and don't disappoint!
0802114970|5.0|Okay, I almost hate to admit that I've read this book through several times, but this is only because some people might find this kind of reading too scholarly.  Having said that, I LOVE this book.  These women are all incredibly fascinating, and Weir takes these historical figures and shows us that they were real women with pride, feelings, motives, and faults.  I wouldn't have ever guessed that I could enjoy a historical biography to this extent, but here I am recommending this (and Weir's other works) HIGHLY.  I've read several of her other books (see her work under the last name of Plowden, also), and have been pulled in just as strongly with each book.  One of her other books about Lady Jane Grey is phenomenal, and I'm currently reading through her work on Elizabeth I.   <br /> <br />You won't regret picking this one up, and I doubt you'll be able to put it down.  Pick a rainy weekend when you not only want to be entertained but would like to learn something in the process, and you won't be disappointed!!!
B0002858YS|4.0|there are a lot of people out there who feel The Killers aren't true \\"indie rock.\\"  True, they may sound pretty polished, but this album is great whatever you consider it!  I lived in a cave until December of 2004 when I was told about \\"Somebody Told Me.\\"  I seriously swear I was the last person in the country to hear it!  However, going off the recommendations I just decided to buy the cd.  Excellent idea!  It's a good mix of mellow and music to get you pumped up.  and if you are going out and need a little juice to get you ready, I highly recommend \\"Midnight Show.\\"  Total high energy!
B0009WFFS6|1.0|I'm so disappointed!  Could these songs be any slower or boring?  Clapton has been phoning it in since Cream broke up, and I thought I would finally get to hear him jam again, but no.  Just more of \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\" easy and slow guitar solos, no energy, no imagination.  Clapton's reputation is overrated and not deserved.  He can't touch guitar players like Alvin Lee or Jimmy Page.  Don't waste your money on this highly overhyped and underplayed reunion.
B0009OPO0S|5.0|This is a new Shakira, a Shakira who is in love, and who is letting us know that with her music, Fijacion Oral, the lyrics and different from what we are used to hearing from her. But in my opinion this is a very mature CD, and the best on yet. I love this album and she proves to be one of the best woman latin signers!! <br /> <br />1. En Tus Puplas: Great love song, powerful lyrics and amaezing music, just the type of song you want to dedicate to yr love one!! Cant get enough of it!! <br /> <br />2. La Pared: One of my favorite song of the CD, just amaezing!!!  <br /> <br />3. La Tortura: #1 single since it came out, need I say more? <br /> <br />4.Obtener Un Si: This song its different, it reminds me of a cartoon. Very comical music. Yet a little boring to listen to. <br /> <br />5. Dia Especial: Great drum beats at the beggining,great music, keeps you humming to the song and moving to the beat. Lyrically speaking, just great!! <br /> <br />6. Escondite Ingles: This is a great punk song, I feel in love with it inmediatly after listening to it for the first time, I identify with this lyrics and the beat is just out of this world, makes u want to jump out and down and scream!! Reminds me a little bit of No Doubt back in the days!! <br /> <br />7. No: This is a powerful love song, second single from the CD and just great lyrics, very smart writing from Shakira, very philosophical yet simple and very easy to grasp. <br /> <br />8. Las De La Intuicion: My favorite song from the CD, great music, andlyrics, just WOW!!!!! MY FAVORITE!!! <br /> <br />9. Dia De Enero: The song written to Shakiras love one!! Again you can tell how in love she is, the lyrics and comicas, a bit funny yet deep!!! Nice song!! <br /> <br />10.Lo Impresindible: This is what I call a hard core song!!! Just great!!! If you are a Shakira fan you will love this song! <br /> <br />11. La Pared (Acoustic Version): I wouldnt be surprise if this track becomes the third single but the original version!!  <br /> <br />12. La Tortura (Shaketon Remix): Hell yeah!!!! <br /> <br />DVD SIDE: <br /> <br />The sounf is just great, the lyrics are available in English!! The video from \\"La Tortura\\" is just a must see. Making of Fijacion Oral Vol. 1. Very interesting and the conversation with Alex Sanz is supper funny!! I loved it!!
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Yes, it was a good run of shows at RAH. Three good (not great) musicians playing competently. This is NOT your father's Cream; 37 years has a way of changing things, like it or not. Yes, these three musicians were smart enough to play these songs 2000-style, not like it was in 1968, when last they played. I particularly liked that Jack Bruce didn't revert back to his super-distorto bass sounds of the late 60s. Clapton playing a Strat in Cream was also a stroke of genius; it allowed him to reinvent his work. But, (and this is a big BUT) they played like a Cream cover band. Cream shows were known for their free-wheeling segments, but there was none of that during these shows. The most group improv shown is in the middle of a couple of songs where Clapton puts the other two in a one chord groove while he solos until he's done, at which point they get back into the tune. No magical interplay, no \\"where to now?\\" mentality, just competent playing from three seasoned vets. Good to show the kids that musicians can actually play, but that's about all.
B000002P5W|5.0|Axis Bold As Love is an incredible album that really shows Hendrix's ability to vary his sound, something that is hard to find amongst rock bands these days.  Unlike Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland, Axis Bold As Love has a much more subtle beauty and may require more listening to it to appreciate if you are not a hard-core Jimi fan.  Amongst the tracks,  Castles Made of Sand is a soft ballad that is impossible not to love (and shows that Jimi can write, critics nothwithstanding). Little Wing is simply gorgeous a very unique sound. If 6 was 9 is delivers the funk, while Wait Until Tommorow is a refreshing ballad that has a great rhythym and clarity to it. Finally, the title track shows Jimi's solo guitar prowess, and One Rainy Wish is psychadelic in a way that only Jimi can deliver.  Over all another wonderful album by Hendrix, and probably a precursor to the First Rays of the New Rising Sun.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|If you can't put up with the comic book scene transitions, I understand, but don't let that stop you from enjoying what is an otherwise fantastic release of this cult classic.
0671027387|1.0|Typical of a freshly famous author, Dan Brown's old garbage has been released on the public. The same storyline, stereotypical characters, plot moments and endings happen in all of them.<br /><br />This and other non-DaVinci Code books of Dan Brown are repetitive and unimaginative, characterised by lack-lustre writing and the same old mind-numbing, lowest common denominator storyline. Don't waste your money on it.
B000089RVX|5.0|My immortal is I believe, the only reason to buy this album. This song is a timeless song and is a great piece of art. It reminded me of some great lines which I read years ago in some book, those lines go something like this \\" What can you do in the face of such a vengeance? Such a wrath of angels who seemed angered perpetually! And for what? You were just a deer in the headlight through all that happened. Now here you are bound to that eternally churning guilt that you are not sure will go away even after death takes your breath away!\\" <br />In the summary, My Immortal is a dark piece of beauty which won't fade away for years and years to come. <br />Scott
B000059XUO|3.0|Unfortunately, this often brilliant film carries the stigma of being the film in which its star, Brandon Lee, was killed on the set before filming was done.  Without focusing too much on this tragedy and in looking at the film itself, THE CROW is a dark, somber look at a young man whose untimely death is somewhat redeemed in his return from the dead to seek vengeance on the men responsible for his and his fiancee's brutal murders.  With Michael Wincott as the appropriately vile chief villain and Ernie Hudson as the cop who helps him out, Lee manages to get his desired revenge.  The settings are dimly lit at times, adding to the comic book visuals of the film and there are occasional flashes of dark humor that foreshadowed what a competent actor Lee was and whose bright future was suddenly ended.  A visually stunning film, that spawned three sequels.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Don't be fooled into thinking this show is just for \\"teens.\\"  It may be set in a high school but this show has so much more to offer. I'm a 25 year old male, I've also got my brother and sister in law into the show (they are in there 30s) and my mother(in her 50s). It's not just for fans of buffy/oc/dawsons creek whatever other teen drama.  It is brilliantly written, and has as much great humour as it does drama.  The first season builds and builds to an amazing climax.  This show is serially underwatched and the DVD is the perfect opportunity to get into the best TV show you are not watching.  This was probably my favorite show last year, I decided to check it out after it began appearing in some critics best tv shows list.  After watching a few episodes I was hooked, and I'm sure you will too.  This is for the casual observer who came across this product, BUY IT! It's great value and you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Note: this film review is for people who have already seen 'AI' as it does contain some spoilers. <br />     It was 11:30 pm the other night and I couldn't sleep, so I decided to start a film we had rented.  After watching it I really couldn't sleep!  <br />     I started 'AI' expecting a sort of entertaining robot film but instead received a story that has kept me thinking for days now.  I already knew the basic elements to the plot - robot child in a harsh world - but that was about it.  There are already plenty of plot reviews on here telling the entire story so I will not go into all those details.  This review is basically to expound on what I got out of this film and to state what precisely I found the ending to be.   <br />Many people's reviews either loved or hated this film basically because of the ending.  It was surprising how many said to leave before the last half-hour of the film.  I must say here that I have never seen '2001: Space Odyssey' or any Stanley Kubrick films, but if the film had ended where I originally thought it would (in underwater Manhatten, where Kubrick apparently intended) then I would have been terribly upset.  But I'll discuss the ending some more later on.   <br />     To begin, I was immediately drawn into the film and did not find it to lag or be 'slow'.  In fact, I rather lost track of time and completely immersed myself in the story.  The first quarter/third of the film simply was quite powerful and the forest scene was one of the most harrowing things I'd ever seen.  I really did not have any problems with Henry and Martin disliking David or that Monica was the only person David referred to by the intimate name of 'Mommy'.  Henry and Martin basically viewed David as a 'toy', as shown by Martin's words (\\"Oh, you're the new supertoy now.  Can you fly?  Walk on the ceiling?  Do super-cool stuff?\\") and Henry's actions (i.e. shaking David as if he can't be hurt).  In fact, I got the impression that Henry only 'got' David because he disliked to see his wife so upset.  So he presented Monica with a new 'supertoy' and that's a reason why he can't understand why Monica would like David (after the hair incident.)  And, to me the reason that Monica would 'dump' David was basically because she was more worried about Martin.  Which, unfortunately makes sense.  She's just recovered her son who's been in a coma for a few years, then he nearly drowns thanks to this robot-kid, and she's not going to lose Martin again.  But, she also shows a great deal of concern for David - after all, she could have taken him back to the lab, but didn't.     <br />     The disc we had rented had some scratches on it so I basically missed the last half of the Flesh Fair segment.  Too bad - it seemed important.     <br />     The parts after the Flesh Fair (Rouge City to the ending) really changed for me and I felt as though I was watching a completely different film.  It switched from sci-fi to fairy tale and that threw me off guard completely.   <br />     As stated earlier, if the film had ended underwater, I would have been completely upset.  As the way it did end, I was able to 'enjoy' it a bit more, although it was still disturbing.  More spoilers follow.  The ending could have been the most beautiful thing in the world or the saddest thing ever created.  The idea I derived is something I have not yet run across in any other reviews.  To me, David does achieve his 'Pinocchio' dream at the end.  Waiting 2000 years was not the point.  Bringing back 'Mommy' was not the point.  The point was that for the first time, Mommy can tell David 'I love you and have always loved you,' before David cries and (for the first time in the film and his life) sleeps.  A robot cannot sleep - David says so earlier ('No, I can't sleep.  But I can lay very still and not make a sound.')  So, to me, David does become 'real' - this is so tragic in the sense that finally, after millennia, he has acheived his greatest happiness and now there is no one to share it with.  Or, it could be the most beautiful ending, for now he is real and can achieve death - something he couldn't do earlier.  As the narrator says in the ending, \\"And now David could go to where dreams were made.\\"  So, in a sense, this fairy tale really did get the 'happily-ever-after' ending.  David and Mommy, together forever by themselves with no Henry and no Martin to worry about.   <br />     The four stars (as opposed to five) are because of the scenes I felt were completely unnecessary; i.e. red-light visual of Rouge City and some of the sleazier parts.  Yes, the world is a dark and unfriendly place in the film, but I think that's pretty obvious from the way people behave in a family unit.  If a family cannot have control, then it follows that the world will be unable to control itself.   <br />     And, I know everyone else has said this, but Haley Joel Osment's acting was incredible.  Jude Law as Joe was an interesting sidekick, and I felt got the most powerful line to say ('I am, I was.')  Teddy was pretty cool at first, until I realized how creepy it would be if toys really did come to life. <br />     Lastly, I found the theme of the film to basically be 'what is the worth of this?'.  How easy is it for someone (or some couple) to become bored, or depressed, and use an escapist method (in this case, David) until something happens (in this case, Martin) where they no longer need or care for the product?  The reason that the film left me feeling hollow and cold inside is that it showed how quickly things lost their value.  Henry and Monica and Martin used David until he wasn't worthwhile (or until he was 'too dangerous') and then abondoned him to the world.  Ultimately, they're the ones who missed out on all the love David had to offer eternally and unconditionally.
B000022TSV|5.0|You cannot close your eyes, the film adds something so special to the music even if Migenes is not the best voice Carmen ever had ... More beautiful than any other Carmen movie (let alone the opera on stage) because it was shot in Spain.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|...and more.  this movie is an orgasm for the eyes.  it is, to date, the most impresive feat of CG animation ever created.  the story ties up the loose ends of the game handily, even putting to rest the great Tifa/Aerith dispute.  it's decent in length, which is a surprise as well as pleasure, and does not scrimp on the fight scenes.  my only real gripe is that the other characters do not get a lot of screen time, but then, this isn't their story.  they all got nice and tidy resolutions in-game, unlike Cloud.  for those pissed about the ending to the game, here you are.  the ending of Final Fantasy VII.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I'm going to keep this short and too the point friends: <br />This record should suck. I mean, all of Depeche Mode's contempories, if in time if not the same sound, like R.E.M.(\\"Around the Sun\\"), The Cure(\\"The Cure\\") and Morrissey(\\"You Are the Quarry\\") have been running on autopilot lately, releasing records so they can tour. Why shouldn't Depeche Mode do that same. <br />But man they had to go and prove they could still make good, contemporary music that only isn't boring, embarrassing and lifeless(check the aforementioned three bands last records), but it's their best, and I know this has been quoted to death but for once it's actually TRUE!, since \\"Violater\\". A strong, smart, well written record(it's also cool that Gahan, the man with the voice, wrote three songs on the record and they're almost as good as Gore's selections) that any Depeche Mode fan will be proud to have in their collection. <br />This isn't supposed to happen twenty five years into your careers guys.
B000002AD0|5.0|A very young Carlos Santana shows us why he is destined to still be rich and famous 30+ years later.Because he deserves it.Mr Santana,Gregg Rollie and the band charge through an extended set of deep,soulful tunes.Every note, every tick of the cymbal can be clearly heard.  This one was recorded 3 months before the Woodstock  performance, with a different drummer. This performance  was tighter and better overall---and the quality of the   recording is wonderful. A 2 disc set that should not be missed.This is one of those albums that will have anyone  who hears it asking you \\"what is this?--this is great!\\"
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Finally, a return to their forte-dark, nihilistic dance music.  Upon listening to the first track, I was stunned how much Dave Gahan's voice sounded like Jim Morrison.  I may be the only one who thought that, but it really was eerie. This, I believe, is their best work since 'Violator'.  'Songs..' was mediocre and 'Ultra' was decent, but 'Exciter' did anything but excite.   I've been a fan of DM since 'People Are People'(a song that I love), and despite any time between albums or chart placing, they have one of the most loyal, fanatical fan bases of any band I can think of. The only other band that would come close would be The Cure(my favorite band ever).  But I digress.  Not buying this album would be missing out on one of the best records of the year, if not the best.
0140177396|4.0|In John Steinbeck 1937 novel there are two men one named Lennie who is a tall, big, squared man who faces mental problems and his friend, George, who has known Lennie for as long as he can remember. George is a skinny man that sometimes gets annoyed by Lennie's mental problems. Lennie and George live and work on a simple and plain ranch and have many dreams and stories behind ranch they work at. The ending of this book is very shocking. I suggest that kids of the age 13 and below should not read this book. If you want a steady pace and shocking ending book, then you got to read \\"Of Mice and Men\\". <br /> <br />
B000B7HZXM|3.0|The fourth installment of Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook albums follows the formula of the first three.  The songs are well-known standards that Mr. Stewart sings to the standard arrangements.  The arrangements are simple and unimaginative and Mr. Stewart's whiskey-soaked voice isn't really suited to this style of singing.  Despite this, the album has a casual charm and you can tell Mr. Stewart is really enjoying himself in this newfound role as lounge crooner.  There are a couple more duets included than one the previous albums and his duet on his idol's Sam Cooke's \\"You Send Me\\" with Chaka Khan is the best track on the album.  His duet with Diana Ross on \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" also has some live, but his duet with Elton John on \\"Makin' Whoopee\\" is tired and forced.  \\"I've Got Love To Keep Me Warm\\" and \\"Let's Fall In Love\\" (which has George Benson on guitar) also are quite good.  If you are a fan of the first three Songbook entries, then you will thoroughly enjoy this effort as well.

0740748475|5.0|Having been a big fan of Calvin & Hobbes forever and ever, I discovered quite by chance, that their collected endeavors had been published and jumped at the chance to get a copy.<br /><br />AND......I must say, this is an absolute joy. The books are exquisitely made in three volumes on heavy paper  and will thus survive many a happy hour of thumbing.<br /><br />Such a pity that the series were discontinued!
0804836272|5.0|I remember back in the 80's wondering if any english book of any sort would ever come out regarding the Shinsengumi. Over the years since that time I have collected various things on Japanese history that vaguely touch on the group, read small references regarding them in scholarly texts and martial arts magazines, seen a few plays about them, and dozens of movies ranging from noble portrayals of the group to rare stuff where executed members of the group come back as ghosts to haunt their former comrades (lol!). The day has finally come for the Shinsengumi with Romulus Hillsborough's new book. <br /> <br /> Like Hillsborough's former works, this book is in the same style that can be considered \\"Historical Fiction\\". He acknowledges this in the preface that the book is not entirely nonfiction and gives his reasons for this. With that said, he does use many of the essential Japanese sources used to create his biography of the group. Part of the problem with dealing with the history of the Shinsengumi is that they have become such folk heroes where myth and fact have become blurred. It is the same type of problem one encounters with western gunfighters and the history of the old west. So many movies and novels have been made that are based on all of these guys, but add \\"creative\\" elements to the stories that add on to the myth. One can wonder if anything that \\"corresponds with historical reality\\" can be seen or written about these folk heroes. <br /> <br /> So, with that said, Hillsborough's book does attempt to give a literary type of biography of the Shinsengumi. It is not a dry text that tries to cram all sorts of statistics and dates about the group, but like an artist trying to paint a picture, the book tries to paint portraits about the Shinsengumi using his style of writing. Certain words and phrases are used over and over to hammer home the way he feels about certain people and events. When this book was announced a few years ago I knew, based on Hillsborough's previous works, that he would definitely have a certain viewpoint about the Shinsengumi. They are not always presented in the best possible light. However, I respect the viewpoint since they are, and always will be, a controversial group. <br /> <br /> The majority of the book covers the years roughly around 1863-1868. Most of the chapters deal with the key events of their time in Kyoto which are the core years of the Shinsengumi. The time in Kyoto is the most important since that is where they make a name for themselves and when they depart Kyoto everything is downhill after that. There is an epilogue chapter on what happens after the death of Kondo Isami, but at that point the few individuals left aren't really the Shinsengumi anymore in the same sense they were during the Kyoto years. So, it makes sense how he ended the book. <br /> <br /> It is a good book for anyone being introduced to the Shinsengumi, but I think any fan of the days leading to the end of the Shogun will enjoy and be challenged by this book.
B000AA4M9U|5.0|there are a couple of weak spots in this cd but have to say that i completely enjoy the music.
630512762X|5.0|\\"Face/Off\\" is a dynamite-packed action powerhouse, with loads of stuff being blown to Kingdom Come, lots of people getting shot at and shot and loads of fun tossed in for good measure.<br /><br />The basic plot takes you along with obsessive FBI agent Sean Archer in his all-consuming chase for arch-enemy and criminal nasty type, Castor Troy, backed up by his genius brother, Pollux. Part of this chase requires Archer to assume Troy's identity via surgery, completely off the record and totally \\"black bag\\". Of course, it all goes wrong.<br /><br />\\"Face/Off\\" almost seems choreographed in its fight sequences and shoot outs, which is pretty usual for director John Woo's style. However, the action is fast, furious and volatile. There is also lots of it.<br /><br />Both John Travolta and Nicholas Cage are brilliant as Sean Archer and Castor Troy, a challenging duality of personalities to act. Both actors did a marvelous job of it.<br /><br />Under all the violence, there are glimpses of Archer's personal journey as he delves into Castor Troy's world. Archer's dealings with Sasha, (Troy's girlfriend), promote some realisation and increased humanity in him.<br /><br />I have seen this movie a whole heap of times, and find that the years have not diminished it as a great action movie. It is one that can be seen again and again, with the same sense of relish and entertainment.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|This is their return to dark-brooding electronic rock. The synths are great, production is top-notch. Gahan's vocals are second to none, and Gore's guitar seems to be a rift machine. <br /> <br />5/5 songs : A Pain That I'm Used to, John the Revelator, Precious, I Want It All, The Darkest Star, The Sinner In Me,Nothing's Impossible <br />4/5 songs : Suffer Well, Macrovision, Lilian  <br />3/5 songs : Damaged People, Introspectre(instrumental) <br /> <br />overall- their strongest album since SOFAD and since Alan Wilder left in 1995.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|It was not an incredibly difficult feat for DM to surpass the ironically-titled (yet underrated in my opinion) Exciter, but little did we know that they would surpass most of our expectations to this degree. This album rocks. Overall, it's their darkest album yet, especially following the somewhat sweet and tender mood of Exciter. <br /> <br />I don't normally do this, but here's a track by track: <br /> <br />1) \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" - A great intro track with definite NIN influence. Soft, dark, electronic beats that explode into a cacophony of loud guitars at the chorus. I heard this is going to be the second single. <br /> <br />2) \\"John The Revelator\\" - Influenced by a classic gospel track of the same name, this would have fit beautifully on Songs of Faith & Devotion. A heavy electro beat with Dave's preachy, aggressive vocals and a gospel choir that joins in at the chorus. My immediate favorite. I really hope this one becomes a single. <br /> <br />3) \\"Suffer Well\\" - The first of three songs written by Dave Gahan instead of Martin Gore (a first for DM). More than worthy of the Depeche Mode moniker, this is another favorite of mine. It's fast and catchy and very reminiscent of old-school pre-Violator DM. Reminds me of \\"Behind The Wheel.\\" <br /> <br />4) \\"The Sinner In Me\\" - Another NIN-esque track. Dark and moody. Awesome synth line. I love it. <br /> <br />5) \\"Precious\\" - The first single. Also reminiscent of older DM - a very catchy song with a nice beat, a cool guitar part, and Dave's smooth vocals. For some reason I like this song a lot better within the context of the whole album. A very worthy first single. Many are saying it's one of the best singles of their career. I can't argue with that. <br /> <br />6) \\"Macro\\" - The first of the obligatory Martin Gore ballads. This is actually one of my favorites of his. The verses are kind of odd (which is typical of Gore), but I absolutely love the chorus (\\"see the microcosm in macrovision / our bodies moving with pure precision / one universal celebration / one evolution, one creation\\"). Severely underrated. <br /> <br />7) \\"I Want It All\\" - The next of the Gahan-penned tracks. It's strange and floaty and quite different from a typical DM song, but really good nonetheless. The beat is similar to Bjork's \\"All Is Full of Love\\" (which is one of my favorite songs, by the way). <br /> <br />8) \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" - The last of the Gahan-penned tracks, and definitely my least favorite of the three. It has an old-school feel, but Dave's vocals are a bit odd and monotone. It's not one of my favorites, but it's grown on me significantly and now I like it quite a bit. <br /> <br />9) \\"Introspectre\\" - A creepy little instrumental interlude. Could have been pulled right off of Radiohead's Kid A. There's not much to it. Eerie sound effects among minimal electronics. <br /> <br />10) \\"Damaged People\\" - The other Gore ballad. Slow, slightly creepy circus music with Gore's odd vocals. This has grown on me a lot, too, but is definitely one of the weakest tracks. <br /> <br />11) \\"Lilian\\" - An awesome, retro-sounding, fast-paced, catchy song about some spoiled, sadistic woman who likes to break hearts for fun. The sound is not stereotypical of DM, though, and I can't put a finger on why. <br /> <br />12) \\"The Darkest Star\\" - Another somewhat creepy slow song that's probably the darkest on the album. I didn't care much for it at first, but now I love it. <br /> <br />Since the release of Ultra, it's been my favorite DM album (even though many fans disliked it for some reason), followed very closely by Violator and Songs of Faith & Devotion. Critics keep saying Playing The Angel is their best since Violator. I really think, though, that it has risen up to possibly be their greatest masterpiece yet. Only time will tell if I feel the same way down the road, but right now that's where I stand.

B00002ZMNV|5.0|The oasis for four metal gods in the desert of mediocrity that was the 90's.  It's heavy, it's intense, it's beautiful, and it's one the greatest things that has ever reverberated against my eardrums.  The timpani and strings go perfectly with the low, evil-sounding guitars on the slower, harder beginning tracks (The Call of Ktulu, Of Wolf and Man, The Thing that Should Not Be).  The brass and again the strings amplify the heavy riffing of songs like For Whom the Bell Tolls and Fuel.  The ballads are almost personified by the soft violins, creating a near-tear jerking blend of the most heartfelt poetry in music history and Michael Kamen's genius vision.  Hetfield's voice is touching at times, downright scary at others.  Lars, despite what you think of him, creates impossibly speedy rolls that will make you believe he has three sets of limbs.  Hammett's (still) incredible high wails fill the scape of sound with an undertone of roughness and grit (when appropriate, of course).  Newstead lays down the usual basslines, but unfortunately his contribution is often drowned out by the sheer amplitude that over 100 instruments can produce.  Luckily that oversight doesn't cost the production in overall sound quality, which is the best I have ever heard from a live concert.  The stunning performance of metal anthem One is the climax of the careers of four middle-aged men who used to be on top of the world.   My only complaint is the omission of a few classic songs (...and Justice for All, The Unforgiven, Fade to Black), but that is to be expected of any greatest hits collaboration (which, in reality, S&M is).  <br /> <br />If you want to have your ears sweetly shattered by the best noise the Lord our God has allowed to be heard on his earth, buy the double-live album.  If you want to turn your living room into a chamber of echoing serenity and flashing lights, buy the DVD.  If you thought that Metallica has sucked since the Black Album, buy both as payment for your transgressions.  You won't be disappointed.

B00005JNTX|5.0|SIN CITY is a film for discriminating and intelligent adults.  The imagining of the film, the production design, the cinematography, are splendid.  And mind-bogglingly original.

Although the difference between Shania and a load of other pretty faces in the music industry is that Shania's beauty stems from within and she has the talent and class to back up her great looks.
B000002G9S|5.0|Free is a very underestimated band. The group emerged from the british scene that was mixing blues and rock roots to create what later would be called \\"heavy metal\\".<br /><br />The band was formed by the same Zeppelin manager, but their destiny were a little bit different.<br /><br />they started very heavy, very bluesy, with \\"Tons os Sobs\\".<br /><br />Here, on \\"Fire and Water\\", they're they are playing slow, smooth, passionated. We have Andy playing sweet piano parts, along with accurated bass lines, alng with tender and very rock Guitar from Kossoff and his \\"bandings\\" nodded even by Eric Clapton.<br /><br />Paul Rodgers is in great shape, with simple and souring vocal for simple and souring lyrics he created.<br /><br />Kirke was always a negative point. He should play not ina rock band, but in a military band playing marchs. That was the only thing he knew at the time, and alive was even worse.<br /><br />All tunes are very nice, but i'll pick up some: \\"Fire and Water\\", \\"Oh I wept!\\", \\"Remember\\", \\"Mr. big\\" and \\"All right now\\".<br /><br />Recently, a sad version of \\"All right Now\\" was helping GM to sell cars here in Brazil. Very sad to see rock n' roll selling products, but this is not the point here. Just listen to this record, not expecting a hard rock album, but a good and smooth rock n' roll from the early seventies.<br /><br />This album is a peak they would never reach again.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I'm a big DM fan, but DM has never been the same since Alan Wilder's departure. The songs are well written, and there is no denying Martin Gore's song writing skills. However, the songs on this album seem to be misguided in production. It actually sounds like Gore's \\"Counterfeit 2\\" album except with Gahan on vocals. The songs never reached their full potential. Songs such as \\"The Sinner in Me\\" and \\"The Pain I am used to\\" could have been great(a la \\"Never let me Down Again\\" or \\"Personal Jesus\\"). But the songs just never got there. Dont get me wrong, this is a good album, and will definitely grow on you...but I know DM can do better. <br /> <br />Couple of Solutions for DM: <br />1) Swallow your pride and get Alan Wilder to produce the songs. <br />2) Do an acoustic album to place the focus on the song writing rather than the annoying bleeps and distorted synth sounds.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Sadly, VNV Naton is now better at making Depeche Mode albums than Depeche Mode is. If you liked Exciter, this is more of the same.

B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman is more than a superhero, more than movie and comic book entertainment.  He is cold, disciplined justice that protects the weak - yet is tragically flawed.  He is the dark part of the subconcious that lurks in all of us.  Batman represents the border between sanity and insanity.<br /><br />Batman is more than a cultural icon.  He is a legend and a myth.  Why else is New York City often referred to as \\"Gotham?\\"  In the astounding Batman Begins, the myth is reborn.<br /><br />Christian Bale is perfect to play Bruce Wayne, the billionaire who is orphaned when a mugger kills his mother and father in cold blood.  When I saw Bale in \\"Equilibrium,\\" his tiger-like athleticism and dark, brooding demeanor made me confident that Bale was worthy to inherit the mantle of Batman.  For those of you who liked the Matrix, I highly recommend you check out Equilibrium.<br /><br />In \\"Begins,\\" director Christopher Nolan (Memento) and screenplay co-writer David Goyer explore how Wayne adopts his alter ego.  On a Siddartha-like quest, Wayne leaves his friends and business empire to find himself in the (Very) Far East.<br /><br />The talent in this movie is astounding.  Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) plays enigmatic Ras-Al-Ghul, powerful head of a spiritual, ninja-like clan.

6305897786|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I would have to say though that the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The deus machina or maybe daemonus machina kinda ruined it for me but the parts without her are really excellent.  As someone who works with rare books it was really exciting to see a movie like this!  The character portrayals are a little stereotypical but for the most part they are right on.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series had everything you could ask for... engaging believable characters, great storytelling, humor, and pathos all in a universe that you just want to keep exploring. <br /> <br />Here's hoping that the franchise will endure even beyond the feature film.  It certainly deserves to.
0765340798|2.0|Having read the first two books of this trilogy, I picked up the third book with some worry.  This book wasn't great, but it did not make me stop reading the book 1/2 way through as I had feared. <br /> <br />The Battle of Corrin tells the story of the creation of the society that Frank Herbert created in Dune and of the climactic battle that ends the war against thinking machines.  I would say that it ends the Butlerian Jihad, but strangely, the Jihad was \\"declared\\" before the battle that Frank Herbert tells us ended it. <br /> <br />First the good points.  The authors finally reread Dune and realized that the Butlerian Jihad was not a war against robots but a war against all electronic devices.  One of the characters (a young girl who had a vision while in the grip of a deadly plague) creates the Cult of Serena, which is determined to destroy all computers.  She insinuates her way to power (it helps that she is the niece of the leader of the League of Nobles and related to Serena) and unleashes her vision on humanity, smashing all electronic devices no matter how helpful or harmless. <br /> <br />The authors manage to capture a bit of the feeling of Paul in the original book actually able to capture the imagination of his followers as a prophet and then manipulate his followers to gain power. <br /> <br />Second, I did like the description of the creation of the Fremen on Dune.  The authors managed to find a way to create a group of very noble, very violent and very outcast people (outcasts from the outcasts) that is a plausible precursor to the Fremen. <br /> <br />Third, I found it ironic that actual robots/computers were the ones responsible for the humans who took over this role once they were destroyed, Mentats. <br /> <br />Fourth, I did come to enjoy Erasmus.  He started out very wooden.  A combination of the generic evil character and Data or Pinocchio or any of the many, many non-human characters whose only desire is to become a human.  By the third bookhe is actually interesting. <br /> <br />Finally, I did like the slight ambiguity at the end.  Frank Herbert basically lets us know that the Honored Matres at the end of his books encountered very strange things when they were scattered by the death of Leto II.  Both trilogies have now ended with hints about what those strange things may be.  Bravo. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the bad at least equals the good in the book.  Others have pointed out how odd the betrayal of the Harkonnens in the Battle of Corrin was.  I concur.  It seemed very contrived.  We all knew it was coming from the original Dune, so the fact that there was a betrayal is not a spoiler, but I can't go into what was wrong with the betrayal without a giant spoiler.  It's too bad because the authors' idea--\\"legends are often twisted\\"--is not a bad one. <br /> <br />The other almost unforgivable thing is the author's unsubtlety towards religion.  Frank Herbert gave us very interesting ideas about religion and humanity in his Dune books.  As I read them, Frank tells us that religion and spirituality is very important for the growth of humanity and for keeping humans in an organized society.  He tells us that too much religion, especially when concentrated with secular power, can lead to very dangerous things.  But also tells us that it may not be possible to separate the good from the bad in religion. <br /> <br />The authors of this trilogy understand that religion is important for keeping humanity in line, but tend to see it as just something to keep the dumb people in line.  They portray all the heroes as basically tolerantly (or not tolerantly) supporting the silly religion of the masses but not being part of it, or they see religious people as crazy like Rayna. <br /> <br />Frank teaches us that smart people and true leaders are often deeply religious themselves, that mysticism and religion is important for Fremen, for Bene Gesserit, and many others.  But that it can never be handled.  His son does not understand this.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I love this cd. Mariah really made a comeback. I can't wait until November 15th because Mimi is re-releasing The Emancipation of Mimi with four added tracks and a special limited edition DVD with all of her current videos including \\"Get Ur Number\\" which was release in Europe. Also her new single which is sooo hott it's blazing on heavy rotation on radio stations. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" such a hott track! Kinda reminds me of a We Belong Together part 2. I can't wait to get it. But everyone go out and get it even if u already have the orginal edition because I know it's gonna be worth it. One love.
B0000028RR|5.0|AMAZING. One of the best albums I have ever experienced in my life I say experienced and not heard because this album goes beyond sound. Zach's poetry and the band's power create an infinitely unique energy with no comparison. Every song on the album is poetry... the energy I feel when I listen to this album is remarkable. Zach's truth on political and social issues fueled by his anger make this album A MUST HAVE. Listen to the album then fnd the lyrics and read them because they are so amazing.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|James Cameron's Titanic, the highest grossing movie of all time, follows the story of Jack and Rose set on the doomed 1912 maiden voyage of the Titanic. <br /> <br />Due to its craftsmanship on many levels, the movie attains a power rare among movies, reminiscent of the first installment of the Star Wars saga. <br /> <br />Though it is not unusual for movies to be based on audience-pleasing wish-fulfillment fantasy, in this case the fantasy is very illusory.  The movie shows how Rose is \\"redeemed\\" by Jack--freed from tyrannical mother and fiance (her father is dead) and enabled by her very brief love affair to lead a fulfilling and whole life. <br /> <br />It is clear from real life that a situation like this almost never happens.  Father-absent girls don't attain what they need for life through the temporary attention of a sporadic nomad figure like Jack but through the consistent love of a father figure to give them a sense of worthiness and security to face the world (cf. Bowlby).  In real life, Rose would have been too insecure to leave her situation and would have probably come crawling back.  Otherwise she would have escaped to 1912 America and most likely fallen into a life of poverty, e.g. prostitution. <br /> <br />As in Out of Africa, the male hero conveniently dies without having to take responsibility to love and care for a family (can you see Jack the nomad-artist feeding babies?  Ugh - some lover.). <br /> <br />If Cameron intended a layer of spiritual meaning here, that's also a fallacy: pseudo-redemption by Jack a dead Christ figure--rather than the love of a supportive Daddy/God--results in lostness. <br /> <br />This being said, the movie has entertainment value--particularly if its basic fallacy is kept in mind. <br /> <br />
0671027387|4.0|Great read after the previous book \\"Angels and Demons\\". For this \\"Deception Point\\" I was hooked at the beginning but slowly waned off towards the end.  There are some good descriptions of the American's political systems/scenes and the author Dan Brown kept me guessing until towards the 4/5 of the book.  Then after that, the story went down hill (or shall I say, down the drain into the deep dark ocean); the scenario reminded me of some B-grade Hollywood action thriller movie. Overall, it is a good book to read.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|The vocals are painful, the music is not good... i bought the album because amazon.com recommended it in my list. I'll try listening to it again as the other reviewers said that they did... but i'm not very hopeful, seeing as there are so many other bands out there that are worth spending time on.
