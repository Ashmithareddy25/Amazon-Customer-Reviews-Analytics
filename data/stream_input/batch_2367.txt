B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Awesome pawsome. Really good qualities of the beginning in only one status of the beginning in only one status and I love it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|At the surface of the story of BL is pretty simple and straight forward. Basically, an Outcome agent is in need of his meds. However,for the viewers with a little higher IQ the story is much deeper than that. As the secret operations and mastermind behind those assassin programs reveal itself, NRAG, who is headed by Eric Byer played by Edward Norton. Edward does a fantastic job playing the mastermind of all those programs. His explanation of the \\"SIN EATER\\" was the main moral of the story.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is excellent and ranks up there with the best of the other Bourne flicks perhaps even better. The movie starts a little slow trying to aim the viewer on the justification of killing their latest assassin program Outcome. Then at exactly 30 minutes into the movie the action starts and keeps you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie. Blueray makes a difference.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner and Rachel Wieisz were superb in their acting. They played their parts very well. Renner was an excellent agent whose part had to stand up to the footsteps of Damon and did so successfully. Rachel as the mad scientist was very believable. I hope to see all the actors and actresses of BL along with Damon to be in the next sequel. BL is a very entertaining movie. I highly RECOMMEND IT.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I gave this book a top rating because of the masterful way Doris Goodwin delineated the members<br />of Lincoln's cabinet, and of Lincoln himself.  We learn more of Lincoln's great political expertise.  I think every one should read this book about our greatest president.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|A sly little takeoff on Great Expectations. Sir Terry has a wonderful command of the English language. If you have never read any of his stuff, like the Disc World series, you are less for it.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Had a fun adventure with this book great ending not a whole lot of closure hoping for a sequel please
B003CN5B6K|5.0|&#34;White Collar&#34; is a delightful television series.  Matt Bomer is simply gorgeous -- one of those rare men who are actually physically beautiful -- a pleasure just to stare at; but the actors are all excellent, the stories are clever and inevitably entertaining, and the relationships are a pleasure to observe.  I'm especially pleased that the series features a happily-married couple (&#34;Suit&#34; and &#34;Mrs. Suit&#34;) who are genuine helpmates and fun to-boot.  I also like the interaction between Neil and Mozzi and the growing trust and friendship between Neil and Peter.<br /><br />If you like &#34;Hustle&#34; or &#34;Burn Notice&#34; or &#34;Leverage&#34; I imagine you'd enjoy &#34;White Collar&#34;.  I'm just glad to have one more television series -- in a dwindling pool -- that isn't about murder, serial killers, twisted anti-heroes, lawyers, doctors, or failed marriages.  Hooray for &#34;White Collar&#34;!
051755075X|5.0|David Ogilvy's writing style is pretty anecdotal, but coming from a man who lived, breathed and slept advertising for many years the anecdotes come from his experiences.  His reasons behind his views on copywriting come from a number of polls and his experience.  For those of you who are quick to dismiss that his anecdotal advice doesn't apply to today's marketplace, you're wrong.  His advice holds just as true 30 years ago as it does today.  The only difference is that we have more advertising mediums available to us.  I will certainly read and re-read this book again for years to come.
B000O77SRC|4.0|&#34;Die Hard&#34; was the first modern action movie I saw and it took my breath away when I did.  It's exciting, humorous, and fun, and has held-up pretty well over the years.  It's always enjoyable to watch Alan Rickman -- the leading villain in this picture -- and Bruce Willis is quite good as the hero.  This is not at all a realistic movie, and some of it is a bit campy, but it's all in fun and can provide a good escape of an evening.
B002VECMAE|1.0|Look, I love bad movies provided that they're unapologetically funny enough to make me laugh until tears start seeping out of my eyes, like Orgazmo.  No, this movie was really awful and it was boring.  Too many dull scenes for a comedy, and the ending confirmed that this movie is a major timewaster.
B008602KQI|4.0|A little predictable just like any movie of it's kind. I look forward to the second installment this year in November.
0896898288|5.0|I love all the civil war type fabrics. Great ideas for blocks and loved the stories. Not a sit and read cover to cover book. I pick it up occasionally and read a few at a time - usually when I'm looking through the book for a pattern.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the real deal. you can do anything you want build craft kill best game ever. I also own the PC version and although this is still in the alpha it still has many of the features of the full game, for example, it has the much wanted corner steps that make builds look MUCH more cool. so basically BUY THIS GAME.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't always read books but I'm glad I purchased this and read the book first.. it truthfully made a big impact on my life... it helps show a different way to view life. You will not regret this.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Such a different view point to start with and a great set of characters too. Even better is that more characters are woven into the story as it develops.<br />Many twists to the story that lead to new developments.<br />Loved it, will start the next book soon.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A great and unusual angle for magic is slowly revealed in this excellent novella.  This book will make me read more by Sanderson.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I loved the lessons in this book. I visited Paris last year, and we noticed right away how nicely behaved the children were there.<br />This book explains why, and I am so glad I read it, as i now have a child and want to make sure he doesn't grow up to be a typical obnoxious Western-raised brat.<br />the author does a good (and humorous) job of describing the differences in the way American and French children are raised, through her own experience as an American mother in Paris. She introduces the concept of the &#34;child king&#34;, who rules the parents through being the absolute center of attention at all times. I've seen this so many times, not being able to have an adult conversation because someone's five year old is pitching a fit or interrupting and whining. This seems to be the way most Americans raise their children, mistakenly thinking they are doing them a favor.<br />i enjoyed most of the book , except sometimes the author rambled on too much about other topics in her life that didn't relate to the main subject. I admit i didn't care much to read about her own personal foibles as an American abroad - i just wanted the lowdown on French childrearing.<br />Overall a great read though, highly recommended to anyone, especially those who don't want to raise a &#34;child king&#34;.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was a great book, first SK novel I read so I can't compared to his other books. He follows (but is not limited) by the historical facts to move the story. I appreciate that he didn't try to reinvent history to write about some spicy conspiracy theory. I loved the ending it was very charming.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Don't want to write something you all already know. Great show and you never know who will be the next main character to become a bitter (or walker),all depends on what side of the tracts you hang out on. The next season can't get here soon enough...
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This is not old Paramore.  Is that important?  Yes.  No, it's not a slam; two of the founding members have left so yes it's kinda obvious that it will sound different without them.  So where are Paramore as a group?  The album proves that no one is irreplaceable, so this album is a hearty \\"wave goodbye\\" to the disenchanted brothers.  The fact that Paramore has soldiered on - indeed successfully - has nailed the doubt issue.  Yes, they can survive.  A lot of new textures and grooves are here and if you're expecting \\"That's What You Get\\" or \\"Misery Business\\" you're going to be left out in the cold.  Again...new band members.  So the old groove ain't gonna be there.  Having said that, the new stuff - tho different - is easily some of their best work ever.  Haley's voice goes in to some strange territory on a few numbers but she's still on form and still able to pound out the new material with conviction and feeling.  There are a ton of excellent songs here both to keep old fans and draw new ones in.  \\"Daydreaming\\" is easily the best song released this year by anyone.  \\"Proof,\\" \\"Ain't It Fun\\" and \\"Part Two\\" are excellent, catchy songs.  Out of five stars, I give this sixteen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Me and my daughter love this game. We love all Temple run games. Thank you for leading me to this. Please keep making more!
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Downloaded this app and found out that they will give you one free download a day!!!!  After that they charge $1.49 for each download even though the downloads can be accessed on the internet free!  This app is misleading and a definte thumbs down.  There are other better apps out there that are truly free.<br />The PRO version still costs for downloads exceeding one per day!!! What is up with that?

B00B99KJR0|4.0|This is a fun three-in-a-row game with challenging levels, especially when you're approaching 80 days. This game is simple, with no confusing powerups. I enjoyed all of the levels, but the really challenging ones are really hard (but not impossible).

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague Inc. is an incredibly addictive game. You start the game by picking a disease type, and then naming your disease. After naking your disease, you get to help it grow and mature by choosing its symptoms, abilities, and contagions. I have not tried the Nuerax Worm yet, (spelling?) but I highly suggest the Necora Virus pack, because it brings an entirely new gameplay. You still make a disease, except now you can turn people into zombies. You can make them more effective, and they added cool new sounds. All in all, great game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game and very addictive. Really enjoy playing it and it makes you think, would really enjoy more games like this one
B00BC0JI6O|4.0|I was nervous about this one. I remember how hard it was for Spock's Beard to weather the loss of Neal Morse. That first album without him was rough. But from the first track, this effort was sounding sweet.  My opinion is that each song just keeps building higher as this goes along. I think the Ted Leonard track \\"Submerged\\" is very worthy for radio airplay (but I would assume I'll never hear it on the radio). Thinking about this, I think it's time to throw it on again. This is one I will keep coming back to. Ryo Okomoto is the big star on this one in my opinion. He just keeps pulling out new original sounds. Buy it!

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Surprisingly good, wasn't sure what to expect but I will be following this advice and hopefully my wife will read this book too
B0042XA2U4|4.0|I absolutely love the movie and wanted to read the book. Usually the books blow the movie out of the water, but sadly that was not the case this time around. I dind't feel the connection between Holly and her friends or Holly and Gerry in the book. In my opinion there was a lot of filler in the book that didn't add to the story, it took away from it.
B000FA675C|5.0|I owned this book in hardcover within days of its initial release.  I jumped at the chance to grab it for free in ebook form!  I love, LOVE this book!  This is how you keep a reader interested!  Yes, yes, yes!  If you have never read this, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!  See what all the fuss is about!
B000035P5E|4.0|Excellent movie!  I had on VHS for years and was eager to get a version on DVD.  Great acting by Kate Nelligan and Donald Sutherland, and really well edited...highly recommend.
B000FA675C|5.0|The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is an international best seller that deals with a major cover up by the Christian church that spans thousands and thousands of years. Typically when you involve religion in the topic, it's bound to get many different types of reactions and feelings from the crowd and this is no different. I mean religion does sell right? This is the perfect example of an author cashing in on that aspect. However, when reading this book, I just took it for what it is and that is a book that is suppose to be highly suspenseful and an action thriller. Oh and of course,  discovering the big mystery that is suppose to shake the Christian church to its foundation. The Da Vinci Code I can say without a shadow of a doubt, is an excellent book from start to finish provided that you take it for what it is. This can be very hard obviously if you yourself is a devoted Christian because you'll probably not like what the author says about your religion here in this book even though it's considered a fiction piece of work. If you can get past that though, this book is the ultimate definition of a page turner!<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code basically is about what happens when everything is not as simple as we'd like things to be. We were always told the story of Jesus Christ through the Bible as it is suppose to detail an accurate picture of his life. But what if not everything we read is accurate and that the Bible is an actual cover up for the truth of what actually happened with Jesus Christ? Everyone loves a good conspiracy theory and The Da Vinci Code cashes in on that notion when members of an ultra secret brotherhood charged with protecting some important documents that reveal the actual truth about the life of Jesus Christ are murdered.<br /><br />It's surprising to find out that the entire book takes place within the span of just one night. Not many authors can do this and I believe this author uses the same tactic with his other books as well. The problem here for many is that there just isn't enough time to develop the characters. Therefore, what I read from many reviewers is that due to shallow characters, they don't feel an emotional attachment to the story and that they don't care about the outcome. I usually promote strong character growth as well but I find the story in the Da Vinci Code good enough for me to give it a pass in this case.<br /><br />The writing is superb from Dan Brown and this I believe is the first book I have read from this popular author. I find that the book immediately gripped me right from the beginning. I do admit that I had my doubts in the beginning. Like other readers, I usually find books on the best seller list as overrated but The Da Vinci Code is anything but that. The author really sets an incredible pace and he has a knack for not giving away too much all in one go. He slowly lures you in and you'll definitely be saying to yourself \\"just one more chapter!\\". Some might not like this as if I remember correctly, it's exactly at the halfway point of this book that the exact mystery is revealed to the readers.<br /><br />As a thriller and mystery, you're going to get your usual doses of action set pieces and the author gives just enough to satisfy our thirsts without drowning us. What I also love about reading The Da Vinci Code is that the author sprinkles in a bit of historical education throughout the book. Those were definitely a blast to read through because typically, we normally don't relate or think about it from a historian's point of view. And believe it or not, you'll be rushing to your computer throughout the book searching for images that the author talks about. So not only are we getting a fantastic suspense thriller in the book, we are also educating ourselves in the process!<br /><br />Whether you believe in what the author writes here is definitely up to you. Everyone loves a good conspiracy and I'm sure The Da Vinci Code stirred up a hornet's next when it was published.I personally am not a completely devoted and religious person but I do believe in a higher being. I definitely read this book with an open mind and it was pretty shocking to find what the author had to say although many others have reported that Dan Brown basically took the ideas of what other authors/historians have written in other lesser known books and used it here in The Da Vinci Code. Nonetheless, this book was a complete page turner and I could hardly put it down! I think this might take the spot for the fastest book read in my collection.I personally am not a completely devoted and religious person but I do believe in a higher being.

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I use this with my MBP Retina 2012 running Windows 8 64bit on Bootcamp. Installation is a breeze the first time I plugged it Windows immediately recognized and install the driver. I performed copying test and found the speed is about 2-3 times faster than my old USB 2.0 Gigabit Ethernet adapter. So far I'm very happy with the purchase and definitely would recommend it.

B00BHMF578|5.0|I really like the &#34;based on a true story&#34; movies, and its a huge bonus when its actually interesting. It reminds me of movies like Syriana, Black Hawk Down, and other movies in that vein.

B00BGIBVP8|3.0|We enjoyed it, for the most part, but i haven't really recommended it to any one. Wait for it to be free on Amazon Prime.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I have read all of the Niki Heat novels and I can't wait for the next one. I started reading these books because of the ABC tv series Castle.  The show is also awesome.  I have all seasons on dvd waiting for season 5 to be released and dvr Castle every Monday.  Both the characters on the show and in the books provide easy, entertaining reading.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I have never before heard or thought much about the affects of amnesia on the patient or their family.  This book allows the reader to get the sense of how limited a life would necessarily be for someone  with this illness.  After Christine starts to write her journal, we get to gradually collect a fuller picture of her life as she is learning and trying to put the pieces together herself.  And we can feel the confusion and fear she feels as she tries to decide who she can/should trust.  Very interesting concept.
B007NESBK2|5.0|This is a great concert! Excellent visuals and sounds amazing.Almost looked and sounded better than when I saw her live!
1400052181|5.0|I loved this book! Usually, I have the hardest time getting through nonfiction books, but this book was absolutely no trouble to follow. I learned so much and I was so touched by the story of Henrietta and her children. I think Rebecca Skloot gave the Lacks Family the voice that was silenced for so long. And, I just love Skloot's writing style and can not wait to read more. I highly recommend this book because the events that occurs in the medical history of Henrietta are things that still go on in the world of medicine. Definitely, an eye opener.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Loved it...hope the third in the series is out by the time I finish \\"Winter of the World\\", the second.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|First off, thank god these 5 are already released! I can't imagine the tension I would have felt finishing Book 2 or 3 without having the next readily available.<br /><br />Wool is an incredible book series involving a underground silo surrounded by what seems to be a destroyed planet. Part 1 sucks you in, part 2 bores you a little (I'll admit), but ends with a bang that goes into part 3-5.<br />3-5 will blow you away.<br /><br />All your questions get slowly answered, right at the perfect pace, where you get just enough and then you move forward a bit and develop entirely new questions that end up being answered.<br /><br />I've read into the Shift saga a bit. Wool is definitely supperior in terms of overall story, but having read Wool I feel the Shift saga is sort of a must-have since it goes even deeper into answering questions you're bound to have at the end.<br /><br />Just go read the first part, it's free on amazon on their kindle reader. If you like it, if you like how it's written, go ahead and grab this saga set (or the paperback) and I guarentee you won't be disappointed.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Is awesome but things get expensive. I think u should get it. Rock on ! Love JESUS Christ and go to heaven.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|If you've played Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts on the DS, this really has nothing new to offer.  However, for $0.99, it was a steal to have Maxwell and the cute illustrations and fun music on my kindle.  The bigger screen (compared to the DS) really makes the graphics pop.
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|Not anything like the classic movie! I was surprised at all the extra parts of the book that the movie does not have in it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The book is full of believable characters that you come to care about.  There is a &#34;qwerkiness&#34; that brings both humor and tenderness to them.  With different treatment of the characters and a different ending, this could have been a stereo-typical romance read.  Jojo Meyers made the story so much more.  I did find it to be a good tear-jerker.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a very good app in the Amazon Appstore. It is awesome. it's good to watch my kids play,seeing they can handle a city
0618526412|4.0|The book takes place in a small, poor southern town in America  and focuses on the inner turmoil of it's characters and their interactions with each other. Each one of the characters is looking for love and acceptance and feels greatly their separation from society. The characters are alike in that they are all haunted by what they perceived  as their differences from the rest of the world. They feel  no one can understand them, yet as the book unfolds we witness their deep and rich inner life and incredible qualities. The main character Singer is a deaf mute who has a close relationship with another deaf mute but their friendship ends when he is committed to the asylum. Singer goes on to meet other characters in the book and becomes their confidant and they love him yet, he still clings to his former friend.He is unable  to duplicate the connection that he  had found in his previous friend perhaps because they were both deaf.This is a book of the quest for  a heart connection  with another person and society. The book  also explore racial issues that were prominent at the time and place of this setting.  The characters  spend their time longing  for peace, love and acceptance. This is not a light reading and I ached for the sadness in their hearts. The book's structure gives an in depth picture of each it's  character then it documents their interactions and how they live their lives. I personally found the book interesting and the writing very good but it left me longing for the characters to find happiness in their brilliance of their differences rather than feel shame and loss. I believe it would be a very good book to have teenagers read to get the perception of  a minority or a challenged person face and to realize we are all alike and our differences are what enriches the world .

0060936223|5.0|There has always been an intensity and love for Patti Smith from other artists that is rare. She lays her life all out in a compelling and beautiful memoir of her friendship and life-long love affair with Robert Mapplethorpe. They are lovers and brother and sister and best friends. There is mystical trust between them from the time they met in 1967 until 1989 when Robert died of aids.<br /><br />The title Just Kids comes from an older woman who asked her husband if they should take their picture because they were artists, and the husband replied that they were \\"just kids.\\"<br /><br />Patti grew up in a loving Irish family. She had a baby at nineteen with a boy who didn't mean much to her. She gave the baby up to a fine family and moved to New York where she lived in the streets. It was at Brentano's bookstore where she first laid eyes on Robert Mapplethorpe, who later, out of the blue, appeared on the street to save her from an uncomfortable dinner date she had accepted because she was starving. It turns out they were both homeless, and from that moment on, and as she said many times, they took care of each other.<br /><br />One small episode symbolized them in these years. They saw a Bonnie and Clyde movie poster and Robert admired the tagline: \\"They're young. They're in Love. They rob banks.\\"<br /><br />They save enough for an apartment that they decorate with found objects and Robert's painting. Patti is the breadwinner throughout their relationship. Robert doesn't have the ability to hold a regular job.<br /><br />The relationship that seemed so beautiful started to unwind. Mapplethorpe turned bizarre and withdrew. Patti secured a job at Scribners and decided to break up with him. He tried to get her to take him back and threatened that if she didn't that he would start sleeping with men. It was over.<br /><br />Patti traveled in Paris and visited the graves of Rimbaud and Jim Morrison. Robert moved to San Francisco and came back with a boyfriend. They continued to be close friends and eventually their relationship was renewed, and they were back together.<br /><br />Mapplethorpe had come from a family with an authoritarian father, and I trace that relationship to many of his issues. He became immersed in the homosexual underground, including S&M.<br /><br />They hit rock bottom when Robert became very sick with a terrible case of Gonorrhea, and they lived in a rundown hotel for junkies that they had to sneak out of because they couldn't afford to pay up, but even there, she found beauty and friendship.<br /><br />The most disturbing aspect and the parts that might make you wince are Robert's obsession with dark or evil forces. He seemed to be searching or open to a Faustian pact.<br /><br />Life changed when they moved into the Chelsea Hotel where they met other artists, including William Burroughs, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Robert Rauchenberg, Allen Ginsburg.... They hung out at Max's Kansas City with members of Warhol's factory and others. Robert thought if he could meet Andy Warhol that he would see Robert as an equal.<br /><br />To make money Robert along with Jim Carroll hustled their bodies to men. Robert didn't know if he did it for money or pleasure.<br /><br />Their relationship could not survive Robert's obvious preference, but they remained each other's \\"artist and muse\\" during their fascinating ascents as their careers began to blossom.<br /><br />One of the many treasures of this book is that it is so intimate. This is a breathtaking story of two special people in the iconic period of the '60s and '70s in Manhattan.to be close friends and eventually their relationship was renewed, and they were back together.<br /><br />Mapplethorpe had come from a family with an authoritarian father, and I trace that relationship to many of his issues.

B00AHSGNJM|5.0|The kids love this movie they will play will watch it all day and over and over. It's worth the download.  A very good movie
B008220C38|1.0|I've never read Anna Karenina so I was hoping to get a taste of what this acclaimed novel is about. But this film is bizarre and so awful that after 15 minutes watching it I just turned it off.  Surely Tolstoy didn't write anything like this!
B0054S6N04|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. I've read some other books by Linda Howard. To me, this one was different from some of her other novels...darker, more complex. And while the mystery was pretty easy to figure out, I still found this to be an exciting read. In fact, the only reason I'm not giving it more stars is because the basic premise--that creating a &#34;scandalous&#34; lists creates a huge media frenzied uproar--is a bit ridiculous. Perhaps this is an issue of the book being outdated, but the list didn't even seem all that scandalous. I spent the first half the book scratching my head in bewilderment as to why The List allegedly created such an uproar. However, if you can get past that I think you'll find that Howard has delivered another fun, sexy, exciting love story that's sure to make you smile at the end.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|Excellent picture and great entertainment.  Will plan to see it again.  Anthony Hopkins is great for the part.  Expect more of this.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game! However, it is getting harder and harder to get items you need to complete a room. I wish they wouldn't make some pieces so difficult.9 months of playing to still not complete room because I need 1 item?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|After reading the book(s), I found that this was done well.  The characters held up and I'm waiting for more.
B000FA675C|5.0|I loved this book from the first time I read it.  I find Dan Brown's writting to be entertaining and compelling.  I got the 10th anniversary kindle edition of the Da Vinci Code and I have completely enjoyed reading it on Kindle.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I have to say, I really enjoyed this story. It was sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and the ending was just right.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very nice game! If you're looking to kill time, this game is for you! Love it! Recommended for kids of all ages.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Let me first state that I love this game. You can type in virtually anything and it appears. That said, it misses the best features from the ds version. There is no challenge mode, no level creator, and when I got the ecpansion it only gave me the levels until i exited the app. When i tryed to buy them again, it said i already bought them. Also, what the heck do ypu use ollars for! in the ds version you bought avatars and worlds with them. they have no purpose in this game.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book! The lilt of the Irish language was so inviting. It was full of laughter, tragedy, and an ending that filled the heart full!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Bought as a gift for my sister. She will be graduating college quite soon, and she has enjoyed watching parts of the concert special on YouTube. We also both saw the Hollywood movie, which was great but the singing in that movie (especially the singing of Russell Crowe's Javert) just doesn't quite compare to the singing in this! For me, the actor who plays Javert is especially excellent in the role, far superior to Crowe's performance!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this one because it gives actual things to accomplish, plus you have an option to&quot;in-app&quot;purchase to upgrade your sharks, BUT you can get achievements and coins to keep from purchasing with money, and it's not tsar hard to achieve, just eat eat eat and grow to upgrade to next shark!!!
B00008NRL8|3.0|I bought a tango CD and the bonus CD was not. I don't think we could listen to samples beforehand. I don't need to buy surprises!
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|Have watched this movie many times in different forms since it was releassed.  Love the music  Love the dancing.  Loved John<br />Travolta since we were both much younger and Olivia was also great in this movie.<br /><br />Purchased it in its most current form so I can watch it when ever my mood needs cheering.
B0076DELIG|4.0|An intriguing storyline with typical Bosh action.  I would reccomend this to everyone that likes a good story with unexpected twists that are reasonable in the story line.  I can only hope that Bosh never retires.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Love this movie.  Still love Patrick Swayze.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|. Robin Hobb&#34;s main character, Fitz, finally comes to understand his place in the world. His relationship with his daughter is a real highlight. As always, well-crafted characters who evolve.  She also writes excellent action sequences, which sometimes come out of nowhere. Occasionally overly descriptive but a wonderful rendering of an alternate universe. JK
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is about the author's near death experience (NDE), which had some differences from other NDE stories ie read. Here is a true dyed-in-the-wool physician/academician convinced of the accuracy and infallibility of his training and thinking, then Oops! It was a bad day indeed!<br /><br />What sets this book apart is how well documented and researched is the medical information presented, with extensive bibliography and appendices on causes related to his very bad day.<br /><br />The ending was a surprise and a delight!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using Evernote ever since I got my HD Kindle Fire 8.9 w/external keyboard in February. This app is the main reason I use my Kindle. It has made a huge difference in my life. You can take notes where ever you go. You don't have to worry about the app crashing or you losing the information you've entered since it is saved on a cloud. What I also love about this is that, you can access your account on a regular computer and access the notes you've created from your Kindle.  This really has helped me a lot in getting organized, staying on top of my tasks, writing little reminder notes. It is super user-friendly with an easy, simple layout. It is just what I needed. I've tried other apps but I simply love EVERNOTE!!!  Springpad is really good app as well which I use for other purposes.<br /><br />Thank you so much!!!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I just started reading this on Saturday and read for almost 5 hours before I could pull myself out of it! This will be a very good set of books if the rest of them are anything like the first one. I am already anticipating this evening when I can get back to it!
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Another favorite movie that I will be able to watch when I want to even without internet access. Also have Grease 2 and watch it as well.
B00BEIYM42|5.0|I saw this film yesterday at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia (coordinated by the Philadelphia Film Society). I truly enjoyed it. I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't list the two actors with major roles and well-known names - Terrence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave - in the main listing. But no big deal.<br /><br />The film is basically a fictional version of the documentary \\"Young @ Heart\\" which came out a few years ago. (If you liked that film, you'll enjoy this as well.)It's about a group of British senior citizens who enter a choral competition by singing rock and heavy metal songs. It's funny and heartwarming. There is a serious back-story too which adds to the enjoying. And the music is great with Stamp performing a Billy Joel song and Celine Dion crooning a new Diane Warren-penned song over the closing credits.<br /><br />I'll certainly await the DVD of this film to see what \\"bonus features\\" they added.<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00797MB0O|1.0|You might as well keep looking.  It is an entire movie about a spoiled brat that never changed.  Its boring and it is impossible to relate or connect with Theron's character, which makes it impossible to feel bad for her.  Waste of time.
1613771355|5.0|The Last Unicorn has been a novel and a movie, but in some ways I like the graphic novel version best of all. It combines stunning visuals with Peter Beagle's text. This is a very faithful adaptation of the novel with some influence from the movie, although Renae DeLiz's artwork is of a much more realistic style. The art has bold colors that really jump off the page. As for the story, Peter Gillis wisely stuck to Beagle's language in the novel. Many lines are simply lifted from the book. Gillis also does a good job incorporating more of the story than the movie did. We get to see more of Haggsgate and more of Captain Cully's band (although Haggard's 4 men at arms are absent).<br /><br />There is a regular edition of this graphic novel at [[ASIN:1600108512 The Last Unicorn]]. The only difference I can tell is that the Deluxe version contains two short stories, one by Gillis and one by Beagle, although neither is set in the world of the Last Unicorn. ALso, the Deluxe version contains more art and comic covers. Note that this Deluxe version does not come signed, but you can buy it directly from Conlan Press and get it autographed if that's important to you.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I didn't even finish watching it! It was mindless, boring, and was there a plot to this movie?..I don't think so!
1616550414|4.0|The book Hyrule Historia is appropriate for this tome. It is huge and brimming with information. The book has sections with concept art and the timeline for each Zelda game.<br /><br />I won't go on gushing about this book -  there are enough reviews here that do that. I do want to point out two issues with the book - things I hope Nintendo will consider for future books like this.<br /><br />First, the emphasis really was on Skyward Sword. The first third of the book was almost exclusively SS material. For many fans, SS is not the best entry in the series. It would have been nice to have had more balance in the book, to see some of the type of material for the other games.<br /><br />Second, given that Nintendo developed most of the Zelda games in-house, there were huge opportunities to dig deeply into the making of the games and uncover why the designers included certain characters or story elements. The book is unfortunately fairly thin on this part. There are a few side comments next to some of the pictures, but they seem like they're written by somebody with no inside knowledge of the game development process (comments like \\"I wonder what the idea behind this concept was?\\")<br /><br />Overall, this is easily a \\"must-buy\\" for any Zelda fan. It's amazing that Nintendo hasn't made more books like this - given that many lesser game franchises have \\"making of books\\" - and I hope the response to Hyrule Historia shows Nintendo that the market is there. I'd love to see a Metroid book like this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series! Sometimes you can predict what's going to happen and then other times you have no clue. Just like life!

1572814136|5.0|U.S. Games makes something like 100 different Tarot decks, but this is my favorite. It adheres faithfully to the original illustrations, except that they are all in brighter colors. I use these cards regularly and they are particularly easy to focus on.<br /><br />I strongly recommend using these cards with Joan Bunnings \\"Learning the Tarot: A Tarot Book for Beginners,\\" a product which I have reviewed separately. This book is really for intermediate stage tarot users as well as beginners, and you can proceed to learn the tarot, or learn more about it, at your own pace.[[ASIN:1578630487 Learning the Tarot: A Tarot Book for Beginners]]
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Well Ninja kiwi works a masterpiece again. If you think SAS zombie assault 3 was good, then you'll love this. It's more than worth the money. No internet required!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was really good.  I read it in less than a week.  I wanted to read the book before I went to the movie.  The movie was not good at all, I had expected it to be much better than it was.  But this book was very good.
1439102430|4.0|Interesting as always. I have read all Kathy Reich's &#34;Bones&#34; books. As in most series they have gotten pretty predictable. I find I get very frustrated with Dr. Brennan's way of taking over a case and not working with the police better.  Since she has a good working relationship with Ryan and he knows her strengths, he would listen to her opinion. I just can't understand an intelligent person constantly putting herself in extreme danger so often. For a smart woman, she can be pretty dumb at times.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Great movie and Liam Neeson is a great actor.  This came across as a deal of the day, so I couldn't pass the value up.  Great additional to any DVD Collection.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Wish I could give 4 stars, but the finished product falls short.  Okay, so not everybody can be Orson Welles.  For those who get lost early in the movie, try doing the unthinkable and run the commentary on the first viewing. Strong cast all around.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Big fan of Dr. Seuss and we loved the movie in the theaters.  This came across as a deal of the day and we really couldn't beat the price so we picked it up.  Very good movie for the entire family and especially for the movie nights.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I just finish the 45th DVD and the last of the series.  Oh my GOD, it was GREAT!!  I was a little leery in the beginning because some customers had problems with the cardboard cases that held the DVD's.  I had no problems removing the DVD's.  ALL the DVD's played perfectly on my new late 2012 27&#34; iMac.  If you enjoyed &#34;The West Wind&#34; series I urge you to consider &#34; The Complete Series Collection&#34;.  I loved this show when it first came out and continued to watch the reruns on any channel I could.  The cast of character are superb and there quality on the recordings in superb.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Great movie. came across as a deal of the day and I couldn't beat the price and had to buy it.  Great addition to any movie collection.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|A new album, another predictable result from Phosphorescent - another great album.  Song for Zula has to be one of the best songs I have heard in a long time.  Matthew's aching vocals are perfect for me anyway when he sings &#34;I saw love, you see it came to me.  It puts it face up to my face, so I could see, and then i saw love, disfugure me, it to something that I am not recognizing.&#34;  Ride On / Right On, Muchacho's Tune are also very stong.  The rest  of the album is pretty good.  Give me a campfire, something to drink, and some Phosphorescent just behind the speakers and I find I can hold that song and live in side there never all alone.  If you like Phosphorescent, you will love this album.  If you do not know them yet, do yourself a favor and give them a chance, you will not be disappointed.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Some good dialog and characters, not sure how true to history it was but enjoyable nonetheless.<br />I'd recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thougth this was a good read, but not a great one.  It would be a good one for summer.  The characters were quite interesting, quite flawed, but then again who isn't.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark Cuban's rags to riches story is both fascinating and inspiring. To the budding entrepreneur, Cuban's unadulterated yet practical tips can be more valuable than a paycheck.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The best story line I've ever seen, awsome the way they introduce characters, My family stays glued to the TV.
0385535147|3.0|I agree with another reviewer that the quality of John Grisham's books since he wrote the exceptional \\"A Time To Kill\\" and \\"The Firm\\" has been uneven over the years. In this book, the point of view shifts were confusing at times and he took forever to unravel the story. I seldom skip pages but I did this time so I probably missed key points. However, Mr. Grisham is still a masterful story teller and I'll always at least attempt to read his books. He did an excellent job, in my opinion, of keeping the reader in the dark about the painstaking plan unfolding throughout the novel. Be prepared to yawn in a few places and feel a building sense of impatience but overall it's a good read especially if you're enjoying leisure time anyway.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book has a lot of first hand accounts of combat and was a quick read. It was a tad rougher than others I've read but the historical significance makes it a must have.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I love mi mac air 11 but i like to be snappy when i surf the web or watch a video on netflix. I hope the next version of the air got 2 minidisplayports. If i use this adapter i cant use the video adapter to my monitor.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is a latter-model Dualshock 3, with the increased battery capacity.  I've hooked it to my PC and tablet via Bluetooth as well, the triggers and sticks are quite sensitive, this is a good portable controller for things like that.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|It does what it says no more no less. I love that my macbook air now can use the charger of my brother's macbook pro.
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|I absolutely agree with most others comments that is an enjoyable yarn. I must admit I really enjoy a book with a good long read and I was extremely disappointed at the brevity of the books in this chronicle. If you want a standalone story then these are not the books for you. I am just about to commence the 3rd book and although I enjoyed reading number 2 it was incredibly annoying the way the book ended so suddenly.<br />Although I think Jeffrey Archer is a good novelist I would be reluctant in buying future books with this obvious ploy to buy more books.<br />Not really value for money.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This was a typical kid movie. My 16 year old video gamer probably got the biggest kick out of, and it provided a night of family fun for the rest of us.
0062238868|5.0|American Sniper is a gutrenthcing, hard-hitting story of one man who had a tough but I feel a personally rewarding journey through the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan. I feel deep inside honored and proud of Chris Kyle defending not only Americans in Iraq and war zones, but any other military members as well. When Chris contemplated a second tour and re-enlisting for another 4-5 years of putting his country first, his wife felt a loss and anger towards her husband for not putting his wife and family first. Chris Kyle will always have my respect and admiration for helping to protect the ideas and values that make our country great. While some can argue his motives for leaving a wife and child for another tour as not feeling Chris Kyle felt strongly that in his training to be a warrior for our country he was being with his wife and family. It's sad to know that he's not with us and didn't fall in battle for his country. This book is a great read and I recommend it strongly.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I really enjoy films based on true life facts. I'm sure some of the things in this video were for dramatization, but all in all it was a good movie well worth watching again.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Late last year I read Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and, like the best seller lists reflect, I wasn't the only one who liked it.  In talking to other avid readers I learned that a lot of them had also enjoyed her earlier two books. Based on several conversations that went the same way, I decided to purchase both Dark Places and Sharp Objects.  I read Dark Places first and did not like the book at all.  I usually finish a book I start, especially if it comes with several recommendations, but that book was a struggle.  I dislike books about violence but if it's the underlying subject, which progresses toward a trial or resolution, I will read it when it's been recommended.  But graphic violence is not my cup of tea. This book was way too descriptive for my taste.  There is enough violence in real life, I use fiction to relax and learn.  I would never recommend that book without giving my opinion on it's content.<br /><br />And, I still read Sharp Objects, mostly because I'd purchased it and because the story seemed more about a &#34;damaged&#34; person rather than about violence.  I thought it would be similar to Gone Girl in that respect.  And it was.  But, it wasn't that good.  I didn't learn a thing that I didn't already know about her affliction and I thought the plot was rather weak.  I was waiting for the mystery to surface and it did but it was barely enough to hold my interest. I couldn't really engage with any of the characters from the small town in Missouri and Ms. Glynn didn't paint a pretty picture or an engaging personality among any of them.  The main character was pretty pathetic and should have been old enough to recognize her problem and get help.  Or, at least get away from the assignment that was so mentally difficult for her to cope with, especially when she had the chance.<br /><br />I thought it was a waste of my time, and I should have just been content with liking Gone Girl.  I must be more careful about recommendations in the future.  My fault entirely.  By the other reviews there are many out there that disagree with me. I'm going back to choices among historical fiction.  That's where I belong.

B00002N9ER|1.0|These clips kept my 4 cell mag light handy at the top of the basement stairs for about 10 months. I rarely used that light as I have smaller flashlights stashed around the house. I'm guessing the flashlight was placed in and removed from these clips 5-6 times over the 10 months. The last time I pulled the mag light out of the clips, half of the top clip launched down the stairs with a loud snap. I really like the concept, but the plastic is just too brittle.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|American movie makers have become lazy. Too many now just take a great international movie and remake it frame by frame and add nothing and do not make a better movie. In most cases the remake is worse. Such is the case here. Quarrantine was good but Rec is better and the leading actress much hotter and cuter. The movie gives a real sense of you being there and gets really tense as it goes along. The ending was perfect for Rec 2.
0525953728|5.0|Autobiographies written by American heroes are always good. This book was no disappointment. Kind of wish I'd read it sooner.
0385349947|5.0|Im only about half way through the book and I love it! I have 3 small kids and a full time job, while also trying to run a business, so its hard to read anything in its entirety these days. I have to laugh at the people who talk about her upbringing, which (to me)is completely irrelevant.  Her viewpoints apply to most women no matter which field they work in. I hope to meet her one day and shake her hand or maybe high five. She has inspired me and hopefully all of the women that read her book.

Please add an orange earnet to match the orange boots. We Ladies like to match our outfits.

B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I like this game a lot.  It has very relaxing music and after you 'learn' how to move the Kindle it's fairly easy.  Even my grand kids enjoy it and they are five and three years old.. :)
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Words cannot express how amazing this movie is!  I took my 9 and 11 year old daughters to see it, as my youngest is a tiger fanatic.  I had no idea it was a best selling book (have since bought the book).  I was left in tears at many parts, due to its beautiful theme and story.  The acting was stellar, pulling you into the character. Cinematography was beyond words on its brilliance, just stunning.  Even my husband loved it all.  My kids still ask me philosophical questions about it, it leaves you with many questions, some that can be answered, some not so easily.  But that is the beauty of it, we never truly know all the answers, do we?
B0035JRVR8|5.0|I have never watch this movie until now.  I have heard of it, but just took the time to watch.  Why?....because I love old movies.  It is so nice to watch something that leaves you feeling good.
B000FA675C|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  You can see why they made it a movie.  The historical data is interesting and well woven into a really interesting and exciting story.  An absolute must read.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is the first book I've read by Adam Johnson. I will look forward to reading more of his books.

B004HD61KE|5.0|I've never read a James Rollins book without loving it. The plot, history and characters always make it interesting. This is no exception. If you're looking for an exciting and thought provoking read, pick this up and then just try to put it down. Its truly one of those novels and you REALLY don't want to set down.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|since I started watching Fringe, I loved it and decided that I had to own all the episodes. This was #1 of 4.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I already own the Lord of the Ring trilogy, so I had to purchase the first in the Hobbit trilogy too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read this book probably a dozen times over the years and love it every single time.  I own a paperback of this but wanted to also have it available on my kindle.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it. I can not wait until the next book in the series comes out so I can finish the story.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The boy who played Pi should have received an Oscar for his performance. It was so magical and real - totally believeable.
B000JCSPG0|4.0|This was an excellent film, comparable to Jurassic Park and other films that successfully fuse scientific concept with character and action.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is one movie that you can see over and over again and still not catch everything that went on in it. The music just takes my breath away
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Hitchens brilliance is so often thrown around at the beginning of a review by fans and readers. I wish to spare you that as you will undoubtly have come to this conclusion by the end of the book. What seemingly could of been a postscript to Hitch-22, was turned into its own book and well worth the price. It is quite funny and sadding at the same time. Hitch had mastered the English language in ways that few could ever had hoped to achive and even in his final hours did not spare us of his genius or abilty to articulate thoughts on such a deep subject. You will not be sorry about this purchase. Rivieting and captivating. It is everything you never knew you wanted from a book and more.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Never caught this movie in the theater. Bought it for my grandkids to see and the loved it and so did I.  Movie came brand new.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I love how relevant this show is!  I was cracking up with almost every episode.  What I enjoy most are each character's punch lines, especially &#34;You're Welcome!&#34;
B004VYYA2K|4.0|Love it and it works greatfor storage she can put all or most of her Barbies in there and still has some room for more
B000FA675C|5.0|Fun read and interesting. A different way to look at the Bible. If true it would change the world for sure
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|A lot of people hated this book, simply because of the screwed up relationship Travis and Abby have. Yes its a terrible whirlwind love, but they aren't trying to change each other or 'fix' each other. They know its an impossible situation. I also LOVED Shep and America being the back up characters, they added a lot of umphh to the story.<br /><br />My only question is, what happens after college? Once the graduate and grow up, somebody is going to have to get a job. The relationship is going to fall apart when they can't constantly see/talk to/text each other every minute of every day. Travis obviously can't function unless he has eye contact with Abby, and she enables him to act that way and lets him treat her as a possession instead of a partner.<br /><br />For a book, it was an amazing, dramatic, touch and go love that was exciting to watch unfold. For real life, it would be a terrible situation to be stuck in. But since I was lucky enough to land an honest stable marriage and use books as a way to experience crazy situations like this - I loved it!
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|Thank God I listened to this on Spotify and did not purchase this CD. It kinds sounds like the \\"China Girl\\" period and I do not like that era of Bowie at all....far too commercial and perfect sounding. Listen on Spotify before you purchase where it is free to stream.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I enjoy playing Angry Birds Rio and my family does, too. Good game and just as good as Fruit Ninja.
6305692572|5.0|It is a classic love story with the difficulties of life and addition. Meg Ryan is great and in her prime days as an actress and Andy Garica is a handsome, sexy guy
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love play this game Flow Free because it keeps you thinking all the time. My entire family plays this games, also. I have recommend to other friends of mine. it's a 5 star rating because it's excellent game to play.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|I enjoyed Sandra Bullock in her role as a drunk who was out of control and rehab at its best. She pulled this one off with no problem.
B007J2TMQ0|3.0|I found this book very interesting but quite a heavy read.  I bought it on Kindle and must say I would prefer it in hard copy.  It is handy to have the maps &#34;on hand&#34; to refer to as you go through the very detailed narrative.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie. A classic movie that everyone must watch, not only because of its brilliance but also because of its modern-day culture significance.
B0000669JL|5.0|Awesome.  Just simply awesome.  Everything I hoped for and more.  I am so grateful for the opportunity to acquire it at a very good price.
B005HSL626|5.0|Have played this game for only two days, and I can tell I`m pretty much addicted to this game! Uh oh!
B002361MLA|4.0|After reading this book I realized how much of my life was spent living in the past instead of being in the moment which is right now<br />I would like to thank the author.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Started watching the Good Wife last year.  Looking forward to seeing the series in order from the beginning.  Good stuff.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love to golf, no seriously, I L O V E to golf, and fish, and hunt and...well you get the picture. Like most men with kids, I don't get to run out and do those things whenever I want because I have responsibilities and I model my life around the following mantra: &#34;When Mamma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy&#34;. So I am constantly looking for ways to make deposits in to the brownie point bank so when the day comes that I need to go on a bender with the boys or spend 3 days not showering in the wilderness I can go on a spending spree, damn the consequences. It was always onsies twosies before this, a diamond tennis bracelet here, a new car there, then I discovered the all sacred, all powerful period drama and never looked back and Downton Abbey takes the cake. This particular set is 525 minutes of pure &#34;leave me alone&#34;, &#34;shush I am watching this&#34;, &#34;going to the girls house to go on an episode marathon&#34;, goodness. Is it the accents? Who knows. The dreams of having footmen and valets? Probably. I am not a scientist, so I don't really care. In fact I bought a new gun the other day and she didn't even ask me about it because some person died that caused multiple phone calls consisting of hours of speculation, and a tear or two.<br /><br />In fact, since Amazon told me this review is anonymous I will admit that I have seen a few episodes and it is not bad. I mean there are no scenes of Kiera Knightly diving in to a fountain, but there is some intrigue, some war scenes on the other season, and they even went hunting in Scotland once, score!<br /><br />So Guys, learn from me, the period drama is the PERFECT gift if you wanted to play in the scramble next weekend.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game isfhn and challenging at the same time.<br />the only complaint that I have to say is the energy,  and how you run out way to fast and you have to wait forever for it to restore.
B00271HAK8|5.0|I honestly don't know any movies from 1986 that are greater than Ferris Bueller. This is my ALL TIME favorite movie, I can watch it all day and laugh like it's my first time seeing it.
B005603236|5.0|Movie was great and the best one that I have seen. I ordered this based on the reviews and they were right. It is better than other DVDs of the same title.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|This USB breaks easily. Usually other brand USB cables are sturdier. the kindle isn't really designed well and this USB makes it really hard to make sure the nib of the port doesn't break everytime you need to fold it a bit.
B00992CF6W|3.0|this is a good app and all but there should be redstone and buckets and other things to build other than just the basic things that it already has
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I ordered this as soon as it became available.  I wish it cost a little bit less, but what can you do?
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|The only comedy show that I can actually laugh with since Friends. Timing is accurate. Everyone needs a Schmidt. Winston is overlooked and does have his own special moments. and Nick and Jess is the new Ross and Rachel.  Love Love Love Love Love Love. The only comedy on air that I dvr currently. The rest just fall flat and make me want slap people. This show makes me laugh with them and want to hang out with them. Love my Nick and Jess as well as Schmidt and CeCe.
B008NQPXKA|3.0|Lee Child seems to make a point of describing Reacher's build in detail - from his 6'5\\" frame, 3XLT clothing, 50\\" chest, and large hands and long arms (that almost drag the ground when he is seated in a chair).  Perhaps this is to reinforce the fact that Reacher is NOT the diminutive Tom Cruise as Hollywood appears to have insisted.  With a freshly broken nose held together with a piece of silver duct tape, Reacher is having a difficult time hitching a ride.  It is a cold night in Nebraska and fifty-six cars have already passed him by.  When number fifty-seven finally stops to offer him a lift Reacher steps into a new adventure that is part suspense thriller and part political commentary, a place where everything and everyone are not what they seem to be.  The only constant is Reacher.  He is still the strong, silent ex-military cop who travels via his thumb and owns only one set of clothes at a time.<br /><br />A WANTED MAN gives us a look at government run hotels, counterterrorism units including the ongoing dual between the FBI, CIA and local law enforcement organizations, the un-surprising disclosure that every embassy in the world has a \\"trade attach&eacute;\\" which is just another word for a functioning covert operative (spy).  The reader is also privy to the machinations behind banking operation that deals in a most unusual form of \\"currency\\".<br /><br />The first half of the book moves along pretty slowly as Child slowly unveils all the players in this game and lays out the intricate details and it is not until the second half of the book that all the marbles begin to fall into place.  This offering is more atmospheric as not as addictive or adrenaline fueled as some of the other Reacher adventures,  and while it will not take a place among my favorites in this series, it is nonetheless a pretty good read.

B00B2QG3K2|3.0|Like many, I had been looking forward to this album for years, and like many, I was concerned when I heard that the Farro Bros. left the band.  I was afraid the band would cease being Paramore and instead become The Hayley Williams Experience.  So were those fears warranted?  Sort of.<br /><br />I've listened Paramore (the album) probably 15-20 times now.  My first impression was that it was an eclectic collection of songs cobbled together non-cohesively.  Brand New Eyes, All We Know Is Falling, and, to a lesser extent, Riot, all seem to be relatively cohesive and have a generally consistent, poppy alternative rock style.  This album is largely a break from that formula.  Some songs sound a bit like they would fit in well on one of their older albums, but the bigger story is how many songs do not.  The album almost seems experimental at times, like Hayley is taking the opportunity in the absence of her former bandmates to branch out and see what she can do.  In general, most of the songs are more poppy than previous Paramore works, although some songs seem even heavier and deeper than you might expect (Track 17, \\"Future\\", comes to mind).<br /><br />So does it work?  For some people it may.  Ask yourself this -- when you buy a CD, do you typically pick a few tracks you like, listen to those, then pretty much ignore the rest of the disc?  If so, you will probably find a few tracks you like here.  If you're more likely to put in a CD, start it on track 1, and listen to it until it hits the end and your player spins down, you might be a little more frustrated by the constantly changing styles you will find here.  Personally, I fit in the latter group, so I was a little disappointed coming off of Brand New Eyes.  That's not to say there aren't some very good songs on this album -- there definitely are, and any true Paramore fan would be missing out by skipping it.  Still, it doesn't feel like it is on the same level as some of their previous works.<br /><br />Overall, this album isn't just a step in a new direction for Paramore, its a step in a lot of new directions.  I'm very interested to see where they go next -- do they return to their roots, continue to experiment, or do something different altogether?  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're reading this Hayley, I still love you :-)

034547581X|4.0|The formatting for my Kindle was off which annoyed at times. This is an older book, and someone didn't do their job in setting it up for the ereaders.<br /><br />Still, this was a gripping account of several crucial days at an early point in the Vietnam War. One of the authors was a commander in the field and the other a reporter who talked his way into the battle zone. They interviewed many of the soldiers as well as enemy officers in an attempt to write a clear account of what happened. They paint the terror, the courage, and the grief of the men in vivid colors. And they do not shy away from the ineptitude of some officers, many of them above the fray, nor the anger with the med evac helicopters that wouldn't land in hot zones to remove wounded and dead.<br /><br />A terrible story of a terrible time.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys true war reminiscences will enjoy this.
B000IKNZMM|5.0|This story is very intriging and will keep you on the edge of your seat many times! Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott were wonderful actors in this movie. The ending is frightening!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is an introduction into a post-apocalyptic world where people's existence are contained within a huge silo where the society has been carefully constructed to achieve a goal. What that goal is and what it's intended to accomplish and the justification behind those thoughts are among some of the more interesting things to think about when reading through this story.<br /><br />While it's technically a \\"Sci-Fi\\" novel(s), it's really just a well told story about human nature and anthropology that happens to be using a Sci-Fi backdrop to set the events in motion. The first couple books are very short and introduce some members of the older generation of leadership for the silo and what happens to them. The last three books are each much larger and detail what occurs once the events from the first two books set everything in motion.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of mystery and some clever reveals throughout so I hesitate to go too much deeper into the story itself, but I found the book to be very compelling for the most part that had me turning the pages pretty quickly most of the time. The only part that really got a bit bogged down for me came in the last book with Juliette's character sort of stuck doing the same basic activity for a good chunk of book 5 while we're waiting for the other story line to progress where Juliette's could then continue.<br /><br />Beyond that, I quite enjoyed the book(s) and while it did have an ending that satisfactorily (though tragically for some) wrapped up the threads of the stories nicely, I could also see where it serves as an introduction into a larger universe where more stories could easily take place. All in all a story I enjoyed and would definitely recommend to anyone, not just a fan of Sci-Fi.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|I love futuristic movies and this did not disappoint! Showing the passage of time with different military conflicts Kurt fought in was very interesting. How the babies were initially \\"selected\\" for soldiers and then brutally trained thru their childhood was scary! A very good story and worth watching.
B005LAII8K|1.0|By sympathetic characters played by likeable actors for reasons which the movie attempts to justify.  Echoes of \\"Terminator\\" killing everyone named Sarah Conner and a child destined to change the world are everywhere.  There are also echoes of Drew Barrymore in \\"Firestarter\\" but this kid is even younger and he causes an adult's head to explode who could have been outrun.  The plot does cartwheels to brutalize the innocent as much as possible.
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|I love these futuristic stories! Some of the &#34;gadgets&#34; and inventions just crack me up in this movie, including the little &#34;spiders&#34; that can go through an apt building and perform retinal scans on every occupant for the police. Also the advertisements that talk to YOU -again, using some cool kind of retinal/eye technology! The idea of preventing crimes BEFORE they happen utilizing three people with &#34; Pre-Cognitive&#34; abilities is fascinating, not to mention how the criminals are incarcerated!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Started watching the show about halfway through the 3rd season, and got hooked! Just had to watch the previous seasons so I could catch up! Just before the 3rd season's finale, AMC did a Zombie Apocolyspe from season 1 but I was still missing alot. Ordered and received the product one day ahead of schedule, just in time for the weekend! The DVD plays excellent, and LOVE all the extra footage!!! Have ordered the 2nd season, and will definately purchase the 3rd season, as well!!!
B0008ENICU|5.0|I love this movie mainly because of Norma Shearer. The wardrobing is fabulous and the story itself is wonderful. Funny characters and all of them are women (good and bad and the bad are NASTY!)  Very entertaining to see all the female stars in this time period including the booze sippin' woman who ran the Reno ranch for pending divorcees. Hilarious scenes at the style show!  The snappy dialog between all these women never stops!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Picked up interest of the show halfway through season 3, but have quickly caught up! This is an amazing show!! I love the horror genre, and this has been the best of even movies I've seen lately. My husband isn't into the whole horror thing, but even he has gotten into the show! It's not about zombies, it's about the survivors trying to gain/maintain some level of their normal lives. I catch myself getting sooo into the show and occasionally pulling my legs and feet up into my chair, literally biting my nails, and even putting my hands over my eyes (while still peeking though! LOL). I highly reccomend this show to anyone who loves horror/suspense; there sure is enough of it! I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet, but season 3 finale episode....OMG!!! Did NOT see all of THAT coming!!! Totally left me ready for October!!!! Until then, I'll watch/re-watch all 3 seasons on DVD!
B004AKCMD4|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. It is amazing. It is a little violent (for a kids movie) so I would watch it before you let your younger children see it. Which is fine, cause its amazingly entertaining.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I was just trying to get loving points with my girlfriend...She liked the movie and I bought it to see it over Valentine's night
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Good. I am not a huge Mark Whalburg fan, but he does really well in comedies. Better than I expected.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Well worth reading, a real page-turner. The only other Ken Follet book I read before this one was Pillars of the Earth - which is fantastic - and this was equally great.

B000FC2ROU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Kafka on the Shore and it was a great book club selection. The most unique book I've read in a long time!
B0010VDSRK|5.0|And it's not only swing but you get hints of latin beats, the hypnotic Opera voices, something that sounds eerily gothic, and some heavy rock guitar along with many other different combinations that makes this music so diverse and full of intrigue.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Entertaining series but definitely a disappointing ending with no closure. Perhaps the author did this to leave room for the pending tv series but it was still a bit frustrating to finish the series that way.
0765365278|5.0|First of all this is a unique world, you will not see a similar one anywhere.<br />Not once have I read a section and told myself oh yea he ripped this off from...<br /><br />I really did not think I was going to like this book, I got it whn Borders went out of buisness for a couple bucks.<br />Best few dollars I have spent in a long time.<br />The book is massive, the world is mysterious and engaging, the characters are deep and come from all types.<br /><br />This is not a perfect book, but it is a book worth getting.<br /><br />Be forwarned that this is an intended 10 book series, and it will probably run 12,000 - 14,000 pages over the next 8 years.

B006XBSAP2|5.0|Katy Perry's Teenage Dream has to be one of her best albums.  I find that all her hit singles are catchy: from Teenage Dream or Last Friday Night, they are very catchy tunes with catchy lyrics.  This CD also include remixes of songs such as ET which is nice.  If you like Katy Perry and still have not picked up one of her Teenage Dream CD, get this one - it feels complete and I like the extra mixes.
B007N85POS|5.0|Nothing to complain about. If you know Angry Birds, you know Rio. It's a cute game for my Kindle and I like it just fine.
B002EHRBCW|2.0|This album had great potential, produced by Madness' Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, and mostly co-written with Fairground Attraction's Mark Nevin, who should have inspired Morrissey's rockabilly leanings.  The result, however, is a hodge-podge mess.  Some songs strive for a more experimental bent a la Tom Waits or Nick Cave, but generally fall flat.  Others are more promising, tapping into Nevin's strength of penning light-hearted jaunty melodies.  The final stretch, though, is three middle-paced tunes all in 6/8 time.  On their own, each one is fine, but as a set, they seem to drag on forever.  The closing piano ballad, There is a Place in Hell, is epic in its simplicity, and yet the listener is too worn out by this point to care. Oh, and did I mention that the production is muffled and dull throughout?<br /><br />In the recent 2013 reissue, Morrissey has applied his revisionist approach to yet another album, with little success. The revised track listing reflects some understanding of the album's weaknesses. Originally the second track, Asian Rut sapped the energy built by Our Frank of any momentum. Here it's bumped into the middle of the set. Likewise, the four slower tracks at the end are now broken up. There is a Place is replaced with a more upbeat guitar-led version from KROQ, and End of the Family Line is shifted to the closing spot. With its false ending, it is effective as the last word.<br /><br />That said, the new track listing still doesn't work. The shift from Our Frank's pop-rock to Sing Your Life's quirky rockabilly is too abrupt. In the middle, too, we're given two added b-sides, neither of which contribute to a unified sonic vision. Pashernate Love, taken from 1992's You're the One for Me, Fatty, sounds like what it is, an outtake from the more aggressive Your Arsenal. Its lyrical theme of rejecting love fits the album, but the music is from a different era (and producer). Likewise, the Herman's Hermits cover East West is taken from 1989, and sounds like the glossy pop of its day. As a reflection on celebrity, its theme fits alongside Sing Your Life, but the sound again is from another place in Morrissey's career. Elsewhere, the alternate version of There is a Place adds an upbeat spark, but ignores the fact that the original version is the better of the two.<br /><br />Why, then, didn't Morrissey turn to Kill Uncle's own b-sides and contemporary single releases to give a more balanced approach to the album? The Loop and Pregnant for the Last Time would have added to the rockabilly sound and would have been well-complemented by the acoustic Skin Storm or That's Entertainment. My Love Life is the jangliest thing Morrissey has released apart from Marr, and could have been the standout single. Swapping these in for Langer's tunes and the more avant-garde tracks would have given a far more unified sound. Of course, he's also left I've Changed My Plea to Guilty on the cutting floor as well, perhaps Morrissey's most powerful torch song ever. My recommendation for a re-imagining of Kill Uncle would be: A - Our Frank/My Love Life/Sing Your Life/Skin Storm/The Loop/I've Changed My Plea to Guilty B - Pregnant for the Last Time/King Leer/Driving Your Girlfriend Home/Mute Witness/There is a Place.../(I'm) The End of the Family Line. This track listing emphasizes the best of the Morrissey-Levin collaboration, and deserves at least a 4/5 if not a full 5/5.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, no re-tracking can really save Kill Uncle and it is better accepted for what it is: a flawed, transitional album that simply didn't work. It would have been better as a deluxe release with the original album followed by the singles and b-sides of the day as bonus tracks, all of which would fit on one disc!<br /><br />Thankfully, Morrissey redeemed himself on the follow-up Your Arsenal. Producer Mick Ronson got the production right, perfectly balancing aggressive guitars with rockabilly influences, and allowing the right space for a couple of glorious torch songs. Ironically, where Langer and Winstanley couldn't find room for I've Changed my Plea, Ronson turned a similar Levin leftover, I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday, into an absolute showstopper on Your Arsenal.<br /><br />2/5 - For a longer more detailed review, visit my blog: raisemyglasstothebsidee album, but the music is from a different era (and producer).

As a vocalist and lyricist, Morrissey depends on co-writers and producers to realize his vision, and he's had some marvelous collaborations across his career. This includes great singles produced by Langer and Winstanley, and some memorable tunes written by Nevin. When the four came together it simply didn't work. I can't imagine the pressure on a green songwriter like Nevin (Fairground Attraction had just released their second album in 1990) being asked to work with the vaunted Morrissey! His tunes are ambitious, but often awkward. As producers, Langer and Winstanley should have reined in the experimentation and helped this new songwriting duo find their esssence. Unfortunately, L&W seem most comfortable replicating the pop sounds Moz created with Street, and simply weren't up to the task of helping Morrissey find his new sound.<br /><br />For Morrissey fans, Kill Uncle remains interesting, but any hopes of resurrecting the album that could have been are futile. It is what it is and always shall be... a failed experiment.<br /><br />2/5 - For this and more ridiculously long reviews, visit my blog: raisemyglasstothebside

B003EVWDR0|4.0|The creators of Avatar created an entirely new world for viewers to visit and enjoy. It was obvious no expense was spared (except one, but I'll get to that) in the making of this movie, as some of the scenes are simply breathtaking.<br /><br />Here's the gist of the movie: A group of greedy humans are trying to take over a planet because it houses an extremely rare, and in turn valuable, material that will make them rich. The natives of planet Panem are not too keen on having someone visit their island and steal their precious materials while destroying their way of life in the process. One approach to settle the feud between humans and natives is to send in people who control Avatars, devices built to look like the native population. Think if Jane Goodall decided to live with the apes by living inside of a mechanical ape. Somewhat the same idea, only these are controlled remotely from a device that resembles a tanning bed.<br /><br />Most of the people who control these Avatars are scientists, interested in studying the natives and learning their ways. This is sometimes counter to the more militaristic approach of the mercenaries who plan to take the materials by any means necessary. It's your basic good versus evil battle, mixed in with a \\"what side are you on\\" for those controlling the avatars. Keep in mind the natives have done nothing to provoke having their land attacked. They are simply defending themselves from the outsiders who are trying to take over by force.<br /><br />My one major complaint with the movie involves the scenes with avatar and human interaction. It seemed so much time was spent on making everything so majestic, but a lot of these scenes looked extremely fake. I kept thinking back to the movie \\"page master\\" which tried to tie in animation with real life. It was a cool thing to attempt, but it only worked to a certain level. This is how I felt watching some of the Avatar scenes. Maybe they needed to do more work when the avatars, natives, and/or humans were together on screen. Maybe the technology is not yet far enough advanced to handle this. Still, this aspect of the movie was quite a disappointment.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the story line, graphics, and characters of this movie. I would possibly watch it a second time for the visuals and soundtrack, but then lose interest after that. It is one of those movies you have to see once to understand what everyone is talking about. Then in 10 or 15 years, play it again and laugh at how bad the effects were but remember with fondness how great they seemed at the time.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Take away the good looking cast and the fun plot line of ABC's megahit Nashville and you reveal its two most important characters; the city the music. The chart topping soundtrack is laden with love, loss, scandal and heartbreak. As expected, the sound is mostly contemporary country. Veteran producer T Bone Burnett attributes the album's quality to \\"a wealth of incredible material laying around [Nashville]\\"<br /><br />The material is tailored to the personae of the characters. Ing&eacute;nue Juliette Barnes (played by Hayden Panettierre) is assigned all the straightforward pop.  Not surprisingly, it includes several revenge anthems that feel like they were ripped right out of Taylor Swift's diary. Veteran country star Rayna James (Connie Britton) takes the reins on ballads dealing with divorce, regret and all issues that aging brings with it. The themes may be a bit worn, but the fresh melodies are infectious. From the bubble gum pop of  Love Like Mine to the power rocking man diss  Wrong Song, he record is a cohesive, pleasing listen for its 40 minutes.<br /><br />Thankfully, there are a few rough touches on the generally glossy material.  There is some angry punk on Twist of Barb Wire and knee slapping bluegrass on Britton's Buried Under. She is one of the only cast members with no public singing experience, but you would never know it. She delivers recording quality performances throughout.<br /><br /> Claire Bowen (Scarlett O'Connor) is a quiet standout. Her voice is the most lilting and sultry and shines on the Civil Wars' cover If I Didn't Know Better.<br /><br />With few exceptions, the material feels like it was written and produced taking dead aim at the chart's summit.  Mission accomplished.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Stanley Kubrick is by far one of the most influential directors of all time. He has directed many timeless classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. This film is great because it gives us a sampling of what life was like in the later stages of the Vietnam War. The acting, though done by unfamiliar actors, is spectacular. I give this movie two thumbs up!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I absolutely love this show. The acting is great. The characters and history involved in the plot is amazing. It is just such a great show that everyone should watch.

B005PZ85SO|1.0|I had seen the prelude to this episode on TV and just couldn't wait to see how it turned out.  When I played this on my computer, the audio and video were out of sync. Also the video kept stopping or pausing.  I didn't pay that much to see this and that was the only good thing.
0316017930|5.0|The book was a pretty nice read, nice to be able to see that nobody can do it alone. It was received within the slotted time with the shipping, not much more I could ask for
B009ICQ6KO|4.0|I heard some of this CD on the radio and liked them, so I bought it.  I was hoping that Charlie would get to sing lead on some of the tunes, but except for some BGVs on one track , he's strictly here for the harp playing, which, by the way is very, very good here.  Very authentic blues playing all the way around, but with Harper's distinctive lyrical style, which is a nice break from the traditional 'wrong-doin woman' songs.
B004XISI4A|4.0|The book is very long and even as an ardent and enthusiastic reader, it got a bit much for me at times with many characters and plots. The fact that he is constantly killing off characters makes it hard to get invested and is always involving more plots and more people makes it a loooot of information to try to keep in mind at any one time. I found the X-Ray function on my Kindle invaluable in this regard, as it will quickly help you remember who is who. Another frustrating thing is that he sometimes uses pseudonyms which adds to the general complexity and chaos of the book. The series is excellent, shockingly real and brutal and I would recommend it. But come prepared for a lot of information and for the fact that you will almost certainly lose track of what is happening and be left unsatisfied with cliffhangers at regular intervals.

B004DNWPY4|4.0|Book illuminates exactly who the millionaires are in America with interesting empirical data to support it. The surprise: they are not who we think they are. They're not hyper-spenders; they don't drive foreign luxury cars; they don't live in upscale neighborhoods and own expensive houses. Because of this, they are wealthy. Not because of realized income, but because of their total net worth. Forget about becoming a millionaire - become wealthy.

B0062KJ198|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because it is that funny. The cast members have dynamic chemistry which makes the script come to life.  The theme is dark which Is true for a lot comedy, and I couldn't stop giggling through a series of traumatic events. I am a big fan of Danny Mc Bride and now the rest of the cast as well. I have been sick and watching this movie distracted me from all discomfort! The preview didn't do it justice. I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh.
B000YAG00A|4.0|Classic Kubrick film that captured the dehumanization of marine boot camp.  Although most people may agree that the ordeals dealt with during boot camp were accurate, the movie should have ended there.
B008220BP2|3.0|\\"What's wrong with me? I just want to connect, why can't I connect with people? Oh, right...it's because I'm dead.\\" R (Hoult) is a zombie, a very depressed zombie looking for meaning in his life. After him and a group out looking for food find a pack of young adults they begin to feast. When R eats someone he sees his memories, then changes his mind and saves his girlfriend Julie (Palmer). The two begin a relationship that may change the world forever. This is a very funny movie that just seemed to run out of steam a little over halfway through. The movie is very much worth watching and actually turns out very sweet, if not a little too perfect. The only real problem is that after awhile I started to lose interest a little and seemed to really drag toward the end. I still recommend this movie but it's not as good as Zombieland or Shaun Of The Dead. Overall, very funny movie but just couldn't maintain the beginning excitement the entire way. I give it a B.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This one is a keeper that I like to reread often. It has many memorable moments and the world that the author has built is unique and refreshing. I have some qualms about the short length of time that the H & H meet and fall in love but with fantasy romance, you just have to suspend belief for a while and you'll be able to fully enjoy it. This is a great start to the Elder Race series and I've read all the books that have followed and enjoyed them just as much.

B000VZIOCK|5.0|This is one of those rare CDs that you just push play on, because every song is great.  A truly cool aspect of this CD is how divesified it is; no two songs are even remotely the same.  The album features some amazing time signatures and there are so many great songs such as No One Knows and Hanging Tree that highlight this masterpiece.<br /><br />Easily one of the best hard rock albums ever made.  Definately the best hard rock album of the decade.
B006HAJ99K|5.0|I've always loved Henry James. However, I read Wings of the Dove long ago, so I can't really say how faithful this film is to the book. But it doesn't matter. This film is magnificent. Every element contributes to the whole, as another reviewer has said. The usual Jamesian complex mixture of motivations is present in each character, in varying degrees. Wonderful! I highly recommend this film!

B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I wish Cheryl Strayed wrote it in time for me to read as a 20-something. Better late than never. I will not engage in a lengthy review. Others have done a wonderful job of this. I will say that this book moved me not only because of the boldness that Cheryl displayed by hiking the PCT, but by the transparency she achieves in the telling. I feel invited to own aspects of my past that I might have previously chosen to hide. Thanks, Cheryl Strayed.

B005LAIH2W|2.0|Oh, my God, all these four and five star reviews are written by family members of Disney, right? No wonder this film bombed. Juvenile from beginning to end, and Carter's jumping \\"flying\\" scenes right out of all those Asian Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon flicks where people sailed through the air on \\"erased\\" ropes and tethers. So why did I watch the whole movie after I knew it was a total loser in the first ten minutes? I'm a sucker for superb special effects and no one can take that away from the makers of this silly, near indecipherable waste of good talent. In my rarely humble opinion, the whole cast was miscast. Nothing personal, the people are good actors, just too pretty, too young, too whatever. The movie lacks dirt, dust, grime, and grit, if that makes any sense. The whole thing is too clean, too shiny, the CGI too perfect. It's the difference, I suspect, between this Disney/Pixar epic, and Industrial Light & Magic who do the more sophisticated CGI films. Why STAR WARS (ILM) at its worst, was never boring, slow, or lacking the \\"wow\\" factor. Whereas John Carter strives for Lord Of The Rings quality but falls flat on all accounts. I know it's really being picky to say so, but even young kids know that neither of the two moons of Mars are spherical. And in every night scene here, there they are, always in the same place, spaced the same distance apart, no drama, no sense that we're really on another planet. Okay, one big positive to end with. I did like the ending. Strangely enough. The final plot twist was clever, but comes way too late (like at the very end of the movie)is way too little, and can't even begin to save this film from the \\"coulda been great\\" junk pile. Even with the outstanding special effects, I can't recommend this antiseptic, almost sterile presentation.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|As a child of the 80s this book was wonderful. Cleverly written,<br />fun, and imaginative. This book was my OASIS for the past two days.
B007FXLWKW|5.0|James Marsden is always great to watch and teamed with a fantasy character who is formed by Russell Brand is just a wonderful relaxing and enjoyable movie.  I watch it whenever it is on cable and now have my own dvd for when I just need to see something lighthearted. Everyone needs those movies where you can just sit and leave stress or worry of the day behind and this, I find, is that kind of movie.  It is like Pete's Dragon or Mary Poppins.  I truly believe it will be a holiday classic.
B00B4804KS|3.0|Saw this movie in 3d at the theater. The 3d is not good at all. This a great movie but the 3d was done very and i mean very poorly. Get the bluray trilogy for 39.99 instead of wasting 34 dollars on the piss poor 3d version.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Cute pictures with lots of color.  Basically no instructions; just watch 2 little ponies run around on their own own.
0810989956|5.0|Purchased for my 8 year old child who does not &#34;love&#34; to read.  This book is very interactive and makes him not only ready but write and also laugh.  We enjoy going over the questions and his answers together and every night he now wants to go read and work in the book before bed instead of playing video games.  Great purchase!!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I read this book at my sons suggestion not really knowing what I was getting into but I must admit it's one of the best books I’ve read lately. Patrick Rothfuss imagination is captivating to say the least. I loved and enjoyed the way he describes every detail, places, people, smells, colors and specially the feelings of Kvothe the main character. He makes you walk into the story with him like a really good story teller and enjoy, hate, fear, love his family, the places, friends and enemies. In a world that could easily be part of our past, present or future in this universe or the one next to ours, who knows but Kvothe is waiting for you. I’ve just finished book One, I am hoping books two and three are even better.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Wes Anderson.  With amazing cast and soundtrack, this a movie about young love and adolescence. Hilarious and witty as always, Anderson has done it again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fun to play subway surfers and try to beat your friends on Facebook,but it can be addicting too.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My 6-year-old has never laughed so hard for any other movie.  It's a great rental or purchase.  Even I enjoyed it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I LIKE ALL JACK REACHER NOVELS<br />JACK REACHER AND LEE CHILD RULES<br />WHAT ESLE CAN I SAY, I ;VE READ EVERY ONE
B00BWJARHO|4.0|So I understand why a lot of people don't like the movie.  It is LONG, and does feel a bit inconsistent.  Unfortunately, those people don't understand the books.<br /><br />The movie The Hobbit should instead be named &#34;Everything else in Middle Earth that didn't concern Frodo&#34;, which is totally fine by me, as I've been dying for a decent interpretation of the appendices materials.  Also, covering this much information does take a lot of time, so you should take an intermission once the party is about to depart from Rivendell.<br /><br />I think what bothers a lot of people in this movie is the disjointedness between laughing dwarves singing merrily and doing dishes at one moment and then messily beheading goblins the next minute.  This is how the books were actually written.  J. R. R. Tolkien, Cambridge linguistics professor, genius, and brilliant author overall, just can NOT write a children's book.  Peter Jackson stays true to the spirit of Tolkien's writing, although that may be somewhat to the movie's detriment.<br /><br />All that being said, I'm still going to buy it once the extended edition comes out. :)
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I saw it on a friend of mine's kindle,  I Loved it but I could not get it.  ??????  Why?
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|So far I like it.  I need to learn how to customize features.  Let me know as the software develops..
B009OYSFDM|5.0|a pretty decent version of green arrow ..i am a green arrow fan and while they take some liberties with some of the origin story..like where it is going. i like the modern up dating as well .  i am eagerly awaiting the character development for the next season 8)
B00005V9IJ|1.0|I ordered widescreen edition and it even stated it was widescreen on the back of the DVD cover.  However, it wasn't widescreen.  I love this movie and feel that there's so many views of the ocean and land that you really do need a wider view of everything.  Very disappointed that the disc was not the one that should have been in the DVD case.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Difficult because  of the graphic description of orphanage horror & knowing it was an accurate depiction was  sobering.Great character development and descriptive details. Learned some wonderfully idiomatic words well. Definitely recommend.
B004EBT7RI|4.0|Such a great book, I can almost smell the cooking being done in the kitchen. See the colours of their surroundings. Still a few more chapters to read, and I'm enjoying it very much.
B00AEFXI8W|5.0|the first time i ever saw this film i was only 12, yes 12 years old. for some reason i found myself completely drawn into the story line, characters, and everything to do with this film. almost 25 years later finally i decide to buy it and surprisingly it's available on Blu-ray. the video transfer looks absolutely incredible, especially the wide aerial shots of Japan. audio is standard English 5.1 Dolby Digital Ex & 6.1 DTS-ES, the latter sounding the best for obvious reasons. if you're a fan of the film and considering purchasing the Blu-ray version you won't be disappointed.
B0061S073A|1.0|The people who made this game are jerks!!! When I tried it, I found out what it does is it just loos you out of EVERYTHING! ITS A REALLY BAD APP THAT JUST WASTES SPACE ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE!
B001FB55L2|1.0|Too unbelievable to be enjoyed. A few good action scenes but so poorly written I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The way the mystery began was very interesting. It had me hooked from the beginning. I would recommend that game be played. It's looking for the items.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I do like playing this game very much.  It does lock up occasionaly but I just usually back out and restart the game.  I wish the<br />full version games would have been harder.  It seems like the free version is a bit tougher.  I have a copy on my Ipod Touch and<br />Kindle.<br />I can't complain when it costs $.99.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|for some reason the drivers that came with the interface are bad. i believe it comes with ver 2.1 but you can easily download 2.4 from their website for free. hardware wise it's pretty awesome and worth it.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|Looks pretty good I always prefer the minimalist subtle designs, I don't need LEDS or a window in the side of my case.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter  loves  this game. she is three, it keeps us entertained  for hours. She loves to take care of her horse
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This is an excellent book so far. I am only 20% into but I can tell it is worth the read.  If you like Michener, then you are sure to like this series.  It is fiction but full of history.  I intend to read the next two books in this series.
B006O6F932|4.0|The only 2 things I disliked was the lack of portability and the very TINY accessories that come with this playset. The playset does close up but its not simple to do so. There are a few hooks and latches and things you must take off first which can be easily lost. The tiniest pieces of this set are the locker locks. I wouldnt suggest this set for someone who has other younger children in the household under 3 yrs old. The playset is visually appealing and she enjoyed it very much. It's just very easy to lose those accessories. I'd say the set is worth looking into for kids over 8 yrs old.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awsome. I absolutely am addicted to it. There is no game that is better then my horse
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. It is fairly reliable, at least for 2-3 days out. I wish it didn't run in the background constantly. However, it doesn't appear to use too much battery or memory.
B006LSZECO|1.0|SO disappointed. Is this the type of dribble that makes it to top 10 book lists? I kept hoping for more than the plastic barby  and ken dolls that I was given. Even in the last Chapter I was hoping for more than the predictable-but I was wrong. Don't waste your time.
B008602KQI|4.0|Overall, a good movie. Some action, some heartstring tugging and in the end, the good guys win. Not an Oscar winner, but an entertaining movie.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|A low budget movie...  but you won't notice that, the effects (while without a WOW factor) are adequate and realistic, serving its purpose perfectly...  but this is a story/character driven movie. I love the original Star Wars trilogy and Star Trek, but I also love Sci-Fi movies like Red Planet and Sunshine...  Science Fiction that makes you think, is contemplative...  Moon is one such, and I highly enjoyed it. Still love to see it upon second and third viewings as I show it to friends. A good movie to pick up.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is an awesome game for all family. Very simple rules, but makes players think strategically. It teachs kids to think! Good entertainment for kids from 5 years old to adults.
B00846REIS|5.0|Eva and Gideon will become part of you! I just couldn't get enough of them! I can't wait to read more!!
B000HKYBXA|5.0|I originally ran into this movie in class, when we were studying hamlet.  Not exactly the most glorifying of introductions.  We actually watched several different versions of the movie, in an effort to make the text more 'real' or something.<br /><br />Had I not just studied the text, the language might have thrown me off a bit, but I don't think so.  This movie was a brilliant production that was enjoyable in it's own right.  This is a must have not because Hamlet is 'high culture' and this is the best production of it ever.  This is a must have because it's an enjoyable masterpiece in it's own right.  Shakespeare is remembered because he was an incredible playwright, and Hamlet was his greatest masterpiece.  This movie does his art justice.  I cannot overstate how highly I think of this movie.
B0064QNS62|1.0|Just re-downloaded this game for a second chance.  It didn't help!  Some may like the clunky  controls and retro look, but it was not for me.  Give it a try, but do so when you aren't stressed!  Lol!
B0028T6XXY|5.0|Great show/documentary. Fun and entertaining. Michael is great on cd and live is even better! Loved it! He's so funny and talented, it's incredible!
B0060MYM7O|4.0|My only complaint is that the opening sequence plays before every episode. Of course as with any adaptation they simply can't tell as much of the story as the book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Its great for taking notes. I can take notes on my tablet and have hem available on my laptop. It makes my life easier.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This product arrived promptly and in good condition and the cd played without a flaw---we enjoyed a really great movie besides!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I got this book free and jumped at the chance to have it as an e-book. Have loved this series since the beginning when my niece got me a signed copy of Wizard's First Rule.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Not sure that it was worth all they hype but entertaining none the less.  Will read another by the author.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Overall this is a great movie.  I'm not sure how much is true and how much is fiction, but overall it's a great movie showing the downfall of one of the world's biggest bad guys!
B008J05EL8|4.0|If anyone wants to do minor word processing in the Microsoft Word format on your Kindle I would recommend this application. The only thing that keeps it from being a truly great app is it does not allow you to have white text on a black background (night mode). For the price it is wonderful.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I luved it was awesome best book I have ever read!!!!!!  This book really is great and is a wonder.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was great I can't wait to read the final book. The suspense is killing me. Catching fire is a great read.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I love the book but this movie was unwatchable.  The acting is campy, especially the actor who plays Count Vronsky.  And the theater/stage motif is gimmicky and annoying.  Every few minutes a handful of random extras push some props onto the set.  I pulled the plug after about 30 minutes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book catches your attention right away. The characters are interesting and the story is intriguing. Then halfway through...BAM!! What a twist! I have read this book 3 times and haven't been able to put it down.
B005HEFB6M|3.0|The first season was good but the temporal wars was bad storyline in the series.  The final season was the best especially the Mirror episodes.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|THE PRESENTATION WAS FLAWED. APARENTLY, AMAZON DOES NOT HAVE THEIR STREAMING TECHNOLOGY PERFECTED AND DO EVEN WORSE ON CUSTOMER SERVICE.<br />RENTED THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON AND PART WAY THRU IT  JUST STOPPED. WE RESET IT AND IT PLAYED THRU JUST FINE. BUT HERE IS THE HITCH AMAZON CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD TWO TIMES.<br />MIKE
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter and me enjoy this game a lot. First, it is colorful, but not busy looking. I personally love the glowing colors when you draw the line. Second, it is easy to understand how to play and no need to erase the lines you do not want.Last, it is a good game to train your brain. We can play it off line also, and no crash so far.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|The book from beginning to end was great! I would recommend this book to any of you fantasy readers to have a try.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|There's nothing I can add to the other stellar reviews for this set. It is an excellent compilation covering Allman's career. Even the rarer stuff is very good unlike many compilations/retrospectives where the creators dredge up any racket put on tape and pass it off as something of value. It's good all the way through!<br /><br />A couple of things I recommend:<br /><br />1) Put the discs in paper sleeves like those used for CD/DVD-Rs and save the original sleeves in the box for reference. The ones in the set are unbelievably cheap and flimsy. I have never seen such thin paper used for sleeves like these, especially in such a pricey set. Even free discs and driver software for peripherals come in sleeves that are far stronger than these. There are no double seams or folded edges so they split very easily.<br /><br />2) If you tend to save the goodies that come in sets like this, put the 'SkyDog' sticker between some plastic and in an envelope. It doesn't have the best adhesive and will shift against its backing exposing the glue and stick to the booklet, the box, or whatever it touches. The potential to damage the booklet or simply ruin the sticker is great enough this is worth doing.<br /><br />3) There's a guitar pick as well that is easy to miss depending on where it ends up in the box. I found mine on the floor. Make sure you secure it somehow.<br /><br />I know this sadly because I found the sleeve for disc one split half-way along one side the second time I removed the disc. Inspecting the others, half have already have begun splitting on the edges and bottom. (NOT the seller's fault in packing the set for shipping) I can't emphasize enough how cheap they are!<br /><br />I also had to use a hair drier to get the sticker off the booklet and fortunately was able to get it back onto the backing without distorting or damaging it. It appeared the glue had oozed out between the sticker and the thin piece of the sticker around the edges.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books over the years about spirituality, death, dying, and Heaven. This book was very good and gave information I had never heard or read before.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I brought this flashlight as a present for my dad. We are both surprised by how bright this thing is! Excellent build quality. Now, i am thinking of getting one for myself.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|You get to have pet dragons they give you money and there are rare dragons like rainbow Dragon and the sun dragon and the moon dragon it looks very boring but it's really  really really fun
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this series! Got rid of our satellite tv and thought I would go nuts not being able to watch my Walking Dead episodes! Thank God that Amazon has them for purchase. Now I can watch them when ever I want!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Have a lot going on in my life right now.  This was a nice way to relax and have fun.  The game kept my adrenaline pumping.  I hope others will try it and have as much fun as I did.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|This movie is a great kids movie that will also entertain adults also. I really didn't want to watch it, but the kids talked me into it and I found the movie to be very funny.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|THIS IS SO FUN I LOVE THIS GAME !!! I HEARD ABOUT THIS GAME SO I WENT AND GOT IT MY FRIENDS ARE ALL WAYS PLAYING IT SO I GOT IT NOW I SEE WHY THEY WERE ITS SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A Must read! our book club loved the book as well, we had a great discussion.  I may read it again!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a heart warming story that all ages will love. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did
B008KYOCA2|4.0|once figured out how to delete the event they had given, went much easier. Have to have it on alerts to hear reminders on kindle. great for free app.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I admire Ms. Sandberg tremendously for the courage it took to write this book. Her message is long over due and she delivers it in such a positive manner. She talks about the difficult line women in business have to walk and offers practical career advice. What I especially liked though is her message that moving forward is in the hands of the younger generations. Yes! We have come far from the days of our great grand mothers who didn't have the vote, but we are sliding backwards. If the current younger generations do not Step Up, we will continue to lose more ground. So many women before me and so many women of my generation have fought hard-won battles. We do not want to lose that ground because younger women don't believe it is relevant to them. Check it out. Department of Labor statistics show we are still earning 77 cents on the dollar for the same work. We need more women to display the courage of Sheryl Sandberg!
B00884GR0W|5.0|This blew me away(not literally). The gameplay is astonishing for how you actually have quests to do. More like side quests but at least it gives you some objective to do other than the ones you set for yourself. Also, generally better graphics than Minecraft, and more customizeable graphics settings.
B00AB55BS0|1.0|These disks when they work are great.  However after testing with two near new updated players, these disks either will not load or take nearly five minutes to load.  At times load is rejected with a copyright incompatibility message.  Video quality is excellent and sound is good although not excellent.  I have had to repeatedly reboot players by unplugging them to finally get them to play.  I am returning them until I hear that.  Buyer beware.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I waited a looooooong time to read this book. Because of the negative reviews about how people didn't understand what Abby saw in a fighting &#34;punk&#34;.. To be honest the characters didn't bother me .. As always I cannot stand angst and indecision of the heroine.. That is one of my pet peeves.. Along with the H/h cheating in my romance books.. I enjoyed the characters, the story and the ending.. But the book is not my cup of tea because of the whiplash I got from the heroine.. Don't be afraid though read it..
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a lot of fun, I just don't like how they try to get you to pay real money, but if you're patient, you can advance bust the same.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This is very enjoyable and since I like the show I throughly enjoy seeing these old ones.  They are so funny.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a fun game where you can be the shark and eat everything it a fun version of JAWS.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great movie not just for comic book fans, but for anyone who enjoys a good story and some action. Safe for the kids as well as it isn't over the top with gore. The Avengers is the culmination of Marvel's Phase One development of movies. You do have to suspend some belief and immerse yourself in the comicbook/movie realm to fully enjoy.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|AMAZING ALBUM! from a fan since when they first started, in 2004!! very different from their previous albums but still amazing!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this book. Not usually a genra I like, but this book combines mystery, adventure, compassion, and courage into a fantastic futuristic tale.  Great story!  I had a difficult time putting it down and can't wait to get my hands on the next one.  Please Hugh Howey, don't make me wait to long.
B0050C863G|5.0|I feel much more peaceful and cheerful since learning the techniques and practicing them daily.  I think if everyone tried these techniques, we would have a more peaceful world!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It opens up a new world with characters that you will recognize and enjoy.  Some of the background history of the hero is difficult to read.  Most of us, hopefully, will have trouble relating to his experiences as a young boy.  Throughout the book are moments of great joy and moments of frustration when you want to dust him off and give him a hug.  You will certainly be entertained.  If you are looking for something different, you can't go wrong with The Misremembered Man.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I don't play this but my kids play it every time we go to Starbucks and they love it.  It keeps them happy and occupied so that I can enjoy my coffee!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|The game is really cool and easy to pick up. It gets challenging at times but that's when it's most fun.
B003U51D58|2.0|I was lost the whole time.  I don't know what was supposed to be real and what was not. Confusing
B00000D9TQ|5.0|What a classic list of songs from this hits collection of his.  I recommend it to everyone!<br />Well put together with clarity and stereo sound.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app for my Kindle Fire!  It's so much better than the Weather Chanel app - has hourly information that really helps me plan my day.  When I want weather information this is the first place I turn
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book is a very quick read and full of ideas for each of us to consider.  I doubt you will agree with everything Mark Cuban says, but there has to be some nugget of truth in here for everyone.
B0061S073A|5.0|I tried the free time app on my kindle fire 2 and my kids kept bringing the device back to factory reset. This app is 100% better at keeping my kids in their section of my devices than anything I have ever tried before .  I highly, highly recommend it. When paired with their video player app it is pretty much perfect. My only wish is that it would have a way to set it up with separate accounts / screens for multiple children so I wouldn't have to adjust the apps for each kid..kudos to the developers of this app.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Wonderful, exciting, thought-provoking.  Many discoveries by the main character were big jumps, but on the logical side, nonetheless.  Truly a fun read!
B0068THAGY|2.0|I am glad I did not go see this at the movies.I would have asked for my money back.The commercials were better than the movie.
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|Just a great story overall by Frank Miller. If you liked the movies then read this, you won't be disappointed or even if you have not seen Sin City yet read this first.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app during church!! I think this was a good idea beacause it gets me to red my bible more
B0086DBE62|2.0|I was hoping for more than a handsome prince and pretty princess from this Snow White adaptation. And while the special effects were well done, they didn't make up for the lack of story. Plus, the Bollywood number at the end was ridiculous. (and not in a good way.) I wouldn't recommend this movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a fun game!! I have it on my kindle, phone, and iPad! It need levels though!! Thanks
B003YL4LYI|4.0|It was ok.  Too much stuff going on.  Hard to keep track of everything and everyone...especially with such a big gap from the last book.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I think it is an ok game it just gets boring after awhile. But it is challenging too. Thanks :)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I've always been a grateful American but reading Chris' story really reiterates the fact that we live  in the  greatest country in the  world with the best people. Don't sweat the the little things in life.

B0096HFOZO|4.0|Good book. It is short but very good. Mr. and Mrs. Twit were very mean and ruthless. Overall, good book.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm is great. My old alarm clock broke and this app saved me from having to spend money on a new on. Works just as well, if not better.
0205313426|5.0|How does one account for authoritative advice on writing style? While styles of writing vary according to each writer's own preference some guidelines are inevitable to enhance writing clearer for readers. William Strunk's The Elements of Styles has been loved and considered to be one of authoritative manual for writers on this regard. Now deceased former English professor of Cornell University, Strunk provided writers eleven rules of usage (chapter one) and eleven principles of composition (chapter two) along with few other tips and reminders in the rest of the book. Thus Strunk's central claim for clarity of writing comes from concision and precision. However since it has been more than fifty years it was first published,  should Strunk's assertions considered to be still valid? Has it praised with sacrifice of creativity? Beginning with a brief summary this review will examine several critical issues addressed in the book such as \\"should passive voice indicative verb be avoided at all cost?\\"<br /><br />[Summary]<br />\\"Vigorous writing is concise...., but that every word tell\\" E.B. White who became the coauthor who expanded Strunk's work called this as \\"master[ly] Strunkian elaboration\\" (xv). The authors of Element of Style not only obsessed with words but also pleaded writers not to waste any word. Their calling of writers to concise and precise writing has been appealing for half century. They begin Style from specific rules of guidance to broad and thematic traits for composition. Readers learn about how to use commas for listings, how to write dates and common abbreviations, use of restrictive clauses, when to break clauses--and how to break them--, why one should not use `s  (apostrophe s) when related to Moses and Jesus but use it in other cases even if the word ends in -s.<br />Then in the second chapter the authors toned down a little dealing with principles of English composition. Unlike the first chapter, which originally had seven rules but expanded into eleven, this chapter preserved its original eleven principles from Strunk. He suggested principles that many of them now became a kind of norm for most academic writings: begin a paragraph with a topic sentence; use positive language; use definite, specific, and concrete language if available; avoid a successive loose construction; group conjunctions in similar tone; keep related word together, and also keep the same tense throughout if possible; push your emphasis toward the end of a sentence.<br /><br />In the next three chapters White tried to catch time by supplementing recent and relevant materials to consider for modern writers. Few matters of form (chapter 3) is a culmination of writing tips that can only be found in fragments in various sources. Chapter four \\"Misused Words and Expressions\\" so useful that even Grammar Girl  often makes reference to some of them. What could have been lacking for a clear writing in 1950s has been supplemented by these last three chapters through White's revision, and even critical readers cannot deny their usefulness to find information in one book.<br /><br />[Critical Evaluation]<br />The unseen success of Style motivated many similar works to follow. Probably three more well-known classics followed its success would be John R. Trimble's Writing with Style, William Zinsser's On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction, and Joseph M.

1604680547|4.0|When it says designs for machine quilting, I expected continuous line type designs.  There were only a handful of those in this book. There is a great variety of shapes and styles, but one would have to be very creative in order to adapt them into continuous line designs for machine quilting.
0205191584|5.0|How does one account for authoritative advice on writing style? While styles of writing vary according to each writer's own preference some guidelines are inevitable to enhance writing clearer for readers. William Strunk's The Elements of Styles has been loved and considered to be one of authoritative manual for writers on this regard. Now deceased former English professor of Cornell University, Strunk provided writers eleven rules of usage (chapter one) and eleven principles of composition (chapter two) along with few other tips and reminders in the rest of the book. Thus Strunk's central claim for clarity of writing comes from concision and precision. However since it has been more than fifty years it was first published,  should Strunk's assertions considered to be still valid? Has it praised with sacrifice of creativity? Beginning with a brief summary this review will examine several critical issues addressed in the book such as \\"should passive voice indicative verb be avoided at all cost?\\"<br /><br />[Summary]<br />\\"Vigorous writing is concise...., but that every word tell\\" E.B. White who became the coauthor who expanded Strunk's work called this as \\"master[ly] Strunkian elaboration\\" (xv). The authors of Element of Style not only obsessed with words but also pleaded writers not to waste any word. Their calling of writers to concise and precise writing has been appealing for half century. They begin Style from specific rules of guidance to broad and thematic traits for composition. Readers learn about how to use commas for listings, how to write dates and common abbreviations, use of restrictive clauses, when to break clauses--and how to break them--, why one should not use `s  (apostrophe s) when related to Moses and Jesus but use it in other cases even if the word ends in -s.<br />Then in the second chapter the authors toned down a little dealing with principles of English composition. Unlike the first chapter, which originally had seven rules but expanded into eleven, this chapter preserved its original eleven principles from Strunk. He suggested principles that many of them now became a kind of norm for most academic writings: begin a paragraph with a topic sentence; use positive language; use definite, specific, and concrete language if available; avoid a successive loose construction; group conjunctions in similar tone; keep related word together, and also keep the same tense throughout if possible; push your emphasis toward the end of a sentence.<br /><br />In the next three chapters White tried to catch time by supplementing recent and relevant materials to consider for modern writers. Few matters of form (chapter 3) is a culmination of writing tips that can only be found in fragments in various sources. Chapter four \\"Misused Words and Expressions\\" so useful that even Grammar Girl  often makes reference to some of them. What could have been lacking for a clear writing in 1950s has been supplemented by these last three chapters through White's revision, and even critical readers cannot deny their usefulness to find information in one book.<br /><br />[Critical Evaluation]<br />The unseen success of Style motivated many similar works to follow. Probably three more well-known classics followed its success would be John R. Trimble's Writing with Style, William Zinsser's On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction, and Joseph M. Williams' (or Williams's) Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace.  Tremble began stressing that writing is a simple conversation between author and his reader. He emphasized, unless Strunk, importance of personal characteristic and creative style of the author which readers appreciate more than rigid style.

B000KGY9CE|2.0|Gothic shows the inspirational origins for Frankensein and The Vampyre, but it doesn't do much to tell the stories that were used in that rainy competition.  If the events at Villa Dioadati were strange as they are depicted in the movie, then the movie did a great job.  But if you're hoping to see the creative tales that were told that weekend, you won't see them.
B00A2AU0KI|4.0|Intresting story nicely done.  The interaction between father and daughter was sad but very enlighting as to why things seem one way but really different
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I use this all the time when I am out on the road and need to get something from my computer at the office.  I LOVE it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its fun and easy to use. Very entertaining and gives you different choices making it nicer, more agreeable and friendlier to play.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find how much I liked this series especially since the gender for Watson was swapped.  But definitely worth taking a look at.
034580404X|5.0|I almost did't read this series because the only thing I'd heard about it was the kinky sex. But I found this to be an incredibly moving story about a deeply damaged man who uses sex as a coping mechanism. We follow his journey through the eyes of his girlfriend as she helps him confront his past traumas. The series begins on a very romantic and erotic level, but then becomes more and more psychological. By the end, I was absolutely sobbing when his horrific childhood is revealed. After I finished reading this, I immediately read it again. I plan on reading it a third time, and I've never done that with any book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I knew I would like this book a lot just from the sample, and I was right. I loved how the characters and the scenes were described in such detail, that you felt that you were right there with them. And, of course, it was a book that could make you smile and make you sad depending on where you were in the book. I think Ms. Grissom did a great job and would love to read something else by her.

B004Y1USJE|4.0|This is a good contemporary variation of the Yes sound.  I liked the &#34;Fly From Here&#34; song as recorded live back in 1979, but it is a stretch to make a multipart suite of it.  The other tracks are much better and great sing along material, especially &#34;The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be&#34; and &#34;Hour Of Need&#34; .
1475143389|5.0|This book was very informative in a way that anyone could understand.  I've been weightlifting for about a year now, competed in a strongman event, and am now prepping to enter the NPC as a natural.  I've heard ridiculous extremes of diets, a lot of them without backup explanation/valid science.  I ordered this book for diet purposes and in hopes of understanding the role of all the macros in muscle building and weight loss.  Mike explained everything about nutrition perfectly and then some.  I know a lot about the importance of lifting heavy, but I will definitely be trying out some of his ideas in my training from now on.  The most impressive thing to me though was the fact I got an email from Mike asking if I had any questions.  I've been plateauing for several weeks within my contest prep, so he offered to take a look at my diet and workout schedule.  Talk about passionate!  I haven't heard of any other author offering that type of interest in their buyers. You can tell he wrote this book because he truly wants to help people, so you're not going to find any BS!  Definitely worth the buy.

B004GUSG4M|3.0|It's not the worst but not the best book I have read. I guess took to long to get to the end that part was good. The first few chapters I was pretty much lost.Sorry:-(

B000FCKGPC|5.0|This books are intricately written, giving the reader a heart-wrenching surprise at every turn! (Not suggested for the faint of heart or easily offended)
B000YH6YG8|5.0|Great movie.  Some parts are hard to watch but well worth the message.  I saw the movie years ago but bought it so that I could watch it with my 18 year old son.  He has grown up in a predominately white area and has not seen the ugliness of racism.  We watched Crash last week which led to a good conversation about racism and micro-aggression.  Watching  American History X will be powerful in a different way.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was pleasantly a bit more suspensfull and edgy for N. Sparks. I liked it,can't wait to see the movie.
B000002KAT|5.0|This is the best of the many great albums by Van Morrison.  Every track is deep, layered with many instruments.  Every time I listen to this album I'll hear something new and different.  The lyrics are some of his most abstract and best.  His songs express a range of emotions from the wild joy of Sweet Thing to the burnt out Slim Slow Slider.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app. So glad my friend suggested it. So fun to play with my kids. Can't wait to see what they add!
B000003CMB|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of live albums by jam bands, but this album is far and away the best of the genre.  The Allman Brothers Bands' talent and musicianship shines through making every song a delight.  If you're a fan of bands like Phish or the Grateful Dead, you'll love this album.  Even if you're not this album is well worth listening to.

B007REV4T8|5.0|When Mr. Flemming looks down to check his work, he approves of these new movies and books based on the characters and not on partiicular book. This is an example of another hit. I remember reading his books before they became movies and I have been hooked to both. Keep them coming
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am in love with this game. A lot of fun and always interesting. Doesn't get boring like other games.
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|Great acting by Eckhart, Liana Daine Liberato. The first part of the movie is a winner, with a good buildup and good picture. The sound effects left much to be desired and Olga Kurylenko was totally wasted, her character feels like it was thrown in at the last minute. Was it worth 10 bucks, well I've spent more than that on movies I've hated and I am a big fan of Aaron.
0061733199|5.0|this manual is very well written and covers just about every situation.  A must read (and great reference) for anyone that wanders in the great outdoors.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK . YEAH it started off a little off but ended in tears God good book can't wait until the movie  I'm first in line for it
0857860801|5.0|I love Amazon, and I love this book. It keeps getting taken out of my hands when I mention I have it. Can't wait for more and more and more Simon's Cat books and videos.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a real fun and addicting game but it does get a little to easy as i continue playing the game. It would be great if developers add a little twist to it like adding an extra lane and more trains so it can atlease be a little more challenging. THANK YOU.
B001P3SA94|5.0|In a few moments I'm going to watch it again, I really love this movie. The first time I watched it I watched it with my ladie and for the first time we watched a movie at home and we didn't say a thing to each other until after the movie.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Loved the story, had me reading every night till I could finish. Read it if you liked the hunger games!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Always enjoy this book.  Simply expressed to benefit anyone approaching the ideas, thoughts, and philosophies contained within the pages for the first time.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A thrilling story. Initially the chapters seem chaotic and the story does not flow, but don't give up a remarkable tale ensues.
1934030554|4.0|If you are training with a power you need this book. Unless you say you use power to be cool.
0525953590|5.0|Well written book about a topic generally not covered well in the media. Some of the explanations gloss over the really complicated stuff, like folding one field into another, but the concept is fairly advanced and difficult to visualize, so the simplification is probably needed. Really enjoyed reading this book.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I received my product on time, I am using this often and mostly daily. I will order this again.  Thanks
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|A little tricky at first but once you get the hang of it, it's a blast!  Imagine learning to drive on an obstacle course doing about 90 mph.  Addictive mayhem!
B003QSMC18|5.0|I liked this one much better than the typical movie where the princess sits around and waits for her prince.  Some parts might be scary for very young children.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this saga centered around World War ll. With significant and memorable characters from all the major countries, Follett draws the reader into the story and holds our attention until the very last page. One of the best books I ever read.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|The story is magically told. It transports you from the rich smells and sight's of Pi's Tamil Nadu through the splendor and might of the Pacific. I'm still thinking about it a week later.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock is a truly great show.  Interesting stories and great actors make this one of my favorites.  I can't wait for Season 3!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|We need more Astronauts like him! Love the journal and upbeat humor of the character. Just the type of person you would want to survive an unwinnable situation.
B001661RC2|5.0|Probably the best Black Keys album to date. Gets better every time I listen to it. Definitely recommend purchasing this album.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I had never seen this before, but I had wanted to.  Prime gave me the chance to see this movie without having to pay extra for it.  I would watch it again.
1594203334|5.0|Both my husband and I read this book and we love it! We couldn't agree more with the parenting style and just love the simplicity of everything. We are expecting our first child in September and we will be referencing this book often.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app....my kids enjoy the horses and all the things you can do...<br />my kids love it.
B00CATONCA|4.0|Less people fighting, and more zombie fighting. Also they need to focus a little more on the how to survive a zombie apocalypse aspects of it.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Never really slowed down. If you're a Clancy fan you'll likely enjoy this one as well.  I'd recommend it to others.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I believe that this season is showing a downward spiral. I was not really interested after the first few episodes and was upset that I spent a few dollars on viewing a let down season.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fascinating look into the life of a navy SEAL.  I've seen these guys training off the coast of Coronado Island and I'd be amazed if any day is ever easy.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|After reading the reviews and watching some of the previews of the film, I could not wait to receive The Intouchables. I knew I was not going to be disappointed. There are quite a few priceless scenes and without spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it, the Maserati scene really conveys the spirit of the interaction between Driss and Philippe right off the bat. Driss' charismatic personality and Philippe's facial reactions and dry comments to some of the outlandish things Driss does throughout this film are so entertaining.  Another one of my favorite scenes is when Driss dances.  Anyone who can't get up and move to Earth, Wind & Fire's Boogie Wonderland would have to be in Philippe's condition and you can see how he longingly looks at Driss and wishes he could participate too! Driss moves like liquid across the dance floor so effortlessly and I loved how his charisma and talent affects the other members of Philippe's staff to get up and begin dancing egged on by Driss to celebrate the party.<br /><br />I felt Cluzet, who played Philippe, did an excellent job portraying a quadriplegic which is not an easy task as he had to rely solely on his facial emotions/comments to carry each scene which he does effortlessly. I could not get over his resemblance to Dustin Hoffman in a couple of scenes.  I loved the interaction between the two men and some of the other staff members as well, in particular Magalie, the red-head, who Driss has the hots for. The movie does not disappoint when it is revealed later Magalie's choice in partners to Driss' surprise after his endless pursuit of her.<br /><br />The score of the film was done by one of my favorite musicians and composer, Italian Ludovico Einaudi, who is an absolute genius.  His minimal style was exactly what was needed in the background so as not to detract from what was going on in the film itself.<br /><br />All in all, this is a movie not to miss. Prepare to be entertained and captivated by this true story!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Keeps you engaged and guessing to the end. Recommended for someone who likes the psychology of characters revealed through story.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very nice A plus app! Very easy to use. I especially like the new  bigger touch area to dismiss the alarm.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are slow in response time. otherwise good. haven't unlocked many games but they are good so far
B0056BMK6K|1.0|This book is a waste of time. I can't believe I fell for it. Apparently this guy pays people to write positive reviews for his POS books. Well gee, if I had the money to do that, I'd start selling books, too.<br /><br />Of course, there's no way to get my money back for the purchase of this book, but what I miss more than the $2.99 I spent on it is my dignity.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addictive,  introduce my family to the game, now they can't get enough,  even my 7 year old niece and brother in law are hooked.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|all right but if you don't pay you don't play and I did not pay.  what I did get for free was pretty good
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is enjoyable, with all of the city building, personalized decorations, and of course the battles.  Only down side is that it takes a while for you energy to rebuild, so there is some down time...take a five minute break, or drop five dollars and everything will be just fine.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|This reads like an incomplete book. The characters are quite stale, the plot predictable, and lacks the usual insight of Crichton on science and society, both abuses and blessings. Far from Crichton best work, but then again, it was finished by Preston. So it's not really a Crichton work.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|I loved the movie so much that I ordered the DVD on Amazon.  The scenery is spectacular, but the music is what impressed me the most.  Haunting and also  bought the CD of the soundtrack
B008J5T4Q4|5.0|Pink really killed it on this one, and her sassy fun attitude really connects with emotion in her new songs. Love love love this record!
B004J0PUP2|5.0|great movie..wonderful music and clear picture.  only criticism.....wish we had subtitles option on all movies, especailly English movies and series.  Had to learn to speak &#34;Australian&#34; with Mclouds Daughters.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought this was a really good book. It kept me wanting to read more and not put it down.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This novel is extremely heartfelt. It shows the heartbreak and joy felt by such lonely people but still is a wonderful read. Although there are depressing situations presented in the flashbacks to the orphanage, the book overall is very clean, and well written. Highly recommend this book, I loved it.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Tom Hanks is at his best in this movie. The movie is wonderfully made. Made me contemplate - on what is really important in life. Follow your heart, be truthful, keep your word, and don't let money or fame change who you are as a human being. Truly inspirational.
0988178532|5.0|Loved this book and can't wait for next one!  A well written, interesting, captivating and exciting novel.  Brandt Legg is an outstanding author.  A must read - wonderful!
160774273X|5.0|Ken Forkish wrote this book for the home breadmaker (or those wanting to learn to be breadmakers). His education and knowledge has been reformulated for bakers of any skill level. the book is exceptionally well written, directions are very thorough and the science behind baking bread is explained. Equipment and tools recommended are easy to find and present in most kitchens already. Ingredients recommended can be found at your local grocery store. Such a wealth of knowledge is shared to help others start or hone their breadmaking and pizza making craft.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It's an interesting film; it can be quite suspenseful and intriguing at times though it requires it's viewers to be well rested and paying full attention to get into the movie since it's quite slow.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor is extremely well written and the story itself is simply gutwrenching at times. What our service members pay for us to have freedom is demonstrated vividly in this book. The story is very hard to put down and the detail is excellent.
B0091JQH2Q|4.0|My personal favorites when it comes to full Sibelius symphonic cycles are the suave set of Colin Davis with the Boston Symphony and the darker, more roughly-hewn renditions by the Helsinki Philharmonic under Leif Segerstam. I also enjoy Leonard Bernstein's versions with the New York Philharmonic and the venerable set featuring the Halle Orchestra conducted by John Barbirolli. I've not heard Paavo Berglund's other two traversals of the Sibelius symphonies, but this set certainly more than holds its own with the likes of Bernstein and Barbirolli, though it doesn't replace my top two. I especially like the performances of the Nos. 3 and 4, and No. 6 comes off fine as well. My only real quibble, and it's a small one, is with respect to the beginning of No. 5 -- right at the start there's a moment of too-much-hesitation followed by too-much-speed at about the 2:30 mark, after which things quickly settle down just fine and it's a smashing performance from then on. All in all, actually, every one of the symphonies is given a fine to excellent playing. Also included are good renditions of various tone poems or other works -- though in a couple cases they are incomplete, such as only the Intermezzo and Alla marcia from the Karelia Suite. If you are needing to balance performance and price, I'd have to say that this set is perhaps irresistible.
B0030V0PEW|3.0|Checklist Manifesto is well written with lots and lots of examples on how checklist have saved lives and how they could have saved lives or made people more functional. That said it didnt take an entire book to convey the message. While there are some good tips on making list there is a shortage of helping users in the process and considerations of making list.
B0048KXRR6|4.0|Perhaps not as good as the first, but still fun to watch, and worth seeing at least once.  Great movie to watch with children.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Chris Anderson is a great writer putting in perspective todays technologies and helping the reader to understand how they apply. Chris uses hands on experience (literally) and his understanding of future trends as a guide for people today.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|My husband has seen the movie a hundred times.  We have seen Mamma Mia on and off Broadway.  My grandkids all know the ABBA songs.  Love it, love it, love it.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|A little slow, might be better to watch the snow melt snore, snore, snore, snore, snore, snore off to sleep.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great show so far. Can't wait to watch Season 3. It's a great way to see life from another perspective. Not one I would care to live, but a taste of what it might be like.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|My 9 year old is reading it.  I don't have to nag too much to get him to read.  That works for me.
B000N90JG8|5.0|I absolutely think this is one of the best movies ever.  If you like romance/comedy movies and are a Jack Nicholson fan then you will<br />love it too.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|3D and Digital Copy only. In order to get both a 2D and 3D copy you have to purchase two different sets of this movie. I would have definitely purchased a combo pack with both the 2D and 3D Blu-Rays included. Bad marketing Disney!!<br /><br />UPDATE: Disney gave purchasers of the 2D Combo pack the offer to purchase the 3D disc for $5.99, which came out to about $28 total. It was well worth the money. Best 3D movie I've seen at home. I guess if you complain enough, companies will listen. I gave it 5 stars for Disney making it right!
B004EPYZSK|2.0|I usually love alien movies so naturally I wanted to see this film.  It was not good at all.  I was sorry that I wasted over two hours watching this joke of a movie but I continued watching just to see if it would get any better and when I saw it wasn't I just stomached through the rest of it just because.  I really wanted to like this movie but it failed on so many levels.  The story line was weak and just didn't make much sense.  It had a lot of things they didn't explain so you were confused as to why certain things were happening.  very glad I didn't spend 10 dollars in the movies or I would have been very upset now.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Waste of money!  Far too slow moving to hold my attention.  I know the author had the intent to show how we live and learn in our lives, but it just didn't come across to this reader.
B003Y059EK|4.0|the movie was pretty well done - Dorothy was good - seemed to be a combination of other Oz books
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have watched other versions of jane austen's works and none of the Pride and Prejudice movies can compare with this one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed the offbeat, quirky characters. It's an easy read because I was involved in how the main character would resolve his relationships. After being away for four years everyone kept going while he as at a standstill.

B008602KQI|5.0|Always enjoy watching this movie.  It's awesome! Would recommend to anyone that hasn't yet seen it. Cant wait for the next one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book- could not put down.  Will definitely look for more of her novels.  Keep me reading...moves very quickly. Thumbs up.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am addicted to this show.  I can never manage to catch it on tv, but now I've found it is awesome to watch on my kindle.  I often watch while at the gym!!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Really enjoyed it.  Sometimes she did speak out of both sides in terms of tactics she used and advice she has, but still very valuable.  Big take away is that networking is key!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|its entertaining enough.  i enjoyed jennifer lawrence.  the male lead role seems miscasted.  i would picked a different actor for the male lead.  he seemed less believeable.  i felt little affection for his character -perhaps intended by writer.  nonetheless an entertaining movie worth watching.  probably won't unearth any deep philosophical or spiritual insights.  just relax and enjoy.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you want the account of what happened when the heroes of Seal Team 6 caught and killed USB this book will do it.  After reading the book I saw the movie Zero Dark Thirty and the account is generally the same with the book giving the full detail how the team trained for the mission.  Absolutely a great read.  I've always had a great deal of respect for the armed forces of our country, my respect is even greater after reading this book.
0670026557|4.0|Disclosure: I'm a Wharton MBA alum so I wanted to like this book, and mostly I did. Give and Take makes a strong contribution to the ever-growing popular psychology genre. Much of what Grant reports will be familiar to readers, especially those who studied social psychology; however, the discussion of givers vs takers and application to real world business situations will be new.<br /><br />Often Grant adds a new level of explanation to well-known theories; for instance, most of us know about the self-fulfilling prophecy effect: a positively oriented teacher or mentor will influence performance when other factors are controlled. Grant points out that givers are more likely to be the kind of mentors who develop their mentees; they are more aware of hidden talents and more likely to give their time.<br /><br />Grant writes in a conversational style that's easy to read. He illustrates each point with stories, most of which will be new to the reader.<br /><br />Just two quibbles:<br /><br />Gender<br /><br />Grant seems to deny an effect of gender on giving, yet his examples of people who got big by giving seem to be nearly all male. Women are presented negatively, e.g., we meet an exhausted teaching volunteer and a consultant who couldn't say no.<br /><br />I suspect that most organizations expect giving behavior from women; I read a study a long time ago about the different demands on male vs female professors. Women were expected to be more sympathetic to students; a male professor wouldn't be criticized for saying \\"no\\" to more office time or hearing a long personal story, but a woman would.<br /><br />As for sharing credit for ideas, executive women often have no choice. Many women have documented a familiar scenario: they suggest an idea and nothing happens; a few minutes later a male gets an enthusiastic response for the same idea. This phenomenon has been widely reported.<br /><br />Volunteering and Longevity<br /><br />Grant suggests that volunteers live longer than those who don't volunteer. The endnotes led me to the articles he seemed to be citing. The research, he suggests, shows that \\"elderly\\" adults who volunteered were more likely to be alive two or eight years later, depending on the study. The magic number seems to be 40 hours: more hours don't increase longevity.<br /><br />I am suspicious of research findings that support stereotypes of aging, such as the notion that elderly people don't care about money and just want to donate their time to get meaning and satisfaction. Given a choice, I suspect many would rather get paid for productive work that confers some status.<br /><br />I didn't have access to the articles, but a U of Michigan source online provided an abstract and some summary statistics for the eight-year study. The number of hours was self-reported. The authors noted that the effect on longevity was more pronounced on those with lower levels of social interaction, which suggests that meaningful paid work might lead to similar or even better outcomes.<br /><br />And although the authors might have controlled statistically for income, education and other variables, the data presented showed that those who did not volunteer tended to be older and poorer. 74% of those age 75+ did not volunteer, compared to just 58% of those aged 65-69. Additionally, 52% of those with income over $30,000 volunteered, compared to just 23% of those with incomes below $10,000. And 61% of college graduates volunteered, compared to rates of 29% and 48% for grade school and high school grads respectively.<br /><br />Socioeconomic status has long been acknowledged as one of the top predictors of longevity, even in countries with socialized medicine, so it is critical to tease out the possible confounding variables. I would also like to see a comparison with people who work at income-producing jobs they like versus those who are simply \\"retired.\\"<br /><br />I considered emailing Grant for copies of some of these articles or asking the article's authors for reprints. However, I'm hesitant to test their giving natures with a non-essential but potentially annoying request.<br /><br />Anyway, you don't have to be a giver to recommend this book generously to all sorts of audiences. It's a good one.g the article's authors for reprints. However, I'm hesitant to test their giving natures with a non-essential but potentially annoying request.<br /><br />Anyway, you don't have to be a giver to recommend this book generously to all sorts of audiences. It's a good one.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so cool I keep playing over and over and over and over and over and over and over
B0075LTOR2|5.0|This may be a bold statement but I believe it is true. There has not been a band like Roxy Music, a band that fused art, avant-garde, 50's rock, electronic music and other influences into a sound that can only be described as Roxy Music.<br /><br />At least that was the case until \\"Manifesto\\", after that they basically became Bryan Ferry's backing band. By \\"Flesh & Blood\\" the line was officially blurred between Bryan Ferry solo and Roxy Music.<br /><br />This box set comprises the studio recordings of Roxy Music, from the self-titles debut right up to \\"Avalon\\". Actually a similar LP package was released on vinyl back of the first 7 albums. This box is basically the CD version but with the added bonus of \\"Avalon\\" and 2 cd's worth of B-sides, single mixes, dance mixes, and other oddities.<br /><br />The big disappointment was that the box was originally planned to include DVD/high res content but was scaled back to just 10 CD's  with a 2 disc collection of bonus material. This was a major disappointment but what are going to do? The good news is that the box set is actually mastered very well and sounds great. The powers that be decided to utilize the original 2 track masters and transfer them flat so there would be no loss of dynamic range and minimal tweaking as opposed to the Bob Ludwig re-masters. So your getting no brick walling and a more purer sound more close to what the original vinyl LP's sounded like.<br /><br />Just be forewarned that the first album was recorded with a small budget so a lot of audio deficiencies remain. It wasn't until \\"For Your Pleasure\\" that Roxy Music got a bigger budget and was able to use AIR studios with Chris Thomas and the recording shows. Also there are no track notes, essays, lyrics, or other ephemera included. You just get the albums in mini-replica album covers with inner sleeves.  In the end this is a pretty good deal if you don't have any Roxy Music, the price has dropped considerably so you can probably now snag it for under $70 which is a steal considering what your getting.<br /><br />So in summation<br />-you get every Roxy Music album that sounds great.<br />-you get 2 cd's worth of extra stuff like 45 mixes, b-sides, ect.<br />-miniature record sleeves<br />-a real cool boxr $70 which is a steal considering what your getting.<br /><br />So in summation<br />-you get every Roxy Music album that sounds great.<br />-you get 2 cd's worth of extra stuff like 45 mixes, b-sides, ect.<br />-miniature record sleeves<br />-a real cool box
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Season 2 of Stargate SG-1 takes off where seaon 1 ended.  In my opinion the show gets better through its early years.  More of the Stargate universe becomes clear.  I suggest watching season 1 first.  The whole Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantas, Stargate Universe, and 2 movies are free with Amazon prime.  This package alone is worth subscribing.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|The book was great, but the movie buchered it so bad I thought it was a different movie than the book I read. The poor writer. two thumbs down

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is totally addicting!  I find myself constantly waiting for more coins so that I can play more.  I don't even mind the ads.
B00B52F278|5.0|Along with the Walking Dead, this was my favorite series. As much as I loved Andy Whitfield (God bless him and his family), I must say Liam McIntyre was equally outstanding and perhaps even more. It is a bit like comparing your favorite James Bond -- Sean Connery or Roger Moore. All are outstanding and render their own interpretations. I am a PhD in European Military History and approve of this series in the way that they rendered history. We all could have small quibbles about this and that, that the Romans always threw pila (special spears) before closing, that Onamaeus was really a Gaul, not a black man...but what a character he was anyway. The cause of liberty should embrace all human kind and the scriptwriters were courageous and inclusive in making this point. Crixus and Gannicus did exist, the former as a Gaul and the latter as a Celt. Since nothing more is known about them, the scriptwriters were open to their interpretations. Of the three primary accounts about Spartacus, two say he died on the battlefield, and one says the body was never found. This series took the latter interpretation and thereby provided a beautiful ending. The final season seemed a bit compressed compared to the season right before it, but the producers had decided to wind the series down. Another two seasons clearly could have been done. I personally found the acting, the characters (without exception) and the scriptwriters to be outstanding. Some reviewers have commented about the gay characters and scenes. I am a definitely \\"straight\\" Independent Conservative and did not like the first series scenes between Barca and Pietro mostly because I did not like them as men. Agron and Nasir were different because I liked them as men. As an ex-military officer, I would have been proud to stand beside them in battle and share their table. Agron's farewell to Spartacus was particularly moving and apt. The final episode was sensationally moving. I am proud to say that it moved me to tears several times and caused me to scream into the picture and pray to God to be able to help them. Who among us does not understand that there is good and evil and that the cause of brotherhood and liberty are worth dying for?
B002722R64|5.0|Taking a cue from the original Bond, Sean Connery, Brosnan plays the part with the same sophistication, swagger and confidence. His sense of humor and witty banter are spot on, as well. Great action sequences and a terrific cast of supporting actors round out this fun and entertaining film. A must see for any fan of 007 films.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this book to be interesting.  Dr. Alexander set out to give an accurate account of what he experienced while in a coma and to prove that his mind could not have made up these experiences at that time.  I think he does this well. The way he explains that while in the coma his mind could not have been playing tricks on him because it wasn't working at all, seems plausible.<br />I take this all with a grain of salt.  I don't know enough about science and the human body to argue with his points.  I do know enough about God to realize that no matter how sure we think we are about what heaven will be like, our human minds are unable to grasp the reality of it.  What difference does it make whether we can grasp it now or not?  God expects us to have faith in Him and He says it will be awesome!  What more do we need?  Ask Him and He will tell you how to get there!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Im not a fan of high school romance novels. But I must say this one was great. I couldn't put it down.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|If you're a fan of Director Nolan's previous 2 films then you will enjoy this<br />conclusion to his trilogy. Great story, great villains and a beautiful cat woman.<br />I pity the team that gets to reboot Batman after Nolan's epic trilogy. This will be a hard act to follow.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I really like playing this game, but it causes my Kindle to freeze.  One Kindle actually died while I was playing it and I just got a replacement.  When the new Kindle froze while I was playing the game, I uninstalled it.  I'm not taking any more chances!

B004HD61KE|5.0|Devil Colony is exactly what you would expect from Rollins - an action packed adventure through the pages of history with lots of your favorite characters. Great read.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This movie was just around as long as titanic and it was a great movie. By the end, you are literally singing along with it. My father, who wasn't planning on watching this with me, ended up watching it and loved it too. I couldn't get him to stop yelling &#34; Jareth!!!&#34; everytime he had the chance.
B0098756DC|5.0|i had not seen this movie since a late night viewing years ago with commercials,no less.i saw this in Blu-ray for 24$,so grabbed it.will fit nicely with my other Westerns. The pictured quality was amazing,even in black and white.Here's to the man who shot Liberty Valance.
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|I had high expectations for this movie and in truth while watching it I simply came away with the feeling the screenplay was written as a feminist ploy to show how great Alma that it was she who was the real genius instead of Hitchcock. Not a single man in this movie comes off looking good, strong or normal, but all the women come off looking quite wise and strong. correction Hitchcocks agent comes off okay but that might only be as a wink to everyone's agent who stars in the movie.<br /><br />Overall production was good and the supporting cast did a fine job.  I never believed either of the two leads to be who they were playing and for such fine actors i think that speaks greatly to the lousy script and direction<br /><br />I had expected to learn something about the Man who was hitchcock but other then his liking candy corn, I learned zilch.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I was very impressed at the storytelling in this novel. I'm not a big love/romance novel reader but this book provided so much more than that. The subplots of family tragedies (Will, Lake and Eddie) brought me to tears. I was surprised at how much emotion Hoover evoked from me through her characters. I could relate almost instantly. The only thing that threw me off a big was the story being told from first person point of view. I'm not used to reading books in first person but overall, this was a great novel. I would recommend to anyone, young adult or adult.<br /><br />Ericka Simpson<br />Author of New Adult Fiction Novels<br />\\"I am Your Sister\\" and \\"I am Your Sister: Season 2\\"
1439102430|4.0|I'm sure readers of the series are aware that Temperance Brennan in Reichs' books is a completely different character from the television series, but since this is the first book I've read, I was surprised. They share a name and an occupation, but that is it. While it did take me a while to get used to the differences, I found the character in the books to much more to my liking. She's more human and engaging. Reichs' story is a good one, but there were a few too many times where she crammed in a bit of research whether it fit well or not. The one that aggravated me the most was when a minor character was given a genetic condition that affected her condition. It bore absolutely no impact on the case, and it seemed Reichs' had done the research and wanted to get it in. Other parts also were a bit pedantic, but they at least had to do with the story. I just would have liked the information to be provided a bit more seamlessly instead of a lecture that slowed down the story. Those times were not terribly numerous, however, and I did enjoy the book. I will read others in the series.

The \\"One Thing\\" is the best approach, the best lessons, the best advice to get you to understand that it is----SUCCESS, your success, whatever that major plan you want for yourself is the \\"One Thing\\".<br /><br />I invite experts on my  radio show everyday to share ideas,coaching up people,(specifically Baby Boomers) on exactly what Gary and Jay share in their message, that focusing on your thing is and can be done.<br /><br />This book is a written version that can help people on the road, basically it is a lesson in not having fear of success, embracing opportunities and living your amazing dream.<br /><br />I love the focus aspect of the 'target', you have gotta have it to bring it, you will never even come close to hitting the target, let alone the bulls eye without a lesson on focus, these guys nailed it!<br /><br />I would love to interview either one or both of these givers, they walk the walk and that means I betcha they can talk the talk.<br /><br />Peace,

B00127RAJY|5.0|Highly recommend.  Great workout.  Will have you fit and toned in a short period of time.  Did not lose a lot of weight but really toned up.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|Anyone who is a fan of Les Miserables will love this sound track. My only regret was that there were no lyrics included in the liner notes. Also, I am tired of these cardboard cases. I want the old plastic jewel cases for cd's to protect them. If you don't mind no lyrics and a cardboard case, its a must for any Les Miserables fan.
B0013TTLDE|3.0|I'm caught in the Downton Abbey craze and wanted something to fill the void between seasons. This was an excellent escape. Story moves smoothly between time periods and characters are well drawn, yet a bit underdeveloped. Think I'll try another Kate Morton before season premier.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I hate when I have  to wait for a new live! I mean really , when my lives are all gone am I really going to have to wait for a new one!
B003O86FMW|2.0|Definitely written for the young adult market.  Seems very pulp.  Pop pulp. Does a disservice to its intended audience…young adults deserve more self-consistent worlds, compelling plots, descriptive vocabulary, and better and inspiring character development. This is mediocre to awful in all four areas.<br /><br />This final book of the trilogy does provide better background, but continues to make little sense with regards to the size, connections, or motivations of the districts or Capital.<br /><br />With regards to the main character…someone that has some growth, and not continual self-loathing would have been nice.  The further one gets into the book the less likeable or relatable becomes the girl on fire.  She doesn’t so much catch on fire, but merely smolders away.  Disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, I actually enjoyed this book the most of the three.  It is the last part that is so disappointing. It is like the author had a page or time limit.  Got near the end...and just finished.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Simple and easy to use and works great, gives my kindle another function (as if it didnt have enough at the moment)
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I thought this movie was cute but it could have been so much more. Cute chick flick though. I'll watch it again.
6305364648|4.0|Just like this movie, I have seen it many times. Most of them on tv edited so watching this with out the editing is even better!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I wanted to try The Piano Guys, because they sounded more interesting then smooth jazz. They are fun and soothing.<br />You can always listen to a few cuts before you decide, but I recommend this group
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Of all the books in the Fifty series, this one is my  favorite.  It explains Christian and why he is the way he is.  LOVE THIS BOOK!  COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This is a great show.  I would recommend this series to anyone.  I am excited to watch the final season when it comes to Amazon.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Certain aspects of Ferris Bueller's Day Off are dated, but keeping it historical (80s) context, it is still every bit as much fun and funny as it was then.  It is a true John Hughes classic that will always resonate with the &#34;kids&#34; of that generation, but is funny enough to keep everyone entertained.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is pretty good. I would recommend it to people especially if they need something to pass time :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Trying to put fun apps on my device so my kids enjoy the kindle? Thank you for marking this apps.
B009K916ZK|5.0|This product is exactly what I needed. I received it on time and am happy with my purchase. I'm glad I decided to go with a true Apple product instead of a knock-off.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Speeds up really fast and characters are too many coins.<br />It is entertaining though. And when it offers an update, it is impossible to download and go straight back to the game- very annoying.
B000V8842C|5.0|I have been collecting a lot of recordings with piano versions of Domenico Scarlatti's sonatas and this is one of the sweetest.<br /><br />The other reviews have mentioned some other good choices (after you buy this one); in addition to those, I'd recommend Alice Ader's recording ([[ASIN:B00BVBEBEI Scarlatti: Keyboard Sonatas]]).
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|i think it is a fun app it keeps me occupied but i have the kindle fire and it doesnt let u record things
B009IEXKXI|5.0|WOW. What a fast paced thrill ride. From the first page to the last, it just never slowed down. What wasn't thrilling was just laugh out loud funny. A definite must read.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It was different than the movie, I enjoyed it very much. I look forward to reading the other books also.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me captive the entire time.  I really enjoyed reading it and tell everyone to read it if they haven't!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is wounderfull, I keep in touch with many friends, that perhaps I do noticia see often, and by this way I know what they are doing
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I like this movie as it doesn't have inappropriate contents so that I can watch it with my daughter and the whole family especially when she is reading the book. There are a few shinning words in movie.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book.  If you have been struggling with articulating the problems endemic in many large organizations with how business processes around IT and Software Development are broken, this is your book.  Not only is it educational, it is fun to read.  The authors do a great job building a set of characters and business problems that are realistic and that many in our industry can relate to.  If all you get from this book is an understanding of how queued work and wait-times in highly variable systems behave it will be well worth it.  This understanding alone can completely change how managers and executives book resources and arrange workers to accomplish business goals.  IT work is physically invisible and this makes it deadly to ignore the real physics involved.  Phoenix walks you and the characters through some surprising discoveries and illustrates some solutions to the IT bottleneck.  Readers from IT and software will identify with the scenarios, people and dysfunctions explored.<br /><br />I have been gifting copies to co-workers.  It is the best $10 gift that will have an astronomical payback.  This book will help lead a revolution around Lean Thinking, Continuous Delivery and simply getting more out of software and the valuable resources that build our systems that are running the world.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and recommend it to all who thoroughly enjoy the Bible and want to spread the true meaning of gods word
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A bit of a rough start. Didn't know how I would like a rough, country man who hated young children and mothers nor how a relationship with a refined, sheltered teacher would work out. The horrible interludes of Jamie's beginnings as 86 give glimpses into why he lives apart, and why he's so miserable still. Couldn't say I saw what was coming until Lydia got her letter. A more appropriate outcome.
0307951529|5.0|This is a very inspirational book. It will encourage the reader to go out and get going with their business idea. It showcases many entrepreneurs that did just this. It's focuses on solopreneurs and small businesses that intend to stay small. It is not a how-to book. It doesn't have the details on getting your business actually started. The only criticism I would have of the book it is negative or discourages investor-backed businesses, franchises, and businesses built to be an asset (as well as an income for the owner) that can be sold at some point in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|...and all the different translations. You can set it to remind you to read each day, you can browse in all the different translations - and it now has the Holman Standard in it as well, which we use for Bible Drill.
B0042VVLJM|3.0|Not terribly accurate and contains a scene of full nudity.  And it's really long.  Would not recommend this version of the movie.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|... that once you hit 150-200 items, like I did, that it would be a little more manageable. I would love a &#34;Add all non-final items&#34; to the screen. Or maybe categories...<br /><br />All in all, it is a great entertainer when waiting in line, or at the doctor, etc. Love the fact that they have accounts so each user can have their own set of items, and discover all of them on their own.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|The offline maps are nice for devices that only connect to the internet with WIFI or even if your phone doesn't get good service
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The one issue with this game is that I lose all track of time when playing it!<br />I highly recommend this game.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great acting, writing, directing, great everything. Very solid cop drama. More shows need to take a few notes from The Shield.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really don't know what more you could say. G5 consistently produces great game after great game. I have played a lot of HO adventure games and this company never disappoints. Thanks, Nancy Bettac Barton, grammacozy62
B0064MGU98|5.0|Watching season 1 for a second time and love catching the many details I missed the first round. This show feels fresh and exciting even the second time through.
B001D09OAI|4.0|When I'm looking for a feel good story with a few laughs, this is one of my go to movies
0062127241|2.0|Like almost everything Pete Townsed did after 1975, it took way too long to complete, and just isn't that good.  Unless you like detailed accounts of every piece of equipment in every studio that he had, I wouldn't recommend this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent Book and came just as described. Thank you and I will buy from you again.  Quick and smooth transaction.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I chose to watch this because it just looked funny and I like the humor in the MTV series. I got addicted to it after the first episode. This deserved the 5 stars. Quality humor I say. You guys should watch it.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|This is pathetic! 3-D home viewing is struggling enough with the prices still not really coming down much.  Now to make matters worse, Disney makes the 3-D version not include the 2-D Blue Ray, but includes the download??? What?  Who thinks this stuff up?  Bad choice. I may skip this 3-D Blue Ray altogether, I plan to get a 3-D TV soon, but until that time, I like the 2-D versions included and even though I have the 3-D discs, I can enjoy the film that way until I get the actual TV.  Now?  Well, guess my hands are being tied and will lean towards 2-D only. Nice work House of Mouse.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down. So many twists and turns. Can't wait to start A Feast of Crows
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Game of Thrones has a solid script that draws you in. The Characters are easy to follow. The scenes are very well done and believable. There is a lot of violence, so if you are not one for that, I wouldn't recommend this show. I do like the underlying humor in some of the character dialogue. I hope this one keeps coming back for many more seasons.
B000I3UMKM|2.0|I had heard that this was a \\"classic\\" movie, a \\"must-see\\", and perhaps Audrey Hepburn's best performance.  Quite frankly, it was none of these for me.  I will posit a contrary view and flatly state that I did not enjoy this movie.  The best part of the movie by far was Henry Mancini's classic song, \\"Moon River\\" (it won an Oscar for best song).  Watching Audrey sing this song (while pretending to play a guitar) was the high moment of the film.  Now that I have seen the movie, I don't consider it a classic, nor do I recommend it as a \\"must-see\\".  As far as Hepburn's best performance, I thought her work in \\"Wait Until Dark\\", and \\"My Fair Lady\\" was much better.  The film is about a quirky, disorganized, insecure woman, Holly Golightly (Hepburn,) who does not know who she is, so she looks for security by attempting to marry and have someone take care of her.  Peppard's character, who also finds himself in a situation where he is dependent on a woman who pays him for sexual favors, realises he loves Holly GoLightly (Hepburn), and is willing to risk everything to share a lifetime love with her.<br /><br />My chief complaint about the film is not with Hepburn (she is wonderful as Holly Golightly), or George Peppard as her leading man; no, the film falls short for me in the script.  For me, the script was not compelling, romantic, or even that funny (the film is billed as a romantic comedy).  One severely dated character in the film is the role of Mr. Yonoshi, played by Mickey Rooney.  He (unfortunately) uses every Japanese stereotype in the book in a comedic way, as Hepburn's apartment manager.  By today's standards, Rooney's characterizations are offensive and completely tasteless.  (Yet, this is 1961, and before the era of political correctness).<br /><br />I realize others rate this a 5-star movie.  When I compare it to other 5-star movies, in my opinion, it falls far short of the mark.<br /><br />kone
B00BGIC170|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie and was glad to see when it was finally avaliable for rental.  Perhaps I am not as experienced as other movie watchers to know when to avoid the unrated version of a movie - however I will take this as a learning expense.  The reason I gave it 2 stars was because there were many SSSLLLOOOOWWW parts of the movie.  The funny parts were very funny indeed, but the amount of wasted time in between was nearly unbearable.  During these times my husband and I would use it to refill our drinks, put the baby back to bed, transfer a load of laundry from the washer to the dryer, start another load of laundry, fold clothes that were in the dryer and put them away.  WOW, that's a lot to do during a movie that you'd think you would miss important or funny parts.  Nope.  I seriously would've rather rented this from an off site location - I would've rather driven to rent the movie and driven back to return it; it could've saved SO much money than going through Amazon.  Lesson learned.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Translates perfectly to the Android OS. Very fun and EASY to get into. The first two levels teach you all you need to know to play the game. Everything else is all in your nogg'n. Works on AT&T Skyrocket and Note (1).
0061684384|5.0|great book all of hers are really good..thanks again and look forward to further business with you again keep up the great work
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I am not sure exactly where he was, but I don't believe he was in the heaven of the Bible.  God is never referred to as Omm and there is nothing in scripture that talks of various levels of heaven.  Seems more like some type of Eastern religion where you try to advance from the lower haven to the higher heavens by doing good works.  Nothing was mentioned of Jesus or worshiping God.  Very materialistic heaven.  Not the heaven of the Bible.
B005QJZ5FA|1.0|I was most amazingly disappointed and annoyed to have spent one cent on this worthless excuse of a music CD. I have listened to many thousands of bands and solo singers over the spanse of my life. I have never felt the urge to comment about any music bought on Amazon, but this piece of venomous splooge needed to be called out as utter trash. This solo artist needs serious mental therapy period. Please don't release any more musical garbage until your outlook on life improves or go jump off that cliff and end it.  Because your songs appear to pass on the message you no longer wish to breathe.  Sheeeeesh !!

B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sandberg does a great job of clearly explaining the problems and recommends intermin solutions. In the book she uses a lot of the same anecdotes from previous speeches and interviews, so those familiar with her cause will get some repetition. Otherwise, it's a great summary of the issues and her stance; a quick easy read.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It's a fun game with cute animations. Pretty easy, at least in the first episode, that's as far as I've played so far. It's addicting too. Not sure<br />why it's called pudding monsters though. It looks more like jello. A game for all ages but if it gets too tough it may start to frustrate younger children. But overall a great game.
B004CURZFC|5.0|We loved this movie. We had seen the 2D version before and really liked it. Once we got the 3D TV, we couldn't wait to see the 3D version. We were not dissappointed.
B003QCCS36|4.0|Nice new direction for Ray, but it's taken me some time to get used to this, since I'm such a fan of his previous music.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|Music beyond wonderful  acting so good seemed natural  will watch many times  and always enjoy the music and the the moral of the story !
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|No one interprets lyrics like Madeleine.  If you're a fan, this won't disappoint.  If you weren't a fan, you will be one as soon as you hear her voice, arrangements, and amazing range.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This is one of the best of the Harry Hole novels in my opinion.  This is where he really goes off the rails emotionally, yet still solves the case and saves the day.  Great read!
B001AX9DT0|5.0|This doesn't disappoint, and it's one I listen to over and over.  Mellow enough to be background, but you won't want to miss a single word.  More than a great musician, he's a great storyteller.
B000002J5K|5.0|1 of the best sound tracks of all time.  Not only is the movie one of the best, but the music totally makes it.  Love it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game .  Very relaxing.  Great graphics and love the music.  I can't wait to get through all the levels,.  Hope they come up with another one to play after this one.
0345803507|5.0|These books are musts, especially for the ladies.  If you don't own them, you should.  Start with the first and read all of them - I haven't come across anyone who was disappointed.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I love Kathy Reichs books but this is one of my least favorites. The details and character development that I love about the Temperance Brennan books seemed to be missing. It's still a ok read just not one of my favorites.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an excellent story which explains the difficult training of the SEALS and the tough job that lies ahead for them. It  explains his childhood which readied him for the career at  an early age.  The ordeal of Marcus and his fellow teammates was told very vividly; I could picture myself there watchig it.  I am a veteran and could feel hurt and compassion for him and what Marcus and his teammates went through.  It had me in tears at times.  It explains the rules of engagement (ROEs) which ties their hands at times and puts them in danger from the enemy.  I do not believe the powers to be in place should put such restrictions on our military men and women fighting.  If they feel their life is in danger or their position is compromised by the enemy, they should be able to do what they must to protect themselves without the worry of court martial or prison, those men's lives could have been saved if the ROE's had not made them make the choice they made.  I highly recommend it. It will really open up your eyes more about the war.  This is my 4th book about the Navy SEALS. Well worth the money and time to read it.
B0001IMCDE|1.0|Looked all over for this movie and bought it here finally. However, it's a region 2 and won't play on any of my players. They really shouldn't sell wrong region DVDs  even though it was at the bottom of the ad.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't care for it in the beginning (season 1) as it was my husband who wanted to check it out. But by episode 2 back then I was hooked..probably more than him \\"making\\" him watch as many as 4 episodes in one evening. Now we're caught up and have to wait for the next season to start :-(
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I AM ENJOYING THIS BOOK SO FAR.  IT CERTAINLY GIVES A LOT OF INSIGHT INTO &#34;POLITICKING&#34; THAT NEVER REACHES THE DAILY NEWS AND MOST PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE OFF.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BOOK TO ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN HISTORY, OR THE WORKINGS OF THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT, ESPECIALLY CHANGING OFFICE.<br />ONE ONLY SEES WHAT THE PRESS, OR, WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISERS WANT YOU TO SEE THAT KEEPS THE PRESIDENT IN THE BEST LIGHT.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This is awesome and worked on my Kindle to read to me while I work.  It is awesome! Smooth transaction!
B00005JKDR|4.0|I was very pleased with the delivery time. The dvd case was in great condition. Unfortunately there is one little skip in the beginning of the movie. Other than that it plays great. It plays well enough that I am not returning it.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|When I listened to the first song on the cd it had a familiar feel to it. The sound is that of Classic Rock, I love this cd, especially Stevie Nicks' song, &#34;You Can't Fix This.&#34; I recommend this cd to anyone who is a fan of Classic Rock.
B001IFZL50|5.0|A definite buy.  Would recommend to anyone.  Shows soldiers in and out of their element.  Intense and funny all at the same time.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I like pac man but you should make more levels and harder levels because they are too OMG it is good
0062082353|5.0|First let me say that Chris will truly be missed.  Next, what an amazing autobiography.  Chris is a great story teller.  You wouldn't thing a trained killer would be funny and engrossing, yet Kyle is definitely all that.  You'll love this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm beyond speechless. John green is a beautiful person and I hope he writes until it's no longer possible. This book has opened my eyes to so much and wow I'm just uh wow. Thank you for writing this John green.
0307719774|5.0|Love it, thought provoking questions, but yet simple. Exactly what I was expecting and looking for. Great book, would definitely recommend to someone who has very little time to keep journals, This is quick, easy, to the point and great to keep for years to come.
B001DBMBNE|5.0|The story goes that producer Bob Johnston (a leading Columbia Records producer who also produced 2 or 3 of Bob Dylan's &#34;electric&#34; albums) used Dylan's studio band to record the backing tracks to &#34;Sounds of Silence&#34; that propelled it from a lovely, soft folksy ballad into a true Top 40 rock hit. It is said he did this without the knowledge of Simon or Garfunkel. While that is true, it would not have been released in that &#34;rockier&#34; version if the duo had resisted very much. They liked it. And saw the wisdom of it, given the times. A lot of their music that followed might have sounded quite different if not for Johnston's vision and the resulting acceptance of the single.<br />Having said all that, this is a great album, and a lot of it is STILL the earlier &#34;folksy&#34; music fans had come to expect. That trend would continue through their careers, and the juxtaposition of softer, more melodic songs with hard, biting satire seemed to define them.
B008220D5K|5.0|If you have kids, if you have a partner anywhere near their 40's, if you've ever just wanted to throw your arms up and give into the stress in life, the fact that no one is a perfect parent, and that everyone should embrace the F word, then this movie is worth ever minute of your 2+ hours.  My husband and I + our best friends (with 6 kids between us) laughed the entire way through the movie and could not wait for it to come out on video.  It was a nice reminder not to take ourselves so seriously and enjoy the life we have.  We highly recommend this movie and respectfully disagree with those who disliked so much of it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|GREAT OPTION FOR ANYONE WHO DOESNT WANT TO GO TO THE GYM! A must buy for those who don't want to deal with steroids and smells at the gym.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I expected a lot more from this film.  It was so slow moving I almost didn't finish it.  The very weak action scenes at the end were dark and undefined.  Throughout the film I was trying for follow who everyone was.  I guess you were just supposed to know who the lady was and why she was lurking on the side lines during prisoner interrogations?  Seal Team Six, was a much better film.  I was on the edge of my seat watching it.  After waiting for months for Zero dark Thirty,  I was very disappointed in it.  I'm glad I didn't spend the money to see it in a theater.  I would have been really mad if I had.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This was a great movie thrilling ,exciting ,moving it was fast paced and eye apealing to me the actors gave a believable performance that made want to see even more missions exciting stunts and very memorable performance want more give me more
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Your children can access the app store without any passwords and buy whatever they want through this app.  Parental controls and passwords do nothing with this app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fabulous writing, gorgeous concept, beautifully executed.  Reminds me of Molly Gloss's &#34;The Dazzle of Day,&#34; another fantastic read.  Both books bring you a contained new world: &#34;WOOL&#34; is an underground silo and &#34;Dazzle&#34; a generations-spanning spaceship ... I am in awe of Mr. Howey's writing.  &#34;WOOL&#34; is phenomenal.  Characters are so real, I feel I could reach out and touch them.  Read it.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Good movie. Interesting premise. A bit hard to believe though, but still enjoyable. Marisa Tomei is always great! Ryan Phillipe plays a great bad guy.

B007KZY1YY|1.0|Fifty Shapes of Crappe<br /><br />The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy by E L James is so wretched on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin. A British export, its cringe-worthiness is on a par with Prince Charles's leaked love note to Camilla that he'd like to be a tampon in her trousers so that he could be inside her constantly. There's even a yucky tampon scene in Fifty Shades!<br /><br />James seems to have inverted the basics of any creative writing class in her constant reliance on telling, rather than showing, what happens in her story. That's one problem right there: there is no story, just a mishmash of the same sex scene every couple pages, repeating the same words (lots of hot staring, fists grasped in hair, his fingers circling her \\"down there,\\" explosive mutual orgasms). At first it's sort of stimulating but then after the hundredth time with his circling fingers turning her into \\"a quivering, mess\\" (yes, the mistaken comma is there with lots of other typos, misspellings, and bad grammar), you get irritated and start skimming over the boring sex scenes. Wait, isn't that why I bought this naughty book? I've had better sex myself. Poor Ana.<br /><br />Speaking of Ana---here we supposedly have a twenty-two-year-old college grad who is a virgin and has never felt even a glimmer of sexual arousal. She's never masturbated. We know she's read novels (she's a lit major) but apparently even her imagination remained inviolate.  So, sexually she's a blank slate with the emotional maturity of a child. The first time she meets Christian, he makes her \\"feel like an errant child.\\" In his presence, she's often wide-eyed or speaks in a tiny voice; her \\"inner goddess\\" twirls and skips about. She puts her hair up in pigtails and refers to her body parts in childish terms like \\"my bottom\\" or \\"down there.\\" She describes a dress she's borrowed from her roommate as showing off her \\"few curves,\\" so she's not a voluptuous woman. With him, she fidgets and squirms, stuttersand cringes, blushes and has a kid's nervous habit of chewing on her lower lip, which fires up sadomasochistic Christian (\\"I'd like to bite that lip,\\" he whispers darkly).The lip-chewing bit happens over and over again, until you're ready to toss the book on the floor. Ana's inner dialogue is ripe with phrases like \\"Oh crap,\\" \\"Holy cow,\\" \\"Oh my,\\" ad nauseum. But one thing has really pleased her so far-- she's remembered to shave her legs for her date with Christian! She sounds and acts like a thirteen-year-old girl.  Which explains why hot and handsome Christian is attracted to this whiny, little (she's petite), sorry excuse for a woman. She's an unblemished creature he can violate and bend to his will. Basically, he's a pervert seducing a little girl.<br /><br />But Christian sure helps Ana grow up in a hurry. Within a week of meeting her, he has seduced her and taken her virginity. The very first time she has sex with him, she experiences orgasm. It's just not believable that a virgin would have an orgasm through penetration while her hymen is being broken. She also informs us that his penis is enormous and he's a magnificent lover (and how would a virgin know this?).  This \\"uncoordinated, scruffy\\" (as she describes herself) co-ed, who usually wears sneakers and jeans, is treated by Christian to a designer wardrobe, fitting her perfectly. Immediately, she is able to slide gracefully in and out of her lover's sports cars, SUVs, or helicopter (even sans panties); somehow she leads off on the dance floor at a fancy dress ball wearing a long, elegant dress and four-inch Christian Louboutin heels. Then, having never before performed fellatio, she grasps the concept with enthusiasm and apparently even surpasses the talents of Linda Lovelace.<br /><br />Ah, but what princess rewards--a dashing lover with a fabulous apartment who is incredibly rich (this twenty-seven-year-old head of a global enterprise makes one hundred thousand dollars an hour!), an elegant wardrobe shows up in her closet! a state-of-the-art computer and a brand-new Audi are delivered! money appears in her bank account as if by magic! anything he can lay at her feet! Meanwhile, he buys the small publishing company where she worked as an underling for a week right out of college, gets rid of her vile boss , the editor, when he tries to force her to have sex in a highly unlikely scenario, and she is installed as editor in his place. When she is at work, she is constantly writing very explicit e-mails to Christian. It's all so silly.<br />When James tries to convince us how incredibly posh Christian's monied lifestyle is, her efforts are laughable: their champagne is always pink; when he shows her around his boat, he points out his office in the \\"front\\"  (it's \\"forward\\" and \\"aft\\" not front and back on a boat); the engraved dinner card placed on tables for a private party touts adjectival descriptions of the food, such as \\"creamy\\" that you would see only on a restaurant menu; the aviation terminology for the helicopter scenes could use an editor. Actually these books desperately needed an editor on many levels, if only to weed out the repetitions and incongruities: for example, when Christian's helicopter goes missing one day for about eight hours, his sister is described as having \\"red-rimmed, sleep deprived eyes,\\" though it is only early evening of the same day.<br />These books are just a juvenile princess fantasy at work with the added zing of the BDSM lifestyle thrown in for kicks. And, judging from other readers' comments, readers who are more knowledgeable than me in that regard (I don't judge anyone their particular tastes in lovemaking), even that is not realistically depicted. As Ana ponders (p. 164, first book), \\"Do I really want to know the extent of Christian's depravity?\\" No, and nor do I.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Enjoyed the historical lineage review of the Tudors, but there are historical inaccuracies throughout. The script changes help the story interesting. Great photography, scenery and costumes help to support this great series.
B0012HRJEA|3.0|I rented this movie to watch with my daughter that is in high school studying Romeo and Juliet.  It is a good version!
B00008EY9G|5.0|This is a terrific movie full of excellent actors! it is very witty and has a twisty to it, actually a few!<br /><br />I normally ALWAYS figure out the synopsis by the first 1/3 of the movie, but I didn't with this one and these kind of movies I always want to own.<br /><br />This one is one that each time you watch it you pick up something else from it.. I think I've seen it 5 times and I still say &#34;oh yeah....&#34;. But I do surf online when I watch movies, hee hee<br /><br />All in all if you like good scary movies, this is a MUST!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great puzzle app for all ages. Easy to do for young kids and hard ones do adults.
159514188X|1.0|This writing is in need of some serious editing, but that is not the main problem with it. The book sold well because suicide of children has become a serious epidemic in America since so many children have been put on mind altering drugs to control their emotions. Now, the public is searching for easy answers that will not cause conflict with the pharmaceutical, medical and State health agencies. It also sold because there are few books on the subject, other then a few honest medical doctors who have written the truth; such as \\"Drigging Are Children.\\" Because of these issues, most books on the subject are being bought quickly, regardless of quality. This book seems to glorify suicide by explaining in detail the reasons for the child committing suicide. Being a parent of a child lost by suicide (induced by SSRI drugs), I thought the book was weak on knowledge of the subject and dangerous because it failed to show the devastation suicide creates.

0385349947|4.0|Sheryl clearly raises the topic of the inequality of men and women in the workplace with this book. She offers guidance and encouragement for women to be more fully engaged in their careers.  Sheryl also offers explanation of why there are different views when women are engaged and when men are. We must all begin to act and treat each other as equally capable contributors. A great read that breaths new fire into the debate of women in the workplace.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The third in the series and by far one of the best.  We can only wish that the author had lived to give us more because his writing was amazing.  It kept me hooked from the beginning.

B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I'm all for a comedy that has some good drama, but this was just bad.  Also, it was too long.  Judd Apatow needs to stick to crude humor - he's more Farrelly brothers than a drama director.
B008602KQI|1.0|I'm sorry, this movie does not explore relationships well, and the books are all about relationships. Yes, there is plenty of action in the books, but you don't know why in the movies why all of this is so important what the ties are between these people or what motivates them. Important events are left out, I just found this movie drab, the shaky cam filming at the beginning annoying and I just wanted it to be over. (I saw at the theater with my daughter, she didn't like the movie either)Sorry The Hunger Games fans, I didn't like it, that is not to insult you, because I thoroughly enjoyed the books.

B004SVM7BW|1.0|I purchased this app to use on my android phone and kindle fire HD.  It is the exact same app and the exact same version on both devices...but on my android phone, I can add my google drive account and edit my files and save them back to drive.  On the Kindle Fire HD, the only options are box.com, dropbox, and microsoft skydrive.  Why can I not use google drive on my kindle fire?  That is where I have all of my files stored and I am not about to change all of that because of one app.  If you are not going to support google drive, that is one thing...but why do you give me the option on one device and not the other?  Please fix this!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Blu-ray is amazing as always. Video is crisp and clear, surround sound is loud and booming. Digital copy (thankfully not a Flixter/UltraViolet copy) was easy to download and transfer around.<br /><br />Movie itself is a rather well done. I consider myself a fanboy and I tend to pick apart all comic book made movies but this one is hard to do. They did take some artistic-librities here and there, but overall the purpose was well served and amazingly done. I particularly liked how they setup all the storyline necessary to do any number of sequels. The Peggy/Sharron Carter story lines, The Bucky/Winter Soldier story lines, the Cosmic Cube (aka the Tesseract) story line, etc etc. Overall, I really did enjoy the movie.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I was intrigued when I saw that this one was a steampunk paranormal romance.  Those elements together just sounded so delicious so I just had to read this one.  I'm glad that I did because it was a delight from cover to cover.  The emphasis was mostly on the paranormal with the steampunk probably a distant third behind the historical.  I was enthralled by the world building the author created so I do not mention the emphasis as a negative, but just an observation.<br /><br />The story revolves around Honoria Todd who has brought her younger brother and sister into hiding with her into the Rookeries which are the poorest and most dangerous part of town to avoid discovery.  They remain hidden for a few months living hand to mouth while Honoria and her sister both work, but it is only a matter of time before The Devil of Whitechapel, the lord of this underworld area, comes to collect his due for letting her live in his territory.  Honoria has so many secrets and she is afraid of this Blue Blood rogue, but she refuses to cower.<br /><br />Blade has grown up hard as a poor boy and while he rules his little empire in the slums well, his focus has always been revenge.  He sees Honoria as a pawn that he can utilize against his hated enemy because Vickers wants her too.  Honoria is full of secrets and he's determined to get them out of her just as he soon realizes that he is determined to have her for his own.<br /><br />The a monster, a blue blood taken over by the virus and now completely vampire, is loose in the Rookeries and Honoria's secrets are all coming to a head.  She has to determine if she can trust Blade and he has to prove himself trustworthy before it is too late.<br /><br />The plot and world building of this one intermingle well.  I liked how information is given about the background of this world even while the plot races along at a good pace.  Not once did I feel clueless from not enough or bored from too much info at once.  It was well handled.  The plot has a few twists though they are fairly mild and easy to work out if one pays attention.  This is not a disappointment because it isn't the focus anyway.  The focus is always about the building relationship and character growth of Honoria and Blade.  Those two were combustible together whether it was the tension that crackled between them, their verbal sparring or the passion when it finally arrived.  There are wonderful secondary characters and I enjoyed getting to know them.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book in this wonderful series.  This would appeal to those who enjoy Paranormal and/or Steampunk Romances.as a few twists though they are fairly mild and easy to work out if one pays attention.

B006CDCWDM|3.0|The book looked like it had been on a dusty shelf for a long time - I was disappointed that it didn't look brand new.  I'm sure it was just shelf-ware, but I was giving it as a gift, so I was disappointed.

B005K17RU0|1.0|This was the go-to weather app on my Kindle every morning for my at-a-glance weather forecast. But after the update, I hate it. The large simplified color icons have been replaced by tiny b/w icons so that I now have to search on the screen just to find the info I'm looking for. All I wanted, and had, was a great, simple weather app to tell me quickly what the day had in store. now I need a degree in meteorology just to find out the temperature. Can I go back to the old version?
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This disc had to grow on me during the 2nd spin around, and I must admit, it's a trippy little joint here.  Some of the songs are very catchy, like PYRAMID & CRACK ROCK...I kept singing these tunes over and over.  It's a lot to take in, but when you do, it's not a dissapointing ride.  In fact, I truly enjoyed it!  This guy has a lot to offer music, and after this, I hope he stays around for a while.

B002W7J3SO|4.0|If I could give &#34;North by Northwest&#34; 4 1/2 stars I would.  But that doesn't seem possible.  The storyline, cast, special effects, sets, and scenery are fine but I don't think the movie overall is quite as good as &#34;Vertigo.&#34;  That film I regard as Hitchcock's masterpiece and it wouldn't be right to give &#34;North by Northwest&#34; the same rating.<br /><br />As to the quality of the video and audio transfer, those are also topnotch in &#34;North by Northwest.&#34;  The scene in the open prairie with a crop duster chasing Cary Grant has to be one of the most memorable and well-done special effects in cinematic history.  Never mind that it doesn't make a lot of sense to the plot to have such a deadly scene in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />Climbing around on facsimile faces of Mt. Rushmore is also very well done, but again implausible anyone could be allowed access.  As with other of Hitchcock's movies, we must learn to suspend logic and plausibility and just enjoy the ride.<br /><br />This is a long movie but worth the time in many ways.  Highly recommended action/mystery/thriller.
B000WDSZ8E|5.0|It was great seeing the first show.  I started seeing the show in the middle of the first season, so this was great to have.  Thank You
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Don't take this movie too seriously, but it is a good film. its funny, scary, and catchy. Would say get it and add it with the collection.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|This is one of the finest comedy that has come out it a long time.  It was a great price and it did not take very long to reach me.  Thanks.
B005LAII44|5.0|I went to see this with my Father when it first came out and we both loved it. It's fun and funny, action packed and I loved every second. I however don't think this is a good film for people who are hung up on the comic or the cartoon version of GI JOE though, like many other films this is a new version and doesn't completely follow former versions like the cartoon. So if you base your opinion on that than this is not the movie for you, but otherwise it's great and I've so got this on pre-order.

B003HGKJH8|5.0|I heard a couple tracks from Lonerism and decided to check out their older work. This blew me away, in fact it was more enjoyable to listen to straight through. I dont know much about the genre. But this is great music if you have the slightest inclination toward psyc-rock. Sound Quality is great IMO and makes great driving music. The kind that relaxes you but keeps you alert. It does not make you want to break stuff but it really does energize you if this is your kind of thing.

1885167776|5.0|I had the privilege of witnessing some content of this wonderful book come together during four years when I worked at Keller Williams Realty International as a Course Writer in Keller Williams University. Taking full advantage of that opportunity meant attending every session I could where the founder, Gary Keller, shared his vision, urged clear thinking, and coached people to think ever bigger, and bigger about their lives and business. In those many masterminds with top agents, and in private chat sessions too, I heard the themes of \\"The ONE  Thing\\" emerge. What resulted from Gary's persistence and vision is a book about leverage, about staying on track, and always refining thoughts through experience as you journey toward finding find your \\"one thing.\\" As Gary said when I heard him speak about the book as it was being printed, \\"I guess I could have called it \\"Focus\\", but then no one would have bought it!

0743289692|5.0|This autobiography COMPLETELY changed my mind about Islam.  I feel it to be a very important book that should be read by everyone.  Time magazine named Hirsi Ali one of the 100 most influential persons of our time a few years back.  Born in Somalia in November of 1969, she moved to Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia (a mostly Christian nation), Kenya (Nairobi), and then escaped from Germany to The Netherlands, where she became a Dutch citizen and a member of their parliament.  A stronger woman has probably not been born, to so escape the clutches of Islam completely.  She was mutilated at age five, beaten most of her life by her mother, whom I feel to have been mentally ill, forced to marry someone who was going to cart her off to Canada.  According to Hirsi, Islam is not a peaceful religion, and the terrorists are only the forefront of the majority of Muslim men.  It is, according to her, a very backward, desert culture religion that cannot change or question.  The rules are the same as when Muhammad was alive and fighting for control of the Sinai.  Very simplistically written, but it doesn't matter.  From one who knows Islam, has grown up in its schools and cultures.  Not soon forgotten.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|All my favorite English actors, beautiful and interesting story with many stories within it. I watch it over and over. I think the 'hotel' is a place I would like to be. The basis is that a young Indian man is working to convert his father's run down hotel into a beautiful residence for older people. The bigger story is the people, their lives, why they have come to the hotel and how their lives change while there.
0061950726|5.0|Although there are two separate stories going on at the same time, the author has written a very readable book. Both stories held me. The writing is uncomplicated and sure, and yet the stories are involved. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

B00BWJ6JO4|1.0|I am very disappointed in the streaming quality of the Amazon DVD.  I have watch programs many times before with prime and have never really had an issue with quality.  This purchased video (my first digital purchase) is totally disappointing.  The movie looks and sounds horrible.  I wish I would have just purchased the dvd.  If I could return it I would.,  The movie itself is great and I had seen it a few times before.  Definitely worth seeing but not on Amazons streaming service.  Just terrible!
B003WJQ74E|3.0|But what is its reputation? I want to know more about where the story came from. I want to know how experimental the format was at the time. With these older publications I would like to see more context provided with the text.

B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I expected a lot, both from the director and the actors in this movie, and I can honestly say that I was pleasantly surprised by how well this movie was done!  Great acting and directing, and the script was wonderful.  Even though it's long, it didn't drag at all.  A bit bloody, as are all of Tarantino's films, but it's worth it!  Highly recommended!

There's 2 modes, creative and survival. In creative, u have unlimited blocks and you can build anything.<br />In survival, you have to mine objects to craft things, like wooden planks, and take a certain amount to craft another thing, an example in this case is anything made out of wood.<br /> Anyways, totally awesome and fun, a MUST buy.

B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Back in the old days (a few years ago), anything that charged off a USB cord used only the trickle of power that PCs with USB 2.0 provided.  (About 5 volts x 0.5 amps = 2.5 watts).<br /><br />Now, however, we have power-hungry devices like the Kindle, the iPad, and various android tablets and related gadgets that will take more power if they can get it.  I've tried a bunch of car chargers, and when Anker offered me the this one in return for an honest review, I jumped at it, and am glad I did.  I'm leaving this in my car as my regular charger, and my old one is on a short trip to my \\"extra electronics\\" drawer.<br /><br />This car charger is built for people who want to fast charge two simultaneous devices: an iOS device with a port that puts out up to 2.1 amps, and an \\"android\\" device from a second port that puts out up to 1.5 amps.  (If you assume 5 volts, that gets you to 18 watts overall.)<br /><br />I don't have an android device or a Kindle, so I plugged my iPhone 4S into the \\"android\\" port and my iPad 3 into the \\"apple\\" port.  Charging was as good as I could reasonably hope - the iPad went from 17% charge to 22% in a 20 minute drive, which is pretty good given its oversized battery.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />- This puts out a lot of power to two ports.  If you need power under these specs, or if your device can adjust, it's nice, particularly since an iPad is so hard to fast charge.<br /><br />- The ports are wired separately, so using both at once won't reduce the charge in the individual ports.<br /><br />- It's relatively low profile (sticks out about an inch), a good looking apple-ish white, and fits well.<br /><br />Some observations:<br /><br />- This has no charging light.  That doesn't bug me (I'm more interested in whether my DEVICE says it's charging than whether the plug does), but was a surprise.<br /><br />- No cables are included, but I assume you have plenty of USB cables for your devices at this point.<br /><br />- Most devices are smart about how much power they take, but if you have an older device that is somehow not supposed to charge from a fast feed, I'd be careful.<br /><br />- It's kind of a pain to tell which port is the \\"apple\\" port and which one is the \\"android\\" port, so I circled my apple port with sharpie.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended if this fits your power needs.

B0082B7AJI|4.0|Made the plain scones and three of the tea sandwich recipes for a bridal shower and all got raves. Could have more photos, but overall very pleased. I don't consider it a problem but be aware that that recipes feature metric measures (including many baking ingredients measured by weight, as is standard outside the US) and European ingredients like self-raising flour.
B0091QSNEE|4.0|I downloaded the Dr. Panda doctor game.  My great nieces and a friend's child just loved it.  Then I got the veggie garden and the day care center.  Again they loved it.  They love this game also. However, the animals do not move from one spot to a table easily nor does the food come up easily when tapped on.  It takes multiple taps to get them where they need to go. Sometimes they don't go at all.  I have been waiting for the \\"fix\\" for this problem, as I see it has been mentioned in other reviews.  The children get frustrated and then want to leave the game.  Since it is not a problem in any of the other games I have on my kindle, I have to assume it is this game.<br /><br />I gave the app 4 stars because it is the first or second game the kids go to on my kindle.  So they do enjoy it.  But the younger ones will leave it rather than try to get it to work.  And then they complain to me.  They love all the Dr. Panda games.  They do not need anyone to explain how to play or manipulate the game.  Wonderful for their self confidence and learning!  I have just bought the supermarket and the beauty salon for them.
B004TTHLBE|1.0|I didn't get this book at all. Incredibly obscure. Requires leaps of logic beyond usual scifi writing. IF there is a message, I couldn't hang in long enough to get anything out of it.

B005LLX582|5.0|This film is an amazing combination of the small and the enormous.  On the one hand, it is moving portrait of growing up, with the timeless tiny details of the world as a child. On the other, it addresses the central questions about life itself, and the indifference of the universe. Brad Pitt, in his best performance to date, is remarkable as the tyrannical father, as is Jessica Chastain, as the compassionate mother.  Some may find the movie slow at times or bewildering, but it will linger with you for many days after viewing.  I saw it two years ago, and its memory remains evocative.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game. The graphics are amazing. I love horses so this is a great game. Great job.
B007STBUIW|5.0|What can you say, how many lives did this movie change?<br />I saw it when it 1st came out. Longest line to see a movie I ever was in.<br />Changed the way I see the water now. I was 14 then and have never been so scared at the movies in my life before or after. Acting was great, scenery great, music great.<br />The movie emptied beaches. It was that believable and that damn good.

B008X8RSTM|2.0|Liked the App but found no help with navigation.  When I first opened the App I was asked to download my desired maps (plural).  I did so and got a map of my local county.  I want to add another map and cannot find any way to get back to the map download page.  No menu, no. Help, no contact us - nothing.  Can't find any info online. Frustrating!  If I only get one map this product is not worth the price.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having lost a loved one of my own a few months ago, I am interested in different theories of what takes place after death. I especially like reading about 'out of body' experiences.I like to keep an open mind.But the stories do fascinate me. They do comfort me to a certain degree.But I do know that until we go through the process ourselves,we can't absolutely know what will happen and then we won't be able to pass that information on to others.But it is thought-provoking.
B009MFKO3M|4.0|Album is quite reminiscent of the Beatle's psychedelic days but not a knockoff. Wish I could have seen the band at Coachella!

B001EB5BCQ|5.0|When someone comes up with a list of the greatest debut albums of all time this incredible Dire Straits release has to be part of the discussion and this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release certainly does justice to one of the greatest guitar-oriented albums of all time.  As a guitarist myself I cannot tell you just how much joy I get from listening to this album.  Just to hear all the remarkable things Mark Knopfler does on the Strat here on this album makes me want to just get up and play until my fingers bleed!  The phrasing, the choice of notes and the great chunky rhythm  guitar in the background, the synchopation etc reminds me of another favourite guitarist of mine Jeff Beck especially on \\"In the Gallery\\".  As for \\"Sultans of Swing\\" what can you say except that the solo is what an angel would play if he had to do a solo; it is simply divinely inspired!  As far as Dire Straits albums go this is certainly their second best after the brilliant masterpiece of \\"Love Over Gold\\".  Every track is good making this along with \\"Love Over Gold\\" two of their more consistently strong albums.  This mlps is very well designed and assembled with a cardboard square replica of the original vinyl centre circle and a 16-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  What really surprises me is just how good this album still sounds after all these years which is a sign of a true classic.  The sound quality is excellent here as well and not overly compressed making this mlps release highly recommended indeed.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have purchased the other books in Stieg Larsson's series.  How could one NOT get this last excerpt of his series.  I am still reading this book, however, I am very intrigued and fascinated by his writing and the characters.  One cannot help but to love/hate certain characters in his book.  Great writing, great storyline and if you have not purchased this book and have read the other two books, do yourself a favor and purchase this last book; you will not be disappointed

B000P12LWY|2.0|The biggest historical in accuracy of all is the horrible actor that portrays Henry. He is neither fat nor middle aged. The costumes are cool and some of the actors competent but two speed Henry is not one of them. With only the sound on it would be hard to tell if his infected leg was bothering him or if he was having an orgasam.I couldn't make it through the entire series. It just became to stupid so I wound up watching a documentry about Henry the 8th instead.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! Made me happy and made me cry! Needs a sequel. Nicholas Sparks is always a great book to read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun but kind of slow! I love the mystery part and finding objects is phenomenal! I can't wait to get further in the game to find more!
B005ERYEGU|5.0|Great ideas for how to build, led, and manage a sales team. Plenty of opportunities to dream bug and change the game. Plenty of ideas for how to get things done. Especially liked the focus on development, empowerment, experimentation, metrics, and people feeling motivated by their work. Definitely going to read CEO Flow.
B001NE80P4|5.0|my boys loved this movie and they are excited to do the samn thing that the boys did playing sports and also be in drama club
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|This was a great read. A little slow at times, but overall the pace was kept up well. Dick manages to weave an ever-evolving plot along with several characters, culminating in a breathtaking climax. I'm still reeling.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|This movie is absolutely wonderful. I loved the story and the pacing. Everyone has talked about Michelle Williams portrayal as Marilyn Monroe, which was very good, but I have to give actor Kenneth Branagh a lot of credit for his role as Sir Laurence Olivier. He had his mannerisms and attitude down so well, even the tone of the voice sounded just like Olivier at times. The story is about filmmaker and author Colin Clark wanting to get into the film business. His first job was on Olivier's film The Prince and the Showgirl starring Marilyn Monroe. By chance he strikes up a friendship with her that takes him on the best and most heartbreaking week of his life. The emotional journey was heartbreaking and enjoyable (if that makes any kind of sense), but I simply loved it. Great film.

B002MG2ATY|1.0|This film raised considerable controversy when it was first released in 1991, with good reason. Oliver Stone largely based \\"JFK\\" on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's book \\"On the trail of the Assassins\\", although Stone essentially attempts to gather together every conspiracy theory espoused since Kennedy was shot in Dealey Plaza.<br />The most objectionable aspects of this film are Stone's depictions of Garrison as a fearless seeker of truth, & New Orleans resident Clay Shaw (who Garrison charged with conspiring with Lee Harvey Oswald to assassinate Kennedy) as a sinister, malevolent villain.<br />In reality, Garrison was a paranoid, irrational bully who persecuted an entirely innocent man in Shaw.<br />As is depicted in \\"JFK\\", the jury in the Clay Shaw case threw out Garrison's charges against Shaw. What isn't shown is the ongoing persecution of Shaw by Garrison after that case collapsed. Garrison almost immediately charged Shaw with perjury, alleging that during the trial Shaw had lied under oath in denying having ever met Lee Harvey Oswald or alleged co-conspirator David Ferrie. Garrison did this despite his knowledge that the testimony of his star-witness (Perry Russo) was at very least suspect, or more likely totally false.<br /><br />Following the perjury charge Clay Shaw sought the protection of a Federal Court, asking for an injunction against Garrison proceeding with the perjury charges, or any other charges related to the Kennedy assassination. For those such as Oliver Stone who regard Garrison as some sort of hero, here are some of the comments that the Federal court judge made when granting Shaw an injunction against Garrison's attempts to further prosecute him:<br />\\"To characterize the facts (of Garrsion's prosecution of Shaw) as unique & bizarre is no exaggeration\\"...\\"Shaw was first interviewed (by Garrion's office) in December 1996...Garrison testified that at that time Shaw was not considered a suspect & was not advised of his constitutional rights, norwas he told of his right to counsel...just how Shaw was first selected to be interviewed (by Garrison) when he was not a suspect is another unanswered question in this case...(Garrison) offered no evidence to show any basis for his office's interrogation of Shaw concerning such a shocking crime...(Garrison's) failure to offer any explanation leaves this court with but one conclusion, that there was no factual basis for questioning Shaw regarding the assassination\\"<br />The Federal Court judge went on to dismiss Perry Russo as a credible witness & noted Garrison's office's use of hypnotism & Sodium Pentathol injections to induce testimony from Russo favourable to the prosecution. The Court stated \\"substantial doubts are raised regarding the validity & objectivity of a state's case when the state resorts to such extra-ordinary tactics as were employed by Garrison on Russo\\". The Court noted that prior to Shaw even being charged Garrison had been advised by 1 of the police officers involved in the investigation that Russo had himself expressed doubts as to the veracity of his evidence.<br />The Federal Court noted that by the stage of the perjury trial Russo was refusing to testify any further against Shaw, & the Court concluded \\"all these actions with the subsequent doubtfulness of Russo as a witness show clearly that Garrison did not act in good faith regarding Russo's story..Garrison was aware of Russo's unreliability, yet he charged & prosecuted Shaw once, & now has again charged him for an offence stemming from Russo's story...Garrison's use of Russo is but one of several factors that reveal his mala fides (bad faith) in this case\\"<br />Despite the Federal Court's scathing comments & Perry Russo's refusal to provide any futher testimony against Shaw, Garrison unbelievably appealed to the Supreme Court, resulting in Clay Shaw's financial ruination via the legal costs incurred in defending himself against Garrison's relentless persecution. Ultimately, sanity prevailed & the Supreme Court upheld the Federal's Court's injunction against Garrison. Tragically, Clay Shaw died penniless, before he could complete his action for damages against Garrison.<br />Oliver Stone should hang his head in shame at his portrayal of Clay Shaw as an evil conspirator, rather than the persecuted victim of Garrison's lack of integrity & malevolent abuse of power & process.<br />There is one final point to be made in relation to Stone's defamatory portayal of Clay Shaw. The key scenes in \\"JFK\\" are those that attempt to depict Oswald as an innocent \\"patsy\\" caught up in a conspiracy by nameless conspirators to frame him. This begs the question - if Oswald was innocent of involvement in Kennedy's assassination, how on earth would Shaw be guilty of any crime - it wouldn't have mattered how many times Shaw did or didn't meet Oswald. Despite this obvious contradiction, Stone insists on depicting Shaw as a glowering, sinister caricature of villainy.<br />Like I said, Stone should be ashamed of this sort of misrepresentation of the truth.

This is a well-organized and highly encouraging guide to reducing our household waste output, as well as making us think about what we choose to bring into our homes as well. Even though I've followed Ms. Johnson's blog for a while, I enjoyed new stories about her own and her family's path to waste reduction and a more fulfilling and enjoyable life. My family of two adults and two teens has halved the amount of garbage that we dispose of each week by implementing just some of the changes suggested in \\"Zero Waste Home.\\" Give it a try--you might like the changes you make!

B00785P2QC|4.0|I've been playing for three days and it's been fun building my city. Patience is the key because you want to do so much but you have to pace so you can learn what is good and how to handle disasters and environmental issues. Not equivalent to Simcity but just as fun.  It plays while your away so it doesn't make you live this game all day. Buy to advance faster if you like or opt to wait for it to be given. Most things I'm figuring it out without instructions so for this reason  four stars
B006GWO5NE|5.0|When my Kindle stopped charging, I contacted Amazon.  The support person I talked to was Fabulous.

B006YB9VJU|1.0|46 Bytes to be exact, just the text of some website URLs are too long for that much memory. Sony also fails to mention that bit of information on their website. Most of the android NFC tags have 1 KB, which served most of your needs for these devices. Don't waste your money on these pretty tags, they're useless, unless you only plan on using them as settings or app launchers, ridiculous!

B0061PEAUY|4.0|I don't usually read books of this genre, but in search of something different, I chose this as I'm an avid fan of the series \\"Bones\\". I had difficulty keeping track of all the characters, but enjoyed the pace and energy of the plot as it unfolded. It was a quick and enjoyable read, and probably will lead to me reading more of the literary version of Temperance Brennan.

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It took exactly a decade, but Peter Jackson has finally followed up the LOTR franchise with the first installment of The Hobbit.  Clocking in at just under 3 hours, this film bears some semblance to the three LOTR films, but in other ways it is quite different.<br /><br />First the similarities.  They include a large ensemble cast with many key roles, distinct and unique personalities, and great dialogue from everyone.  There is also the awesome soundtrack, essentially a symphony for the movie with its melodies rooted in romance classicism.  The film also has two great choral pieces, one of which was also featured in the first movie trailer.  Then there is the beautiful make-up, costume design, set design, and incredible detail of the weaponry, animals, and other non-human characters.  And finally we have the awesome cinematography that shows the best of both New Zealand and of Peter Jackson's imagination in bringing Middle Earth to life.  As for the differences, there are few but they are key.  The first big difference is the mood of the film.  There is no romance in this film; distinctly different from the LOTR films which featured one or two key romances per film.  Instead of romance, we have more comedic action.  Whether it be the dwarfs cleaning up Bilbo's dishes, or fighting the trolls, or escaping from Goblin town, the action sequences in this film bear strong semblance to the many Chinese kung fu classics of Jackie Chan.  This is in strong contrast to the action scenes from the LOTR films, which are closer in feel to the grim, gritty fight scenes in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.  Possibly the biggest difference is the visual clarity of The Hobbit.  The 48 frames/minute clearly stood out when I saw this film in Digital 3-D.  On Blu-Ray 2-D, the visual clarity also stands out like no other Blu-Ray I have ever purchased.<br /><br />The only drawbacks to this package are twofold.  First, this is the theatrical version, with the extended version due out later this year.  Second, there are no previews of the next film, as that was only available online.  Overall, still a great film to own and watch.er this year.  Second, there are no previews of the next film, as that was only available online.  Overall, still a great film to own and watch.

B0019LZV4E|5.0|Blood, and guts, and gore everywhere. Although the movie gets a bad reputation for having lots of gore, there is actually not that much gore other than in the reprise of the song &#34;Johanna&#34; which is basically a montage of Sweeney killing people. Fantastic and deep plot, and may be buying this instead of renting next time.

B003568FR6|5.0|Quick background information: I'm in my mid-30s and have 3 young children. I only had about 5 or so pounds to lose, but I really wanted to tone up. The problem: between family, work and school, the last thing I have time for is to set aside an hour or more to work out consistently. So when I saw that I could do this workout in such a short amount of time, I figured it was worth a shot. I didn't expect much, but by the time I finished Level 1 I was shocked by the results: flatter tummy, firmer butt, and some definition in my arms! Normally, I absolutely HATE working out, and lose interest in my \\"exercise of the moment\\" but seeing the change happen so quickly with this program has really motivated me to stick with it. I did miss a day here and there, but even with my schedule I am able to be consistent.<br /><br />I realize that some people may be put off by it, but I love Jillian's \\"drill sergeant\\" style; I need someone to tell me to push through the pain. It also helps that she has a similar petite frame that I have, so I can kind of envision what I have the potential to achieve.<br /><br />UPDATE: I moved onto Levels 2 and 3, and I have to say that I didn't enjoy the exercises as much as Level 1 because I found them awkward to do, and very hard on my knees. What I ended up doing was going back to Level 1, but using heavier weights. Then when I got back to Levels 2 and 3, I substituted the painful exercises (like the squat thrusts ad mountain climbers) with more intense versions of Level 1 exercises.

B0054SMIH6|4.0|Pretty good  movie if you aren't looking for a deep-thinking exercise. I like McConaughey, and he brings a fairly predicable, standard performance in this one. If you are looking to relax and kill a couple of hours, this is a good choice.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many ideas for &quot;we're bored&quot; moments. AND with all these projects there's a good reason not to fold laundry.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|It started off strong, but the entire second half of the season was nothing but time-wasting episodes (except for &#34;Clear&#34;) building to an epic showdown in the season finale...that never happened. If you're going to spend an entire season building to an epic showdown, then you better damn well deliver. Season 3 didn't. It's obvious with all the turnover with the writers and show runners this show has no idea where it's going. Absolutely NOTHING was resolved by the end of Season 3, and the entire emotional climax of the finale hinged on the death of a character everyone hates. FAIL! I don't expect the show to be exactly like the comic, but the difference in quality between the comics and the show is now overwhelming. Whereas the comics provides readers with likable characters and dramatic storytelling, the show takes those likable characters and craps all over them to the point viewers are BEGGING for their deaths and the storytelling is equivalent to a blind mouse navigating a maze that has no end. Not only that, but viewers are given absolutely no incentive to continue watching Season 4...so I shan't.

B000UYJR7I|2.0|Samuel L. Jackson is legendary and he has the unique ability to turn even a strange movie like this, into something that is worth watching. Black Snake Moan is a really ridiculous story, full of odd symbolism that just really doesn't make any sense. Jackson plays Lazarus, a loner who lives on a farm in the middle of nowhere. He's a deeply religious man, whose wife just left him for his brother. Lazarus responded to this by locking himself away and putting all he has into his farm. One morning he finds a badly beaten girl, with a reputation, laying in the road and decides to help her, but he soon comes to believe that this girl is possessed and that God sent her too him for help. Not knowing what to do, Lazarus takes this sex crazed, drug addict and chains her to the wall of his house. Throughout this film, there are all kinds of symbols that don't make any sense. There are scenes featuring an old blues singer talking nonsense, scenes of the town that we almost never see, and perhaps strangest of all, there are moles added to Jackson's face, something you don't see except it cases of a biography. As for the performances, they were terrific, This is the best performance I've ever seen Christina Ricci give and she really gave Jackson a run for his money. Jackson, was also great, giving what you expect to see from him, albeit with less swearing than usual. The performances were really the only thing this film did have going for it as the events that take place just don't make any sense. The film jumps around, leaving things unfinished, and personalities seem to change as often as the wind blows. It's a pet peeve of mine, but I really hate when great performances are wasted on a film that is so poorly written, that it's almost unwatchable. Black Snake Moan is sloppy, jumps around without finishing things, and at times just doesn't make sense. It was an interesting idea with a terrific cast, but the people behind it were clearly in way over their head and just didn't really seem to know where they were going or even what they were doing.

0762434279|3.0|The book doesn't really live up to it's title in that it doesn't teach you what you need to do to become rich.  The author's examples and illustrations are vague and unhelpful, such as his guidance to pay yourself first as well as how to invest in real estate or start-ups.<br /><br />One point he makes which is very true is that we must all continue to improve our financial intelligence.  Although this book will not increase your financial intelligence one iota, if it motivates you to pick up some other books that are actual personal finance books and commit to learning then it is probably worth the money spent.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this author, you should probably do a google search on him and see what pops up.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Interesting movie however too violent for younger viewers. I really think Jennifer Lawrence has a long career ahead of her
B007VUA7VO|5.0|No reason not to have this app. I use it on an old iPod Touch 2 and a Kindle Fire. It tells how long long you have to use your d vice in various ways.

B005LAII8A|3.0|The premise of Looper is fascinating and carried lots of potential for a riveting movie.  However, in execution it falls far short of it's potential.<br /><br />To begin with there are several inconsistencies and holes in the plot and time travel paradox.  The movie sets up a world with specific rules and then proceeds to break them making it increasingly difficult to suspend your disbelief.  Why for instance, would the Mob who has to use Loopers to kill and dispose of bodies, indiscriminately kill Bruce Willis's character's wife?<br /><br />Secondly, there are many completely unnecessary scenes that never get developed and contribute very little to the story.  There's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character's girlfriend who is introduced several times but then is completely dropped.  Additional time is dedicated towards Kid Blue who accomplishes virtually nothing and is extremely unsatisfying.<br /><br />Finally, if you're not a fan of violence and blood especially that associated with children, then this is not the movie for you.  Children are both the victim and the perpetrators of large amounts of violence.<br /><br />However, despite these details, I still found myself enjoying parts of the movie simply because the idea and premise behind it were fascinating.  Would have been better with some extra time and energy dedicated towards tightening up the plot holes as well as the plot itself.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I like that I have both in one package blu-ray & DVD and HD it's very good one :) I recommend that

B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Bloomberg's news coverage is first rate, and the stocks are easy to pull up.  The stock charts are good, but not excellent.  What would make them excellent would be the ability to put in 90 and 200 or 300 day average lines.  However, no additions are allowed to the charts.  That's ok, the app is still very good.<br /><br />AD2
1407109375|4.0|\\"...I got through this book very quickly, as I did the others. Collins has a true talent for writing a hell of a page-turner...This kind of book is difficult to write a review of partly for that reason - I would hate to be less vague and inadvertently include spoilers, but trust me when I say that s*** is going down all over the place here. Having read the book finally, I'm more excited to see how they'll present it all in the film adaptation - it is sure to be pretty visually dynamic. I am also NOT looking forward to the film adaptation, though, because I spent the entire last third of the book yelling OHMYGOD and weeping like a small, emotionally disturbed child...Mockingjay ended up being my least favorite of the trilogy, but that in no way means I didn't like it. I still think they're all phenomenal, and a great contribution to the dystopian sub-genre. Just, you know, if you're a total sap like me, maybe read it with a box of tissues handy or something, and not in the middle of the night if you live with someone who is a light sleeper, since you might wake them up with all the crying-out in shock and disbelief.\\"<br /><br />For the full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger

030758836X|4.0|I kept thinking throughout the book what an organized and disciplined mind the author would have to have to pull off such a diabolical creature as Amy. Nick to be frank is sadly not unlike some people I've met - I don't like him but I think he and his character are much more common than Amy who is clearly psychotic. I would say the only criticism I have would be the difficulty I had swallowing the idea that anyone would believe Amy's story when she returned - it was just too fantastic and ridiculous to be taken seriously. I felt this section in particular was a bit rushed and wiped clean. I know many people have commented here about the ending, and I have to say that when I read the last paragraph I felt like I'd breen dropped off of a cliff. It took me a few days to come to terms with it, but now that it's had time to sink in, I feel it was the perfect ending. If I scroll back through the entire story it makes sense and is as disturbing as Amy's character is psychotic. I've just downloaded 2 of Gillian's other novels to my Kindle and can't wait to get stuck in. Looking forward to seeing the movie version when out and hoping that it's as much of a mind f*!@ as the novel.

0345529057|5.0|The books arrived in perfect condition.  They were fine. However, I gave them to my brother because I just ended up purchasing the set on iBooks anyway :)  Easier to bring with me everywhere on my phone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really like the characters in this book. of course - especially Anastasia and Christain.  I could identify with Anastasia when I was her age.  I believe that the author makes the characters come to life, making one wonder what they look like. You can visualize the clothes Ana wore, the descriptions of  the scenery, etc.<br /><br />Not into BDSM at all or the Harlequin romance novels, but I enjoyed this book and it was a good love story.  I was disappointed that Ana gave into some of the BDSM, but okay with the Vanilla Sex parts of the book.  They could make this into an R movie without the porn parts.<br /><br />But --- they have to really make sure that they pick the right actors for the all the parts, especially Christain, Anastasia, Elena and Taylor.<br /><br />I have this Trilogy on my kindle and have read it a few times.  I am going to buy the books to have in my book collection.  Hope the author writes a few more books on Anastasic and Christain.
0312997221|5.0|I just finished the unabridged audiobook today. Besides the fact that the narrator did an excellent job, the story was compelling and extremely well told. There are thrillers that sometimes get lost in the details, too much action and bravado, too much testosterone, lots of sex, blah blah blah. \\"Avenger\\" was a clean, lean story that didn't meander uselessly but stayed on point. I really liked it and will be recommending it to my husband. A good finish as well.<br />Highly recommended.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|I think that Emma Thompson's age was perfect for Elinor in terms of what the movie  is conveying about English society at the time. Both daughters are forced by their circumstances to be neurotically desparate to find husbands, and their wretchedness is emphasized by the slightly \\"too\\" old Elinor. Whether the character was that old in the book, I don't care. That detail works perfectly in this screen version.<br /><br />Another interesting fact is that all the men in the movie seem to be victims of the crazy world they've created. The Hugh Grant character tiptoes around like he's about to topple over at any moment. The colonel is in his own kind of daze. The married men are miserable or driven to looniness or mean-spiritedness. The only free spirit is the younger sister's early suitor, but of course he's punished by both his society and his conscience for his behavior.

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Redline is a movie that I was told, by a friend, to watch and put it off for a long time. When i finally sat down and watched it, I immediately wanted to watch it again. It's some of the best visuals you'll ever seen in an animated film and the story (though slightly one-dimensional) is just so fun that you almost have to like it. I honestly hope more people buy this blu ray, because I really want to see a sequel to this one.
B00AQSF6BO|2.0|Aficionados of Flamenco Guitar should be advised: this album is not what you may be expecting.

Therefore I was very disappointed to have purchased this in mp3 elsewhere where the policy was no returns. I'm both wasting my money and encouraging Vicente to keep doing albums like this at the same time.

I am a huge fan of Eric Clapton so finding this album and this artist was a great find for me....he is much like Clapton in his sound with a little different twist.  Usually I have to listen to an album several times before it has me hooked....but this one hooked me at first listen.  Yes, I would recommend this music to anyone who is a true Clapton type Blues fan..  very, very good music. I will be looking to his older music now to see what other treasures I have missed.

B003CSV7TK|5.0|----Miracle on 34th Street is a beautifully written gem of a picture, with a pitch-perfect balance between cynicism and human kindness. Edmund Gwenn IS Santa Claus in his Academy Award-winning performance, and Natalie Wood belies the oft-repeated criticism of the overly-acted, under-performing \\"child actor,\\" by delivering a performance that is at once as believable as it is tender.-----One performance to especially watch for: Gene Lockhart as Judge Harper; he is absolutely hilarious as a jurist of the Supreme Court of New York, worried about his reelection chances if he rules that Santa doesn't exist. William Frawley, as Harper's political guru is also especially effective.<br /><br />---- The depiction of the baser side of humanity takes the form of corporate greed, cynicism (on the part of Doris) and disbelief (Susan), and the mean-spirited smallness of a nasty little man (Macy's store \\"psychologist\\"). In addition, greed is frequently depicted among characters (Doris and the Toy Department Manager worry about losing their bonuses if they fire an apparently insane Santa---says the manager to Doris: \\"Maybe he's just a LITTLE bit crazy---like painters, composers, and some of those guys in Washington...\\").<br /><br />--- One of my favorite scenes is when a young Dutch orphan meets Kris (Santa) with her adopted mother. The mother explains to Kris that the girl was just adopted from Rotterdam, and that she doesn't speak any English. What follows is a darling scence where Kris speaks to the child in Dutch, and sings \\"Santa Claus\\" with her in the same language-----What modern audiences wouldn't know---but audiences in 1947 would--- is that Rotterdam was the site of one of the Nazis most infamous and horrendous blitzkriegs, which focused particularly brutally on civilian housing. The number of children and women killed in that city was appalling, and represented the highest fatality rate of children of any Nazi bombing raid during the entire war----the number of orphans left in Holland afterwards was very large, thus, this scene provides an additional emotional punch as audiences would realize the child was a survivor of a blitzkrieg.<br /><br />--- The very fact that this movie remains not only relevant, but only seems to increase in popularity, some 65 years after it was first premiered, speaks to its timeless element. I do believe that if Macy's Thanksgiving Day parades, and visits to Santa at the Mall were passe, modern audiences would probably have a more difficult time relating to the film, despite the timelessness of its subject. But the fact that our traditions have remained largely unchanged---most particularly in regards to how we, as a society, try to protect the imaginations of our children---the film still resonates. Even 65 years later, audiences still feel an unease when confronted with a small child's disbelief in anything magical and her very adult cynicism towards life in general....<br /><br />--- Miracle on 34th Street does not represent \\"great art\\" or a larger-than-life subject matter, but it does represent something far more precious: the enduring human need of faith, and the bounty one reaps from small acts of kindness.ft in Holland afterwards was very large, thus, this scene provides an additional emotional punch as audiences would realize the child was a survivor of a blitzkrieg.<br /><br />--- The very fact that this movie remains not only relevant, but only seems to increase in popularity, some 65 years after it was first premiered, speaks to its timeless element.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|It's very VERY rare that I find myself watching anything from Disney Animation Studios that doesn't have the Pixar logo somewhere in there, but when it came to my personal appeal for a film like WRECK-IT RALPH, I just couldn't resist. Thankfully, my non-resistance was rewarded with an eye-poppingly beautiful, wonderfully intelligent, and tremendously fun love letter to the era of arcade dominance.<br /><br />This film revolves around the character of Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), who is the villain of a game called FIX-IT FELIX JR., where he wrecks an apartment building in a style reminiscent of DONKEY KONG and RAMPAGE, and the character of Fix-It Felix Jr. (voiced by 30 ROCK's Jack McBrayer) just leaps from ledge to ledge and fixes everything, eventually resulting in Ralph being thrown from the building into a pile of mud. The game is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and Ralph is just tired of being separated from the other population of his game, relegated to live in a dump by himself. He's lonely. He joins a support group for other video game villains, and they try to help him through his malaise. He longs to no longer be the bad guy and to be appreciated by the people in his game, and begins a journey that crosses into different video games in pursuit of the one thing that will make the occupants of his game appreciate him: a medal. He journeys into a violent and serious first-person shooter HERO'S DUTY, populated by armored troopers led by Calhoun (voiced by GLEE's Jane Lynch) to steal the medal from that game, but ends up in a cheerful racing game called SUGAR RUSH where he meets that game's populace, including its ruler King Candy (voiced by FIREFLY/SERENITY's Alan Tudyk) and its lovable yet similarly-ostracized misfit Vannelope (voiced by Sarah Silverman). In traditional fashion, Ralph's departure from his own game may have doomed his game to be put out of order, and it also risks the candy-coated empire of SUGAR RUSH as well. In order to stop the threats to these worlds, everyone, especially Ralph, must embrace their character's attributes.<br /><br />As far as the themes of WRECK-IT RALPH are concerned, it certainly does harken back to other animated films, particularly the TOY STORY series in how it shows what your video game characters do once the arcade is closed. It's sometimes a little too familiar, but the inherent charm of the film and its reverence for gamer culture overcomes pretty much all of the film's flaws (of which there aren't really that many, anyway). Under the direction of Rich Moore, who makes his feature directorial debut here after years of working on shows like THE SIMPSONS and FUTURAMA, this CG-film is dazzingly animated, particularly in the brightly-colored cavity-causing land of SUGAR RUSH and the dark, apocalyptic high-def landscape of HERO'S DUTY. The voice work by everyone is excellent. The actors put so much of their personality into these characters, making them very vivid, but particularly standing out is the chameleonic work of Tudyk as villain King Candy, whose voice work on other animated work is also unrecognizable, but always excellent. The film is also packed with cameo appearances from characters from other classic video games from Sonic the Hedgehog to many of the characters from STREET FIGHTER II to TAPPER to PAC-MAN, and on and on. It's pretty much impossible to find all the different characters and games that are \\"easter egged\\" all over the film, which is actually one of the most fun parts of the film. Another brilliant and hilarious little moment is the using the tools of gorgeous computer animation, yet still having the apartment inhabitants of FIX-IT FELIX's game still move in stunted, 8-bit movement.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, the film tells a really enjoyable and smart story of people trying to defy their nature only to learn that what they needed to do was embrace who they really are. The only flaw I really found with this film was that it is a little too derivative at times. It echoes so many films of the Disney animated oeuvre, but there are very few films of the family animated variety that you can't say that about, and again, the film is just so charming that you can actually embrace some of those flaws.<br /><br />As someone who grew up during the era of the arcade, there's a few moments of the film that are beyond compare for taking a trip down memory lane; for instance, there are at least two time-lapse segments that show different games being put in the arcade, and I was watching, thinking \\"I remember that game! That was awesome!\\" quite a few times. It's always fun (and occasionally a little melancholy) to watch so much of your youth lovingly being put on display, and even on something of a pedestal.<br /><br />Two bonus things about the Blu-Ray disc worth mentioning: The \\"intermission\\" segments that Disney introduced on many of their Blu releases that start after you press the pause button are a great idea, but is done really terrifically here with uber-nerd Chris Hardwick hosting these little intermissions and giving you some neat little clues about the easter eggs within the film. Also more than worth the price of admission here is the inclusion of Disney's Oscar-winning animated short PAPERMAN, which is a return to good-old hand-drawn animation (with I believe has a blend of CG backgrounds), and is so tremendously moving and beautiful that I dare you not to tear up a little bit while watching.<br /><br />All in all, WRECK-IT RALPH is a very satisfying film experience, and you'll be hard-pressed to find many better animated films that came out this past year (with the exception of BRAVE, which just works better).<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars.ittle too derivative at times.

B003GXJ072|5.0|OLD MOVIE BUT I STILL LIKE TO WATCH IT.... GONNA GET ALL OF THEM EVENTUALLY I HAVE THE DVD'S BUT THE CONVIENCE OF THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER WITH MY AMAZON PRIME
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to the next one. I find it to be along the same lines as 50 shades without the 'toys' element. All in all it's a good read.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Luckily I got to see this at the theatre. Marvelous film of retired musicians and singers at a retirement home in England. If you enjoy characters and great acting, this one is for you. Also a great directing debut for Dustin Hoffman. Maggie Smith is fabulous as the opera diva Jean.Very highly reccommended.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|I would originally give this game 5 stars because I love it, but I can't remember my password. I have tried to have Gameloft send me a message via my email, but it has never arrived... I need help!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  I can sit for hours and play.  Even my grandchildren are getting hooked.  Need more lie it.
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|I was introduced to Wong Kar-wai through his earlier film [[ASIN:B004KVXC64 Chungking Express]], an extraordinarily sweet, humor-filled exploration of romance in early-'90s Hong Kong. The energy of the filmic technique, the colors, the music, and the performances of that film left an indelible impression on me and I knew that I needed to seek out more of Wong's output. Via this Criterion release I have recently seen In the Mood for Love and, to my great delight, this latter film is just as wonderful as its predecessor while also being quite different.<br /><br />In the Mood for Love is set in 1960s Hong Kong and is replete with the styles of the period. Like its predecessor, the colors in this film are quite vivid and the soundtrack, featuring an alluring waltz by Shigeru Umebayashi and Nat King Cole serenading in Spanish (!), is quite effective. Wong's mise-en-scene is impeccable. But unlike the infectious, popping energy of Chungking, Mood's tone is of repression -- the melancholy of unconsummated love. The deep reds and clouds of swirling cigarette smoke evoke a deeply erotic atmosphere, but like our two protagonists, Wong never allows the audience to succumb to our basic instincts, never resorts to cheap titillation. We watch these two people meet and fall in love with each other, grappling with the knowledge that they can never be together. There is no \\"plot\\" to speak of, only the fascinating relationship between these characters. The film is a slow burn, but never is it dull. Wong's film is a mature work that masterfully evokes a time and place, subtly exploring a love that can never be with great empathy and exquisite style.<br /><br />Criterion's Blu-ray provides a first-rate presentation of the film. The video transfer is filmic and gorgeous with rich colors, and the soundtrack is no less lush. Extras include trailers, deleted scenes, several documentaries and interviews, a separate short film by Wong, isolated cues from the film's soundtrack, and a bookletfeaturing a critical essay as well as a short story that helped to inspire the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a robust package for this beautifully romantic film and comes very highly recommended.
B000SEFNMS|2.0|The book had a good lesson, but the writing  style made it difficult to get into. The author seemed to ramble and change subjects too much, making it confusing and lose meaning.
B007R6X9IK|4.0|A friend told me to buy this CD.  It is awesome but it is really music to relax to.  I listened to it the first time in my car and I wanted to fall asleep.  This should be played at a spa when you get a massage.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how we get to update the app and we get daily challenge and little things like that. One thing that I will like to change is that it keeps on freezing while playing
B00571F26Y|2.0|This diet is similar to Southbeach and Dr. Adkins. Since my husband and I follow a vegetarian diet, this was quite difficult. All the meat substitute products contain wheat. We were constantly hungry and did not feel well. Even a large quantity of vegetables did not make us feel better. We did discover, however, that rice pasta is very acceptable, but it is pricey so it is not a good option for us. Unless you are one of the few people with a true wheat sensitivity the answer, as always, is not necessarily what you eat but how much. If you do have a sensitivity to wheat, you will know immediately when you put wheat back in your diet. When we returned to wheat, we felt better and quit staring into the refrigerator and cupboards to find something to eat.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|survivalcraft is so killing it in people's mine like mine, I'm trying to say is that it is so cool poeple
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Very fun game.  I liked it so much I shared it with my family.  They liked it so much I ended up buying them each one.  I bought this game for 4 of my family members for a total of five games when you include myself. They all love it.
B000002VRZ|5.0|The two tops songs on this CD are Green Grass and High Tides and Ghost Riders in the Sky.  Bought the CD just for those two songs.  The other songs are good, but those two stand out.
B00005RDRO|5.0|It's the best movie ever, with the greatest cast ever assembled. You will laugh until you cry, and then when you watch it again-you'll discover 100 jokes you missed the first time.

B00992CF6W|5.0|The block world has gotten 2 more fans. It is like playing house with building one, making beds, etc, but it's hard to get my kids off of it.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Excellent end to the Harry Potter series.  They did a great job of putting the story to life.  Bittersweet to see it end.  Sure glad they kept the actors from beginning to end.
B009IUH1N2|1.0|Crappy, unresponsive controls constantly kill you. I could swipe up to jump 3 times, but it would not register at all. Which is unfortunate, as the bright cartoon graphics look awesome and the soundtrack is fun.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I love this game it's kinda annoying how quickly your time runs out but I love the location of the game but I can't get past the second cave
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it is so addicting and fun it is exciting and cool I like it because the settings subway like how it looks and stuff so yeah
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is an inspiring, beautiful story that makes you want to have a journey of your own. I highly recommend reading it!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|There are a lot of choices with this app without paying anything extra.  The ocean waves ended up being my favorite and help me go to a &#34;Happy Place&#34; as I'm struggling to get to sleep.  It's helped train me to get to sleep without pills, so I am loving this app!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Simple and fun game. The story is easy to follow and the locales are neat. 3+ matching is easy to do, and the controls are responsive.
B00466HM28|5.0|This controller is the best to have if you need to create while on the road.  It easily fits into my travel computer case or suitcase and works easily with a number of programs including Logic and Reason.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|The puzzles are great.  But even after you purchase the app you have to pay even more for any hints.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really fun it's kind of like temple run and that even makes more fun all I have to say is it is really fun.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|If only Facebook enabled me to get chores done...  This app makes it easy to check in.  I wish I could access my games.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|The increasing difficulty of each wave can make it a bit annoying if you hate dying a lot, but going through the skies and shooting down UFOs makes it all<br />worth it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched season 1 on PBS and am now watching season 2 on my Kindle Fire HD.  I can watch whenever I have time and the Kindle is so clear and crisp and the audio is incredible.
B000Q9IZ5C|1.0|Never watched any Firefly before this one, and probably never will watch any after. The plot of this movie is so banal, stupid and superficial it defies words. The acting and directing - an insult to intelligence. I regret every minute I wasted watching it and I am sorry I didn't stop it midway. Sheer and utter waste of precious time. Refrain.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really loved the book sad yet sexy!!!! Must read!!! Heart felt romance. Never knew about the Dom/sub relationships existed untill this book!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent price, excellent shows, excellent shipping, etc.  I love the stories, characters, setting, etc.  If you haven't tried it, you just gotta!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorite app for my kindle fire! It is expensive (seven dollars is too much for me) but I have enjoyed it! If you want anything better than this, you will need to download the real game onto your computer.
B005HSL626|5.0|I'm 7 and you shoud get this. I know you will love it, I don't know how I know but I promes you WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! You get to pick a blade, and slice fruit. But wach out for the boms!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|watched this with my kids, boy and girl and they both liked it.  I think my daughter probably liked it a little better than my son, just because of the girl.. worth watching.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Action, drama, a little comedy, and some real life stuff make this series well worth it. I am hooked. Kurt Sutter has built a dynamic series that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you never know what will happen!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've always wanted to breed horses. This app gives me a first taste of what I have to do. I LOVE IT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BREED HORSES.
B007SGM084|4.0|It was indeed a page turner. It made you think. I am ready for the next book in that series.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|Had it for quite a while now, no issues, seems to be working as advertised just fine. Can't go wrong.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|Was not sure what to expect.  Heard several negative reviews, but I feel that a great job was done putting the story together and building the characters.  Can't for the next two movies.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Action, drama, a little comedy, and some real life stuff make this series well worth it. I am hooked. Kurt Sutter has built a dynamic series that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you never know what will happen!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The graphics and colors of this game are amazing. I love the scenary. This is one of the best Temple Run that I have played. It is similair to the other Temple Runs but different enough to keep it interesting and a little more unpredictable.
0393327655|5.0|While the author's personal opinions shine through quite obviously in many areas he does present a seemingly valid argument against the tolerance and/or acceptance of the blind faith which seems to be so prevalent throughout our society today.
0307474275|3.0|This is a very entertaining book. Period. If you're looking for a light read that will help you kill time at the airport or if you wanna read something during the summer while you take the sun at your favorite beach, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />It's fast-paced and very engaging. The characters are (most of the time) believable and you'll find yourself turning the pages to find out what happens next. It's about 500 pages and if you read fast, you will have finished it in less than a week.<br /><br />But stay away from it if you are looking for a masterpiece of literature. And that is the problem with most so called critics here. They can't accept this book for what it is: a story written to entertain us. It will not answer whatever questions you may have about God, life or religion. It's just a simple story, albeit a gripping one.<br /><br />Read Shakespeare if you want some heavy reading.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I was expecting a little more at the beginning... kind of dragged and was hoping that my kids would not lose interest.  Liked it though and in the end it was very powerful.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Plays well. Like the sounds and music, graphics are good. Easy to see the playing field. Free game but the ads are annoying and are not what I have an interest in, which means I have no desire to see them or d/l their suggested content at all. If it is the app makers company that made the games in the ads it disappoints me and I would have been more interested in games I looked up rather than ones they shove in my face. This game on its own is good, and if the makers other games function as well as this one does then it is worth trying.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|i cant put it down! very addicting. plenty of options to choose from for play. this will keep me busy for a long time.
B00138H6TQ|5.0|as expected for this Spanish group rock-pop style  this is another masterpiece!!!! I  hope you enjoy as well as I did
B00AGKH6D8|4.0|I like instrumental music that doesn't fit neatly into any categories, like Voodoo Dogs or Action Figure Party.  This cd has elements of The legendary Funk Brothers (Track 5), JB's, AWB, 70's fusion and some jam bands.  The fretwork on the last song reminded me of Tommy Bolin on \\"Stratus\\".  Nice, well worth the investment.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Bad acting, bad story line, don't waste your money! This movie is not even a little scary,and is very predictable. The only reason I finished it is because I paid for it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|lack of many parts. i rather use the web based facebook instead of this one. it will be better if includes advanced settings like the web
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love this CD. I started listening to Mumford & Sons before they became famous and each album just keeps getting better
B005LAIIHG|2.0|Unfortunately I did not enjoy this movie as much as so many others did.  As a matter of fact I was hugely disappointed.  A friend of mine had encouraged me to see this movie, and rather gushed over it.  \\"It was so amazing\\", she said.<br /><br />The strange thing about this movie is it really resembled [[ASIN:B005UKJX4E The Tree Of Life]] and [[ASIN:B000RZAENG The Fountain]]. Although The Life Of Pi definitely had a more developed story than the other two.<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail, I will however give my customary parent of children warning:  The movie plays on Pi's name where they change it to \\"P!ssing\\".  And they say \\"P!ssing\\" over and over.  Over twenty times.  They just won't let it die.  Kids, adults, narrator, everyone is saying it.  Its not that funny and the thick Indian/Hindu dialect makes it so hard to even understand the joke, all you hear is \\"P!ssing\\"!<br /><br />Then there is the scene where Pi is standing with his back to the camera and you see him urinating on the tarp of the boat.  The animated lion then turns his rear to Pi and sprays Pi in the face with urine. Necessary to the movie? No. Big movie execs thinking the adults will love it? Yes.<br /><br />And that's the end of my parents with children warning.  Unless of course you want me to cover the many animals that are attacked and die.  But I am sure others have warned you of that.<br /><br />I believe the story could have been more believable, understanding, or even more enjoyable had they not had the weirdness intermingled in it.  You never know if the story is real or if he is hallucinating.  Even at the end when he is explaining to the investigators what really happened on the ship, he tells two different stories.  Supposedly one is true, but they are both so far out you really don't know which one is true at all.<br /><br />The human acting was pretty good, however the animation of all of the animals really took away from the story rather than enhance it.<br /><br />Overall, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Friend or enemy. I struggle with giving it one star even, but since it wasn't near as bad as The Tree of Life I am going to up it a star.  I wish I could understand and enjoy these \\"great\\" movies as much as everyone else does.  But I just. don't. get. it., I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Friend or enemy.

B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Awesome new characters and allies, which adds to the almost never ending fun.  They made a great choice by making it free. One thing I California all the things that you could possibly buy to make your chances of winning better.
B000067QMD|5.0|No need to pump in one cup and transfer to the baby's bottle- just pump into the advent bottle and use these to securely seal with rings that usually hold the nipples.  This saved me an enormous amount of time and kept me from washing a million dishes!  If you are determined to breastfeed for at least 12 months and have to work/pump a lot, these are a must!!  I used with the breastpump conversion kit and it was a lifesaver!
B00846REIS|2.0|Too much sex and not enough story.  Some parts were interesting but too much sex and not enough story included.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Slow moving for me. Also, they did not show who shot Lincoln. Did not like the scene at the theater.
B008RTE066|5.0|Not the greatest movie of all time, but as a Beatles fan, it is a must have.  First saw it at Beatlefest in 1974, which pre-dated the VCR, so it was one of the big attractions of the show.  It has now been carefully restored, and is of excellent quality.  I'll leave it to others to parse the mix on the soundtrack.  I found it fine, but then again, I've only heard it through the TV, as my surround sound system was a victim of Hurricane Sandy.  The added extras are also fun.
B00BF11STU|3.0|You've got to see this one. Great storytelling, non-glam, no-BS. NOT a propaganda film- which shocked me, frankly (I was expecting something very Hollywood, very different.) This is a great film. I can't believe I'm saying that. It goes from point to point very rationally over the course of a decade; you can follow the plot clearly. The lead role is played brilliantly by Jessica Chastain. A real tribute to the people behind-the-scenes in intelligence who are just doing their jobs, doing them well, playing by the rules they're given and the authority of Congress, the Pres and the people. The film does NOT cop out on addressing ethics and moral issues on getting info via torture, even if it makes it seem less terrible than it is (so it could be approachable without being overwhelming). Thankfully, the film doesn't think FOR you, and it doesn't attempt to confuse you (doesn't need to to tell a good story, drawn from true events). It does not draw conclusions or stoke nationalistic hype. Love it. If anything, it's understated. Very straightforward. Powerful without the typical tools of manipulation that films and media seem to make these days. High quality versus 'slick'.<br /><br />That was my first impression. After thinking about it and discussing it with friends, I realized that it makes the killing of Osama Bin Laden look like an assassination- where is the court of law? Are we, the US, judge and jury?<br /><br />Some important considerations...
B0061S073A|2.0|I would have given this product review 5 stars but unfortunately I forgot my password and the ONLY way to exit FreeTime if you do that is to restore your Kindle to factory defaults.  Which means we had to re-download everything we ever downloaded to our Kindle - and it means we lost everything that was not saved elsewhere - like pictures we had taken with the Kindle.  Due to this MAJOR flaw I would recommend only buying this app if you remember to write your password down!!
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|Clutch is one of the most consistently amazing bands in the rock world, putting out one killer cd after another for longer than most bands even exist. This Cd is another awesome addition to their discography... BUT, I can't say it's one of my FAVORITE Clutch cd's, if that makes any sense.<br />THIS BRINGS UP A QUESTION about the amazon rating system. I would give this five stars in comparison to most of the music released today. No doubt. But there have been Clutch Cd's that I just could not stop listening to (self titled, blast tyrant, and \\"beale street\\" for example), but this one... it's an excellent cd overall but for some reason it doesn't seem to stand out to me on the whole as much compared to their other cd's. That's why I've given it four stars... my logic is that people looking up reviews for a new Clutch Cd probably are already familiar with Clutch, and wonder how it compares to what they already have heard. I'd be happy to hear opinions about this or discuss it if somebody disagrees with what I am saying.<br />Again, it's a very good Cd, heavy and fast, great musicianship, great vocals. A little straightforward for Clutch, in my opinion, almost even a little safe, I hate to say, but still rockin'. ALTHOUGH... I have to say that \\"Gone Cold\\" is a standout gem here. That song just gets into my soul... the bluesy, slow, gritty little tune with an amazing vocal line by Mr. Fallon. If there was any justice in the world, this song would be on the top of the charts right now.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|although my daughter is an avid reader on her kindle and son in law is a full service user with just about every testosterone related app known to mankind loaded and functional-lol.  Me--i'm retired and a reader and gamer and this is turning into my favorite game-supplanting the Mah-Jongg game I first loaded.  Don't quite know why I like it so much but I do really like it--as you can tell, i'm a fan of matching and match 3 games.  On my pc I also like hidden objects combined with puzzle games but I find that due to the vision loss suffered d/t an accident, these games--FOR ME ONLY-do not lend themselves to pleasurable play,  but the match 3 and matching games are fun for me on the smaller screens of the kindle ( and yes, I DO have the Kindle Fire).  Anyway, I love my Kindle and I love gaming on it and this is my favorite game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the second book! I'm usually excellent at predicting what's going to come next, but not in this series!! It was so refreshing to learn some more colors of the Fifty Shades. That's what I was hoping for and happily received! Of course, there was also the seductiveness that captivated me, not to mention making life more interesting ;). Though I've learned a few things, I was more interested in the backgrounds of the characters in this book, and was pleased to have my hopes for further character development more then fulfilled! On to, sadly, the final book!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I had bought this for my son since he loves Harry Potter and I thought it would be nice of me to watch a couple of these with him.  Well that happened and now I'm watching them in order myself!  Great movies even for adults!

0786891416|4.0|Basing a book off of a character's living is a hard task to do. People who watch Castle are crazy fans, and tampering with that image could disrupt that. But, it was a success. It was pretty much an episode of Castle, slammed into a book, and lightly seasoned with a sex scene, page 149, by the way. It is very easy to picture Heat and Rook as Beckett and Castle, giving the fans a whole different plot twist and scenario. It is a great book, and it is worth the buy. I am buying the second one right now!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This one is another winner from the Lord of the Rings saga.  I can watch it over and over again and it never gets old.  My son loves it too!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is one of the very best series I have ever seen!  Combines love, adventure, my favorite Viking era, intrigue, fairly accurate daily life.<br />Highly recommend, although if you are even reading this, you probably are planning to buy it, anyway.<br />So, what are you waiting for?

B00B49L7JY|4.0|Inspirational story and entertaining documentary. Sugar Man was so incredibly humble and gracious, not to mention an amazing talent. Recommended!
1607066017|5.0|I started reading comics with Spider-Man. It was a fun ride until the new Marvel decided that Spider-Man needed to be retcon'd to make movies and sell more lunch boxes. After the One More Day story line, I stopped with Spider-Man and comics all together.<br /><br />But then I started reading forums years later about this crazy new comic out by the awesome, Image Comics. I went to my local comic book store and bought Issue #7 and was blown away.<br /><br />Since then, I've started a pull list where I get every Saga when it comes out because it sells out pretty fast where I live.<br /><br />The art is awesome. The writing is great. And each turn of the page is surprising.<br /><br />This is not your boring super hero comic. It's a colorful, beautiful, violent, creative, and surprising univers to read about.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very well written.  Very smart premise and clever ideas.  The author made me like and care about the characters.  Would like to read more in this vein from this author.  I hope he's got more of this in him.
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|game is fun.  it offers variety but is still limited by levels.  it would be nice to be able to play any previously passed level over again as any of the 3 characters for additional bonuses.  also the amount of coins you earn is not enough to progress as one should in this game.
0765325950|5.0|loved the story, action packed the whole way.  Very obvious however that it was written by sanderson,  Very similar to the end of the mistborn series
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|It took me several times of playing this before I realized that I could play against the computer or actually have two people playing on the kindle.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I thought this was a novel I got caught up in the story, The ending I did not like as<br />He said it was a tutorial.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Can't wait for the sequel. The problem solving and mystery was pretty good. I love games like these. Awesome game!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great book. I would recommend this book for all who enjoy great novels. Especially those who need an understanding of themselves who are trying to understand mental illness. It has all the literary elements that makes it a great novel.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good, easy to read Grisham book, with the usual predictable ending. Maybe not his best novel, but still worth a read.
B003DTMUOE|4.0|Bien escrito, aunque me parecio demasiado pretencioso y lleno de lugares comunes, igualmente creo que es un aporte por lo que recomiendo su lectura.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great Book, great delivery and a few nights of getting to bed late because I could not put it down
B00B6ELPIU|3.0|Remember 'Silent Shout'? Or time signatures, or melody? You can forget about those, because the latest incarnation of the Knife takes a wrecking ball to those foundations. Anyone who's been paying attention to their discography though, especially their collaboration with Planningtorock & Mt. Sims for 'Tomorrow, in a Year', won't be that surprised at this new album (especially when you hear 'Wrap your Arms Around Me' & 'Raging Lung').<br /><br />I can get on board with about a third of the album. Candidly, I have hard time listening to the rest of it straight through. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate avant garde aesthetics like Neubauten, Dead can Dance, I can get into electronic glitch like LFO. But the line between experimental brilliance and downright self indulgence has definitely been crossed. The more challenging tracks (Cherry on Top*, Crake, Old Dreams Waiting to be Realized, Networking, Oryx, Fracking) consists of stretched out sounds of flutes, creaking metallic hinges or rusty swingset, prolonged moaning/yodeling, kazoo, whatever you can hear in nightmarish scenes of a horror movie; there's little structure or focal points in these. They're all fascinating, rich organic samples, but for me, it sounds way more fun to produce than to listen to.<br /><br />And I know they love piling on the vocal filters, but personally I enjoy Karin's vocals unfiltered because it already sounds unique by itself for any human voice; I'm not thinking \\"that's an interesting female singing voice\\", I'm thinking \\"that's an interesting sound\\". FWIW I definitely still want to catch them live if they come near me, and I look forward to what they'll be doing next.<br /><br />*EDIT: I'm actually enjoying this track, 'A Cherry On Top' much more with every successive listen.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Some of the stories were really interesting, some were just ok. Overall, I thought it was pretty good and would recommend it if the price goes down a bit.
1844488748|5.0|This is a nice book and very detailed. Easy to learn from it. Beautiful pictures! Can't wait to get started!
B000FA675C|5.0|I really like this book a lot, I will recommend to buy it and have in your kindle or Bookstore
0749939893|4.0|It's a well written book about an interesting topic. I'm not sure how much I believe that children bear the wounds of their previous lives on their bodies and that families have really found the family described by their child as having been their family in a past life. I do believe children may have past lives and remember them. I bought this book b/c my toddler kept telling me about his family before us when he lived in Baltimore (we live in Philadelphia) and how they died in a car crash, and he was terrified of going on the highway long before he could tell us why.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game. I love it it is very addicting. This would be a great game to pass time or just relax. You really need to buy it.
B00136JT3Y|5.0|Nice Prock, for sure.  Typical Pink ... a little Rock mixed with a little Pop, with some introspective tunes as well.  Very Nice!
B00005KARK|4.0|I have always had Disney movies in my home, VHS, from back in the day... now with grandbabies I buy them on DVD now..It arrived quickly and as pictured, the disc looked like new and plays well..
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great characters, great story and believable writing make this a personal favorite for me.  Very much looking forward to more.  Oh, yeah, zombies and gore helps keep ones interest, too!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game makes the time go by. I was on vacation and this game really time consuming. Fun, fun, fun.
B008BRC6NS|5.0|Great music! Great dance music. I love driving in our car and making the music loud. I also have it on my ipod.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I HAVE ALL OF THE ICE AGE MOVIES SO FAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT ANY MORE IF AND WHEN THEY ARE MADE.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Every song is great!  lovin' this new american idol artist. Can't wait for the next album!  If you liked him on Idol, you'll like the album.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The Silver Linings Playbook,a novel written by Matthew Quick is a strong, meditative and deeply satisfying literary read. Passionate yet plain spoken, Quick explores the primal need WE have to find the happy ending so that tragedy can be tolerated or at least understood.
B008YI91HS|5.0|Steven Spielberg is a movie genius! This is one of the greatest suspense/action/sci-fi movies that I've ever seen!<br /><br />Soundtrack 10/10<br />Graphics 9/10<br />Acting 9/10<br />Storyline 10/10<br /><br />I love being able to have it with me at any time on Amazon Mobile!
B005LAIHGI|4.0|I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING INTO THE MOVIE AT FIRST BUT IT WAS OK AFTER I WATCHED IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH..
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great story. I can't wait to read the next in the series. I will probably pick up another Sanderson book next.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Great movie, keeps you on your edge seat. Dont know how much of its true. Get a bowl of popcorn and enjoy!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|not a bad game. runs well enough and I like that it is not just a bunch of hidden object games. puzzles could be a little bit more challenging though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of those books that preclude cooking, cleaning, shopping.  Everything went undone until I finished this book.  Usually I can figure out where the author is going, but not this tiem.  Recommend
B001DUDKEY|4.0|Movie was a great watch. True to the period. Recommend you watch this one, worth it. Very romantic at times.
B00B23O96A|1.0|This is a confusing CD. Its not clear to me exactly what has happened to Eric Clapton, but he appears to<br />be turning into Rod Stewart. Perhaps his next CD will be a Christmas Album. The mixture of music on the CD is strange, to say the least.<br />The worst track is the classic \\"Still got the Blues\\". His voice does not hold up to this work which<br />needs sustained notes. However that is the least of the issues with the track. For some bizarre reason he uses a nylon string guitar for<br />something approximating a guitar solo. This is a puzzling choice. A muted subtle nylon string guitar ?<br />Its just a very very disappointing CD.<br />I suspect Eric Clapton needs some sort of jolt back into a more consistent reality. I would suggest recording a Blues Album with<br />Tom Waits in a shack near a suitable swamp in Louisiana.
1416550550|5.0|Excellent read. Great way to spend time getting away from it all. Would recommend it to all my friends....lots of twists and turns.
B008JFUO36|3.0|Oblivion is a movie that projects great expectations, delivers even greater CGI (its smoothless and does not detract from the movie as some CGI in other movies has a propensity to do); however the ending causes this film to fall quite flat on its face. If there is one major fault with Oblivion its that there is a sense that it draws far too much on past Sci-fi movies (I found myself comparing particular scenes with previous movies - some now quite dated - and such reminicising drew me away from the premise of the movie itself) with the ending (no-spoiler here) pretty well much a re-make of a well known, but now quite aged, sci-fi movie (and thus a real dissapointment).<br /><br />Oblivion is an enticing journey into a post (dare I say) apocalyptic earth where mankind has truimphed over an alien invasion and Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is left behind with his 'partner' as a cleanup/srvice 'mechanic' of giant sea converters. I am not a particular fan of Tom Cruise however here he harks back to his better days of acting and carries this film with a degree of aplom. Like other reviews here, I agree that there is far too little exposure of humans and how they have coped with life in this new earth and much more could have been done to explore this aspect, furthermore I was very dissapointed at the 'Alien' content and the ending of the film reinforced this, as in how they, the aliens, were portrayed.<br /><br />Oblivion started well, built at an excellent rate, maintained my interest - and then suddenly fell completely on its face at the end :( (hence only 3 stars and 2.5 of them are for the CGI and the futuristic technology). Oblivion is still a good movie to see, however in my 'humble' opinion its not a GREAT movie - watch it, enjoy it, just don't have too many great expectations (sic).
B000IDEQTK|4.0|Movie was a great watch. True to the period. Recommend you watch this one, worth it. Very romantic at times.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I got this set on a Amazon special for a steal.  It's Rocky, what more can  you say.  The price was fantastic, the disks work fine, came as described.  Set was a gift for my husband who loves it, can't be happier.
B004PR71JC|4.0|There were only a few songs I wanted on this cd but was unable to buy them individually; i like the CD, though, but wouldn't have bought it except to get the three songs I wanted
B002D0L0R2|5.0|This is my 8 year old son's favorite movie ever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app except that there always seems to be a lag to the server.  and maybe a few more ways to get more energy. _
B00004RJ71|5.0|The acting in this movie can leave a little to be desired at some points, but the plot and story to me was fantastic.  I had this movie on VHS, but had no vcr anymore, so had to get the DVD to show my husband.  He also loved it.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|i just got this game and i LOVE this game and i got blaze the cat for free<br />best game then sonic 4 series i just hope that sonic dash will be for the kindal fire soon
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great. I would have never thought of something like this. There were so many unexpected twists and turns. I would think this would happen but the exact opposite of it happens. Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer and I can't wait to read any other books she writes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the handiest calculator ever, and I always know where to find it! I use it at least twice a week.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Awesome! Totally Awesome! Sometimes a cliche' from a teenage pothead really does say it all, without the absurd &#34;fluff,&#34; and (thankfully) without the pseudo-overly-intellectual-dime store-literary criticism (as is so often, and un-reassuringly viewed in this important area). What happened to summing things up in SIMPLE terms? My review is: Awesome! Totally Awesome! Nothing more. Nothing less.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is the best game in the world you gatta try this game i just now tryed this game
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is always accurate like any  other calculator but it works quicker and better than all the combined calculators in the world
